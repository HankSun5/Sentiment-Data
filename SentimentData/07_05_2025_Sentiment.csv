44253544,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157759,1746573607,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Accusation: Trump Crypto Ventures Labeled ‘Open Corruption’ by US Congressman,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-crypto-open-corruption/,"The world of cryptocurrency is no stranger to controversy, but when it intersects directly with high-profile political figures, the temperature rises dramatically. Recent comments from a U.S. Congressman regarding Trump crypto ventures have ignited a fiery debate, bringing accusations of misconduct and conflicts of interest squarely into the digital asset space. This isn’t just about technology; it’s about ethics, transparency, and the potential entanglement of personal financial interests with public service. Why Are Trump’s Crypto Ventures Raising Concerns? The spotlight has recently intensified on the various digital asset activities linked to former President Donald Trump and his family. These ventures include the launch of non-fungible token (NFT) collections and, more recently, speculation surrounding a meme coin allegedly tied to the Trump brand or family, often referred to as the Donald Trump meme coin (DJT). While some see these as savvy business moves or innovative ways to engage supporters, others, like U.S. Representative Gerry Connolly, view them through a much more critical lens. In a candid interview with DL News, Representative Gerry Connolly , a Democrat from Virginia, did not mince words. He described the involvement of Trump and his family in these cryptocurrency endeavors as amounting to nothing less than “open corruption.” This is a significant accusation, suggesting a blatant disregard for ethical boundaries rather than mere potential conflicts. Connolly’s concerns stem from a broader view of Trump’s political career, particularly referencing the initial period of his presidency. He stated that the first 100 days of the Trump administration were “rife with conflicts of interest.” This historical context is crucial because it frames the current crypto activities not as isolated incidents but as part of a pattern where personal financial interests are perceived to potentially influence or benefit from public position or political power. What Constitutes ‘Open Corruption’ in This Context? When a figure like Gerry Connolly uses a term as strong as “open corruption,” it implies more than just a conflict of interest; it suggests a situation where private gain is openly prioritized or pursued through means enabled by political influence or status. In the context of Trump crypto activities, the accusation likely revolves around several key points: Leveraging Political Status: Using the former President’s name, brand, and political following to promote and potentially profit from digital assets like NFTs and meme coins. The value of such assets is often heavily reliant on hype, speculation, and the perceived endorsement of the associated figure. Lack of Transparency: Questions surrounding the ownership, control, and financial beneficiaries of these crypto ventures. Who truly profits? Is it Donald Trump directly, his family members, or associated entities? The opaque nature of some crypto projects can exacerbate these concerns. Potential for Market Manipulation: The significant influence a figure like Trump holds means any comments or actions related to a specific coin or NFT project could drastically impact its value, potentially benefiting insiders or creators at the expense of retail investors. Preferential Treatment Allegations: Connolly also cited “preferential treatment given to figures in the digital asset industry.” This suggests concerns that the Trump administration, or a future one, might favor specific individuals or companies within the crypto space, potentially those connected to or supportive of Trump’s ventures, leading to unfair advantages or policy decisions. These points collectively paint a picture where the lines between political activity, personal branding, and financial gain in the unregulated or lightly regulated crypto market become dangerously blurred. The accusation of “open corruption” highlights the perceived lack of effort to conceal these potential conflicts. Exploring the Donald Trump Meme Coin Phenomenon The emergence and subsequent volatility surrounding the Donald Trump meme coin , often symbolized by the ticker DJT, perfectly encapsulate the controversial intersection of politics and speculative digital assets. Meme coins are cryptocurrencies inspired by internet memes or popular culture, often lacking underlying fundamental value and driven primarily by community hype and social media trends. The DJT coin specifically gained traction amid rumors of a direct endorsement or launch by Donald Trump or his son, Barron Trump. While the origins and official connection remain debated and somewhat murky, the coin’s value has been heavily influenced by speculation tied to the Trump name. This situation raises profound questions about: Investor Protection: Meme coins are notoriously volatile and risky. If a political figure promotes or is perceived to be associated with such an asset, it could draw in unsuspecting retail investors who might be swayed by the political connection rather than understanding the inherent financial risks. Political Ethics: Should political figures, especially those who have held or seek public office, be involved in promoting highly speculative assets where their influence can directly impact market value? Regulatory Challenges: How do existing financial regulations or potential future crypto regulation apply to assets tied to political figures? The current regulatory landscape is still evolving, making these situations particularly complex to address. The DJT meme coin saga serves as a live example of the challenges Gerry Connolly and others are pointing to when discussing conflicts of interest and potential corruption in the digital asset space. The Broader Implications for Crypto Regulation The controversy surrounding Trump crypto activities is not just about one individual; it has significant implications for the ongoing debate around crypto regulation in the United States. As more political figures engage with or launch their own digital assets, the pressure on lawmakers and regulatory bodies like the SEC and CFTC to establish clear rules increases. Here are some potential implications: Increased Scrutiny: Political involvement in crypto will likely lead to greater scrutiny from regulators, ethics watchdogs, and the public. This could accelerate calls for stricter rules on transparency, disclosure, and potential conflicts of interest for public officials dealing with digital assets. Defining Digital Assets: The nature of assets like NFTs and meme coins challenges existing definitions. Are they securities? Commodities? Collectibles? The regulatory response will depend heavily on these classifications. Political Polarization of Crypto: As crypto becomes intertwined with political figures, it risks becoming another politically polarized issue, potentially hindering bipartisan efforts to create sensible regulation. Focus on Market Integrity: Allegations of preferential treatment or potential market manipulation related to political figures’ crypto ventures highlight the need for regulations that protect market integrity and prevent abuse of influence. Gerry Connolly’s strong words reflect a growing concern among some policymakers about the potential for the digital asset space to be exploited for personal gain by those in positions of power. This concern could directly influence the direction and speed of future crypto regulation efforts. Navigating the Intersection of Politics and Digital Assets The entanglement of politics and digital assets presents a complex landscape for everyone involved – politicians, regulators, investors, and the crypto industry itself. While proponents argue that political engagement can bring mainstream attention and potentially favorable policies to the crypto space, critics warn of the inherent risks when personal financial interests collide with public duty. Key challenges and considerations include: Challenge Description Transparency & Disclosure Lack of clear rules on when and how politicians must disclose crypto holdings or affiliations. Conflict of Interest Situations where a politician’s personal crypto investments could influence their policy decisions or public statements. Market Integrity Risk of market manipulation or unfair advantage due to a politician’s influence or access to information. Public Trust Erosion of public trust if political figures are seen as using their position to profit from speculative assets. The accusations leveled by Gerry Connolly underscore the urgent need for clarity and ethical guidelines governing the interaction between politics and the burgeoning world of digital assets. Whether it’s the specifics of the Donald Trump meme coin or broader involvement in the sector, the political implications are significant. Conclusion: A Critical Juncture for Political Ethics and Crypto Representative Gerry Connolly’s blunt assessment that Trump crypto ventures constitute “open corruption” highlights a critical and increasingly visible challenge: the ethical boundaries for political figures engaging with speculative digital assets. The controversy surrounding activities like the Donald Trump meme coin brings to the forefront concerns about conflicts of interest, transparency, market integrity, and the potential for political status to be leveraged for personal financial gain. As the crypto market continues to evolve and gain mainstream attention, the interaction between digital assets and politics will remain a focal point. The strong reactions from figures like Gerry Connolly signal that policymakers are watching and that calls for clear rules and ethical standards for politicians involved in crypto are likely to grow louder. How this tension between political engagement and the need for ethical conduct and robust crypto regulation is resolved will significantly shape both the future of digital assets and public trust in government.

SHIB bulls and bears are battling with almost equal strength. A 29 trillion SHIB trap could determine Shiba Inu’s next direction. Shiba Inu (SHIB), Ethereum’s well-known meme coin, has entered a critical trading zone. With prices hovering around the $0.000012 mark, both bullish and bearish traders are closely watching for its next significant move. This level puts SHIB at a point where neither side has clear control, meaning the next price swing could heavily influence the token’s path in the coming weeks or months. $0.000012: A Key Technical Level for SHIB From a technical perspective, the $0.000012 level is a notable support for SHIB, considering how often the price has tested it. The level’s importance also means it could quickly turn into a strong resistance point if the price decisively breaks and stays below it. Because of this, market analysts are looking closely at other indicators to understand SHIB’s current price action.

Per the South Korean newspaper Hanguk Kyungjae , Lee made a series of pledges to younger voters while speaking at an event in North Chungcheong Province on May 6. The candidate said: “I will create a safer environment for investment. That will help young people build up their assets and plan for the future.” South Korean Presidential Frontrunner: I Will Legalize BTC ETFs Lee said his government would institutionalize crypto spot ETFs. He also said that he would build an integrated monitoring system to police the crypto sector.

He said that he would “bring about a reduction in crypto transaction fees.” It is unclear at this stage exactly how Lee would seek to fulfil this promise. In South Korea, crypto exchanges are currently free to set transaction fees as they see fit. However, Lee’s government, should he win on June 3, could theoretically seek to impose a cap on exchange transaction fees. In recent months, exchanges like Bithumb have sought to boost trading volumes by offering their clients commission-free trading for limited periods. These promotions have proved enormously popular among South Korean traders, with Lee’s camp possibly taking note. Candidates Courting Younger Voters? Money Today reported that analysts think Lee is trying to win over younger voters by making manifesto pledges about “issues that are very important to young people.” Lee has been relatively quiet on crypto-related policy matters in the lead up to June’s poll. May 6’s comments are the first time he has spoken about his crypto stance on the campaign trail. Lee Jae-myung, candidate for the South Korean presidency, speaking at an event in a market in North Chungcheong Province on May 6. (Source: Chuncheon MBC News/Screenshot) It is likely that his comments are a response to recent crypto pledges from Lee’s main rival in the polls, the ruling People Power Party (PPP)’s candidate Kim Moon-soon. Earlier this month, Kim pledged to let South Korea’s state pension fund and the sovereign wealth fund make direct crypto investments . The PPP has also rolled out seven crypto-related manifesto pledges ahead of June 3 . The party says it plans to do away with restrictive banking rules for crypto exchanges. How Sincere Are Crypto Manifesto Pledges? Skeptics will likely cast a cautious eye on the two candidates’ comments. Hanguk Kyungjae noted that Lee’s Democratic Party pledged to green-light crypto spot ETFs ahead of last year’s legislative elections. The newspaper wrote: “Although the party won a landslide victory in the election, there has been no significant progress made on the matter since then.” Lee promised to build a “society that gives opportunities to young people.” He added: “A society that neglects young people will only regress.” DPK intensifies impeachment threats against Supreme Court justices https://t.co/eG9i8HvCqO — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) May 6, 2025 Recent opinion polls put Lee around 20 percentage points ahead of Kim, with almost 50% of popular support. The election was sparked by the recent impeachment of President Yoon Suk-yeol, who unsuccessfully attempted to declare martial law in December 2024.

His startup, NewLimit , focused on developing treatments to reverse the effects of aging, has just announced a substantial funding round, signaling strong investor confidence in its ambitious goal of extending healthy human lifespan. What is NewLimit and Why the Buzz? Founded over four years ago by Brian Armstrong, former GV partner Blake Bryers, and stem cell professor Jacob Kimmel, NewLimit is not your typical crypto venture. Instead, it operates at the frontier of genetic reprogramming, aiming to revitalize aged cells and restore their youthful functions. The company believes it can increase how long people live a healthy life by manipulating cellular genetics. The recent buzz surrounds their impressive Series B funding round, which successfully raised $130 million. This follows a $40 million Series A two years prior, demonstrating accelerated progress and growing investor interest. The round was led by prominent venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins, with participation from notable investors like Nat Friedman, Daniel Gross, Khosla Ventures, Founders Fund, Dimension Capital, Elad Gil, and Patrick Collison. Progress Towards Age Reversal NewLimit claims to have made considerable strides in its research. Blake Bryers shared insights into their progress, revealing the discovery of three prototype medicines specifically designed to reprogram liver cells. Lab experiments reportedly show that this rejuvenation process can restore the cells’ ability to process fat and alcohol, mirroring the function of younger cells. How do they measure this? Bryers explained they compare how cells from younger and older individuals respond to substances. An older liver cell treated with NewLimit’s epigenetic reprogramming techniques begins to behave more like a younger cell. Leveraging AI in Biotech A key component of NewLimit’s strategy is the integration of artificial intelligence into their drug discovery process. While human trials are still several years away, the company is actively developing new anti-aging medicines using an AI model. This AI model allows NewLimit to simulate numerous experiments computationally, drastically narrowing down the potential candidates. Only the most promising machine-generated drugs are then moved to laboratory testing. Data gathered from these lab experiments is fed back into the AI model, refining its capabilities in a process dubbed a ‘lab in a loop’. This approach significantly accelerates the identification of potential treatments for age reversal . The Road Ahead and the Competitive Landscape Despite the promising early results, NewLimit acknowledges that the path to human trials is still long, estimated to be a few years away. The current focus remains on leveraging AI and lab research to identify and develop more effective treatments. NewLimit operates in an increasingly competitive field. Other well-funded startups are also tackling the challenge of extending lifespan through biotech . Notably, Retro Biosciences, backed by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, raised $180 million and is reportedly seeking a $1 billion Series A. Altos Labs, which launched with an impressive $3 billion in 2022, also counts prominent figures like Jeff Bezos among its backers. This highlights the significant capital and talent flowing into the longevity space. Why is Brian Armstrong Investing in Age Reversal? For readers primarily interested in crypto, Brian Armstrong ‘s involvement in NewLimit might seem like a departure. However, it reflects a trend among tech billionaires to invest wealth and resources into ambitious, long-term projects addressing fundamental human challenges, such as health and longevity. It demonstrates a diversification of interests beyond the core crypto business, focusing on potentially transformative scientific breakthroughs that could have profound impacts on society. Conclusion: A Glimpse into the Future NewLimit’s successful $130 million funding round is a significant milestone in the pursuit of age reversal . Backed by prominent investors and led by figures like Brian Armstrong , the company is pushing the boundaries of biotech and AI to develop treatments that could fundamentally alter the human experience by extending healthy life. While the journey is still in its early stages, the progress reported by NewLimit offers a compelling glimpse into a future where cellular rejuvenation and enhanced longevity might become realities.

44254254,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157761,1746574802,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Solana Name Service Gets Powerful New SNS Token from Bonfida,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/solana-name-service-sns-token/,"The world of decentralized identity and human-readable addresses on the blockchain is constantly evolving. If you’re involved in the Solana ecosystem, you’ve likely encountered the Solana Name Service , which allows users to replace complex wallet addresses with simple, memorable .sol domain names. Now, a significant development is unfolding within this vital infrastructure, spearheaded by the team at Bonfida. Understanding the Solana Name Service Before diving into the new token, let’s quickly recap what the Solana Name Service (SNS) is all about. Think of it as the DNS (Domain Name System) for the Solana blockchain. Instead of sharing a long string of characters for your wallet address, you can register a .sol domain, like ‘yourname.sol’. This makes sending and receiving transactions much easier and more user-friendly. The SNS ecosystem has grown steadily, facilitating easier interaction with decentralized applications (dApps) and wallets across Solana. It’s a crucial piece of the puzzle for mass adoption, making crypto feel less intimidating for everyday users. Why a Dedicated SNS Token ? The Shift from FIDA For a while, the Solana Name Service was closely associated with Bonfida’s native token, FIDA. Bonfida, a decentralized exchange built on Solana, was instrumental in developing and launching SNS. However, as the SNS ecosystem matured, the team identified a need for a dedicated token that could more directly serve the community and governance needs of .sol domain holders. According to Bonfida’s announcement, the FIDA token, while valuable for the broader Bonfida platform and its DEX features, didn’t fully align with the specific requirements and future vision for SNS governance and community incentives. This led to the strategic decision to introduce a new, purpose-built token: SNS. The introduction of the SNS token marks a pivot towards empowering the community directly involved with the naming service itself. It’s designed to be the primary driver for governance and participation within the SNS ecosystem going forward. FIDA vs. SNS: A Quick Look To clarify the distinction and the shift in focus, here’s a simple comparison: Feature FIDA (Previous Role in SNS) SNS (New Role for SNS Ecosystem) Primary Utility Bonfida DEX features, Staking, some SNS integration Governance for SNS, Ecosystem incentives, Future SNS-specific utility Governance Focus Broader Bonfida platform decisions Specific proposals and direction for the Solana Name Service Community Alignment Bonfida users .sol domain holders and SNS participants Future Development Remains core to Bonfida platform Foundation for future Solana Name Service features and growth While FIDA will retain limited utility within the Bonfida ecosystem, the SNS token is positioned as the cornerstone for the future development and community engagement of the Solana Name Service. Benefits for .sol Domains Holders So, what does this mean if you own one or more .sol domains ? The introduction of the SNS token is primarily aimed at benefiting the very users who make up the Solana Name Service community – the .sol domain holders. The core benefit revolves around governance. Holding SNS tokens is expected to grant holders voting rights on proposals related to the future of the Solana Name Service. This could include decisions on: Feature development for SNS Changes to domain registration or renewal processes Allocation of ecosystem funds Integrations with other Solana protocols This shift empowers the community, giving them a direct voice in shaping the service they use and rely on. It aligns the incentives, ensuring that those invested in the success and utility of their .sol domains also have a stake in the governance and evolution of the underlying service. Beyond governance, the SNS token may also introduce new ways for holders to participate in and benefit from the ecosystem, potentially through staking mechanisms or other incentive programs designed to encourage active participation and network health. Exploring Bonfida ‘s Role and Vision Bonfida’s decision to launch the SNS token demonstrates their continued commitment to the Solana ecosystem, particularly the infrastructure layer provided by the Solana Name Service. As the initial developer of SNS, Bonfida is facilitating this transition to a more community-governed model for the naming service. This move aligns with the broader trend in decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 towards greater decentralization and community ownership. By separating the governance of SNS from the core Bonfida DEX token (FIDA), Bonfida is enabling the SNS community to forge its own path and priorities, fostering a more focused and engaged user base for the naming service itself. Bonfida will likely play a crucial role in the initial distribution and technical implementation of the SNS token and the new governance framework, guiding the ecosystem through this significant transition. The Growing Landscape of Crypto Domain Names The introduction of the SNS token also highlights the increasing importance of Crypto Domain Names in the digital asset space. Services like Solana Name Service (.sol), Ethereum Name Service (ENS, .eth), Unstoppable Domains (.crypto, .nft, etc.), and others are building the foundational layer for a more human-friendly decentralized web. These naming services are not just about simplifying addresses; they are becoming digital identities, linking profiles, avatars, and other data to a single, easy-to-remember name. The move by Bonfida to give the SNS community its own governance token underscores the value and distinct identity that these naming ecosystems are developing. As the space of Crypto Domain Names matures, we can expect increased competition, innovation, and potentially more specialized governance models like the one being implemented for the Solana Name Service. How to Engage with the SNS Ecosystem For existing .sol domain holders or those interested in acquiring one and participating in the ecosystem, here are some actionable steps and considerations: Stay Informed: Follow Bonfida and Solana Name Service official channels for announcements regarding the SNS token distribution, claiming process (if any for .sol holders), and governance portal launch. Understand Governance: Learn how the proposed governance model for the SNS token will work. Your SNS tokens will give you a voice in future decisions. Acquiring .sol Domains: If you don’t have one yet, you can register .sol domains through platforms integrated with the Solana Name Service. Owning a domain is key to being part of the core community. Explore Utility: Look for dApps and wallets on Solana that integrate with SNS, using your .sol domain for transactions or identity. Potential Challenges Ahead While the launch of the SNS token is a positive step towards decentralization and community empowerment, challenges may arise. These could include: Ensuring fair and wide distribution of the SNS token. Engaging the community effectively in governance participation. Maintaining the security and stability of the SNS infrastructure during and after the transition. Navigating potential complexities in the relationship between the SNS ecosystem and the broader Bonfida platform. Successfully addressing these challenges will be crucial for the long-term health and growth of the Solana Name Service under its new token-governed structure. Conclusion Bonfida’s introduction of a dedicated SNS token for the Solana Name Service marks an exciting evolution. By shifting governance power and incentives specifically to the community of .sol domain holders, the team is fostering a more focused, engaged, and decentralized ecosystem for human-readable addresses on Solana. This move not only strengthens the Solana Name Service itself but also highlights the growing significance and distinct value of Crypto Domain Names within the broader Web3 landscape. It’s a clear signal that the future of digital identity on Solana will be increasingly shaped by the hands of its users.

The program, revealed Tuesday, allows individual and corporate users to borrow cash using Bitcoin as collateral without selling the asset. Mallers wrote on X that people shouldn’t have to sell the best-performing asset to access cash. The entrepreneur, who recently took the helm at Twenty-One Capital, a rival to Tether-backed Strategy, emphasized that the offering allows users to unlock the value of their Bitcoin holdings without liquidating them. Strike targets wealthy clients with high-value, credit-free Bitcoin loans The new Strike Lending product will first launch in specific U.S. markets and be followed by an international expansion. The offering is tailored for high-net-worth individuals and institutional clients. It provides 12-month loans from $75,000 to $2 million at a minimum 12% APR interest rate with the option to pay monthly or to pay back the full interest and loan balance at the end of the 12-month term. It is also worth mentioning that Strike will offer no origination or early repayment fees. These Bitcoin-backed loans will not go on credit reports and have no bearing on credit scores. To provide competitive terms, Strike works with third-party capital providers that have been vetted and who retain the collateral during the loan term. However, Strike remains legally responsible for the collateral the whole time. Strike’s launch comes amid a broader resurgence in crypto credit markets, which are recovering from the dramatic 2022 downturn that saw major players like BlockFi, Celsius, and Genesis collapse. While the sector remains below its 2021 peak—down 43% from the $64.4 billion high, according to Galaxy Research —lenders such as Coinbase and Xapo have recently expanded their offerings. As of Q4 2024, centralized finance (CeFi) leaders Tether, Galaxy, and Ledn collectively hold loan books worth $9.9 billion, comprising nearly 89% of the CeFi market and 27% of the broader crypto lending ecosystem, which includes crypto-collateralized CDP stablecoins. Bitcoin loans redefine financial products as Strike expands into crypto lending Bitcoin loans represent a shift toward expanding how the world’s largest digital asset can be used as a financial product. By offering liquidity without exchanging ownership of the coin, borrowers gain liquidity and maintain their exposure to Bitcoin. Strike is positioning itself as a modern alternative for accessing liquidity during what appears to be a bullish phase for Bitcoin and digital assets. As Mallers pointed out, “If #bitcoin continues to grow faster than your borrowing costs, your asset appreciates faster than your debt.” The growing demand for on-chain lending is also evident in Ethereum, where the decentralized lending sector now exceeds $34 billion. This launch also coincides with Mallers’ recent appointment as CEO of Twenty-One Capital , a Bitcoin-focused financial firm backed by Cantor Fitzgerald. With Mallers now leading both Strike and Twenty-One Capital, questions about potential synergies between Strike’s lending service and a larger Bitcoin financing strategy are emerging.

44254537,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157762,1746575458,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,US CBDC Rejection: Treasury Secretary Calls Digital Dollar Plan a Sign of Weakness,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-cbdc-treasury-rejection/,"Big news dropped recently concerning the potential future of money in the United States. The conversation around a US CBDC , or Central Bank Digital Currency, has been ongoing, but a recent statement from a high-ranking official has certainly stirred the pot. According to reports, the US Treasury Secretary has expressed a clear lack of support for the idea of the Federal Reserve issuing its own digital currency. What Did the US Treasury Secretary Say About the Digital Dollar? The core of the recent report, initially shared by Watcher Guru on X, is the stance attributed to the US Treasury Secretary . The Secretary reportedly stated a lack of support for the Federal Reserve moving forward with a central bank digital currency . Even more pointedly, the concept was described as a “sign of weakness.” This isn’t just a casual comment; it’s a significant signal from a key figure in the nation’s financial leadership. This statement adds a notable voice to the ongoing debate surrounding the creation of a digital dollar . While the Federal Reserve has been researching and discussing the possibility, indicating no immediate plans but exploring the technology and implications, this Treasury perspective introduces a strong note of caution, if not outright opposition, from the executive branch’s financial arm. Why is a Federal Reserve Digital Currency Being Discussed? The idea of a Federal Reserve digital currency stems from several factors driving central banks worldwide to consider their own digital money. These include: The rise of private digital currencies: Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and stablecoins have highlighted public interest in digital forms of money, prompting central banks to consider offering a state-backed alternative. Improving payment systems: Proponents argue a CBDC could potentially offer faster, cheaper, and more efficient payment systems compared to existing infrastructure. Financial inclusion: A digital dollar could theoretically provide easier access to financial services for unbanked or underbanked populations. Maintaining monetary sovereignty: In an increasingly digital and globalized financial landscape, some argue a CBDC is necessary for a central bank to effectively implement monetary policy and maintain control over its currency’s ecosystem. International competitiveness: As other nations explore or launch their own CBDCs, there’s a concern the US could fall behind in financial innovation without its own US CBDC . Despite these potential motivations, the path to creating a digital dollar in the U.S. is complex and faces numerous hurdles. Is a US CBDC a Sign of Weakness, and Why? The Treasury Secretary’s characterization of a Federal Reserve digital currency as a “sign of weakness” is particularly noteworthy and warrants deeper examination. While the specific reasoning behind this phrasing wasn’t detailed in the initial report, we can infer potential arguments that align with such a view: Undermining the Existing System: Critics argue that introducing a CBDC could disrupt the existing two-tiered banking system, potentially drawing deposits away from commercial banks and concentrating financial power with the central bank. This could be seen as a sign of weakness in the private banking sector or an overreach by the government. Privacy Concerns: A government-issued digital currency raises significant privacy concerns. Opponents fear it could enable unprecedented government surveillance of citizens’ financial transactions, which some might view as a characteristic of less free or weaker societies where individual privacy is compromised. Competition with Private Innovation: The U.S. has a strong history of private sector innovation in payments and finance. Some argue that a government-backed digital dollar could stifle this innovation or unfairly compete with private stablecoins and payment solutions, implying a lack of confidence in the market’s ability to evolve on its own. Security Risks: Centralizing a nation’s currency infrastructure into a single digital system could create a massive, attractive target for cyberattacks, potentially exposing the country to significant financial instability – arguably a sign of systemic vulnerability or weakness. Necessity and Justification: Some argue that the U.S. already has efficient digital payment systems (like credit cards, apps, etc.) and that the stated benefits of a CBDC do not outweigh the significant costs and risks. Pursuing a CBDC without a clear, compelling need could be seen as an unnecessary and potentially destabilizing endeavor, perhaps indicative of a weak rationale. These points highlight that the “sign of weakness” comment likely reflects concerns about potential negative impacts on the existing financial structure, individual liberties, market dynamics, or national security, rather than weakness in the technology itself. Comparing the Digital Dollar Debate: Pros vs. Cons The debate around a central bank digital currency in the U.S. is multifaceted, involving a wide range of potential benefits and significant challenges. Here’s a simplified comparison: Potential Benefits (Arguments For) Potential Challenges (Arguments Against) Faster & Cheaper Payments Privacy Concerns & Surveillance Risk Increased Financial Inclusion Cybersecurity & Systemic Risk Enhanced Monetary Policy Tools Disruption to Commercial Banking International Competitiveness Implementation Costs & Complexity Potential for Innovation Stifling Private Sector Innovation The statement from the US Treasury Secretary clearly aligns more with the “Challenges” column, emphasizing potential downsides over perceived benefits. What Does This Mean for the Future of a US CBDC? The opinion of the US Treasury Secretary carries significant weight within the executive branch and influences policy discussions. While the Federal Reserve operates independently, its decisions on something as monumental as issuing a Federal Reserve digital currency would undoubtedly involve extensive consultation and consideration of views from across the government, including the Treasury. This public stance suggests a high-level resistance within the current administration towards the concept of a digital dollar . It doesn’t necessarily kill the idea entirely, as research and debate will likely continue, but it certainly places a significant political hurdle in its path. It signals that any proposal for a US CBDC would face strong opposition from at least one key financial leader. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and those following the evolution of digital finance, this development is crucial. It underscores the complex political and economic considerations at play beyond just the technological feasibility of a central bank digital currency . It also highlights that the U.S. approach to digital money may continue to favor private sector innovation (like stablecoins) over a direct government-issued alternative, at least for now. Actionable Insights: What Should You Watch For? Given this development, here are a few things to keep an eye on: Further Statements: Will other government officials or Federal Reserve governors echo or counter this sentiment? Legislative Action: Will Congress take steps to either prohibit or authorize the exploration/creation of a digital dollar ? Several bills related to this topic have already been introduced. Federal Reserve Research: How will the Fed’s ongoing research and publications reflect or respond to this high-level feedback? Global Developments: Will progress or issues with CBDCs in other countries influence the U.S. debate? Private Sector Innovation: Will the focus shift further towards regulating and integrating private stablecoins as the primary form of digital dollar in the U.S.? The landscape for a US CBDC remains uncertain, but this recent statement provides a strong indication of the challenges it faces at the highest levels of government. Compelling Summary: The Digital Dollar Debate Takes a Negative Turn In summary, the reported statement from the US Treasury Secretary , rejecting the notion of a Federal Reserve digital currency and labeling it a “sign of weakness,” marks a significant moment in the ongoing debate. It introduces a powerful voice of opposition from within the executive branch, adding complexity to the Federal Reserve’s exploration of a central bank digital currency . While the potential benefits of a digital dollar are discussed, concerns surrounding privacy, financial stability, and market impact appear to be weighing heavily on some key decision-makers. This development suggests that the path towards a US CBDC is likely to be challenging and highlights the deep divisions that exist regarding the role of government in the future of digital money.

Despite ongoing market fluctuations, the cryptocurrency continues to hold key levels, maintaining a bullish path toward the $5 target. Elliott Wave Maps Out XRP Price Path To $5 XForceGlobal, a Certified Elliott Wave analyst, recently shared a medium-timeframe Elliott Wave analysis of XRP, focusing on its price action and wave structure. According to the analyst, XRP remains on a bullish path, indicating a strong potential for upward movement toward the $5.4 target. Related Reading: XRP Price Breaks Above ‘Magic Line’ With Bullish Continuation Toward $3 The price chart shows that XRP is in the final stages of a complex corrective pattern and is poised to enter a powerful third-wave rally. The current wave structure indicates that XRP is forming a “1-2 scenario,” with the next Wave 3 expected to launch its price significantly higher. XForceGlobal has outlined a Fibonacci Retracement zone between the $2.00 and $1.80 range as a potential entry point, with price action showing resilience near this area. The critical price level to watch for XRP is the regional low at $1.60, which acts as the most important support level that would determine the cryptocurrency’s next move. This support level is because if XRP’s price remains above it, its projected bullish scenario and current structure remain intact. On the other hand, if the price drops below it, the trend could shift bearish, potentially invalidating the bullish outlook. With $1.60 acting as a strong support foundation, XForceGlobal projects that XRP could soon surge past $3.20 and potentially reach $5.40 in the coming months. This would mark a new all-time high for XRP, representing a 40.63% increase from its current ATH of $3.84. $2.18 Flagged As Key Breakout Level For The Altcoin Sharing a similar bullish forecast, Bitcoin Benny, a crypto analyst, has shared a technical analysis of XRP on the 1-hour time frame to map out its likely price trajectory. According to the analyst, XRP is showing signs of recovery after enduring a sharp market correction in late April. Related Reading: XRP Price Pullback To $2 According To Plan For Historic Breakout To $10, Analyst Says The cryptocurrency had made a significant high of around $2.3 but underwent a dramatic drop, reportedly bottoming out at approximately $2.125, where buyers quickly stepped in to stabilize its price. This support level has since held strong, with the XRP price currently consolidating just below this point. Marked on the right side of the chart, the analyst has pinpointed a key resistance level at $2.18, labeling this level as a critical breakout point. Suppose the altcoin can decisively break and close above $2.18. In that case, Bitcoin Benny predicts that it could trigger what he calls a “send season,” which is a momentum-driven rally that could push XRP toward new levels to potentially retest its previous highs.

In a new interview with the host of the Crypto Banter YouTube channel Ran Neuner, Hayes says central banks will likely boost money printing to address worsening macroeconomic conditions that could push Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other crypto assets to much higher valuations. “I think that the setup is just perfect for a rally in risk assets, just like we saw from the third quarter of 2022 until early 2025. There’s a similar setup today. We have a lot of fear, uncertainty, doubt in the markets, and the monetary authorities, especially in America, cannot handle that, so they’re going to resort to money printing… This is all about the Treasury. [Former US Treasury Secretary] Janet Yellen printed $2.5 trillion from 2022 to 2025. Bitcoin went up 6x. [US Treasury Secretary Scott] Bessent has to do something similar. And so that’s why April 9th was the bottom, and we’re going to go much higher from here.” Hayes also predicts that the Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) metric may soon enter a downward phase after tagging the 70% level, setting alts up to outperform the flagship crypto asset. BTC.D calculates how much of the crypto market cap belongs to BTC. Bitcoin dominance currently stands at 64.81%. “I think Bitcoin dominance goes to 70%-ish. Bitcoin goes to the $150,000 level, something around there. And then we start to get the rotation into altcoins.” Bitcoin is trading for $94,030 at time of writing, down 1.8% in the last 24 hours.

44254871,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157763,1746576053,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Benchmark Initiates ‘Buy’ on Canaan, Citing Tremendous Undervaluation and Bitcoin Upside",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/canaan-benchmark-buy-rating/,"Exciting news for investors keeping an eye on the digital asset space! U.S. investment bank Benchmark has recently cast a spotlight on Nasdaq-listed Canaan , a prominent player in the Bitcoin miner sector. This move comes with a significant vote of confidence: an initiated coverage coupled with a ‘Buy’ rating and a $3 price target. Why is Benchmark Bullish on This Bitcoin Miner? Benchmark’s positive outlook on Canaan isn’t just a random pick; it’s rooted in several key aspects of the company’s operations and market position. According to reports, the firm highlighted Canaan’s distinct advantages, particularly its vertically integrated business model. This means Canaan doesn’t just mine Bitcoin; it also designs and produces the very hardware (mining machines) needed for the process. This dual capability is seen as a significant strength, offering control over the supply chain and potentially better cost management. Beyond hardware, Benchmark also pointed to Canaan’s growing self-mining operations. By using its own machines to mine Bitcoin, the company directly benefits from the network’s rewards. Furthermore, Canaan holds a notable amount of Bitcoin on its balance sheet. These holdings act as a direct lever to rising Bitcoin prices, offering additional upside potential for the company’s value. In summary, Benchmark sees these factors as key value drivers: Vertically Integrated Model: Control over hardware production and self-mining. Growing Self-Mining: Direct participation in Bitcoin mining rewards. Strong Bitcoin Holdings: Asset exposure to Bitcoin price increases. Is CAN Stock Truly Undervalued? Despite the positive fundamentals identified by Benchmark, CAN stock has experienced declines recently. However, Benchmark views this downturn as an opportunity, asserting that Canaan is significantly undervalued when compared to its peers in the Bitcoin mining and hardware manufacturing space. This valuation gap suggests that the market might not be fully appreciating Canaan’s underlying assets and business model strengths. The $3 price target set by Benchmark implies a substantial potential upside from the stock’s current trading levels, aligning with their assessment of undervaluation. For those considering cryptocurrency investment , this analysis provides a specific company to research further, especially if they believe in the long-term trajectory of Bitcoin and the infrastructure supporting it. What Does This Mean for Investors? Benchmark’s initiation of coverage with a ‘Buy’ rating is a notable event for Canaan and potential investors. It signals that a major investment bank sees significant potential in the company. While analyst ratings are just one piece of the puzzle, they can influence market sentiment and draw attention to stocks that might otherwise be overlooked. For individuals interested in gaining exposure to the Bitcoin ecosystem through equity, Canaan (CAN) now has a prominent financial institution endorsing its prospects. However, as with all investments, especially in the volatile crypto-adjacent space, potential investors should conduct their own thorough research (due diligence) and consider their own risk tolerance before making any investment decisions. The performance of Bitcoin miners like Canaan remains closely tied to the price of Bitcoin itself, which is known for its significant price swings. Conclusion: A Bullish Signal Amidst Volatility Benchmark’s ‘Buy’ rating and $3 price target on Canaan underscore a belief in the company’s core business model and its potential to capitalize on future increases in the price of Bitcoin. By highlighting its vertical integration, self-mining growth, and Bitcoin holdings, Benchmark presents a case for why Canaan might be an undervalued opportunity in the current market. While recent stock performance shows the inherent volatility, the analyst’s view suggests a positive long-term outlook based on fundamental strengths and macro trends in the cryptocurrency market. This initiation of coverage provides a fresh perspective for those exploring opportunities within the Bitcoin mining landscape.

44255821,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=722248,1746577531,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/44255821.jpeg,"Sam Altman’s Worldcoin promised a global ID, so why are countries slamming the door?",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/worldcoin-global-id-promise-sparks-backlash/,"OpenAI co-founder Sam Altman launched Worldcoin in 2023 to give people a digital identity to verify themselves securely and anonymously online. The idea behind the project required people to scan their irises and, in exchange for their personal data, the company would reward them with a small amount of cryptocurrency, which it believed would inspire more people to sign up. Altman expressed his intention for Worldcoin as a “ proof of personhood ” because AI could mimic human behavior and talk like them, making it more difficult to tell who or what is real online. He also wanted to close the gap between the rich and the poor by giving everyone equal access to digital services without paperwork or passwords. In the beginning, Worldcoin was all hype as social media posts showed people waiting in long lines to scan their irises, especially in countries across Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Most of the volunteers were more than happy to be a part of the global tech movement, while others were in it for the free cryptocurrency the company gave everyone who scanned their irises. However, Altman’s vision of a connected and equal world began crumbling as people and governments raised concerns about the project’s privacy, data safety, fairness, and consent. Privacy groups slam Worldcoin over biometric risks and exploitation Tech experts and privacy groups warned that the biometric data from these eye scans is extremely sensitive because the information connects directly to who you are as a person. And since you can’t change your eyes like your password, a hacker could easily stalk or steal from you. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) also criticized the project by saying the company rushed to collect information from third-world countries because the people were unaware of how Worldcoin would use, protect, or delete their data. In addition, people raised concerns about consent because Worldcoin would sometimes target individuals with limited internet access or education since they are less likely to understand the risks and make a more informed decision. Some users even claimed they only registered for Worldcoin for the free cryptocurrency but did not know how the company would use their data. Worldcoin also faced scrutiny over transparency, as it failed to clearly explain how user data was stored, who had access to it, and what would happen if the company changed ownership or shut down. Although Worldcoin claimed to anonymize the data, experts pointed out that it could still be traced back to the individual with the right tools. Once a scan is in the company’s database, it could remain there indefinitely. Due to mounting concerns, various governments launched investigations into Worldcoin’s practices. Nations like Spain, Portugal, and Kenya are at the forefront of demanding Worldcoin cease operations in their regions. These actions prove that many governments globally are moving too fast, breaking several legislative laws that seek to protect user interests. Worldcoin tries to win back trust after bans Due to the government pushback, Worldcoin quickly tried to save its image and respond to the growing criticism by sharing the code behind its Orb scanning device to help people understand how it worked and prove that it wasn’t secretly collecting more data than it claimed. Furthermore, the company introduced “Personal Custody” to allow users to control their data by storing it themselves or deleting it from the database. Moreover, Worldcoin brought in independent experts to perform third-party audits to ascertain that the company’s technology and policies aligned with the regulations the way Worldcoin claimed. Despite these efforts, legal and tech experts still have mixed opinions because some say it was the first step toward making things right, while others claim that these efforts were not enough and that the company still has big problems to solve. Therefore, even after all the changes Worldcoin has made, the gap between what the company claims and what regulators believe remains wide because regulators say the company still needs to explain, fix, and prove more before the uplift bans. The Indonesian Ministry of Communication and Digital (Komdigi) plans to summon the developers of Worldcoin and WorldID next week. This action follows the temporary suspension of the platforms that collect users’ iris data for alleged regulatory violations.

A significant development signaling this trend is the recent move by a global payments giant. If you’re interested in the future of money and how large corporations are embracing digital assets, particularly stablecoin payments , this news is for you. What’s Behind the Visa Ventures Investment? Visa Ventures , the strategic investment arm of Visa, has thrown its weight behind BVNK, a company specializing in providing infrastructure for stablecoin payments. This isn’t just another small funding round; it follows BVNK’s successful $50 million Series B and represents a notable step for Visa. According to reports, the primary goal of this Visa investment is to facilitate BVNK’s expansion into the crucial U.S. stablecoin market . The United States is a massive market with growing interest in digital payments, and stablecoins offer a potential bridge between the volatility of traditional cryptocurrencies and the stability required for everyday transactions. This move suggests Visa sees tangible value in stablecoins as a payment rail, potentially for cross-border transactions, business-to-business payments, or even consumer use cases in the future. It’s a strategic play to get involved early in the infrastructure layer that could power the next generation of digital payments. Why Focus on Stablecoin Payments Now? Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specific asset, most commonly the U.S. dollar. Unlike volatile assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum, their price is pegged (or attempts to be pegged) 1:1 with a fiat currency or basket of assets. This stability makes them attractive for transactions, remittances, and settlements, areas where volatility is a major hindrance for traditional cryptocurrencies. For businesses, accepting or making payments in stablecoins offers several potential advantages: Speed: Transactions can often settle much faster than traditional bank transfers, especially internationally. Cost: Fees can be significantly lower than traditional payment processors or cross-border wire transfers. Accessibility: They operate on blockchain networks, potentially offering greater accessibility to those underserved by traditional banking. 24/7 Operation: Unlike banks, blockchain networks operate around the clock. Companies like BVNK build the necessary infrastructure – APIs, compliance tools, settlement layers – to make these benefits accessible and usable for businesses and financial institutions. What Does This Mean for BVNK ? Receiving an investment from a giant like Visa is a major validation for BVNK. Beyond the capital, it brings: Credibility: Association with a global payments leader enhances trust and reputation. Expertise: Potential access to Visa’s deep understanding of the payments landscape, regulatory environments, and network effects. Network Opportunities: Possibility of future collaborations or integrations with Visa’s vast network of partners and merchants. Accelerated U.S. Entry: The investment is specifically aimed at supporting their expansion into the U.S., a complex but lucrative market. This funding will likely be used to build out their U.S. team, navigate the regulatory landscape, develop localized products, and establish partnerships within the region. Navigating the U.S. Stablecoin Market : Challenges and Opportunities While the opportunity in the U.S. is immense, the path is not without hurdles. The regulatory environment for stablecoins in the United States is still evolving. Lawmakers and regulators are actively debating how to classify and regulate stablecoins, with potential frameworks ranging from treating issuers like banks to creating entirely new regulatory categories. Key considerations for BVNK and other players in the U.S. stablecoin market include: Regulatory Compliance: Adhering to state and federal financial regulations, including KYC/AML requirements. Licensing: Obtaining necessary money transmitter licenses or other required permits. Banking Relationships: Establishing and maintaining relationships with traditional banks for fiat on/off-ramps. Consumer Protection: Ensuring robust systems are in place to protect users. Competition: The market is attracting significant interest, leading to increased competition from both crypto-native firms and traditional finance players. Despite these challenges, the potential rewards are substantial. A clear regulatory framework, once established, could unlock significant institutional and corporate adoption of stablecoin payments , creating a massive market for infrastructure providers like BVNK. Is This the Future of Payments? Visa’s Visa investment in BVNK is a strong signal that major players in traditional finance see stablecoins not just as a niche crypto product, but as a potential component of the future global payment system. It reflects a broader trend of convergence, where the efficiency and innovation of blockchain technology are being explored for mainstream financial applications. While cash and traditional card payments are not disappearing anytime soon, the infrastructure being built today by companies like BVNK , with support from entities like Visa Ventures , is laying the groundwork for a future where digital currencies, particularly stablecoins, play a more prominent role in how businesses and individuals transact. Actionable Insight: Businesses should start exploring the potential benefits and mechanics of stablecoin payments, especially those involved in international trade or looking for faster, cheaper payment options. Understanding the infrastructure providers and the evolving regulatory landscape is crucial. In Conclusion: A Bridge Between Worlds The investment by Visa Ventures in BVNK represents a significant bridge being built between the traditional financial world and the emerging digital asset ecosystem. By backing infrastructure for stablecoin payments , Visa is positioning itself at the forefront of innovation in the payments space, specifically targeting expansion within the critical U.S. stablecoin market . This move validates the growing importance of stablecoins as a practical tool for transactions and highlights the increasing collaboration between established finance and crypto-native companies. As the regulatory picture in the U.S. becomes clearer, expect to see more such strategic partnerships and accelerated development in the stablecoin payment sector.

Artificial intelligence continues to transform how we interact with information. Google is leveraging this power with a significant update to its iOS app: the new ‘Simplify’ feature. This development in Google AI is set to make navigating dense web content much more accessible for iPhone users. What is Google AI Simplify? Google’s new ‘Simplify’ feature, integrated into the Google app for iOS, is designed to tackle the challenge of complex online text head-on. It employs advanced AI models to take complicated paragraphs and rewrite them in a simpler, more digestible format, all without requiring you to leave the page you are reading. This means you can encounter technical jargon, intricate explanations, or scientific details and get an instant, clearer version to help you understand the core message. How Does AI Text Simplification Work? The technology powering this feature is rooted in a sophisticated prompt refinement approach developed by Google Research. At its core, the ‘Simplify’ tool utilizes Google’s powerful Gemini AI models. These models are trained to understand the nuances of complex language and effectively paraphrase it. Google’s testing indicates that users who read the simplified text gain a better understanding and retain information more effectively than those reading the original, complex versions. The goal of this AI text simplification is to maintain the accuracy and integrity of the original content while removing unnecessary complexity. Consider this example provided by Google: Original Complex Text Simplified Text (by Google AI) The complex pathology of this condition involves emphysematous destruction of lung parenchyma, diffuse interstitial fibrosis, changes in the composition of lung immune cells, increased production of immunomodulatory factors, and the prominent remodeling of pulmonary vasculature. This complex condition involves damage to the lung tissue from emphysema, a disease that damages the air sacs in the lungs, and widespread scarring of the lung tissue, called fibrosis. The immune cells in the lungs change, and the body makes more immunomodulatory factors, substances that control the immune system. The blood vessels in the lungs also change a lot. As the example shows, the simplified version breaks down medical terms and sentence structures into more common language, making the underlying concepts easier to grasp for a general reader. Google Simplify: Keeping Users in the Ecosystem Google’s introduction of the Google Simplify feature is not just about improving readability; it’s also a strategic move in the competitive AI landscape. By offering a built-in tool for text simplification directly within its app, Google aims to provide users with a convenient solution that prevents them from needing to navigate away to third-party AI tools, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, for assistance with understanding complex content. This helps reinforce the Google app as a central hub for information consumption and processing on iOS devices. Accessing the iOS App Feature Using the ‘Simplify’ feature is straightforward for users on the iOS app feature . When you are viewing a web page within the Google app, you can select any portion of text that you find difficult to understand. Once the text is selected, a ‘Simplify’ icon will appear alongside other options like copy or define. Tapping this icon will generate and display the simplified version of the selected text, allowing you to quickly digest the information and continue reading the original page with enhanced comprehension. Gemini AI Powers the Magic The effectiveness of the ‘Simplify’ feature is largely thanks to the capabilities of Gemini AI . Google has emphasized that their goal with this tool is not just to shorten text, but to accurately paraphrase complex ideas. This process must be done without introducing errors or omitting crucial details. The rewritten text must genuinely assist the reader in understanding challenging material while preserving the original information’s integrity. This commitment to accuracy is vital for a tool designed to help users learn and comprehend new topics encountered online. The ‘Simplify’ feature is currently rolling out to iOS users this week, bringing a powerful new capability to the Google app. In conclusion, Google’s new ‘Simplify’ feature, powered by Gemini AI, represents a significant step in making web content more accessible. By providing an easy-to-use tool for AI text simplification directly within its iOS app feature , Google helps users quickly understand complex information and reinforces its ecosystem as a go-to resource for navigating the digital world.

44256782,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157777,1746579605,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Bitcoin OP_RETURN Debate: Developers Propose Radical Change,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-opreturn-limit-debate/,"The world of Bitcoin is rarely quiet, and a recent proposal from Bitcoin Core developers has ignited a significant discussion, bordering on a full-blown crypto debate . At the heart of the matter is a technical tweak with potentially broad implications for how data is stored on the blockchain: the humble Bitcoin OP_RETURN output. What is Bitcoin OP_RETURN and Why Does it Matter? First off, let’s break down what we’re talking about. In simple terms, an OP_RETURN output is a special type of transaction output on the Bitcoin network . Unlike regular outputs that send Bitcoin to a specific address, an OP_RETURN output is provably unspendable. Its primary purpose is to allow a small amount of arbitrary data to be embedded directly into the blockchain, typically for applications built on top of Bitcoin. The key thing here is the data limit. Currently, OP_RETURN outputs are capped at 80 bytes. This limit was introduced years ago precisely to prevent the blockchain from being filled with excessive, non-financial data, which could contribute to something called UTXO bloat . So, why does this seemingly small technical detail matter? Because how data is stored and managed directly impacts the efficiency, cost, and decentralization of the entire Bitcoin network . Changes here are a big deal. Bitcoin Developers’ Proposal: Lifting the Cap A group of prominent Bitcoin developers , specifically from the Bitcoin Core project, have put forward a proposal to remove the existing 80-byte size limit on OP_RETURN outputs entirely. Their argument is based on a technical observation: the current limit isn’t actually achieving its goal effectively and, in some cases, is making things worse. Here’s their reasoning: Workarounds Exist: The 80-byte limit doesn’t stop people from embedding more data. Developers and users find workarounds, often by using multiple OP_RETURN outputs or other, less efficient scripting methods. Worse for UTXO Bloat: These workarounds, particularly using multiple outputs, can actually be *more* harmful to the UTXO bloat problem than allowing a single, larger OP_RETURN output. Each additional output adds entries to the UTXO set, which full nodes need to track. Simplifying Rules: Removing the arbitrary limit simplifies the protocol rules, making the code cleaner and easier to maintain. In essence, the developers argue that the current limit is an ineffective dam that forces water (data) to flow around it in ways that cause more erosion ( UTXO bloat ) downstream. Removing the dam, they suggest, could lead to a more controlled and less harmful flow. The Crypto Debate Ignites: Concerns Over Spam and Consensus As you might expect in the often-passionate world of cryptocurrency, this proposal hasn’t been met with universal acclaim. It has sparked a significant crypto debate , pitting technical efficiency arguments against concerns about network use and governance. Prominent critics have voiced their opposition. Among them are figures like Samson Mow, CEO of JAN3, and Marty Bent from Ten31 Fund and the popular ‘Tales from the Crypt’ podcast. Their core arguments often revolve around: Lack of Consensus: Critics argue that such a fundamental change to how data is handled on the blockchain requires broader community consensus than currently exists for this proposal. Bitcoin development traditionally moves slowly and cautiously, prioritizing agreement across different stakeholder groups. Increased Spam Risk: The fear is that removing the limit could open the floodgates for large amounts of arbitrary, non-financial data being permanently etched onto the Bitcoin network . This could include anything from large text files to encoded images, potentially overwhelming nodes and increasing operational costs. Impact on Node Operators: Full nodes are the backbone of the Bitcoin network . Storing and validating the entire blockchain requires resources. Critics worry that increased data embedding could significantly raise these requirements, potentially pushing smaller node operators offline and leading to centralization. Changing Bitcoin’s Purpose: Some purists believe Bitcoin’s blockchain should be used *only* for financial transactions. Allowing larger data embeds, they argue, deviates from this core purpose and could set a precedent for further non-monetary use cases that compete for block space and resources. This isn’t just a technical disagreement; it touches upon philosophical questions about what the Bitcoin network is for and how its scarce resources (block space and node capacity) should be used. Benefits vs. Challenges: Weighing the Impact Let’s try to summarize the potential upsides and downsides of removing the Bitcoin OP_RETURN limit: Potential Benefits (According to Proponents): Reduced overall UTXO bloat by eliminating less efficient workarounds. Simplification of Bitcoin protocol rules and code. Potentially more efficient ways for developers to embed small amounts of necessary data for layered protocols (though this is debated). Potential Challenges (According to Critics): Increased potential for blockchain ‘spam’ or non-financial data. Higher resource requirements for running a full node on the Bitcoin network . Lack of broad community consensus for the change. Concerns about altering Bitcoin’s fundamental nature. The debate highlights a classic tension in decentralized systems: how to balance flexibility and innovation with stability and resistance to abuse. The Bitcoin developers proposing the change see it as a technical optimization to fix an existing problem, while critics see it as potentially introducing new, worse problems and bypassing established consensus-building processes. UTXO Bloat: Why is it Such a Big Deal? Let’s zoom in on UTXO bloat , as it’s central to the developers’ argument. The UTXO set (Unspent Transaction Output set) is essentially the list of all Bitcoin that currently exists and is available to be spent. Every full node on the Bitcoin network needs to keep track of this set to validate new transactions. When you receive Bitcoin, it’s added to the UTXO set as an output you can spend. When you spend it, that output is marked as spent, and new outputs are created for the recipient and any change. A large UTXO set requires more memory and processing power for nodes. If the set grows too large, it can make it harder and more expensive to run a full node, potentially leading to fewer nodes and thus less decentralization. The 80-byte OP_RETURN limit was intended to keep outputs small and unspendable, thus not contributing to the *spendable* UTXO set directly, but the *number* of outputs still matters. The developers’ point is that workarounds to the 80-byte limit often involve creating *more* outputs (even if some are OP_RETURN or other types), which increases the *size* and *complexity* of the UTXO set data that nodes must manage, arguably causing worse bloat than a single larger OP_RETURN output might. What Happens Next in This Crypto Debate? For now, this is just a proposal from a group of Bitcoin developers . As The Block reported, no release date has been set for any software update that would include this change. The nature of Bitcoin development is iterative and relies heavily on discussion, review, and eventual consensus among a distributed group of developers, users, miners, and businesses. This crypto debate will likely continue to play out on mailing lists, in online forums, and during developer calls. The technical merits of the proposal will be scrutinized, the potential risks debated, and the community’s sentiment gauged. It’s a prime example of how changes, even seemingly minor ones, in a decentralized system like the Bitcoin network require careful consideration and broad buy-in. Summary: A Technical Tweak Sparks Fundamental Questions The proposal by Bitcoin developers to remove the 80-byte limit on Bitcoin OP_RETURN outputs is more than just a technical detail; it’s a catalyst for a broader crypto debate about the future use and health of the Bitcoin network . While proponents argue it’s a necessary step to combat inefficient workarounds and reduce UTXO bloat , critics raise valid concerns about potential spam, increased node costs, and the very nature of Bitcoin’s purpose. This discussion underscores the decentralized and often contentious nature of Bitcoin development. Reaching consensus on significant changes is a slow, deliberate process, reflecting the network’s resistance to rapid alteration. How this debate evolves will be crucial to watch, as it could influence how data is managed on the blockchain for years to come.

Pro-XRP Lawyer Says Not Yet,https://coinpedia.org/news/pro-xrp-lawyer-says-ripple-lawsuit-is-not-over-yet/,"The post Is the Ripple SEC Lawsuit Over? Pro-XRP Lawyer Says Not Yet appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was one of the longest and most talked-about crypto cases in recent years. In April 2024, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said the SEC had agreed to drop the case — just like it had done with other crypto companies. However, unlike those other cases, the SEC has not officially confirmed that it is ending the Ripple lawsuit. Even so, many in the XRP community are already celebrating, thinking the case is over. But a pro-XRP lawyer warned that it’s not finished yet. He explained that some legal steps still need to happen in court before it’s truly done. It is not over yet. Things need to happen first in court https://t.co/Met98eKcc1 — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) May 7, 2025 Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, spoke out recently, asking why the SEC brought the case in the first place. He said the SEC has now dropped every crypto case in the U.S., including its appeal against Ripple. Alderoty explained that the SEC admitted it couldn’t take legal action without first clearly explaining the rules around crypto. Since there were no clear laws for crypto in the U.S., the SEC’s cases didn’t hold up. Now, Ripple wants to move forward — focusing on business, working with Congress, and helping create fair rules for crypto. Their goal is to protect consumers, keep out bad actors, and support innovation in the industry. In other news, Ripple has announced that it will stop publishing its regular quarterly reports on XRP. The company said it made this decision because the SEC used Ripple’s transparency efforts against it during their legal battle. In its Q1 2025 market report, Ripple explained that it started the reports to be open about its XRP holdings and to share information that few other crypto companies were offering. However, Ripple now says those efforts didn’t work as planned and were actually turned against them — especially by former SEC leaders.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-07 01:09:08

The launch of a new web platform by Particle AI , a company known for its innovative AI news reader , marks a significant step in how consumers access and understand digital news . This move aims to broaden access to its AI-enhanced news experience beyond its mobile app. Exploring Particle’s New Web Platform for AI News Particle has officially rolled out its web presence at Particle.news. This expansion brings the core features of its mobile application to a wider audience, offering a fresh perspective on consuming AI news . The platform aggregates headlines and provides AI-generated summaries from various sources, making it easier to quickly grasp the essence of current events. The website allows users to explore news across numerous categories, including: Technology Sports Entertainment Politics Science Crime Economics Video Games Users can also browse the day’s most popular stories directly from the homepage, ensuring they stay updated on trending topics. How Particle AI Enhances Digital News Consumption Particle’s approach goes beyond simple summaries. The platform is designed with specific AI tools to improve reader comprehension. Instead of just bullet points, Particle extracts key quotes from articles, providing direct insights from the source material. While the web version currently displays user questions and answers from the mobile app, direct AI interaction via a chatbot is planned for the future. A standout feature is the integration of ‘entity pages’. When a significant person, product, or organization is mentioned, users can click on the highlighted term to access a dedicated page. These pages provide foundational information, often sourced from Wikipedia, and crucially, link to additional stories about the subject. This creates a richer context for the news being read. Particle’s Approach to AI Publishing and Supporting Sources A critical distinction for Particle is its stated goal to support publishers, not just use their content without attribution. The platform prominently displays links to the original news outlets alongside its AI summaries. Early data from the mobile app showed readers were indeed clicking through to the publishers’ sites. This led Particle to establish partnerships with major news organizations like Reuters, Fortune, and AFP to give their links greater visibility. On the new website, related reporting links are also included at the bottom of summaries, encouraging users to explore the source material further. Sharing a link from the Particle mobile app now directs recipients to the corresponding page on the website, making the content accessible even to those without the app installed. This model presents an interesting angle in the evolving landscape of AI publishing , aiming for a symbiotic relationship rather than pure content aggregation. The Team and Funding Behind Particle AI Particle was co-founded in 2023 by Sara Beykpour, a former senior director of product management at Twitter, and Marcel Molina, a former senior engineer at Twitter and Tesla. The company has secured substantial backing, including $4.4 million in seed funding and a $10.9 million Series A round led by Lightspeed. This significant investment underscores confidence in their vision for an AI news reader that benefits both consumers and publishers. Particle in the Competitive Digital News Landscape Particle enters a space where several players are exploring the use of AI in news. Yahoo, for instance, acquired the Artifact app (created by Instagram’s co-founders) to enhance its News app with AI features. Other major news organizations like Bloomberg, Gannett, and The Wall Street Journal are also experimenting with AI for article summaries. However, Particle’s position as an independent platform specifically focused on AI summaries and Q&A might give it a different standing with readers. Users may be more accepting of AI-generated summaries and insights on a dedicated platform like Particle compared to seeing AI errors directly on the website of a trusted news source reporting original journalism. Benefits and Future Outlook The launch of the web platform is expected to significantly increase Particle’s reach, offering a new way for people to engage with digital news using AI. For readers, the benefits include quicker comprehension through summaries and quotes, deeper context via entity pages, and the ability to ask questions (though direct web interaction is future). For publishers, the potential for referral traffic through prominent linking offers a different model than pure aggregation. As AI continues to evolve, its role in how we consume information will only grow. Particle’s expansion to the web positions it as a notable player exploring how AI can enhance understanding and potentially create a more sustainable ecosystem for news dissemination.

With price back under the point of control, traders are watching closely for signs of a deeper move or a trap. Ethereum’s ( ETH ) price action has stalled at a technically significant region, the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level, drawn from the most recent pivot high to low. This area is also reinforced by daily horizontal resistance and a descending VWAP, adding to its weight as a decision zone. After several failed attempts to push higher, ETH has now begun to roll over, trading back under the point of control (POC) of the local range. Key technical points Major Resistance Cluster: The 0.618 Fibonacci aligns with daily resistance and a descending VWAP, forming a strong technical ceiling. Loss of POC: Price has fallen below the volume point of control, indicating sellers are gaining control of the short-term auction. Bearish Structure Building: Lower highs and a stalled breakout raise the probability of a move toward the next key support near $1,540. ETHUSDT Chart (4), Source: TradingView Detailed analysis After an impulsive move higher, Ethereum’s price has spent several sessions consolidating below a heavy resistance zone. The 0.618 Fibonacci level, a widely watched retracement marker, is reinforced by daily horizontal resistance and a declining VWAP drawn from the last major high. This confluence attracted notable selling pressure, and ETH has now failed multiple times to break above. What adds further caution to the current structure is the recent loss of the point of control within this region. Price has now dipped below the highest-volume node of the recent range, suggesting that the market is no longer accepting value at these levels. This often precedes range rotation or continuation in the direction of the rejection, in this case, to the downside. You might also like: Bitcoin consolidates below key resistance as lower timeframe trend develops The technical landscape also reveals a clear short-term bearish structure forming. ETH has been unable to print higher highs or maintain higher lows, increasing the probability of a broader correction. The next logical support level sits around $1,540, not only a structural level from previous sessions but also a zone with visible price inefficiencies (e.g., unfilled fair value gaps and single prints) that could act as magnets for price. This setup opens the door for a potential 10% downside move from current levels, especially if the recent swing low fails to hold. Still, traders should remain alert to the possibility of a fakeout, as Ethereum has previously shown sudden strength from similar rejection zones. What to expect in the coming price action Ethereum’s failure to break out above the 0.618 confluence zone and its rejection from the POC suggest a higher chance of rotation toward lower supports. If price breaks below the recent swing low, the $1,540 region could be the next target. However, if buyers can defend current levels and reclaim the POC, this might prove to be a local fakeout before resuming upward. For now, caution is warranted as price hovers near a decisive level.

44257380,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157778,1746580858,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Meme Coin Regulation: Explosive Bill Targets Trump’s Political Crypto,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/murphy-trump-meme-coin/,"The intersection of politics and cryptocurrency is becoming increasingly complex, and a recent move by a U.S. Senator highlights the growing concerns around potential conflicts of interest. The emergence of assets like the Trump Meme Coin has sparked debate, leading one lawmaker to take direct action aimed at curbing what he sees as blatant self-dealing in the digital asset space. This development signals a significant moment in the ongoing discussion around Meme Coin Regulation and the broader landscape of US Crypto Regulation . Senator Chris Murphy Takes Aim at Political Crypto U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) has stepped into the spotlight with a legislative proposal designed to prevent U.S. officials from leveraging their positions for personal financial gain through investments like cryptocurrencies and securities. According to reports, Senator Murphy has introduced the “MEME Act,” a bill specifically crafted to address concerns around self-dealing. The acronym ‘MEME’ itself is a pointed reference, clearly indicating the types of assets drawing legislative scrutiny. Senator Murphy’s motivation appears to be directly linked to prominent examples of politicians engaging with digital assets that may benefit them financially. He explicitly cited the promotion of the Trump Meme Coin as a prime example of the kind of behavior his bill aims to prohibit. This move underscores a growing sentiment among some lawmakers that the burgeoning world of Political Crypto requires clear ethical boundaries. The core of the MEME Act, as described, is to ban U.S. officials – a category that includes the President and other high-ranking government figures – from promoting financial instruments in which they have a personal stake. This isn’t just about cryptocurrencies; it extends to traditional securities as well. However, the bill’s name and the context in which it’s being introduced clearly place meme coins and the crypto market at the forefront of this legislative effort. What is the MEME Act and Why Now? The proposed MEME Act seeks to establish a clear legal barrier preventing government officials from using their platform or influence to boost the value of assets they own. While existing ethics rules address conflicts of interest, Senator Murphy’s bill suggests these rules may not be sufficient or explicit enough when it comes to newer asset classes like cryptocurrencies, particularly those with direct ties to political figures. Key aspects of the MEME Act likely include: Defining “U.S. Officials”: Clarifying who is covered by the ban, likely including elected officials, appointed officials, and potentially their immediate families. Defining “Promoting”: Establishing what constitutes promotion of a financial interest. This could range from explicit endorsements to more subtle mentions or actions that could influence market perception. Scope of Assets: Explicitly including cryptocurrencies (with a potential focus on meme coins or politically-themed tokens) alongside traditional securities. Enforcement Mechanisms: Outlining how the ban would be enforced and what penalties officials might face for violations. The timing of this bill is crucial. It comes as discussions around comprehensive US Crypto Regulation are intensifying on Capitol Hill. Lawmakers are grappling with how to oversee the crypto market, protect investors, and prevent illicit activity. Against this backdrop, the high-profile nature of assets like the Trump Meme Coin and the public figures associated with them has seemingly accelerated calls for specific rules addressing potential ethical breaches. The Trump Meme Coin Controversy The specific mention of the Trump Meme Coin by Senator Chris Murphy highlights a particular flashpoint in the political crypto space. While many meme coins are based on internet jokes or cultural trends, a subset has emerged directly tied to political figures or movements. These tokens often gain value based on speculation, community hype, and their connection to the personality they represent. The controversy arises when the individual associated with the coin is also a public official or a candidate for office. Critics argue that any action or statement by that individual that could be perceived as positive towards the crypto market, or even just increasing their overall public profile, could inadvertently (or intentionally) benefit the value of a token tied to them. This creates a potential conflict of interest, where an official’s public duties or political activities could be influenced by their personal financial holdings or those of their associates. Senator Murphy’s characterization of the promotion of such coins as “blatant corruption” reflects the strong negative sentiment some feel towards this phenomenon. It raises questions about the ethics of officials holding or appearing to endorse assets whose value is so directly linked to their own political fortunes or public statements. Is Political Crypto Inherently Problematic? The rise of Political Crypto raises complex questions. On one hand, digital assets can be seen as another form of investment, and individuals, including politicians, have the right to invest. On the other hand, the unique nature of meme coins and politically themed tokens, combined with the power and influence wielded by public officials, creates a potential for abuse that may exceed that of traditional investments. Arguments against officials holding or promoting such assets include: Conflict of Interest: Decisions or statements made in their official capacity could impact the value of their holdings. Market Manipulation Risk: A public figure’s endorsement could cause significant, speculative price swings that harm uninformed investors. Erosion of Public Trust: It can create the perception that officials are prioritizing personal wealth over public service. Unfair Advantage: Officials may have access to information or influence that gives them an edge in the market. However, defining the line can be tricky. Does attending a crypto conference constitute promotion? What about simply owning crypto assets? The MEME Act aims to draw a clearer line, focusing specifically on active “promotion” of assets where the official has a personal financial interest. Navigating the Challenges of Meme Coin Regulation Regulating meme coins presents unique challenges compared to more traditional financial assets or even cryptocurrencies with clear utility. Their value is often driven by intangible factors like community sentiment, social media trends, and celebrity endorsements rather than underlying technology or business models. Key challenges for Meme Coin Regulation include: Defining a Meme Coin: How do you legally define a meme coin distinct from other cryptocurrencies or securities? Volatility: Their extreme price swings make them high-risk, potentially leading to significant losses for investors, but also making them attractive targets for pump-and-dump schemes. Decentralization vs. Centralization: While some crypto projects are genuinely decentralized, others have central figures or teams, making it easier to identify responsible parties for regulation. Meme coins often blur this line. Global Nature: Crypto markets are global, making enforcement of national regulations complex. Despite these challenges, the push for regulation, exemplified by Senator Chris Murphy ‘s MEME Act, indicates a growing resolve among some policymakers to bring more oversight to this corner of the market, especially when it intersects with political figures. Broader Implications for US Crypto Regulation The MEME Act, while focused on official conduct and specific assets like the Trump Meme Coin , is part of a larger legislative trend concerning US Crypto Regulation . Congress and various regulatory bodies are actively debating and proposing rules covering a wide range of crypto activities, including exchanges, stablecoins, NFTs, and decentralized finance (DeFi). This bill could potentially set a precedent for how officials’ interactions with the crypto market are viewed and regulated. It signals that lawmakers are paying close attention not just to the technology itself, but to the ethical implications of its adoption and promotion, particularly by those in positions of power. The debate around this bill will likely touch upon fundamental issues like free speech, the definition of a security, and the appropriate scope of government oversight in rapidly evolving markets. As lawmakers advance digital asset regulations, the focus on preventing self-dealing and maintaining public trust is becoming increasingly prominent. What Does This Mean for Investors and the Public? For investors in meme coins or other cryptocurrencies, this legislative action highlights the inherent risks, including regulatory uncertainty. It underscores that assets tied to personalities or fleeting trends are subject to unique pressures, including political scrutiny. For the public, the MEME Act is presented as a measure to safeguard against corruption and ensure that officials are acting in the public interest, not their personal financial interest. It’s a reminder that as new technologies emerge, the ethical frameworks governing public service must adapt. Actionable insights from this development: Stay Informed: Keep track of legislative developments like the MEME Act and other proposed US Crypto Regulation . Understand Risks: Be aware that meme coins and political tokens carry significant risks, including volatility and potential regulatory action. Demand Transparency: Support calls for greater transparency regarding the financial holdings and potential conflicts of interest of public officials. Engage in the Debate: Understand the arguments for and against stricter Meme Coin Regulation and make your voice heard if possible. Conclusion: A Crucial Step in Defining Ethical Boundaries? Senator Chris Murphy ‘s introduction of the MEME Act represents a pointed effort to address perceived ethical lapses at the intersection of politics and the digital asset market. By specifically targeting the promotion of personal financial interests through assets like the Trump Meme Coin , the bill aims to draw a clear line against self-dealing by U.S. officials. While the path to becoming law is uncertain and the bill is likely to face debate and potential challenges, its introduction is a significant development. It brings the controversial world of Political Crypto into sharp legislative focus and highlights the growing urgency felt by some lawmakers to establish clear ethical boundaries within the broader framework of US Crypto Regulation . The outcome of this legislative effort could have lasting implications for how public officials interact with digital assets and for the future of Meme Coin Regulation itself.

Richard Blumenthal, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations within the Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs, sent letters on Tuesday to Bill Zanker of Fight Fight Fight LLC and Zach Witkoff, co-founder of World Liberty Financial. Senate panel investigates Trump-affiliated crypto ventures for potential conflicts of interest These letters contained inquiries about the ownership and investment structure of several Trump-affiliated entities, including Fight Fight Fight LLC (the company behind the TRUMP meme coin), CIC Digital LLC (which issued Trump’s NFTs and co-owns Fight Fight Fight), Celebration Cards LLC (another Trump-affiliated NFT entity), DTTM Operations LLC (which manages Trump’s intellectual property), as well as World Liberty Financial and its affiliates. According to the letters, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations is conducting a preliminary inquiry into potential conflicts of interest and legal violations involving President Trump’s cryptocurrency ventures and the financial dealings of associated businesses with foreign nationals, foreign governments, and other cryptocurrency firms. One letter referenced World Liberty Financial, while the other pointed to the $TRUMP meme coin. The letters suggested that these businesses “may be enabling the violation of government ethics requirements” and posed several questions for the companies’ executives. These included inquiries on how the companies block investments from foreign governments, their revenue generation, and whether individuals facing prosecution or investigations can participate. Additionally, the letters requested records linked to the Trump-affiliated crypto businesses. Democrats push back as Trump’s crypto dealings trigger legislative resistance As Democrats are currently in the minority in the Senate, Blumenthal lacks subpoena power unless his Republican counterpart, Sen. Ron Johnson, agrees to support the effort. A spokesperson for Johnson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Democrats have sounded the alarm over Trump’s crypto businesses in recent days. Earlie r Tu esday, Rep. Maxine Waters, who leads her party on the House Financial Services Committee, objected to a joint hearing with the House Agriculture Committee to address market structure legislation and instead hosted her own hearing focused on these crypto tie-ups. A weekend statement from Sen. Ruben Gallego and several other Democrats, indicating they would not support the Senate’s stablecoin bill, also appears to be linked to Trump’s crypto activities. In particular, Eric Trump’s announcement that the Abu Dhabi-based investment firm MGX would use the Trump-affiliated USD1 stablecoin to close a $2 billion investment into Binance has raised concerns. Additionally, Sen. Chris Murphy introduced a bill on Tuesday to ban the U.S. president and other senior government officials from issuing meme coins or other financial assets. Trump’s expanding crypto ventures raise concerns over transparency and foreign influence Donald Trump, who had previously criticized cryptocurrencies during his time as President, has since embraced the digital asset space through various ventures. His financial involvement in the crypto world has expanded considerably from the existing sale of Trump-branded NFTs in 2022 to the more recent endorsement of the $TRUMP meme coin project. While the investments appear to be all about brand monetization, the businesses are controversial because they are owned in a non-transparent manner and linked to foreign investors. The Senate’s inquiry centers around several entities linked to Trump’s digital asset activities. These entities collectively represent a network of financial and promotional tools that have drawn scrutiny due to their potential for foreign funding and political implications. At the heart of the investigation is the question of whether these cryptocurrency businesses could enable influence-buying or foreign interference in American politics. Lawmakers fear that without proper oversight, such ventures might violate U.S. ethics laws and potentially allow adversarial entities to gain backdoor access to a future Trump presidency. Government ethics rules prohibit federal officials from profiting off their positions or using their brand in ways that could present conflicts of interest. If Trump’s crypto ventures are found to be accepting investments from foreign actors or enabling individuals facing legal scrutiny to participate, it could lead to significant legal and political fallout.

While it might sound like something out of a futuristic novel, major financial institutions are starting to explore this very possibility. A recent report from investment banking giant Morgan Stanley has ignited fresh debate, suggesting that Bitcoin U.S. reserve asset status might not be as far-fetched as some believe, though significant hurdles remain. What Did the Morgan Stanley Bitcoin Report Reveal? According to insights from The Crypto Basic, the core of the Morgan Stanley Bitcoin report centers on Bitcoin’s sheer size. With a market capitalization hovering around $1.87 trillion (figures can fluctuate), Bitcoin has grown large enough to be considered alongside traditional reserve assets. The report indicates that holding between 12% and 17% of Bitcoin’s total supply could align with conventional standards for national reserves. This isn’t just a theoretical exercise. For an asset to be considered a viable reserve, it typically needs deep liquidity, a significant market size, and a degree of global acceptance. Bitcoin, despite its relatively young age compared to gold or major fiat currencies, is starting to tick some of these boxes, at least in terms of market valuation. However, Morgan Stanley was quick to temper expectations. While the market cap is impressive, the report explicitly highlighted that Bitcoin’s notorious volatility remains a major challenge. Reserve assets are meant to provide stability and confidence, not subject a nation’s wealth to wild price swings. Unpacking the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Proposal The discussion around Bitcoin as a U.S. reserve asset isn’t happening in a vacuum. It’s closely linked to a growing, albeit controversial, movement advocating for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . This proposal, gaining traction among some policymakers, suggests the U.S. should proactively accumulate Bitcoin as a strategic national asset. Proponents argue that such a reserve would: Act as a Hedge: Potentially protect against inflation and the devaluation of fiat currencies. Ensure Future Relevance: Position the U.S. at the forefront of the digital asset revolution. Diversify National Wealth: Offer an alternative to traditional assets that may face different economic pressures. Strengthen National Security: Potentially provide a non-sovereign asset base less susceptible to political pressure tied to fiat systems. This idea, however, faces considerable opposition. Critics raise concerns about the risks involved, the lack of historical precedent for a nation holding such a volatile and decentralized asset, and the potential political fallout from significant losses if the market declines. The Double-Edged Sword: Potential Benefits vs. Bitcoin Volatility Risk Let’s delve deeper into the core tension identified by Morgan Stanley: the potential benefits versus the significant risk. The allure of holding a Bitcoin U.S. reserve asset is clear for its proponents: Diversification: Bitcoin’s price movements have historically shown low correlation with traditional assets like stocks and bonds, offering potential diversification benefits to a national portfolio. Inflation Hedge Narrative: Often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ Bitcoin’s fixed supply (capped at 21 million coins) appeals to those seeking a store of value resistant to inflationary pressures caused by excessive money printing. Potential for Appreciation: While risky, the long-term growth trajectory of Bitcoin offers the possibility of significant returns, potentially increasing national wealth. Embracing the Digital Future: Holding Bitcoin signals a nation’s readiness to engage with the evolving digital economy and potentially participate in future decentralized financial systems. However, these benefits are shadowed by the substantial Bitcoin volatility risk . Unlike gold or stable government bonds, Bitcoin’s price can swing dramatically – 10%, 20%, or even more in a single day. For a national reserve, which is meant to be a bedrock of economic stability and confidence, such volatility is deeply problematic. Imagine the public reaction if a significant portion of the nation’s wealth were to drop by billions or trillions of dollars overnight due to a market correction. This inherent instability is the primary reason why central banks and treasuries have been hesitant to embrace Bitcoin as a core reserve asset, despite growing institutional interest. Beyond Borders: The Global View on Cryptocurrency Reserve While the U.S. debate is prominent, the idea of a Cryptocurrency reserve is being quietly considered in various forms globally. El Salvador famously adopted Bitcoin as legal tender and holds some Bitcoin on its balance sheet, though this is a unique case for a smaller economy and differs from a large-scale reserve strategy for a major power. Other nations are exploring Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) as a digital evolution of their fiat currency, which is a different concept entirely from holding decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin as a reserve. The global landscape shows a mix of curiosity, caution, and outright skepticism towards integrating decentralized cryptocurrencies into national balance sheets. No major developed nation has yet signaled concrete plans to establish a significant Cryptocurrency reserve based on Bitcoin or similar assets, primarily due to the same risks identified by Morgan Stanley – volatility, regulatory clarity, and security. What’s Next? Navigating the Future of Digital Reserves The Morgan Stanley report, coupled with the ongoing debate around a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve , underscores a critical juncture in global finance. It highlights that major financial players are seriously evaluating the potential role of digital assets like Bitcoin at the highest levels. For investors, this ongoing conversation is significant. It suggests continued institutional interest and potential future adoption, which could influence market dynamics. However, it also reinforces the need for caution and a clear understanding of the inherent risks, particularly volatility. For policymakers, the challenge is immense. They must weigh the potential long-term benefits of embracing digital assets against the immediate and significant risks. Key questions revolve around: Developing robust and secure custody solutions for national digital asset holdings. Establishing clear regulatory frameworks. Addressing the energy consumption debate surrounding proof-of-work cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Gaining political and public consensus for such a move. The path forward for a Bitcoin U.S. reserve asset is anything but certain. It involves complex technical, economic, and political considerations. The conversation is evolving rapidly, driven by technological innovation and shifting global economic landscapes. In Conclusion: Morgan Stanley’s assessment that Bitcoin’s market cap makes it large enough to be considered a U.S. reserve asset is a landmark statement, reflecting the maturation of the cryptocurrency market. It validates the scale Bitcoin has achieved. However, the report’s equally strong emphasis on the lingering threat of volatility serves as a crucial reminder of the challenges that must be addressed before Bitcoin could realistically join the ranks of traditional, stability-focused national reserves. The debate over a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve will undoubtedly continue, pushing boundaries and forcing a deeper examination of what constitutes value and security in the digital age.

This isn’t just a technical story; it’s about how a leading AI company structures itself, impacts investors, and navigates intense regulatory scrutiny. The latest update involves a major OpenAI Restructuring plan, moving away from its previous, somewhat unusual setup. This shift has big implications, not least for potential IPO Prospects and how the company balances its mission with commercial goals. Why the Shift in Corporate Structure? OpenAI announced a new corporate structure plan following discussions with attorneys general in Delaware and California. These states have been watching closely as OpenAI sought to change its unique arrangement where a nonprofit board oversees for-profit operations. The core of the new plan is to convert OpenAI’s for-profit entity into a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC). However, this PBC will still remain under the control of OpenAI’s original nonprofit board. This change aims to address concerns from both regulators and investors. Regulators are interested in ensuring AI development benefits humanity, aligning with OpenAI’s stated mission. Investors, who have poured billions into the company, expect a return on their investment. A more conventional Corporate Structure could potentially satisfy both parties, offering greater clarity and potentially simplifying future fundraising efforts. What Does Public Benefit Corporation Mean for OpenAI? A Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) is a type of for-profit entity that is legally required to consider the impact of its decisions not only on shareholders but also on society and the environment. While still focused on profit, a PBC has a broader mission embedded in its charter. In OpenAI’s case, this likely means the PBC will be obligated to consider the benefit of artificial general intelligence for all humanity, echoing the nonprofit’s original charter. Under the proposed structure, the OpenAI nonprofit will control and hold a significant shareholder position in the new PBC. This differs from a previous plan that would have spun the for-profit arm out from under the nonprofit’s direct control. This continued control by the nonprofit, while potentially appeasing some concerns about mission alignment, introduces complexities, particularly regarding asset ownership and decision-making authority. Navigating AI Regulation and Legal Pressure The backdrop to this OpenAI Restructuring is increasing pressure from various fronts, including growing calls for clearer AI Regulation . Attorneys general have been involved, reviewing OpenAI’s plans to ensure they align with legal and charitable obligations. Just recently, former OpenAI employees urged state AGs to block the restructuring, arguing it conflicted with the company’s founding charitable principles. Major investors, including Microsoft and Softbank, are also key stakeholders. Their multi-billion-dollar investments are reportedly contingent on a successful restructuring. Microsoft, OpenAI’s largest partner, is reportedly seeking assurances that its investment is adequately protected under the new Corporate Structure . Approval from these key investors is crucial for the plan’s success. Perhaps the most public pressure comes from Elon Musk, an OpenAI co-founder now competing with the company. Musk has not only filed a lawsuit accusing OpenAI of abandoning its nonprofit mission but also reportedly made a significant takeover bid for the nonprofit assets to complicate the for-profit transition. A recent court decision denying some of OpenAI’s motions in Musk’s lawsuit was seen as a small win for him and may have influenced OpenAI’s change in course, though OpenAI leadership has reportedly denied this connection. Challenges for OpenAI’s IPO Prospects One significant question raised by the new structure is its impact on OpenAI’s IPO Prospects . While the shift to a Public Benefit Corporation makes a public offering theoretically possible (nonprofits cannot go public, but PBCs can), experts highlight potential hurdles. A major challenge is the ownership of core intellectual property (IP). Corporate governance experts like Stephen Diamond note that if the critical AI technology and IP remain at the nonprofit level, merely licensed to the PBC, what exactly would an IPO represent? Shareholders typically invest in a company that owns and controls its primary assets. If the PBC only has a license to the valuable IP held by the nonprofit, the investment proposition becomes less clear and potentially less attractive to public market investors. Furthermore, the continued control by the nonprofit board means shareholders in the PBC would likely have limited influence over major corporate decisions, unlike in a typical public company. This limited shareholder control could make an IPO much more difficult, according to experts like Rose Chan Loui from UCLA’s Law Program on Philanthropy and Nonprofits. While OpenAI states an IPO is theoretically possible under the plan, they currently have no intention of going public, according to a spokesperson. What Does This Mean for the Future? OpenAI’s decision to pursue this new Corporate Structure is a direct response to the complex web of regulatory scrutiny, investor expectations, and internal/external pressures it faces. The move to a Public Benefit Corporation controlled by the nonprofit attempts to bridge the gap between its mission and commercial realities. However, the path forward is not without challenges. The structure’s complexity, particularly regarding IP ownership and shareholder influence, casts a shadow over future IPO Prospects and fundraising efforts. Success hinges on appeasing regulators, securing investor confidence (especially Microsoft’s), and navigating ongoing legal battles, such as the one with Elon Musk. The outcome of this OpenAI Restructuring will be a critical case study in how leading AI companies balance rapid commercialization with ethical considerations and their founding missions, all under the watchful eye of increasing AI Regulation .

According to a report by Watcher Guru, New Hampshire’s governor has officially signed into law a bill that permits the state to invest portions of its general fund and revenue stabilization fund directly into Bitcoin and other digital assets. This move positions New Hampshire at the forefront of US State Crypto adoption, making it the first state to finalize legislation introducing Bitcoin as a reserve asset at the state level. What Does the New Hampshire Bitcoin Law Actually Do? At its core, the newly signed legislation grants the New Hampshire state treasurer the explicit authority to manage investments in digital assets. This isn’t just a theoretical possibility; the law specifically allows for the allocation of funds from two key state accounts: the general fund and the revenue stabilization fund. These funds are crucial for the state’s financial health, covering everything from daily operations to preparing for economic downturns. Here’s a breakdown of the key aspects of this law: Investment Authority: The state treasurer is empowered to invest in Bitcoin and other digital assets. Eligible Funds: Investments can be made using money from the state’s general fund and revenue stabilization fund. Asset Class Expansion: This adds digital assets to the list of approved investment vehicles for state funds, which traditionally include things like bonds, stocks, and other conventional assets. Oversight: While the treasurer has the authority, the management and specific strategies would likely be subject to established state investment protocols and potentially further guidelines. This is a departure from the norm. While some municipalities or public pension funds might have explored indirect exposure or specific blockchain technologies, this is the first instance of a US state directly authorizing investment in Bitcoin as a reserve asset via finalized legislation. Why is This State Bitcoin Investment So Significant? The significance of New Hampshire’s decision cannot be overstated. It represents a tangible step by a US state government to embrace a new and often debated asset class. For years, discussions around Government Bitcoin Adoption have largely been theoretical or focused on national governments (like El Salvador). New Hampshire brings this conversation to the state level within the United States. Consider these points on its significance: First of Its Kind: As the first state with finalized legislation for direct state-level Bitcoin investment, New Hampshire sets a precedent. Legitimacy Boost: A state government treating Bitcoin as a legitimate investment option, even for a portion of its funds, lends credibility to the asset class in the eyes of traditional finance and other governmental bodies. Potential Catalyst: This could encourage other states to explore similar possibilities, leading to a domino effect of State Bitcoin Investment discussions and potential legislation across the country. Reserve Asset Focus: The mention of using funds like the revenue stabilization fund suggests an interest in Bitcoin not just for speculative gain, but potentially as a hedge or alternative store of value, aligning with a Bitcoin Reserve Strategy. This isn’t merely an abstract policy discussion; it’s a concrete legislative action that could influence future financial strategies for public funds. Potential Benefits: Why Would a State Invest in Bitcoin? Investing public funds comes with immense responsibility. New Hampshire’s lawmakers and governor likely weighed the potential benefits against the risks. So, what might be the motivations behind this pioneering New Hampshire Bitcoin Law? Possible benefits include: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin is often touted as a potential hedge against inflation due to its fixed supply. States, like individuals and corporations, are susceptible to the devaluation of fiat currency. Allocating a small percentage to Bitcoin could be seen as a way to preserve purchasing power over the long term. Potential for High Returns: While volatile, Bitcoin has historically offered significant returns over certain periods, outperforming many traditional assets. A prudent, small allocation could potentially boost overall portfolio performance. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset like Bitcoin to a traditional portfolio of stocks and bonds can potentially reduce overall portfolio risk, although Bitcoin’s correlation can change. Attracting Innovation and Talent: By embracing digital assets, New Hampshire might signal that it is a forward-thinking state, potentially attracting blockchain companies, crypto entrepreneurs, and tech talent, boosting its local economy. Exploring Future Financial Technologies: Governments need to understand emerging technologies. Investing in digital assets provides hands-on experience and understanding of this evolving financial landscape. These potential benefits highlight a strategic perspective, looking beyond short-term price movements towards long-term financial health and technological engagement. What Are the Challenges and Risks Involved? No investment is without risk, and digital assets are known for their volatility. The New Hampshire decision is not without its potential downsides and challenges. Key challenges and risks include: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can experience dramatic swings in short periods. This volatility could lead to significant paper losses on the state’s investments, potentially drawing criticism. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the US is still evolving. Changes in federal or state regulations could impact the legality or viability of such investments. Security Risks: Holding digital assets requires robust security measures to prevent hacking, theft, or loss of private keys. State funds would need institutional-grade security protocols. Custody Issues: Securely storing digital assets (custody) is complex. The state treasurer’s office would need to navigate reliable and secure custody solutions. Public Perception: Not all citizens or lawmakers may agree with using public funds for volatile assets like Bitcoin. There could be public relations challenges and political debate. Lack of Precedent: Being the first means there’s no established playbook for a US state managing a Bitcoin reserve. They will be navigating uncharted territory. These risks underscore the need for careful planning, robust risk management, and transparency in how these investments are handled. How Might This Influence Other States? New Hampshire’s pioneering step could very well serve as a case study for other states. Governments often look to their peers for successful models and policy ideas. If New Hampshire’s State Bitcoin Investment proves successful, demonstrating prudent management and potential benefits, it could accelerate discussions elsewhere. States might consider: Forming Study Committees: Legislatures might form committees to study the feasibility and implications of digital asset investments for state funds. Drafting Similar Legislation: Lawmakers in other states might draft bills mirroring New Hampshire’s law, tailoring it to their specific state’s financial structure and legal framework. Exploring Different Digital Assets: While Bitcoin is often the entry point, states might also look into other digital assets or broader blockchain-related investments. Developing Specific Investment Guidelines: States would need to develop clear guidelines on what percentage of funds can be invested, which assets are permissible, and risk management protocols. The US State Crypto landscape is still nascent, but New Hampshire’s action has certainly injected momentum into the conversation. Is This Part of a Broader Government Bitcoin Adoption Trend? While New Hampshire is the first state with this specific law, there have been other instances of government entities interacting with crypto. Cities like Miami have explored initiatives involving crypto, and some public pension funds have gained exposure through investment in companies or funds related to blockchain and digital assets, albeit often indirectly. Globally, El Salvador famously adopted Bitcoin as legal tender, a much more radical step than New Hampshire’s investment strategy. However, New Hampshire’s move is significant because it occurs within the US federal system and involves state-level reserve management. This action by New Hampshire contributes to a growing narrative around Government Bitcoin Adoption, suggesting that even within developed economies, public entities are starting to seriously consider how digital assets fit into traditional financial systems and investment strategies. It moves the conversation from ‘if’ governments will engage with crypto to ‘how’ and ‘when’. Actionable Insights for the Reader What does New Hampshire’s decision mean for you, whether you’re a crypto investor, a taxpayer, or just following the news? Here are some takeaways: Increased Legitimacy: This state-level approval adds another layer of legitimacy to Bitcoin and digital assets, potentially influencing broader public and institutional perception. Watch Other States: Keep an eye on legislative developments in other states. New Hampshire’s move could trigger similar proposals elsewhere. Understand Public Finance: This highlights how public funds are managed and the evolving strategies states might employ to ensure financial stability and growth. Risk Management is Key: The risks faced by a state investing in Bitcoin are similar to those faced by individual investors – volatility, security, regulatory changes. This underscores the importance of robust risk management in any crypto investment. Potential for Infrastructure Growth: Increased government interest could spur the development of more secure and regulated infrastructure for holding and managing digital assets. New Hampshire’s New Hampshire Bitcoin Law isn’t just local news; it has implications for the wider digital asset ecosystem. Conclusion: A Landmark Step Towards a Digital Future? New Hampshire’s decision to allow state investment in Bitcoin and other digital assets is a landmark event in the US. By granting the state treasurer the authority to allocate portions of key state funds into this new asset class, New Hampshire has become the first state to enact finalized legislation supporting a Bitcoin Reserve Strategy at the state level. While potential benefits like inflation hedging, diversification, and attracting innovation are clear, the state must also navigate the significant challenges posed by volatility, security risks, and regulatory uncertainty. This move is a crucial development in the broader trend of Government Bitcoin Adoption and could serve as a blueprint or catalyst for other states considering similar steps. It signals a growing recognition of digital assets within traditional finance and governance structures in the United States.

44258666,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157783,1746583244,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shock: US Crypto Regulation Hearing Collapses Over Donald Trump Crypto Ties,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-crypto-hearing-collapses/,"A highly anticipated joint congressional hearing aimed at tackling the complexities of US crypto regulation recently ended in dramatic fashion, collapsing before it even truly began. This sudden breakdown wasn’t due to a lack of interest in the topic, but rather a deep political rift centered around concerns over former U.S. President Donald Trump crypto connections and the potential for conflicts of interest among officials involved in the digital asset space. Why the House Crypto Hearing Hit a Wall The planned session was intended to bring together lawmakers from different committees to discuss and potentially forge a path forward for comprehensive US crypto regulation . However, according to reports, House Democrats raised significant objections, fundamentally disagreeing with the scope and focus proposed for the joint meeting. Their primary concern? The growing involvement of prominent political figures, including former President Donald Trump crypto activities, in the digital asset market. This fundamental disagreement proved insurmountable, leading to the unprecedented decision to scrap the joint format. Instead of a unified front, lawmakers retreated to their respective corners: Republicans: Proceeded with a separate roundtable discussion focused primarily on the technical and economic aspects of crypto regulation, aiming to understand the technology and potential frameworks for oversight. Democrats: Convened their own meeting, shifting the focus sharply towards ethics, potential corruption risks associated with politicians holding or promoting digital assets, and discussing the possibility of a politician crypto ban . This split starkly illustrates the deep divisions within Congress regarding how to approach the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrencies. It’s not just about technology or finance; it’s increasingly becoming entangled with political ethics and potential conflicts of interest. The Donald Trump Crypto Connection: A Point of Contention The specific mention of Donald Trump crypto ties as a reason for the hearing’s collapse highlights a growing concern among some lawmakers. As a former president and potential future candidate, his engagement with digital assets – including owning crypto and promoting related ventures – raises questions about potential influence and whether his financial interests could impact future policy decisions should he return to office or continue to be a public figure influencing policy debates. Democrats argued that ignoring these potential ethical issues and conflicts of interest would render any regulatory discussion incomplete or even compromised. They believe that establishing clear ethical guidelines, or even implementing a politician crypto ban on trading or profiting from digital assets while in office, is a necessary prerequisite for developing fair and effective US crypto regulation . The Intensifying Crypto Policy Debate This incident underscores how the crypto policy debate in the U.S. is multifaceted and often contentious. While there’s broad agreement that some form of regulation is needed, there’s significant disagreement on: Key Areas of Disagreement in the Crypto Policy Debate: Area Republican Focus (Generally) Democrat Focus (Generally) Primary Goal Fostering innovation, market clarity, investor protection through defined rules. Consumer protection, financial stability, preventing illicit use, addressing ethical concerns. Regulatory Approach Potentially creating new frameworks, assigning clear agency roles (CFTC vs. SEC). Utilizing existing regulations where possible, strong enforcement, potentially new ethics rules. Key Concerns Over-regulation stifling growth, lack of clarity, U.S. competitiveness. Fraud, scams, market manipulation, systemic risk, political conflicts of interest. Ethics Angle Less emphasized in general regulatory discussions. High priority, focus on transparency and potential restrictions for officials. The collapse of the joint House crypto hearing is a clear symptom of this broader political deadlock. When lawmakers can’t even agree on the agenda for discussing US crypto regulation , passing comprehensive legislation becomes an even more daunting challenge. Pushing for a Politician Crypto Ban The Democrats’ decision to hold a separate session specifically focused on proposing a politician crypto ban highlights their urgency regarding this ethical dimension. Similar to rules preventing insider trading in traditional markets, proponents argue that officials making decisions about crypto policy should not be in a position to profit from those decisions based on their holdings or privileged information. This proposal aims to remove potential conflicts of interest and build public trust in the regulatory process. Whether such a ban gains traction remains to be seen, but its emergence as a central point of discussion demonstrates the increasing scrutiny on the intersection of personal finance, political power, and the digital asset landscape. The concerns over Donald Trump crypto holdings likely serve as a prominent example fueling this push. What This Means for the Future of US Crypto Regulation The failure of this House crypto hearing is undoubtedly a setback for those hoping for swift and clear US crypto regulation . It signals that political disagreements, particularly those touching upon ethics and high-profile figures like Donald Trump crypto involvement, can easily derail progress. Challenges Ahead: Continued Uncertainty: The lack of a unified approach leaves the crypto industry and investors operating in a fragmented and uncertain regulatory environment. Slow Pace of Legislation: Deep political divisions make passing comprehensive crypto bills through both the House and Senate a difficult, time-consuming process. Focus Shift: The emphasis on ethical concerns, while important, can sometimes overshadow broader discussions about market structure, innovation, and consumer protection frameworks. While separate discussions are still happening, they lack the potential impact of a joint, bipartisan effort. Moving forward, bridging this political divide will be crucial for establishing effective US crypto regulation that fosters innovation while protecting consumers and ensuring market integrity. The entanglement of the crypto policy debate with the personal financial interests of politicians, highlighted by the focus on figures like Donald Trump crypto connections and the call for a politician crypto ban , adds a complex layer to an already challenging legislative task. Conclusion: Political Gridlock Delays Crypto Clarity The dramatic collapse of the planned joint House crypto hearing is a stark reminder of the political hurdles facing the development of clear US crypto regulation . Deep disagreements, fueled in part by concerns over high-profile figures like Donald Trump crypto ties and calls for a politician crypto ban , have split lawmakers into separate camps with differing priorities. This fragmentation slows progress on a critical issue for the digital asset industry and leaves stakeholders waiting for clarity. Until these political divisions can be bridged, the path towards comprehensive crypto policy debate and effective regulation in the United States will remain challenging and uncertain.

RCO Finance has raised over $31 million from its ongoing presale as its institutional backing continues to surge. Its user signups have also surged considerably in the past few weeks. Read on to see why experts say Dogecoin could become one of the fastest-growing tokens in the market. Dogecoin Struggles with Volatility in Early May Dogecoin holders are now in a tough position as the token struggles to maintain its recent growth. Despite a recovery in late April, Dogecoin has struggled to maintain those gains, yielding to high volatility. Market charts show that Dogeoin is now trading at $0.1731 following its 4.23% drop over the past week. In contrast, Dogecoin’s 30-day chart shows a 2.64% jump. Following Dogecoin’s volatility, some experts have shifted their stance on earlier growth predictions that said Dogecoin would return to the $0.25 mark by June. With Dogecoin struggling to maintain upward momentum, RCO Finance offers AI-powered tools that allow traders to make smarter, more informed decisions, positioning it as an alternative for those seeking a more stable and scalable option. As a result, RCO Finance is quickly gaining attention as a promising option for those seeking more stable and scalable returns. RCO Finance Surges Following Support from a Major Early ChatGPT Investor In a landscape crowded with DeFi projects promising innovation, RCO Finance emerges as a platform that not only delivers but redefines expectations. As a result, a major early investor into ChatGPT has taken notice of RCO Finance. With its AI-integrated trading system, RCO empowers traders with real-time market insights, personalized strategies, and risk-optimized execution—all in a single, easy-to-use interface. At the core of RCO Finance’s appeal is its mission to democratize finance.

This multi-market access is seamlessly powered by AI algorithms that continuously scan and analyze data, providing users with the kind of smart decision-making support typically reserved for institutional investors. These AI algorithms power RCO Finance’s intuitive dashboard, which comes with smart portfolio management, showing asset breakdowns, market values, and growth trends. These features allow traders to track portfolio health in real time while offering easy navigation across devices. RCO Finance users also enjoy an AI-powered dashboard that offers real-time investment analytics powered by AI. Traders can track deposits, profits, withdrawals, and total account value.

With trading volume climbing and features like LaunchLab and perpetuals gaining traction, the big question returns: Can RAY break back to $8 or maybe even $18 before the end of 2025? Raydium has solid momentum, but there’s another name drawing attention quickly. Unstaked (UNSD) , a low-market-cap AI project, just raised nearly $1 million in under a week through its public presale. Unlike many early tokens, Unstaked already has AI agent infrastructure built and planned to launch right after the token listing. Let’s break down where Raydium could go next, and why Unstaked might offer even bigger potential in timing, utility, and return. Raydium Forecast: Solid Growth Ahead, But Some Volatility First Raydium’s April rally brought it back into the spotlight. Analysts tracking key signals like the RSI and MFI are noticing a possible cooldown coming. With RSI at 74.46 and MFI above 80, the data points to overbought territory, and some believe a dip toward $2.20 could be next. That said, the bigger picture still looks good for Raydium. As Solana bounces back and meme coin trading stays strong, Raydium could keep rising. It’s already holding its spot as the third-biggest DEX by volume, at times even beating Uniswap v3. New tools like LaunchLab and upcoming cross-chain moves through Wormhole could push the project even further. Analyst models suggest RAY could close the year somewhere between $3 and $8. Looking ahead to 2030, some bullish projections even call for $15 to $30 if DeFi keeps gaining traction and Raydium keeps improving. Unstaked (UNSD): AI-Powered Growth With Early ROI Potential While Raydium benefits from Solana’s DeFi rebound, Unstaked brings something entirely new: AI agents built to scale Web3 communities with no human input. Unstaked lets users launch smart AI agents that handle tasks like posting, moderating, and boosting engagement on platforms like Telegram and X. These agents aren’t in testing; they’re complete systems set to go live once the token lists, ready to support Web3 projects hands-free. What sets it apart is its Proof of Intelligence (PoI) system, a built-in reward system that tracks agent performance and pays in UNSD tokens only when the work meets set standards. Put simply, no work means no reward. This makes for a transparent AI setup where everything depends on real output. Right now, Unstaked is in Stage 2 of its public presale at $0.006695, aiming for a $0.1819 launch price. That means early buyers could see 2,700% ROI, backed by a $20 million liquidity pool already locked. Unlike RAY, which has mostly priced in its big moves since 2021, Unstaked is at the beginning, gaining attention with over $950,000 raised from new buyers. Unstaked and Raydium: A Side-by-Side Look at Potential Raydium is a DeFi/DEX token on the Solana network with uses in governance and liquidity incentives. It is live and fully operational, benefiting from high trading volumes and growing total value locked (TVL). Price forecasts suggest a moderate range of $3 to $8 in 2025, with more optimistic estimates exceeding $15. Unstaked, on the other hand, is an AI Agent Protocol that operates across multiple chains. Its token utility revolves around agent rewards and protocol governance. Although it’s currently in its presale phase, it has already raised nearly $1 million. The projected ROI from its presale price to launch is 2,700%. Its key advantage is being the first to market with functional AI agents and a built-in reward system. Raydium offers scale and liquidity in DeFi, but Unstaked presents a compelling early-stage opportunity in a rapidly emerging AI segment. Why Early AI Access Might Lead to Big Gains Unstaked isn’t here to compete with DeFi giants like Raydium. It’s here to solve a new challenge: how to automate and scale Web3 activity without hiring large teams. With mini apps like Notcoin going viral and most NFT or DeFi platforms relying on X and Telegram, Unstaked’s value is clear. It brings ready-made automation and tracks every result on-chain, offering measurable value that starts immediately after listing. The project has already raised nearly $1 million in just days, showing that buyers aren’t waiting for exchanges; they’re acting now. Raydium Is Proven, But Unstaked Could Multiply Fast Raydium remains strong in the DeFi space, and if markets stay hot, it could reach $8–$15 again with Solana’s rise. But if your goal is to find real upside from a working product, Unstaked may be the stronger play. It’s still early, but presale momentum, working tools, and token setup make it one to watch in 2025. You can still buy in during Stage 2, but once Stage 3 begins, today’s crypto presale price might be gone for good.

ADA Climbs to $0.63 & PEPE Whales Accumulate,https://thecoinrise.com/web3-ai-unlocks-massive-1747-roi-potential-ada-climbs-to-0-63-pepe-whales-accumulate/,"Guesswork is being replaced by real-time analysis and smart algorithms. Many crypto platforms now include advanced tools, but only a few provide true data-backed forecasting power. Cardano (ADA) and Pepe (PEPE) are gaining traction, boosted by whale interest and social momentum. However, Web3 ai brings a deeper level of forecasting accuracy. Using technologies like GRU models, LSTM networks, and sentiment scanning, Web3 ai delivers insights that help users make decisions based on solid data rather than hype, giving it a clear predictive advantage. Cardano (ADA) Sees Continued Strength Toward $1.7 ADA recently moved up to $0.63, a 2.6% gain that points to upward momentum. Market analysts are pointing toward a $1.7 target, based on growing institutional attention and slow but steady accumulation. Technical patterns also show a rising structure, including an ascending triangle, which generally reflects strength in the trend. Should broader economic conditions hold steady, ADA’s steady fundamentals and stronger participation levels may fuel further price increases. Many observers are keeping watch on its movement toward the $1.7 barrier. Pepe (PEPE) Price Driven by Rising Whale Activity PEPE has seen a major boost in trading activity, with nearly $1.5 billion added recently. Much of this has come from large-scale buyers, often called whales, who are increasing their PEPE holdings. Such activity often hints at price growth expectations. Chart signals also point to strong momentum. The RSI has broken past 50, suggesting higher buying pressure. Also, the 30-period average closing in on the 200-period line may form the classic bullish pattern known as a golden cross. If these signals persist, analysts believe PEPE could move toward the $0.000015 to $0.000025 level in the coming months. Still, given the unpredictable nature of crypto, it’s wise to remain aware of possible swings. Web3 ai: Where Smart Crypto Forecasting Begins Entering this AI-based crypto platform’s presale gives more than just access, it unlocks tools used to read price shifts before they unfold. With systems like GRU and LSTM combined with sentiment analyzers, Web3 ai scans massive datasets to deliver sharper insights. These features provide a technical advantage for anyone aiming to make decisions with more clarity. Currently priced at $0.0003 during its crypto presale , Web3 ai is set to list at $0.005242, offering a projected 1747% ROI by the time it hits the market. This phase presents a narrow window to access AI-powered predictions before they become common in trading platforms. As more systems turn to automation and data models, early access could be the deciding factor in gaining a head start. Those seeking top crypto coins should take note, this is a path to gain early access to analytical tools that could define future trading. The window to lead before AI becomes the norm is now. Final Say! Navigating crypto trends now requires more than instinct; it calls for tools that decode signals in real-time. While Cardano and PEPE generate movement through whale signals and community buzz, Web3 ai equips users with decision-making support drawn from high-speed data scanning. The platform’s AI-based features don’t just provide entry points; they offer full-spectrum analysis. Web3 ai isn’t just about coin access, it enables clearer planning and faster response to shifts in the crypto market.

SUI is back in the spotlight as price forecasts shift upward, thanks to growing activity in DeFi and the upcoming launch of SuiPlay 0X1. Solana (SOL), on the other hand, holds its ground as a favorite for the long term, backed by rising developer interest and all-time high usage stats. Amid these shifts, BlockDAG (BDAG) is quickly becoming the talk of the presale space, offering an entry at just $0.0019 for a short time. With CEX listings now confirmed and buyers rushing to secure this rare window, BDAG’s presence is getting harder to ignore. Between gaming developments, strong price forecasts, and presale standouts, this month is packed with opportunity. SUI Price Prediction Grows with DeFi and SuiPlay Launch SUI’s price action has turned heads since it bounced back strongly from its April low. After jumping 40% from $1.93 to $3.60, experts have started lifting their year-end SUI price prediction into higher zones. The push is largely due to rising DeFi usage and the much-anticipated launch of SuiPlay 0X1, a platform focused on gaming innovation. These factors are now central to analyst models, many of which now suggest price targets between $5.05 and $6.25, depending on how fast user activity scales in the coming months. SUI’s edge may come from its unique blend of speed and gaming focus. With more staking activity and gameplay interest building up, SUI could soon challenge bigger names among Layer 1 chains. Traders now see SUI’s strategy as a possible game-winner if conditions align by late 2025. Solana Long-Term Outlook Gains Ground with Key Metrics Solana’s long-term outlook is still solid, even with short-term uncertainty on the charts. Some technical indicators show mixed results, but core fundamentals stay strong. Solana just crossed the $400 billion transaction mark, showing it’s still one of the fastest-growing networks in the space. Supporting that, DEX volume has surged 44% in just one week, and user activity keeps climbing. These metrics are reassuring for traders watching SOL hover around the $145 level. If buying pressure returns, a move toward $157 is likely the next target. Analysts say the Solana long-term outlook depends on whether its dApps can continue delivering real value. If fee generation and user growth continue to rise, Solana may stay at the top of Layer 1 rankings throughout 2025. Listings Announcement Coming as BlockDAG Draws Rush at $0.0019 Price BlockDAG (BDAG) has just confirmed plans for listings on centralized exchanges, pulling major attention toward the project. This confirmation is giving fresh confidence to early supporters, while attracting new buyers rushing to get in before the price jumps. Right now, BlockDAG is offering a limited-time entry price of $0.0019, valid only until May 13. This stands in contrast to the Batch 28 rate of $0.0262 and the planned launch price of $0.05. With over $226.5 million already raised and more than 19.7 billion coins sold, the project is seeing a strong final push in its presale phase. The numbers are hard to ignore. Early backers who bought in during Batch 1 are now looking at up to 2,520% in gains. Miner sales have crossed $6.9 million, with 17,310 units sold, proof of growing network strength and community participation. What’s driving the rush is not just pricing. It’s the momentum building around BlockDAG’s future. As the coin moves closer to public trading, this may be the final opportunity to enter before prices move to the open market. For those watching from the sidelines, time is running out to act before this rare offer closes. Wrapping Up SUI continues to rise on the back of DeFi and gaming potential, while Solana holds its lead with unmatched network stats. But all eyes are now on BlockDAG as it heads to major exchanges and offers its special presale price of $0.0019. With early buyers already seeing strong returns and excitement growing around what’s next, the current entry window is one of the last chances to join before public trading begins. For traders seeking top crypto picks this May, BlockDAG might be the opportunity they were waiting for.

While not directly tied to cryptocurrencies, significant international trade agreements, such as the recently announced US India Trade Deal , highlight the dynamic nature of global finance and political relations, factors that often influence broader market sentiment. Understanding these shifts is crucial for any informed investor, regardless of their preferred asset class. Trump Announces Landmark US India Trade Deal Former U.S. President Donald Trump recently made a significant announcement regarding trade relations between the United States and India. According to a report by Watcher Guru on X, Trump stated that India has agreed to eliminate all tariffs on American products as part of a new trade agreement. This move is reportedly aimed at fostering a more equitable and mutually beneficial trade relationship between the two major global economies. The announcement signals a potential turning point in the trade dynamics between the US and India, which have seen various periods of negotiation and disagreement over market access and tariff structures. Tariffs, essentially taxes on imported goods, can significantly impact the cost of products, affecting both producers and consumers. Their removal, as suggested by Trump, could open up new avenues for American businesses exporting to India and potentially lower costs for Indian consumers accessing US goods. What Does the Removal of India Tariffs US Goods Mean? The core of this potential agreement lies in the removal of India Tariffs US Goods . For years, tariffs have been a point of contention in US-India trade discussions. The US has often argued for greater market access in India, citing high tariffs on various American products, including agricultural goods, automobiles, and manufactured items. Eliminating these tariffs could have several implications: Increased Competitiveness: American products would become cheaper in the Indian market, making them more competitive against domestic goods and products from other countries. Boost for US Exporters: US companies exporting to India could see increased demand and profitability due to lower costs for their Indian buyers. Potential Benefits for Indian Consumers: Reduced tariffs could lead to lower prices for certain American goods in India, offering consumers more choices and potentially saving them money. Simplified Trade Process: Removing tariff barriers can simplify customs procedures and reduce administrative burdens for businesses engaged in bilateral trade. While the announcement from Trump is notable, the specifics of which tariffs would be removed, the timeline for implementation, and the scope of the agreement would be critical details that are yet to be fully disclosed or confirmed by both sides through official channels. Analyzing the Trump India Trade Perspective From the Trump India Trade perspective, this agreement aligns with his long-standing focus on renegotiating trade deals he viewed as unfavorable to the United States. Throughout his presidency, Trump prioritized reducing trade deficits and pushing partner countries to lower their barriers to American goods. His approach often involved using tariffs as leverage to encourage negotiation. This particular announcement, if it materializes into a formal agreement, could be framed as a significant achievement in securing better market terms for US businesses in a large and growing economy like India. It reflects a continuation of the ‘America First’ trade policy aimed at creating what he describes as ‘fair’ trade conditions. It’s important to note that trade negotiations are complex and often involve concessions from both sides. While the focus of the announcement is on India removing tariffs, the full scope of any potential agreement would likely involve commitments or adjustments from the US side as well. The Significance of a Bilateral Trade Agreement Formalizing a comprehensive Bilateral Trade Agreement between the US and India would be a major development. Despite being strategic partners with significant trade volumes, the two countries have not yet concluded a broad free trade agreement. Negotiations have historically faced hurdles related to market access, agricultural subsidies, intellectual property rights, and digital trade. A potential agreement focused on tariff removal could be a step towards a more integrated economic partnership. Such agreements typically aim to: Goal of Bilateral Trade Agreements Potential Impact on US-India Trade Reduce or Eliminate Tariffs & Trade Barriers Lower costs for goods, increased trade volume. Promote Investment Flows Encourage US companies to invest in India and vice versa. Harmonize Regulations & Standards Make it easier for businesses to operate in both markets. Establish Dispute Resolution Mechanisms Provide a framework for resolving trade disagreements. While Trump’s announcement specifically mentioned tariff removal, a full bilateral agreement would likely encompass a much wider range of trade and investment issues. The successful negotiation and implementation of such a deal could significantly deepen economic ties between the two nations. Examining the Potential Economic Impact The potential Economic Impact of India removing tariffs on US goods is multifaceted. For the United States, increased exports to India could support job growth in export-oriented industries and contribute positively to the trade balance. Sectors that have faced high tariffs in India, such as agriculture, manufacturing, and potentially technology, could see notable benefits. For India, while tariff removal might initially expose some domestic industries to increased competition, it could also lead to lower input costs for businesses that rely on imported American components or machinery. Furthermore, access to cheaper US goods could benefit consumers. A formal agreement could also attract more foreign direct investment from the US, bringing capital, technology, and management expertise. However, economic impacts are rarely one-sided. Domestic industries in both countries might face adjustment challenges. The overall success and impact would depend heavily on the specifics of the agreement, the sectors covered, and the pace of implementation. Global economic conditions and other geopolitical factors would also play a role in shaping the ultimate outcomes. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for US-India Trade? The announcement from Donald Trump introduces a new dimension to the ongoing conversation about US-India trade relations. While the details of this potential agreement are yet to be fully elaborated and confirmed by official sources from both governments, it highlights a continued desire from the US side to secure better trade terms with India. Key questions remain: What specific tariffs are included in this agreement? What is the proposed timeline for implementation? Are there reciprocal commitments from the US side? How will this announcement be received and potentially advanced by the current administrations in both countries? The future of US-India trade will depend on continued dialogue, negotiation, and the political will to finalize and implement agreements that are perceived as beneficial by both nations. Such developments in international trade policy are worth monitoring, not just for those directly involved in import/export, but also for anyone interested in the broader economic trends that influence global markets, including the increasingly interconnected world of digital assets. Conclusion: A Step Towards Stronger Economic Ties? Donald Trump’s announcement regarding India’s agreement to remove tariffs on US goods marks a potentially significant step in strengthening US India Trade Deal dynamics. If realized, the removal of India Tariffs US Goods could offer tangible benefits for American exporters and potentially Indian consumers, driving a positive Economic Impact . This development underscores the ongoing efforts to shape the Bilateral Trade Agreement landscape between these two major economies. While details are awaited, the prospect of improved trade terms reflects a continued focus on fostering a more balanced relationship, aligning with the principles often emphasized in Trump India Trade discussions.

Bittensor (TAO), one of the most discussed names, saw a parabolic rally driven by speculation around decentralized machine learning. At one point, social feeds were buzzing with TAO price updates, and many who caught the early wave witnessed serious gains. But now, momentum is slipping. Trading volumes are thinning out, growth is tapering off, and fresh capital is turning its head elsewhere. With altcoins rotating out and newer narratives dominating headlines, presales are regaining serious traction. One project rising quickly through the ranks is Qubetics ($TICS), a utility-based token currently in Stage 33 of its crypto presale . Its unique combination of cross-border functionality, a developer IDE, and real-world payment integration has many analysts already dubbing it the Top Altcoin for Massive Return Potential in 2025. Bittensor’s Peak Was a Lesson in Timing When Bittensor first dropped, few expected it to grow from a niche AI play to one of the most talked-about assets in the Layer-1 space. Built on a decentralized intelligence economy model, TAO’s architecture was designed to incentivize knowledge-sharing neural networks. For a moment, it appeared as though it would redefine how data is monetized. But like many breakout cryptos, Bittensor’s gains were largely reserved for those who entered early. Its low-circulating supply model added rocket fuel to its initial surge, pushing its valuation beyond expectations. However, as AI hype simmered down and regulatory concerns over training models increased, TAO faced the natural slowdown that comes when exponential growth collides with market reality. TAO’s price appreciation provided early believers with financial windfalls, but today’s entry points offer far less upside. The asset has matured—and so has its risk profile. Meanwhile, presale-stage projects like Qubetics are drawing attention from traders seeking steep ROI potential rather than incremental gains. Qubetics ($TICS) Has Entered the Chat — With Real-World Solutions Qubetics isn’t selling hype—it’s delivering use cases. The token supports a fully integrated Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet, complete with user-defined security layers, seamless token swaps, and staking support. But what truly separates it from typical presale tokens is its real-world application engine. $TICS isn’t just a store of value—it’s a tool for solving everyday payment and development challenges. From logistics firms needing fast, low-cost cross-border settlements to freelancers handling recurring international payments, Qubetics is offering a blockchain solution that works outside the speculative loop. And that’s rare in crypto presale environments. Here are the updated presale details: Stage: 33rd Current Price: $0.2302 Tokens Sold: 511 million Total Raised: $16.7 million Holders: Over 25,800 The current entry point still offers exposure to massive upside. If $TICS reaches $1 post-presale, the return is 334%. At $5, that ROI spikes to 2071%. Analysts forecasting a mainnet valuation of $10–$15 have outlined returns as high as 6414%, making it the definitive Top Altcoin for Massive Return Potential this cycle. Real-Life Use Cases That Don’t Sound Like Sci-Fi Unlike coins that pitch vague Web3 dreams, Qubetics has built a practical stack. Its ecosystem includes tools developers can use now—like QubeQode, a smart contract IDE that accelerates build times without requiring Solidity mastery. Then there’s the Qubetics Wallet, which connects directly to real-world payment rails and lets users pay in crypto but settle in local currencies across 100+ countries. Think of a small apparel manufacturer in the Philippines sourcing materials from Vietnam, shipping to Australia, and selling to Canada. With Qubetics, payments, settlements, and currency swaps happen in one tap—without going through costly third-party processors or enduring multi-day delays. Even freelancers and digital creators now have a way to receive crypto payments, convert them instantly, and stake idle funds while they wait for client confirmations. Qubetics removes friction, and that’s what real-world adoption looks like. Because of this, experts now classify $TICS not just as a utility token, but as a Top Altcoin for Massive Return Potential thanks to its long-term relevance outside the speculation bubble. Why Timing Qubetics Is Like Catching Bitcoin Under $10 Presale coins that survive beyond hype cycles often deliver the largest returns in crypto history. Bitcoin did it. Ethereum did it. And now, analysts are saying Qubetics is built to follow suit—not just because of timing, but because of fundamentals. The current crypto presale price of $0.2302 is still considered an entry window with explosive upside. As market attention shifts from overbought assets like Bittensor to underpriced utility tokens, $TICS could become the next breakout chart everyone’s talking about. Unlike meme coins that rely on viral trends, Qubetics is backed by an ecosystem that’s already solving problems for thousands globally. And that’s the real takeaway here—while Bittensor marked a powerful moment in AI token history, Qubetics is shaping up to define a new era in cross-border blockchain adoption. Final Verdict: Top Altcoin for Massive Return Potential Bittensor was the prototype for decentralized AI. It paved the way, built excitement, and rewarded early entries—but it also capped out quickly for anyone late to the party. Now, attention is turning toward tokens that are early in their lifecycle, backed by real-world use cases, and capable of scaling beyond just crypto headlines. Qubetics checks every one of those boxes. With crypto presale momentum, affordable access, and projected post-mainnet prices as high as $15, it’s no longer a hidden gem. It’s the Top Altcoin for Massive Return Potential , and entry windows are closing fast.

44259252,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157801,1746584435,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,AI in Biology: FutureHouse Unveils Promising Tool for Scientific Discovery,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/futurehouse-ai-biology-tool/,"In the rapidly evolving world of technology and science, artificial intelligence continues to push boundaries. FutureHouse, a non-profit organization supported by Eric Schmidt, is making strides in applying AI to complex fields like biology. Their ambitious goal is to develop an “AI scientist” capable of automating significant parts of the research process within the next decade. Recently, FutureHouse provided a preview of their new AI in biology tool, Finch, designed to support “data-driven discovery.” Understanding the FutureHouse AI Research Tool: Finch Finch is positioned as a powerful new AI research tool aimed at accelerating biological discovery. It operates by processing large volumes of biological data, primarily from research papers. Users provide a prompt, such as querying molecular drivers of diseases, and Finch then executes code, generates visual figures, and analyzes the results. FutureHouse co-founder and CEO Sam Rodriques likened its current capabilities to those of a “first-year grad student.” Data Input: Primarily research papers and other biological datasets. Process: Takes prompts, runs code, generates figures, inspects results. Capabilities: Supports open-ended analysis and directed tasks like differential expression analysis. Speed: Capable of performing complex analyses in minutes. Rodriques highlighted the speed aspect, noting that being able to perform these tasks in minutes is a “superpower.” He also mentioned that Finch has already helped FutureHouse’s internal projects uncover “really cool stuff.” The Promise of AI for Scientific Discovery FutureHouse’s initiative aligns with a broader vision shared by many tech leaders: that AI will fundamentally transform the scientific process. The potential for scientific discovery to be massively accelerated by advanced AI tools is a compelling prospect. Leaders like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei have articulated bold predictions, suggesting AI could speed up breakthroughs, potentially even aiding in finding cures for major diseases like cancer. The field of AI drug discovery is particularly attractive, with market estimates pointing to significant growth. Precedence Research projected the market value at $65.88 billion in 2024, potentially reaching $160.31 billion by 2034. This growth potential underscores the intense interest and investment flowing into this sector. Navigating Challenges in AI Drug Discovery Despite the optimism and market potential, the path for AI drug discovery is not without hurdles. The article notes that evidence of AI leading to major, novel scientific breakthroughs is still limited. Many researchers remain cautious about the current utility of AI in guiding the core scientific process. Real-world applications have faced difficulties. Several companies leveraging AI for drug discovery, such as Exscientia and BenevolentAI, have experienced high-profile clinical trial failures. Furthermore, the accuracy of even leading AI systems, like Google DeepMind’s AlphaFold 3 for protein structure prediction, can vary. Finch itself, while promising, is not immune to errors. Rodriques admitted that the tool currently makes “silly mistakes.” To address this, FutureHouse is actively recruiting bioinformaticians and computational biologists. Their role will be crucial in evaluating Finch’s accuracy and reliability during its closed beta phase, helping to train the tool and improve its performance. FutureHouse AI: Beta Program and Next Steps FutureHouse’s decision to launch Finch in a closed beta and involve domain experts highlights a pragmatic approach to development. By collaborating with bioinformaticians and computational biologists, they aim to refine the tool’s capabilities and build confidence in its outputs before a wider release. This feedback loop is essential for developing a reliable AI research tool that can genuinely assist in complex biological investigations. While the vision of a fully autonomous “AI scientist” is still some time away, tools like Finch represent tangible steps towards augmenting human researchers’ abilities. The ability to quickly process vast datasets and identify potential areas of interest could significantly reduce the time spent on initial analysis, freeing up scientists to focus on experimental validation and deeper investigation. Conclusion: A Step Forward for AI in Biology FutureHouse’s preview of Finch marks an important development in the application of AI to scientific research. While the tool is still in development and faces challenges common to early-stage AI systems, its potential to accelerate data analysis in biology is clear. The success of Finch and similar tools will depend on continued development, rigorous validation, and effective integration into existing research workflows. As the field progresses, AI is set to play an increasingly vital role in driving future scientific discovery , potentially unlocking new insights into biology and health.

The Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement Act, or the MEME Act, aims to prevent federal officials from using their position to profit from memecoins , Democrat Senator Chris Murphy said in a May 6 statement. If passed, the MEME Act prohibits the president, vice president, members of Congress, senior executive branch officials, their spouses and children from issuing, sponsoring, or promoting a security, future, commodity, or digital asset, according to the bill’s description. Today I’m introducing a bill - the MEME Act - to ban a President or Member of Congress from issuing a meme coin.

US Representative Sam Liccardo, another Democrat, introduced companion legislation in the House of Representatives. However, Trump’s party, the Republicans, controls both chambers, and the legislation will need Republican support. Meanwhile, Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, a ranking member of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI), said in a May 6 statement that the committee is opening a preliminary inquiry into the Official Trump (TRUMP) token, Trump-backed platform World Liberty Financial (WLFI), and other associated business ventures. As part of the inquiry, the PSI sent letters to the company behind the Trump coin, Fight Fight Fight, and WLFI, asking for records and communications between the companies and the Trump organization.

Main points of interest flagged by the PSI include fees the president is making on the TRUMP token and the nearly 50% spike in value from $9.40 to $13.65 after the TRUMP coin website announced on April 23 that the top 220 holders of the token would be invited to a gala dinner at the White House. Soon after launch on Jan. 18 , the Trump coin hit its all-time high of $73.43, according to CoinGecko. However, it has since lost 85% of its value and is trading for $11.13. More than half of TRUMP holders in profit Roughly two million wallets have bought TRUMP, with an extra 54,000 adding the token to their stash after the dinner announcement, according to data shared with Cointelegraph from blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis. Around 764,000 of these, most with small holdings, lost money on the coin, while the 58 investors in the token have made profits of over $10 million each, totaling an estimated $1.1 billion. At the same time, Chainalysis says the memecoin creator has made $320 million so far, with an extra $1.3 million coming in since the White House dinner announcement.

The belief appears to come from an unverified private letter supposedly sent by Yu to a Zerebro investor, trading activity linked to crypto wallets owned by Yu, and the removal of his obituary from Legacy.com. Others speculate that Yu used a tool to pass off a pre-edited video as if it were filmed in real-time during the Pump.fun livestream. Source: Hash The unverified letter from Yu to an early investor states that he deliberately created a livestream pretending to shoot himself as it was the only “viable exit” from persistent harassment, blackmail, threats and hate crimes. “Being fully doxxed has placed me under constant fear of robbery and physical harm. There have been numerous notable figures in the crypto community which have undergone armed robberies in their homes recently.” “With my address publicly known, I have not been able to comfortably reside in any of my family’s homes for months now.” The letter claimed he would “exit public life and fame” and shift his focus to music, conducted in anonymity. In addition to the unverified letter, Legacy.com removed Yu’s obituary, which initially described him as a Stanford “tech prodigy” who scaled the AI content-powered Zerebro protocol into an $800 million ecosystem at its peak. Source: Vee X user and crypto enthusiast “Vee” also claimed that after Yu’s supposed death, one of his wallets offloaded the Zerebro (ZEREBRO) token for USDC ( USDC ), which was then moved to the same address that created the Legacoin (LLJEFFY) token. Vee’s claims were later supported by blockchain analytics firm Bubblemaps, which estimated that $100,000 of ZEREBRO was sold and moved to LLJEFFY.

But many experts and analysts believe that goal is unlikely — at least in the short term. To reach $100, XRP’s market value would need to rise to around trillions, more than triple the current size of Bitcoin’s market cap. While XRP is aiming to disrupt massive industries like global payments, tokenized real-world assets, and carbon credits — which together are worth hundreds of trillions — such a price jump is still a long shot for now. The truth is, XRP is making progress and has real-world utility, especially in international payments. But major adoption takes time, especially when working with banks and institutions that move slowly and are still benefiting from traditional systems like SWIFT. That’s why many are urging the XRP community to manage expectations. Altcoin Bale said that while a $100 target may sound exciting, it’s more realistic to prepare for XRP to reach around $20 in the near term. Hitting that level would still represent a strong return from current prices. XRP Price Prediction (Short Term) XRP is currently trading within a falling channel pattern on the weekly chart, a setup that often signals long-term accumulation. Despite the downward trend, analysts suggest the price may be approaching a key support zone that could lead to a reversal. According to the latest analysis, the $1.85 level is seen as a strong support area. $XRP /USDT Weekly Analysis #XRP Price is still moving inside a falling channel with clear accumulation behavior.

The worlds of high fashion, cutting-edge blockchain technology, and immersive gaming are colliding in an exciting new way. Major brands continue to explore the potential of Web3, and Adidas is stepping back into the spotlight with a significant move in the realm of crypto gaming . This time, they’re setting their sights on the Sui Blockchain , partnering with the upcoming third-person shooter RPG, Xociety, for an exclusive NFT Drop . What Are These Exclusive Adidas NFTs All About? Adidas has announced the launch of 2,600 unique mystery box NFTs designed specifically for the anticipated Xociety Game . These aren’t just digital collectibles; they offer tangible utility within the game world, primarily providing exclusive in-game skins featuring iconic Adidas-branded apparel. Imagine decking out your character in virtual Adidas gear as you navigate the futuristic landscapes of Xociety! This initiative builds upon Adidas’s previous successful forays into the Web3 space, demonstrating a continued commitment to exploring digital ownership and community engagement through NFTs. Partnering with a game like Xociety allows Adidas to connect with a new demographic and integrate its brand directly into interactive digital experiences. The NFT Drop Details: Where and When? Mark your calendars! The minting of these highly anticipated Adidas NFTs is scheduled for May 16th. The chosen platform for this exclusive event is Tradeport, a prominent marketplace within the Sui Blockchain ecosystem. This strategic choice highlights the growing importance of Sui as a platform for large-scale brand activations and digital asset launches. Here’s a quick breakdown of what to expect from the drop: Total Supply: 2,600 Mystery Box NFTs Blockchain: Sui Minting Platform: Tradeport Mint Date: May 16th Utility: In-game skins for Xociety featuring Adidas branding Rarity Tiers: Four distinct tiers, suggesting different levels of exclusivity or visual variations for the in-game items. The mystery box format adds an element of surprise and excitement, common in NFT drops and gaming loot boxes, encouraging participation and speculation on which rarity tier players might receive. Why Sui Blockchain ? Adidas’s decision to launch on Sui is noteworthy. While many initial brand NFT projects gravitated towards established chains like Ethereum or Polygon, Sui represents a newer generation of blockchain technology known for its high throughput, low transaction costs, and developer-friendly environment, particularly suited for gaming and high-volume transactions. This could signal growing confidence in Sui’s infrastructure and its potential to support scalable Web3 gaming experiences like Xociety. Sui’s object-centric model is designed to handle parallel processing, making it potentially more efficient for managing dynamic in-game assets and complex interactions compared to account-centric models. This technical advantage could be a key factor in supporting a smooth experience for Xociety players using their Adidas NFT skins. How Does This Connect to the Xociety Game ? Xociety is shaping up to be an intriguing addition to the crypto gaming landscape. As a third-person shooter RPG, it aims to blend action-packed gameplay with role-playing elements and, crucially, Web3 mechanics. The partnership with Adidas provides significant mainstream brand validation for Xociety even before its full launch. The integration of Adidas NFT skins means players who own these digital assets will have a unique way to customize their in-game appearance, potentially offering bragging rights or visual distinction within the game world. This kind of exclusive, branded content can be a powerful driver for both NFT adoption and game engagement. Beyond Skins: The Revenue-Sharing Model One of the most compelling aspects of this collaboration, as reported by Blockworks, is the inclusion of a revenue-sharing deal. While specific details of the model are often complex and depend on the agreement between Adidas, Xociety, and potentially the NFT holders, this suggests that owning these Adidas NFTs could offer more than just cosmetic benefits. Revenue sharing in Web3 gaming can take various forms, such as a portion of in-game transaction fees, marketplace royalties, or other income streams distributed among NFT holders. This model aligns with the Web3 ethos of rewarding players and early supporters, turning passive consumers into active stakeholders with a vested interest in the game’s success. It adds a layer of potential financial benefit on top of the in-game utility, making the NFT Drop even more attractive. Actionable Insights: Getting Involved If you’re interested in potentially acquiring one of these exclusive Adidas NFTs for the Xociety Game , here’s what you should consider: Research Xociety: Understand the game itself. Is it a game you’re genuinely interested in playing? The primary utility of the NFT is tied to the game. Prepare for the Sui Blockchain: Ensure you have a compatible wallet that supports Sui and have some SUI tokens ready for potential minting costs or marketplace purchases. Monitor Tradeport: Keep an eye on the Tradeport platform as the May 16th date approaches for specific minting mechanics, pricing, and any eligibility requirements. Understand the Rarity Tiers: While details are scarce, be aware that there are four tiers, likely impacting the visual design or perceived value of the in-game skin you receive. Assess the Revenue Sharing: Try to find more detailed information about the revenue-sharing model closer to the mint date to understand the potential long-term benefits of holding the NFT. As with any NFT investment or participation in crypto gaming projects, it’s crucial to do your own thorough research (DYOR) and understand the risks involved. Benefits and Challenges This collaboration presents several potential benefits: For Adidas: Deeper engagement with the gaming and Web3 communities, exploring new revenue streams, staying at the forefront of digital innovation. For Xociety: Significant brand visibility and legitimacy boost, attracting a wider audience beyond typical crypto users, exclusive content offering for players. For Sui: Validation as a capable platform for major brand partnerships and gaming applications, increased transaction volume and user activity. For Players/NFT Holders: Exclusive in-game cosmetic items, potential participation in revenue sharing, ownership of a unique digital asset from a major brand. However, challenges exist: Market Adoption: Will mainstream gamers embrace the Web3 elements and NFTs? Execution Risk: The success relies on both the quality of the Xociety game and the smooth implementation of the NFT utility and revenue sharing. NFT Market Volatility: The value of the NFTs on the secondary market can be highly unpredictable. Technical Hurdles: Ensuring a seamless user experience for acquiring and using NFTs within the game. The Growing Trend of Brands in Crypto Gaming Adidas is not the first major brand to venture into crypto gaming or utilize NFTs, but this specific collaboration highlights a maturing trend. We’ve seen various levels of engagement, from simple collectible drops to more integrated experiences. This partnership with Xociety and the focus on in-game utility and revenue sharing represent a deeper integration than many earlier brand NFT projects. This trend is significant because it brings mainstream attention and potentially millions of new users into the Web3 space. As more reputable brands and high-quality games enter this arena, the perceived legitimacy and potential for mass adoption of blockchain technology and NFTs grow. Conclusion: A Glimpse into the Future of Digital Assets The upcoming launch of 2,600 exclusive Adidas NFTs on the Sui Blockchain for the Xociety Game is more than just another NFT Drop ; it’s a clear indicator of the evolving relationship between major global brands, blockchain technology, and the interactive world of video games. By offering in-game utility and a potential revenue-sharing model, Adidas and Xociety are attempting to create a more compelling value proposition for digital ownership. This collaboration leverages the unique capabilities of the Sui Blockchain and positions Xociety as a game to watch in the competitive crypto gaming sector. While challenges remain for widespread adoption, initiatives like this pave the way for a future where digital assets from our favorite brands are seamlessly integrated into the virtual worlds we inhabit, offering both cosmetic appeal and potential economic benefits.

The Federal Reserve, under Chair Jerome Powell, is all but certain to keep the fed‑funds corridor at 4.25 to 4.50 percent; CME Group’s FedWatch tool assigns a 98.2 percent probability to an unchanged stance. That near‑certainty, however, has not muffled political noise. President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent have publicly pressed for lower borrowing costs, yet Powell’s most recent public remarks on 16 April framed monetary policy as “in a wait‑and‑see mode,” adding that the labor market “is in decent shape” but that the Fed’s “obligation is to keep longer‑term inflation expectations well anchored and to make certain that a one‑time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem.” In effect, the central bank continues to prioritize price stability even as leading indicators imply a cooling economy and a likely pivot to easing in the second half of the year. FOMC Preview For Bitcoin For Bitcoin, the debate is less about whether the Fed blinks tomorrow and more about how algorithmic liquidity and discretionary positioning react to the tone of Powell’s press conference. Crypto trader Josh Rager told his followers on X, “Expect chop chop until FOMC tomorrow. Then after the rate cut announcement, expect volatility. With a reversal during Powell’s speech. That’s my FOMC playbook at the moment.” Although Rager’s baseline presumes an eventual reduction in rates, his near‑term focus is the intraday whipsaw that typically frames the statement‑and‑Q&A window. Related Reading: Strategy Expands Bitcoin Investments With Latest Purchase, Now Holding 555,450 BTC In Total Astronomer (@astronomer_zero) offered a more probabilistic roadmap, emphasizing that his trademarked FOMC‑reversal model has “consistently provided reversals with an over 85 percent chance. If the mechanics continue to play out for this month, that would mean we would (have) top(ped) out this or last week before a significant move down.” Yet he tempers that historical edge by noting that the prevailing quarterly uptrend in Bitcoin could blunt the signal: “That would mean that this and/or next FOMC meeting both have a weakened reversal effect in the midst of what I expect to be a strong uptrend.” In practical terms, he foresees: “I think the most likely scenario (76% chance) is a move up from here and the FOMC reversal gets completely ignored. The smaller chance (24%) is indeed a rather shallow pullback within our stoploss area.” Related Reading: LMACD Indicator Reveals Where The Bitcoin Price Is After Rejection From $97,000 Columbus (@columbus0x) looks to the microstructure for confirmation. Citing a Hyblock heat‑map of liquidations, he expects “a wick below into the box… below the equal lows and also exactly the area that Hyblock has highlighted as a yellow zone,” a region that coincides with the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement from the last significant swing low. Should Powell strike a hawkish tone, Columbus anticipates “a deviation below the range low / a retest of the 200‑day SMA, closing the CME gap between $91.8 and$92.4 k – or possibly even dipping into the high $80’s. Nonetheless: trend is up.” Momentum diagnostics add a final layer. Titan of Crypto observes that Bitcoin “is consolidating between last week’s high and low, awaiting tomorrow’s FOMC meeting and Jerome Powell’s speech. Meanwhile, the daily MACD is crossing bearish, signaling slowing momentum.” A confirmed rollover in the histogram would align with the shallow‑pullback scenario outlined by Astronomer and Columbus, yet the consolidation itself keeps higher‑time‑frame trend traders constructive Taken together, tomorrow’s decision appears binary only on the surface; the real determinant is Powell’s forward‑guidance language and its impact on terminal‑rate pricing. If the Chair stresses patience while acknowledging softer data, the curve could begin to discount a June cut, providing a macro tailwind that validates the bulls’ quarterly thesis. Conversely, any hint of renewed vigilance on inflation would embolden short‑term bears hunting liquidity below $92 k. Either way, the tape has little room for complacency: liquidity is thin, options gamma is clustered around the psychologically resonant $100,000 strike, and the narrative energy surrounding a second‑half‑of‑2025 easing cycle is colliding head‑on with the Fed’s near‑term inflation mandate. At press time, BTC traded at $94,097.

The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) has made a significant move by withdrawing its appeal against prediction market platform Kalshi. This decision is a game-changer, effectively clearing a major hurdle and allowing Kalshi to proceed with offering contracts based on political events. If you’re following the intersection of digital platforms, finance, and regulation, this development is definitely worth your attention. What Led to the CFTC and Kalshi Showdown? The story began when Kalshi, a regulated prediction market exchange, sought approval from the CFTC to list contracts related to political outcomes. Think questions like “Will Party A win the popular vote in State B?” or “Will Candidate C be elected?” Kalshi’s argument is that these contracts function as economic hedges or forecasts, providing valuable information and trading opportunities, similar to how markets predict interest rate changes or commodity prices. However, the CFTC initially rejected these proposals, citing concerns that such contracts could be deemed “contrary to the public interest” or constitute illegal gambling under existing interpretations of commodity law. This rejection wasn’t accepted quietly by Kalshi. Believing their proposed markets were legitimate and fell within the regulatory framework for derivatives, Kalshi took the bold step of suing the commission in 2023. The lawsuit challenged the CFTC’s rejection, arguing it was arbitrary and capricious. Kalshi maintained that their platform provided a structured, regulated environment for predicting future events, distinct from traditional betting or gambling. This legal battle put a spotlight on the evolving nature of prediction markets and how they fit into established financial regulations in the United States. The Significance of the CFTC’s Withdrawal Fast forward to today, the CFTC has withdrawn its appeal against Kalshi. According to reports, both parties agreed to drop the case and cover their own legal costs. This withdrawal isn’t just a procedural step; it marks a substantial victory for Kalshi and the broader prediction markets industry. Here’s why this is a big deal: Path Cleared for Political Betting: The immediate effect is that Kalshi is now free to pursue offering contracts on political events, which was the core issue of the lawsuit. This opens up a new category of markets for their users. Regulatory Signal: The withdrawal, especially under the leadership of Acting Chair Caroline Pham, suggests a potential shift or at least a nuanced approach within the CFTC towards prediction markets. It signals a possible willingness to reconsider or allow certain types of event contracts that were previously viewed with skepticism. Precedent Setting: While not a court ruling on the merits, the CFTC backing down in the face of a legal challenge from a regulated entity like Kalshi could set a precedent or at least embolden other platforms or exchanges looking to list similar event contracts. Validation for Kalshi: For Kalshi, this is a major vindication of their legal challenge and their business model. They stood up to the regulator and achieved their goal of getting the initial rejection overturned implicitly through the withdrawal. What Does This Mean for Political Betting and Prediction Markets? The CFTC’s decision has direct implications for the landscape of political betting and prediction markets in the US . Until now, participating in prediction markets related to politics for US residents often involved using offshore platforms, which come with significant risks, including lack of regulation and potential for fraud. Kalshi, being a regulated US entity, offers a different environment. Here’s a look at the potential impacts: Increased Accessibility: Regulated platforms can potentially attract a wider range of users who might be hesitant to use unregulated offshore sites. Enhanced Transparency and Security: Operating under CFTC oversight means adherence to rules regarding market integrity, customer protection, and financial stability, offering users more confidence. More Accurate Forecasting? Proponents argue that liquid prediction markets can aggregate dispersed information and provide more accurate forecasts than traditional polling or expert opinions. Allowing more topics, like politics, could test this hypothesis further. Innovation in Event Contracts: This could pave the way for other types of event contracts on regulated platforms, expanding the scope of what can be traded beyond traditional financial assets. However, challenges remain. The line between a legitimate prediction market contract and illegal gambling can still be blurry in practice and subject to interpretation. Public perception and ethical considerations around betting on sensitive political events will also continue to be discussed. The Regulatory Environment: A New Approach? The timing of the withdrawal, occurring under Acting Chair Caroline Pham, suggests it aligns with her stated approach to regulation. While the article source mentions her leadership in the dismissal, understanding her broader perspective is key. Generally, there’s been a growing conversation within regulatory bodies about how to handle novel financial products and technologies, including those related to crypto and event markets. This specific outcome might indicate a willingness within the CFTC to: Engage with regulated entities bringing forward innovative proposals. Perhaps favor allowing markets unless there’s a clear and compelling reason based on market integrity or public interest concerns, rather than a blanket prohibition. Address regulatory questions through dialogue or reconsiderations, potentially avoiding protracted legal battles where possible. This doesn’t mean the door is wide open for everything. Regulatory bodies like the CFTC still have the mandate to protect market integrity and the public. But the Kalshi outcome suggests that regulated platforms proposing well-structured event contracts might find a more receptive audience or at least a fairer fight than before. What Does This Mean for Users and the Market? For individuals interested in participating in prediction markets , this development means more options may become available on regulated US platforms. It’s crucial, however, to understand exactly what you are trading. These are complex instruments, and like any market, they involve risk. Actionable Insights: Do Your Research: Understand how prediction markets work, the specific contracts offered, and the potential outcomes. Understand the Risks: You can lose the money you put into these contracts. Treat them as speculative investments, not guaranteed returns. Use Regulated Platforms: The advantage of platforms like Kalshi is regulatory oversight, offering protections not found on unregulated sites. Stay Informed: The regulatory landscape for prediction markets and crypto-related financial products is still evolving. Keep up with announcements from the CFTC and other bodies. The ability for a regulated platform to offer political betting contracts could also influence other market participants. We might see other regulated exchanges explore similar offerings, potentially leading to more diverse and liquid markets for event-based predictions. Looking Ahead: The Future of Prediction Markets in the US The CFTC ‘s withdrawal in the Kalshi case is a landmark moment for prediction markets in the US . It signals a potential thawing in the regulatory stance towards certain types of event contracts, particularly those on regulated platforms. While challenges and debates about the nature and appropriateness of certain contracts will undoubtedly continue, this decision provides a significant boost to the industry’s hopes for expansion within the regulated framework. The focus will now shift to how platforms like Kalshi implement these new offerings and how the CFTC continues to oversee this evolving market segment. It’s a dynamic space, and this development has just added a fascinating new chapter to its story.

The upcoming Federal Reserve decision on May 7 could influence Bitcoin’s price movement over the coming days. Bitcoin needs to continue to hold above the $95,000 level for a chance to climb back and retest its all-time high, or face an even deeper correction, crypto analysts say. It comes after several analysts told Cointelegraph earlier this year that June could be the month Bitcoin ( BTC ) reaches new all-time highs. “The $95,000 level — currently under consolidation — is a critical pivot point, acting as the lower boundary of a three-month range that defined market structure between November 2024 and February 2025,” Bitfinex said in a May 6 markets report. Bitcoin holding above $95K would signal a “structural shift” Bitfinex said that Bitcoin holding above the $95,000 level would signal a “structural shift” back into bullish territory, with a potential upward trend toward retesting its all-time highs. Bitcoin reached its $109,000 all-time high on Jan. 20, just hours before US President Donald Trump’s inauguration. At the time of publication, Bitcoin is trading at $96,730, up 3.03% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. However, Bitfinex analysts said if Bitcoin fails to hold above $95,000, it could be headed for further downfall. “Failure to hold, however, could turn the region into resistance once more, raising the risk of a short-term rejection and another leg of corrective price action.” They said the next several days will determine whether Bitcoin will be heading “into a sustained breakout or resolves into a retest of lower support zones.” Bitcoin is up 2% over the past seven days. Source: CoinMarketCap However, if Bitcoin continues the rally, it may catch many traders offside. Crypto analyst Thomas Fahrer said in a May 7 X post that $400 million of Bitcoin short positions are at risk of liquidation at the $98,000 price level. “Send it,” Fahrer said. Bitcoin is approaching the timeframe many analysts predicted for new highs earlier this year. On March 28, Real Vision chief crypto analyst Jamie Coutts projected a best-case target of $123,000 by June . Related: Bitcoin price rallied 1,550% the last time the ‘BTC risk-off’ metric fell this low Around the same time, Swan Bitcoin CEO Cory Klippsten said that Bitcoin has a “50% chance” of reaching new all-time highs before the end of June . Since 2013, Bitcoin’s average performance in June has been slightly negative at -0.35%. The upcoming Federal Reserve interest rate decision on May 7 could also have an impact on Bitcoin’s price. The announcement often sees crypto market volatility both before and after the results are published. However, the latest data from CME Group’s FedWatch Tool indicates that the futures market sees minimal odds of a rate cut . Meanwhile, overall market sentiment is becoming more positive as Bitcoin’s price approaches the psychological $100,000 price level. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , which measures overall market sentiment, has spiked again over the past 24 hours, further into “Greed” territory, jumping 8 points to a score of 67.

For major players like Tether , the issuer of the largest stablecoin, USDT, staying ahead of the curve is paramount. This is particularly true as the industry looks towards bridging the gap between traditional finance and digital assets, notably through RWA tokenization . A significant step in this direction has just been announced: Tether has integrated Chainalysis’ advanced compliance and monitoring tools directly into its Hadron platform. What Does This Tether and Chainalysis Integration Mean? This integration isn’t just a minor update; it’s a strategic move designed to bake institutional-grade oversight directly into the infrastructure of Hadron, Tether’s platform dedicated to tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs). By bringing Chainalysis’ capabilities onboard, Tether is significantly enhancing its ability to manage risk and ensure regulatory adherence across its operations, particularly as it expands into the complex realm of tokenized assets beyond its core Stablecoin business. The integration provides several key benefits: Enhanced Risk Detection: Proactively identifying potential illicit activity or high-risk transactions. Real-Time Transaction Monitoring: Keeping a constant watch on transaction flows to spot suspicious patterns as they happen. Know Your Transaction (KYT) Support: Gaining deeper insights into the nature and parties involved in transactions. These tools are fundamental for any entity handling significant volumes of digital assets, but they become even more critical when dealing with the regulatory complexities associated with RWAs. Why is Crypto Compliance Crucial for Stablecoins and RWA Tokenization? As the crypto market matures, regulators worldwide are increasing their scrutiny. Stablecoin issuers, in particular, face intense pressure due to their potential role in the global financial system. Ensuring robust Crypto Compliance isn’t just good practice; it’s becoming a regulatory necessity for long-term viability and broader adoption. For RWA Tokenization , compliance is perhaps even more critical. Tokenizing assets like real estate, stocks, or commodities brings traditional financial regulations into the digital asset space. Investors, especially institutional ones, demand assurances that the digital representation of their assets is handled with the same level of oversight and security as traditional financial instruments. Compliance tools like those offered by Chainalysis provide the necessary infrastructure to meet these stringent requirements. Boosting Trust and Adoption Through Enhanced Stablecoin Oversight The move to integrate Chainalysis directly into Hadron signals Tether ‘s commitment to transparency and security. For a Stablecoin issuer handling billions in value daily, demonstrating proactive efforts in Crypto Compliance is vital for maintaining trust among users, partners, and regulators. This enhanced oversight is particularly appealing to institutional investors and traditional financial firms considering entering the digital asset space via stablecoins or tokenized RWAs. Think of it this way: institutional players operate within highly regulated environments. They need confidence that the digital assets they interact with meet similar standards. By implementing sophisticated monitoring and compliance tools, Tether makes its platforms, including Hadron for RWA Tokenization , more attractive and accessible to this crucial segment of the market, potentially unlocking significant liquidity and growth. Navigating the Future of RWA Tokenization with Robust Crypto Compliance The Hadron platform is designed to be a gateway for bringing real-world assets onto the blockchain. This involves complex processes, including legal structuring, valuation, and ongoing management. Layering strong Crypto Compliance tools from Chainalysis onto this platform from the outset ensures that the RWA tokens issued via Hadron can meet global regulatory standards from day one. This proactive approach can help Tether and its partners navigate the often-uncertain regulatory landscape surrounding tokenized assets. It positions Hadron not just as a technical platform for tokenization but as a compliant infrastructure capable of handling regulated assets. This could accelerate the adoption of RWA Tokenization by providing a trusted and secure environment for issuers and investors alike. Conclusion: A Strategic Leap for Tether and the RWA Space Tether ‘s integration of Chainalysis into its Hadron platform is a significant development. It underscores the growing importance of robust Crypto Compliance in the digital asset ecosystem, particularly for major stablecoin issuers and platforms focused on RWA Tokenization . This move enhances security, transparency, and regulatory adherence, paving the way for greater institutional participation and solidifying Tether ‘s position as a leader navigating the future of finance. It’s a clear signal that compliance is not an afterthought but a core component of building scalable and trusted digital asset infrastructure.

But a new DeFi powerhouse with 122,000 daily users and a Binance listing in view is igniting investor frenzy. With a rapidly expanding user base and whispers of a major exchange listing, the crypto community is asking: Could this be 2025’s breakout digital asset? Dogecoin’s Meme Magic Loses Steam As of now, Dogecoin (DOGE) stands at $0.1708 with a substantial market cap of $25.48 billion. Despite its enduring popularity, a closer look reveals cracks in its momentum. A 3.3% daily price decline pairs with a dramatic 33.5% plunge in trading volume to $668 million, raising red flags about fading retail interest. Dogecoin’s (DOGE) supply is uncapped, inherently limiting its long-term price growth. Analysts from CoinDCX place its Q3 2025 price target at $0.55 , suggesting modest returns at best. While Dogecoin’s (DOGE) community remains loyal, a new contender, a DeFi juggernaut backed by institutional clout, is rapidly gaining momentum and challenging the status quo. RCO Finance, with its cutting-edge AI-driven features and clear road to major exchange listings, has the potential to achieve Dogecoin’s transformational ambition. RCOF’s $31M Presale Draws Tech Titans RCO Finance (RCOF) has already raised $31 million in its presale, currently in Stage 8 with tokens priced at $0.16, up 1153% from its Stage 1 entry. The sale has drawn attention from both individual investors and heavyweight institutions. A $7.5 million capital injection from a leading VC helped accelerate its growth, with all Stage 6 and 7 tokens acquired by one tech-focused firm. Further elevating its profile, a Big 5 Tech company, an early backer of ChatGPT, has reportedly invested in RCOF, boosting credibility and investor interest. These endorsements have helped drive over 282,000 app downloads and a daily user count of 122,000 on its Beta platform . The roadmap shows a Uniswap launch set for May 31, 2025, with Binance and Coinbase listings anticipated in the summer. Projections suggest a price range of $1.50 to $2.00 post-listing. RCOF’s upcoming full team doxxing, including a former Microsoft board member, adds a layer of transparency rarely seen at this stage. AI-DeFi Fusion Unlocks New Horizons What sets RCO Finance apart isn’t just its momentum; it’s the platform’s functionality. Its no-KYC structure makes access seamless for global users, unlocking 120,000+ tradable assets across crypto, stocks, ETFs, bonds, and tokenized real estate. RCOF’s standout features include Smart Portfolio Management with real-time allocation charts, customizable watchlists with alerts via Telegram and X, and a Wallet Management tool that offers intuitive oversight of assets, including NFTs and savings. A SolidProof audit reinforces the platform’s security standards. At the heart of this platform lies the AI Robo Advisor. This tool digests real-time data from Reuters and other market feeds to craft custom trading strategies tailored to user profiles. Looking ahead, the Q3 2025 rollout of AI-Powered Simulated Trading will allow users to test strategies using live data without risking capital. This innovative edge places RCO Finance far beyond the meme-fueled charm of Dogecoin. RCOF’s Binance Path to Millions Dogecoin (DOGE), with its infinite supply and meme roots, faces a cap on investor returns. At its current price, even bullish Q3 2025 targets of $0.55 offer limited upside. Unlike its meme-coin counterparts, RCO Finance is structured for scalability, scarcity, and practical use. With 1.124 billion tokens and a robust burn strategy, its model is geared toward sustained value appreciation. According to predictions, RCOF might hit $2.00 after its Uniswap launch, with the token price currently at $0.16. This represents significant upside for early participants. Upcoming listings on major exchanges and backing from a prominent ChatGPT-linked investor are expected to further accelerate adoption. Don’t Miss RCOF’s Last Presale Shot Time is running out. RCOF presale has already drawn $31 million and continues to attract a growing wave of investor interest. With Big Tech billions and Binance looming, Dogecoin’s meme fades against RCOF’s AI-DeFi revolution. Don’t wait. Stake now. Ignite your wealth.

44260542,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157699,1746586840,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,UK Crypto Policy: Crucial Clarity on National Reserves,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/uk-crypto-reserves-policy/,"In a move that clarifies the United Kingdom’s position on digital assets, the UK Treasury has firmly ruled out the possibility of establishing national cryptocurrency reserves. This announcement provides crucial insight into the government’s approach to the burgeoning crypto space and signals a distinct path compared to other nations. What Exactly Are National Crypto Reserves, and Why Are Countries Considering Them? Before diving into the UK’s decision, let’s understand what national crypto reserves entail. Conceptually, this would involve a country’s central bank or treasury holding a portion of its foreign exchange reserves or national wealth in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, rather than solely in traditional assets like gold, US dollars, or other fiat currencies. The idea of a government crypto strategy that includes reserves has emerged for several potential reasons: Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset class to traditional reserves. Hedge Against Inflation: Some view Bitcoin as a potential hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Strategic Asset: Accumulating digital assets could be seen as building a strategic position in a future digital economy. Potential for Appreciation: Hoping for long-term value growth similar to other reserve assets like gold. However, the concept is fraught with significant challenges, which likely factored into the UK’s decision. Why is the UK Treasury Saying No to National Crypto Reserves? Speaking at the Financial Times Digital Asset Summit in London, UK Economic Secretary to the Treasury, Emma Reynolds, delivered the definitive statement. According to Decrypt, she explicitly stated the government has no intentions of building a stockpile of cryptocurrencies. Reynolds directly addressed the approach taken by some entities, particularly noting the US government’s handling of seized Bitcoin (which has sometimes involved holding rather than immediate sale). However, she drew a clear line, stating, “We don’t think that’s appropriate for our market.” She elaborated that while the US strategy might be understandable in its context, it simply “does not align with the UK’s direction.” This stance highlights a key difference in how the UK Treasury crypto team views the role of digital assets within the national financial framework. Rather than viewing crypto as a reserve asset to be stockpiled, the UK appears to be focusing on other applications and regulatory frameworks. What Does This Mean for UK Crypto Policy and Innovation? Ruling out national crypto reserves doesn’t mean the UK is ignoring the potential of underlying blockchain technology. Reynolds confirmed that the UK government is actively exploring the potential use of distributed ledger technology (DLT) for issuing sovereign debt. This exploration signals a pragmatic approach: leveraging the efficiency and transparency benefits of DLT for core financial infrastructure, while remaining cautious about the volatility and risks associated with holding cryptocurrencies as a national asset. The focus appears to be on facilitating innovation within a regulated environment, rather than engaging in speculative asset accumulation. This decision reinforces the UK’s broader approach to crypto regulation UK , which aims to balance fostering innovation with ensuring financial stability and consumer protection. It suggests the UK sees its role more as a facilitator and regulator of the crypto ecosystem than as a direct participant in holding volatile digital assets on its national balance sheet. What Are the Challenges of Holding Government Crypto Stockpiles? The UK’s decision not to pursue national crypto reserves likely stems from a careful consideration of the significant challenges involved. These include: Extreme Volatility: The price swings of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are far greater than traditional reserve assets, posing significant risk to national wealth. Security Risks: Storing large amounts of crypto securely is complex and vulnerable to hacks or loss of private keys. Regulatory Uncertainty: The global regulatory landscape for crypto is still evolving, creating unpredictable risks. Public Perception: Holding volatile, often misunderstood assets could be politically challenging and raise questions about fiscal responsibility. Market Impact: Large government purchases or sales could significantly impact already volatile markets. Lack of Clear Use Case: Unlike gold or foreign currency reserves used for trade or stability, the immediate practical use of crypto reserves for government functions is limited. These factors make a strategy of accumulating national crypto reserves a high-risk proposition that the UK government seems unwilling to undertake at this time. Conclusion: A Clear Path for UK Crypto Engagement The statement from the UK Treasury provides welcome clarity on a specific aspect of the nation’s stance on digital assets. By ruling out national crypto reserves while simultaneously exploring DLT for sovereign debt, the UK government is defining a path focused on leveraging the underlying technology for infrastructure improvements and fostering a regulated environment for private sector innovation, rather than engaging in direct cryptocurrency asset management. This approach aligns with the UK’s ambition to be a global hub for financial technology, prioritizing stable and secure integration of new technologies over speculative government investment in volatile assets.

On May 6, Coinbase announced that it is launching a protocol called x402 for instant stablecoin payments directly over the internet communication protocol HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). It allows Application Programming Interface (APIs), apps, and AI agents to transact seamlessly, “unlocking a faster, automated internet economy,” the firm stated . Coinbase said that x402 “is fixing the internet’s first mistake.” The protocol resurrects the experimental HTTP 402 “Payment Required” status code to create a seamless payment system native to the internet. The firm noted that traditional payment rails, such as credit cards, bank transfers and subscriptions, “were built for a pre-internet world.” They’re slow, expensive, geographically limited, and “riddled with manual steps,” it added. However, x402 embeds stablecoin payments directly into web interactions, requiring minimal code integration, and is designed for both humans and AI agents to transact value as easily as exchanging data. x402 payment flow. Source: Coinbase The head of engineering at Coinbase Developer Platform and co-author of the x402 white paper, Erik Reppel, said, “We’re laying the groundwork for an economy run not just by people, but by software — autonomous, intelligent, and always on.” Related: Coinbase sees first crypto transaction between AI agents Gagan Mac, vice president of product management at Circle, said x402 “elegantly simplifies real-time monetization” and unlocks “exciting new use cases like micropayments for AI agents and apps.” Coinbase is launching the new protocol in partnership with AWS (Amazon Web Services), stablecoin issuer Circle, AI company Anthropic and AI-focused proof-of-stake layer-1 blockchain Near Protocol . Big benefits for agentic AI AI agents can achieve economic autonomy by independently transacting without human intervention. The protocol enables AI agents to access paid resources in real-time based on their needs and eliminates dependency on pre-paid credits, API keys, or human-managed accounts. AI agents can also provision and pay for hardware resources in real-time, access specialized data sources through micropayments, and pay other AI systems for services. The x402 protocol essentially transforms AI agents from tools that require constant human interaction into autonomous economic actors that can independently discover, purchase and utilize resources to accomplish their goals. Developers can use the protocol to monetize APIs, create software unlocks and enable metered services that dynamically charge users based on actual resource usage, while content creators can monetize their content without the need for blanket subscriptions or credit card minimums and fees.

According to Avery, this kind of calculated buying, often used by institutions to reduce price impact, could be in preparation for a spot XRP exchange-traded fund. When asked why ETF hype isn’t already driving prices higher, Avery responded that the impact may be “more gradual” over time.

In Q1, XRP outperformed Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ), rallying nearly 50% in early February, according to Ripple’s latest report . The XRP/BTC ratio rose 10%, and XRP investment products attracted $37.7 million in inflows, just shy of Ethereum’s $214 million year-to-date. A leveraged XRP ETF launched in April, and spot ETF filings from Franklin Templeton and Bitwise are pending approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Ripple has also settled its long-running SEC lawsuit with a $50 million payment, but the market reaction has been subdued, potentially because it was already priced in. While the fundamentals point to long-term potential, the technical picture remains mixed. On the bullish side, XRP has defended key support around $2.05 and remains above the 200-day estimated moving average near $1.99. Momentum indicators such as the stochastic relative strength index show oversold conditions. XRP price analysis. Credit: crypto.news A move toward the $2.30–$2.40 range may be possible if there is a clear break above the 10-day and 20-day EMAs, which are at $2.17 and $2.19, respectively. But it’s impossible to overlook the bearish scenario. XRP continues to trade below its short- and mid-term moving averages, and the RSI is neutral at 48.7, showing a lack of strong upward momentum. Momentum and moving average convergence divergence indicators also tilt slightly bearish, suggesting sellers are still active. If XRP loses the $2.05 support level, it risks slipping back toward $1.99 or even lower, which could invalidate the bullish whale accumulation thesis in the short term.

Last around $11 per token, the TRUMP coin price has stabilized just above its 50DMA at $10.50 following a volatile few weeks. Towards the end of April, the Trump coin price doubled from its earlier monthly lows to briefly break back above $16, following US President Trump’s announcement that the top 220 holders of the meme coin would be invited to a White House Gala dinner event. This announcement triggered a major surge in demand for TRUMP , but has also received an intense amount of criticism. Democrat Senator Jon Ossoff recently claimed, in announcing a Gala event for the top 220 TRUMP holders, the President is “selling access”, which could be an impeachable offense. Sen. Jon Ossoff on saying Trump’s conduct has exceeded past standards for impeachment, citing crypto venture. “Oh, I stand by those comments 100%,” he said. “It appears that the president’s business and family are being personally enriched through this cryptocurrency venture.” pic.twitter.com/wfuamlqqJi — Manu Raju (@mkraju) May 5, 2025 Meanwhile, fellow Democrat Senator and arch crypto skeptic Elizabeth Warren has been vocal in criticizing another Trump family crypto endeavor, the launch of the USD1 stablecoin via their DeFi project World Liberty Financial. The Trump family stablecoin surged to 7th largest in the world because of a shady crypto deal with the United Arab Emirates—a foreign government that will give them a crazy amount of money. The Senate shouldn’t pass a crypto bill this week to facilitate this kind of corruption. pic.twitter.com/4is9KgpXQb — Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) May 4, 2025 In wake of a controversy filled few weeks, its no wonder that the TRUMP coin price has slipped back from late April highs in the $16 area to around $11. The next sources of volatility for TRUMP are likely to be related to broader macro themes, such as tomorrow’s FOMC meeting. However, big volatility could be coming on May 22. Could the TRUMP coin price 10x? Why May 22 Could Trigger a 10x Rally (Or Total Collapse) May 22’s TRUMP diner at the White House has the potential to spark significant TRUMP coin price volatility. If the event gets a lot of coverage – perhaps President Trump attends and makes newsworthy comments, or even talks policy – this could trigger FOMO, producing a major TRUMP coin price rally similar to that seen in April. Could TRUMP rally all the way up to $100? Well, if TRUMP coin is suddenly seen as the best vehicle through which to secure access to the President, maybe. After all, that would broaden the coin’s appeal beyond just retail investors, but to business and potentially world leaders who want to get into Trump’s ear. The TRUMP coin price rose above $70 in January following its launch, so nothing should be ruled out. That said, an even bigger risk if a post-event price dump. Trump’s attendance isn’t guaranteed—attendees may get an NFT instead—potentially triggering a sell-off if expectations are unmet. In simpler terms, the Gala dinner could end up being a “sell the news” event. Against the backdrop of a struggling altcoin market, this seems very plausible. The macro backdrop remains difficult for risk assets like meme coins, with the US economy facing upside risks to inflation and downside risks to growth, and the Fed currently not eager to make any major monetary policy shifts as it monitors developments. And with the TRUMP meme coin receiving so much backlash from the Democrats right now, who are using it as part of their excuse to hold up legitimate stablecoin legislation , risks seem tilted to the downside. Investors should expect a lot of two way volatility in the TRUMP coin price in the weeks ahead. Better Alternative to Consider – Solaxy (SOLX) Solaxy (SOLX) , a Layer-2 scaling solution for Solana, has raised over $34 million in its presale, with tokens priced at $0.0017. HyperSpeed Achieved! 33 Million Raised! pic.twitter.com/HgswKcnnVM — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) May 3, 2025 Designed to address Solana’s network congestion and high transaction failure rates—evident during the TRUMP coin launch in January—Solaxy processes transactions off-chain, enhancing speed and reliability. Its interoperability with Ethereum facilitates cross-chain liquidity, and a smart contract audit by Coinsult confirms its security. In contrast, TRUMP coin, currently at $11, faces volatility due to political controversy surrounding its May 22 gala and an impending 800 million token unlock, risking price dilution. Solaxy’s focus on infrastructure and scalability may offer a more stable investment compared to TRUMP’s reliance on speculative sentiment, making it a noteworthy consideration for investors.

He called it “earth-shattering” and “a positive development for the country,” but gave no clear details about what it is. He did say it’s not about trade, which has led to plenty of speculation online. Some people believe the announcement could involve Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. There are rumors it could be about a U.S. government crypto reserve or some kind of support for digital assets. One crypto personality said the news will be “game-changing” and should come before Monday. Trump said, “We have a big announcement to make, not about trade but something else but it’s going to be a truly earth shattering and a positive development for this country and for the people of this country.” Others think the announcement may be about international politics. Online AI assistant Grok shared a few possible options based on current global events. These include a possible ceasefire deal in Gaza that could last five to seven years, a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia that accepts some Russian territorial gains, or a new nuclear deal with Iran in exchange for easing sanctions. All of these would be major steps toward global peace, but none have been confirmed.

44261120,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157817,1746588029,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,NEAR ETF Excitement: Bitwise Submits SEC Filing,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitwise-near-etf-filing/,"Big news is circulating in the cryptocurrency world! Asset management firm Bitwise has taken a significant step towards bringing NEAR Protocol into the mainstream financial landscape by filing an application for a spot NEAR ETF with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This development, initially reported by Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart on X (formerly Twitter), marks a notable moment for the NEAR ecosystem and the broader digital asset market. While the path to approval is often lengthy and complex, the filing itself signals growing interest from established financial players in offering regulated investment products tied to specific cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. What Does a Bitwise NEAR Filing Mean? When Bitwise files an S-1 application with the SEC, it’s essentially submitting a registration statement for a new security – in this case, shares of a proposed exchange-traded fund that would hold NEAR tokens directly. This is the initial formal step in the process for seeking regulatory approval to list and trade the fund on a national securities exchange. Here’s a breakdown of what this entails: Formal Intent: The S-1 filing clearly states Bitwise’s intention to launch a spot NEAR ETF , demonstrating a commitment to creating this investment vehicle. Detailed Disclosure: The application provides extensive information about the proposed fund, including its investment strategy (holding physical NEAR), risk factors, creation and redemption mechanisms, fees, and the parties involved. Beginning of SEC Review: The filing triggers the SEC’s formal review process. This involves regulators examining the application to ensure it complies with securities laws and protects investors. Transparency: The S-1 becomes a public document, allowing investors and the market to scrutinize the proposed fund’s structure and potential implications. This move by Bitwise, a firm already active in the crypto fund space, underscores the increasing demand for regulated and accessible ways to invest in digital assets like NEAR. Why is a Spot NEAR Protocol ETF Significant? The potential launch of a spot NEAR Protocol ETF is significant for several reasons, primarily revolving around bridging the gap between traditional finance and the crypto market: Benefits for Investors and the Market: Accessibility: An ETF allows investors to gain exposure to NEAR through traditional brokerage accounts, eliminating the need to set up crypto wallets, manage private keys, or navigate cryptocurrency exchanges. Liquidity: ETFs trade on major stock exchanges, offering high liquidity and ease of buying and selling shares throughout the trading day. Familiarity: The ETF structure is well-understood by traditional investors and financial advisors, potentially attracting capital from individuals and institutions who are hesitant to invest directly in crypto. Regulatory Clarity (Post-Approval): An approved SEC-regulated ETF operates under stringent oversight, potentially offering investors a greater sense of security and trust compared to unregulated avenues. Potential for Increased Demand: Institutional investors, such as pension funds and wealth managers, often have mandates that restrict them from holding direct cryptocurrency but allow them to invest in regulated ETF products. A SEC NEAR ETF could unlock significant institutional capital. Potential Challenges and Considerations: SEC Approval Process: The SEC’s review is rigorous and can take months, involving multiple rounds of questions and amendments to the S-1 filing. Approval is not guaranteed. Market Volatility: While the ETF structure provides accessibility, the underlying asset (NEAR) remains subject to significant price volatility inherent in the crypto market. Fees: ETFs charge management fees, which can impact overall investment returns compared to direct ownership (though direct ownership has its own costs and complexities). Competition: If approved, a NEAR ETF would compete with other potential crypto investment products and direct NEAR ownership. The filing for a Bitwise NEAR ETF joins a growing list of applications for single-asset crypto ETFs, following similar efforts for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. This trend suggests a broader push within the asset management industry to offer diverse regulated crypto exposure. How Does This Relate to Other Crypto ETF Developments? The filing for a NEAR Protocol ETF comes after significant developments in the broader Crypto ETF landscape, particularly the approval and successful launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. earlier this year. The SEC’s approval of Bitcoin ETFs set a precedent and demonstrated a potential shift in regulatory comfort with spot crypto products. Here’s a brief comparison: Feature Spot Bitcoin ETFs (Approved) Proposed Spot NEAR ETF (Under Review) Underlying Asset Bitcoin (BTC) NEAR Protocol (NEAR) Current Status Approved and Trading S-1 Application Filed, Under SEC Review Precedent Set the precedent for spot crypto ETFs in the U.S. Builds on the precedent, tests SEC’s stance on altcoin ETFs Focus Largest and most established cryptocurrency Focus on a specific, prominent layer-1 blockchain protocol While the Bitcoin ETF approvals provide a hopeful backdrop, the SEC’s approach to approving ETFs for other cryptocurrencies is not guaranteed and will likely involve careful consideration of each asset’s market structure, regulatory status, and potential for manipulation. What’s Next for the Bitwise NEAR ETF Application? The S-1 filing is just the beginning. The application will now go through a formal review process with the SEC. This process typically involves: Public Comment Period: The SEC will solicit public comments on the proposed rule change required to list the ETF shares. SEC Questions and Amendments: SEC staff will likely issue comments and questions to Bitwise regarding the filing, requiring amendments to the S-1. Decision Deadlines: The SEC has specific deadlines to make decisions on such filings, although these deadlines can often be extended. The outcome of this application will be closely watched by the crypto community and traditional finance alike. An approval would not only be a significant win for NEAR Protocol but could also pave the way for ETFs tracking other individual cryptocurrencies, further integrating the digital asset market into traditional investment vehicles. Actionable Insights for Investors and NEAR Enthusiasts For those interested in NEAR Protocol or the broader crypto market, this filing offers several key takeaways: Stay Informed: Follow news from Bitwise, the SEC, and reputable financial news sources for updates on the application’s progress. Bloomberg analysts like James Seyffart are valuable resources for tracking these filings. Understand the Product: If approved, understand that a NEAR ETF is a regulated financial product traded on stock exchanges. Research its structure, fees, and risks before investing. Evaluate NEAR Protocol: An ETF filing doesn’t change the fundamentals of NEAR Protocol itself. Continue to research the technology, ecosystem, and development progress of NEAR independently. Consider Market Impact: While an ETF could bring increased demand, the price of NEAR will still be influenced by broader market trends, regulatory news, and project-specific developments. The filing by Bitwise is a strong signal of increasing institutional interest in NEAR Protocol. It represents a potential future avenue for investors to access NEAR through a familiar and regulated wrapper. Conclusion: A Promising Step for NEAR’s Integration Bitwise’s S-1 filing for a spot NEAR ETF is undoubtedly a significant and exciting development for the NEAR Protocol ecosystem and the broader cryptocurrency investment landscape. While the regulatory path ahead involves hurdles and no outcome is guaranteed, this formal step by a reputable asset manager like Bitwise highlights the growing maturation of the crypto market and the increasing demand for regulated investment products. The potential approval of a SEC NEAR ETF could unlock new avenues for institutional and retail investors alike, potentially increasing liquidity and adoption for NEAR. As the SEC reviews the application, the market will be watching closely to see if NEAR will be the next cryptocurrency to gain a regulated ETF vehicle in the United States.

In a significant move for the cryptocurrency and fintech world, Strike, the popular Bitcoin Lightning-based payments application founded by Jack Mallers, has officially entered the lending space. This isn’t just any lending; they’re launching a new Bitcoin-backed lending program, allowing both individual and corporate accounts to borrow funds using their Bitcoin holdings as collateral. This development is poised to offer a fresh avenue for accessing liquidity without requiring users to sell their precious Bitcoin. What is Bitcoin-Backed Lending and Why Does it Matter? Before diving into Strike’s specific offering, let’s quickly cover the concept of Bitcoin-backed lending . At its core, it’s a financial service that allows Bitcoin holders to borrow traditional currency (like USD) by pledging their Bitcoin as security. Think of it like getting a mortgage or a car loan, but instead of real estate or a vehicle, your collateral is your Bitcoin. Why would someone do this? The primary motivation is often to access liquidity without triggering a taxable event by selling their Bitcoin. If you believe your Bitcoin will appreciate further, selling it to cover immediate expenses or investments means losing potential future gains and incurring capital gains taxes. Lending against it allows you to get the cash you need while still maintaining ownership and exposure to Bitcoin’s potential upside. Exploring the Strike Lending Program Details Strike’s new program, initially rolling out in select regions across the U.S., brings this concept to their user base. According to reports from The Block, here are the key details: Loan Amounts: The program targets significant borrowers, offering loans ranging from a minimum of $75,000 up to $2 million. This indicates a focus on high-net-worth individuals or businesses rather than smaller retail loans. Loan Term: Loans are structured with a fixed 12-month term. This provides clarity on the repayment timeline for borrowers. Annual Percentage Rate (APR): The loans come with a minimum 12% APR. Borrowers need to factor this interest cost into their financial planning. Collateral Asset: Exclusively uses Bitcoin (BTC) as the required collateral. Availability: Currently limited to specific U.S. regions, with potential expansion expected later. This structure suggests Strike is entering the market with a focused, potentially more conservative approach compared to some other players in the broader crypto lending space, especially concerning the fixed term and minimum loan size. The Power of Bitcoin Collateral Using Bitcoin collateral for a loan is a double-edged sword, but for many Bitcoin holders, the benefits outweigh the risks, provided they understand the mechanics. Here’s why it’s powerful: Accessing Capital Without Selling: As mentioned, this is the biggest draw. You get the cash you need for investments, business expenses, or personal use without liquidating your Bitcoin holdings. Maintaining Bitcoin Exposure: You continue to hold your Bitcoin, meaning you benefit if its price increases during the loan term. Potential Tax Advantages: Borrowing against an asset is generally not a taxable event, unlike selling the asset for a gain. ( Note: Always consult with a tax professional regarding your specific situation. ) Speed and Simplicity (Potentially): Crypto-backed loans can sometimes be approved faster than traditional loans, although the process for Strike’s program is yet to be fully detailed publicly regarding speed. However, the volatility of Bitcoin means using it as collateral introduces significant risk. This is where understanding the terms, particularly the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio and potential margin calls, becomes crucial. Potential Benefits of Strike Lending for Users For the target audience – likely high-net-worth individuals and businesses – Strike’s entry into Strike lending offers several potential advantages: Firstly, it leverages Strike’s existing infrastructure and reputation. Users familiar with Strike’s payments app might find the lending service a natural extension. The integration within the Strike ecosystem could potentially streamline the process. Secondly, it provides a regulated on-ramp for obtaining liquidity against Bitcoin in select U.S. regions. Operating within regulatory frameworks is often a priority for larger borrowers. Thirdly, the fixed 12-month term provides predictability. Borrowers know exactly when the loan is due, which can help in financial planning, especially for business use cases. Understanding the Risks in Crypto Lending While the benefits are clear, anyone considering crypto lending , including Strike’s new program, must be fully aware of the risks involved. The primary risk stems directly from using a volatile asset like Bitcoin as collateral. 1. Bitcoin Price Volatility: This is the most significant risk. If the price of Bitcoin drops substantially, the value of your collateral decreases. Lending platforms use a Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio to manage this risk. If the LTV ratio (Loan Amount / Collateral Value) exceeds a certain threshold due to a price drop, you will likely face a margin call. 2. Margin Calls: A margin call occurs when the value of your collateral falls below the required level. The platform will require you to add more Bitcoin collateral or repay a portion of the loan to bring the LTV back within acceptable limits. Failing to meet a margin call can result in the forced liquidation (selling) of your Bitcoin collateral by the lender to cover the loan balance. This is the worst-case scenario, as you lose your Bitcoin at a potentially unfavorable price. 3. Interest Rate Risk: While Strike’s initial APR is stated as a minimum, potential changes in market conditions could influence future offerings or the overall cost of borrowing. 4. Platform Risk: Although Strike is a known entity, using any platform involves counterparty risk. Borrowers entrust their collateral to the platform. These risks highlight the need for borrowers to maintain a careful watch on the price of Bitcoin and have a plan in place to address potential margin calls. Who is This Program For? Insights from Jack Mallers Strike Given the minimum loan amount of $75,000, Strike’s program is clearly targeting a specific demographic. This isn’t designed for someone looking to borrow a few thousand dollars for an emergency. Instead, it’s aimed at: High-Net-Worth Individuals: Individuals with substantial Bitcoin holdings who need access to significant capital for investments, real estate, or other large expenditures without selling their BTC. Businesses: Companies that hold Bitcoin on their balance sheet and need working capital, funds for expansion, or to cover operational costs. This focus aligns with a growing trend of integrating Bitcoin into more traditional financial strategies for larger players. It reflects a vision, potentially driven by Jack Mallers Strike , to bridge the gap between the Bitcoin economy and traditional finance, offering sophisticated financial products built around digital assets. Actionable Insights Before Taking a Bitcoin-Backed Lending Loan Considering a Bitcoin-backed lending loan from Strike or any other provider? Here are some crucial actionable insights: Understand the LTV Ratio: Know the initial LTV and, more importantly, the margin call LTV threshold. Calculate how much the price of Bitcoin needs to drop before a margin call is triggered. Have a Plan for Margin Calls: Decide beforehand how you will handle a margin call. Will you add more collateral, or do you have alternative funds available to repay part of the loan? Monitor Bitcoin Price Constantly: You must actively track the market price of Bitcoin to avoid being caught off guard by a margin call. Assess Your Need for Liquidity: Is this loan truly necessary? Could you obtain funds through traditional means? Compare the costs and risks. Read the Terms and Conditions Carefully: Pay close attention to interest rates, fees, repayment terms, and the liquidation process. Consult a Financial Advisor: Especially for large loan amounts, getting professional financial advice is highly recommended. The Broader Impact on Bitcoin and Finance Strike’s launch of a Bitcoin-backed lending program is more than just a new product offering; it’s a signal of the maturing Bitcoin ecosystem. It demonstrates that Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed not just as a speculative asset, but as a legitimate form of collateral that can be used in sophisticated financial products. This could pave the way for more institutional and corporate adoption, as it provides tools for managing liquidity without divesting from Bitcoin holdings. While other platforms offer similar services, Strike’s move is noteworthy due to its focus on the Lightning Network for payments and its prominent role in advocating for Bitcoin adoption. Expanding into lending adds another layer to its financial services suite, positioning Strike as a more comprehensive financial platform in the future. Conclusion: A Powerful New Tool, But Proceed with Caution Strike’s foray into Bitcoin-backed lending represents a powerful new opportunity for Bitcoin holders, particularly businesses and high-net-worth individuals, to access significant liquidity without selling their assets. Leveraging Bitcoin collateral allows users to potentially benefit from future price appreciation while meeting current financial needs. However, like all forms of crypto lending , it comes with inherent risks, most notably the volatility of Bitcoin and the potential for margin calls and liquidation. Understanding these risks and having a clear strategy is paramount. As Jack Mallers Strike continues to build out its financial ecosystem, this lending program marks a significant step in making Bitcoin a more functional and integrated part of the broader financial world.

For those in the cryptocurrency space, who often value pseudonymity and decentralized communication, this presents unique challenges. The recent uproar on Reddit highlights a growing concern: how do we ensure genuine human interaction in the face of increasingly sophisticated AI bots? This incident is pushing Reddit towards implementing new measures, specifically focusing on Reddit verification , which could significantly impact user experience and privacy expectations. The Invasion of AI Bots on Reddit The catalyst for Reddit’s impending changes was a large-scale experiment that saw a swarm of AI-powered bots infiltrate the ‘Change My View’ subreddit. These bots were designed to mimic human users convincingly, posting over 1,700 comments and adopting diverse, sometimes controversial, personas. The goal was to test AI’s persuasive capabilities. For Reddit, a platform built on the premise of real people sharing real opinions, this was a serious threat to its core identity and trustworthiness. The company condemned the experiment, calling it ‘improper and highly unethical’. The presence of advanced AI bots isn’t just a nuisance; it risks degrading the quality of discourse and making it difficult for users to trust the information they encounter. This is particularly relevant in fast-moving spaces like cryptocurrency, where accurate, human-driven insights are crucial. Why Reddit Verification is Becoming Necessary Reddit’s decision to explore stricter verification stems directly from the threat posed by these advanced AI impersonators and evolving regulatory pressures. CEO Steve Huffman indicated that the platform would begin working with third-party services to verify user humanity. This marks a significant shift for Reddit, which has historically allowed users to create accounts with minimal personal information. The core reasons driving this change include: Maintaining Authenticity: Protecting the platform’s reputation as a place for genuine human interaction. Combating Manipulation: Preventing bots from being used for spam, misinformation, or political manipulation. Meeting Regulations: Adhering to new laws, particularly those requiring age verification on social media platforms in various locations. While the specifics remain under wraps, this move towards more robust Reddit verification is a direct response to the escalating capabilities of generative AI. The Tension: Online Anonymity vs. Verification Reddit’s historical strength lies in providing a space for online anonymity , allowing users to share sensitive experiences, express unpopular opinions, and engage in discussions they might avoid if their real identity were attached. This anonymity fosters open dialogue and protects users in vulnerable situations. However, the need for verification directly clashes with this foundational principle. The question becomes: how can Reddit verify humanity or age without compromising the anonymity that users value? This is the central challenge the platform faces. Many users fear that any form of verification, even through third parties, could eventually lead to a loss of the protective layer that online anonymity provides. Concerns Over Data Privacy Introducing third-party verification services raises significant concerns about data privacy . These services often require government-issued IDs or other sensitive personal information to confirm identity or age. Sharing this data with social media platforms, even indirectly through partners, carries inherent risks. The fear is that this sensitive information could be vulnerable to data breaches or, more troublingly, be accessed by authorities. The article highlights a stark example involving Meta handing over private messages that led to legal charges, illustrating the potential consequences when platforms hold identifiable information linked to sensitive discussions. Reddit CEO Steve Huffman stated the company would be ‘extremely protective’ of user data and push back against excessive demands, but the risk remains a major point of contention for users who prioritize data privacy . The Future of Social Media Verification Reddit’s planned changes are indicative of a broader trend in social media verification . As AI technology advances and regulatory demands increase, platforms are under pressure to find ways to confirm the identity or humanity of their users. While established methods often involve linking accounts to phone numbers or requiring ID uploads, newer, more speculative technologies like ‘proof of human’ concepts are also being explored. The challenge for all platforms, including Reddit, is to implement effective verification measures that combat bots and comply with regulations without eroding user trust, compromising online anonymity , or jeopardizing data privacy . The outcome of Reddit’s approach will likely set a precedent for how other platforms navigate this complex issue in the age of advanced AI. Conclusion Reddit is at a crossroads, forced to balance its founding principle of anonymity with the urgent need to combat sophisticated AI bots and meet regulatory requirements. The move towards mandatory verification, while necessary to preserve the platform’s authenticity and integrity against AI threats, introduces significant friction for users who rely on online anonymity and are concerned about data privacy . How Reddit implements these changes, and whether they can find a way to verify users without revealing their identities, will be crucial in determining the future character of the platform and serve as a case study for the evolving landscape of social media verification in the age of pervasive AI.

Historically, when both assets rally, Bitcoin tends to outperform — and with gold making fresh highs, analysts believe Bitcoin could be next. Kiyosaki Choose Bitcoin Over Gold and Silver “21 million is 21 million.” That’s the message from Robert Kiyosaki, author of Rich Dad Poor Dad , in a recent post on X. While he owns gold and silver mines, Kiyosaki emphasized that unlike metals, Bitcoin’s supply is permanently fixed at 21 million coins — no central bank or mining firm can produce more. This scarcity, he argues, is what makes Bitcoin the most reliable hedge against inflation, monetary debasement, and global uncertainty. “I can always mine more gold if prices rise,” he said, “but Bitcoin is locked forever.” Gold Hits $3,500 — Will Bitcoin Follow? Gold surged to $3,500 in April before cooling to $3,237 as of May 5 — still a 33% gain YTD. Bitcoin, meanwhile, has remained flat with just a 0.82% rise this year. But this may be the calm before a breakout. Crypto analyst Cryptollica points to historical patterns: from March 2020 to March 2022, gold rose 35.5%, while Bitcoin soared over 1,100%. If a similar trend plays out, BTC could rally to $155,000, especially if it breaks its current resistance range. Fed Rate Decision Could Be the Trigger The upcoming U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate decision is another catalyst. Despite Donald Trump pushing for a rate cut, the CME FedWatch Tool shows a 97% probability the Fed will keep rates steady this week. However, if policy shifts in the second half of 2025, it could unleash a wave of liquidity — boosting both gold and Bitcoin. Why It Matters Scarcity narrative is fueling long-term Bitcoin confidence. Gold is up 33% YTD , while Bitcoin is still consolidating . Kiyosaki joins a growing chorus of investors positioning BTC as a safer, inflation-resistant asset. Kiyosaki’s endorsement is more than just hype — it taps into Bitcoin’s core value proposition.

Recently, Arvind Krishna, the CEO of IBM, voiced a strong opinion that resonates across the tech sector: federal investment in AI research and development needs to grow, not shrink. Speaking in an interview with Bitcoin World, Krishna made his position clear, especially concerning current proposals impacting Federal AI Funding . Why is the IBM CEO AI Concerned About Funding Cuts? Arvind Krishna, like many prominent figures in technology, sees robust federal investment as fundamental to national competitiveness and technological advancement. “We have been an extremely strong advocate — and this is both the company and me personally — on that federally funded R&D should be increased,” Krishna stated. This is not just a corporate stance but a personal conviction, emphasizing the unequivocal belief that more government investment in R&D is crucial for the future. The concern stems from proposed budget cuts by the Trump administration. These proposals target significant reductions in federal grantmaking and scientific research programs, a departure from previous policy approaches. Key offices focused on AI research, such as the Directorate for Technology, Innovation, and Partnerships (TIP) within the National Science Foundation (NSF), have already faced steep budget reductions. Staffing cuts are also impacting institutions like the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the NSF itself. The Impact on AI R&D Funding The proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 includes calls to significantly cut the NSF’s funding, targeting billions of dollars currently awarded to AI R&D projects. Other federal agencies that contribute substantially to AI research, such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Department of Energy (DOE), also face potential cuts. Beyond direct research funding, there are threats to programs like the CHIPS Act, designed to boost domestic semiconductor production critical for AI technologies. The office responsible for managing CHIPS Act funds saw significant restructuring recently. These potential reductions are viewed with alarm by the tech industry. Groups like The Software and Information Industry Association (SIIA) have formally warned that these cuts could severely hobble America’s global leadership position in AI. This isn’t just about academic research; federally funded research has a proven track record of yielding high economic returns. According to the U.S. Joint Economic Committee, the annual return on federally funded research is estimated at 25-40%, a figure that compares favorably to returns from top-tier venture capital funds (15-27%). Investing in AI R&D Funding is not just about science; it’s about economic strategy. Protecting US AI Leadership Krishna highlighted the broader economic and competitive implications. “We believe that [federal R&D funding] right now [is] happening at close to historic lows in terms of percentage of GDP,” he told Bitcoin World. He argued that increasing federally funded R&D has a profoundly positive effect on the economy, stimulating growth, enhancing the competitiveness of the United States on the global stage, and fostering the development of technologies essential for the future. Maintaining US AI Leadership requires sustained, significant investment. Challenges from Government AI Policy Shifts While advocating for increased funding, IBM has also experienced the direct impact of shifting Government AI Policy and budget priorities. During their Q1 earnings call in April, IBM reported the cancellation of 15 federal contracts, representing $100 million in future revenue. While federal contracts constitute a relatively small portion of IBM’s overall business (between 5% and 10% of its consulting practice), these cancellations illustrate the tangible effects of government spending adjustments on even large corporations. Despite these challenges, Krishna expressed optimism about the future. He believes that the importance of R&D funding for critical technologies like AI, quantum computing, and semiconductors will lead to a positive correction. “I expect that in a year federally funded R&D for AI, for quantum, for semiconductors — I expect it to be in as good or in a better shape than it is today,” Krishna stated, suggesting a potential turnaround in funding levels. Summary: The Urgent Need for AI Investment The message from IBM CEO Arvind Krishna is clear and aligns with warnings from across the tech industry: cutting federal funding for AI R&D is detrimental to America’s economic future and global standing. While facing immediate impacts from budget shifts, there remains hope that policymakers will recognize the high returns and strategic importance of investing in foundational research and development. Sustained Federal AI Funding is seen not just as a government expense, but as a vital investment in innovation, competitiveness, and the future of technology.

Several on-chain metrics appear to support Coinvo’s assessment, as ETH accumulation addresses continue to stack the digital asset despite lackluster price performance over the past few years. Ethereum May Be Due A Rally Soon Although ETH has risen 8% over the past two weeks, it remains down 43% over the past year, trading around $1,700 at the time of writing. From its all-time high (ATH), Ethereum is down 63.6%, in stark contrast to Bitcoin (BTC), which is trading just 13.7% below its ATH. Related Reading: Ethereum Capitulation Nearing Its End? Key On-Chain Metric Reveals Insights Ethereum’s relatively poor performance compared to other major cryptocurrencies has raised questions about its long-term outlook. While Bitcoin benefits from its first-mover advantage and broader institutional adoption, Ethereum faces increasing competition from rival smart contract platforms like Solana (SOL), SUI, and Polkadot (DOT). Despite prevailing negative sentiment, some analysts believe ETH could be on the verge of a turnaround. Coinvo, for instance, claims that Ethereum is significantly undervalued and could be poised for a massive rally. The trader shared the following chart leveraging the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Z-score – a metric used to identify potential market tops and bottoms. According to the chart, Ethereum’s MVRV Z-score has now entered the green zone – between 0 and -1 – a range that historically signals a market bottom and possible trend reversal. Meanwhile, inflows into Ethereum accumulation addresses have surged to historic highs. In an X post, analyst CryptoGoos shared a chart showing record ETH inflows into these addresses in 2025. ​​High inflows to accumulation addresses indicate that long-term investors are actively buying and holding ETH, even during market downturns. This behavior often reflects growing confidence in Ethereum’s future value and suggests a potential bullish sentiment building beneath the surface. In a separate post, CryptoGoos also highlighted that Ethereum’s exchange reserves are at a multi-year low. Diminishing reserves on exchanges point to reduced selling pressure and a tightening supply, which could strengthen ETH’s scarcity narrative and drive prices higher in the near term. ETH Holders Not ‘Bullish Enough’ Noted analyst Crypto Rover drew parallels between ETH’s current price action and BTC’s 2021 trajectory. According to the analyst, if Ethereum mirrors Bitcoin’s past performance, it may be on track to reach a new ATH in the coming months.

The price is now facing resistance near $2.1650 and struggling to continue higher. XRP price started a recovery wave from the $2.080 zone. The price is now trading below $2.170 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2.160 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start another increase if there is a close above the $2.1680 resistance. XRP Price Recovery Could Fade XRP price started a downside correction below the $2.20 and $2.150 levels, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price even declined below the $2.120 level before the bulls appeared. A low was formed at $2.0780 and the price is now correcting losses. There was a move above the $2.10 and $2.120 levels. The price cleared the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.2579 swing high to the $2.078 low. However, the bears are active near the $2.1650 zone. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2.160 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading below $2.170 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.160 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.1680 level and the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.2579 swing high to the $2.078 low. The next resistance is $2.20. A clear move above the $2.20 resistance might send the price toward the $2.220 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.250 resistance or even $2.30 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.320. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.160 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.120 level. The next major support is near the $2.080 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.080 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.050 support. The next major support sits near the $2.020 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $2.120 and $2.080.

Bitcoin Breaks $97K Amid U.S. Tariff Shift,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-is-crypto-up-today-bitcoin-breaks-97k-amid-u-s-tariff-shift/,"The post Why Is Crypto Up Today? Bitcoin Breaks $97K Amid U.S. Tariff Shift appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is witnessing a powerful breakout as Bitcoin crosses the $97,000 mark , fueling a broad-based rally across digital assets. In the past 24 hours, the global crypto market cap surged by 1.64% to $2.98 trillion , driven primarily by bullish momentum in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin exploded by over $3,500 within hours to hit $97,469 , triggering $55 million in short liquidations . The surge was backed by $24.27 billion in trading volume , with Bitcoin now commanding 64% of the total market dominance . Its Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains at a healthy 66, indicating strong buyer interest without entering overbought territory. Why Crypto is Surging? One major catalyst is the renewed optimism over global trade . The U.S. government announced it is restarting trade negotiations with 18 countries—excluding China . Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed the move, which markets interpreted as a step toward easing economic tensions. The update sparked a short-lived risk rally , contributing to Bitcoin’s squeeze higher. This tariff news indicates a potential shift in U.S. trade policy under Donald Trump’s influence, as he continues pushing for lower interest rates and friendlier economic terms. Government Adoption Boosts Sentiment Institutional interest hit a new high as New Hampshire became the first U.S. state to approve crypto investments for its treasury . Governor Kelly Ayotte signed a bill allowing the state to allocate funds to top-tier digital assets like Bitcoin, marking a new era of state-level crypto adoption . Adding to the bullish tone, Binance founder CZ predicted Bitcoin could hit $500K to $1M this cycle . He cited growing ETF flows, government accumulation, and sovereign adoption by countries like El Salvador and Bhutan as reasons for the upside potential. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Robert Kiyosaki Says Bitcoin Is the Better Investment Not Gold or Silver , Altcoins and Meme Coins Ride the Wave While Bitcoin leads the charge, altcoins are tagging along: Ethereum rose 1.02% to $1,824 Solana added 0.90% to $145.67 BNB gained 0.58% to reach $602.30 XRP stood out with a 1.44% daily jump and 4.46% weekly rise Smaller-cap tokens like LAYER and ALPACA saw explosive 30% gains, while meme coins such as GORK and Fartcoin posted eye-catching spikes on decentralized platforms.

ADA Recovery Could Fade Soon,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/ada/cardano-bounce-losing-strength-ada-0-6850/,"Cardano price started a recovery wave from the $0.6420 zone. ADA is now facing resistance near $0.6850 and might decline again. ADA price started a recovery wave from the $0.6420 zone. The price is trading below $0.680 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $0.650 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it clears the $0.6850 resistance zone. Cardano Price Faces Resistance In the past few days, Cardano saw a fresh decline from the $0.730 level, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . ADA declined below the $0.70 and $0.680 support levels. A low was formed at $0.6426 and the price is again moving higher. There was a move above the $0.6550 level. The price cleared the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.7298 swing high to the $0.6426 low. Besides, there was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $0.650 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair. However, the bears are active near the $0.6850 resistance and the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.7298 swing high to the $0.6426 low. Cardano price is now trading below $0.680 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.680 zone. The first resistance is near $0.6850. The next key resistance might be $0.7090. If there is a close above the $0.7090 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $0.730 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $0.750 in the near term. Another Drop in ADA? If Cardano’s price fails to climb above the $0.6850 resistance level, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $0.6630 level. The next major support is near the $0.6500 level. A downside break below the $0.650 level could open the doors for a test of $0.6320. The next major support is near the $0.6175 level where the bulls might emerge. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ADA/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for ADA/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $0.6630 and $0.6500.

Wallets with less than 0.1 BTC sold around 290 BTC, indicating smaller retail investors are either panic selling or selling out of boredom. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen $4.41 billion in inflows since March 26. While larger Bitcoin holders remain confident and continue accumulating the asset, data from a crypto analytics platform shows that smaller retail investors have been shedding BTC amid the asset’s prolonged consolidation below the $100,000 price level. The contrasting behavior between Bitcoin ( BTC ) whales and retail investors often signals that Bitcoin may be heading toward another upward trend, Santiment said in a May 6 X post. Bitcoin smaller players show cold feet “When large wallets gradually accumulate in tandem with retail panic selling/selling out of boredom, it is generally a strong long-term sign of prices biding their time before another breakout,” Santiment said. Bitcoin wallet holders with between 10 and 10,000 BTC have accumulated a combined 81,338 BTC over the past six weeks since March 26. This represents a 0.61% increase in the cohort’s total holdings. Santiment said this could signal a potential retest of the psychological $100,000 price level in the near future. “As May progresses, Bitcoin’s key stakeholders are mostly moving in the right direction if you’re rooting for $100K BTC in the near future,” Santiment said. However, Bitcoin wallets with less than 0.1 BTC sold off approximately 290 Bitcoin over the same period. Since March 26, Bitcoin has traded between $76,273 and $97,210, according to CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin is trading at $96,360 at the time of publication. Source: CoinMarketCap Bitcoin fell below $100,000 on Feb. 1 after US President Donald Trump announced his tariffs and has yet to reclaim that price level . At the time of publication, Bitcoin is trading at $96,360. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETF holders have accumulated over the same period, with US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs totaling $4.41 billion in inflows since March 26, according to Farside data. Bitcoin dominance continues to soar The overall crypto market is still concentrated around Bitcoin. Bitcoin dominance reached 65% on May 6, the highest reading since January 2021, according to TradingView data. Related: Watch these Bitcoin price levels as BTC meets ‘decision point’ At the time of publication, the metric is 65.19%. Meanwhile, CoinMarketCap’s altcoin season index still reads “Bitcoin Season,” indicating the market is favoring Bitcoin over altcoins.

Blockchain security firm CertiK said in a May 6 post to X that the 100 Ether ( ETH ), worth $182,783 at current prices, was moved from a different address initially used in the exploit but can be traced back to the hacker. In March 2022, the exploiter took advantage of a “built-in callback function” in the ERC677 token standard and allowed them to drain the platform’s lending pool through a reentrancy attack , according to CertiK. Source: CertiK After the exploit, Voltage Finance reported that the hacker stole various stablecoins and other crypto, including USDC ( USDC ), Binance USD (BUSD), wrapped Bitcoin ( WBTC ), and Ethereum tokens. The address used by the hacker to get the funds to Tornado Cash had been dormant since November, with the last transaction occurring 166 days ago, Etherscan data shows . In a postmortem of the 2022 exploit, Voltage Finance said the attacker’s address was flagged on Etherscan, and exchanges had been asked to block any transactions. Attempts were also made to contact the attacker and negotiate a bounty to return the funds. Voltage Finance staking pools hit in March exploit Voltage Finance was hit again by another exploit on March 18, when its Simple Staking pools were compromised, the protocol said in a statement posted to X. In total, $322,000 was stolen. In its March 20 postmortem, Voltage Finance said it offered the attacker a bounty of $50,000 to return the funds and had possibly identified a developer who worked on the Simple Staking pools, who may have been involved. “While we haven’t confirmed if he is the hacker, as a precaution, we revoked his access immediately and filed police reports to collaborate with law enforcement and centralized exchanges,” it said. Related: Crypto hackers hit DeFi for $92M in April as attacks double from March Overall crypto losses spiked by 1,163% in April , with the lion’s share coming from a single heist of an elderly US individual’s wallet , after a hacker used advanced social engineering tactics to steal 3,520 Bitcoin ( BTC ), worth $330.7 million. Excluding that attack, April’s crypto losses were $34 million, a 21% jump from March. However, the month also saw over $18 million returned when the hacker behind the $7.5 million exploit of decentralized exchange KiloEx returned all the stolen funds only four days after the attack. The ZKsync Association also recovered $5 million worth of stolen tokens from an April 15 security incident involving its airdrop distribution contract.

44264490,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157950,1746594616,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Hugging Face AI Launches Free, Promising Agent for Computer Automation",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/hugging-face-ai-agent/,"In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, where advancements continually reshape how we interact with technology, a significant development comes from the Hugging Face team. Known for their contributions to open source AI, they have released a new tool that ventures into the realm of computer control. This initiative provides a glimpse into the future of automation, potentially impacting everything from personal workflows to enterprise operations, and aligns with the broader tech trends observed in sectors like cryptocurrency where efficiency and innovation are key. What is the Hugging Face AI Agent? The tool in question is called Open Computer Agent. It’s a cloud-hosted, freely available AI agent designed to operate a virtual computer environment based on Linux. Think of it as an AI assistant that can actually see and interact with a computer screen, much like a human user would. It comes preloaded with applications like Firefox, enabling it to perform web-based tasks. The concept is similar to other emerging tools in the field, such as OpenAI’s Operator. Users can provide Open Computer Agent with a natural language prompt describing a task, and the agent attempts to execute it within the virtual machine. For example, you might ask it to “Use Google Maps to find the Hugging Face HQ in Paris,” and the agent would theoretically open Firefox, navigate to Google Maps, and perform the search steps. Exploring Computer Automation with AI This release is a practical demonstration of computer automation powered by AI. The agent leverages underlying AI models, particularly advanced vision models, to understand what is happening on the screen. According to Aymeric Roucher from the Hugging Face agents team, these models support “grounding,” which is the ability to pinpoint elements on the screen by their coordinates. This capability is crucial as it allows the agent to “click any item” or interact with specific interface elements within the virtual environment. While the technology behind it is complex, the user interaction is designed to be straightforward: you tell the agent what you want done, and it tries to figure out the sequence of actions needed to achieve the goal on the virtual computer. This represents a significant step towards making sophisticated computer use accessible via simple AI commands. Understanding Agentic AI Capabilities In testing, Open Computer Agent handles simple requests reasonably well. Tasks that involve basic navigation or information retrieval within a web browser are often completed successfully. This showcases the foundational Agentic AI capabilities that allow it to interpret commands and translate them into computer actions. However, the current version faces limitations. More complicated tasks, such as searching for specific flight details or navigating complex forms, can still pose challenges. The agent also frequently encounters CAPTCHA tests, which it is currently unable to solve, halting its progress. Furthermore, as a free, cloud-hosted service, user demand means there’s often a virtual queue, adding wait times ranging from seconds to minutes before you can use the agent. The Open Source AI Vision Behind the Tool The Hugging Face team emphasizes that the primary goal of releasing Open Computer Agent wasn’t necessarily to deliver a polished, production-ready product immediately. Instead, it serves as a proof-of-concept and a demonstration of how capable Open source AI models are becoming. They aim to show that complex agentic workflows, which were once the domain of proprietary systems, can now be powered by open models running efficiently on standard cloud infrastructure. This aligns with Hugging Face’s broader mission to democratize AI. By releasing tools and models openly, they encourage experimentation, development, and improvement within the community, pushing the boundaries of what open AI can achieve in areas like computer interaction and automation. The Growing Market for Agentic AI Technology Despite the current limitations of tools like Open Computer Agent, the underlying Agentic AI technology is attracting considerable interest and investment across various industries. Enterprises are increasingly exploring how AI agents can boost productivity by automating repetitive digital tasks, handling customer interactions, or processing information more efficiently. According to a KPMG survey, approximately 65% of companies are already experimenting with AI agents. Market projections further underscore this trend, with Markets and Markets estimating the AI agent segment to grow significantly, from $7.84 billion in 2025 to a projected $52.62 billion by 2030. This indicates strong confidence in the future potential of AI agents to transform workflows and create value. Conclusion: A Promising Step for Open AI Hugging Face’s release of Open Computer Agent is a noteworthy event for the open source AI community and anyone interested in the future of computer automation . While the tool is currently limited by sluggishness, occasional errors, and the inability to handle certain web elements like CAPTCHAs, its existence demonstrates the increasing power and versatility of open AI models. It provides a tangible example of how AI is moving beyond generating text or images to actively interacting with digital environments. As vision models and agentic frameworks continue to improve, the capabilities of tools like Open Computer Agent are expected to grow, paving the way for more sophisticated and reliable AI-powered computer control and automation in the future.

The latest edition highlights a six-day streak of gains in risk-on assets, driven by encouraging signals around potential US trade deals. The report provides in-depth analysis of macroeconomic indicators, spot market activity, and derivative trends across futures, perpetual contracts, and options. It reflects a market lifted by renewed confidence, yet still navigating recent volatility and heightened risk awareness. Key highlights: Perp at Multi-Month High; Traders Remain Cautious After surging from $75,000 to over $95,000 in early April, Bitcoin has been trading sideways near $94,000 this week. Open interest has remained steady for April, hovering near all-time highs at $8 billion, while daily trade volumes have declined to $10 billion. Lower volumes have coincided with reduced realized volatility. Perpetual futures positioning suggests that traders are holding off on major bets, potentially awaiting the next breakout while remaining wary of recent sell-offs. Bitcoin Volatility Drops to 18-Month Low Bitcoin’s volatility has declined toward a key support zone between 35% and 40%—a range from which it has repeatedly rebounded over the past 18 months. Implied volatility has followed suit, dipping in line with a 10-point drop in realized volatility to just above 30%, the lower bound of its 18-month range. Options flows currently show a preference for puts, while the spot price remains stable. The volatility smile skews toward out-of-the-money (OTM) calls for longer-dated options, whereas short-dated options are close to neutral. BTC Volatility Smile Tilts Toward OTM Calls Bitcoin’s volatility smile now favors out-of-the-money (OTM) calls across all tenors, marking a reversal from the put-heavy skew seen earlier in April. Ether shows a similar short-term recovery, although longer-dated skew for ETH remains modestly bearish. Despite positive funding rates for ETH, longer-dated option smiles still lean toward puts, indicating mixed sentiment. In contrast, BTC derivatives markets reflect stronger bullish signals, including positive funding rate spikes, upward-sloping futures curves, and a renewed skew toward OTM calls.

Today’s jump added almost $4,000 to BTC prices in around 12 hours, but the move could not be sustained as the asset fell back to $96,500 at the time of writing. Nevertheless, Bitcoin remains up 2.3% on the day, and sentiment appears to be improving despite the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision on May 7. US-China Trade Talks The move appears to have been driven by the United States and China reportedly planning high-level trade talks in Switzerland over the weekend. Late Tuesday, May 6, China and the US announced plans for trade talks between Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Geneva, reported the Associated Press on May 7. “Thanks to POTUS, the world has been coming to the US, and China has been the missing piece—we will meet on Saturday and Sunday to discuss our shared interests,” said Bessent on X. He added that the current tariffs and trade barriers are “unsustainable,” but we don’t want to “decouple,” we want fair trade. Thanks to @POTUS , the world has been coming to the US, and China has been the missing piece—we will meet on Saturday and Sunday to discuss our shared interests.

What we want is fair trade. pic.twitter.com/MYc4XvqME8 — Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent (@SecScottBessent) May 6, 2025 The Chinese Commerce Ministry confirmed the trade talks between its vice premier and Bessent in Switzerland. “The Chinese side carefully evaluated the information from the US side and decided to agree to have contact with the US side after fully considering global expectations, Chinese interests, and calls from US businesses and consumers,” said a ministry spokesperson. Wendy Cutler, a former US trade official, said it is an “important opportunity to have initial talks on unwinding some tariffs, mapping out a path forward, as well as raising concerns,” cautioning that the process will take time. The meeting comes amid growing US market concern over the impact of the trade tariffs on the prices and supply of consumer goods. Consumers are hurt the most when import tariffs are imposed as the price of goods escalates, adding to economic woes and recession fears. Elsewhere on Crypto Markets Bitcoin and crypto markets have also been boosted by a weakening US dollar as the currency devaluation has accelerated over the past week or so. However, crypto market cap remains flat on the day at $3.08 trillion despite Bitcoin’s gains. Ethereum climbed to an intraday high of $1,845, but it still faces heavy resistance at this level that it has not been able to overcome in the past fortnight. The altcoins were seeing minor gains, with slightly better performance from Cardano, Chainlink, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin , which jumped 10%.

However, recent data surrounding the TRUMP token , a meme coin linked to former President Donald Trump, highlights a particularly stark reality for many investors. While a select few have reaped immense rewards, the vast majority are currently underwater on their investments. Understanding the TRUMP Token Phenomenon The TRUMP token ($TRUMP) emerged as part of the politically-themed meme coin trend. These tokens often gain traction based on social media hype, celebrity endorsements (or associations), and speculative trading rather than underlying technology or utility. While this can lead to explosive price pumps, it also means they are highly susceptible to sudden crashes and manipulation. The Stark Reality: Crypto Losses for the Majority Data shared by blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis paints a clear, albeit grim, picture for holders of the TRUMP token . According to their findings, over 760,000 unique wallets holding the token are currently sitting on unrealized losses. This means the price they acquired the token at is higher than its current market value. Over 760,000 Wallets: A vast number of individual investors are experiencing losses. Majority are Small Investors: The bulk of these losing wallets belong to those who likely invested smaller amounts. Unrealized vs. Realized Losses: These are ‘paper losses’ for now, but become real if the investors sell at the current price. This situation is not entirely uncommon in volatile markets, but the sheer scale of wallets in the red underscores the significant risk associated with tokens driven primarily by speculation and sentiment. Who’s Winning? The Rise of Crypto Whales In stark contrast to the hundreds of thousands of losing wallets, a tiny fraction of holders have seen extraordinary gains. The Chainalysis data revealed that just 58 wallets have each gained over $10 million from their TRUMP token holdings. These large holders, often referred to as crypto whales , typically got in very early – perhaps even at the token’s inception – or made significant purchases during low points. Their ability to hold large positions and potentially influence market movements gives them a distinct advantage in volatile meme coin markets. The disparity between the many small losers and the few large winners is a classic characteristic of speculative bubbles, where early participants and those with significant capital can benefit disproportionately. Why Meme Coin Investment is High-Risk The story of the TRUMP token serves as a potent case study for the inherent risks of meme coin investment . Here’s why these assets are particularly perilous: Extreme Volatility: Prices can skyrocket or plummet based on social media trends, news, or even single large trades. Lack of Intrinsic Value: Unlike cryptocurrencies with technological utility (like Ethereum) or perceived store-of-value properties (like Bitcoin), meme coins’ value is almost entirely based on community hype and speculation. Pump-and-Dump Potential: Large holders or groups can coordinate to artificially inflate the price (‘pump’) and then sell off their holdings rapidly (‘dump’), leaving later investors with worthless tokens. Regulatory Uncertainty: The lack of clear regulation around meme coins makes them fertile ground for scams and manipulation, and investors have little recourse if things go wrong. Insider Advantages: As seen with the TRUMP token, wallets potentially tied to the project’s creators or early insiders can benefit from fees or pre-mine allocations, adding another layer of risk for retail investors. Navigating Meme Coin Risks : Actionable Insights Given the significant meme coin risks , what should potential investors consider? It’s crucial to approach these assets with extreme caution and a clear understanding of the potential downsides. Actionable Insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Understand what you are investing in. For meme coins, this means understanding the community, the tokenomics (how the token is distributed and used), and checking for red flags like highly concentrated ownership. Assume You Could Lose Everything: Only invest what you can comfortably afford to lose. Meme coins are not suitable for capital preservation or reliable growth. Be Wary of Hype: Don’t get swept up in social media frenzy or celebrity endorsements. Look critically at the data and the underlying reality. Understand Tokenomics: Be aware if a large percentage of the supply is held by a few wallets or if insiders benefit significantly from transaction fees or pre-allocations, as this can indicate potential manipulation or unfair advantages. Diversify (Carefully): If you choose to dabble in meme coins, make them a tiny, insignificant part of a much larger, diversified crypto portfolio. Consider Regulatory Scrutiny: Be aware that tokens facing regulatory attention may encounter issues that negatively impact their price or accessibility. The fact that insider wallets tied to the TRUMP token project continue to earn millions in fees, even as most token supply is reportedly locked or held by losing investors, adds a layer of concern and highlights the potential for models that benefit creators over community members. Summary: A Cautionary Tale of Meme Coin Investment The Chainalysis data on the TRUMP token provides a stark illustration of the potential pitfalls in the speculative corners of the crypto market. While a small group of crypto whales have achieved remarkable gains, the overwhelming majority of investors are facing substantial crypto losses . This scenario is a powerful reminder of the inherent meme coin risks , including extreme volatility, lack of fundamental value, and potential for insider advantages. For anyone considering meme coin investment , the data from the TRUMP token should serve as a crucial warning.

Meanwhile, controversy is mounting at the federal level, with President Trump facing bipartisan backlash over his personal involvement in cryptocurrency, including his TRUMP meme coin and a planned gala for major holders. The situation intensified political divisions in Congress, and also stalled crypto legislation as Democrats and Republicans clash over ethics, regulation, and the president’s financial ties to the crypto industry. New Hampshire Takes the Lead in Crypto Adoption New Hampshire officially became the first US state to authorize government investment in cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, after the signing of House Bill 302 into law by Governor Kelly Ayotte. The bill was introduced in January and passed by both chambers of the state legislature. It allows the state treasury to allocate funds into cryptocurrencies and precious metals. However, the legislation limits these investments to digital assets with a market capitalization of more than $500 billion, which effectively narrows the scope to major players like Bitcoin and Ethereum while excluding most smaller tokens and meme coins. Governor Ayotte announced the move on social media on May 6, which signals a new era for state-level crypto adoption. The state’s Republican leadership praised the bill by stating that New Hampshire is setting the pace for integrating digital assets into public financial strategy. The decision puts the ”Live Free or Die” state at the forefront of a growing movement among US states to explore the creation of strategic crypto reserves. This development happened during broader national discussions about the role of cryptocurrency in government financial planning. At the federal level, President Donald Trump issued an executive order earlier this year to establish a “Digital Asset Stockpile” and a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.” Meanwhile, Senator Cynthia Lummis proposed the BITCOIN Act, which suggests that the US government could accumulate over 1 million BTC through seizures tied to criminal and civil forfeiture. The bill is currently under review by the Senate Banking Committee. New Hampshire’s proactive legislation sets it apart from other states that attempted similar moves but failed to secure executive approval. Arizona, for example, passed a similar bill in April, only for it to be vetoed by Governor Katie Hobbs on May 2. Florida also dropped two legislative efforts related to creating a Bitcoin reserve just a day later. As a result, New Hampshire now stands alone in officially embracing crypto as a treasury asset. Crypto Sparks Congressional Clash Although one state is making strides when it comes to embracing crypto, the same cannot be said for the whole of the US. A joint hearing on digital assets in the US House was thrown into political turmoil on May 6 when Representative Maxine Waters, ranking member of the House Financial Services Committee (HFSC), led a group of Democratic lawmakers in walking out. Waters denounced what she called “the corruption of the President of the United States” in relation to cryptocurrency, and called President Donald Trump’s personal crypto holdings and involvement in the industry a serious conflict of interest. Despite her objections, Republican lawmakers, led by digital asset subcommittee Chair Bryan Steil, continued the session by classifying it as a “roundtable,” and skirting certain committee rules that may have otherwise stopped the proceeding. HFSC Chair French Hill urged lawmakers to press ahead with developing a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets, but avoided directly addressing concerns about Trump’s alleged financial entanglements. Waters’ protest was part of a broader strategy that was announced the day prior, which reflects the rising tension over the president’s actions that include launching a meme coin, offering exclusive dinners to major token holders, and maintaining family connections to the crypto firm World Liberty Financial. As Republicans advanced their proposed crypto market structure bill during the roundtable, Democrats held a separate “shadow hearing” where they unveiled draft legislation that would ban the president, vice president, members of Congress, and their immediate families from owning or profiting from cryptocurrencies. The bill will also ban these officials from leading digital asset projects or accepting crypto-based compensation. Legislation proposed by Democrats (Source: House Financial Services Committee Democrats ) The increasingly partisan divide threatens to stall progress on digital asset legislation, including a Senate stablecoin bill that recently lost Democratic support due to allegations of presidential impropriety. Even some Republicans, like Senator Cynthia Lummis and Senator Lisa Murkowski, criticized the Trump family’s involvement in the crypto sector, and Congressman Hill admitted it complicates the path forward for regulation. TRUMP Coin Gala Causes Bipartisan Outrage US President Donald Trump is also facing growing bipartisan backlash over plans to host a gala dinner for top holders of his TRUMP meme coin. On May 5, Trump announced via Truth Social that the dinner will take place on May 22, which only intensified concerns among lawmakers about conflicts of interest and potential corruption. Critics argue that Trump is effectively offering exclusive presidential access in exchange for investment in a digital asset that is tied to his personal brand and business interests. (Source: Truth Social ) Several Democratic lawmakers, including Senators Elizabeth Warren, Adam Schiff, and Jon Ossoff, publicly condemned the initiative. Schiff and Warren co-signed a letter accusing the president of selling privileged access, while Ossoff suggested at a recent town hall that the plan constituted an impeachable offense. Republican lawmakers have not been silent either. Senator Cynthia Lummis also voiced her discomfort with the president using the White House as an incentive for crypto investors. She called the arrangement troubling, even as a supporter of digital assets. To complicate the situation even more is a recent international deal involving a Trump-backed stablecoin, USD1. On May 1, Abu Dhabi-based firm MGX used USD1 to settle a $2 billion investment into Binance. The stablecoin’s market cap surged from roughly $137 million to over $2 billion in 24 hours. Senator Warren called this a “shady crypto deal” with the United Arab Emirates and warned of the national security implications. She called on the Senate to pause all pro-crypto legislation in light of the potential for foreign financial influence over the president. Legal experts are still divided on whether Trump’s actions are actually in violation of any existing statutes. Niko Demchuk from AMLBot pointed out the need for clearer disclosure and conflict-of-interest rules to prevent misuse of digital assets by public officials, while Yarden Noy from DLT Law stated that current regulations may not apply to Trump’s dealings. Noy also pointed to the constitutional prohibition on emoluments, though its applicability in this case is very uncertain. Trump’s conflicting remarks on whether he profited from the TRUMP meme coin only added to the scrutiny. In a clip that was circulated by Warren, Trump seems evasive about his financial involvement by claiming not to have even looked at whether he has profited.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-07 05:27:57

Bitwise has filed to list a spot Near ETF in the US, while 21Shares has launched a Cronos ETP on European exchanges. Bitwise Files for Spot Near ETF, Expanding the SEC’s Growing Altcoin Docket In a May 6 filing , Bitwise outlined its intention to launch the Bitwise Near ETF, which would directly track the price of the NEAR token — the native asset of the Near blockchain network. The fund, structured as a trust, aims to offer exposure to NEAR through a conventional brokerage account, minus fund expenses. Coinbase Custody Trust Company is listed as the proposed custodian for the ETF. Details such as the ETF’s ticker symbol, management fee, and preferred stock exchange have not yet been disclosed. Bitwise’s preliminary filing does not mark the beginning of the SEC’s official review. The company must still submit a 19b-4 form, which will trigger the regulatory countdown and pave the way for a potential decision. Bitwise signaled its intention to move forward with the trust when it registered the fund in Delaware on April 28. Bitwise’s move brings NEAR into an increasingly competitive field of altcoin ETF contenders. The SEC is currently sitting on more than a dozen spot crypto ETF applications for various assets including Litecoin (LTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), Solana (SOL), XRP, Cardano (ADA), Hedera (HBAR), Polkadot (DOT), Chainlink (LINK), Avalanche (AVAX), Aptos (APT), and Sui (SUI). Bitwise itself has filed for spot ETFs tied to DOGE, SOL, and XRP, on top of its already approved Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) spot ETFs, which are listed on NYSE Arca. Since their launch, those flagship funds have collectively attracted $2.35 billion in net inflows, underlining strong institutional and retail demand for regulated crypto exposure. Why Near? Launched in 2020, the Near blockchain was initially hailed as a potential ”Ethereum killer” due to its unique approach to scalability and efficiency. The NEAR token, currently trading around $2.31, powers the layer-1 blockchain and sits at 44th by market cap with a total valuation of approximately $2.73 billion, according to CoinGecko . NEAR price chart (Source: CoinGecko) Near’s claim to fame is its Nightshade sharding architecture, which allows it to process up to 100,000 transactions per second while maintaining low fees and high security. The network is currently maintained by 265 active validators, according to NearBlocks . While Near once focused heavily on decentralized finance (DeFi), the project pivoted in 2024 toward AI infrastructure, with ambitions to build the world’s largest open-source large language model (LLM). This strategic shift aims to position Near as a major player in the convergence of AI and blockchain — two of the fastest-growing sectors in tech. Regulatory Outlook Despite the surge in ETF filings, the SEC has yet to approve any spot ETF for assets outside of Bitcoin and Ether . However, industry analysts view the wave of applications as a sign of growing maturity and demand in the crypto market. While approval timelines remain uncertain, ETF issuers are hoping that the SEC’s greenlighting of Bitcoin and Ethereum products sets a precedent for broader altcoin inclusion. The flood of new applications also signals a deeper philosophical shift within the crypto industry: from speculative assets to regulated investment products, with traditional structures designed to meet institutional compliance standards. 21Shares Launches Cronos ETP in Europe as Altcoin Investment Demand Grows In related news, Swiss-based asset manager 21Shares has introduced a new exchange-traded product (ETP) offering investors regulated exposure to the Cronos (CRO) token, the native asset of the Crypto.com-affiliated blockchain network. The Cronos ETP, announced by 21Shares on May 6, is now available for trading on Euronext Paris and Amsterdam, marking the latest move by the asset manager to expand its European product suite. With this launch, investors can gain exposure to CRO through traditional brokerage platforms and banks — removing the technical barriers of managing crypto wallets or accessing digital asset exchanges. CRO is the native token of the Cronos Chain, a layer-1 blockchain built by Crypto.com and positioned to integrate Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems. It is designed to power applications in decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and broader Web3 infrastructure. According to 21Shares, the ETP will allow institutional and retail investors to participate in the growth of Cronos without directly handling digital assets. ”By launching a Cronos ETP, we are offering investors safe, regulated exposure to a blockchain ecosystem that is driving real-world adoption,” said Mandy Chiu, Head of Financial Product Development at 21Shares. ”This product reflects our mission to bridge traditional finance and the crypto economy.” The ETP is fully collateralized by the underlying CRO tokens, which are securely held in institutional-grade custody solutions. 21Shares has not yet disclosed the product’s expense ratio or ticker symbol. Cronos: Fundamentals and DeFi Footprint The CRO token currently trades at around $0.092, with a market capitalization of $2.3 billion and a fully diluted valuation of nearly $8.7 billion, according to CoinMarketCap . While CRO once gained notoriety for its aggressive marketing via Crypto.com’s sports sponsorships, it has since turned toward ecosystem development and infrastructure. CRO price chart (Source: CoinMarketCap) The Cronos Chain boasts a total value locked (TVL) of approximately $400 million, per DeFiLlama data . Among its key DeFi components is Crypto.com Staked ETH (CETH) — a liquid staking product for Ethereum — which holds roughly $64 million in TVL. As a Cosmos SDK-based chain with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility, Cronos provides a dual advantage: high throughput and composability with the broader Ethereum landscape. This interoperability is central to Cronos’ ambition to become a leading multichain Web3 hub for consumer-facing applications. The launch of the Cronos ETP comes amid a broader trend of rising demand for altcoin-backed investment vehicles. Just a day prior, asset manager VanEck filed to list a BNB ETF in the US — the first proposed US ETF tied to Binance’s native token. In parallel, 21Shares has filed US ETF proposals for a range of altcoins including Dogecoin (DOGE), Polkadot (DOT), and Solana (SOL), seeking to capitalize on the shifting regulatory landscape under the Trump administration. Since January 2025, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has adopted a notably softer stance toward crypto ETFs , following the appointment of new leadership under the Trump presidency. As a result, asset managers are now pursuing regulatory approval for more than 70 crypto-linked ETFs, spanning both mainstream and niche tokens. European Momentum Builds Europe remains a key hub for crypto ETPs, offering a relatively friendlier regulatory environment compared to the US. Firms like 21Shares, ETC Group, and CoinShares have leveraged exchanges in Switzerland, Germany, France, and the Netherlands to offer wrapped exposure to everything from Bitcoin and Ether to more exotic tokens like Uniswap (UNI), Avalanche (AVAX), and now Cronos. The launch of the Cronos ETP may also serve as a signal that investor appetite for exchange-affiliated blockchains is expanding. With CRO, BNB, and other centralized exchange tokens entering the ETF/ETP pipeline, asset managers appear to be betting that these ecosystems — once criticized for their centralized roots — are becoming cornerstones of mainstream blockchain adoption.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|TRADING|CRO,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-07 05:30:00

The asset has dropped by 3% over the past week and 1.6% in the past 24 hours, continuing its broader corrective trend after reaching a cycle high of $4,107 in December 2024. Although price movement has been limited, on-chain data suggests that certain underlying shifts could influence market behavior in the near term. Related Reading: Ethereum Breaks Massive Downtrend Price Structure – Momentum Shift? Ethereum Sees Plunge In Spot Volume CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost has reported that Ethereum’s spot volume is experiencing a consistent decline. His analysis focuses on a bubble chart that visualizes two dimensions: the size of each bubble represents spot volume, and its color indicates the volume change rate. According to the data, the bubbles have become progressively smaller and lighter in color, indicating that fewer trades are being conducted and that the pace of decline in volume is slowing. While declining spot volume may traditionally be viewed as a sign of reduced investor interest or weak momentum, Darkfost interprets it differently in the context of a market correction. He suggests that a decline in spot volume during a downtrend can act as a stabilizing force, potentially reducing the likelihood of sharp volatility spikes caused by large sell orders. Lower volume during a corrective phase could mean that sellers are exhausting their positions or stepping aside, creating conditions for price consolidation. This can ease the intensity of downward pressure and potentially pave the way for a more balanced market structure in the short term. However, Darkfost was cautious in his interpretation, noting that cooling volume doesn’t necessarily mean the market has bottomed out. Instead, it could simply mark a temporary pause in volatility before the next move. Long-Term Holders Increase Exposure Despite Unrealized Losses Meanwhile, in a separate update, CryptoQuant analyst Carmelo Alemán explored Ethereum’s long-term holder behavior and revealed that many ETH investors continue to accumulate, even while sitting in unrealized losses. Accumulation addresses, defined as wallets that consistently receive ETH without significant selling, are generally seen as strong hands with longer investment horizons. According to Alemán, March 10 marked a pivotal moment when the average realized price of accumulation addresses fell below ETH’s market price, pushing these wallets into negative territory. Related Reading: Ethereum Holders Stay Committed Despite Unrealized Losses – Signs Of An Incoming Rally? Despite this, the data shows that accumulating addresses have increased their balances by over 22% between March and early May, growing from 15.5 million ETH to 19 million ETH. This behavior reflects strong conviction and suggests that long-term holders believe Ethereum is undervalued at current prices. Historically, such accumulation during downturns has preceded upward price movements, as reduced supply on the market creates favorable conditions for a rally when demand returns.

For now, XRP remains within a tight range between a key resistance and a critical support line. Recall the developments that took place a month ago when the entire crypto market plunged hard amid the escalating tensions on the Trade War front between the US and essentially the rest of the world. Fast-forward a month, and the political situation seems a lot better, with reports that the US and China plan to meet soon regarding the remaining tariffs. Naturally, crypto prices have reacted to all developments. A month ago, XRP plunged to $1.6 but now sits above $2.1. However, the TD Sequential on the 3-day scale hints at an upcoming correction. The metric, used to showcase an asset’s exhaustion in either direction, has flashed a sell signal, according to popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez. $XRP could be due for a retracement, with the TD Sequential flashing a sell signal on the 3-day chart! pic.twitter.com/onZCDJTusd — Ali (@ali_charts) May 7, 2025 Despite the brief slip below $2 a month ago, XRP has remained predominantly above that level. While some analysts believe that such a price is an ‘absolute gift,’ Martinez has highlighted multiple times how important it is for $2 to remain as support instead of turning into resistance if XRP slips below it. In a separate post today, the analyst with over 135,000 followers on X also outlined the upper boundary in XRP’s current trading range – $2.26. The asset currently sits roughly in the middle of the two lines ($2.14), with no clear indication of the next big move. Martinez said more clarity will come whenever XRP decisively closes below $2 or above $2.26. Key levels to watch for $XRP are $2 and $2.26. A decisive close outside this range could set the tone for the next major trend. pic.twitter.com/GvBd4bFdjj — Ali (@ali_charts) May 6, 2025 The post Critical Warning for Ripple’s (XRP) Price After 30% Monthly Surge: Details appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|XRPBTC|XRPUSD|Ripple (XRP) Price,EN,0,0,ASIA|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-05-07 05:43:52

The announcement came via the company’s X account early Tuesday, stating that “Movement Labs has terminated Rushi Manche’s employment and all affiliations with the company effective immediately.” It has yet to name a replacement or outline next steps for governance restructuring. The decision follows a CoinDesk report that first revealed secret agreements between Movement-linked entities and market makers during the project’s token launch. CoinDesk reported the existence of shadow advisors, hidden payment flows, and undisclosed token allocations surrounding MOVE’s debut. Manche was directly tied to those arrangements, according to internal documents and investor correspondence reviewed by CoinDesk. Manche was initially suspended on May 2, shortly after Coinbase delisted the MOVE token. The delisting followed mounting community pressure on how the company operates behind-the-scenes and project governance. MOVE prices are down 8.5% in the past 24 hours, a bulk of the slide coming after Manche’s termination.

Ethereum schedules Prague fork containing several EIPs Ethereum previously announced that the Prague fork was also scheduled to occur on the mainnet at block timestamp ‘Wed May 07 10:05:11 2025 UTC’. The fork will contain several EIPs, including EIP-2537, which will add operation on the BLS12-381 curve as a precompile in a set necessary to efficiently perform operations such as BLS signature verification. EIP-2935 will store and serve the last 8191 block hashes as storage slots of a system contract to allow for stateless execution. At the same time, EIP-6110 will provide validator deposits as a list of deposit operations added to the Execution Layer block, and EIP-7002 will allow validators to trigger exits and partial withdrawals via their execution layer (0x01) withdrawal credentials. EIP-7251 will also increase the MAX_EFFECTIVE_BALANCE, allowing validators to have larger effective balances while maintaining the 32 ETH lower bound. EIP-7549 will move the committee index outside the ‘signed attestation message,’ and EIP-7623 will increase call data cost to reduce maximum block size. EIP-7685 will include a general-purpose bus for sharing execution layer (EL) triggered requests with the consensus layer (CL), and EIP-7691 will increase the number of blobs to reach a new target and max of 6 and 9 blobs per block, respectively. Also, EIP-7702 will add a new tx type to permanently set the code for an EOA, while EIP-7840 will include per-fork blob parameters in client configuration files. Notably, transaction-sending RPCs will now add txs to the ‘locals’ tracker only when they have any chance of inclusion, which will be a bit of a revert from the behavior added in ‘Multicapacitor v1.15.4’–where APIs such as ‘eth_sendRawTransaction’ would always return a txhash, even if the transaction was not includable on-chain.

This development underscores the growing intersection between prominent political figures and the evolving landscape of crypto finance. What Trump Crypto Assets Were Involved? According to on-chain analysis by Spot On Chain, World Liberty Financial moved approximately $4.51 million worth of various crypto tokens. The transfer, completed within a 45-minute window, involved three distinct cryptocurrencies: AVAX: 103,911 tokens, valued at approximately $2.06 million at the time of transfer. MOVE: 7.58 million tokens, valued at roughly $1.27 million. SEI: 5.98 million tokens, valued at about $1.18 million. This diverse portfolio move highlights activity beyond just the major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, indicating engagement with a broader range of altcoins. Where Did World Liberty Financial Send the Funds? The transferred assets were sent to a new wallet address. While the exact ultimate destination is not definitively confirmed, analysis suggests the funds are likely heading towards Ceffu. Ceffu is an institutional-grade custody solution affiliated with Binance, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. Moving funds to an institutional custodian like Ceffu often signals a strategic decision related to security, management, or preparing for potential future transactions or services that require secure, compliant storage. Understanding the AVAX, MOVE, and SEI PnL On-chain data also provides insight into the unrealized Profit and Loss (PnL) associated with these specific holdings prior to the transfer. The results were mixed, illustrating the volatile nature of crypto investments: Unrealized PnL Breakdown: Asset Unrealized PnL AVAX +$69,900 MOVE -$2.45 million SEI +$196,000 While the AVAX and SEI holdings showed modest unrealized gains, the MOVE position represented a significant unrealized loss. It’s important to note that these figures represent unrealized PnL at the time of the transfer; the actual profit or loss would only be realized if the assets were sold. Why Does This Crypto Transfer Matter? This transaction is noteworthy for several reasons: Political Figure Involvement: It provides further evidence of direct or indirect involvement of entities linked to prominent political figures like Donald Trump in the cryptocurrency space. Institutional Adoption Signal: The potential move to Ceffu suggests a preference for institutional-level security and custody solutions, which is often seen as a step towards more mature and secure management of digital assets. Portfolio Insight: The specific tokens moved (AVAX, MOVE, SEI) offer a glimpse into the types of assets held by World Liberty Financial, going beyond just the most common cryptocurrencies. Market Interest: Any significant crypto movement tied to a high-profile name generates considerable interest and speculation within the crypto community. While the exact reasons behind this specific transfer remain undisclosed, moving a substantial amount of assets to a new, likely institutional wallet, is a significant operational step. It could be related to portfolio restructuring, enhanced security measures, or preparation for future strategic actions involving these digital assets. Conclusion: A Glimpse into High-Profile Crypto Holdings The $4.5 million crypto transfer by Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial involving AVAX, MOVE, and SEI tokens to a new wallet, potentially destined for Ceffu, offers a fascinating insight into the digital asset activities of entities connected to high-profile figures. The mixed unrealized PnL figures highlight the inherent volatility of the market, even for large holdings. This event serves as another data point demonstrating the increasing presence and strategic asset management within the cryptocurrency ecosystem by a diverse range of participants, including those with ties to traditional political and financial spheres.

Here’s What the Math Says appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News There’s a lot of talk online about XRP possibly reaching huge price levels like $100, $500, or even $1,000. While that might sound far-fetched at first, some real-world use cases and numbers suggest it may not be so crazy after all. An X (formerly Twitter) account by the name Stellar Rippler pointed out that XRP was designed to handle fast, low-cost cross-border payments—something the current SWIFT system handles at a rate of about $5 trillion per day. If XRP eventually takes over even 10% of SWIFT’s volume, that’s $500 billion daily. With that kind of flow, XRP’s price could climb to somewhere between $27 and $50. Another scenario is around Nostro and Vostro accounts, where banks keep about $27 trillion locked up just to settle international payments. If XRP can replace even 5% of this, it could unlock a huge amount of capital, possibly pushing XRP’s price to $80–$100. Then there’s the possibility that Ripple becomes a licensed bank. If that happens, it could offer lending, custody, and payment services directly—using XRP as its backbone. That kind of shift could easily push XRP over $100. (9/ ) Bitcoin went from pennies to $100K+ on narrative alone. No partnerships. No institutional rails. Just belief. XRP has real-world utility, banking ties, regulatory positioning, and tech light-years ahead… And people still think $10+ is a dream? It’s not a question of if -… pic.twitter.com/gabvDd5sae — Stellar Rippler (@StellarNews007) May 6, 2025 Ripple is also already working with more than 40 central banks. If XRP becomes the main bridge currency for central banks, big financial groups like the IMF or World Bank might rely on it. If that happens, XRP could climb to the $250–$500 range. And then there’s the global derivatives market, which is worth over $1 quadrillion. If even a tiny slice—just 0.1%—gets settled through XRP’s network, the price could go over $1,000. That’s no longer just a dream, but a possible future built on utility. So why isn’t XRP there yet? Legal challenges, regulation delays, and market uncertainty have held it back. But if these barriers clear, the change could happen fast. Bitcoin hit massive prices like $100, 000 based purely on belief.

A significant meeting is on the horizon that could signal shifts in the Global Economic System and potentially influence the future landscape for digital assets. Understanding the Importance of the US Treasury Secretary’s Visit On May 8, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is set to embark on a visit to Switzerland. This trip is far from a mere formality. According to official sources, Secretary Bessent will engage in crucial talks with Swiss President Karin Ketter-Sutter and a senior Chinese economic official. The stated objective? To discuss the complex process of rebalancing the global economic system, aligning it more closely with U.S. interests. Why is this meeting particularly noteworthy for those tracking the crypto space? Because the ‘global economic system’ increasingly intersects with digital finance. Discussions around international trade, capital flows, currency stability, and financial regulation at this level inevitably touch upon the role of cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). What Does ‘Rebalancing the Global Economic System’ Mean in This Context? The phrase ‘rebalancing the global economic system’ is broad, but it typically encompasses several key areas: Trade Imbalances: Addressing deficits and surpluses between major economies. Currency Valuations: Discussing exchange rates and potential currency manipulation concerns. Supply Chain Resilience: Rethinking global production and distribution networks. International Financial Architecture: Examining the roles of institutions like the IMF and World Bank, and the future of cross-border payments. Regulatory Harmonization (or lack thereof): How different countries approach financial oversight, which is highly relevant to Crypto Regulation . From the U.S. perspective, ‘in line with U.S. interests’ could mean advocating for fairer trade practices, ensuring financial stability that doesn’t undermine the dollar’s global standing, and promoting regulatory environments that align with American standards, including those being developed for digital assets. The Key Players: US, Switzerland, and China The choice of participants and location is strategic: The United States: As the world’s largest economy and home to significant financial innovation and markets (including a major crypto ecosystem), the U.S. plays a central role in shaping global economic norms and regulations. The US Treasury Secretary is a key figure in articulating and implementing U.S. financial policy abroad. Switzerland: A long-standing hub for international finance and diplomacy, Switzerland has also emerged as a relatively crypto-friendly jurisdiction, particularly for blockchain technology and specific types of digital assets. Its neutral stance and financial expertise make it an ideal meeting ground for sensitive international discussions. Switzerland Finance is deeply intertwined with global capital markets. China: A rapidly growing economic superpower with its own ambitions for the global financial system, including the development and potential internationalization of its digital yuan (e-CNY). US-China Economic Talks are critical for managing competition and finding areas of cooperation on issues ranging from trade to technology and finance. Bringing these three together in Switzerland underscores the complexity and interconnectedness of today’s global economic challenges. It’s a trilateral format that allows for both bilateral discussions (US-Swiss, US-China) and potentially broader conversations about shared concerns or differing approaches. How Could These Talks Impact Crypto Regulation and the Digital Asset Space? While the official agenda focuses on broader economic themes, the discussions could easily spill over into the realm of digital assets in several ways: Will Crypto Regulation Be on the Agenda? Given the increasing global focus on establishing clear rules for cryptocurrencies and related services, it’s highly probable that Crypto Regulation will be an implicit, if not explicit, topic. The U.S. is actively working on its own regulatory framework, while China has taken a different approach involving strict controls. Switzerland has carved out its own path. Harmonizing approaches or understanding differing regulatory philosophies is crucial for preventing regulatory arbitrage and ensuring financial stability across borders. Cross-Border Payments and CBDCs Rebalancing the global system involves improving cross-border transactions. This is an area where both private cryptocurrencies and state-backed CBDCs could play a role. Discussions might touch upon: The efficiency and cost of current international payment systems. The potential impact of CBDCs (like China’s e-CNY or potential future digital dollars/francs) on global currency dynamics. The use of digital assets for remittances and trade finance. The U.S. has expressed caution regarding a digital dollar but is actively researching the concept, while China is a frontrunner. Switzerland is also exploring digital forms of its currency. These talks could provide insights into how these major players view the future of digital money in international finance. Financial Stability and Risk Assessment Global economic stability is paramount. As the crypto market grows, its potential impact on traditional finance becomes a greater point of discussion among regulators and policymakers. The meeting could involve sharing perspectives on: Assessing risks posed by volatile crypto markets. Ensuring consumer and investor protection. Combating illicit finance using digital assets. These are concerns shared by the US Treasury Secretary and his counterparts globally. Potential Benefits and Challenges from These High-Level Discussions Such meetings offer potential benefits but also highlight significant challenges: Potential Benefits: Increased Clarity: Dialogue can lead to a better understanding of different countries’ stances on digital assets. Potential for Coordination: While full harmonization is unlikely, talks could identify areas for potential cooperation on standards or information sharing regarding Crypto Regulation . Risk Mitigation: Sharing assessments of risks related to digital assets could lead to more informed policy decisions globally. Improved Cross-Border Dialogue: Laying groundwork for more efficient and secure international financial interactions, potentially involving digital technologies. Challenges: Conflicting National Interests: The U.S., China, and Switzerland have different economic priorities and regulatory philosophies, particularly concerning capital controls and data privacy, which impact digital asset approaches. Pace of Innovation vs. Regulation: Technology moves faster than policy, making it difficult for regulators to keep up and coordinate effectively. Defining ‘Rebalancing’: Reaching a consensus on what a ‘balanced’ global economic system looks like, and whose interests should prevail, is inherently difficult. The Role of Non-State Actors: Discussions between governments don’t always fully capture the dynamics of decentralized technologies and private sector innovation in the crypto space. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community What should those in the crypto space take away from this upcoming meeting? While direct, immediate policy changes are unlikely to be announced from these high-level talks, they are indicative of the direction global economic policy is heading. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Official Statements: Keep an eye on any official readouts or press conferences following the meetings. Look for mentions of digital currencies, cross-border payments, or financial stability concerns that touch upon crypto. Understand Regulatory Trends: These discussions are part of a broader global trend towards increased Crypto Regulation . Stay informed about proposed rules in major jurisdictions like the U.S., EU, and potentially how countries like Switzerland and China are refining their approaches. Analyze Geopolitical Signals: The state of US-China Economic Talks significantly influences global markets, including crypto. Any signs of cooperation or tension could have market implications. Watch for CBDC Developments: Pay attention to how major economies discuss CBDCs internationally. Their design and interoperability (or lack thereof) will impact the future of international finance and the role of private digital currencies. Consider Switzerland’s Role: Switzerland Finance has a unique position. Observe how its regulatory stance evolves in light of international pressure and its own strategic goals in the digital asset space. These high-level meetings serve as a barometer for the evolving global financial landscape. They highlight that digital assets are no longer a fringe topic but are increasingly relevant in discussions about international finance, economic stability, and national interests. Conclusion: A Glimpse into the Future of Global Finance The upcoming visit by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to Switzerland for talks with Swiss and Chinese officials represents a crucial moment in ongoing efforts to navigate and potentially reshape the Global Economic System . While the primary focus is broad economic rebalancing, the interconnectedness of modern finance means that topics like Crypto Regulation , cross-border digital payments, and the future role of digital currencies are likely to be part of the conversation, either directly or indirectly. The outcomes of such discussions, even if not immediately public, will contribute to the complex web of international relations and regulatory approaches that ultimately shape the environment for digital assets worldwide. Staying informed about these high-level dialogues is essential for anyone seeking to understand the forces influencing the future of finance.

He believes that speculation season and sideways trading will end once the U.S. Treasury announces its use of XRP. He believes this development will bring the utility-driven bull run, and these remarks come amid new federal actions that could align with the broader use of digital assets, including XRP. When the U.S. Treasury announces they’re using $XRP Say goodbye to XRP speculation season. Say hello to XRP real utility bullrun. — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) May 5, 2025 Trump Administration’s Strategic Move Toward Digital Payments Shortly after inauguration, President Donald Trump shocked the market by announcing a strategic U.S. crypto reserve . Notably, the president named XRP in the official announcement on Truth Social, stirring excitement in the community. This move affirmed his commitment to the growth of the crypto industry, and he has followed it up with targeted executive orders to help the market grow. He recently signed an executive order to overhaul the U.S. Treasury’s payment systems . The directive seeks to replace inefficient, paper-based methods with secure digital transactions. The goal of the administration is to combat fraud, reduce waste, and streamline federal disbursements by integrating modern payment technologies. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The executive order shows a growing federal interest in incorporating digital solutions into the financial infrastructure. Enhancing transparency and improving security are central themes of the plan. As Farina implies, if XRP is selected for any portion of this modernization, speculation about its long-term viability may give way to confirmed institutional utility. Will the U.S. Treasury Adopt Cryptocurrencies? The appointment of Scott Bessent as Treasury Secretary adds further weight to this narrative. Bessent is known for his view that digital assets play a key role in U.S. financial competitiveness. His leadership is expected to drive policies integrating blockchain technology into national economic strategies. This shift in tone at the Treasury Department aligns with Farina’s comments, which frame XRP not as a speculative asset but a tool for national and institutional-level use. Utility May Define XRP’s Next Phase The convergence of governmental interest and potential institutional adoption marks a transition for XRP. Farina’s statement highlights this potential shift from market speculation, and many experts share this belief that utility will help XRP grow . While there has been no official confirmation of XRP’s inclusion in Treasury operations, ongoing signals suggest that such an outcome is no longer out of reach. If realized, it could position XRP at the center of a broader utility-driven bull market, validating Farina’s assertion and opening a new chapter in its role within U.S. financial systems.

Specifically, two prominent senators are pushing for new rules regarding digital asset ownership for federal officials, while also launching a pointed inquiry into a particular asset: the TRUMP meme coin. This move underscores growing concerns about conflicts of interest and transparency in the digital age, particularly as high-profile political figures become linked, directly or indirectly, to volatile digital assets. Why Are US Senators Targeting Crypto Holdings? Senators Chris Murphy (D-CT) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) have stepped forward with a significant legislative proposal. Their bill aims to prohibit federal officials from profiting from the trading or holding of digital assets. This isn’t the first time lawmakers have considered restrictions on financial holdings for public servants, but it marks a direct focus on the burgeoning world of cryptocurrencies. The rationale behind such a crypto regulation bill is rooted in the principle of public trust. Federal officials are privy to information and make decisions that can significantly impact various markets, including the rapidly evolving digital asset space. Owning or trading assets that could be affected by their actions or knowledge creates a potential for conflicts of interest crypto, where personal financial gain could improperly influence official duties. Think about it: If an official owns a substantial amount of a particular cryptocurrency, and they are involved in drafting legislation or regulations that could boost or tank its value, there’s an inherent conflict. This bill seeks to remove that temptation and ensure that officials are acting solely in the public interest, not their own portfolios. Key aspects of the proposed bill likely include: A clear definition of what constitutes a “digital asset” or “cryptocurrency.” Identifying which “federal officials” would be subject to the ban (this could range from high-level appointees to potentially a broader scope of employees). Specific prohibited activities, such as buying, selling, or holding certain types or values of digital assets. Mechanisms for enforcement and potential penalties for non-compliance. Possible carve-outs or exceptions (e.g., for diversified mutual funds that happen to hold some exposure, or for assets held prior to taking office, requiring divestment). This legislative push by the US Senators crypto community is watching closely is part of a broader trend of governments worldwide grappling with how to regulate digital assets and ensure ethical conduct among public servants in the face of new financial technologies. The TRUMP Meme Coin Under the Microscope Alongside their legislative efforts, Senators Murphy and Blumenthal have launched a specific inquiry into the Trump meme coin , also known by its ticker symbol TRUMP or MAGA. This investigation elevates concerns from the general concept of officials owning crypto to a specific instance involving a former President and potential future candidate. Meme coins are a unique, often highly volatile, class of cryptocurrencies typically based on internet memes, cultural trends, or, in this case, political figures. Their value is often driven more by speculation, community hype, and sentiment rather than underlying technology or utility. According to a report by Fox61, the senators’ concerns regarding the TRUMP meme coin are multi-faceted: Potential Conflicts of Interest: Given Donald Trump’s prominent political status and potential future political activities, any financial interest he holds in a coin bearing his name and associated with his political brand raises questions about whether his actions or statements could be influenced by his financial stake in the asset. Foreign Influence: The inquiry reportedly touches upon concerns about foreign actors potentially using such assets for influence or financial manipulation. The global nature of cryptocurrency markets means that holders and traders of assets like the TRUMP coin are located worldwide, making the source and intent of large holdings difficult to trace. Reported Earnings: A key driver of the investigation appears to be the significant reported earnings linked to the coin. Fox61 reported that concerns include Trump’s reported earnings exceeding $100 million from the coin’s trading fees. While the mechanics of such high earnings specifically from *trading fees* for an individual linked to a meme coin are complex and potentially involve other factors like appreciation of held tokens, the sheer magnitude of the reported figure has clearly caught the attention of lawmakers, highlighting the significant financial stakes involved. The senators are likely seeking information on who benefits from the coin, how it was distributed, its ties to political campaigns or entities, and the extent of any involvement or profit by individuals associated with federal office. Understanding Conflicts of Interest Crypto Poses for Officials The core issue highlighted by both the proposed bill and the TRUMP coin investigation is the unique challenge digital assets pose regarding conflicts of interest for federal officials crypto is becoming intertwined with. Unlike traditional assets like stocks in large, established companies where officials might recuse themselves from specific decisions directly impacting those companies, the crypto market presents new complexities: Market Volatility: Crypto markets are known for extreme volatility. Significant personal holdings mean an official’s net worth could swing wildly based on market movements, potentially creating pressure to act in ways that benefit their portfolio. Information Asymmetry: Officials might have access to non-public information about upcoming regulations, enforcement actions, or policy changes that could drastically affect crypto prices. Trading on such information would be a clear ethical violation and potentially illegal. Decentralization and Pseudonymity: While not entirely anonymous, the pseudonymous nature of many crypto transactions can make tracking ownership and identifying potential influences more difficult than with traditional financial assets. Novelty and Lack of Precedent: Existing ethics rules were primarily designed for traditional assets. Applying them effectively to the diverse and rapidly changing world of digital assets requires new interpretations or specific legislation. Politically Linked Assets: Assets like the Trump meme coin add another layer, directly tying financial value to political fortunes and figures, blurring the lines between personal finance, political activity, and public service. These factors make the case for clear rules regarding federal officials crypto holdings more urgent in the eyes of many lawmakers and ethics watchdogs. What Could This Mean for Crypto Regulation Bill Efforts? The actions by Senators Murphy and Blumenthal are not happening in a vacuum. They are part of a broader, ongoing debate in the United States about how to regulate the cryptocurrency industry. Numerous bills have been proposed in Congress, addressing everything from market structure and consumer protection to taxation and environmental impact. This specific focus on federal officials’ holdings and politically themed tokens could add momentum to the overall regulatory push. It frames the issue not just as a financial or technological one, but as an ethical and governance challenge directly impacting the integrity of public service. While a bill banning officials from profiting from digital assets might seem narrow, it sets a precedent and reflects a growing sentiment among lawmakers that the status quo regarding crypto and public office is insufficient. Success in passing this type of legislation could pave the way for further regulatory clarity or action in other areas of the crypto market. Conversely, the political nature of the TRUMP coin inquiry could also inject partisan dynamics into the regulatory debate, potentially complicating efforts to pass comprehensive crypto legislation that requires bipartisan support. Potential Challenges and Criticisms While the goals of transparency and preventing conflicts of interest are widely supported, any legislation banning federal officials from owning digital assets is likely to face scrutiny and potential challenges: Scope: Defining who is a “federal official” and what level of involvement or knowledge warrants a complete ban on digital asset ownership can be complex. Should it apply to every government employee, or only those in positions of power or with access to sensitive information? Enforcement: Tracking compliance in the decentralized crypto space can be difficult. How would such a ban be effectively monitored and enforced? Personal Liberty: Some might argue that a complete ban infringes on the personal financial freedom of public servants, potentially making it harder to attract talent to government roles. Defining “Profit”: The bill targets “profiting.” How is this defined in the context of volatile assets? Does it include unrealized gains? What about receiving assets (like airdrops) without directly purchasing them? Distinguishing Asset Types: Should the rules differentiate between highly speculative meme coins and more established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, or potentially stablecoins? These are questions that will need to be addressed as the bill potentially moves through the legislative process. Similarly, the TRUMP coin investigation will need to navigate complex issues of proving intent, tracing transactions, and determining the extent of any improper influence or activity. What Happens Next? The proposed bill will need to go through the standard legislative process, including committee review, potential amendments, and votes in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. Its passage is far from guaranteed and will depend on various factors, including political will, lobbying efforts, and public opinion. The investigation into the Trump meme coin is an inquiry, meaning the senators are gathering information. This could lead to various outcomes, such as a public report detailing their findings, recommendations for regulatory or legislative action, or potentially referrals to other oversight bodies if evidence of wrongdoing is found. For the broader crypto market and those interested in the intersection of digital assets and politics, these developments signal that lawmakers are increasingly paying attention. Politically themed tokens, in particular, are likely to remain under scrutiny. Conclusion: Navigating the Evolving Landscape The actions taken by Senators Murphy and Blumenthal represent a significant moment in the ongoing conversation about cryptocurrency and ethics in government. By proposing a bill to restrict federal officials’ digital asset holdings and launching an investigation into the TRUMP meme coin, they are directly confronting the potential for conflicts of interest crypto assets introduce into the political sphere. While the path forward for both the proposed legislation and the investigation remains uncertain, they highlight crucial questions about transparency, influence, and the need for clear rules in a rapidly changing financial and technological landscape. As the world of digital assets continues to evolve, so too will the challenges and the need for careful consideration of their impact on public service and democratic integrity. Staying informed about these developments is essential for anyone involved in or observing the cryptocurrency market, particularly as regulatory frameworks continue to take shape in the United States and globally.

Pseudonymous analyst Jack tells his 268,600 followers on X that he doesn’t expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates at Wednesday’s meeting, despite oil falling below $60 – a level he says reflects “bad financial conditions.” Oil is trading at $59.77 at time of writing, down over 22% from its 2025 opening price of $77.46. Crashing oil prices typically signal demand destruction and a weakening global economy. According to the analyst, the gloomy macroeconomic backdrop sets up the “perfect trade” for BTC. “How does Bitcoin perform here? Best guess is it follows equities but decouples and recovers quickly. Take gold as an example in March 2020: a short, shallow crash, and then the start of the steepest phase of its parabolic trend. It would be the perfect trade and could be the base for a mind-blowing rally.” In March 2020, gold lost nearly 15% of its value before igniting a 43% surge in just five months. Zooming in on Bitcoin, Jack says BTC needs to stay above $93,000 to avoid witnessing another corrective move. “Low time frame BTC bulls don’t want to see price at X again. Otherwise, I expect a flush.” Source: Jack/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $96,791, up over 2% in the past day.

Bhutan, a landlocked country in south-central Asia, is now accepting crypto payments through a new national-level tourism system powered by Binance Pay and DK Bank, which Binance calls the world’s first of its kind. The initiative allows travelers with Binance accounts to pay for nearly every part of their journey using crypto. This includes airline tickets, visa fees, hotel stays, monument entry, tour guides, and even “fresh fruit from roadside stalls,” according to a Wednesday announcement . Binance says more than 100 local merchants have already been onboarded, though it didn’t name specific businesses accepting crypto. According to the announcement, visitors can pay by scanning dynamic or static QR codes via the Binance app, with support for over 100 cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin ( BTC ) and USD Coin ( USDC ). While tourists pay in crypto, merchants still receive in local currency, as all transactions are settled through DK Bank, Bhutan’s digital bank licensed by the Royal Monetary Authority of Bhutan.

In 2022, more than 10% of the educated population emigrated. The exact size of Bhutan’s BTC holdings remains unclear, though data from different blockchain analytics firms implies that it could be worth more than $600 million, or about 30% of the country’s GDP.

A significant milestone has just been reached by ZKsync (ZK), a leading Ethereum layer-2 (L2) scaling solution. ZKsync announced on X (formerly Twitter) that it has successfully achieved full Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) equivalence. This is more than just a technical upgrade; it’s a breakthrough moment with profound implications for developers, users, and the entire Ethereum Layer 2 ecosystem. What Does ZKsync EVM Equivalence Really Mean? Before this announcement, layer-2 solutions often aimed for EVM compatibility, meaning they could run code written in languages like Solidity. However, achieving full EVM equivalence is a much higher standard. It means the L2 network behaves *exactly* like the Ethereum mainnet’s EVM at the bytecode level. Think of it this way: EVM Compatibility: Your car can run on a specific type of fuel (Solidity). EVM Equivalence: Your car is identical to another car down to every bolt and wire, so any mechanic can use their standard tools and parts on it without needing special training or equipment. For ZKsync, this level of equivalence is a game-changer. It allows developers to use existing Ethereum tools, clients, toolkits, and configuration files without needing to modify them or learn ZKsync-specific versions. Previously, developers might have needed specialized compilers like zkSolc or frameworks tailored for ZKsync, such as Foundry ZKsync, to deploy smart contracts. Now, they can take their compiled EVM bytecode – the low-level instructions that the EVM understands – and deploy it directly onto ZKsync. This removes a significant barrier to entry for developers looking to build or migrate decentralized applications (dApps) to ZKsync. Why is Full EVM Equivalence So Important for ZKsync Development? Achieving full ZKsync EVM equivalence offers a multitude of benefits, primarily centered around simplifying the development process and accelerating ecosystem growth. Here are some key advantages: Seamless Migration: Existing dApps on Ethereum mainnet or other EVM-compatible chains can be ported to ZKsync with minimal, if any, code changes. This drastically reduces the time and effort required for projects to leverage ZKsync’s scaling capabilities. Access to Standard Tools: Developers can continue using familiar and widely-adopted Ethereum development tools like Hardhat, Truffle, Remix, Metamask (for interaction), Ethers.js, and Web3.js. This eliminates the need to learn new toolchains, lowering the learning curve significantly. Broader Developer Pool: Any developer experienced with building on Ethereum is now effectively a ZKsync developer. This opens the door to a much larger talent pool, encouraging more innovation and development on the platform. Enhanced Security & Auditing: Since the code behaves identically to Ethereum, existing security practices, auditing tools, and formal verification methods designed for the EVM can be applied directly to ZKsync contracts, potentially improving the security posture of deployed applications. Faster Iteration: With reduced complexity in the development and deployment pipeline, teams can build, test, and deploy new features or dApps more quickly. This move positions ZKsync as a highly attractive destination for developers seeking scalability without sacrificing the familiarity and robustness of the Ethereum development environment. The Bigger Picture: EVM Equivalence and Blockchain Scaling The race for effective blockchain scaling is crucial for the widespread adoption of decentralized technologies. Ethereum, while pioneering, faces limitations in transaction throughput and cost on its mainnet, especially during periods of high demand. Layer-2 solutions like ZKsync are designed to alleviate this by processing transactions off-chain and then submitting a compressed summary or proof back to the Ethereum mainnet. Zero-Knowledge (ZK) rollups, the technology underpinning ZKsync, use cryptographic proofs to verify the correctness of off-chain computations. This approach offers strong security guarantees inherited from Ethereum. Achieving full EVM equivalence is a critical step in the evolution of ZK-rollups. Historically, one of the main challenges for ZK-rollups has been achieving true EVM compatibility, let alone equivalence, due to the complexity of proving arbitrary EVM computations within a ZK-proof system. ZKsync’s success here demonstrates significant progress in this area, making ZK-rollups more accessible and practical for the vast majority of Ethereum developers. This development not only benefits ZKsync but also pushes the entire field of Ethereum Layer 2 scaling forward, setting a high bar for other L2 solutions aiming for similar levels of developer experience and compatibility. What’s Next for ZKsync and its Ecosystem? With full ZKsync development now aligned with standard Ethereum practices, we can anticipate several positive outcomes: Increased dApp Deployment: Expect a surge in the number and variety of dApps deploying on ZKsync, as the technical hurdles have been significantly lowered. This could include established DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, gaming platforms, and more. Enhanced Liquidity and Activity: More dApps naturally lead to increased user activity, transaction volume, and potentially greater liquidity within the ZKsync ecosystem. Innovation: Developers freed from dealing with ZK-specific tooling can focus more energy on building innovative applications and features. Potential for User Growth: While EVM equivalence is primarily a developer benefit, a thriving ecosystem with more dApps and better performance ultimately benefits end-users through more options and potentially lower transaction costs. This achievement is a testament to the hard work of the ZKsync team and a positive signal for the future growth of their network and the broader Ethereum scaling landscape. In Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment ZKsync’s announcement of achieving full EVM equivalence marks a pivotal moment for the platform and the Ethereum ecosystem. By enabling developers to use standard Ethereum tools and deploy existing bytecode directly, ZKsync has removed a major barrier to entry, making L2 development significantly more accessible and efficient. This breakthrough is set to accelerate ZKsync development , attract more projects, and contribute meaningfully to the critical goal of blockchain scaling for Ethereum.

In its official X account, WLFI commented , “WLF fam — it’s time. A new Snapshot vote is live to airdrop USD1 to all eligible WLFI holders. Free USD1. The hottest stablecoin in crypto. Don’t miss your chance — vote now.” WLFI airdrop proposal is garnering overwhelming support With more than 99% of votes in favor, the airdrop will distribute a small amount of USD1 stablecoin to eligible WLFI token holders, as outlined in the May 6 proposal on the WLFI governance forum. The proposal states that testing the airdrop mechanism in a live setting is crucial to ensure smart contract functionality and readiness. This distribution also serves as a meaningful way to thank the earliest supporters and introduce them to USD1. The amount of USD1 is yet to be determined but will be based on the total eligible wallets and budget. The date for the airdrop is also pending, and WLFI says it reserves the “right to discontinue, suspend, modify or terminate the test airdrop” at any time. Voting is set to conclude on May 14. So far, support for the measure is overwhelming, with approximately 2.6 billion tokens, representing 99.97%, cast in favor, while just 901,000 tokens, or 0.03%, have been used to vote against it. WLFI also partnered with HTX Global and ListaDAO On May 5, WLFI reported that the USD1 sellable reportedly was launched officially on HTX Global. The company noted token trading would be made available on May 6, and the withdrawals would be permitted as of May 7. Besides working with HTX Global, WLFI also announced that it has teamed up with ListaDAO to merge USD1 into its system. ListaDAO even recently confirmed that the USD1 Vault is already live, and the USD1/lisUSD liquidity pool and USD1 as CDP collateral will launch soon. It even announced that it would have more integrations with WLFI in time. So far, all of WLFI’s collaborations around the USD1 token appear to align with its stated goals of ensuring compliance, promoting transparency, and increasing the token’s visibility. Eric Trump, the US president’s son, and WLFI co-founder Zach Witkoff have consistently emphasized that they aim for USD1 to be the most compliant, transparent, and trustworthy stablecoin. Eric even thinks facilitating the development of transparent stablecoins such as USD1 might be conducive to the internationalization of the US dollar. WLFI snapshot vote for its USD1 airdrop s hows an almost 100% approval rate and will end next week. Similarly, last month, WLFI declared that it would conduct an airdrop of its USD1 stablecoin to qualifying WLFI token holders. The company said the test would increase visibility into USD1 before launching it more widely . Moreover, they argued that testing the airdrop mechanism would ensure smart contract functionality and readiness . WLFI and President Trump are still under scrutiny over their projects WLFI launched USD1 in April after Congress started discussing the STABLE Act. Critics quickly pointed out that President Trump had conflicts of interest, given his ties to WLFI. To worsen the situation, about $390 million was reportedly allocated to DT Marks DEFI LLC, a Trump-affiliated entity, from the $550 million raised during WLFI token sales, arousing more questions. Not to mention, WLFI’s governance token is still non-transferable, raising more concerns over transparency and decentralization. Senator Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Maxine Waters have even asked the SEC to disclose internal documents on WLFI over regulatory favoritism concerns. Their request follows the commission’s move to pause enforcement actions on Justin Sun, a WLFI investor and founder of the Tron blockchain.

Solayer’s token has dropped by nearly 35% in the past 24 hours, trading at $1.75 as of press time. The token is now down 47.8% from its all-time high of $3.39 set on May 5. Market activity surged alongside the price drop, with over $1.26 billion in LAYER traded in the last 24 hours, a 179% increase, as per CoinGecko data . The sharp decline appears to be driven by investor fear over an upcoming May 11 token unlock.

Khi đồng tiền mã hóa hàng đầu thế giới ghi nhận mức tăng 14.08% , vượt xa kỳ vọng và thậm chí còn lật kèo sau cú sập đau đầu tháng. Đợt tăng giá này giúp Bitcoin tăng hơn 32% từ mức thấp nhất $74,501 trong tháng Tư leo lên gần $98,000 – một minh chứng rõ ràng cho sự bền bỉ đỉnh cao của tài sản này giữa bối cảnh kinh tế vĩ mô đầy biến động và tâm lý rủi ro thay đổi liên tục. Việc giành lại vùng giá $95,000 – ranh giới dưới của vùng giao dịch ba tháng trước đó – hiện là mốc kỹ thuật quan trọng nhất . Nếu Bitcoin giữ vững được vùng giá này, đặc biệt khi nó đang củng cố trên mức Chi Phí Cơ Sở của Nhà Đầu Tư Ngắn Hạn ở $93,340, thì rất có thể sẽ mở đường cho một cú bứt phá trở lại đỉnh cao mọi thời đại. Dữ liệu on-chain cũng đang ủng hộ kịch bản tích cực này: các thợ đào vẫn ôm chặt Bitcoin, và chỉ số Puell Multiple cho thấy họ không có ý định xả hàng ồ ạt. Điều này cho thấy niềm tin rằng đợt tăng giá chưa dừng lại ở đây. Dù diễn biến ngắn hạn phụ thuộc vào việc BTC có thể biến mức hỗ trợ này thành nền tảng bền vững hay không, nhưng các tín hiệu cấu trúc vẫn nghiêng về xu hướng tăng – đặt sân khấu cho một mùa hè bùng cháy nếu điều kiện vĩ mô ổn định. Dự Trữ Bitcoin của Thợ Đào (Nguồn: CryptoQuant) Nền kinh tế Mỹ thể hiện sự vẻ ngoài ăn chắc mặc bền trong tháng Tư, với 177,000 việc làm mới được tạo ra và tỷ lệ thất nghiệp ổn định ở mức 4.2% . Tỷ lệ tham gia lực lượng lao động tăng lên, và các ngành chủ chốt như giáo dục, y tế và dịch vụ khách sạn tiếp tục tuyển dụng. Tuy nhiên, tốc độ tăng lương đã chậm lại ở mức 0.2% hàng tháng và 3.8% hàng năm, số lượng việc làm mới giảm, và một số ngành như sản xuất và bán lẻ mất việc – những dấu hiệu cho thấy thị trường lao động đang hạ nhiệt. Những con số tích cực này che giấu những vấn đề cấu trúc sâu xa hơn, khi các công ty có thể đang “ ôm chặt nhân sự ” sau những khó khăn trong tuyển dụng trước đây, và báo cáo việc làm ngày càng được coi là một chỉ báo trễ. Trong khi đó, chi tiêu tiêu dùng dường như ổn định trên bề mặt nhưng lộ ra nhiều vết nứt bên dưới – doanh số mua hàng hóa lâu bền giảm mạnh , trong khi hàng hóa tiêu dùng nhanh và dịch vụ tăng nhẹ . Một đợt tăng tạm thời trong đầu tư thiết bị đã kéo số liệu đầu tư tư nhân lên, nhưng sức mạnh kinh tế tổng thể vẫn yếu. Nhập khẩu tăng vọt hơn 40%, làm thâm hụt thương mại mở rộng và kéo GDP quý I giảm 0.3%, chủ yếu do các doanh nghiệp đẩy mạnh nhập hàng trước khi thuế quan tăng. Tổng Sản Phẩm Quốc Nội (GDP) (Nguồn: Cục Phân Tích Kinh Tế) Niềm tin người tiêu dùng đã lao dốc xuống mức thấp nhất kể từ năm 2020 , với Chỉ Số Kỳ Vọng giảm xuống mức thường gắn liền với suy thoái. Những lo ngại về thu nhập, an ninh việc làm và lạm phát – được thúc đẩy bởi căng thẳng thương mại kéo dài – đang đè nặng lên tâm lý. Khi áp lực lạm phát từ thuế quan gia tăng và tốc độ tăng trưởng thu nhập hộ gia đình đình trệ, nước Mỹ đang đối mặt với một giai đoạn hạ cánh mềm đầy bất ổn của nền kinh tế. Trong thế giới crypto, Nexo đã chính thức tái xuất thị trường Mỹ sau hai năm ẩn mình, viện dẫn môi trường pháp lý thuận lợi hơn và sự ủng hộ chính trị, đặc biệt dưới thời chiến dịch thân crypto của Trump. Công ty này hiện đặt mục tiêu cung cấp một bộ sản phẩm tài chính dựa trên crypto hoàn toàn tuân thủ, phản ánh sự chuyển dịch của ngành hướng tới hợp tác với cơ quan quản lý. Trong khi đó, Hạ Viện Arizona đã thông qua hai dự luật cho phép tiểu bang đầu tư tối đa 10% quỹ của mình vào Bitcoin và các loại tiền mã hóa khác, có thể biến Arizona thành tiểu bang đầu tiên ở Mỹ nắm giữ crypto trong hệ thống quỹ dự trữ và hưu trí – mặc dù kết quả vẫn chưa chắc chắn do Thống đốc Hobbs cảnh báo phủ quyết vì những lo ngại về ngân sách. Bên kia Đại Tây Dương, chính phủ Anh đã đưa ra dự thảo luật quản lý các nền tảng crypto, nhấn mạnh bảo vệ người tiêu dùng và minh bạch, đồng thời tăng cường hợp tác với Mỹ để xây dựng khung pháp lý xuyên Đại Tây Dương. Cuối cùng, SEC đã kết thúc cuộc điều tra về stablecoin PYUSD của PayPal mà không có hành động thực thi nào, báo hiệu sự rõ ràng tiềm năng trong quy định về stablecoin và củng cố vị thế của PayPal trong hệ sinh thái tài sản số đang phát triển.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/trader-says-xrp-will-repeat-this-major-rally-soon-heres-why/,"XRP community member and social media user “Lord XRP” posted a statement on X claiming, “#XRP WILL REPEAT IT SOON,” accompanied by a historical screenshot from CoinMarketCap showing XRP trading at $3.11 with a market capitalization exceeding $120 billion. The image reflects when XRP ranked second in global cryptocurrency market capitalization, just behind Bitcoin and ahead of Ethereum, a position it no longer holds today. The attached image, likely from early January 2018, captures XRP at its all-time high of $3.11 with a 24-hour trading volume of over $5.6 billion and a circulating supply of 38.7 billion XRP. At that point, the token had posted a 24-hour gain of 29.70%, highlighting a surge in investor interest during the peak of the previous major crypto bull run. According to Lord XRP’s post, the current market context suggests a similar price level could soon be revisited. #XRP WILL REPEAT IT SOON pic.twitter.com/3wEPQ67L56 — Lord XRP (@Bitforcoinz) May 4, 2025 Community Member Remains Hopeful While Lord XRP’s post centers on historical data, additional comments from other X users contribute to the sentiment within the XRP community . A user named Sophia replied to the post, stating , “I hope that as you said, XRP will shine in the near future!” Her comment reflects optimism among long-time XRP holders , many of whom have been anticipating a return to previous highs following regulatory clarity and broader market recovery. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Investor Sentiment and Historical Comparisons The use of the CoinMarketCap image is central to Lord XRP’s message. The post is not merely a nostalgic look at the 2017–2018 bull market but a declaration that such valuations are achievable once again. The XRP community continues to monitor signs of institutional adoption, regulatory progress, and Ripple’s ongoing developments, such as its acquisition of Hidden Road , viewing them as key catalysts that could drive XRP to revisit the $3.11 level. Lord XRP’s post does not provide a timeframe or specific catalysts for the price prediction. Instead, the tweet serves as a reminder of XRP’s achievements and a call for confidence in its future. For many in the community, such historical context strengthens their belief that XRP is undervalued relative to its past and potential.

With Ethereum’s upcoming hard fork, Binance has announced it will both delist underperforming trading pairs and temporarily suspend withdrawals and deposits on several networks. Delisting of Spot Trading Pairs on May 9 Binance will delist three spot trading pairs —ANIME/BNB, STRK/BTC, and THE/BTC—on May 9, 2025, at 03:00 UTC. The exchange stated that the decision was made due to low trading volumes and poor liquidity, which can negatively affect the user experience and overall market quality. Users who hold positions in these pairs are advised to close or adjust them before the delisting takes effect. Temporary Suspension of Deposits and Withdrawals on May 7 In addition to the delisting, Binance will suspend deposits and withdrawals across multiple blockchain networks on May 7, 2025 , to support the upcoming Ethereum network upgrade and hard fork. The suspension will begin at 09:45 UTC, approximately 20 minutes before the scheduled upgrade at 10:05 UTC. The networks affected include Ethereum (ETH), Arbitrum (ARB), Optimism (OP), zkSync Era (ZKSYNC), Base (BASE), Manta Network (MANTA), Starknet (STRK), Polygon (POL), Metis (METIS), Scroll (SCR), Cyber (CYBER), Metal DAO (MTL), Celo (CELO), and Worldcoin (WLD). Binance has confirmed that deposits and withdrawals on these networks will resume once the upgraded network is stable and secure. Binance noted that these measures are part of its broader effort to ensure platform reliability, asset security, and smooth operations during critical blockchain events like the Ethereum upgrade. This Ethereum hard fork is expected to introduce several core improvements to the network, and Binance’s proactive steps are designed to minimize risk and enhance user safety throughout the process.",News|Exchange News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ETH|EXCHANGE|BNB|FORKS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-07 07:26:35

World Liberty Financial (WLFI) has initiated a governance vote to determine whether a small amount of its newly launched stablecoin, USD1, should be airdropped to early WLFI token holders. The proposed airdrop is being positioned as a test of the technical functionality of the airdrop mechanism. The vote is set to conclude on May 14 and has already seen overwhelming support from the community. According to data from the WLFI governance forum , over 2.6 billion tokens—representing approximately 99.97% of votes cast—are in favor of the proposal. A small minority, totaling about 940K tokens, have voted against it. While the airdrop itself has not yet been scheduled, WLFI has made it clear that the test could be modified or canceled at any time at its discretion.

The coin is fully backed by reserves consisting of short-term U.S. Treasuries, cash, and equivalent high-quality assets. Digital asset custodian BitGo will oversee the reserves backing USD1. “USD1 provides what algorithmic and anonymous crypto projects cannot—access to the power of DeFi underpinned by the credibility and safeguards of the most respected names in traditional finance,” said WLFI co-founder Zach Witkoff. The stablecoin was quietly deployed on the BNB Chain in early March. Its presence was first detected by blockchain analytics firm LookOnChain, which traced the contract to a wallet associated with crypto market maker Wintermute, indicating preliminary test transactions. On March 24, CZ noted that the stablecoin’s smart contract had been deployed 20 days ago, confirming an early March launch. On March 25, WLFI formally announced the launch of USD1, stating that the stablecoin would first become available on Ethereum ( ETH ) and Binance Smart Chain ( BNB ), with plans to expand to other blockchain networks.

Kaito ( KAITO ) rallied to hit an intraday high of $1.17 on May 7 before cooling down a bit to around $1.13 by press time. That’s nearly a 70% gain from last month’s low. Its market cap has also exploded, sitting at over $273 million. As of May 7, morning Asian time, its daily trading volume was 340% higher than the previous day at over $317 million, indicating a major rise in trading activity. The surge followed a sharp increase in futures open interest in recent days, which hit a 2-month high of $103 million, way up from about $37.7 million just a month ago, per data from CoinGlass. The simultaneous rise in price and open interest typically signals strengthening bullish sentiment. KAITO crypto’s recent price surge appears to be the renewed attention it’s getting after Kaito integrated Huma Finance’s Yapper leaderboard ahead of its TGE. Yappers are users who actively post and engage with crypto-related content on X, and they earn rewards through Kaito’s platform .

According to the announcement , eligible yappers will get special rewards, likely in tokens like KAITO or even Huma’s upcoming token or ecosystem perks, for boosting awareness of Huma Finance. Momentum was already high after Kaito founder Yu Hu, in a May 5 X post, announced they’re kicking off the ‘Earn and Drop’ season with the first collaboration being with PayFi Network BOOP . we kicked off social airdrop season in Jan with bera, story, kaito and many others we kicked off our strategic KAITO accumulation in Mar and accumulated ~3M KAITO in we are kicking off our earn and drop season in May with BOOP and so many other opportunities to come… — Yu Hu 🌊 (@Punk9277) May 5, 2025 On top of that, the project recently added Total Value Distributed data to its Dune Analytics dashboard, giving more transparency into how rewards are flowing across the ecosystem. Dune data shows that over $71 million in rewards have already been distributed to yappers, stakers, and hodlers across the ecosystem, excluding the KAITO airdrop. The project also now boasts over 200,000 monthly active yappers, showing strong community growth. Meanwhile, a look at CoinGlass reveals that investors have withdrawn more than 2 million KAITO tokens from exchanges in the past 30 days. This withdrawal trend hints at accumulation by holders, which adds to the positive sentiment. Kaito price analysis On the 4-hour USDT chart, KAITO broke out above a descending parallel channel yesterday, a move that suggests the downtrend might be over and bulls are taking charge. KAITO price, CMF and Aroon chart — May 7 | Source: crypto.news Before this, KAITO had already broken out of a multi-week descending trendline, adding to the bullish momentum. The buying pressure is also showing up in the indicators: the Chaikin Money Flow has climbed to 0.21, signaling stronger demand, while the Aroon Up is at a high 97.86% and the Aroon Down is all the way at 0%, showing buyers are clearly dominating. With this setup, KAITO might be on track to retest the $1.50 psychological resistance it hit back in March, that’s roughly 32% higher than where it’s trading right now. However, market commentators remain optimistic that the rally could extend even further, potentially reaching $1.75, thanks to a rounded bottom pattern showing up on the 1-day chart, a major bullish reversal sign in technical analysis.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands at phase 4 of its token sales with $0.025 per token and has sold more than 443 million tokens where 57% of this specific phase has been acquired. Dogecoin maintains a current price at $0.18 but investors believe it might reach $1 while Solana stands at $151 but anticipates reaching $200 because of ongoing ETF approval discussions. Dogecoin’s Meme-Driven Push Market analysts detect that Dogecoin shows signs of an impending breakout according to its weekly chart data. A Gaussian Channel analyzes that Dogecoin will probably reach $1 with a 450% increase from its current market value of $0.18. Social media hype and whale activity create risks for the platform due to its dependence on these factors. Network transaction data indicates that retail participant interest in the market seems to be waning as records demonstrate a 94% decline. The current absence of fresh utility systems makes a 70x gain (approximately $12.60) for Dogecoin appear unlikely to materialize. Market participants continue to discuss Dogecoin actively due to its volatile price behavior although volatility creates significant challenges. Solana’s Scalable Ambition The cryptocurrency market keeps Solana at $150 and above while the price has climbed 20% across the past month. Experts predict Solana will reach $280 since the predicted approval probability of ETFs stands at 80% during 2025. Market participants have been active based on its $3.39 billion trading volume yet the $160 resistance point might create barriers to additional growth. The projection of a 70x price increase up to $10,570 appears unlikely because its current market capitalization and congestion issues already exist. Solana wins developers through its scalable properties although its expansion pace seems lower than what some projects achieve. Mutuum Finance’s DeFi Surge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently building its position as an important part of decentralized lending solutions. Current Mutuum Finance investors stand to gain huge returns through phase 4 of its 11-stage presale which is 57% filled at $0.025. Investors can expect a 140% value growth when Mutuum Finance tokens enter the market at $0.06. The target price projection for MUTM after its launch settlement stands at $2.50 which represents a staggering 9,900 percent increase from its current value. The team is finishing a Certik audit of its smart contracts while preparing to reveal the results through social media channels to increase confidence. The recently introduced dashboard system offers bonus tokens to the top 50 holders who keep their positions. Mutuum’s Lending Edge The peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer dual-lending system operates as the main reason why users are drawn to the platform. The liquidity pools formed by lenders generate interest for them while borrowers obtain funds through loans requiring elevated collateral amounts. Holding MUTM tokens steady through platform fees enables token purchases that distribute funds to staker participants and maintains a stable market demand. The latest phase exceeds its fundraising goal by $7.6 million which will lead the project to its end while intensifying the critical nature of its last stretch. Early investors must rush to benefit from the decreasing opportunity to purchase MUTM at $0.025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) establishes itself through organized progress which positions the project for considerable market expansion opportunities. Mutuum’s Path to 70x The calculated DeFi approach adopted by Mutuum Finance positions it as one of the leading services in its sector. Mutuum will deliver a 140% listing success while forecasting $2.50 as its goal which demonstrates a 70x increase potential to $1.75 value by 2026 thus surpassing both Dogecoin’s speculative price swings and Solana’s gradual growth path. The continuing audit process joins with leaderboard rewards to enhance investor confidence. Mutuum Finance emerges as the preferred project because it presents both fundamental capabilities and a strong launch presale performance. Potential investors pursuing high investment returns need to research Mutuum Finance (MUTM) prior to phase 5 launch.

44268929,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157979,1746603020,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent: Binance Suspend Deposits on Multiple Networks for Ethereum Upgrade May 7,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/binance-suspend-deposits-ethereum/,"Attention crypto users! Stay informed about crucial updates from one of the world’s leading crypto exchanges. In recent crypto exchange news , Binance has announced a significant upcoming event that will temporarily impact users dealing with certain tokens. Why is Binance Suspend Deposits on Multiple Networks? Binance recently communicated through its official channels that it will implement a temporary halt on deposit and withdrawal services for tokens operating on a variety of networks. This isn’t a cause for alarm, but rather a necessary step taken in anticipation of a scheduled Ethereum network upgrade and associated network hard fork . Network upgrades and hard forks are critical events in the life cycle of a blockchain. They involve significant changes to the protocol, often introducing new features, improving efficiency, or enhancing security. For a large platform like Binance, preparing for such an event requires careful coordination to ensure the safety and integrity of user funds and transactions during the transition period. By temporarily pausing deposits and withdrawals, Binance can manage the transition smoothly, preventing potential issues that could arise from transactions initiated during the upgrade process. This proactive measure is standard practice across major exchanges during significant blockchain updates. Understanding the Binance Transaction Suspension The announced Binance transaction suspension is set to begin around 09:45 UTC on May 7. It’s important to note that this suspension is temporary. Binance has stated they will reopen deposits and withdrawals once they deem the upgraded network stable and operational, and they have completed their internal checks. Users should be aware that trading of the affected tokens will generally remain unaffected during this period. The suspension specifically targets the movement of tokens onto or off the exchange via the listed networks. Internal transfers or trading pairs on Binance should continue as normal, subject to overall market conditions. While the exact duration of the suspension is not typically fixed in advance – as it depends on the successful completion and stability of the network upgrade – users are advised to monitor official Binance announcements for updates on when services will resume. Which Networks Are Affected by the Suspension? The upcoming suspension is quite broad, covering tokens on several popular networks that interact with the Ethereum ecosystem or are related layer-2 solutions. The networks impacted by the decision to Binance suspend deposits and withdrawals include: Ethereum (ETH) Arbitrum (ARB) Optimism (OP) zkSync Era (ZKSYNC) Base (BASE) Manta Network (MANTA) Starknet (STRK) Polygon (POL) Metis (METIS) Scroll (SCR) Cyber (CYBER) Metal DAO (MTL) Celo (CELO) Worldcoin (WLD) This extensive list highlights the interconnectedness of these networks with the core Ethereum infrastructure and the potential impact of the Ethereum network upgrade across the broader ecosystem. Actionable Insights for Users For users who frequently deposit or withdraw tokens on these networks via Binance, here are some key takeaways: Plan Ahead: If you need to deposit or withdraw tokens on any of the listed networks, ensure you complete these transactions well before the scheduled start time of the suspension (09:45 UTC on May 7). Monitor Announcements: Keep a close watch on Binance’s official announcement channels (website, app notifications) for real-time updates regarding the suspension start, progress of the network hard fork , and the eventual resumption of services. Understand the Scope: Remember that this primarily affects deposits and withdrawals on the specific listed networks. Trading within Binance should not be impacted. Be Patient: Network upgrades can sometimes have unforeseen delays. Patience is key while the upgrade is completed and verified. This proactive communication from Binance is part of responsible exchange management, aiming to protect user assets and ensure a smooth transition during significant blockchain protocol changes. While a temporary inconvenience for those needing to move funds, it’s a necessary step for the long-term health and functionality of the affected networks and the broader crypto ecosystem. Conclusion: Navigating the Ethereum Network Upgrade The upcoming Binance transaction suspension is a direct consequence of the planned Ethereum network upgrade and subsequent network hard fork . By temporarily halting deposits and withdrawals for tokens on Ethereum and several related networks starting May 7, Binance is taking necessary precautions to ensure a seamless transition for its users and maintain the security of funds. This event underscores the dynamic nature of blockchain technology and the importance of staying informed about crypto exchange news and network developments. Users are encouraged to complete any necessary transactions before the deadline and monitor official communications for updates on the resumption of services.

Since mid-April, billions of dollars have been flowing into Bitcoin ETFs — but that’s not all. Bitcoin whales have also been buying huge amounts of BTC, even though the market hasn’t made a big move just yet. Could this be a setup for the next big rally? Let’s break it down. Billion-Dollar Bitcoin ETF Inflows Ahead of FOMC Meet Starting April 16, Bitcoin ETFs have attracted over $5.13 billion in total inflows. One of the main drivers of this is BlackRock, whose iShares Bitcoin Trust alone pulled in $4.7 billion since early April. As traders brace for the upcoming FOMC decision, a major positive that crypto won't see a serious drop is the fact that Bitcoin ETF inflow money has been sky-high since mid-April. Since April 16th, there has been $5.13B moved into collective BTC ETF's, pumping markets. pic.twitter.com/tbDFcBexGQ — Santiment (@santimentfeed) May 7, 2025 However, despite the strong inflows in recent weeks, Bitcoin ETFs saw an outflow of $85.7 million on May 6. This ongoing accumulation comes just ahead of the FOMC’s rate decision, where there’s a 98% chance , according to Polymarket, that the Fed will keep interest rates unchanged at 4.50%. If that happens, it would mark the third straight meeting without a hike, possibly giving Bitcoin more room to breathe. Big BTC Whale Buying Huge, Retail Sells At the same time, on-chain data tells an interesting story. Big Bitcoin whales with a wallet of 10 to 10,000 BTC have quietly added more than 81,000 BTC in the last six weeks. On the other hand, smaller wallets (holding less than 0.1 BTC) have sold around 290 BTC in the same period. This shows that while retail investors are unsure or losing patience, large holders are quietly building positions. Bitcoin Price Outlook Looking at the price momentum, Bitcoin price has briefly hit $97,500 before pulling back to $96,694, gaining about 2.35%. Meanwhile, prominent crypto analyst Crypto Rover recently shared some important price points for Bitcoin. He says that if Bitcoin starts to go up again, it will need to break these levels: $98,000: Bitcoin is close to this price but hasn’t gone past it yet. $102,000: This is an important level many traders are watching. $106,000: This could be the last hurdle before Bitcoin reaches a new high. Rover’s chart also shows that Bitcoin might drop to around $92,000 before it starts rising again, possibly reaching $106,000.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-07 07:32:08

The protocol will be led by Torab Torabi as the new CEO. On May 7, the network announced that it has terminated co-founder Rushi Manche and will proceed under a new leadership structure. “Details on leadership changes and a revamped governance structure will be coming soon,” said the protocol in an official post . Not long after, a new account emerged called The Movement ( MOVE ). It informed traders that the protocol has relaunched itself as Move Industries, a self-dubbed “new company” under a new leadership structure. Additionally, co-founder Cooper Scanlon has voluntarily stepped down as CEO. Therefore, Move Industries will be helmed by Torab Torabi as its CEO and ecosystem architect alongside Will Gaines, who will serve as President and Chief Marketing Officer. “This next chapter will ensure we continue building world-class infrastructure, world-class businesses and a world-class movement,” said Gaines in an official press release. Torabi views Move Industries as “the beginning of an exciting new chapter for the Movement” and vows to fully commit to improve the ecosystem, strengthening the community and supporting projects built on the network.

However, it appears the network’s recent restructuring has done little to save its native token, MOVE, from the inevitable tumble it has taken since market making allegations erupted. At press time, MOVE has gone down nearly 10% in the past 24 hours. It is currently trading hands at $0.16. In the past week, the token has plummeted more than 34%. In contrast, its daily trading volume has seen an exponential rise, having gone up by 141.4% compared to the previous trading day, indicating more market activity amidst the restructuring notice. What happened to Movement Labs’ Rushi Manche? Earlier this month, the protocol declared that it would be suspending co-founder Rushi Manche in light of a recent scandal involving one of its market makers, Rentech. This led to to the token being delisted from Coinbase , effectively suspending all related trading pairs. At the time, the protocol was still undergoing investigations from third-party reviewer Groom Lake “regarding organizational governance and recent incidents involving a market maker.” The token dump occurred December last year, when Rentech allegedly sold 66 million MOVE for an estimated profit of 38 million USDT ( USDT ). Binance reported the issue in March, freezing the money and notifying the Movement Foundation and Movement Labs. Since then, the protocol has cut off all ties with the market maker and pledged a $38 million USDT buyback through a new reserve fund.

The governor revealed that the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) will release about 1 trillion yuan ($178.2 billion) in liquidity. PBOC’s governor said the move would raise liquidity and stimulate China’s economic growth after an ongoing trade war with the U.S. He also said the government would increase the amount of money available for factory upgrades and other innovations, elder care, and other service businesses.

PBOC noted it will be the first reduction in 2025, with policymakers seeking to boost liquidity and prop up economic growth amid a heightened trade war with the U.S. Gongsheng told reporters on Wednesday that the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) will generate roughly 1 trillion yuan in liquidity, approximately $178.2 billion. He did not say when the cut will kick in, but the reduction follows two 50 basis point cuts for all banks that took effect in February and September last year. Gongsheng acknowledged that Beijing’s reverse repo rate on commercial banks’ deposits with PBOC was also reduced to 1.4% from 1.5%. The People’s Bank of China’s lending rate to commercial banks was also cut by 0.25 percentage points to 1.5%. The financial institution also reduced interest rates on five-year housing loans. As China battled a trade war with the U.S. after President Trump imposed triple-digit tariffs on Chinese goods, the country pledged at a key meeting in late April to cut banks’ reserve requirement ratio “in a timely manner.” Xing Zhaopeng, Senior China Strategist at ANZ, argued that the country’s domestic economy must be strong enough before Beijing starts any protracted trade negotiations.

Trump’s tariffs have begun to take a toll on China’s export-dependent economy, which has also faced pressure from a prolonged downturn in the property sector. The world’s two largest economies remained entangled in a standoff over Trump’s tariffs of as high as 145% on imports of most Chinese products. Beijing also retaliated with up to 125% tariffs on U.S. goods and ceased buying most American farm products. “We do not expect the reaction to be euphoric. Point being, any trade resolution would likely take a long time, and in the near term, there may be some piecemeal exemptions or tariff reductions on certain goods.” -Tan Jing Yi, Market Economist at Mizuho Bank. The trade talks have come at a time when both parties have remained adamant, at least in public, about not compromising on the tariffs. In a report, Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said that the talks could be the pivot point that either locks in fragile confidence or re-ignites the trade war. Both economies have shown signs of strain in recent weeks, after companies and consumers rushed to beat tariff increases. The U.S. economy plummeted by 0.3% in January-March. China’s economy grew at a 5.4% annual pace in the first quarter of the year after factories elevated production to fill a surge in orders. News of plans to boost the Chinese economy and for China-U.S. trade talks have pushed share prices up more than 2% in Hong Kong and 0.5% in Shanghai early Wednesday, with U.S. futures also advancing.

If so, there’s a crucial update you need to be aware of. Bithumb, one of South Korea’s major Crypto Exchange platforms, has officially announced a temporary halt on specific services related to the Gravity (G) token. This move is directly tied to an upcoming significant event for the project: its Mainnet Transition . What’s Happening at Bithumb ? According to an announcement posted on their official website, Bithumb will be temporarily suspending both deposit and withdrawal services for the Gravity (G) token. This isn’t a random event or a sign of trouble; rather, it’s a standard procedure performed by exchanges to support major network upgrades like a mainnet transition. Service Affected: Gravity (G) Deposits and Withdrawals Start Date & Time: May 7th, 2024, at 05:00 UTC Reason: To support the Gravity Mainnet Transition Duration: The suspension is temporary; services will resume after the transition is successfully completed and the network is deemed stable by Bithumb. Users should take note of the exact time provided. Any attempts to deposit or withdraw Gravity G tokens after this deadline on May 7th may result in loss of funds or significant delays once services resume. It’s always best practice to complete any necessary transactions well before the announced suspension time. Understanding Gravity G and Its Mainnet To fully grasp the significance of this announcement, it helps to understand what a mainnet is. In simple terms, a mainnet is a blockchain network that is fully developed and operational – it’s where actual transactions occur and the protocol lives. Before launching a mainnet, projects often operate on testnets (for testing) or on other blockchain networks as tokens (like ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum). A Mainnet Transition involves moving from a test environment or another chain onto the project’s own native, live blockchain. This is a complex technical process that requires careful coordination. While the specifics of the Gravity (G) project and its use case weren’t detailed in the Bithumb announcement, the fact that it’s undergoing a mainnet transition suggests the project is maturing and deploying its core technology. This transition is often aimed at: Improving scalability and transaction speed. Enhancing security features. Introducing new functionalities or features unique to the project’s protocol. Establishing full control over the network’s governance and development. Why a Deposit Withdrawal Suspension is Necessary You might wonder why a Deposit Withdrawal Suspension is required for a mainnet upgrade. It’s primarily for the safety and security of user funds and to ensure a smooth transition of assets to the new network. Here’s why exchanges like Bithumb implement these suspensions: Preventing Asset Loss: During the transition, the underlying network for Gravity (G) is changing. Deposits sent to the old network or addresses might not be recognized on the new mainnet, leading to lost funds. Similarly, withdrawals processed during the transition could face complications. Ensuring Accurate Balances: Exchanges need to accurately account for all user holdings on the old chain before the snapshot or migration to the new mainnet occurs. Suspending services ensures no new transactions complicate this process. Technical Integration: Bithumb’s systems need time to integrate with the new Gravity mainnet. This involves updating wallet infrastructure, testing connectivity, and ensuring compatibility with the new blockchain’s protocols. Minimizing Risk: Halting deposits and withdrawals is a precautionary measure to minimize potential risks associated with the complex technical procedures of a mainnet swap. Navigating the Mainnet Transition : What Users Need to Know For users holding Gravity G on Bithumb , the primary action is inaction during the suspension period. However, here are some actionable insights: Plan Ahead: If you need to deposit or withdraw G, do so well before the May 7th, 05:00 UTC deadline. Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on Bithumb’s official announcements regarding the exact duration of the suspension and when services will resume. Be Patient: Mainnet transitions can sometimes take longer than initially anticipated. Understand that the exchange is working to ensure the safety of your assets. Your Holdings Are Safe: Your G tokens held on Bithumb are generally safe during this process. The exchange manages the technical aspects of migrating your balance to the new mainnet. Challenges users might face include missing the deadline for transactions or uncertainty about the exact time services will be restored. Relying on official communication channels is key to overcoming this uncertainty. The Role of a Crypto Exchange During Upgrades This event highlights the crucial role that a Crypto Exchange like Bithumb plays in supporting the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. When projects undergo significant upgrades like a Mainnet Transition , exchanges act as intermediaries, handling the complex technical migration process on behalf of their users. This saves individual users the trouble of managing private keys or navigating complex migration tools themselves. Supporting mainnet swaps requires significant technical effort from the exchange’s side, involving developers and security teams working to ensure a seamless and secure transition for all user assets held on the platform. Conclusion The temporary Deposit Withdrawal Suspension for Gravity G on Bithumb , effective May 7th at 05:00 UTC, is a standard and necessary step to facilitate the project’s Mainnet Transition . While it means a brief interruption in service for G holders on the platform, it signals a significant step forward for the Gravity project itself. Users should ensure they complete any necessary transactions before the deadline and monitor Bithumb’s official channels for updates on service resumption. This process underscores the critical function of a reliable Crypto Exchange in managing complex network upgrades for its user base, ensuring the safety and integrity of digital assets during periods of significant technical change.

A planned meeting to discuss U.S. and China tariffs sent risk assets higher in the hours since the U.S. stock market closed on Wednesday, as reported , but those gains reversed as news of India’s “Operation Sindoor” emerged in the early hours. Traders expect to see more volatility in the days ahead as the regional tussles further damage risk-taking sentiment among traders, though eventually leading to a move higher as bitcoin is perceived as a hedge. “Volatility in the markets is soaring as bitcoin surges to $97K from the intensifying conflict between India and Pakistan,” Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “This is in addition to plans by the US and China to discuss a trade deal this week. This upward movement came as a surprise, as investors were de-risking positions ahead of a decision by the Fed about changing interest rates. Geopolitical uncertainty and macroeconomic volatility may send Bitcoin to new highs as a hedge against greater market risks,” Ruck added. Cardano’s ADA led gains among majors with a 3% bump in the past 24 hours, adding to gains from Tuesday. Dogecoin (DOGE), XRP, BNB Chain’s BNB and ether (ETH) added less than 2%, while legacy tokens Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Litecoin (LTC) surged as much as 10%. The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a liquid index tracking the largest tokens by market cap, added nearly 2%. Meanwhile, some traders said bitcoin’s surge in the past weeks was coupled with a spike in active addresses — a metric of wallet activity that some consider a sign of oncoming volatility. “Bitcoin’s recent rally to the $87,500–a spike in active addresses backs $97,500 range (now at a 6-month high) pointing to rising demand and renewed network activity,” Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “This surge supports a bullish case for a potential breakout toward $100K, though confirmation depends on multiple indicators aligning,” Lee said, mirroring separate analyst commentary from the past week. “Traders should also monitor macro conditions, Bitcoin dominance, currently nearing the 55% mark, and rising hash rates.

Lee, who is the Democratic Party’s presidential candidate, has rolled out a set of crypto-friendly promises as part of a larger pitch to win over younger voters, according to a Korea Economic Daily report. With the June 3 election approaching, Lee made it clear that digital assets would play a key role in his plans. In a social media post on May 6, Lee said he wants to help young people “[build] assets and plan for the future” by making crypto investment safer and more accessible. He pledged to push for the legalization of spot crypto ETFs, along with the creation of a unified oversight system to strengthen protections for investors and bring more transparency to the market. Among other reforms, Lee said he would work to reduce trading fees and overhaul current regulations, signaling a broader effort to make crypto a more stable and mainstream investment option for everyday users. Lee’s message seems aimed squarely at younger South Koreans who’ve been priced out of traditional assets like real estate and stocks and are turning to crypto in search of better returns.

With around 16 million crypto users, roughly 36% of the electorate , digital asset investors have become a major voting bloc. Politicians from both major parties are actively courting them . The Democratic Party has reportedly brought in a token securities expert, Professor Kim Yong-jin, to help shape policy, and one of its lawmakers recently introduced a draft bill dubbed the Digital Asset Promotion Basic Act. Meanwhile, the ruling People Power Party has laid out its own ambitious plan to support the crypto sector. Back in April, the party unveiled a seven-part strategy , including a commitment to approve spot Bitcoin ETFs this year. Further, it wants to scrap South Korea’s one-exchange-one-bank rule, allow institutions to trade crypto, and roll out a stablecoin regulatory framework in line with global standards. As previously reported by crypto.news, Representative Park Soo-min of the People Power Party said South Korea has “no time to delay” on ETFs, especially with jurisdictions like Hong Kong and the U.S. already moving ahead. The party is also pushing to set up a special crypto committee directly under their presidential candidate, Kim Moon-soo, who has spoken out about the lack of protection for the millions of Koreans now invested in digital assets.

44269642,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=394904,1746604475,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/44269642.jpeg,Inside 1inch with Aleksandra Fetisova: From Institutions and Memes to the Future of DeFi,https://cryptopotato.com/inside-1inch-with-aleksandra-fetisova-from-institutions-and-memes-to-the-future-of-defi/,"At the heart of DeFi innovation, 1inch has built one of the most popular decentralized exchange aggregators in the space. At Paris Blockchain Week 2025, we sat down with Aleksandra “Sasha” Fetisova, Head of Business Development at 1inch, to understand what’s next: for 1inch, DeFi, and the industry, in general. Sasha revealed the latest upgrades, challenges in the ecosystem, and the trends she believes will reshape DeFi over the next few years. Reinventing the Swap Experience For those unfamiliar, 1inch doesn’t operate like a traditional DEX — it’s a DEX aggregator. Instead of providing a standalone marketplace, it scans hundreds of decentralized exchanges to deliver the best possible rates to its users. Recent updates, Sasha explained, have pushed this even further. “We improved our swap experience with an intent-based, cross-chain gasless solution called Fusion,” she said. “It’s interoperable across EVM chains, doesn’t rely on third-party bridges, and is protected against MEV [maximum extractable value] attacks. It’s all about making swaps faster, cheaper, and safer.” For regular users, this means lower friction and lower cost, particularly when moving assets across chains — a pain point that’s long plagued decentralized finance. Fees are a sensitive topic in crypto, where gas costs and platform cuts can quietly drain portfolios. “Our users can be sure they’re doing direct swaps without any added fees,” Sasha emphasized. “We’re a community-driven project, and we don’t charge users on our DApp or mobile wallet.” Behind the scenes, she credits the project’s developers for optimizing routing and smart contracts to keep swaps efficient and cheap. But that’s not the only factor: “We aggregate liquidity from over 500 DEXs across 10 to 13 chains,” she said. “Plus, in Fusion mode, we work with professional market makers — resolvers — who pull liquidity not just from decentralized sources but also from centralized exchanges.” Security Through Minimalism One feature of 1inch’s approach is its laser focus on security. “We’ve never been hacked,” Sasha stated firmly. “That’s because we do at least five to ten audits every time we update or launch something new.” But it’s not just audits. She pointed to co-founder and CTO Anton Bukov’s philosophy of writing minimal, highly efficient smart contracts. “Instead of creating bloated, complex code, Anton spends hours thinking and then writes a small, functional piece of code — something that can be audited quickly and runs efficiently,” she explained. “It’s a very intentional design.” Going Global: From Decentralized Team to Dubai Hub Although 1inch was born during the remote-work explosion of COVID, the team recently opened its first physical office in Dubai. “We see the IMEA region as very fruitful, especially under current market conditions,” Sasha shared. “If our community is traveling to Dubai, we’re happy to show them around!” She hinted that Dubai’s choice aligns with favorable conditions for crypto innovation. Looking beyond 1inch’s immediate roadmap, Sasha reflected on the broader trends shaping DeFi. “In the next cycle, we’ll see more institutions entering DeFi,” she predicted. “We’re already seeing centralized exchanges like Binance and OKX launching Web3 wallets, and even banks — like Societe Generale with its FORGE platform — exploring DeFi integrations.” On the more chaotic side of the market, she acknowledged the rise of meme coins. “When Trump launched his meme coin, it brought in a lot of new users, but many of them got wrecked,” she said. “I’d love to see some kind of education or maybe even system notifications warning people that meme coins are meme coins — they’re not guaranteed wealth machines.” Real-World Assets and AI: The Next Frontiers Sasha is particularly excited about the tokenization of real-world assets. “I met someone who tokenized mangoes for an African central bank — can you imagine?” she said, laughing. “We’re going to see more real estate tokenization, hedge fund tokenization… These are the trends that could bring the first billion users into crypto.” And what about onboarding those billions? “We need AI agents,” Sasha asserted. “Imagine an AI assistant in the 1inch wallet that guides new users, answers their questions, and helps them navigate features. I can only help maybe 100 people a day; an AI agent can help thousands, 24/7.” Towards the end of April, 1inch had a major announcement: its expansion to Solana. “We’re not just EVM-compatible anymore; we’re expanding to Layer 1s, and we invite users to guess which chains are coming next.” The post Inside 1inch with Aleksandra Fetisova: From Institutions and Memes to the Future of DeFi appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto News|Interviews|DeFi,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|BNB,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-05-07 07:54:35

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Dogecoin may dominate the memes and ride bullish waves, but Remittix is quietly building real-world momentum that could reshape the payments game for good. Table of Contents Remittix takes on $250t payments market Dogecoin bounce signals a meme-fueled rally again PEPE’s push is real but can it outpace DOGE and RTX? Conclusion Once a joke, now a juggernaut, Dogecoin has defied the odds time and again. Backed by memes, Elon Musk and a cult-like community, DOGE has carved out a permanent seat at crypto’s top table. With recent price action hinting at a breakout, many traders are betting that Dogecoin will leave relatively new tokens like PEPE in the dust. But there’s a twist in this tale. Remittix (RTX), a rising PayFi protocol priced under 10 cents, isn’t here to play meme games. While DOGE rides waves of sentiment, Remittix is locking in real-world use, enabling crypto-to-fiat transfers straight to bank accounts, instantly. Backed by a booming $14.7m presale and Ethereum’s credibility, it’s attracting serious investor attention. DOGE may have the brand and the buzz to beat PEPE, but read on to find out why Remittix could outpace them both. Remittix takes on $250t payments market For all its memes and momentum, Dogecoin still isn’t solving one of the world’s biggest financial headaches: cross-border payments. The $183 trillion banking sector, despite its size, still leans on outdated rails, with delays, hidden fees and intermediaries that make international transfers a logistical nightmare. Remittix bridges traditional finance and blockchain, enabling users to send crypto that lands directly into local bank accounts as fiat, without the need for correspondent banks or middlemen. This is in stark contrast to platforms like Stripe and Wise, which stop at fiat rails. It’s faster, cheaper and smarter. Transactions clear in seconds and fees are transparent and minimal, unlike the unpredictable costs of banks and legacy services. While DOGE is fun and speculative, Remittix delivers on functionality, unlocking global payments for the next generation of crypto users. That’s not just innovation. It’s a disruption. You might also like: Cardano, Dogecoin, and Remittix feature as analysts pick most undervalued cryptos Dogecoin bounce signals a meme-fueled rally again Dogecoin ( DOGE ) price action is flashing bullish signals, according to a growing number of crypto analysts. Trader Tardigrade, a respected chart watcher on Crypto X, recently noted that Dogecoin has “consistently found support at previous swing highs.” Most recently, it rebounded from a level that aligns with Q4 2023’s highs, just like before a massive run last year. This technical pattern suggests Dogecoin may have completed its pullback and could enter its next major wave. If history repeats, DOGE could skyrocket as high as $0.80 before August, with some ultra-bulls even eyeing $1.10. Source: X, formerly Twitter Despite lagging behind Bitcoin over the past year, Dogecoin has a habit of surprising the market with rapid rallies, especially when memecoin hype returns. Analysts like Bitcoinsensus and Muro Crypto believe the next DOGE pump could spark the broader altseason. PEPE’s push is real but can it outpace DOGE and RTX? While Dogecoin may be the market’s meme king, Pepe Coin ( PEPE ) is quietly building a case for the crown. According to UniChartz, PEPE respects a rising trendline with textbook precision, a signal of strong, sustained bullish control. Technicals are heating up, too. UniChartz notes that the MACD has flipped positive, suggesting bullish momentum is gaining strength. If PEPE breaks cleanly above its 100 EMA, currently acting as a ceiling, it could unlock a sharp rally toward the $0.00001152 mark, with $0.00001313 and even $0.00001731 in sight. Source: X.com Despite these promising signs, DOGE maintains a stronger position in the meme coin market. DOGE’s established presence and recent technical patterns suggest it may continue to outperform newer entrants like PEPE in the near term. Conclusion Dogecoin’s staying power and bullish chart setup give it a clear edge over Pepe Coin, which still battles key resistance zones. However, DOGE may face stiff competition from RTX, a rising star already selling out fast, with 66.56% of its token allocation gone and nearly 531 million RTX sold. Even as Dogecoin holds strong among memecoin fanatics, with this level of demand and hype, RTX could be the real disruptor this year. To learn more about Remittix, visit the website and socials.

By 2028, AAVE could reach a maximum price of $829.30. In 2031, AAVE will range between $2,006 to $2,476. Aave is a leading decentralized finance ( DeFi ) protocol on the Ethereum blockchain .

Participants in the Aave ecosystem can deposit their digital crypto assets back into liquidity pools to earn their interest payments or obtain loans by borrowing funds without providing collateral. Aave’s governance and fee distribution are significantly driven by its native token, AAVE, enhancing its utility and value within the platform. Having touched its ATH at $666.86 in May 2021, how much will AAVE be worth in 2025? Is AAVE worth holding? Let’s get into the Aave technical analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Aave Ticker AAVE Current price $174.03 Market cap $2.78B Trading volume (24-h) $262.09M Circulating supply 15,106,580.63 AAVE All-time high $666.86 on May 19, 2021 All-time low $26.02 on Nov 5, 2020 24-hour low $163.77 24-hour high $179.66 Aave price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 10.89% 50-day SMA $164.09 14-Day RSI 60.72 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 67 (Greed) Green days 16/30 (53%) 200-Day SMA $217.64 Aave 1-day price analysis: AAVE faces resistance at $189 Key takeaways AAVE loses momentum, down 2.13%. Key support lies at $164.30. MACD shows that bullish momentum is still intact despite reduced upside. Aave 1-day price chart: AAVE’s rally is pausing, bulls look cautious Per the price analysis on May 7, AAVE is facing mild selling pressure, down 2.13% to $174, after failing to break above the upper Bollinger Band ($189). The RSI at 59.2 hints at fading bullish strength — still neutral but cooling off from overbought levels. AAVE ’s rally is pausing, bulls look cautious MACD remains positive, showing the uptrend isn’t broken yet, but the histogram bars are shrinking, signaling momentum is slowing. Support lies around the mid-Bollinger band at $164; a dip below could invite more sellers. AAVE’s rally is pausing, bulls look cautious, and unless $180+ is reclaimed soon, the price may drift lower toward support. Aave 4-hour price chart: The coin is stuck near $174 On the 4-hour chart, AAVE is showing clear hesitation. The price is stuck near $174, hovering around the Alligator’s lines, which are tight and flat — meaning no clear trend. AAVE is stuck near $174 The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) at -0.05 hints at slight capital outflows, while the Balance of Power at -0.31 confirms that bears are subtly in control. No big breakdown yet, but the bulls are definitely on the back foot. A push above $176 might revive momentum, while a drop below $172 will confirm sellers stepping in. Aave technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $163.97 BUY SMA 5 $174.50 SELL SMA 10 $173.74 BUY SMA 21 $162.65 BUY SMA 50 $164.09 BUY SMA 100 $200.31 SELL SMA 200 $217.64 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $156.99 BUY EMA 5 $152.15 BUY EMA 10 $152.15 BUY EMA 21 $160.51 BUY EMA 50 $185.43 SELL EMA 100 $209.68 SELL EMA 200 $208.17 SELL AAVE price analysis conclusion AAVE is currently stuck in a consolidation phase, with momentum fading. Indicators show weakening buying pressure and indecision, hinting at a potential pullback if bulls don’t step up soon. A break below $173 could trigger further downside while reclaiming $180 is key for a bullish push. Is AAVE a good investment? Aave provides the essential infrastructure for lending and borrowing within DeFi, expanding beyond traditional applications into gaming, NFTs, and dApps. Its AAVE token plays a vital role in powering the platform, making it a strong choice for investors due to its proven market success and continuous development. Where to buy AAVE? AAVE tokens can be traded on centralized crypto exchanges. The most popular exchange to buy and trade Aave is Binance , one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, offering a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Coinbase, ByBit, OKX, Kraken and KuCoin also support AAVE. Why is AAVE down? The AAVE price candles show a price decline after facing rejection at the $179.65 resistance level. AAVE is now pushing to hold the $172.01 support level. AAVE price history | Coinmarketcap Will Aave reach $500? Aave (AAVE) can potentially reach $500 if it breaks through the current resistance levels and gains momentum from positive market sentiment and trends. AAVE had previously reached an ATH of $666.86; attaining $500 should be an achievable feat in the near term if market conditions align. Does Aave have a good long-term future? Aave shows potential for a good long-term future, given its ability to stabilize and recover after significant declines. The consistent support of around $116 indicates resilience and potential for future growth.

In a recent post on the social media platform X, Vet highlighted the poor state of user experience in XRPL applications and criticized the excessive technical barriers users must overcome to engage with decentralized platforms. XRP Ledger App complexity is not getting better. Unfortunately an issue in whole crypto. Handicapped by all the different layer 1, bad UI UX experiences and difficult interoperability. You want to use an XRPL App? Here's a 20h developer tutorial, download this GitHub… — Vet (@Vet_X0) May 5, 2025 According to Vet, the app ecosystem remains difficult to use despite the XRPL’s reputation for speed and efficiency . He noted that the process of engaging with even a single application on the ledger typically requires users to undergo extensive developer onboarding. Vet described a scenario in which users must dedicate significant time, such as 20 hours of developer tutorials, to understand how to interact with an application. He also pointed out the necessity of downloading code repositories from GitHub and grasping advanced XRPL concepts such as trustlines, which serve as a fundamental component for enabling token interactions on the network. Interface Design and Warnings Create Friction VET’s commentary also criticized the application interfaces, noting the prevalence of confusing layouts. He emphasized that excessive pop-ups and warnings may discourage non-technical users. He characterized these issues as part of a wider trend in the blockchain space, where projects are hindered by fragmented infrastructure, poor interoperability between protocols, and a lack of user-centered design. The user experience is further compromised by inconsistent design choices and unclear instructions, often overwhelming even those with some technical background. For everyday users unfamiliar with the XRPL’s design principles, these factors form a substantial barrier to entry. VET emphasized that such problems are not exclusive to XRPL but are common across the decentralized ecosystem. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A Decade of Minimal Progress in UX In response to a comment from another X user, Krippenreiter, who observed that the poor UX of XRPL apps has remained largely unchanged for over a decade, Vet acknowledged that the issue is not exclusive to the XRP Ledger. He emphasized that the technological landscape became more complex as the blockchain industry evolved beyond Bitcoin. This has contributed to the stagnation of meaningful improvements in usability. While some progress has been made, VET stated that many projects in the space fail to prioritize user experience. The discussion reflects a broader frustration among long-term observers of the industry who believe that blockchain applications are not progressing at a pace that aligns with increasing adoption goals. Although XRPL is known for features such as fast settlement and low transaction fees, these technical advantages are undermined by inadequate accessibility and interface design. Vet’s remarks exposed a critical gap between protocol-level efficiency and user-level engagement. Industry-Wide Complexity Stalls Adoption Efforts The lack of streamlined interfaces, consistent standards, and educational resources prevents widespread adoption of decentralized applications, not just on XRPL but across all major Layer 1 platforms. According to Vet, the complexity stems not just from poor design choices but also from the nature of the industry, grown to include a wide range of protocols, smart contract systems, and governance models, each adding layers of difficulty for developers and users alike. As calls grow louder for improved interoperability, clearer standards, and more intuitive design in crypto, the criticism from a known XRPL validator underscores the urgency of addressing these persistent shortcomings. Without substantive improvements to usability, XRPL and other blockchain platforms may struggle to attract and retain mainstream users, regardless of their technical capabilities.

Binance’s questionnaire covered a wide variety of security topics — while the results of the survey point to both increased awareness of security issues in the Asian markets as well as a high degree of trust in existing security measures. Some 40.7% of survey participants reported having experienced some form of exposure to crypto-related scams . In terms of the channels used to propagate these malicious ploys, X, Telegram, and Facebook seem to be the most commonly used — with 57%, 51.2%, and 46.5% users identifying these platforms as being leveraged to spread scam information in their regions. Social media platforms most commonly used to disseminate scams. Source: Binance Binance survey reveals users want real-time monitoring, public databases to strengthen crypto security Over half of the traders who answered the survey — 53.4%, to be exact — stated that they would immediately contact the exchange in the event of a scam. Moreover, some 84% said that they trust protections such as Binance’s emergency fund, SAFU. At present, 80.5% of queried users have the exchange’s 2-factor authentication (2FA) feature enabled — while 34.9% maintain a separate trading password. In contrast, only 10.9% of users forgo any additional security features. Data regarding enabled security measures. Source: Binance When it comes to future improvements, active, real-time monitoring on the part of exchanges, as well as access to public databases, seem to be priorities for cryptocurrency investors in Asia. Some 62.5% of respondents highlighted real-time interception of high-risk transactions as a security feature they would like to see exchanges strengthen, while 49.4% called for the establishment of public databases that would contain suspicious addresses Data regarding security measures users would like to see improved. Source: Binance In addition, the survey highlights a disparity between experienced crypto users and novices — with a full third of users still storing their private keys on internet-connected devices, a figure that climbs to 42% in Southeast Asia. Education remains a critical pillar of security, but there is evidently a need for improvement — as 55.8% of users find existing materials “too technical and hard to understand”, while 39.7% have stated a preference for localized, real-life case studies.

A new blockchain from ex- Monero developers is betting that privacy, playful crypto mining, and a dose of nostalgia can win over the next wave of crypto users, launching as a standalone proof-of-work network where anyone with a Mac or PC can mine its native Tari crypto under the XTM ticker, shield their balances from public view, and join a growing community of over 700,000 airdrop participants. Tari’s flagship app, Tari Universe, transforms mining into a visual experience — complete with real-time feedback, power usage sliders, and one-click controls that let users pause or throttle how much of their CPU is used. Mining is split between SHA3x and RandomX algorithms, with block rewards distributed 50/50 between standalone and merge miners. “Tari Universe turns your computer into a money machine. It works by harnessing your computers computational power to solve blocks on the Tari network. In doing so, you’re helping to secure the Tari network while earning Tari token (XTM) rewards.” Tari Tari’s emission model begins with a 21 billion XTM supply, of which 30% is pre-mined, per data from the official website. The rest — 14.7 billion tokens — is reserved for public mining, with rewards decreasing gradually on a per-block basis. A 1% tail emission ensures ongoing miner incentives after the first 12 years.

Tari’s tokenomics | Source: Tari The pre-mined portion is allocated to infrastructure (9%), community programs (5%), contributors (4%), and early participants (12%), with long vesting periods starting six to twelve months post-mainnet. The network uses a two-token system: XTM powers the base layer (called Minotari), while XTR operates on the second layer (dubbed Ootle). Users can burn XTM 1:1 to mint XTR via a dynamic “Throttle” mechanism, which adjusts minting costs based on demand, while fees burned during activity help manage supply. The balance between XTM and XTR is designed to tighten over time, though actual usage patterns remain to be seen.

But seasoned investors know that real gains aren’t always made at the top—they’re made by spotting hidden gems before the crowd catches on. Right now, with Bitcoin drawing attention, lesser-known altcoins like Dawgz AI are quietly gaining momentum. This moment offers a valuable window to load up on high-potential tokens still flying under the radar. In this post, we’ll highlight the best crypto to buy now that could deliver outsized returns as the market turns bullish again, plus smart strategies to get ahead of the next rally. Why This Dip Matters The crypto market never rises in a straight line. Even as Bitcoin charts its way to $100K, dips occur—but they present key opportunities for informed investors. What makes “buying the dip” effective? Cost-efficient entries: Purchasing tokens during dips ensures lower entry prices. Timing market shifts: By identifying solid projects now, you position yourself to benefit during the next wave of capital inflows. Momentum builds with Bitcoin: When Bitcoin gains momentum, quality altcoins often follow suit, enabling exponential growth in smaller-cap projects. Now is the time to spot undervalued cryptos that have tangible use cases, strong communities, and active development. Below, we’ll focus on three high-potential projects you shouldn’t overlook. What to Look for When Buying Crypto in a Dip Not every crypto is a good dip-buy candidate. To avoid losses, it’s essential to assess the following factors before making any investment decision. 1. Utility and Use Case Is this token solving a real-world problem? Cryptos with practical applications will typically fare better over long-term cycles. 2. Active Development Projects with consistent updates and innovation signal dedication and long-term focus from their team. 3. Community Backing A strong, loyal community keeps a project alive even during market lulls. Platforms like Discord, Telegram, and X (formerly Twitter) are great indicators of activity. 4. Sound Tokenomics A balanced supply and distribution model ensures price stability and incentivizes growth. Look for projects with transparent token releases and no excessive dilution. 5. Scalable Market Cap Projects with low market caps but strong fundamentals often deliver significant upside. Early-stage investment opportunities can bring the highest returns. Keeping these factors in mind, here are the best cryptos to buy now during the dip.

How to Position Yourself Before Bitcoin Hits $100K This dip won’t last forever. Bitcoin’s rally to $100K could trigger surging altcoin markets, driving prices sky-high. Here’s how you can prepare smartly for the next bull market. 1. Diversify Your Holdings Don’t put all your money into one token. Instead, balance your portfolio across different categories like AI-powered projects, privacy-focused tools, and infrastructure-based tokens. 2. Start Staking Take advantage of staking opportunities now. Early staking options, especially from Dawgz AI, offer additional income streams even before the market picks up momentum again. 3. Monitor Volume and Sentiment Use tools like CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap to study token trends, including price movement and volume surges. Early signs of investor confidence often signal when to increase your allocation. 4. Avoid Panic Buys It can be tempting to chase rising coins, but dips like these are where most gains are made. Stick to buying undervalued projects early. Act Before the Next Bull Run Market pullbacks are rare opportunities to build wealth by accumulating tokens with serious long-term potential. Dawgz AI in particular offers the perfect combination of innovation, community focus, and price entry levels under $0.01. Don’t wait for prices to skyrocket. Make your move today by visiting Dawgz AI. FAQ Section Which crypto can give 1000x in 2025?

No rate change might keep Bitcoin stuck in current range. Rate hike could push Bitcoin down toward key support zones. On May 7, 2025, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will wrap up its two-day meeting, making a key decision that could have an impact on both the stock and cryptocurrency markets. The focus will be on whether Jerome Powell and the FOMC choose to adjust interest rates. With President Trump vocal about his stance, there’s a 97% chance, according to the CME FedWatch Tool, that the FOMC will keep rates unchanged at 4.50%.

Despite rising interest in digital assets, current Basel Committee rules are pushing banks to the sidelines of a market they say they are eager to enter, according to a report by The Banker . Arnab Sen, CEO of GFO-X, a UK-based digital asset derivatives exchange, warned that regulatory constraints are preventing traditional financial institutions from participating in crypto markets. Speaking at the Financial Times’ Digital Assets Summit in London, Sen said, “The market is crying out for banks to intermediate Bitcoin trading and collateral services, but the existing rules make it almost impossible.” Basel Rules Treat Bitcoin as High-Risk Asset At the heart of the issue is the Basel framework, which assigns a 1,250% risk weight to unhedged crypto holdings such as Bitcoin—essentially treating the asset as highly speculative. This classification significantly increases the amount of capital banks must hold to support such exposures, rendering the business case unattractive. “These rules are freezing banks out of the space,” Sen said in an interview with The Banker . “There’s strong demand from institutional clients, but it’s just not viable for banks under current regulations.” This regulatory bottleneck is driving trading activity toward unregulated platforms or non-bank intermediaries, raising concerns about market oversight and systemic risk. $1.6 TRILLION BANK OF AMERICA’S CEO SAYS US BANKING INDUSTRY WILL SOON EMBRACE CRYPTO FOR PAYMENTS IT’S HAPPENING pic.twitter.com/PrNDFI6k9x — Vivek (@Vivek4real_) January 26, 2025 Sen noted that conversations are already underway among global regulators to revisit the treatment of Bitcoin under Basel rules. He expressed optimism that changes could be on the horizon. “I believe the Basel approach will be reviewed this year,” he said during a panel discussion on institutional crypto adoption. “There’s lobbying underway because institutional demand is growing rapidly.” Marcus Robinson, head of CDSClear and DigitalAssetClear at the London Stock Exchange Group, echoed these sentiments, saying institutions are showing “increasing interest and comfort” with crypto. Institutions Eyeing Crypto-Backed Lending Roger Bayston, head of digital assets at Franklin Templeton, added that firms are especially exploring ways to lend against crypto assets. Sen pointed to the recent repeal of SAB 121 in the U.S.—which had imposed accounting burdens on crypto custodians—as a key turning point that could open doors for banks to provide custody services. He described the repeal as “the first step” toward broader institutional participation. “The next intellectual step,” Sen said, “is to rethink how Bitcoin is treated on bank balance sheets.” According to a recent survey by Coinbase and EY-Parthenon , 86% of institutional investors surveyed said they had exposure to digital assets or planned to make allocations to cryptocurrencies in 2025. Besides, thanks to the evolving regulatory landscape worldwide, institutions are increasingly viewing cryptocurrencies as a legitimate component of a balanced investment strategy. Gadi Chait, Investment Manager at Xapo Bank, said in a recent interview that historically, institutional investors have been deterred by several factors, particularly crypto volatility concerns. However, he added that with more awareness and research, investors are understanding the varying degrees of risk and utility.

The meme coin sector momentarily slowed down, hinting at a potential rally if the broader market stabilizes after its recent downturn. Specifically, PEPE coin prices display a bullish pattern, presenting an opportunity for a breakout based on the daily chart analysis. Moreover, the volatility of meme coins is exacerbated by the prevailing market uncertainty. This causes fluctuations in PEPE prices as they oscillate in search of a solid support level to initiate a recovery. Considering investing in Pepe crypto?

The hourly price chart confirms that Pepe attempts to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a further recovery rally in the coming hours. If Pepe’s price holds momentum above $0.00000846, it will fuel a bullish rally to $0.00000982. PEPE/USD chart If bulls fail to initiate a surge, Pepe’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.00000753, beginning a bearish trend to $0.00000587. Is PEPE A Good Investment? Reviewing the Pepe project’s roadmap, it appears there are no detailed plans other than anticipation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate. Given this lack of clear direction and with an already sizable community of over 500,000 Twitter followers, the project’s price growth potential may be capped. However, meme coins have a reputation for offering significant returns, as their values can surge dramatically when supported by strong community movements. This was evident when Pepe’s value skyrocketed by over 222% to reach a new all-time high (ATH) following its listing on the Binance exchange. A similar significant announcement in 2025 could propel Pepe to surpass its previous ATH. Why is Pepe down today? Pepe’s price failed to gain buying demand above $0.000008. As a result, sellers gained control and plunged the price below the immediate Fib levels to strengthen their domination. Will Pepe Recover? If buyers push above the $0.00001 level strongly, we might see a recovery rally in the Pepe price chart. What is Pepe price prediction for 2025? The Pepe price prediction for 2025 expects the meme coin to record a maximum level of $0.000035. Will Pepe price reach $0.01? Pepe’s price might touch the $0.01 mark by the end of 2029. However, this price milestone entirely depends on the utility of Pepe coin and future buying demand. Will Pepe price reach $1? Pepe has a great community, and the hype is high for the meme coin. If everything remains good, we might see Pepe’s price touch $1 soon or by 2040.

Month Potential low ($) Potential average ($) Potential high ($) May 2025 0.0000059 0.0000072 0.0000098 Pepe price prediction 2025 The Pepe roadmap is somewhat vague, with few definitive plans beyond the expectation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate the market. Despite its robust community, this lack of clear direction might cap the project’s price potential. Meme coins have a reputation for offering significant financial returns, as their values can surge rapidly when supported by their communities. The impact of major announcements was evident when Pepe’s value soared by more than 222% following its listing on the Binance exchange, reaching an all-time high. A similar event in 2025 could potentially send Pepe to new peaks. In 2025, Pepe’s minimum expected price is projected to be $0.000005.

According to price data from crypto.news, Maple Finance’s ( SYRUP ) token hit an intraday high of $0.29 yesterday, May 6, putting it up more than 240% from last month’s low. At press time, its price had pulled back some of its gains and settled at $0.23, with its market cap around $253 million. SYRUP’s latest bounce occurred in a high-volume environment, with 24-hour trading volume up 2,400% to nearly $177 million. The hype extended beyond spot markets, with open interest in SYRUP futures soaring 2,400% in a single day to a record $6.72 million. A major catalyst for the rally was SYRUP’s listing on Binance and Bitget on May 6. While deposits opened immediately, withdrawals from both platforms are scheduled to begin today at 15:00 UTC. Listings on major exchanges such as Binance and Bitget tend to act as price catalysts by significantly enhancing token accessibility, market depth, and investor participation.

According to DeFiLlama data , Maple’s total value locked hit a new all-time high of $1.26 billion on May 7, up over 180% since the start of 2025, signalling growing trust and adoption in the platform’s ecosystem.

The 20-day EMA (blue) has crossed above the 50-day EMA (green), forming what traders call a “golden cross,” a signal that momentum is shifting in favor of the bulls. SYRUP price, 20-day and 50-day EMA chart — May 7 | Source: crypto.news At the same time, the Bull Bear Power indicator showed seven straight green candles, suggesting buyers have been dominating recently. On top of that, the Supertrend indicator has flipped green, reinforcing the bullish setup. SYRUP Supertrend and Bull Bear Power chart — May 7 | Source: crypto.news With this setup, SYRUP could be on track to retest the $0.30 psychological resistance, which it fell just short of in yesterday’s rally. A successful break above that could see it surpass its all-time high of $0.33, potentially opening the door for a move toward the $0.40 level if momentum stays strong. However, traders should watch out for a potential short-term pullback. The Relative Strength Index is currently at overbought levels, meaning SYRUP could see a cooldown or some profit-taking before trying for its next leg up.

However, in the most recent cycle, Bitcoin has shown a stronger correlation with risk assets rather than acting as a hedge. Under Trump’s administration, the push to legalize crypto positioned it as a “satellite asset” for excess USD liquidity. Furthermore, market participation has also shifted from retail investors to institutions. Bitcoin is currently experiencing lower volatility as the world sees mainstream adoption of crypto. Consequently, crypto’s independent cycles have weakened, increasingly syncing with global macro trends and resembling tech stocks with longer, smoother cycles driven by innovation. Influenced by his real estate background and his philosophy of “Leverage: don’t make deals without it”, Trump appears to be using layoffs and reduced government contracts (e.g., the DOGE initiative) to artificially create signs of recession in the data, thereby potentially pulling stocks into retracement. This strategy could pressure the Federal Reserve to cut rates. In this article, we review current U.S. dollar liquidity and the implementation of Trump-era policies, and outline relevant risk management indicators. https://en.macromicro.me/collections/4/us-employ-relative/126695/us-number-of-jobs-elon-and-doge-cut-in-2025 Major Drivers This Cycle: Legalization & Dollarization of Crypto Unlike past cycles propelled by catalysts such as DeFi (2020) or ICOs (2017), this current cycle is driven by a regulatory shift— moving from SEC crackdowns towards government support and the proposed Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The dollarization of crypto continues, acting as both an opportunity and a risk. Bitcoin, while strongly correlated with U.S. equities, previously demonstrated independent four-year cycles. The 2022 Russia-Ukraine conflict provides a notable exception, where capital controls and sanctions triggered a 12% single-day surge in Bitcoin as investors sought a hedge against fiat currency devaluation. However, more recent geopolitical events—such as the Israel-Gaza conflict and last week’s geopolitical challenges—have resulted in sharp declines in Bitcoin’s price. https://en.macromicro.me/collections/4/us-employ-relative/126695/us-number-of-jobs-elon-and-doge-cut-in-2025 Institutional investors have now become the primary drivers of Bitcoin’s price movements. This can be demonstrated by CME data, where the open interest in CME Bitcoin futures has surged from under $4 billion prior to the approval of ETFs to a consistent level above $10 billion— even reaching peaks exceeding $20 billion. A significant liquidation of basis arbitrage positions by U.S. institutions could potentially trigger a sharp price decline due to outflows from spot ETFs. This arbitrage strategy involves capitalizing on the price difference (basis) between spot ETFs and futures contracts using leverage of 3–5x. For instance, investors might take a long position in the spot ETF while simultaneously shorting CME futures, profiting from a basis that exceeds the U.S. Treasury yield (approximately 5%), thus aiming for a risk-free arbitrage. Currently, Bitcoin’s behavior mirrors that of a 3x leveraged Nasdaq: during periods of abundant liquidity, it experiences even more substantial gains than the Nasdaq, while periods of tightening liquidity lead to even more pronounced losses. https://www.coinglass.com/zh On the other hand, if we say the current beta of Nasdaq tech stocks is AI—exemplified by the upcoming release of GPT-5 and Nvidia’s monopoly — the beta of the crypto industry remains institutional inflows driven by regulatory legitimization and dollarization. Outside of memecoins, the sector has yet to see a sustainable beta like DeFi in the last cycle. Nevertheless, according to DeFiLlama, there are over 20 on-chain projects generating more than $100 million in annualized revenue. https://defillama.com Legalization and dollarization are the defining core tailwinds of this cycle. Bitcoin stands as the primary beneficiary, acting as a gateway for U.S. institutional capital through ETFs, thereby solidifying the long-term legitimacy of the U.S. crypto industry. This process is expected to generate a continuous stream of positive news and regulatory developments. However, despite this bullish trend, Bitcoin’s price will remain susceptible to short-term volatility influenced by geopolitical events and macroeconomic factors, such as changes in global liquidity. Investors aiming to maximize profits from this long-term trend should consider holding mainstream crypto assets (like Bitcoin) and selling when the core drivers reach peak impact. For risk-averse investors, closely monitoring U.S. crypto policy developments and key liquidity indicators is advisable. Expect the evolution of U.S. crypto policy to unfold throughout the entirety of a second Trump term. Proposals to finance large-scale Bitcoin purchases—similar to the accumulation of gold during the Great Depression—will require fiscal maneuvering, potentially including engineering negative GDP prints to justify monetary stimulus. Until then, the U.S. does not have an official budget allocated for sovereign Bitcoin purchases. https://en.macromicro.me/collections/4/us-employ-relative/126695/us-number-of-jobs-elon-and-doge-cut-in-2025 Trump’s Crypto Policy Execution Implemented Policies 1. The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) Progress: FIT21 is legislation crafted to establish a well-defined regulatory framework for digital assets in the United States. Its core objective is to clarify the roles of regulatory agencies—the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)—in supervising the crypto industry. Highly decentralized cryptocurrencies (with control ≤ 20%), such as ETH and SOL, would be classified as digital commodities under the CFTC’s jurisdiction. In contrast, centralized assets would fall under the SEC’s authority. The bill also incorporates a 3- to 5-year safe harbor proposal to assist projects in transitioning to a decentralized structure. Despite its passage by the House of Representatives in May 2024, the FIT21 bill still requires several more steps before it can become law. Nevertheless, given the upswell of support for it in the new administration and Congress, along with the backing of key industry players such as Coinbase and Digital Currency Group, FIT21 seems poised to become the framework for regulation of digital assets. Key Impacts: ● Market Structure Optimization : A significant number of blockchain projects will transition to CFTC regulation, thereby reducing compliance costs. For example, the Ethereum Foundation has submitted proof of decentralization, anticipating reclassification by Q2 2025. ● Innovation Incentive: The safe harbor proposal is attracting numerous new projects; several DeFi protocols within the Solana ecosystem are currently undergoing compliance-related transformations. 2. Repeal of SAB 121 Policy Implementation: In January 2025, the Trump administration, utilizing expedited congressional procedures, repealed SAB 121. This regulation had previously required banks to classify customer cryptocurrency assets as liabilities on their balance sheets, effectively hindering the provision of custodial services by traditional financial institutions. Following the repeal, major banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup announced the launch of cryptocurrency custody services, projecting over $50 billion in assets under management by the end of Q2 2025. Market Reaction: ● Institutional Liquidity Injection: The opening of bank custody channels led to a surge in inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs. For example, a BlackRock product saw net inflows of $1.2 billion within a week. 3. SEC Regulatory Adjustments Personnel Changes: Following President Trump’s inauguration, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler resigned. He was replaced by crypto-friendly Paul S. Atkins. The new leadership is expected to prioritize revising the Howey Test criteria to reduce the proportion of tokens classified as securities and to promote a regulatory framework that is more open and innovation-friendly. Regulatory Relaxation: ● Howey Test Adjustment: The new regulatory approach is considering clarifying which functional tokens may be exempt from securities registration, such as tokens used for gas fees or Ethereum staking rewards. ● ETF Expansion: Beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, discussions have included the potential for ADA, SOL, and XRP within strategic reserves. However, to maintain Bitcoin’s primacy as a strategic asset, their inclusion is less likely. Nonetheless, the market demand for ETFs on these altcoins is significant, making their approval a distinct possibility. https://www.theblockbeats.info 4. Cryptocurrency Company Listings and Capitalization Reopening of the IPO Window: ● Kraken plans to launch its IPO on the NYSE in Q3 2025, with a valuation exceeding $20 billion, underwritten by Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. ● Fireblocks is planning a Nasdaq listing via a SPAC merger, with an estimated valuation of approximately $9 billion. Entry of Traditional Capital: ● Several Wall Street investment banks (such as Morgan Stanley) have established dedicated cryptocurrency investment divisions and led Coinbase’s secondary offering. ● Sovereign wealth funds are also entering the market. For example, ADQ, an Abu Dhabi investment fund, has increased its stake in MicroStrategy by 5%, indirectly gaining exposure to Bitcoin. Unfulfilled Policies Fed Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Act Key provisions of the act include: ● Bitcoin Purchase Plan: Acquire up to 200,000 BTC annually for five years, ultimately capping the federal Bitcoin reserve at 1 million BTC, which would be about 5% of Bitcoin’s total supply. ● Secure Storage Facilities: Establish a decentralized network of secure Bitcoin storage facilities managed by the U.S. Department of the Treasury for the safe storage and flexible management of Bitcoin reserves. ● Holding Period and Usage Rules: Bitcoin acquired by the government will be held for no less than 20 years, and no Bitcoin held may be sold, swapped, or auctioned for any purpose other than to retire outstanding federal debt instruments during this period. Funding Sources: ● Direct Budgetary Appropriations: Congress could allocate funds to buy Bitcoin through the standard appropriation process. This would increase government spending, either contributing to the national deficit or necessitating budget cuts in other areas.Given the potential multi-billion dollar cost, direct appropriation is likely to face political opposition. Without a strong fiscal justification (e.g., expected high returns for debt repayment), this approach is unlikely to gain support from fiscally hawkish members of Congress. ● Reallocation and Diversification of Existing Reserve Assets: A more creative approach involves utilizing the appreciation of existing government assets to purchase Bitcoin, minimizing new spending. The BITCOIN Act proposed by Lummis exemplifies this, suggesting leveraging the unrealized gains on the U.S. gold reserve: 1. The US Treasury holds approximately 261 million troy ounces of gold, which is still valued at a historical price of $42.22 per ounce on financial statements. The current market price is significantly higher, representing substantial unrealized gains. 2. The BITCOIN Act proposes that the Federal Reserve returns gold certificates to the Treasury, revaluing the gold at market price. The difference between the old and new certificate values would be transferred to the Treasury. This could generate hundreds of billions of dollars in one-time revenue for Bitcoin purchases. This gold revaluation effectively unlocks existing asset value without incurring additional debt or raising taxes. 3. The Act also suggests lowering the cap on Federal Reserve surplus, requiring the Fed to annually transfer a portion of its profits for Bitcoin purchases. This utilizes Federal Reserve profits (which ultimately belong to the Treasury) as a funding source. 4. In summary, this plan aims to diversify existing Federal reserves and Treasury funds to finance Bitcoin purchases, rather than increasing overall government spending. This approach, through balance sheet adjustments, minimizes the direct impact on the federal deficit. However, Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent dismissed speculation about revaluing U.S. gold reserves. ● Seized and Confiscated Assets : The U.S. government is already a significant holder of Bitcoin globally, although these holdings primarily result from law enforcement seizures rather than active purchases. Seizures from cases such as Silk Road (a darknet marketplace) and the Bitfinex hack have accumulated over 200,000 BTC. By the end of 2024, the U.S. government reportedly held approximately 198,000 BTC, valued at around $17.6 billion. However, the government typically auctions seized Bitcoin (e.g., through the U.S. Marshals Service). Should Congress permit, these existing or future seized Bitcoins could be directly allocated to the strategic reserve without being sold. Historical U.S. Reserve Strategies Offer Precedents for Bitcoin as a Reserve Asset ● Historically, the U.S. government has considered the strategic use of special asset reserves to strengthen its fiscal or monetary position. The most notable example is its gold reserve. 1. During the Great Depression in the 1930s, the U.S. government enacted the “Gold Reserve Act of 1934”. Through this legislation, it significantly increased its holdings of domestic gold and artificially raised its price from $20.67 to $35 per ounce. This effectively revalued gold, generating a substantial book surplus for the Treasury. 2. This surplus was subsequently used to establish the Exchange Stabilization Fund, among other purposes, aiding the government in navigating financial difficulties. After World War II, under the Bretton Woods system, the U.S. amassed the majority of global official gold reserves, and gold became a foundational element of the U.S. dollar’s credibility. 3. Despite the dollar’s decoupling from gold in 1971, the U.S. Treasury still holds 8,133 tons of gold (approximately 261 million ounces) today. Its nominal value remains around $11 billion (at the legally fixed price), while its market value exceeds $500 billion. 4. This historical context demonstrates the U.S. government’s past willingness to allocate a portion of national wealth to scarce commodities in order to stabilize the financial system. Bitcoin proponents draw a parallel, referring to Bitcoin as “digital gold” and arguing that this historical analogy sets a precedent for government acquisition of Bitcoin—a move mirroring past increases in gold reserves to bolster national assets. ● Moreover, the U.S. government maintains the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) as a mechanism to stabilize energy markets during extraordinary periods. This serves as another example of the government holding commodity reserves for contingency purposes. Legal analysts suggest that using the oil reserve to moderate oil prices or even fund the budget (through oil sales for revenue) could provide a relevant framework for a potential Bitcoin reserve. Stablecoin Legislation: Executive Order Advances Stablecoin Legalization : In January 2025, President Trump signed an executive order with the stated objective of “promoting the development and growth of lawful and legitimate dollar-backed stablecoins worldwide,” framing this as essential for preserving the U.S. dollar’s global dominance. Concurrently, the order prohibits the research and development of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), citing potential threats to individual liberties and market competitiveness. ● Republican Senator Bill Hagerty introduced the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, a bill focused on creating a regulatory framework for stablecoins, including mandated guidelines for issuer qualifications and reserve asset custody. ● Tim Scott, Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, formed a working group and collaborated with AI and crypto ‘czar’ David Sacks to expedite the legislative process. The Trump administration aims to finalize regulatory framework proposals within six months, a timeline experts have called “lightning speed”. ● President Trump called for establishing a crypto advisory council, led by innovation-supportive industry leaders, to shape policy and encourage agencies such as the SEC to revise their regulatory approach to stablecoins. The cryptocurrency summit in March 2025 further consolidated industry feedback and aimed to finalize legislative specifics. Key Impacts: Accelerated Convergence of Traditional Finance and the Cryptocurrency Market: Legalizing stablecoins provides a legitimate pathway for banks and payment processors to participate in the cryptocurrency market, potentially catalyzing the development of more institutional-grade stablecoin offerings. For instance, the Trump administration supports commercial banks in the custody or issuance of stablecoins. Adapting Key Indicators to the Evolving Global Macroeconomic Landscape Macroeconomic Background and Indicators Interest Rate Cut Timing Hinges on Significant Economic Downturn Data Inflation data currently appears to be under control, as evidenced by the January PCE Price Index of 2.6%—the lowest since June 2024, before the previous rate cut. Despite this, the U.S. economy has not yet shown signs of entering a recession. The Federal Reserve currently forecasts two interest rate cuts in 2025, with the PCE inflation rate and non-farm payroll figures being the primary factors influencing these decisions. ● In January, U.S. non-farm payrolls increased by 143,000, and the unemployment rate declined to 4%. This contrasts with the context of the previous interest rate cut, which was widely viewed as politically motivated by Democratic election considerations, despite an above-trend economy and moderate inflation. As a result of that experience, any future rate cuts are now expected to require clear signs of a significant economic downturn, such as negative GDP growth. ● The federal workforce is projected to shrink by approximately 400,000 in 2025 due to ongoing hiring freezes, deferred resignations, and DOGE-related layoffs. These developments suggest a likely downturn in U.S. equity markets—particularly the S&P 500 and Nasdaq—even before any potential rate cuts occur. Given that the cryptocurrency market often acts as a three-times leveraged proxy of the Nasdaq, a substantial correction appears probable, with crypto markets expected to decline earlier and recover sooner than traditional equities. https://en.macromicro.me/collections/4/us-employ-relative/126695/us-number-of-jobs-elon-and-doge-cut-in-2025 ● Current U.S. 10-Year Treasury Yield Declines to 4.19%, Benchmark Interest Rate at 4.5% https://en.macromicro.me/collections/4/us-employ-relative/126695/us-number-of-jobs-elon-and-doge-cut-in-2025 TGA Replenishment Post-Debt Ceiling May Force QT Pause U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bassett has indicated that once the debt ceiling is resolved, the primary strategy will be to increase long-term Treasury issuance while reducing short-term debt. This shift in the maturity structure aims to lock in borrowing at lower long-term rates, easing refinancing pressures and reducing annual interest expenses. Functionally, this approach resembles a form of “fiscal QE,” intended to stabilize the bond market through adjusted issuance strategies. However, its implementation may be gradual. In the near term, it is not expected to significantly increase the supply of long-term Treasuries, but rather to signal a pause in quantitative tightening (QT). As of February 2025, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet had contracted from its pandemic high of approximately $9 trillion to $6.7 trillion. Since June 2024, the maximum monthly reduction in QT was lowered from $95 billion to $60 billion, allocated as $25 billion in Treasury securities and $35 billion in mortgage-backed securities (MBS). However, the actual pace of QT has been slower, averaging around $40 billion per month ($25 billion in Treasuries and $15 billion in MBS), due to factors such as bond maturities and early repayments. If this pace continues, the Fed’s total assets are projected to decline to $6.4 trillion by the end of 2025, with reserves falling to $2.7 trillion, resulting in a reserve-to-GDP ratio of about 8.8%. During the 2019 QT cycle, the Fed’s reserve-to-GDP ratio bottomed at 6.85% in Q3 2019. Currently, the ratio stands much higher at 11.19%, with reserves of $3.33 trillion. Based on the Fed’s projected 2.1% GDP growth in 2025, the reserve balance could fall to around $2.05 trillion—suggesting $1.28 trillion in remaining capacity for reserve reduction and indicating that the Fed has not yet reached its minimum comfortable level. https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_recenttrends.htm Expected End of Quantitative Tightening (QT) : Major Institutions Anticipate QT Will Conclude Primarily in Q2 2025 The main reason for this expectation is the debt ceiling trigger. Once activated, the Treasury must prioritize mandatory payments (such as interest and Social Security), leading to a rapid drawdown of the Treasury General Account (TGA). ● The Federal Reserve’s January 2025 meeting minutes revealed that some FOMC members believed QT should end sometime in 2025. If the Fed begins action in April, halting QT would inject $540 billion in liquidity into the market in 2025, compared to previous forecasts. ● Since February 11, the Treasury’s TGA balance has fallen by $240.6 billion. Ahead of a debt ceiling resolution (potentially delayed until Q3 2025), the TGA could shrink by another $400 billion, nearing historical depletion levels. This would temporarily boost liquidity and raise reserve balances, as illustrated by the short-term increase in bank reserves in the chart below: https://www.investing.com ● Upon reaching a debt ceiling agreement, the Treasury will need to replenish the TGA through significant bond issuance. This will redirect market funds back into the TGA, causing a corresponding contraction in bank reserves. ● If an agreement is reached in Q3, the Treasury may need to withdraw around $700 billion in liquidity. Combined with the Fed’s ongoing QT policy, this could amplify volatility in reserve levels and lead to a temporary pause in QT. https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WDTGAL Tax Cut Policies May Be Implemented in Q4 On February 25, 2025, the U.S. House of Representatives narrowly passed the “Big, Beautiful” Budget Bill by a vote of 217 to 215. Key proposals include: (1) Extending 2017 Tax Relief: The bill would extend the individual and corporate tax cuts from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act—originally set to expire at the end of 2025—through 2035, potentially benefiting around 30 million service workers and low-to-middle-income families. (2) New Tax Breaks: The legislation would eliminate federal taxes on overtime pay, tips, and Social Security benefits. (3) Raising the Federal Debt Limit: The bill proposes increasing the debt ceiling from $36.22 trillion to $40 trillion. (4) Increased Defense and Border Security Spending: An additional $300 billion would be allocated to defense and border security. (5) $2 Trillion in Spending Cuts: Proposed reductions include $880 billion in Medicaid, SNAP, and education spending. The bill still requires Senate review and approval. The most optimistic timeline suggests all legislative processes could conclude by Q3 2025, with implementation beginning on October 1, 2025. Conclusion Despite the absence of a defining innovation narrative akin to DeFi in this cycle, structural shifts in the regulatory landscape are reshaping the crypto startup ecosystem. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has dismissed its lawsuits against major exchanges like Coinbase and repealed the DeFi broker rule. This pivotal shift now allows previously non-compliant innovations—such as the on-chain trading of tokenized U.S. stocks—to become viable. As this more relaxed regulatory environment takes hold, it is likely to foster a new wave of organic, blockchain-native innovation, injecting fresh momentum into the crypto industry.

In its latest note, the bank estimated Binance’s BNB will reach $1,275 by the end of 2025 and a staggering $2,775 in 2028. Geoffrey Kendrick, the bank’s head of crypto research, issued an optimistic prediction that is based on the estimate that the Binance Coin remains an important benchmark for digital assets and has historically maintained a strong correlation with Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ). Between the established correlation and overall strength, Standard Chartered’s forecast can be viewed through the lens of its earlier BTC price prediction. As Finbold reported in late April, the banking giant estimates that the world’s premier cryptocurrency will climb to $200,000 by the end of 2025, and it set its sights for 2028 at $500.000. The ambitious predictions for Bitcoin would see the coin 106.31% from its press time price of $96,942 by December 31 and 415.77% within three years. Under the circumstances, the fact that the BNB forecast estimates a 110.47% rally for the token this year and 358.07% from its press time price of $605 by 2028 falls in line with the correlation thesis. Why BNB is set for a 360% three-year rally Although Standard Chartered’s Kendrick noted that BNB’s developer activity has been comparatively lacking in recent years, he opined that the upcoming Maxwell upgrade and the recent Pascal hard fork would alter the situation. Kendrick also revealed that the token’s low developer activity has been less of a hurdle than it would be for most other digital assets, thanks to its utility in the Binance cryptocurrency exchange ecosystem and use on related decentralized platforms such as PancakeSwap. BNB adoption could skyrocket in 2025 BNB could also potentially receive additional utility and see greater adoption in the relatively near future.

VanEck just filed for a spot BNB ETF pic.twitter.com/yOanuNMyjp — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) May 5, 2025 The SEC is widely expected to approve a significant set of such investment vehicles due to multiple factors, including opening the floodgates with Bitcoin and Ethereum in 2024, growing more crypto-friendly under President Donald Trump , but also due to Trump Media & Technology (NASDAQ: DJT ) partnership with Crypto.com to launch digital asset exchange-traded products (ETP). Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao has also been lobbying for nation states to adopt his company’s cryptocurrency and recommended that Kyrgyzstan include both BTC and BNB in a strategic reserve on May 5.

While it would be unfair to say the cryptocurrency has been weak, though it is 13.66% down year-to-date (YTD), it is 75.59% above the high points of its ‘crypto winter’ range between roughly $200 and $350, it has been somewhat stagnant.

Lawmakers raised concerns over potential conflicts of interest and insider profits, with the TRUMP token seeing major gains after a White House gala announcement. WLFI Plans USD1 Airdrop World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a crypto platform that is backed by members of the Trump family, is preparing to airdrop a small amount of its newly launched USD-pegged stablecoin, USD1, to early WLFI token holders. This initiative is currently undergoing a governance vote, and is intended as both a reward for early supporters and a live test of the platform’s airdrop mechanism. According to the proposal that was published on May 6 in the WLFI governance forum, the main goal of the airdrop is to validate the technical functionality of the system in real-time. With the voting set to close on May 14, the proposal already received overwhelming support, with 99.97% of votes cast in favor. This is equivalent to 2.6 billion tokens. Just 0.03%, or about 901,000 tokens, have voted against it. Vote results and timeline (Source: World Liberty Financial ) WLFI placed a lot of emphasis on just how important this test will be to ensure the readiness of its smart contracts and in introducing users to its USD1 stablecoin. While the exact amount of USD1 to be distributed is still undecided, it will be calculated based on the number of eligible wallets and the platform’s airdrop budget. The date for the airdrop is also pending, and WLFI reserves the right to halt or alter the test airdrop at any time. The platform raised $550 million through two public token sales since its September launch, and attracted a community of 85,000 registered holders. This latest proposal was made at a time of growing global interest in stablecoins, with the market cap of USD-backed tokens like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) reaching $230 billion in April, according to Citigroup . These two stablecoins alone account for 90% of the market. Meanwhile, countries are beginning to challenge US dollar dominance in the stablecoin space. Abu Dhabi recently announced a new dirham-backed stablecoin project, and Russia is exploring a ruble-pegged alternative after sanctions that led to frozen wallets on Garantex and associated USDT accounts. Democrats Target Trump’s Crypto Empire While the crypto community seems impressed with the Trump-backed WLFI’s airdrop plan, not everyone is impressed with the President’s crypto involvement. Democrat lawmakers in the United States launched a coordinated effort to scrutinize and potentially restrict President Donald Trump’s involvement in cryptocurrency ventures. Two new legislative proposals and a subcommittee investigation were launched to cut off his ability to profit from projects like the Trump-branded meme coin and the WLFI platform. On May 6, Senator Chris Murphy introduced the Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement Act (MEME Act), which seeks to bar federal officials and their immediate families from promoting or profiting from digital assets, including meme coins. The bill proposes civil penalties of up to $250,000 and the forfeiture of any profits to the US Treasury, as well as possible criminal consequences including fines and prison sentences of up to five years. Representative Sam Liccardo submitted companion legislation in the House. However, with Republicans controlling both chambers, the proposals face an uphill battle. On the same day, Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal announced a preliminary inquiry by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI) into several Trump-affiliated crypto initiatives, including the Official Trump (TRUMP) token and WLFI. The PSI sent document requests to the firms behind these projects, demanding records of communications with the Trump organization and clarity on steps taken to mitigate potential conflicts of interest. The subcommittee is particularly focused on the surge in TRUMP token value after an April 23 announcement that the top 220 holders will be invited to a gala dinner at the White House. This caused the token to spike almost 50% from $9.40 to $13.65. The TRUMP token launched on Jan. 18 and once peaked at $73.43. TRUMP all-time price action (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Despite the price drop from its all-time high, blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis reports that more than half of TRUMP token holders are in profit. Approximately two million wallets purchased the token, with 54,000 new wallets joining after the dinner announcement. Among them, 58 major investors collectively made over $1.1 billion in profits, each earning more than $10 million. The meme coin’s creator earned $320 million to date, with $1.3 million added since the dinner news. Meanwhile, a new player entered the scene. Trucking logistics company Freight Technologies announced on April 30 that it plans to build a $20 million TRUMP token treasury via a convertible note issuance. The firm’s CEO, Javier Selgas, described the token as a means of diversifying its crypto holdings and supporting fair trade policies. Earlier, on April 1, the company also purchased $5.2 million worth of Fetch.ai's FET token. Lawmakers Also Question MELANIA Meme Coin Meanwhile, a group of crypto traders reportedly made around $100 million in profits by purchasing large amounts of Melania Trump’s meme coin, MELANIA, just minutes before its official launch announcement. According to a May 6 report by the Financial Times, the traders spent approximately $2.6 million to buy 16.7 million of the 200 million total MELANIA tokens slated for sale during the launch period on Jan. 19. MELANIA all-time price action (Source: CoinMarketCap ) The token's price soared from around $2.00 to $12.95 shortly after Melania Trump publicized it on social media, which was a 550% spike. The group allegedly liquidated their positions in the 12 hours of the announcement. In addition, 22 more accounts reportedly bought close to $900,000 worth of MELANIA tokens 42 seconds after the token went live. The MELANIA token was launched just two days after Donald Trump, then president-elect, announced his own TRUMP token, and both have since drawn a lot of scrutiny from lawmakers. Critics argue the projects raise concerns about conflicts of interest, foreign influence, and potential corruption. Although the First Lady appears less central to the backlash, most of the criticism is centered on Donald Trump himself Since their launch, both tokens saw dramatic declines. MELANIA is currently trading at just $0.31, while TRUMP, despite a brief surge after the dinner announcement, fell to $10.90. Even more controversy surrounds the TRUMP token as two companies linked to the president reportedly control around 80% of its supply. Although a large portion of those tokens are locked and set to vest over the next three years, some critics warn that project insiders still have the potential to rug-pull unsuspecting investors.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MINING|REGULATION|TRADING|AIRDROP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-07 09:24:13

The project is currently at phase 4 with a token price of $0.025 while selling more than 443 million tokens due to strong market interest in crypto. The decentralized finance (DeFi) project has become a hot investing destination as SOL and ETH token holders find promise in its structured tokenomics that predicts a 140% profit opportunity when it lists at $0.06. Phase 5 approaches while phase 4 remains more than half completed leading to speculations about a token price increase from $0.025 to $0.03. The strong market interest surrounding Mutuum Finance (MUTM) creates predictions that this project will yield remarkable growth to reach $3 by 2025. But what drives this enthusiasm? Mutuum Finance’s Lending Model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out by providing an innovative lending platform to its users. The platform allows users to put their ETH tokens into the mtToken system that generates passive income through accumulated interest payments. The crypto tokens serve as universal assets that increase liquidity while offering enhanced flexibility to DeFi users. The lending process includes borrowers securing loans through assets that maintain higher value than borrowed amounts for lender protection. The team strengthens trust by initiating a CertiK smart contract audit which will reveal its results on social channels. Securing the network is a core project focus at Mutuum Finance (MUTM) which separates it from traditional volatile crypto markets. The available entry option at $0.025 through phase 4 approaches capacity which accelerates investor urgency to make a quick investment. Tokenomics and Buy Pressure Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) structured development approach creates its fundamental attraction. Investors in phase 4 stock can expect to earn a 20% profit from the phase 5 price change to $0.03 and they will receive at least 140% in profit if the token reaches $0.06 on the market. After the project launch early investors stand to receive a 11,900% ROI due to analysts predicting $3 as the next price point. Through this mechanism the platform distributes profits from its operations to purchase MUTM tokens while distributing rewards to mtToken stakers. The MUTM dashboard presented recently allows top 50 token holders to receive additional tokens when they maintain their position leading to elevated competition within the network. The combination of gamified and powerful tokenomics functions to create lasting demand which turns Mutuum Finance (MUTM) into an attractive choice for experienced crypto investors. Racing Toward a 50x Future Mutuum Finance (MUTM) shows rapid growth through its phases leading to phase 5 as the current phase 4 price of $0.025 continues to decrease.

The S&P 500 index shed 0.77% in Wednesday’s pre-market session, while the global crypto market cap recorded a 1.26% increase in the last 24 hours to cross $3 trillion. According to the Wall Street Journal, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are set to hold discussions with China’s top economic official on Thursday. News of the talks, expected to take place in Zurich, started a rally in stock-index futures overnight, correcting two consecutive days of market declines. Stock futures rebound after consecutive market losses Following the announcement of the US-China planned meeting, S&P 500 futures climbed approximately 0.8%, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose 196 points, or 0.42%. Nasdaq 100 futures advanced by 0.48%. The rebound comes after Tuesday’s regular session saw losses across all major US indexes. The Dow had dropped nearly 400 points, or 0.9%, while the S&P 500 slid by 0.8%. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.9%, pulled lower by a selloff in Palantir shares that saw disappointing earnings. Investor sentiment had already been rattled by macroeconomic concerns and a lack of progress on trade deals. Earlier in the day, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney met with President Donald Trump at the White House. Carney pushed back against provocative comments from the US president asking Canada to be absorbed as the 51st US state, saying his country “isn’t for sale.” On the digital asset side, the altcoin market cap broke out of a prolonged falling wedge pattern, but faces headwinds at the 21-day and 50-day moving averages, acting as resistance levels. #ALTS MARKET CAP ANALYSIS The ALTS market cap has broken out of a falling wedge pattern with strong volume, indicating potential bullish momentum.

The coin is still in a consolidation phase after rallying briefly in late April back up to $90,000. Bitcoin is trading just above the $96,800 resistance zone and has been oscillating in a tight range, but the overall structure remains bullish. It continues to hold the $91,000 support level, well above both its 100-day and 200-day moving averages. No major signs of bearish reversal or a deeper pullback are visible on the daily chart. Corporate America struggles with trade uncertainty Several US companies are reportedly still assessing the “damage” done by tariffs and geopolitical uncertainty, and look more likely to revise their forecasts for the fiscal year 2025. Automaker Ford projected that tariffs could reduce one of its core profit measures by as much as $1.5 billion. Ford shares surprisingly rose 2.7% before markets opened on Wednesday. Toy giant Mattel saw a 2.8% gain after revealing plans to raise prices and shift production out of China to counter an expected $270 million tariff burden. US Fed meeting in focus Meanwhile, attention is turning to the Federal Reserve, whose two-day policy meeting began Tuesday. The central bank is expected to hold interest rates steady, but markets are awaiting Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference for any insight into the Fed’s stance on inflation and economic risks stemming from the trade conflict.

Keeping an eye on the pulse of the US spot Bitcoin ETF market is crucial for understanding broader sentiment. After a brief period of positive momentum, the market saw a notable shift on May 6th. Understanding the Recent Bitcoin ETF Outflows Following three consecutive trading days of net inflows, the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF landscape experienced a reversal on May 6th, recording a combined net outflow of $86.21 million. This data, shared by market observer Trader T on X, indicates a change in investor behavior during this specific trading session. Let’s break down where these movements occurred: Grayscale’s GBTC: Continued to see significant exits, leading the pack with $89.92 million in net outflows. ARK Invest’s ARKB: Reported net outflows totaling $16.12 million. Franklin Templeton’s EZBC: Saw net outflows amounting to $8.26 million. VanEck’s HODL: Also registered net outflows, coming in at $8.07 million. These outflows collectively outweighed the inflows seen elsewhere in the market. Where Did the Money Go? Analyzing IBIT Inflows Despite the overall net outflow day, not all funds experienced withdrawals. BlackRock’s IBIT, one of the largest and most popular spot Bitcoin ETFs, continued to attract capital, recording a net inflow of $36.16 million. This highlights continued demand for BlackRock’s offering even as other funds saw redemptions. The remaining spot Bitcoin ETFs tracked in the report showed no change in their holdings for the day. What Do These Movements Mean for the Crypto Market Trends ? While a single day of outflows doesn’t necessarily signal a major trend reversal, it’s a data point worth noting. After several days of positive flows, which can often correlate with positive price action or sentiment for Bitcoin, a day of net outflows suggests some investors took profits or adjusted positions. The persistent GBTC outflows remain a factor influencing the overall market dynamics of these funds, often offsetting inflows into products like IBIT. Monitoring these daily flow figures provides insight into the institutional and retail demand for direct Bitcoin exposure via these regulated investment vehicles. They act as a proxy for sentiment and capital allocation within the digital asset space. Summary: A Closer Look at Spot Bitcoin ETF Flows May 6th marked a pause in the recent trend of positive net inflows for US spot Bitcoin ETFs, with the market experiencing $86.21 million in total net outflows. This shift was primarily driven by significant outflows from GBTC, alongside smaller outflows from ARKB, EZBC, and HODL, despite continued positive flows into IBIT. Keeping track of these flows is essential for understanding the evolving dynamics of the US spot Bitcoin ETF market and its potential impact on broader Crypto market trends .

Rumors started circulating on May 4 that Zerebro ( ZEREBRO ) co-founder Jeffy Yu had committed a suicide during a livestream on the memecoin launch platform Pump.fun . A video that appeared to show Yu smoking a cigarette and then shooting himself in the neck spread rapidly on crypto X. While some were skeptical, many believed it to be genuine — especially after Yu’s obituary was published two days later on the memorial platform Legacy. However, mounting evidence now suggests the reports of his death may have been fabricated. First, the Legacy obituary is no longer available. More tellingly, on-chain data shows that multiple transactions tied to Yu’s wallet were executed after his alleged death. According to Lookonchain , a wallet likely tied to Yu sold 35.55 million ZEREBRO tokens for 8,572 SOL (approximately $1.27 million), and subsequently transferred 7,100 SOL (around $1.06 million) to the development wallet of LLJEFFY, a coin Yu launched on the day of his alleged suicide. Blockchain analytics firm Bubblemaps also reported that the LLJEFFY deployer and associated wallets were actively trading and burning tokens after Yu’ alleged death. One wallet, 5Ko12, alone sold over $170,000 worth of ZEREBRO across multiple transactions. Source: @bubblemaps You might also like: Zerebro founder Jeffy Yu reportedly suicides on livestream, after launching a ‘legacoin’ In addition to on-chain signs, an unverified letter allegedly written by Jeffy Yu to investors is currently circulating on X. In that letter, Yu says he staged the suicide video as a deliberate act to exit the crypto space, stating: “I created a video in which I depict myself shooting myself. My decision to create and indirectly disseminate this video was deliberate. In my perspective, this was my only viable exit from persistent harassment, blackmail, and threats.” He also explains that leaving publicly without triggering further backlash and doxxing was impossible: “Had I stepped away openly, I would have tanked the price of ZEREBRO and OPAIUM projects when my departure became imminent. This would have resulted in even more intense targeting, which was previously evidenced when out token price >90% in January, causing a massive increase in resentment towards me as a developer.” Source: @beaniemaxi Meanwhile, ZEREBRO and OPAIUM tokens have both tanked 20% in the past 24 hours, while the new coin LLJEFFY is up over 100% over the same period and 24% in the past hour alone.

At the time of writing, BTC is changing hands at $96,500, posting a modest 3% gain over the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. Bitfinex, in its latest markets report , called the $95,000 zone a “critical pivot” for Bitcoin, noting it forms the lower boundary of a price range that held from November 2024 through February 2025. A sustained move above it could signal a structural return to bullish conditions and set the stage for a retest of the $109,000 all-time high, achieved in January just before President Trump’s inauguration. But the optimism is tempered. “Failure to hold above $95K could flip the zone into resistance,” Bitfinex warned, opening the door to another leg of corrective downside. The next few trading sessions are likely to be pivotal, as the market decides whether to charge toward new highs or retreat to lower support levels. $98K Could Trigger Bitcoin Short Liquidations As Bitcoin flirts with $97,000, the short sellers are sweating. Crypto analyst Thomas Fahrer flagged $98,000 as the pressure point where nearly $400 million in short positions risk being wiped out. “Send it,” he posted on X, hinting at a possible squeeze that could rapidly accelerate price action. The mood among analysts is cautiously bullish. Back in March, Real Vision’s Jamie Coutts projected a potential top of $123,000 by June under favorable conditions. Swan Bitcoin CEO Cory Klippsten offered a 50% chance for new all-time highs before the month closes. With BTC now inching toward six figures, those projections are being revisited with fresh conviction. Rate Decision Looms, Sentiment Tilts Greedy Adding to the uncertainty is today’s Federal Reserve interest rate decision, a potential volatility trigger that markets will be watching closely. While the CME FedWatch Tool suggests slim odds of a rate cut, even a neutral tone could embolden crypto bulls further. Meanwhile, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index jumped 8 points to 67 in the past 24 hours—firmly in “Greed” territory. Sentiment is rising, and all eyes are on whether Bitcoin can finally crack the $100,000 psychological barrier.

Market experts predict that both altcoins will deliver powerful profit growth through 2025. DOGE indicates substantial price potential through technical indicators yet Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gives investors a lending option that drives market demand. These crypto projects are distinctive in the investment landscape because they present attractive yield opportunities to potential investors. Here’s an analysis with an assessment of DOGE since its price rose from $0.129 in April and the future potential of Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Dogecoin’s bullish surge Dogecoin continues to strengthen as it jumps 38% higher than its April minimum value of $0.129. DOGE demonstrates positive technical signals because it maintains a position above the $0.138 0.382 Fibonacci support level. The previous resistance zone transformed into an entry position which users can use to advance their performance. The market analysts predict an astounding 2,087% price increase for Dogecoin to reach $3.94 through incoming Federal Reserve decisions to reduce interest rates. The performance of Bitcoin restricts the enhancement potential of DOGE. A Bitcoin dominance peak may lead to DOGE price growth yet the currency remains prone to unstable market movements. MUTM provides a new assurance driven from practical applications. Mutuum Finance’s presale frenzy Mutuum Finance (MUTM) currently attracts significant interest during its phase 4 presale as investors have already purchased 60% of the tokens that costs $0.025 with a promised phase 5 price increase. Investors show intense interest because the upcoming phase 5 price hike to $0.03 will give current buyers a 20% return on their investment. The MUTM project has earned $7.7 million through 9,500 members who have acquired 444 million tokens in its fundraising campaign. Following the release of a new dashboard system Mutuum Finance offers bonus tokens to the top 50 holders who succeed in keeping their positions. Increased urgency takes hold because phase 4 is set to complete its distribution quickly. The project contains structured tokenomics that indicate a 140% return on investment when tokens list at $0.06 yet some analysts predict the price might escalate to $2 post-launch which would represent a 7,900% ROI. A rising market sentiment creates the foundation for its future success as a DeFi model. Mutuum Finance’s DeFi edge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) enters the market through its development of a lending and borrowing platform which appeals to a specific sector. The platform provides passive earnings to its users through safe loans with more assets than needed. Revenue from the buy-and-distribute system allows Mutuum Finance to repurchase MUTM tokens which creates demand rises while giving staking rewards to users. CertiK will complete an audit of Mutuum Finance smart contracts that will be released to social users in the near future. The emphasis on safety enables better trust from investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) delivers practical utility through its structured lending and borrowing platform which offers a steady investment option for long-term growth even though Dogecoin has shown speculative market fluctuations. Seizing altcoin potential Dogecoin has achieved technical breakout and Mutuum Finance is delivering its DeFi invention to create new enthusiasm across the cryptocurrency domain. The 20x price rally potential of DOGE depends on market-wide catalysts but MUTM produces structured profit by combining presale activities with lending operations. The near expiration of Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) phase 4 presale joined with potential DOGE momentum provides investors an opportunity to secure substantial returns for 2025. Research both projects thoroughly and consider their unique strengths before diving in.

On X, Ayotte proclaimed, ‘New Hampshire is once again First in the Nation! Just signed a new law allowing our state to invest in cryptocurrency and precious metals.’ This move positions New Hampshire as a progressive state in the digital asset space. Legal expert Fred Rispoli, well-known within the XRP and crypto communities, took to X to share his insights on the potential implications of this new law for XRP. Rispoli stated, ‘According to this law that was passed, if $XRP hits a $500B market cap this year, then it is also eligible for the NH digital asset strategic reserve in 2026!’ His post has garnered widespread attention, fueling discussions about XRP’s future. According to this law that was passed, if $XRP hits a $500B market cap this year then it is also eligible for the NH digital asset strategic reserve in 2026! https://t.co/urYEFb0K6Q — Fred Rispoli (@freddyriz) May 7, 2025 New Hampshire’s Strategic Move into Digital Assets New Hampshire’s decision to permit state investments in cryptocurrency and precious metals marks a bold step towards embracing digital finance. This legal structure may position the state as a leader in blockchain innovation, attracting investment from institutions and individuals. New Hampshire’s decision to include cryptocurrency in its investment portfolio could pave the way for other states. It signifies growing governmental acceptance of digital assets, highlighting the shift towards integrating cryptocurrencies into more traditional financial frameworks. XRP’s Market Cap Milestone: A Gateway to the Reserve Fred Rispoli’s statement sheds light on a specific clause within the new law. Should XRP achieve a $500 billion market cap within the year, it would meet the criteria for inclusion in New Hampshire’s digital asset strategic reserve by 2026. This revelation has invigorated the XRP community, implying that substantial growth in XRP’s market value could align with long-term state investment strategies. Rispoli’s perspective emphasizes the importance of the current market trajectory and XRP’s potential to break into new valuation territory. While XRP’s market cap is much lower, ongoing developments in Ripple and the crypto market could propel it toward this target. Why This Matters for Ripple and XRP Classifying XRP as a strategic reserve asset would be a groundbreaking win for Ripple. Not only would it reinforce XRP’s utility and legitimacy, but it would also establish it as a significant player within state financial mechanisms. This development could encourage other states to consider similar measures, further integrating XRP into mainstream finance. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Moreover, a successful push towards this market cap could attract greater institutional participation, solidifying XRP’s position as a valuable digital asset. It could also alleviate some regulatory uncertainty that has historically hindered Ripple’s expansion within the United States. Community Reactions and Future Implications The response from the XRP community has been overwhelmingly positive, with many expressing excitement over the possibility of state-backed XRP adoption. Though reaching a $500 billion market cap is uncertain, the idea has reignited excitement. Should New Hampshire’s strategic reserve eventually include XRP, it would signal a paradigm shift in how government entities perceive digital assets. As the crypto space evolves, developments like this could shape the future of blockchain adoption at the state level. Fred Rispoli’s insight into the new law underscores the potential impact of New Hampshire’s progressive stance on cryptocurrencies. With a projected market cap, XRP could be a key component of the state’s digital asset reserve plan by 2026. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, developments like this will undoubtedly shape the trajectory of digital finance in the United States.

Optimism has returned to the broader crypto market as investors anticipate diplomatic talks between US and Chinese officials this weekend aimed at easing trade tensions. The global cryptocurrency market capitalization has climbed to $3 trillion, up 2.48% over the last 24 hours. Trading activity has also picked up, with total market volume rising to $83.3 billion, a 30.16% increase. However, caution persists ahead of the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision due later today, which could inject volatility into risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Amid the rebound, market sentiment is diverging for two coins. Concerns continue to mount over Cardano’s trajectory, while PepeX is seeing a rise in investor interest, buoyed by growing community momentum. Cardano may see a fall Cardano (ADA) faces downside risk as Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade goes live on May 7, with historical trends suggesting that major improvements to the Ethereum network often coincide with pressure on ADA. Despite this, Cardano was trading 2% higher intraday at press time. The long-standing competition between Cardano and Ethereum, both among the earliest layer-one blockchains, has frequently seen ADA underperform during key Ethereum upgrades aimed at enhancing scalability and usability. Cardano saw sharp declines following Ethereum’s London upgrade in 2021, the Merge in 2022, and the Dencun upgrade last year, which was followed by a 65% drop. If the pattern repeats, ADA may face a significant decline, especially if it breaks below key support levels. A drop to around $0.66 could trigger long liquidations totaling over $5.4 million, potentially accelerating selling pressure. Analyst Kamil commented that “ADA traders are playing with fire,” citing the high leverage in the market that could amplify volatility.

In a segment largely driven by hype and speculative surges, the absence of structural safeguards has left investors vulnerable. Launchpads such as Pump.fun have faced growing criticism for enabling rapid rollouts of poorly conceived tokens with minimal oversight or accountability. PepeX is positioning itself as a professional-grade alternative, retaining the speculative appeal of meme coins while embedding operational discipline. The platform allocates 95% of each token’s supply to the community, reserving just 5% for project founders. If a token fails to gain traction, its locked liquidity is redistributed to participants, introducing a rare mechanism of accountability in an otherwise opaque landscape. The platform is also leveraging artificial intelligence to modernize meme coin marketing. Its proprietary tool, AKIRA, integrates with Telegram and X (formerly Twitter) accounts to autonomously execute community growth strategies. This removes the need for dedicated marketing teams and enables immediate scalability from launch. By combining investor protection, automated marketing, and community-first tokenomics, PepeX is aiming to legitimize a historically volatile segment of the crypto market. Its presale has raised over $2 million to date, signaling strong investor interest in a launchpad focused on transparency and builder credibility.

44273011,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157987,1746610838,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,South Korea Faces Alarming Capital Outflows Driven by Stablecoins,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/south-korea-stablecoin-outflows/,"South Korea is currently grappling with a significant financial challenge: increasing capital outflows South Korea driven primarily by the rising popularity and attractive yields offered by stablecoins on offshore cryptocurrency exchanges. This trend is not just an economic statistic; it’s a real concern for the nation’s financial stability and the future of its currency, the won. What’s Driving Capital Outflows South Korea? The core issue stems from the differential in investment returns. Traditional banking products in South Korea offer relatively modest interest rates. In contrast, many offshore crypto exchanges South Korea provide staking or lending products for stablecoins (cryptocurrencies pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar) that boast significantly higher yields. For investors seeking better returns, moving capital into these stablecoin products becomes an attractive option. Consider the simple economics: Local Banks: Low single-digit interest rates on deposits. Offshore Stablecoin Products: Potentially much higher yields, sometimes ranging from mid to high single digits, or even higher depending on the platform and specific product. This yield gap incentivizes individuals and potentially institutions to convert their South Korean won into stablecoins like USDT or USDC and transfer them to platforms outside the country to earn these higher returns. This movement of funds constitutes a capital outflow. Understanding Stablecoin Risks South Korea Faces The implications of this trend are far-reaching. A recent paper from Hashed Open Research (HOR) highlighted the specific dangers posed by U.S. dollar-pegged South Korea stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) to the nation’s financial ecosystem. The report paints a concerning picture of potential instability. Key risks identified by HOR include: Weakening of the Won: As more capital leaves the country to chase stablecoin yields, demand for the won decreases relative to the demand for stablecoins (and ultimately, the USD they are pegged to). This can put downward pressure on the won’s exchange rate. Loss of Monetary Control: The South Korean central bank has tools to manage the money supply and influence interest rates for the won. However, these tools have limited effect on capital held and traded in offshore stablecoins. A significant shift of economic activity into stablecoins could erode the central bank’s ability to manage its own currency effectively. Blurring the Lines Between Economies: Continued large-scale capital outflows could increasingly integrate the South Korean economy with the offshore crypto economy, making it harder to distinguish between traditional financial activities and crypto-based ones. This lack of clear separation can create regulatory challenges and systemic risks. Systemic Risk: While stablecoins aim for stability, they are not without risk. Issues with reserves, regulatory crackdowns, or platform failures on offshore exchanges could have ripple effects, potentially impacting South Korean investors and, if the scale is large enough, the broader financial system. The HOR paper serves as a stark warning that ignoring the growing influence of South Korea stablecoins and the resulting outflows could have tangible negative consequences for the country’s economic sovereignty and stability. South Korea’s Potential Response: A National CBDC? Recognizing these pressing challenges, South Korea is reportedly exploring countermeasures. One significant consideration is the potential launch of its own state-backed digital currency, often referred to as a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). A South Korea CBDC could serve multiple purposes in addressing the stablecoin challenge: Offering a Domestic Digital Alternative: A won-pegged CBDC could provide a digital form of the national currency that is as convenient and potentially as innovative as stablecoins, but remains within the domestic financial system and under the central bank’s control. Competing on Features: While a CBDC might not directly offer the high yields seen on offshore platforms (as it would likely be a liability of the central bank, similar to physical cash), it could offer other benefits like instant settlement, reduced transaction costs, and programmable features that could make it attractive for various use cases, potentially reducing the reliance on foreign stablecoins for domestic transactions or innovations. Strengthening Financial Sovereignty: By providing a robust, digital form of the won, a CBDC could help reinforce the won’s usability in the digital age and counter the encroachment of foreign-pegged digital currencies into the domestic economy. Improving Data and Oversight: A CBDC could offer the central bank greater visibility into digital transaction flows within the economy, providing better data for monetary policy decisions and potentially aiding in combating illicit finance. The consideration of a South Korea CBDC signals that the government and financial authorities are taking the threat of capital outflows and the growing influence of stablecoins seriously. It’s a complex undertaking, involving significant technological, regulatory, and societal considerations, but it represents a proactive step towards maintaining control over the nation’s financial future in a rapidly evolving digital landscape. The Role of Offshore Crypto Exchanges South Korea Investors Use It’s important to note that the issue isn’t necessarily the stablecoins themselves, but the platforms and products offering high yields outside of South Korea’s regulatory purview. Offshore crypto exchanges South Korea residents can access provide the infrastructure where these yield-generating activities occur. While offering potential benefits to individual investors through higher returns, their operation outside of domestic regulation creates a blind spot for South Korean authorities regarding capital flows and associated risks. This situation highlights a global challenge for regulators: how to manage the interaction between domestically regulated financial systems and the largely unregulated, borderless world of decentralized finance and offshore crypto platforms. The yield differential is a powerful incentive that regulation alone within a single country struggles to contain. Conclusion: Navigating the Digital Tide South Korea finds itself at a critical juncture, where the allure of high yields on South Korea stablecoins held on offshore crypto exchanges South Korea can access is leading to concerning capital outflows South Korea needs to address. The stablecoin risks South Korea faces, as highlighted by research, are not theoretical; they pose a tangible threat to the won’s stability and the nation’s financial autonomy. The exploration of a South Korea CBDC represents a strategic move to adapt to this new reality, aiming to offer a domestic digital alternative that can compete for usability and relevance in the digital economy. The outcome of this challenge will likely influence how other nations approach the intersection of traditional finance, stablecoins, and the broader crypto market. The situation in South Korea serves as a compelling case study for regulators and policymakers worldwide, demonstrating the complex interplay between technological innovation, economic incentives, and the imperative of maintaining national financial stability in the digital age.

Technical indicators are mixed: The RSI is near 46, and the MACD has issued a bearish crossover, underscoring indecision below $0.75. Whale Accumulation Signals Confidence Whales added some 410 million ADA in April, per a post by analyst Ali Martinez on X (formerly Twitter). On‑chain snapshots confirm this increase: addresses holding 10M–100M ADA increased their stake by about 420 million ADA, valuing the buy at roughly $289 million. Source: Ali Martinez Smaller “whale” wallets (1 M–10 M ADA) also increased, from 2,405 to 2,408 addresses. This level of accumulation suggests large investors view current prices as attractive entry points, which is historically a precursor to strong price moves. ADA trades at $0.68, with a $24 billion market cap and 0.96% dominance in the crypto market. It’s consolidating between $0.66 (support) and $0.75 (resistance). The 200‑day SMA sits near $0.77—an important barrier for bulls . With volume, a break above $0.75 could clear the path to $0.80 and set sights on $1.00. On the downside, a drop below $0.66 risks a deeper retracement to $0.60 or $0.54, in line with recent channel lows . Daily RSI hovers around 46, while the MACD shows a bearish crossover, indicating short‑term momentum favors bears. Cardano’s network remains active despite a cooling on‑chain usage. Daily active addresses declined from 50,000 in late April to 42,000 by May ­­1, reflecting softer retail engagement. Yet DeFi’s total value locked on Cardano stands at $331 million, which is up 6.7% weekly, driven by new staking and smart‑contract deployments. The Lace wallet’s Bitcoin support launch and rising developer activity bolster long‑term fundamentals. Is $1 ADA Price Within Reach? Short term, ADA may trade sideways between $0.66 and $0.75. A decisive break above $0.75 could trigger a rally to $0.80 and potentially $1.00 if market conditions remain bullish and whale demand persists. Source: X Conversely, failure at resistance could see a pullback toward $0.60 or lower. Traders should closely watch whale wallets, volume trends, and the $0.75–$0.77 zone. With large holders accumulating heavily, Cardano has the fuel for a breakout—but only if it clears critical technical barriers.",Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano,EN,0,0,ADA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-07 09:49:30
44273251,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157989,1746611441,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Lista DAO Seals Crucial Partnership with World Liberty Financial,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/lista-dao-partnership-announcement/,"In a move set to ripple through the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape, Lista DAO , the issuer behind the overcollateralized stablecoin lisUSD, has officially announced a strategic partnership with World Liberty Financial (WLFI) . This collaboration brings together two notable entities in the crypto space, promising new opportunities and integrations for users. What is the Core of the Lista DAO and World Liberty Financial Alliance? The foundation of this exciting new alliance was revealed via Lista DAO’s official communication channels. The core of the partnership centers around the integration of WLFI’s fully backed stablecoin, USD1, into the Lista DAO ecosystem. World Liberty Financial, for context, is a crypto project that has garnered attention due to its association with the Trump family, adding a unique dimension to this collaboration within the broader crypto narrative. This strategic alignment isn’t just a handshake; it involves tangible product integrations designed to enhance the utility and reach of both platforms. The immediate result of this partnership is the live availability of WLFI’s USD1 stablecoin within a vault on the Lista DAO platform. This allows Lista DAO users to interact directly with the USD1 asset. Exploring the Benefits of the lisUSD Stablecoin Integration Lista DAO is well-known for its lisUSD stablecoin , a decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin designed to maintain a stable value relative to the US dollar. The integration of another stablecoin, USD1, into the Lista DAO ecosystem offers several potential benefits: Increased Stablecoin Diversity: Users on Lista DAO now have access to an additional stablecoin option, potentially offering more flexibility depending on their needs and trust assumptions regarding different stablecoin issuers. Enhanced Liquidity Prospects: The planned launch of a USD1/lisUSD liquidity pool is a significant development. Liquidity pools are crucial for efficient trading and swapping between assets. A robust pool between these two stablecoins would facilitate seamless exchanges, benefiting users of both assets. Expanded Collateral Options: Perhaps one of the most impactful aspects for DeFi users is the intention to add USD1 as eligible collateral within Lista DAO’s collateralized debt position (CDP) system. This means users could potentially deposit USD1 to borrow lisUSD, expanding the ways users can leverage their assets within the Lista DAO protocol. The partnership leverages the strengths of both platforms: Lista DAO’s established CDP and stablecoin infrastructure and WLFI’s USD1 stablecoin and growing community. Such integrations are vital for the continued growth and interconnectedness of the DeFi space. What Does This Crypto Partnership Mean for the Ecosystem? Every crypto partnership , especially one involving established protocols and newer, high-profile projects, sends signals to the market. This collaboration between Lista DAO and World Liberty Financial highlights a few key trends: Interoperability is Key: DeFi protocols are increasingly looking to integrate with other assets and platforms to offer more value to their users. Stablecoins, being fundamental building blocks of DeFi, are often central to these integrations. Stablecoin Competition and Collaboration: While stablecoins compete for market share, partnerships like this show that collaboration is also possible, creating synergies that benefit users through increased utility and liquidity. Growing Influence of Politically-Linked Projects: The association of WLFI with the Trump family brings a layer of political relevance to the crypto space, indicating that projects with such ties are actively seeking integration within the existing DeFi infrastructure. This could potentially onboard new demographics into DeFi. The partnership’s success will likely depend on the smooth technical implementation of the liquidity pool and CDP integrations, as well as the market’s reception to the USD1/lisUSD pairing and USD1 as collateral. How Will This Impact Users on Lista DAO? For existing users of Lista DAO, this partnership directly translates to more options and potential avenues for yield or leverage. The availability of the USD1 vault is an immediate benefit, offering a place to hold or potentially utilize USD1 within the Lista ecosystem. Looking ahead, the USD1/lisUSD liquidity pool will create opportunities for liquidity providers to earn fees, and the inclusion of USD1 as CDP collateral will provide an alternative asset users can lock up to mint lisUSD. New users interested in World Liberty Financial’s USD1 stablecoin might now be incentivized to explore the Lista DAO platform to utilize their USD1 in DeFi applications, thereby expanding Lista DAO’s user base. This cross-pollination is a common goal of strategic partnerships in the crypto space. Looking Ahead: The Future of USD1 and lisUSD in DeFi The integration of USD1 into Lista DAO is a significant step for both projects. For World Liberty Financial, it provides a direct link into a well-established DeFi protocol, increasing the utility and visibility of their stablecoin. For Lista DAO, it diversifies the assets available on its platform and potentially attracts a new segment of users interested in USD1. The successful launch and adoption of the USD1/lisUSD liquidity pool and the use of USD1 as collateral will be key metrics to watch. These integrations will truly solidify USD1’s place within the Lista DAO ecosystem and provide a real-world use case for the WLFI stablecoin within decentralized finance. This collaboration underscores the dynamic nature of the DeFi market, where protocols constantly seek innovative ways to expand their offerings and build bridges between different assets and communities. The Lista DAO and World Liberty Financial partnership is a prime example of this ongoing evolution. Summary: A Strategic Step Forward for Lista DAO and WLFI In conclusion, the strategic partnership between Lista DAO and World Liberty Financial marks an important development for both entities and the broader DeFi space. By integrating WLFI’s USD1 stablecoin into the Lista DAO platform through vaults, upcoming liquidity pools, and future collateral options, the collaboration aims to enhance stablecoin utility, increase liquidity, and expand user options. This move not only strengthens Lista DAO’s position as a key player in the stablecoin and CDP market but also provides World Liberty Financial’s USD1 with significant exposure within a reputable DeFi protocol. As the planned integrations roll out, the market will be watching closely to see the full impact of this intriguing alliance.

In a recent X post on May 7, the former Binance CEO proposed lowering gas fees on the BSC Chain to his followers. According to data from Y Charts, BSC Chain’s average gas price sits at 2.163 Gwei, down 3.91% from yesterday’s average which was at 2.251 Gwei. Compared to last year, BSC Chain’s gas fee has gone down 41.40% from 3.691 Gwei. BSC Chain gas fees | Source: Y Charts In the context of BSC Chain, Gwei is a unit of BNB ( BNB ) used to measure gas fees, similar to how it’s used on Ethereum ( ETH ). It’s essentially a standardized unit used to measure the cost of processing transactions on the network. One Gwei is equal to around 0.000000001 BNB. “Let’s reduce BSC gas fees? by 3x, 10x?” wrote Zhao on his official account. His prompt was met with mixed reception, as some traders on X urged the current head of YZi Labs to waive gas fees entirely. In response, the Binance founder said that deploying zero gas fees would be out of the question, considering the network would still need to support validators and builders. “Lots of spam, and also need to consider validators and builders,” said Zhao.

According to Dune analytics, BSC Chain has one of the lowest gas fees among Layer 1 networks. In the past seven days, BSC Chain has accumulated an average gas fee of $0.093 and a median gas fee of $0.034. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s average gas fee stands at $0.34 and its median gas fee is currently at $0.088. Avalanche’s ( AVAX ) average gas fee is reportedly lower than both BSC Chain and Ethereum, as it stands at $0.022. Avalanche’s median gas fee is measured at $0.002. Based on Dune’s data, Solana ( SOL ) and Polygon ( POL ) boast the lowest gas fees compared to other Layer 1s, with Polygon’s average gas fee measured at $0.003 and its median gas fee at $0.001. Solana shares the same median gas fee rate as Polygon, with an average gas fee recorded at $0.019.

Many believe it marks Ethereum’s most user-focused transformation yet. Notably, the official Ethereum X account highlighted this development, writing on May 6 that, “ETH Pectra upgrade drops tomorrow – and it’s a big deal.” The thread highlighted key improvements, including smarter wallets, gas-free options, bigger validator limits, and major enhancements in scaling, usability, and developer tooling. Notably , Pectra combines two upgrades, Prague and Electra, and is being hailed as the biggest Ethereum overhaul since The Merge. However, unlike Merge, which redefined Ethereum’s underlying protocol, Pectra is built with users in mind. “The Merge was for the protocol. Pectra is for the people,” Monolith.vc, an Ethereum community, noted. That said, Pectra is expected to introduce account abstraction , giving wallets far more functionality, including batch transactions, gas payments in any token, and the removal of constant approval pop-ups. Additionally, the validator staking limit will rise from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH, streamlining large-scale staking for ETF issuers and institutional players. Upgrades like Verkle Trees and PeerDAS will improve Ethereum’s performance and scalability. Layer 2s also get a boost, with blob capacity doubling from 3 to 6, lowering congestion and gas fees. As per the Ethereum account, these changes will be technical and practical. “Pectra doesn’t just make Ethereum bigger. It makes it smarter, cheaper, and more mainstream-ready,” the account wrote. Meanwhile, investor sentiment continues to be bullish, reflecting this shift. According to CryptoQuant analyst OroCrypto, Ethereum holders have accumulated over 3.5 million ETH in under two months, a staggering 22.5% rise, highlighting their conviction in the network ahead of the upgrade. “This behavior reflects structural belief in Ethereum’s long-term potential,” Oro noted . Elsewhere, crypto trader Merlijn, founder of Profitz Academy, predicted a surge for ETH to $10,000 in the near future, telling his 386,000 followers not to blink as “this could move fast.” “The ETH launch sequence has started. $1,500 was the liftoff pad. $10,000 is the destination,” he noted . His bullish call is based on technical levels showing $2,200 and $4,000 as key resistance points before Ethereum shoots higher. However, some analysts urge caution. Monolith.vc noted that Pectra doesn’t directly affect ETH supply like the Merge did, so a short-term price spike isn’t guaranteed. However, if institutions move quickly to take advantage of the new staking flexibility, ETH demand could quietly increase in the coming months. At press time, ETH was trading at $1,843, reflecting a 2.74% surge in the past 24 hours.",Ethereum|News|Ethereum News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-07 09:55:05

Here’s why",https://timestabloid.com/expert-urges-xrp-holders-to-prepare-for-10-15-and-30-heres-why/,"Crypto commentator All Things XRP has published a detailed simulation via social media, urging XRP holders to begin thinking seriously about their exit strategy in anticipation of a potential price surge. The message focuses not on speculative price predictions but on the emotional and financial consequences of entering a bull run unprepared. The commentator cautions that if XRP were to climb to figures such as $10, $15, or even $30, many investors could find themselves overwhelmed and directionless. According to the post, the most common consequences of not having a clear plan are either panic selling or missing out on profits altogether. The simulation does not aim to offer financial advice, but to provide a model that helps investors think through their options well in advance of market volatility. The commentator emphasizes that “a moonshot isn’t the time to wing it,” highlighting how heightened emotions and sudden volatility can easily derail rational decision-making. IF XRP STARTS FLYING TOWARD $10, $15… EVEN $30—MOST HOLDERS WILL HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO DO. No plan = missed profits or panic selling. Here’s one example of a staged exit strategy to help you start thinking. pic.twitter.com/vQ7ytMEFPv — All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) May 4, 2025 Outlining a Sample Strategy Based on price points, the simulation breaks down a hypothetical exit plan into four stages. It uses a starting investment of $10,000 at an entry price of $2.20 per XRP, which results in a holding of approximately 4,545 XRP. Each stage reflects a price increase, suggesting a different portion of the total holdings to be sold off in response to the rise. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 At the first stage, when XRP reaches between $3.50 and $4.00, the plan proposes selling 20% of holdings. This is based on the expectation of 60% to 80% returns from the $2.20 entry point and historical resistance around that price. The rationale for this stage is to secure early gains while reducing exposure to downside risk, potentially by converting to stablecoins. The second stage, at $5.00 to $6.00, recommends selling 25% of holdings, aligning with what the commentator identifies as realistic bullish targets for 2025. This stage reflects a gain of 127% to 173%. The suggested action at this level includes reallocating capital to other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, or waiting for more favorable re-entry levels. Stage three—targeting a price between $10.00 and $12.00—focuses on locking in what the commentator describes as significant gains. At this level, 30% of holdings would be sold, translating to a return of 350% to 440%. Due to the expected market volatility at such levels, the plan recommends preserving capital and avoiding greed. The final stage, labeled as speculative, proposes selling the remaining 15% to 20% of XRP holdings if the price exceeds $20. This range is characterized as “moonshot territory.” The suggestion is to convert profits into fiat, physical assets, or long-term holdings. Timing exits at this level is acknowledged to be particularly challenging. Visualizing Potential Outcomes The post concludes by showing what such a staged strategy could look like in dollar terms. If executed according to the simulation, the hypothetical investor would realize approximately $38,500 in profits while still holding 10% of the original XRP, which could be worth an additional $9,000 to $13,000 depending on future price action. Importantly, the commentator reinforces that this is merely one possible model. Other investors might exit entirely by $6, hold most of their position until XRP reaches $30 , or scale out small amounts during every major price surge. The central message is that everyone must define their approach based on personal financial goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

CZ believes Bitcoin could rise to $1 million during the current market cycle, supported by increasing institutional adoption through spot ETFs and sovereign accumulation. Meanwhile, Standard Chartered forecasts that BNB could more than double in value by the end of 2025 and reach $2,775 by 2028, citing its strong correlation with Bitcoin and Ethereum and the continued dominance of Binance’s exchange platform. CZ Predicts Bitcoin Could Reach $1 Million in Current Market Cycle, Citing Institutional and Governmental Adoption Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, co-founder of Binance and one of the most influential voices in the cryptocurrency industry, has made one of his boldest predictions yet: Bitcoin could surge to as high as $1 million during the current market cycle. In a wide-ranging interview with Rug Radio published on May 5, Zhao pointed to a confluence of accelerating trends—including institutional investment through spot Bitcoin ETFs and direct government accumulation—as key drivers of the bullish outlook. “There’s the ETFs. There’s this institutionalization of Bitcoin … it’s a positive in terms of price action, obviously. Our bags are up — not the alt‑coins as much, but at least Bitcoin is,” Zhao said. Zhao’s remarks highlight what many in the crypto community are witnessing firsthand: traditional financial institutions are finally entering the space in a meaningful way. He credited the recent explosion in spot Bitcoin ETFs as a primary reason for the asset’s upward momentum. Indeed, this institutional wave has not gone unnoticed by analysts. Alex Obchakevich, founder of Obchakevich Research, recently said that institutional money now accounts for the lion’s share of Bitcoin’s recent gains. He added that ETFs, particularly those tracking Bitcoin, are acting as a key engine behind the bullish trend, even though they may be accompanied by short-term volatility. Governments Join the Bitcoin Movement Beyond Wall Street, sovereign states are also quietly ramping up their Bitcoin holdings. Zhao emphasized this growing trend, calling it both a validation of Bitcoin’s role in the financial system and a catalyst for its price. His comments come just days after El Salvador—the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender—announced the purchase of an additional 7 BTC, bringing its total to nearly 6,170 BTC, valued at around $580 million. The country has remained resolute in its Bitcoin acquisition strategy despite criticisms from organizations such as the International Monetary Fund. Bhutan, too, is making moves. Reports from January 2025 revealed that the Himalayan kingdom is planning a new economic hub with a strategic reserve of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ether, as part of its long-term financial infrastructure. Zhao also pointed to a surprising new tailwind: the reversal of anti-crypto sentiment at the highest levels of US government. With the election of President Donald Trump, Zhao observed a stark pivot in national policy toward embracing digital assets. A Warning for Retail Investors While his tone was generally optimistic, Zhao offered a sobering observation for latecomers to the Bitcoin party. “Retail had 15 years to buy,” he said. “If they’re late now, that was their choice.” This comment signals a growing sentiment in the crypto space: the era of easy retail accumulation may be drawing to a close as institutional and governmental actors increasingly dominate the market. Zhao’s forecast of $500,000 to $1 million per BTC is not without precedent. Similar predictions have been made by ARK Invest’s Cathie Wood and others, but it’s Zhao’s unique vantage point—both as an industry veteran and the former head of the world’s largest crypto exchange—that gives the statement added weight. His bullish case hinges on continued institutional flows via ETFs, further sovereign accumulation, and favorable political developments—particularly in the United States. While skeptics may balk at such lofty numbers, the convergence of these powerful forces presents a compelling narrative that could reshape the financial landscape in the years ahead. Standard Chartered Predicts BNB Could Surge to $2,775 by 2028, Citing Price Parity With Bitcoin and Ethereum Meanwhile, global banking giant and asset manager Standard Chartered has issued a bullish long-term forecast for BNB, the native cryptocurrency of Binance’s BNB Chain, projecting that the token could more than double in value by the end of 2025 and climb nearly fivefold to $2,775 by 2028. The forecast, included in a newly published analyst report, comes as the digital asset trades around $598 per token, with a fully diluted valuation of approximately $84 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data . Standard Chartered’s analysis suggests a strong upward trajectory for BNB, driven by its price correlation with Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as the continued dominance of Binance as a global exchange player. “BNB has traded almost exactly in line with an unweighted basket of Bitcoin and Ethereum since May 2021 in terms of both returns and volatility,” wrote Geoff Kendrick, head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered. “We expect this relationship to continue to hold, driving BNB’s price from around $600 currently to $2,775 by end-2028.” Price forecasts for BNB (Source: Standard Chartered) In a broader market context, Standard Chartered’s research points to BNB potentially emerging as a benchmark asset within the crypto space. While Bitcoin has long been regarded as the standard-bearer for store-of-value narratives and Ethereum as the innovation engine behind decentralized applications, BNB’s close tracking of both assets may position it as a market “average” in terms of price performance and sentiment. “Given this, we see potential for BNB to serve as a form of benchmark, or average, for digital asset prices more broadly,” Kendrick stated in the report. This benchmark hypothesis hinges largely on the assumption that Binance—the world’s largest centralized exchange by trading volume—continues to maintain its market dominance. As long as Binance retains this stature, the token that underpins its operations is unlikely to experience significant deviation from its current value model. A Conservative but Stable Ecosystem Despite its impressive valuation and performance projections, BNB’s underlying blockchain—BNB Chain—is not known for groundbreaking innovation or developer growth. Compared to developer-rich ecosystems like Ethereum, Solana, or Avalanche, BNB Chain has often been viewed as “old-fashioned,” a term used directly in the report. BNB’s ecosystem is heavy on DEXs (Source: Standard Chartered) Nonetheless, Standard Chartered interprets this conservative composition as a potential stabilizing factor. The report highlighted that more than 60% of BNB Chain’s on-chain activity stems from decentralized exchanges (DEXs), suggesting a reliable and transaction-heavy user base that isn't as susceptible to speculative or fleeting trends like NFTs or meme coins. While this concentration may limit the diversity of applications on BNB Chain, it also reinforces its utility within DeFi, making it an efficient and predictable platform—especially appealing for institutions that prioritize consistency and scalability. Standard Chartered’s optimistic forecast follows a wave of institutional interest in BNB and other crypto assets. Just one day before the report was publicized, asset manager VanEck filed to list the first-ever BNB exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States. If approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the BNB ETF could pave the way for more traditional investors to gain exposure to the token through regulated financial channels. VanEck’s move mirrors a broader trend seen with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, which have funneled billions in capital into the digital asset market and are credited with catalyzing recent rallies in crypto prices. As spot crypto ETFs become increasingly mainstream, BNB’s chances of being viewed as a serious long-term investment asset may further improve, especially if Binance’s presence in the global market remains strong. Looking Ahead: A $1,275 Target by 2025 Standard Chartered’s forecast doesn’t just look to the distant horizon. The firm expects BNB to reach approximately $1,275 by the end of 2025—more than double its current valuation.

Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan expressed concern in a recent blog post that US Congress may squander an opportunity to enshrine key gains in crypto regulation, despite favorable developments led by the current administration. Regulatory Advances Led by the White House While Hougan remains confident in the long-term outlook for digital assets, projecting new all-time highs for several tokens including Bitcoin, he emphasized that political gridlock could pose a short-term risk. “People often ask me what could derail crypto. My answer is simple: people. More specifically, politicians,” Hougan wrote. According to him, legislative inaction could reverse recent positive momentum built through executive orders, regulatory rollbacks, and pro-crypto appointments. The Bitwise executive noted that the Trump administration has been proactive in supporting digital asset development. Examples include the creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve, classifying digital assets as a national priority, and reversing controversial regulatory guidelines such as SAB 121. Moreover, the appointment of crypto-aligned figures like Paul Atkins as SEC Chair and David Sacks as the White House’s “crypto and A.I. czar” has further boosted industry confidence. However, Hougan warned that these executive measures are vulnerable to policy reversals under future administrations unless codified into law. He argued that bipartisan support in Congress is needed to solidify these gains and provide long-term certainty to institutional investors . “We need Congress to pass legislation enshrining crypto’s progress in law,” he wrote, adding that even a single piece of enacted legislation—such as a stablecoin framework—would serve as a signal of political alignment on digital assets. Stalled Stablecoin Bill Sparks Political Uncertainty One focal point of current debate is the GENIUS Act, a stablecoin bill that had appeared to gain traction earlier this year. In March, the Senate Banking Committee voted 18–6 to move the bill forward, with cross-party support from several Democrats. However, that momentum stalled in early May when nine Democratic senators, including some who had supported the bill, withdrew their backing over concerns tied to anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) provisions. Hougan suggested the reversal may reflect shifting political calculations rather than substantive policy disagreements. He also criticized efforts within the crypto industry to merge stablecoin legislation with broader market structure reforms, warning that the strategy risks overcomplicating the process and jeopardizing near-term progress. “This is the perfect becoming the enemy of the good,” Hougan said. Despite the setback, Hougan remains cautiously optimistic that legislation will pass, citing the economic and geopolitical benefits of dollar-denominated stablecoins . “If Washington can get its act together,” he concluded, “I think the bull market will be unstoppable.” Featured image created with DALL-E, Chart on TradingView",Crypto News|Bitwise|Bitwise CIO|Crypto Bill|Crypto Market|SEC|stablecoin bill,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-05-07 10:00:19

This is evidenced by the fact that there are now a large majority of crypto traders who are choosing to bet on a recovery for the meme coin rather than further decline. This is mostly visible on Binance, which is the world’s largest exchange, seeing a sharp drop in short accounts in favor of traders who are long on Dogecoin. 72% Of Binance Traders Are Bullish According to data from Coinglass, there are presently more bulls as regards to the Dogecoin price compared to bears. The Long/Short Ratio on the website helps to map out where crypto traders are leaning and how they are placing their bets. Using percentages, it shows how the vast majority are betting in regards to any coin and exchange, and for Binance, the results have shown more longs than shorts. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Calls Wave 5 To Send XRP Price Above $6 Currently, of all open bets on Dogecoin on the Binance crypto exchange, a whopping 72.46% are long at the time of this writing. This leaves only a smaller percentage of 27.54% of traders who are short. On this account, it shows that bullishness is on the rise for the meme coin. Interestingly, this turn in sentiment seems to be mostly localized to the Binance exchange. Looking at the broader Long/Short Ratio for Dogecoin, there are still more shorts than longs. Total exchanges figures comes out to 51.86% of all open bets in the market currently being short, coming out to over $1.15 billion at the time of this writing. In contrast, only 48.19% of open bets are in favor of longs, coming out to less than $1.1 billion. This gap, despite being quite small, shows that sellers are still dominating the market now. This would explain the decline in the Dogecoin price despite the daily trading volume rising above $700 million. Can The Dogecoin Price Recover? The open interest when it comes to Dogecoin is still quite low as traders are trading more conservatively right now. This has followed the price decline and the fear sentiment that has gripped the market. However, times like these are usually when reversals begin, with many not expecting one. Related Reading: Ethereum Macro Trend Oscillator Shows Green Might Be On The Horizon A crypto analyst has also pointed out that the Dogecoin price is forming a strong Ascending Wedge pattern. Now, if this pattern is completed, it could put the meme coin on the path to a long-lasting rally. The target for this has been placed at $1.161, meaning the analyst is expecting the Dogecoin price to explode by more than 580% from here.

44273555,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157990,1746612056,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Intella X: Neowiz Announces Shocking Blockchain Gaming Platform Discontinuation,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/intella-x-discontinuation/,"The world of crypto gaming is constantly evolving, sometimes bringing unexpected news. Recently, the community received surprising news from South Korean online game giant Neowiz regarding its foray into the blockchain space. What’s Happening with Intella X ? Neowiz’s dedicated blockchain gaming platform , known as Intella X, has officially announced its decision to cease operations. The announcement, made via their official X (formerly Twitter) account, signals a significant shift in the company’s approach to blockchain technology and gaming. This move means that the Intella X platform services and all related offerings will be discontinued. The company cited a shift towards a new business direction as the primary reason for this decision. Which Services Face Platform Discontinuation ? The shutdown is comprehensive, affecting various components that made up the Intella X ecosystem. Users and participants in the platform should be aware of the specific services that are being terminated. These include: The core Intella X platform services itself. The onboarding game A.V.A (Alliance of Valiant Arms), which was integrated into the platform. The Intella X wallet, crucial for managing digital assets within the ecosystem. The NFT marketplace and launchpad, platforms for trading and launching blockchain-based assets. Airdrop services, including specific programs like Adventure, Mission Page, and ERCC: Meow Simulator. Alphastarter, likely a platform related to initial project offerings or access. This extensive list highlights that the discontinuation is not partial but a full winding down of the current Intella X infrastructure. Does This Mean Neowiz is Leaving Blockchain Entirely? While the discontinuation of Intella X is a major development, it’s important to note that this does not necessarily mean Neowiz is completely abandoning its interest in blockchain ventures. According to a report by Yonhap, Neowiz clarified this point, indicating that while the platform is shutting down, the company’s exploration and potential future involvement in the blockchain space are not entirely off the table. This suggests that Neowiz might be exploring alternative strategies, different blockchain technologies, or perhaps focusing on different aspects of the Web3 space that do not involve the current Intella X platform model. The exact nature of this ‘new business direction’ remains to be fully detailed, but the clarification provides a glimmer of hope that Neowiz hasn’t lost faith in the underlying technology, even if its initial implementation faced challenges or no longer aligns with corporate strategy. Challenges and Implications for Crypto Gaming Users The discontinuation of a platform like Intella X presents several challenges, particularly for its users and the broader crypto gaming ecosystem: Loss of Access: Users lose access to the platform, wallet, and associated services. Asset Management: Users need to understand how this affects any digital assets (NFTs, tokens, etc.) they held within the Intella X ecosystem or its associated games. Clear communication from Neowiz on asset migration or withdrawal procedures is crucial. Developer Impact: Game developers planning to onboard or already integrated with Intella X will need to find alternative platforms or adjust their strategies. Market Perception: Platform shutdowns, while sometimes necessary, can impact investor and user confidence in the stability and longevity of specific projects within the blockchain gaming sector. For users, the actionable insight is to stay informed via official Neowiz/Intella X channels regarding shutdown timelines and any procedures for asset recovery or management. It’s a stark reminder of the dynamic and sometimes volatile nature of emerging technology markets. What Could Neowiz’s New Direction Involve? Given that Neowiz stated they aren’t entirely leaving blockchain, their new direction could potentially involve: Focusing on integrating blockchain elements directly into their existing, successful traditional games rather than building a separate platform. Exploring different blockchain networks or Layer 2 solutions that might offer better scalability, lower costs, or different features. Investing in or partnering with other blockchain companies rather than building their own infrastructure from scratch. Developing blockchain tools or services for other developers. Waiting for the market and technology to mature further before launching a new initiative. While speculative, these possibilities highlight that a platform shutdown doesn’t always mean an end to a company’s interest in the underlying technology, but rather a strategic pivot based on lessons learned and market conditions. Conclusion: A Shift for Neowiz in the Blockchain Gaming Platform Space The decision to discontinue the Intella X blockchain gaming platform marks a significant moment for Neowiz and the users who were part of its ecosystem. It underscores the challenges faced by companies navigating the nascent and rapidly changing Web3 landscape. While the Intella X chapter is closing, Neowiz’s clarification suggests they are not exiting the blockchain space entirely, but rather seeking a new path forward. This event serves as a valuable case study on the complexities of building and maintaining dedicated blockchain platforms in the competitive world of crypto gaming .

Blockchain security firm CertiK revealed on May 6 that the hacker transferred 100 Ether, valued at approximately $182,783, through crypto mixing service Tornado Cash. According to CertiK’s investigation, the wallet address used in the transaction was inactive for 166 days, with no movement since November. The address is linked to the original exploit and can be traced to earlier activity involving the hacker. #CertiKInsight 🚨 Our alerting system has detected @TornadoCash deposits of 100 ETH from 0xCF4823dA7271fdedBe103500d8E197Bdca224B6d. The fund traces to ~$4M Voltage Finance exploit on Fuse back in March 2022. Stay Vigilant! pic.twitter.com/eyqH1HbN3F — CertiK Alert (@CertiKAlert) May 6, 2025 The blockchain security firm also explained that the hacker used Tornado Cash, which was sanctioned by the US Treasury in 2022 for facilitating money laundering, to obscure blockchain transactions and prevent investigators from tracing the fund movements. Voltage Finance original 2022 exploit Voltage was hacked on March 31, 2022, and the hacker made away with an estimated $4.67 million in digital tokens. They reportedly took advantage of a vulnerability in a token standard, ERC677, through a built-in callback function. The function allowed them to execute a reentrancy attack to successfully drain funds from the platform’s lending pool. In the initial phase of the attack, the culprit used a flash loan of 515 Wrapped Ether (WETH) from the WETH-WBTC pair on Voltage Finance to initiate the exploit. Voltage Finance operates as a decentralized protocol enabling automated token trading on the Fuse network. The attacker exploited this infrastructure by manipulating the platform’s smart contracts using wrapped tokens and flash loans. Ola Finance, the multi-protocol network that supports Voltage, issued a post-mortem two days after the incident that showed the exploit was specific to its Fuse deployment. The developers stated that similar attacks would not affect other lending networks under Ola’s ecosystem. In total, the attacker siphoned off 216,964.18 USDC, 507,216.68 BUSD, 200,000 fUSD, 550.45 Wrapped Ether (wETH), 26.25 Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC), and 1,240,000 FUSE tokens. “ In later transactions, the attacker avoided a flash loan by using the funds that had already been stolen ,” Ola stated in its report. Another exploit hits in March 2025 Voltage Finance was hit again in a separate exploit on March 18 this year, involving its Simple Staking pools. This time, the unauthorized withdrawal led to the theft of $171,027.20 in USDCE and $151,085.87 in wETH. The platform paused activities on the pool to stop the fund drainage, and said it was “working urgently to identify the hacker.” According to a March 20 Medium report from Voltage Finance, the attack began when a second unknown party, referred to as Attacker 2, withdrew ETH from crypto exchange HTX. Attacker 2 transferred the stolen assets to Attacker 1, who used the money to purchase FUSE tokens via ChangeNow, bridged to the network through LayerZero. From there, the stolen assets were bridged back to Ethereum and moved through several wallets and transactions.The funds were then passed from Attacker 1 to Attacker 3, who received additional funds via SimpleSwap. Attacker 3 deposited some of the tokens into the KuCoin exchange, but swapped and withdrew others back to the first hacker to complete the laundering loop. “ Since your transactions passed through KuCoin, we have initiated cooperation to identify you. We prefer resolving this situation peacefully. We’re offering a bounty of $50K upon the return of all funds, ” Voltage Finance said to the hacker in its X post. According to a recent report by blockchain security firm Immunefi, losses from crypto-related hacks and exploits have reached $1.74 billion so far this year, already surpassing the $1.49 billion total recorded in all of 2024. The 2025 year-to-date total is a nearly fourfold increase from the $420 million reported during the same period in 2024.

This move underscores a growing trend among forward-thinking corporations globally to embrace Bitcoin as a strategic treasury asset. Breaking News: Metaplanet Boosts Bitcoin Holdings Metaplanet recently shared via an official announcement on X that it has acquired an additional 555 BTC. This latest purchase brings the company’s total Metaplanet Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 5,555 BTC. The company, already known for its pro-Bitcoin stance and strategy, continues to solidify its position as a leader in corporate BTC investment within Japan. This specific acquisition of 555 BTC is notable not just for its size, but also for adding to an already significant treasury. The total holding of 5,555 BTC is a substantial amount for a publicly traded company, especially one based in Japan, a nation with unique economic dynamics and regulatory considerations regarding digital assets. Why is Metaplanet’s Bitcoin Investment a Key Moment for Japan? Metaplanet’s consistent and growing Bitcoin investment strategy is particularly impactful within the Japanese market. Japan is a major global economy, but corporate Bitcoin adoption has perhaps lagged behind some Western counterparts until recently. Metaplanet’s actions serve as a prominent example and potential catalyst for other Japanese firms. Here’s why this is significant for Japan Bitcoin adoption: Setting a Precedent: As a publicly listed company, Metaplanet’s transparent embrace of Bitcoin provides a roadmap and builds confidence for other Japanese corporations considering similar moves. Diversification Strategy: It signals a recognition of Bitcoin’s potential as a hedge against yen depreciation and global economic uncertainty, offering a new avenue for treasury management beyond traditional assets. Regulatory Navigation: Metaplanet’s successful integration of Bitcoin into its balance sheet demonstrates that navigating Japan’s regulatory environment for digital assets is achievable for corporations. Raising Awareness: High-profile moves like this bring mainstream attention to Bitcoin and digital assets within Japan, potentially increasing public and corporate interest. Metaplanet is effectively pioneering corporate Bitcoin adoption in a market ripe for digital asset innovation. How Does Metaplanet Approach Its BTC Investment Strategy? Metaplanet has been quite vocal about its rationale for accumulating Bitcoin. Their strategy aligns with the view that Bitcoin serves as a robust store of value and a hedge against inflation and currency debasement. This perspective is shared by a growing number of institutions and corporations globally. Their approach involves: Viewing BTC as a Long-Term Reserve Asset: Not a short-term trade, but a fundamental component of their treasury strategy intended to preserve capital over time. Mitigating Fiat Currency Risks: Using Bitcoin to counter the potential loss of purchasing power associated with holding large reserves in traditional fiat currencies like the Japanese Yen. Strategic Capital Allocation: Periodically allocating available capital to Bitcoin purchases, demonstrating a commitment to increasing their exposure over time. This consistent accumulation strategy, as seen with the recent 555 BTC addition, highlights their conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. Is Institutional Bitcoin Adoption Growing Globally? Metaplanet is part of a larger, accelerating trend of institutional Bitcoin adoption. While MicroStrategy remains the largest corporate holder by a significant margin, an increasing number of companies are adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. This includes not just corporations, but also asset managers via instruments like Bitcoin ETFs, and even some sovereign wealth funds are rumored to be exploring the space. Comparing Metaplanet to other key players provides context: Company Headquarters Total BTC Holdings (Approx.) Primary Strategy MicroStrategy USA ~214,400 BTC Primary treasury reserve asset Metaplanet Japan 5,555 BTC Treasury reserve asset, inflation hedge Tesla USA ~9,720 BTC Corporate treasury (partial) Note: Holdings figures are approximate and subject to change based on company announcements. This table illustrates that while Metaplanet’s holdings are smaller than giants like MicroStrategy, they are substantial and place the company among notable corporate Bitcoin holders globally. The key takeaway is the diversification of this trend geographically and across different industries. What are the Benefits and Potential Challenges of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings? Adopting a BTC investment strategy comes with potential rewards and risks. Companies like Metaplanet weigh these carefully. Potential Benefits: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin’s fixed supply is seen by many as protection against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Potential Appreciation: If Bitcoin’s value continues to grow, the corporate treasury’s value increases. Diversification: Provides an asset uncorrelated (or less correlated) with traditional financial markets. Attracting Talent/Investors: Signals a forward-thinking, technologically savvy approach that can appeal to certain employees and investors. Increased Visibility: Corporate holdings often generate significant media attention. Potential Challenges: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can be highly volatile, potentially impacting the reported value of treasury holdings. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving in many jurisdictions, including Japan. Accounting Treatment: Accounting rules for digital assets can be complex and may require frequent impairment testing if the price drops. Security Risks: Holding significant amounts of Bitcoin requires robust security measures to prevent theft or loss. Public Perception: Some traditional investors or stakeholders may be skeptical of cryptocurrency investments. Metaplanet’s continued purchases suggest they believe the long-term benefits outweigh the risks associated with holding Bitcoin . What Can Investors Learn from Metaplanet’s Strategic Move? Metaplanet’s actions offer several insights for individual and institutional investors watching the space: Long-Term Conviction: Corporate treasury strategies like Metaplanet’s are typically long-term. This reinforces the idea that Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a generational asset. Importance of Research: Understanding the rationale behind a company’s Bitcoin investment helps assess its overall financial strategy and risk tolerance. Diversification Potential: The corporate world is increasingly seeing the value of including non-traditional assets like Bitcoin in a diversified portfolio. Monitoring Corporate Adoption: Tracking which companies are adding Bitcoin can provide signals about growing mainstream acceptance and potential future demand. Metaplanet’s strategic move is a case study in how companies are adapting their financial strategies in response to global economic changes and the rise of digital assets. What’s Next for Japan and Institutional Bitcoin Adoption? Metaplanet’s continued leadership in Japan Bitcoin adoption raises questions about what the future holds. Will other major Japanese corporations follow suit? Increased corporate interest could potentially lead to: More tailored financial products and services for corporate crypto holdings in Japan. Potential adjustments or clarifications in accounting and tax regulations for digital assets held by companies. Increased trading volume and liquidity in the Japanese crypto market. A broader acceptance of Bitcoin and other digital assets within Japan’s financial ecosystem. Metaplanet’s 5,555 BTC holding is not just a number; it’s a symbol of a potential shift in corporate financial strategy within a major Asian economy, pushing the boundaries of institutional Bitcoin adoption . Conclusion: A Bold Step in the World of Corporate Bitcoin Metaplanet’s latest acquisition of 555 BTC, bringing their total to 5,555 BTC, is a significant event for both the company and the broader cryptocurrency market, particularly in Asia. It reinforces the narrative of increasing institutional Bitcoin adoption and positions Metaplanet as a pioneer in integrating Bitcoin into corporate treasury strategy within Japan. This move highlights the growing confidence among forward-thinking companies in Bitcoin’s role as a long-term store of value and a hedge against economic instability. As more companies globally, and specifically in key markets like Japan, make similar BTC investment decisions, the foundation for Bitcoin’s place in the global financial system continues to strengthen. Metaplanet’s strategic commitment is a clear signal that corporate Bitcoin adoption is not just a trend, but a potentially enduring shift.
