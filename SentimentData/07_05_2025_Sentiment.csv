44253544,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157759,1746573607,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Accusation: Trump Crypto Ventures Labeled ‘Open Corruption’ by US Congressman,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-crypto-open-corruption/,"The world of cryptocurrency is no stranger to controversy, but when it intersects directly with high-profile political figures, the temperature rises dramatically. Recent comments from a U.S. Congressman regarding Trump crypto ventures have ignited a fiery debate, bringing accusations of misconduct and conflicts of interest squarely into the digital asset space. This isn’t just about technology; it’s about ethics, transparency, and the potential entanglement of personal financial interests with public service. Why Are Trump’s Crypto Ventures Raising Concerns? The spotlight has recently intensified on the various digital asset activities linked to former President Donald Trump and his family. These ventures include the launch of non-fungible token (NFT) collections and, more recently, speculation surrounding a meme coin allegedly tied to the Trump brand or family, often referred to as the Donald Trump meme coin (DJT). While some see these as savvy business moves or innovative ways to engage supporters, others, like U.S. Representative Gerry Connolly, view them through a much more critical lens. In a candid interview with DL News, Representative Gerry Connolly , a Democrat from Virginia, did not mince words. He described the involvement of Trump and his family in these cryptocurrency endeavors as amounting to nothing less than “open corruption.” This is a significant accusation, suggesting a blatant disregard for ethical boundaries rather than mere potential conflicts. Connolly’s concerns stem from a broader view of Trump’s political career, particularly referencing the initial period of his presidency. He stated that the first 100 days of the Trump administration were “rife with conflicts of interest.” This historical context is crucial because it frames the current crypto activities not as isolated incidents but as part of a pattern where personal financial interests are perceived to potentially influence or benefit from public position or political power. What Constitutes ‘Open Corruption’ in This Context? When a figure like Gerry Connolly uses a term as strong as “open corruption,” it implies more than just a conflict of interest; it suggests a situation where private gain is openly prioritized or pursued through means enabled by political influence or status. In the context of Trump crypto activities, the accusation likely revolves around several key points: Leveraging Political Status: Using the former President’s name, brand, and political following to promote and potentially profit from digital assets like NFTs and meme coins. The value of such assets is often heavily reliant on hype, speculation, and the perceived endorsement of the associated figure. Lack of Transparency: Questions surrounding the ownership, control, and financial beneficiaries of these crypto ventures. Who truly profits? Is it Donald Trump directly, his family members, or associated entities? The opaque nature of some crypto projects can exacerbate these concerns. Potential for Market Manipulation: The significant influence a figure like Trump holds means any comments or actions related to a specific coin or NFT project could drastically impact its value, potentially benefiting insiders or creators at the expense of retail investors. Preferential Treatment Allegations: Connolly also cited “preferential treatment given to figures in the digital asset industry.” This suggests concerns that the Trump administration, or a future one, might favor specific individuals or companies within the crypto space, potentially those connected to or supportive of Trump’s ventures, leading to unfair advantages or policy decisions. These points collectively paint a picture where the lines between political activity, personal branding, and financial gain in the unregulated or lightly regulated crypto market become dangerously blurred. The accusation of “open corruption” highlights the perceived lack of effort to conceal these potential conflicts. Exploring the Donald Trump Meme Coin Phenomenon The emergence and subsequent volatility surrounding the Donald Trump meme coin , often symbolized by the ticker DJT, perfectly encapsulate the controversial intersection of politics and speculative digital assets. Meme coins are cryptocurrencies inspired by internet memes or popular culture, often lacking underlying fundamental value and driven primarily by community hype and social media trends. The DJT coin specifically gained traction amid rumors of a direct endorsement or launch by Donald Trump or his son, Barron Trump. While the origins and official connection remain debated and somewhat murky, the coin’s value has been heavily influenced by speculation tied to the Trump name. This situation raises profound questions about: Investor Protection: Meme coins are notoriously volatile and risky. If a political figure promotes or is perceived to be associated with such an asset, it could draw in unsuspecting retail investors who might be swayed by the political connection rather than understanding the inherent financial risks. Political Ethics: Should political figures, especially those who have held or seek public office, be involved in promoting highly speculative assets where their influence can directly impact market value? Regulatory Challenges: How do existing financial regulations or potential future crypto regulation apply to assets tied to political figures? The current regulatory landscape is still evolving, making these situations particularly complex to address. The DJT meme coin saga serves as a live example of the challenges Gerry Connolly and others are pointing to when discussing conflicts of interest and potential corruption in the digital asset space. The Broader Implications for Crypto Regulation The controversy surrounding Trump crypto activities is not just about one individual; it has significant implications for the ongoing debate around crypto regulation in the United States. As more political figures engage with or launch their own digital assets, the pressure on lawmakers and regulatory bodies like the SEC and CFTC to establish clear rules increases. Here are some potential implications: Increased Scrutiny: Political involvement in crypto will likely lead to greater scrutiny from regulators, ethics watchdogs, and the public. This could accelerate calls for stricter rules on transparency, disclosure, and potential conflicts of interest for public officials dealing with digital assets. Defining Digital Assets: The nature of assets like NFTs and meme coins challenges existing definitions. Are they securities? Commodities? Collectibles? The regulatory response will depend heavily on these classifications. Political Polarization of Crypto: As crypto becomes intertwined with political figures, it risks becoming another politically polarized issue, potentially hindering bipartisan efforts to create sensible regulation. Focus on Market Integrity: Allegations of preferential treatment or potential market manipulation related to political figures’ crypto ventures highlight the need for regulations that protect market integrity and prevent abuse of influence. Gerry Connolly’s strong words reflect a growing concern among some policymakers about the potential for the digital asset space to be exploited for personal gain by those in positions of power. This concern could directly influence the direction and speed of future crypto regulation efforts. Navigating the Intersection of Politics and Digital Assets The entanglement of politics and digital assets presents a complex landscape for everyone involved – politicians, regulators, investors, and the crypto industry itself. While proponents argue that political engagement can bring mainstream attention and potentially favorable policies to the crypto space, critics warn of the inherent risks when personal financial interests collide with public duty. Key challenges and considerations include: Challenge Description Transparency & Disclosure Lack of clear rules on when and how politicians must disclose crypto holdings or affiliations. Conflict of Interest Situations where a politician’s personal crypto investments could influence their policy decisions or public statements. Market Integrity Risk of market manipulation or unfair advantage due to a politician’s influence or access to information. Public Trust Erosion of public trust if political figures are seen as using their position to profit from speculative assets. The accusations leveled by Gerry Connolly underscore the urgent need for clarity and ethical guidelines governing the interaction between politics and the burgeoning world of digital assets. Whether it’s the specifics of the Donald Trump meme coin or broader involvement in the sector, the political implications are significant. Conclusion: A Critical Juncture for Political Ethics and Crypto Representative Gerry Connolly’s blunt assessment that Trump crypto ventures constitute “open corruption” highlights a critical and increasingly visible challenge: the ethical boundaries for political figures engaging with speculative digital assets. The controversy surrounding activities like the Donald Trump meme coin brings to the forefront concerns about conflicts of interest, transparency, market integrity, and the potential for political status to be leveraged for personal financial gain. As the crypto market continues to evolve and gain mainstream attention, the interaction between digital assets and politics will remain a focal point. The strong reactions from figures like Gerry Connolly signal that policymakers are watching and that calls for clear rules and ethical standards for politicians involved in crypto are likely to grow louder. How this tension between political engagement and the need for ethical conduct and robust crypto regulation is resolved will significantly shape both the future of digital assets and public trust in government.

SHIB bulls and bears are battling with almost equal strength. A 29 trillion SHIB trap could determine Shiba Inu’s next direction. Shiba Inu (SHIB), Ethereum’s well-known meme coin, has entered a critical trading zone. With prices hovering around the $0.000012 mark, both bullish and bearish traders are closely watching for its next significant move. This level puts SHIB at a point where neither side has clear control, meaning the next price swing could heavily influence the token’s path in the coming weeks or months. $0.000012: A Key Technical Level for SHIB From a technical perspective, the $0.000012 level is a notable support for SHIB, considering how often the price has tested it. The level’s importance also means it could quickly turn into a strong resistance point if the price decisively breaks and stays below it. Because of this, market analysts are looking closely at other indicators to understand SHIB’s current price action.

Per the South Korean newspaper Hanguk Kyungjae , Lee made a series of pledges to younger voters while speaking at an event in North Chungcheong Province on May 6. The candidate said: “I will create a safer environment for investment. That will help young people build up their assets and plan for the future.” South Korean Presidential Frontrunner: I Will Legalize BTC ETFs Lee said his government would institutionalize crypto spot ETFs. He also said that he would build an integrated monitoring system to police the crypto sector.

He said that he would “bring about a reduction in crypto transaction fees.” It is unclear at this stage exactly how Lee would seek to fulfil this promise. In South Korea, crypto exchanges are currently free to set transaction fees as they see fit. However, Lee’s government, should he win on June 3, could theoretically seek to impose a cap on exchange transaction fees. In recent months, exchanges like Bithumb have sought to boost trading volumes by offering their clients commission-free trading for limited periods. These promotions have proved enormously popular among South Korean traders, with Lee’s camp possibly taking note. Candidates Courting Younger Voters? Money Today reported that analysts think Lee is trying to win over younger voters by making manifesto pledges about “issues that are very important to young people.” Lee has been relatively quiet on crypto-related policy matters in the lead up to June’s poll. May 6’s comments are the first time he has spoken about his crypto stance on the campaign trail. Lee Jae-myung, candidate for the South Korean presidency, speaking at an event in a market in North Chungcheong Province on May 6. (Source: Chuncheon MBC News/Screenshot) It is likely that his comments are a response to recent crypto pledges from Lee’s main rival in the polls, the ruling People Power Party (PPP)’s candidate Kim Moon-soon. Earlier this month, Kim pledged to let South Korea’s state pension fund and the sovereign wealth fund make direct crypto investments . The PPP has also rolled out seven crypto-related manifesto pledges ahead of June 3 . The party says it plans to do away with restrictive banking rules for crypto exchanges. How Sincere Are Crypto Manifesto Pledges? Skeptics will likely cast a cautious eye on the two candidates’ comments. Hanguk Kyungjae noted that Lee’s Democratic Party pledged to green-light crypto spot ETFs ahead of last year’s legislative elections. The newspaper wrote: “Although the party won a landslide victory in the election, there has been no significant progress made on the matter since then.” Lee promised to build a “society that gives opportunities to young people.” He added: “A society that neglects young people will only regress.” DPK intensifies impeachment threats against Supreme Court justices https://t.co/eG9i8HvCqO — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) May 6, 2025 Recent opinion polls put Lee around 20 percentage points ahead of Kim, with almost 50% of popular support. The election was sparked by the recent impeachment of President Yoon Suk-yeol, who unsuccessfully attempted to declare martial law in December 2024.

His startup, NewLimit , focused on developing treatments to reverse the effects of aging, has just announced a substantial funding round, signaling strong investor confidence in its ambitious goal of extending healthy human lifespan. What is NewLimit and Why the Buzz? Founded over four years ago by Brian Armstrong, former GV partner Blake Bryers, and stem cell professor Jacob Kimmel, NewLimit is not your typical crypto venture. Instead, it operates at the frontier of genetic reprogramming, aiming to revitalize aged cells and restore their youthful functions. The company believes it can increase how long people live a healthy life by manipulating cellular genetics. The recent buzz surrounds their impressive Series B funding round, which successfully raised $130 million. This follows a $40 million Series A two years prior, demonstrating accelerated progress and growing investor interest. The round was led by prominent venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins, with participation from notable investors like Nat Friedman, Daniel Gross, Khosla Ventures, Founders Fund, Dimension Capital, Elad Gil, and Patrick Collison. Progress Towards Age Reversal NewLimit claims to have made considerable strides in its research. Blake Bryers shared insights into their progress, revealing the discovery of three prototype medicines specifically designed to reprogram liver cells. Lab experiments reportedly show that this rejuvenation process can restore the cells’ ability to process fat and alcohol, mirroring the function of younger cells. How do they measure this? Bryers explained they compare how cells from younger and older individuals respond to substances. An older liver cell treated with NewLimit’s epigenetic reprogramming techniques begins to behave more like a younger cell. Leveraging AI in Biotech A key component of NewLimit’s strategy is the integration of artificial intelligence into their drug discovery process. While human trials are still several years away, the company is actively developing new anti-aging medicines using an AI model. This AI model allows NewLimit to simulate numerous experiments computationally, drastically narrowing down the potential candidates. Only the most promising machine-generated drugs are then moved to laboratory testing. Data gathered from these lab experiments is fed back into the AI model, refining its capabilities in a process dubbed a ‘lab in a loop’. This approach significantly accelerates the identification of potential treatments for age reversal . The Road Ahead and the Competitive Landscape Despite the promising early results, NewLimit acknowledges that the path to human trials is still long, estimated to be a few years away. The current focus remains on leveraging AI and lab research to identify and develop more effective treatments. NewLimit operates in an increasingly competitive field. Other well-funded startups are also tackling the challenge of extending lifespan through biotech . Notably, Retro Biosciences, backed by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, raised $180 million and is reportedly seeking a $1 billion Series A. Altos Labs, which launched with an impressive $3 billion in 2022, also counts prominent figures like Jeff Bezos among its backers. This highlights the significant capital and talent flowing into the longevity space. Why is Brian Armstrong Investing in Age Reversal? For readers primarily interested in crypto, Brian Armstrong ‘s involvement in NewLimit might seem like a departure. However, it reflects a trend among tech billionaires to invest wealth and resources into ambitious, long-term projects addressing fundamental human challenges, such as health and longevity. It demonstrates a diversification of interests beyond the core crypto business, focusing on potentially transformative scientific breakthroughs that could have profound impacts on society. Conclusion: A Glimpse into the Future NewLimit’s successful $130 million funding round is a significant milestone in the pursuit of age reversal . Backed by prominent investors and led by figures like Brian Armstrong , the company is pushing the boundaries of biotech and AI to develop treatments that could fundamentally alter the human experience by extending healthy life. While the journey is still in its early stages, the progress reported by NewLimit offers a compelling glimpse into a future where cellular rejuvenation and enhanced longevity might become realities.

44254254,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157761,1746574802,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Solana Name Service Gets Powerful New SNS Token from Bonfida,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/solana-name-service-sns-token/,"The world of decentralized identity and human-readable addresses on the blockchain is constantly evolving. If you’re involved in the Solana ecosystem, you’ve likely encountered the Solana Name Service , which allows users to replace complex wallet addresses with simple, memorable .sol domain names. Now, a significant development is unfolding within this vital infrastructure, spearheaded by the team at Bonfida. Understanding the Solana Name Service Before diving into the new token, let’s quickly recap what the Solana Name Service (SNS) is all about. Think of it as the DNS (Domain Name System) for the Solana blockchain. Instead of sharing a long string of characters for your wallet address, you can register a .sol domain, like ‘yourname.sol’. This makes sending and receiving transactions much easier and more user-friendly. The SNS ecosystem has grown steadily, facilitating easier interaction with decentralized applications (dApps) and wallets across Solana. It’s a crucial piece of the puzzle for mass adoption, making crypto feel less intimidating for everyday users. Why a Dedicated SNS Token ? The Shift from FIDA For a while, the Solana Name Service was closely associated with Bonfida’s native token, FIDA. Bonfida, a decentralized exchange built on Solana, was instrumental in developing and launching SNS. However, as the SNS ecosystem matured, the team identified a need for a dedicated token that could more directly serve the community and governance needs of .sol domain holders. According to Bonfida’s announcement, the FIDA token, while valuable for the broader Bonfida platform and its DEX features, didn’t fully align with the specific requirements and future vision for SNS governance and community incentives. This led to the strategic decision to introduce a new, purpose-built token: SNS. The introduction of the SNS token marks a pivot towards empowering the community directly involved with the naming service itself. It’s designed to be the primary driver for governance and participation within the SNS ecosystem going forward. FIDA vs. SNS: A Quick Look To clarify the distinction and the shift in focus, here’s a simple comparison: Feature FIDA (Previous Role in SNS) SNS (New Role for SNS Ecosystem) Primary Utility Bonfida DEX features, Staking, some SNS integration Governance for SNS, Ecosystem incentives, Future SNS-specific utility Governance Focus Broader Bonfida platform decisions Specific proposals and direction for the Solana Name Service Community Alignment Bonfida users .sol domain holders and SNS participants Future Development Remains core to Bonfida platform Foundation for future Solana Name Service features and growth While FIDA will retain limited utility within the Bonfida ecosystem, the SNS token is positioned as the cornerstone for the future development and community engagement of the Solana Name Service. Benefits for .sol Domains Holders So, what does this mean if you own one or more .sol domains ? The introduction of the SNS token is primarily aimed at benefiting the very users who make up the Solana Name Service community – the .sol domain holders. The core benefit revolves around governance. Holding SNS tokens is expected to grant holders voting rights on proposals related to the future of the Solana Name Service. This could include decisions on: Feature development for SNS Changes to domain registration or renewal processes Allocation of ecosystem funds Integrations with other Solana protocols This shift empowers the community, giving them a direct voice in shaping the service they use and rely on. It aligns the incentives, ensuring that those invested in the success and utility of their .sol domains also have a stake in the governance and evolution of the underlying service. Beyond governance, the SNS token may also introduce new ways for holders to participate in and benefit from the ecosystem, potentially through staking mechanisms or other incentive programs designed to encourage active participation and network health. Exploring Bonfida ‘s Role and Vision Bonfida’s decision to launch the SNS token demonstrates their continued commitment to the Solana ecosystem, particularly the infrastructure layer provided by the Solana Name Service. As the initial developer of SNS, Bonfida is facilitating this transition to a more community-governed model for the naming service. This move aligns with the broader trend in decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 towards greater decentralization and community ownership. By separating the governance of SNS from the core Bonfida DEX token (FIDA), Bonfida is enabling the SNS community to forge its own path and priorities, fostering a more focused and engaged user base for the naming service itself. Bonfida will likely play a crucial role in the initial distribution and technical implementation of the SNS token and the new governance framework, guiding the ecosystem through this significant transition. The Growing Landscape of Crypto Domain Names The introduction of the SNS token also highlights the increasing importance of Crypto Domain Names in the digital asset space. Services like Solana Name Service (.sol), Ethereum Name Service (ENS, .eth), Unstoppable Domains (.crypto, .nft, etc.), and others are building the foundational layer for a more human-friendly decentralized web. These naming services are not just about simplifying addresses; they are becoming digital identities, linking profiles, avatars, and other data to a single, easy-to-remember name. The move by Bonfida to give the SNS community its own governance token underscores the value and distinct identity that these naming ecosystems are developing. As the space of Crypto Domain Names matures, we can expect increased competition, innovation, and potentially more specialized governance models like the one being implemented for the Solana Name Service. How to Engage with the SNS Ecosystem For existing .sol domain holders or those interested in acquiring one and participating in the ecosystem, here are some actionable steps and considerations: Stay Informed: Follow Bonfida and Solana Name Service official channels for announcements regarding the SNS token distribution, claiming process (if any for .sol holders), and governance portal launch. Understand Governance: Learn how the proposed governance model for the SNS token will work. Your SNS tokens will give you a voice in future decisions. Acquiring .sol Domains: If you don’t have one yet, you can register .sol domains through platforms integrated with the Solana Name Service. Owning a domain is key to being part of the core community. Explore Utility: Look for dApps and wallets on Solana that integrate with SNS, using your .sol domain for transactions or identity. Potential Challenges Ahead While the launch of the SNS token is a positive step towards decentralization and community empowerment, challenges may arise. These could include: Ensuring fair and wide distribution of the SNS token. Engaging the community effectively in governance participation. Maintaining the security and stability of the SNS infrastructure during and after the transition. Navigating potential complexities in the relationship between the SNS ecosystem and the broader Bonfida platform. Successfully addressing these challenges will be crucial for the long-term health and growth of the Solana Name Service under its new token-governed structure. Conclusion Bonfida’s introduction of a dedicated SNS token for the Solana Name Service marks an exciting evolution. By shifting governance power and incentives specifically to the community of .sol domain holders, the team is fostering a more focused, engaged, and decentralized ecosystem for human-readable addresses on Solana. This move not only strengthens the Solana Name Service itself but also highlights the growing significance and distinct value of Crypto Domain Names within the broader Web3 landscape. It’s a clear signal that the future of digital identity on Solana will be increasingly shaped by the hands of its users.

The program, revealed Tuesday, allows individual and corporate users to borrow cash using Bitcoin as collateral without selling the asset. Mallers wrote on X that people shouldn’t have to sell the best-performing asset to access cash. The entrepreneur, who recently took the helm at Twenty-One Capital, a rival to Tether-backed Strategy, emphasized that the offering allows users to unlock the value of their Bitcoin holdings without liquidating them. Strike targets wealthy clients with high-value, credit-free Bitcoin loans The new Strike Lending product will first launch in specific U.S. markets and be followed by an international expansion. The offering is tailored for high-net-worth individuals and institutional clients. It provides 12-month loans from $75,000 to $2 million at a minimum 12% APR interest rate with the option to pay monthly or to pay back the full interest and loan balance at the end of the 12-month term. It is also worth mentioning that Strike will offer no origination or early repayment fees. These Bitcoin-backed loans will not go on credit reports and have no bearing on credit scores. To provide competitive terms, Strike works with third-party capital providers that have been vetted and who retain the collateral during the loan term. However, Strike remains legally responsible for the collateral the whole time. Strike’s launch comes amid a broader resurgence in crypto credit markets, which are recovering from the dramatic 2022 downturn that saw major players like BlockFi, Celsius, and Genesis collapse. While the sector remains below its 2021 peak—down 43% from the $64.4 billion high, according to Galaxy Research —lenders such as Coinbase and Xapo have recently expanded their offerings. As of Q4 2024, centralized finance (CeFi) leaders Tether, Galaxy, and Ledn collectively hold loan books worth $9.9 billion, comprising nearly 89% of the CeFi market and 27% of the broader crypto lending ecosystem, which includes crypto-collateralized CDP stablecoins. Bitcoin loans redefine financial products as Strike expands into crypto lending Bitcoin loans represent a shift toward expanding how the world’s largest digital asset can be used as a financial product. By offering liquidity without exchanging ownership of the coin, borrowers gain liquidity and maintain their exposure to Bitcoin. Strike is positioning itself as a modern alternative for accessing liquidity during what appears to be a bullish phase for Bitcoin and digital assets. As Mallers pointed out, “If #bitcoin continues to grow faster than your borrowing costs, your asset appreciates faster than your debt.” The growing demand for on-chain lending is also evident in Ethereum, where the decentralized lending sector now exceeds $34 billion. This launch also coincides with Mallers’ recent appointment as CEO of Twenty-One Capital , a Bitcoin-focused financial firm backed by Cantor Fitzgerald. With Mallers now leading both Strike and Twenty-One Capital, questions about potential synergies between Strike’s lending service and a larger Bitcoin financing strategy are emerging.

44254537,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157762,1746575458,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,US CBDC Rejection: Treasury Secretary Calls Digital Dollar Plan a Sign of Weakness,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-cbdc-treasury-rejection/,"Big news dropped recently concerning the potential future of money in the United States. The conversation around a US CBDC , or Central Bank Digital Currency, has been ongoing, but a recent statement from a high-ranking official has certainly stirred the pot. According to reports, the US Treasury Secretary has expressed a clear lack of support for the idea of the Federal Reserve issuing its own digital currency. What Did the US Treasury Secretary Say About the Digital Dollar? The core of the recent report, initially shared by Watcher Guru on X, is the stance attributed to the US Treasury Secretary . The Secretary reportedly stated a lack of support for the Federal Reserve moving forward with a central bank digital currency . Even more pointedly, the concept was described as a “sign of weakness.” This isn’t just a casual comment; it’s a significant signal from a key figure in the nation’s financial leadership. This statement adds a notable voice to the ongoing debate surrounding the creation of a digital dollar . While the Federal Reserve has been researching and discussing the possibility, indicating no immediate plans but exploring the technology and implications, this Treasury perspective introduces a strong note of caution, if not outright opposition, from the executive branch’s financial arm. Why is a Federal Reserve Digital Currency Being Discussed? The idea of a Federal Reserve digital currency stems from several factors driving central banks worldwide to consider their own digital money. These include: The rise of private digital currencies: Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and stablecoins have highlighted public interest in digital forms of money, prompting central banks to consider offering a state-backed alternative. Improving payment systems: Proponents argue a CBDC could potentially offer faster, cheaper, and more efficient payment systems compared to existing infrastructure. Financial inclusion: A digital dollar could theoretically provide easier access to financial services for unbanked or underbanked populations. Maintaining monetary sovereignty: In an increasingly digital and globalized financial landscape, some argue a CBDC is necessary for a central bank to effectively implement monetary policy and maintain control over its currency’s ecosystem. International competitiveness: As other nations explore or launch their own CBDCs, there’s a concern the US could fall behind in financial innovation without its own US CBDC . Despite these potential motivations, the path to creating a digital dollar in the U.S. is complex and faces numerous hurdles. Is a US CBDC a Sign of Weakness, and Why? The Treasury Secretary’s characterization of a Federal Reserve digital currency as a “sign of weakness” is particularly noteworthy and warrants deeper examination. While the specific reasoning behind this phrasing wasn’t detailed in the initial report, we can infer potential arguments that align with such a view: Undermining the Existing System: Critics argue that introducing a CBDC could disrupt the existing two-tiered banking system, potentially drawing deposits away from commercial banks and concentrating financial power with the central bank. This could be seen as a sign of weakness in the private banking sector or an overreach by the government. Privacy Concerns: A government-issued digital currency raises significant privacy concerns. Opponents fear it could enable unprecedented government surveillance of citizens’ financial transactions, which some might view as a characteristic of less free or weaker societies where individual privacy is compromised. Competition with Private Innovation: The U.S. has a strong history of private sector innovation in payments and finance. Some argue that a government-backed digital dollar could stifle this innovation or unfairly compete with private stablecoins and payment solutions, implying a lack of confidence in the market’s ability to evolve on its own. Security Risks: Centralizing a nation’s currency infrastructure into a single digital system could create a massive, attractive target for cyberattacks, potentially exposing the country to significant financial instability – arguably a sign of systemic vulnerability or weakness. Necessity and Justification: Some argue that the U.S. already has efficient digital payment systems (like credit cards, apps, etc.) and that the stated benefits of a CBDC do not outweigh the significant costs and risks. Pursuing a CBDC without a clear, compelling need could be seen as an unnecessary and potentially destabilizing endeavor, perhaps indicative of a weak rationale. These points highlight that the “sign of weakness” comment likely reflects concerns about potential negative impacts on the existing financial structure, individual liberties, market dynamics, or national security, rather than weakness in the technology itself. Comparing the Digital Dollar Debate: Pros vs. Cons The debate around a central bank digital currency in the U.S. is multifaceted, involving a wide range of potential benefits and significant challenges. Here’s a simplified comparison: Potential Benefits (Arguments For) Potential Challenges (Arguments Against) Faster & Cheaper Payments Privacy Concerns & Surveillance Risk Increased Financial Inclusion Cybersecurity & Systemic Risk Enhanced Monetary Policy Tools Disruption to Commercial Banking International Competitiveness Implementation Costs & Complexity Potential for Innovation Stifling Private Sector Innovation The statement from the US Treasury Secretary clearly aligns more with the “Challenges” column, emphasizing potential downsides over perceived benefits. What Does This Mean for the Future of a US CBDC? The opinion of the US Treasury Secretary carries significant weight within the executive branch and influences policy discussions. While the Federal Reserve operates independently, its decisions on something as monumental as issuing a Federal Reserve digital currency would undoubtedly involve extensive consultation and consideration of views from across the government, including the Treasury. This public stance suggests a high-level resistance within the current administration towards the concept of a digital dollar . It doesn’t necessarily kill the idea entirely, as research and debate will likely continue, but it certainly places a significant political hurdle in its path. It signals that any proposal for a US CBDC would face strong opposition from at least one key financial leader. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and those following the evolution of digital finance, this development is crucial. It underscores the complex political and economic considerations at play beyond just the technological feasibility of a central bank digital currency . It also highlights that the U.S. approach to digital money may continue to favor private sector innovation (like stablecoins) over a direct government-issued alternative, at least for now. Actionable Insights: What Should You Watch For? Given this development, here are a few things to keep an eye on: Further Statements: Will other government officials or Federal Reserve governors echo or counter this sentiment? Legislative Action: Will Congress take steps to either prohibit or authorize the exploration/creation of a digital dollar ? Several bills related to this topic have already been introduced. Federal Reserve Research: How will the Fed’s ongoing research and publications reflect or respond to this high-level feedback? Global Developments: Will progress or issues with CBDCs in other countries influence the U.S. debate? Private Sector Innovation: Will the focus shift further towards regulating and integrating private stablecoins as the primary form of digital dollar in the U.S.? The landscape for a US CBDC remains uncertain, but this recent statement provides a strong indication of the challenges it faces at the highest levels of government. Compelling Summary: The Digital Dollar Debate Takes a Negative Turn In summary, the reported statement from the US Treasury Secretary , rejecting the notion of a Federal Reserve digital currency and labeling it a “sign of weakness,” marks a significant moment in the ongoing debate. It introduces a powerful voice of opposition from within the executive branch, adding complexity to the Federal Reserve’s exploration of a central bank digital currency . While the potential benefits of a digital dollar are discussed, concerns surrounding privacy, financial stability, and market impact appear to be weighing heavily on some key decision-makers. This development suggests that the path towards a US CBDC is likely to be challenging and highlights the deep divisions that exist regarding the role of government in the future of digital money.

Despite ongoing market fluctuations, the cryptocurrency continues to hold key levels, maintaining a bullish path toward the $5 target. Elliott Wave Maps Out XRP Price Path To $5 XForceGlobal, a Certified Elliott Wave analyst, recently shared a medium-timeframe Elliott Wave analysis of XRP, focusing on its price action and wave structure. According to the analyst, XRP remains on a bullish path, indicating a strong potential for upward movement toward the $5.4 target. Related Reading: XRP Price Breaks Above ‘Magic Line’ With Bullish Continuation Toward $3 The price chart shows that XRP is in the final stages of a complex corrective pattern and is poised to enter a powerful third-wave rally. The current wave structure indicates that XRP is forming a “1-2 scenario,” with the next Wave 3 expected to launch its price significantly higher. XForceGlobal has outlined a Fibonacci Retracement zone between the $2.00 and $1.80 range as a potential entry point, with price action showing resilience near this area. The critical price level to watch for XRP is the regional low at $1.60, which acts as the most important support level that would determine the cryptocurrency’s next move. This support level is because if XRP’s price remains above it, its projected bullish scenario and current structure remain intact. On the other hand, if the price drops below it, the trend could shift bearish, potentially invalidating the bullish outlook. With $1.60 acting as a strong support foundation, XForceGlobal projects that XRP could soon surge past $3.20 and potentially reach $5.40 in the coming months. This would mark a new all-time high for XRP, representing a 40.63% increase from its current ATH of $3.84. $2.18 Flagged As Key Breakout Level For The Altcoin Sharing a similar bullish forecast, Bitcoin Benny, a crypto analyst, has shared a technical analysis of XRP on the 1-hour time frame to map out its likely price trajectory. According to the analyst, XRP is showing signs of recovery after enduring a sharp market correction in late April. Related Reading: XRP Price Pullback To $2 According To Plan For Historic Breakout To $10, Analyst Says The cryptocurrency had made a significant high of around $2.3 but underwent a dramatic drop, reportedly bottoming out at approximately $2.125, where buyers quickly stepped in to stabilize its price. This support level has since held strong, with the XRP price currently consolidating just below this point. Marked on the right side of the chart, the analyst has pinpointed a key resistance level at $2.18, labeling this level as a critical breakout point. Suppose the altcoin can decisively break and close above $2.18. In that case, Bitcoin Benny predicts that it could trigger what he calls a “send season,” which is a momentum-driven rally that could push XRP toward new levels to potentially retest its previous highs.

In a new interview with the host of the Crypto Banter YouTube channel Ran Neuner, Hayes says central banks will likely boost money printing to address worsening macroeconomic conditions that could push Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other crypto assets to much higher valuations. “I think that the setup is just perfect for a rally in risk assets, just like we saw from the third quarter of 2022 until early 2025. There’s a similar setup today. We have a lot of fear, uncertainty, doubt in the markets, and the monetary authorities, especially in America, cannot handle that, so they’re going to resort to money printing… This is all about the Treasury. [Former US Treasury Secretary] Janet Yellen printed $2.5 trillion from 2022 to 2025. Bitcoin went up 6x. [US Treasury Secretary Scott] Bessent has to do something similar. And so that’s why April 9th was the bottom, and we’re going to go much higher from here.” Hayes also predicts that the Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) metric may soon enter a downward phase after tagging the 70% level, setting alts up to outperform the flagship crypto asset. BTC.D calculates how much of the crypto market cap belongs to BTC. Bitcoin dominance currently stands at 64.81%. “I think Bitcoin dominance goes to 70%-ish. Bitcoin goes to the $150,000 level, something around there. And then we start to get the rotation into altcoins.” Bitcoin is trading for $94,030 at time of writing, down 1.8% in the last 24 hours.

44254871,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157763,1746576053,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Benchmark Initiates ‘Buy’ on Canaan, Citing Tremendous Undervaluation and Bitcoin Upside",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/canaan-benchmark-buy-rating/,"Exciting news for investors keeping an eye on the digital asset space! U.S. investment bank Benchmark has recently cast a spotlight on Nasdaq-listed Canaan , a prominent player in the Bitcoin miner sector. This move comes with a significant vote of confidence: an initiated coverage coupled with a ‘Buy’ rating and a $3 price target. Why is Benchmark Bullish on This Bitcoin Miner? Benchmark’s positive outlook on Canaan isn’t just a random pick; it’s rooted in several key aspects of the company’s operations and market position. According to reports, the firm highlighted Canaan’s distinct advantages, particularly its vertically integrated business model. This means Canaan doesn’t just mine Bitcoin; it also designs and produces the very hardware (mining machines) needed for the process. This dual capability is seen as a significant strength, offering control over the supply chain and potentially better cost management. Beyond hardware, Benchmark also pointed to Canaan’s growing self-mining operations. By using its own machines to mine Bitcoin, the company directly benefits from the network’s rewards. Furthermore, Canaan holds a notable amount of Bitcoin on its balance sheet. These holdings act as a direct lever to rising Bitcoin prices, offering additional upside potential for the company’s value. In summary, Benchmark sees these factors as key value drivers: Vertically Integrated Model: Control over hardware production and self-mining. Growing Self-Mining: Direct participation in Bitcoin mining rewards. Strong Bitcoin Holdings: Asset exposure to Bitcoin price increases. Is CAN Stock Truly Undervalued? Despite the positive fundamentals identified by Benchmark, CAN stock has experienced declines recently. However, Benchmark views this downturn as an opportunity, asserting that Canaan is significantly undervalued when compared to its peers in the Bitcoin mining and hardware manufacturing space. This valuation gap suggests that the market might not be fully appreciating Canaan’s underlying assets and business model strengths. The $3 price target set by Benchmark implies a substantial potential upside from the stock’s current trading levels, aligning with their assessment of undervaluation. For those considering cryptocurrency investment , this analysis provides a specific company to research further, especially if they believe in the long-term trajectory of Bitcoin and the infrastructure supporting it. What Does This Mean for Investors? Benchmark’s initiation of coverage with a ‘Buy’ rating is a notable event for Canaan and potential investors. It signals that a major investment bank sees significant potential in the company. While analyst ratings are just one piece of the puzzle, they can influence market sentiment and draw attention to stocks that might otherwise be overlooked. For individuals interested in gaining exposure to the Bitcoin ecosystem through equity, Canaan (CAN) now has a prominent financial institution endorsing its prospects. However, as with all investments, especially in the volatile crypto-adjacent space, potential investors should conduct their own thorough research (due diligence) and consider their own risk tolerance before making any investment decisions. The performance of Bitcoin miners like Canaan remains closely tied to the price of Bitcoin itself, which is known for its significant price swings. Conclusion: A Bullish Signal Amidst Volatility Benchmark’s ‘Buy’ rating and $3 price target on Canaan underscore a belief in the company’s core business model and its potential to capitalize on future increases in the price of Bitcoin. By highlighting its vertical integration, self-mining growth, and Bitcoin holdings, Benchmark presents a case for why Canaan might be an undervalued opportunity in the current market. While recent stock performance shows the inherent volatility, the analyst’s view suggests a positive long-term outlook based on fundamental strengths and macro trends in the cryptocurrency market. This initiation of coverage provides a fresh perspective for those exploring opportunities within the Bitcoin mining landscape.

The idea behind the project required people to scan their irises and, in exchange for their personal data, the company would reward them with a small amount of cryptocurrency, which it believed would inspire more people to sign up. Altman expressed his intention for Worldcoin as a “ proof of personhood ” because AI could mimic human behavior and talk like them, making it more difficult to tell who or what is real online. He also wanted to close the gap between the rich and the poor by giving everyone equal access to digital services without paperwork or passwords. In the beginning, Worldcoin was all hype as social media posts showed people waiting in long lines to scan their irises, especially in countries across Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Most of the volunteers were more than happy to be a part of the global tech movement, while others were in it for the free cryptocurrency the company gave everyone who scanned their irises. However, Altman’s vision of a connected and equal world began crumbling as people and governments raised concerns about the project’s privacy, data safety, fairness, and consent. Privacy groups slam Worldcoin over biometric risks and exploitation Tech experts and privacy groups warned that the biometric data from these eye scans is extremely sensitive because the information connects directly to who you are as a person. And since you can’t change your eyes like your password, a hacker could easily stalk or steal from you. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) also criticized the project by saying the company rushed to collect information from third-world countries because the people were unaware of how Worldcoin would use, protect, or delete their data. In addition, people raised concerns about consent because Worldcoin would sometimes target individuals with limited internet access or education since they are less likely to understand the risks and make a more informed decision. Some users even claimed they only registered for Worldcoin for the free cryptocurrency but did not know how the company would use their data. Worldcoin also faced scrutiny over transparency, as it failed to clearly explain how user data was stored, who had access to it, and what would happen if the company changed ownership or shut down. Although Worldcoin claimed to anonymize the data, experts pointed out that it could still be traced back to the individual with the right tools. Once a scan is in the company’s database, it could remain there indefinitely. Due to mounting concerns, various governments launched investigations into Worldcoin’s practices. Nations like Spain, Portugal, and Kenya are at the forefront of demanding Worldcoin cease operations in their regions. These actions prove that many governments globally are moving too fast, breaking several legislative laws that seek to protect user interests. Worldcoin tries to win back trust after bans Due to the government pushback, Worldcoin quickly tried to save its image and respond to the growing criticism by sharing the code behind its Orb scanning device to help people understand how it worked and prove that it wasn’t secretly collecting more data than it claimed. Furthermore, the company introduced “Personal Custody” to allow users to control their data by storing it themselves or deleting it from the database. Moreover, Worldcoin brought in independent experts to perform third-party audits to ascertain that the company’s technology and policies aligned with the regulations the way Worldcoin claimed. Despite these efforts, legal and tech experts still have mixed opinions because some say it was the first step toward making things right, while others claim that these efforts were not enough and that the company still has big problems to solve. Therefore, even after all the changes Worldcoin has made, the gap between what the company claims and what regulators believe remains wide because regulators say the company still needs to explain, fix, and prove more before the uplift bans. The Indonesian Ministry of Communication and Digital (Komdigi) plans to summon the developers of Worldcoin and WorldID next week. This action follows the temporary suspension of the platforms that collect users’ iris data for alleged regulatory violations.

A significant development signaling this trend is the recent move by a global payments giant. If you’re interested in the future of money and how large corporations are embracing digital assets, particularly stablecoin payments , this news is for you. What’s Behind the Visa Ventures Investment? Visa Ventures , the strategic investment arm of Visa, has thrown its weight behind BVNK, a company specializing in providing infrastructure for stablecoin payments. This isn’t just another small funding round; it follows BVNK’s successful $50 million Series B and represents a notable step for Visa. According to reports, the primary goal of this Visa investment is to facilitate BVNK’s expansion into the crucial U.S. stablecoin market . The United States is a massive market with growing interest in digital payments, and stablecoins offer a potential bridge between the volatility of traditional cryptocurrencies and the stability required for everyday transactions. This move suggests Visa sees tangible value in stablecoins as a payment rail, potentially for cross-border transactions, business-to-business payments, or even consumer use cases in the future. It’s a strategic play to get involved early in the infrastructure layer that could power the next generation of digital payments. Why Focus on Stablecoin Payments Now? Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specific asset, most commonly the U.S. dollar. Unlike volatile assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum, their price is pegged (or attempts to be pegged) 1:1 with a fiat currency or basket of assets. This stability makes them attractive for transactions, remittances, and settlements, areas where volatility is a major hindrance for traditional cryptocurrencies. For businesses, accepting or making payments in stablecoins offers several potential advantages: Speed: Transactions can often settle much faster than traditional bank transfers, especially internationally. Cost: Fees can be significantly lower than traditional payment processors or cross-border wire transfers. Accessibility: They operate on blockchain networks, potentially offering greater accessibility to those underserved by traditional banking. 24/7 Operation: Unlike banks, blockchain networks operate around the clock. Companies like BVNK build the necessary infrastructure – APIs, compliance tools, settlement layers – to make these benefits accessible and usable for businesses and financial institutions. What Does This Mean for BVNK ? Receiving an investment from a giant like Visa is a major validation for BVNK. Beyond the capital, it brings: Credibility: Association with a global payments leader enhances trust and reputation. Expertise: Potential access to Visa’s deep understanding of the payments landscape, regulatory environments, and network effects. Network Opportunities: Possibility of future collaborations or integrations with Visa’s vast network of partners and merchants. Accelerated U.S. Entry: The investment is specifically aimed at supporting their expansion into the U.S., a complex but lucrative market. This funding will likely be used to build out their U.S. team, navigate the regulatory landscape, develop localized products, and establish partnerships within the region. Navigating the U.S. Stablecoin Market : Challenges and Opportunities While the opportunity in the U.S. is immense, the path is not without hurdles. The regulatory environment for stablecoins in the United States is still evolving. Lawmakers and regulators are actively debating how to classify and regulate stablecoins, with potential frameworks ranging from treating issuers like banks to creating entirely new regulatory categories. Key considerations for BVNK and other players in the U.S. stablecoin market include: Regulatory Compliance: Adhering to state and federal financial regulations, including KYC/AML requirements. Licensing: Obtaining necessary money transmitter licenses or other required permits. Banking Relationships: Establishing and maintaining relationships with traditional banks for fiat on/off-ramps. Consumer Protection: Ensuring robust systems are in place to protect users. Competition: The market is attracting significant interest, leading to increased competition from both crypto-native firms and traditional finance players. Despite these challenges, the potential rewards are substantial. A clear regulatory framework, once established, could unlock significant institutional and corporate adoption of stablecoin payments , creating a massive market for infrastructure providers like BVNK. Is This the Future of Payments? Visa’s Visa investment in BVNK is a strong signal that major players in traditional finance see stablecoins not just as a niche crypto product, but as a potential component of the future global payment system. It reflects a broader trend of convergence, where the efficiency and innovation of blockchain technology are being explored for mainstream financial applications. While cash and traditional card payments are not disappearing anytime soon, the infrastructure being built today by companies like BVNK , with support from entities like Visa Ventures , is laying the groundwork for a future where digital currencies, particularly stablecoins, play a more prominent role in how businesses and individuals transact. Actionable Insight: Businesses should start exploring the potential benefits and mechanics of stablecoin payments, especially those involved in international trade or looking for faster, cheaper payment options. Understanding the infrastructure providers and the evolving regulatory landscape is crucial. In Conclusion: A Bridge Between Worlds The investment by Visa Ventures in BVNK represents a significant bridge being built between the traditional financial world and the emerging digital asset ecosystem. By backing infrastructure for stablecoin payments , Visa is positioning itself at the forefront of innovation in the payments space, specifically targeting expansion within the critical U.S. stablecoin market . This move validates the growing importance of stablecoins as a practical tool for transactions and highlights the increasing collaboration between established finance and crypto-native companies. As the regulatory picture in the U.S. becomes clearer, expect to see more such strategic partnerships and accelerated development in the stablecoin payment sector.

Artificial intelligence continues to transform how we interact with information. Google is leveraging this power with a significant update to its iOS app: the new ‘Simplify’ feature. This development in Google AI is set to make navigating dense web content much more accessible for iPhone users. What is Google AI Simplify? Google’s new ‘Simplify’ feature, integrated into the Google app for iOS, is designed to tackle the challenge of complex online text head-on. It employs advanced AI models to take complicated paragraphs and rewrite them in a simpler, more digestible format, all without requiring you to leave the page you are reading. This means you can encounter technical jargon, intricate explanations, or scientific details and get an instant, clearer version to help you understand the core message. How Does AI Text Simplification Work? The technology powering this feature is rooted in a sophisticated prompt refinement approach developed by Google Research. At its core, the ‘Simplify’ tool utilizes Google’s powerful Gemini AI models. These models are trained to understand the nuances of complex language and effectively paraphrase it. Google’s testing indicates that users who read the simplified text gain a better understanding and retain information more effectively than those reading the original, complex versions. The goal of this AI text simplification is to maintain the accuracy and integrity of the original content while removing unnecessary complexity. Consider this example provided by Google: Original Complex Text Simplified Text (by Google AI) The complex pathology of this condition involves emphysematous destruction of lung parenchyma, diffuse interstitial fibrosis, changes in the composition of lung immune cells, increased production of immunomodulatory factors, and the prominent remodeling of pulmonary vasculature. This complex condition involves damage to the lung tissue from emphysema, a disease that damages the air sacs in the lungs, and widespread scarring of the lung tissue, called fibrosis. The immune cells in the lungs change, and the body makes more immunomodulatory factors, substances that control the immune system. The blood vessels in the lungs also change a lot. As the example shows, the simplified version breaks down medical terms and sentence structures into more common language, making the underlying concepts easier to grasp for a general reader. Google Simplify: Keeping Users in the Ecosystem Google’s introduction of the Google Simplify feature is not just about improving readability; it’s also a strategic move in the competitive AI landscape. By offering a built-in tool for text simplification directly within its app, Google aims to provide users with a convenient solution that prevents them from needing to navigate away to third-party AI tools, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, for assistance with understanding complex content. This helps reinforce the Google app as a central hub for information consumption and processing on iOS devices. Accessing the iOS App Feature Using the ‘Simplify’ feature is straightforward for users on the iOS app feature . When you are viewing a web page within the Google app, you can select any portion of text that you find difficult to understand. Once the text is selected, a ‘Simplify’ icon will appear alongside other options like copy or define. Tapping this icon will generate and display the simplified version of the selected text, allowing you to quickly digest the information and continue reading the original page with enhanced comprehension. Gemini AI Powers the Magic The effectiveness of the ‘Simplify’ feature is largely thanks to the capabilities of Gemini AI . Google has emphasized that their goal with this tool is not just to shorten text, but to accurately paraphrase complex ideas. This process must be done without introducing errors or omitting crucial details. The rewritten text must genuinely assist the reader in understanding challenging material while preserving the original information’s integrity. This commitment to accuracy is vital for a tool designed to help users learn and comprehend new topics encountered online. The ‘Simplify’ feature is currently rolling out to iOS users this week, bringing a powerful new capability to the Google app. In conclusion, Google’s new ‘Simplify’ feature, powered by Gemini AI, represents a significant step in making web content more accessible. By providing an easy-to-use tool for AI text simplification directly within its iOS app feature , Google helps users quickly understand complex information and reinforces its ecosystem as a go-to resource for navigating the digital world.

44256782,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157777,1746579605,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Bitcoin OP_RETURN Debate: Developers Propose Radical Change,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-opreturn-limit-debate/,"The world of Bitcoin is rarely quiet, and a recent proposal from Bitcoin Core developers has ignited a significant discussion, bordering on a full-blown crypto debate . At the heart of the matter is a technical tweak with potentially broad implications for how data is stored on the blockchain: the humble Bitcoin OP_RETURN output. What is Bitcoin OP_RETURN and Why Does it Matter? First off, let’s break down what we’re talking about. In simple terms, an OP_RETURN output is a special type of transaction output on the Bitcoin network . Unlike regular outputs that send Bitcoin to a specific address, an OP_RETURN output is provably unspendable. Its primary purpose is to allow a small amount of arbitrary data to be embedded directly into the blockchain, typically for applications built on top of Bitcoin. The key thing here is the data limit. Currently, OP_RETURN outputs are capped at 80 bytes. This limit was introduced years ago precisely to prevent the blockchain from being filled with excessive, non-financial data, which could contribute to something called UTXO bloat . So, why does this seemingly small technical detail matter? Because how data is stored and managed directly impacts the efficiency, cost, and decentralization of the entire Bitcoin network . Changes here are a big deal. Bitcoin Developers’ Proposal: Lifting the Cap A group of prominent Bitcoin developers , specifically from the Bitcoin Core project, have put forward a proposal to remove the existing 80-byte size limit on OP_RETURN outputs entirely. Their argument is based on a technical observation: the current limit isn’t actually achieving its goal effectively and, in some cases, is making things worse. Here’s their reasoning: Workarounds Exist: The 80-byte limit doesn’t stop people from embedding more data. Developers and users find workarounds, often by using multiple OP_RETURN outputs or other, less efficient scripting methods. Worse for UTXO Bloat: These workarounds, particularly using multiple outputs, can actually be *more* harmful to the UTXO bloat problem than allowing a single, larger OP_RETURN output. Each additional output adds entries to the UTXO set, which full nodes need to track. Simplifying Rules: Removing the arbitrary limit simplifies the protocol rules, making the code cleaner and easier to maintain. In essence, the developers argue that the current limit is an ineffective dam that forces water (data) to flow around it in ways that cause more erosion ( UTXO bloat ) downstream. Removing the dam, they suggest, could lead to a more controlled and less harmful flow. The Crypto Debate Ignites: Concerns Over Spam and Consensus As you might expect in the often-passionate world of cryptocurrency, this proposal hasn’t been met with universal acclaim. It has sparked a significant crypto debate , pitting technical efficiency arguments against concerns about network use and governance. Prominent critics have voiced their opposition. Among them are figures like Samson Mow, CEO of JAN3, and Marty Bent from Ten31 Fund and the popular ‘Tales from the Crypt’ podcast. Their core arguments often revolve around: Lack of Consensus: Critics argue that such a fundamental change to how data is handled on the blockchain requires broader community consensus than currently exists for this proposal. Bitcoin development traditionally moves slowly and cautiously, prioritizing agreement across different stakeholder groups. Increased Spam Risk: The fear is that removing the limit could open the floodgates for large amounts of arbitrary, non-financial data being permanently etched onto the Bitcoin network . This could include anything from large text files to encoded images, potentially overwhelming nodes and increasing operational costs. Impact on Node Operators: Full nodes are the backbone of the Bitcoin network . Storing and validating the entire blockchain requires resources. Critics worry that increased data embedding could significantly raise these requirements, potentially pushing smaller node operators offline and leading to centralization. Changing Bitcoin’s Purpose: Some purists believe Bitcoin’s blockchain should be used *only* for financial transactions. Allowing larger data embeds, they argue, deviates from this core purpose and could set a precedent for further non-monetary use cases that compete for block space and resources. This isn’t just a technical disagreement; it touches upon philosophical questions about what the Bitcoin network is for and how its scarce resources (block space and node capacity) should be used. Benefits vs. Challenges: Weighing the Impact Let’s try to summarize the potential upsides and downsides of removing the Bitcoin OP_RETURN limit: Potential Benefits (According to Proponents): Reduced overall UTXO bloat by eliminating less efficient workarounds. Simplification of Bitcoin protocol rules and code. Potentially more efficient ways for developers to embed small amounts of necessary data for layered protocols (though this is debated). Potential Challenges (According to Critics): Increased potential for blockchain ‘spam’ or non-financial data. Higher resource requirements for running a full node on the Bitcoin network . Lack of broad community consensus for the change. Concerns about altering Bitcoin’s fundamental nature. The debate highlights a classic tension in decentralized systems: how to balance flexibility and innovation with stability and resistance to abuse. The Bitcoin developers proposing the change see it as a technical optimization to fix an existing problem, while critics see it as potentially introducing new, worse problems and bypassing established consensus-building processes. UTXO Bloat: Why is it Such a Big Deal? Let’s zoom in on UTXO bloat , as it’s central to the developers’ argument. The UTXO set (Unspent Transaction Output set) is essentially the list of all Bitcoin that currently exists and is available to be spent. Every full node on the Bitcoin network needs to keep track of this set to validate new transactions. When you receive Bitcoin, it’s added to the UTXO set as an output you can spend. When you spend it, that output is marked as spent, and new outputs are created for the recipient and any change. A large UTXO set requires more memory and processing power for nodes. If the set grows too large, it can make it harder and more expensive to run a full node, potentially leading to fewer nodes and thus less decentralization. The 80-byte OP_RETURN limit was intended to keep outputs small and unspendable, thus not contributing to the *spendable* UTXO set directly, but the *number* of outputs still matters. The developers’ point is that workarounds to the 80-byte limit often involve creating *more* outputs (even if some are OP_RETURN or other types), which increases the *size* and *complexity* of the UTXO set data that nodes must manage, arguably causing worse bloat than a single larger OP_RETURN output might. What Happens Next in This Crypto Debate? For now, this is just a proposal from a group of Bitcoin developers . As The Block reported, no release date has been set for any software update that would include this change. The nature of Bitcoin development is iterative and relies heavily on discussion, review, and eventual consensus among a distributed group of developers, users, miners, and businesses. This crypto debate will likely continue to play out on mailing lists, in online forums, and during developer calls. The technical merits of the proposal will be scrutinized, the potential risks debated, and the community’s sentiment gauged. It’s a prime example of how changes, even seemingly minor ones, in a decentralized system like the Bitcoin network require careful consideration and broad buy-in. Summary: A Technical Tweak Sparks Fundamental Questions The proposal by Bitcoin developers to remove the 80-byte limit on Bitcoin OP_RETURN outputs is more than just a technical detail; it’s a catalyst for a broader crypto debate about the future use and health of the Bitcoin network . While proponents argue it’s a necessary step to combat inefficient workarounds and reduce UTXO bloat , critics raise valid concerns about potential spam, increased node costs, and the very nature of Bitcoin’s purpose. This discussion underscores the decentralized and often contentious nature of Bitcoin development. Reaching consensus on significant changes is a slow, deliberate process, reflecting the network’s resistance to rapid alteration. How this debate evolves will be crucial to watch, as it could influence how data is managed on the blockchain for years to come.

Pro-XRP Lawyer Says Not Yet,https://coinpedia.org/news/pro-xrp-lawyer-says-ripple-lawsuit-is-not-over-yet/,"The post Is the Ripple SEC Lawsuit Over? Pro-XRP Lawyer Says Not Yet appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was one of the longest and most talked-about crypto cases in recent years. In April 2024, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said the SEC had agreed to drop the case — just like it had done with other crypto companies. However, unlike those other cases, the SEC has not officially confirmed that it is ending the Ripple lawsuit. Even so, many in the XRP community are already celebrating, thinking the case is over. But a pro-XRP lawyer warned that it’s not finished yet. He explained that some legal steps still need to happen in court before it’s truly done. It is not over yet. Things need to happen first in court https://t.co/Met98eKcc1 — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) May 7, 2025 Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, spoke out recently, asking why the SEC brought the case in the first place. He said the SEC has now dropped every crypto case in the U.S., including its appeal against Ripple. Alderoty explained that the SEC admitted it couldn’t take legal action without first clearly explaining the rules around crypto. Since there were no clear laws for crypto in the U.S., the SEC’s cases didn’t hold up. Now, Ripple wants to move forward — focusing on business, working with Congress, and helping create fair rules for crypto. Their goal is to protect consumers, keep out bad actors, and support innovation in the industry. In other news, Ripple has announced that it will stop publishing its regular quarterly reports on XRP. The company said it made this decision because the SEC used Ripple’s transparency efforts against it during their legal battle. In its Q1 2025 market report, Ripple explained that it started the reports to be open about its XRP holdings and to share information that few other crypto companies were offering. However, Ripple now says those efforts didn’t work as planned and were actually turned against them — especially by former SEC leaders.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-07 01:09:08

The launch of a new web platform by Particle AI , a company known for its innovative AI news reader , marks a significant step in how consumers access and understand digital news . This move aims to broaden access to its AI-enhanced news experience beyond its mobile app. Exploring Particle’s New Web Platform for AI News Particle has officially rolled out its web presence at Particle.news. This expansion brings the core features of its mobile application to a wider audience, offering a fresh perspective on consuming AI news . The platform aggregates headlines and provides AI-generated summaries from various sources, making it easier to quickly grasp the essence of current events. The website allows users to explore news across numerous categories, including: Technology Sports Entertainment Politics Science Crime Economics Video Games Users can also browse the day’s most popular stories directly from the homepage, ensuring they stay updated on trending topics. How Particle AI Enhances Digital News Consumption Particle’s approach goes beyond simple summaries. The platform is designed with specific AI tools to improve reader comprehension. Instead of just bullet points, Particle extracts key quotes from articles, providing direct insights from the source material. While the web version currently displays user questions and answers from the mobile app, direct AI interaction via a chatbot is planned for the future. A standout feature is the integration of ‘entity pages’. When a significant person, product, or organization is mentioned, users can click on the highlighted term to access a dedicated page. These pages provide foundational information, often sourced from Wikipedia, and crucially, link to additional stories about the subject. This creates a richer context for the news being read. Particle’s Approach to AI Publishing and Supporting Sources A critical distinction for Particle is its stated goal to support publishers, not just use their content without attribution. The platform prominently displays links to the original news outlets alongside its AI summaries. Early data from the mobile app showed readers were indeed clicking through to the publishers’ sites. This led Particle to establish partnerships with major news organizations like Reuters, Fortune, and AFP to give their links greater visibility. On the new website, related reporting links are also included at the bottom of summaries, encouraging users to explore the source material further. Sharing a link from the Particle mobile app now directs recipients to the corresponding page on the website, making the content accessible even to those without the app installed. This model presents an interesting angle in the evolving landscape of AI publishing , aiming for a symbiotic relationship rather than pure content aggregation. The Team and Funding Behind Particle AI Particle was co-founded in 2023 by Sara Beykpour, a former senior director of product management at Twitter, and Marcel Molina, a former senior engineer at Twitter and Tesla. The company has secured substantial backing, including $4.4 million in seed funding and a $10.9 million Series A round led by Lightspeed. This significant investment underscores confidence in their vision for an AI news reader that benefits both consumers and publishers. Particle in the Competitive Digital News Landscape Particle enters a space where several players are exploring the use of AI in news. Yahoo, for instance, acquired the Artifact app (created by Instagram’s co-founders) to enhance its News app with AI features. Other major news organizations like Bloomberg, Gannett, and The Wall Street Journal are also experimenting with AI for article summaries. However, Particle’s position as an independent platform specifically focused on AI summaries and Q&A might give it a different standing with readers. Users may be more accepting of AI-generated summaries and insights on a dedicated platform like Particle compared to seeing AI errors directly on the website of a trusted news source reporting original journalism. Benefits and Future Outlook The launch of the web platform is expected to significantly increase Particle’s reach, offering a new way for people to engage with digital news using AI. For readers, the benefits include quicker comprehension through summaries and quotes, deeper context via entity pages, and the ability to ask questions (though direct web interaction is future). For publishers, the potential for referral traffic through prominent linking offers a different model than pure aggregation. As AI continues to evolve, its role in how we consume information will only grow. Particle’s expansion to the web positions it as a notable player exploring how AI can enhance understanding and potentially create a more sustainable ecosystem for news dissemination.

With price back under the point of control, traders are watching closely for signs of a deeper move or a trap. Ethereum’s ( ETH ) price action has stalled at a technically significant region, the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level, drawn from the most recent pivot high to low. This area is also reinforced by daily horizontal resistance and a descending VWAP, adding to its weight as a decision zone. After several failed attempts to push higher, ETH has now begun to roll over, trading back under the point of control (POC) of the local range. Key technical points Major Resistance Cluster: The 0.618 Fibonacci aligns with daily resistance and a descending VWAP, forming a strong technical ceiling. Loss of POC: Price has fallen below the volume point of control, indicating sellers are gaining control of the short-term auction. Bearish Structure Building: Lower highs and a stalled breakout raise the probability of a move toward the next key support near $1,540. ETHUSDT Chart (4), Source: TradingView Detailed analysis After an impulsive move higher, Ethereum’s price has spent several sessions consolidating below a heavy resistance zone. The 0.618 Fibonacci level, a widely watched retracement marker, is reinforced by daily horizontal resistance and a declining VWAP drawn from the last major high. This confluence attracted notable selling pressure, and ETH has now failed multiple times to break above. What adds further caution to the current structure is the recent loss of the point of control within this region. Price has now dipped below the highest-volume node of the recent range, suggesting that the market is no longer accepting value at these levels. This often precedes range rotation or continuation in the direction of the rejection, in this case, to the downside. You might also like: Bitcoin consolidates below key resistance as lower timeframe trend develops The technical landscape also reveals a clear short-term bearish structure forming. ETH has been unable to print higher highs or maintain higher lows, increasing the probability of a broader correction. The next logical support level sits around $1,540, not only a structural level from previous sessions but also a zone with visible price inefficiencies (e.g., unfilled fair value gaps and single prints) that could act as magnets for price. This setup opens the door for a potential 10% downside move from current levels, especially if the recent swing low fails to hold. Still, traders should remain alert to the possibility of a fakeout, as Ethereum has previously shown sudden strength from similar rejection zones. What to expect in the coming price action Ethereum’s failure to break out above the 0.618 confluence zone and its rejection from the POC suggest a higher chance of rotation toward lower supports. If price breaks below the recent swing low, the $1,540 region could be the next target. However, if buyers can defend current levels and reclaim the POC, this might prove to be a local fakeout before resuming upward. For now, caution is warranted as price hovers near a decisive level.

44257380,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157778,1746580858,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Meme Coin Regulation: Explosive Bill Targets Trump’s Political Crypto,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/murphy-trump-meme-coin/,"The intersection of politics and cryptocurrency is becoming increasingly complex, and a recent move by a U.S. Senator highlights the growing concerns around potential conflicts of interest. The emergence of assets like the Trump Meme Coin has sparked debate, leading one lawmaker to take direct action aimed at curbing what he sees as blatant self-dealing in the digital asset space. This development signals a significant moment in the ongoing discussion around Meme Coin Regulation and the broader landscape of US Crypto Regulation . Senator Chris Murphy Takes Aim at Political Crypto U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) has stepped into the spotlight with a legislative proposal designed to prevent U.S. officials from leveraging their positions for personal financial gain through investments like cryptocurrencies and securities. According to reports, Senator Murphy has introduced the “MEME Act,” a bill specifically crafted to address concerns around self-dealing. The acronym ‘MEME’ itself is a pointed reference, clearly indicating the types of assets drawing legislative scrutiny. Senator Murphy’s motivation appears to be directly linked to prominent examples of politicians engaging with digital assets that may benefit them financially. He explicitly cited the promotion of the Trump Meme Coin as a prime example of the kind of behavior his bill aims to prohibit. This move underscores a growing sentiment among some lawmakers that the burgeoning world of Political Crypto requires clear ethical boundaries. The core of the MEME Act, as described, is to ban U.S. officials – a category that includes the President and other high-ranking government figures – from promoting financial instruments in which they have a personal stake. This isn’t just about cryptocurrencies; it extends to traditional securities as well. However, the bill’s name and the context in which it’s being introduced clearly place meme coins and the crypto market at the forefront of this legislative effort. What is the MEME Act and Why Now? The proposed MEME Act seeks to establish a clear legal barrier preventing government officials from using their platform or influence to boost the value of assets they own. While existing ethics rules address conflicts of interest, Senator Murphy’s bill suggests these rules may not be sufficient or explicit enough when it comes to newer asset classes like cryptocurrencies, particularly those with direct ties to political figures. Key aspects of the MEME Act likely include: Defining “U.S. Officials”: Clarifying who is covered by the ban, likely including elected officials, appointed officials, and potentially their immediate families. Defining “Promoting”: Establishing what constitutes promotion of a financial interest. This could range from explicit endorsements to more subtle mentions or actions that could influence market perception. Scope of Assets: Explicitly including cryptocurrencies (with a potential focus on meme coins or politically-themed tokens) alongside traditional securities. Enforcement Mechanisms: Outlining how the ban would be enforced and what penalties officials might face for violations. The timing of this bill is crucial. It comes as discussions around comprehensive US Crypto Regulation are intensifying on Capitol Hill. Lawmakers are grappling with how to oversee the crypto market, protect investors, and prevent illicit activity. Against this backdrop, the high-profile nature of assets like the Trump Meme Coin and the public figures associated with them has seemingly accelerated calls for specific rules addressing potential ethical breaches. The Trump Meme Coin Controversy The specific mention of the Trump Meme Coin by Senator Chris Murphy highlights a particular flashpoint in the political crypto space. While many meme coins are based on internet jokes or cultural trends, a subset has emerged directly tied to political figures or movements. These tokens often gain value based on speculation, community hype, and their connection to the personality they represent. The controversy arises when the individual associated with the coin is also a public official or a candidate for office. Critics argue that any action or statement by that individual that could be perceived as positive towards the crypto market, or even just increasing their overall public profile, could inadvertently (or intentionally) benefit the value of a token tied to them. This creates a potential conflict of interest, where an official’s public duties or political activities could be influenced by their personal financial holdings or those of their associates. Senator Murphy’s characterization of the promotion of such coins as “blatant corruption” reflects the strong negative sentiment some feel towards this phenomenon. It raises questions about the ethics of officials holding or appearing to endorse assets whose value is so directly linked to their own political fortunes or public statements. Is Political Crypto Inherently Problematic? The rise of Political Crypto raises complex questions. On one hand, digital assets can be seen as another form of investment, and individuals, including politicians, have the right to invest. On the other hand, the unique nature of meme coins and politically themed tokens, combined with the power and influence wielded by public officials, creates a potential for abuse that may exceed that of traditional investments. Arguments against officials holding or promoting such assets include: Conflict of Interest: Decisions or statements made in their official capacity could impact the value of their holdings. Market Manipulation Risk: A public figure’s endorsement could cause significant, speculative price swings that harm uninformed investors. Erosion of Public Trust: It can create the perception that officials are prioritizing personal wealth over public service. Unfair Advantage: Officials may have access to information or influence that gives them an edge in the market. However, defining the line can be tricky. Does attending a crypto conference constitute promotion? What about simply owning crypto assets? The MEME Act aims to draw a clearer line, focusing specifically on active “promotion” of assets where the official has a personal financial interest. Navigating the Challenges of Meme Coin Regulation Regulating meme coins presents unique challenges compared to more traditional financial assets or even cryptocurrencies with clear utility. Their value is often driven by intangible factors like community sentiment, social media trends, and celebrity endorsements rather than underlying technology or business models. Key challenges for Meme Coin Regulation include: Defining a Meme Coin: How do you legally define a meme coin distinct from other cryptocurrencies or securities? Volatility: Their extreme price swings make them high-risk, potentially leading to significant losses for investors, but also making them attractive targets for pump-and-dump schemes. Decentralization vs. Centralization: While some crypto projects are genuinely decentralized, others have central figures or teams, making it easier to identify responsible parties for regulation. Meme coins often blur this line. Global Nature: Crypto markets are global, making enforcement of national regulations complex. Despite these challenges, the push for regulation, exemplified by Senator Chris Murphy ‘s MEME Act, indicates a growing resolve among some policymakers to bring more oversight to this corner of the market, especially when it intersects with political figures. Broader Implications for US Crypto Regulation The MEME Act, while focused on official conduct and specific assets like the Trump Meme Coin , is part of a larger legislative trend concerning US Crypto Regulation . Congress and various regulatory bodies are actively debating and proposing rules covering a wide range of crypto activities, including exchanges, stablecoins, NFTs, and decentralized finance (DeFi). This bill could potentially set a precedent for how officials’ interactions with the crypto market are viewed and regulated. It signals that lawmakers are paying close attention not just to the technology itself, but to the ethical implications of its adoption and promotion, particularly by those in positions of power. The debate around this bill will likely touch upon fundamental issues like free speech, the definition of a security, and the appropriate scope of government oversight in rapidly evolving markets. As lawmakers advance digital asset regulations, the focus on preventing self-dealing and maintaining public trust is becoming increasingly prominent. What Does This Mean for Investors and the Public? For investors in meme coins or other cryptocurrencies, this legislative action highlights the inherent risks, including regulatory uncertainty. It underscores that assets tied to personalities or fleeting trends are subject to unique pressures, including political scrutiny. For the public, the MEME Act is presented as a measure to safeguard against corruption and ensure that officials are acting in the public interest, not their personal financial interest. It’s a reminder that as new technologies emerge, the ethical frameworks governing public service must adapt. Actionable insights from this development: Stay Informed: Keep track of legislative developments like the MEME Act and other proposed US Crypto Regulation . Understand Risks: Be aware that meme coins and political tokens carry significant risks, including volatility and potential regulatory action. Demand Transparency: Support calls for greater transparency regarding the financial holdings and potential conflicts of interest of public officials. Engage in the Debate: Understand the arguments for and against stricter Meme Coin Regulation and make your voice heard if possible. Conclusion: A Crucial Step in Defining Ethical Boundaries? Senator Chris Murphy ‘s introduction of the MEME Act represents a pointed effort to address perceived ethical lapses at the intersection of politics and the digital asset market. By specifically targeting the promotion of personal financial interests through assets like the Trump Meme Coin , the bill aims to draw a clear line against self-dealing by U.S. officials. While the path to becoming law is uncertain and the bill is likely to face debate and potential challenges, its introduction is a significant development. It brings the controversial world of Political Crypto into sharp legislative focus and highlights the growing urgency felt by some lawmakers to establish clear ethical boundaries within the broader framework of US Crypto Regulation . The outcome of this legislative effort could have lasting implications for how public officials interact with digital assets and for the future of Meme Coin Regulation itself.

Richard Blumenthal, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations within the Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs, sent letters on Tuesday to Bill Zanker of Fight Fight Fight LLC and Zach Witkoff, co-founder of World Liberty Financial. Senate panel investigates Trump-affiliated crypto ventures for potential conflicts of interest These letters contained inquiries about the ownership and investment structure of several Trump-affiliated entities, including Fight Fight Fight LLC (the company behind the TRUMP meme coin), CIC Digital LLC (which issued Trump’s NFTs and co-owns Fight Fight Fight), Celebration Cards LLC (another Trump-affiliated NFT entity), DTTM Operations LLC (which manages Trump’s intellectual property), as well as World Liberty Financial and its affiliates. According to the letters, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations is conducting a preliminary inquiry into potential conflicts of interest and legal violations involving President Trump’s cryptocurrency ventures and the financial dealings of associated businesses with foreign nationals, foreign governments, and other cryptocurrency firms. One letter referenced World Liberty Financial, while the other pointed to the $TRUMP meme coin. The letters suggested that these businesses “may be enabling the violation of government ethics requirements” and posed several questions for the companies’ executives. These included inquiries on how the companies block investments from foreign governments, their revenue generation, and whether individuals facing prosecution or investigations can participate. Additionally, the letters requested records linked to the Trump-affiliated crypto businesses. Democrats push back as Trump’s crypto dealings trigger legislative resistance As Democrats are currently in the minority in the Senate, Blumenthal lacks subpoena power unless his Republican counterpart, Sen. Ron Johnson, agrees to support the effort. A spokesperson for Johnson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Democrats have sounded the alarm over Trump’s crypto businesses in recent days. Earlie r Tu esday, Rep. Maxine Waters, who leads her party on the House Financial Services Committee, objected to a joint hearing with the House Agriculture Committee to address market structure legislation and instead hosted her own hearing focused on these crypto tie-ups. A weekend statement from Sen. Ruben Gallego and several other Democrats, indicating they would not support the Senate’s stablecoin bill, also appears to be linked to Trump’s crypto activities. In particular, Eric Trump’s announcement that the Abu Dhabi-based investment firm MGX would use the Trump-affiliated USD1 stablecoin to close a $2 billion investment into Binance has raised concerns. Additionally, Sen. Chris Murphy introduced a bill on Tuesday to ban the U.S. president and other senior government officials from issuing meme coins or other financial assets. Trump’s expanding crypto ventures raise concerns over transparency and foreign influence Donald Trump, who had previously criticized cryptocurrencies during his time as President, has since embraced the digital asset space through various ventures. His financial involvement in the crypto world has expanded considerably from the existing sale of Trump-branded NFTs in 2022 to the more recent endorsement of the $TRUMP meme coin project. While the investments appear to be all about brand monetization, the businesses are controversial because they are owned in a non-transparent manner and linked to foreign investors. The Senate’s inquiry centers around several entities linked to Trump’s digital asset activities. These entities collectively represent a network of financial and promotional tools that have drawn scrutiny due to their potential for foreign funding and political implications. At the heart of the investigation is the question of whether these cryptocurrency businesses could enable influence-buying or foreign interference in American politics. Lawmakers fear that without proper oversight, such ventures might violate U.S. ethics laws and potentially allow adversarial entities to gain backdoor access to a future Trump presidency. Government ethics rules prohibit federal officials from profiting off their positions or using their brand in ways that could present conflicts of interest. If Trump’s crypto ventures are found to be accepting investments from foreign actors or enabling individuals facing legal scrutiny to participate, it could lead to significant legal and political fallout.

While it might sound like something out of a futuristic novel, major financial institutions are starting to explore this very possibility. A recent report from investment banking giant Morgan Stanley has ignited fresh debate, suggesting that Bitcoin U.S. reserve asset status might not be as far-fetched as some believe, though significant hurdles remain. What Did the Morgan Stanley Bitcoin Report Reveal? According to insights from The Crypto Basic, the core of the Morgan Stanley Bitcoin report centers on Bitcoin’s sheer size. With a market capitalization hovering around $1.87 trillion (figures can fluctuate), Bitcoin has grown large enough to be considered alongside traditional reserve assets. The report indicates that holding between 12% and 17% of Bitcoin’s total supply could align with conventional standards for national reserves. This isn’t just a theoretical exercise. For an asset to be considered a viable reserve, it typically needs deep liquidity, a significant market size, and a degree of global acceptance. Bitcoin, despite its relatively young age compared to gold or major fiat currencies, is starting to tick some of these boxes, at least in terms of market valuation. However, Morgan Stanley was quick to temper expectations. While the market cap is impressive, the report explicitly highlighted that Bitcoin’s notorious volatility remains a major challenge. Reserve assets are meant to provide stability and confidence, not subject a nation’s wealth to wild price swings. Unpacking the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Proposal The discussion around Bitcoin as a U.S. reserve asset isn’t happening in a vacuum. It’s closely linked to a growing, albeit controversial, movement advocating for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . This proposal, gaining traction among some policymakers, suggests the U.S. should proactively accumulate Bitcoin as a strategic national asset. Proponents argue that such a reserve would: Act as a Hedge: Potentially protect against inflation and the devaluation of fiat currencies. Ensure Future Relevance: Position the U.S. at the forefront of the digital asset revolution. Diversify National Wealth: Offer an alternative to traditional assets that may face different economic pressures. Strengthen National Security: Potentially provide a non-sovereign asset base less susceptible to political pressure tied to fiat systems. This idea, however, faces considerable opposition. Critics raise concerns about the risks involved, the lack of historical precedent for a nation holding such a volatile and decentralized asset, and the potential political fallout from significant losses if the market declines. The Double-Edged Sword: Potential Benefits vs. Bitcoin Volatility Risk Let’s delve deeper into the core tension identified by Morgan Stanley: the potential benefits versus the significant risk. The allure of holding a Bitcoin U.S. reserve asset is clear for its proponents: Diversification: Bitcoin’s price movements have historically shown low correlation with traditional assets like stocks and bonds, offering potential diversification benefits to a national portfolio. Inflation Hedge Narrative: Often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ Bitcoin’s fixed supply (capped at 21 million coins) appeals to those seeking a store of value resistant to inflationary pressures caused by excessive money printing. Potential for Appreciation: While risky, the long-term growth trajectory of Bitcoin offers the possibility of significant returns, potentially increasing national wealth. Embracing the Digital Future: Holding Bitcoin signals a nation’s readiness to engage with the evolving digital economy and potentially participate in future decentralized financial systems. However, these benefits are shadowed by the substantial Bitcoin volatility risk . Unlike gold or stable government bonds, Bitcoin’s price can swing dramatically – 10%, 20%, or even more in a single day. For a national reserve, which is meant to be a bedrock of economic stability and confidence, such volatility is deeply problematic. Imagine the public reaction if a significant portion of the nation’s wealth were to drop by billions or trillions of dollars overnight due to a market correction. This inherent instability is the primary reason why central banks and treasuries have been hesitant to embrace Bitcoin as a core reserve asset, despite growing institutional interest. Beyond Borders: The Global View on Cryptocurrency Reserve While the U.S. debate is prominent, the idea of a Cryptocurrency reserve is being quietly considered in various forms globally. El Salvador famously adopted Bitcoin as legal tender and holds some Bitcoin on its balance sheet, though this is a unique case for a smaller economy and differs from a large-scale reserve strategy for a major power. Other nations are exploring Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) as a digital evolution of their fiat currency, which is a different concept entirely from holding decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin as a reserve. The global landscape shows a mix of curiosity, caution, and outright skepticism towards integrating decentralized cryptocurrencies into national balance sheets. No major developed nation has yet signaled concrete plans to establish a significant Cryptocurrency reserve based on Bitcoin or similar assets, primarily due to the same risks identified by Morgan Stanley – volatility, regulatory clarity, and security. What’s Next? Navigating the Future of Digital Reserves The Morgan Stanley report, coupled with the ongoing debate around a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve , underscores a critical juncture in global finance. It highlights that major financial players are seriously evaluating the potential role of digital assets like Bitcoin at the highest levels. For investors, this ongoing conversation is significant. It suggests continued institutional interest and potential future adoption, which could influence market dynamics. However, it also reinforces the need for caution and a clear understanding of the inherent risks, particularly volatility. For policymakers, the challenge is immense. They must weigh the potential long-term benefits of embracing digital assets against the immediate and significant risks. Key questions revolve around: Developing robust and secure custody solutions for national digital asset holdings. Establishing clear regulatory frameworks. Addressing the energy consumption debate surrounding proof-of-work cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Gaining political and public consensus for such a move. The path forward for a Bitcoin U.S. reserve asset is anything but certain. It involves complex technical, economic, and political considerations. The conversation is evolving rapidly, driven by technological innovation and shifting global economic landscapes. In Conclusion: Morgan Stanley’s assessment that Bitcoin’s market cap makes it large enough to be considered a U.S. reserve asset is a landmark statement, reflecting the maturation of the cryptocurrency market. It validates the scale Bitcoin has achieved. However, the report’s equally strong emphasis on the lingering threat of volatility serves as a crucial reminder of the challenges that must be addressed before Bitcoin could realistically join the ranks of traditional, stability-focused national reserves. The debate over a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve will undoubtedly continue, pushing boundaries and forcing a deeper examination of what constitutes value and security in the digital age.

This isn’t just a technical story; it’s about how a leading AI company structures itself, impacts investors, and navigates intense regulatory scrutiny. The latest update involves a major OpenAI Restructuring plan, moving away from its previous, somewhat unusual setup. This shift has big implications, not least for potential IPO Prospects and how the company balances its mission with commercial goals. Why the Shift in Corporate Structure? OpenAI announced a new corporate structure plan following discussions with attorneys general in Delaware and California. These states have been watching closely as OpenAI sought to change its unique arrangement where a nonprofit board oversees for-profit operations. The core of the new plan is to convert OpenAI’s for-profit entity into a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC). However, this PBC will still remain under the control of OpenAI’s original nonprofit board. This change aims to address concerns from both regulators and investors. Regulators are interested in ensuring AI development benefits humanity, aligning with OpenAI’s stated mission. Investors, who have poured billions into the company, expect a return on their investment. A more conventional Corporate Structure could potentially satisfy both parties, offering greater clarity and potentially simplifying future fundraising efforts. What Does Public Benefit Corporation Mean for OpenAI? A Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) is a type of for-profit entity that is legally required to consider the impact of its decisions not only on shareholders but also on society and the environment. While still focused on profit, a PBC has a broader mission embedded in its charter. In OpenAI’s case, this likely means the PBC will be obligated to consider the benefit of artificial general intelligence for all humanity, echoing the nonprofit’s original charter. Under the proposed structure, the OpenAI nonprofit will control and hold a significant shareholder position in the new PBC. This differs from a previous plan that would have spun the for-profit arm out from under the nonprofit’s direct control. This continued control by the nonprofit, while potentially appeasing some concerns about mission alignment, introduces complexities, particularly regarding asset ownership and decision-making authority. Navigating AI Regulation and Legal Pressure The backdrop to this OpenAI Restructuring is increasing pressure from various fronts, including growing calls for clearer AI Regulation . Attorneys general have been involved, reviewing OpenAI’s plans to ensure they align with legal and charitable obligations. Just recently, former OpenAI employees urged state AGs to block the restructuring, arguing it conflicted with the company’s founding charitable principles. Major investors, including Microsoft and Softbank, are also key stakeholders. Their multi-billion-dollar investments are reportedly contingent on a successful restructuring. Microsoft, OpenAI’s largest partner, is reportedly seeking assurances that its investment is adequately protected under the new Corporate Structure . Approval from these key investors is crucial for the plan’s success. Perhaps the most public pressure comes from Elon Musk, an OpenAI co-founder now competing with the company. Musk has not only filed a lawsuit accusing OpenAI of abandoning its nonprofit mission but also reportedly made a significant takeover bid for the nonprofit assets to complicate the for-profit transition. A recent court decision denying some of OpenAI’s motions in Musk’s lawsuit was seen as a small win for him and may have influenced OpenAI’s change in course, though OpenAI leadership has reportedly denied this connection. Challenges for OpenAI’s IPO Prospects One significant question raised by the new structure is its impact on OpenAI’s IPO Prospects . While the shift to a Public Benefit Corporation makes a public offering theoretically possible (nonprofits cannot go public, but PBCs can), experts highlight potential hurdles. A major challenge is the ownership of core intellectual property (IP). Corporate governance experts like Stephen Diamond note that if the critical AI technology and IP remain at the nonprofit level, merely licensed to the PBC, what exactly would an IPO represent? Shareholders typically invest in a company that owns and controls its primary assets. If the PBC only has a license to the valuable IP held by the nonprofit, the investment proposition becomes less clear and potentially less attractive to public market investors. Furthermore, the continued control by the nonprofit board means shareholders in the PBC would likely have limited influence over major corporate decisions, unlike in a typical public company. This limited shareholder control could make an IPO much more difficult, according to experts like Rose Chan Loui from UCLA’s Law Program on Philanthropy and Nonprofits. While OpenAI states an IPO is theoretically possible under the plan, they currently have no intention of going public, according to a spokesperson. What Does This Mean for the Future? OpenAI’s decision to pursue this new Corporate Structure is a direct response to the complex web of regulatory scrutiny, investor expectations, and internal/external pressures it faces. The move to a Public Benefit Corporation controlled by the nonprofit attempts to bridge the gap between its mission and commercial realities. However, the path forward is not without challenges. The structure’s complexity, particularly regarding IP ownership and shareholder influence, casts a shadow over future IPO Prospects and fundraising efforts. Success hinges on appeasing regulators, securing investor confidence (especially Microsoft’s), and navigating ongoing legal battles, such as the one with Elon Musk. The outcome of this OpenAI Restructuring will be a critical case study in how leading AI companies balance rapid commercialization with ethical considerations and their founding missions, all under the watchful eye of increasing AI Regulation .

According to a report by Watcher Guru, New Hampshire’s governor has officially signed into law a bill that permits the state to invest portions of its general fund and revenue stabilization fund directly into Bitcoin and other digital assets. This move positions New Hampshire at the forefront of US State Crypto adoption, making it the first state to finalize legislation introducing Bitcoin as a reserve asset at the state level. What Does the New Hampshire Bitcoin Law Actually Do? At its core, the newly signed legislation grants the New Hampshire state treasurer the explicit authority to manage investments in digital assets. This isn’t just a theoretical possibility; the law specifically allows for the allocation of funds from two key state accounts: the general fund and the revenue stabilization fund. These funds are crucial for the state’s financial health, covering everything from daily operations to preparing for economic downturns. Here’s a breakdown of the key aspects of this law: Investment Authority: The state treasurer is empowered to invest in Bitcoin and other digital assets. Eligible Funds: Investments can be made using money from the state’s general fund and revenue stabilization fund. Asset Class Expansion: This adds digital assets to the list of approved investment vehicles for state funds, which traditionally include things like bonds, stocks, and other conventional assets. Oversight: While the treasurer has the authority, the management and specific strategies would likely be subject to established state investment protocols and potentially further guidelines. This is a departure from the norm. While some municipalities or public pension funds might have explored indirect exposure or specific blockchain technologies, this is the first instance of a US state directly authorizing investment in Bitcoin as a reserve asset via finalized legislation. Why is This State Bitcoin Investment So Significant? The significance of New Hampshire’s decision cannot be overstated. It represents a tangible step by a US state government to embrace a new and often debated asset class. For years, discussions around Government Bitcoin Adoption have largely been theoretical or focused on national governments (like El Salvador). New Hampshire brings this conversation to the state level within the United States. Consider these points on its significance: First of Its Kind: As the first state with finalized legislation for direct state-level Bitcoin investment, New Hampshire sets a precedent. Legitimacy Boost: A state government treating Bitcoin as a legitimate investment option, even for a portion of its funds, lends credibility to the asset class in the eyes of traditional finance and other governmental bodies. Potential Catalyst: This could encourage other states to explore similar possibilities, leading to a domino effect of State Bitcoin Investment discussions and potential legislation across the country. Reserve Asset Focus: The mention of using funds like the revenue stabilization fund suggests an interest in Bitcoin not just for speculative gain, but potentially as a hedge or alternative store of value, aligning with a Bitcoin Reserve Strategy. This isn’t merely an abstract policy discussion; it’s a concrete legislative action that could influence future financial strategies for public funds. Potential Benefits: Why Would a State Invest in Bitcoin? Investing public funds comes with immense responsibility. New Hampshire’s lawmakers and governor likely weighed the potential benefits against the risks. So, what might be the motivations behind this pioneering New Hampshire Bitcoin Law? Possible benefits include: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin is often touted as a potential hedge against inflation due to its fixed supply. States, like individuals and corporations, are susceptible to the devaluation of fiat currency. Allocating a small percentage to Bitcoin could be seen as a way to preserve purchasing power over the long term. Potential for High Returns: While volatile, Bitcoin has historically offered significant returns over certain periods, outperforming many traditional assets. A prudent, small allocation could potentially boost overall portfolio performance. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset like Bitcoin to a traditional portfolio of stocks and bonds can potentially reduce overall portfolio risk, although Bitcoin’s correlation can change. Attracting Innovation and Talent: By embracing digital assets, New Hampshire might signal that it is a forward-thinking state, potentially attracting blockchain companies, crypto entrepreneurs, and tech talent, boosting its local economy. Exploring Future Financial Technologies: Governments need to understand emerging technologies. Investing in digital assets provides hands-on experience and understanding of this evolving financial landscape. These potential benefits highlight a strategic perspective, looking beyond short-term price movements towards long-term financial health and technological engagement. What Are the Challenges and Risks Involved? No investment is without risk, and digital assets are known for their volatility. The New Hampshire decision is not without its potential downsides and challenges. Key challenges and risks include: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can experience dramatic swings in short periods. This volatility could lead to significant paper losses on the state’s investments, potentially drawing criticism. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the US is still evolving. Changes in federal or state regulations could impact the legality or viability of such investments. Security Risks: Holding digital assets requires robust security measures to prevent hacking, theft, or loss of private keys. State funds would need institutional-grade security protocols. Custody Issues: Securely storing digital assets (custody) is complex. The state treasurer’s office would need to navigate reliable and secure custody solutions. Public Perception: Not all citizens or lawmakers may agree with using public funds for volatile assets like Bitcoin. There could be public relations challenges and political debate. Lack of Precedent: Being the first means there’s no established playbook for a US state managing a Bitcoin reserve. They will be navigating uncharted territory. These risks underscore the need for careful planning, robust risk management, and transparency in how these investments are handled. How Might This Influence Other States? New Hampshire’s pioneering step could very well serve as a case study for other states. Governments often look to their peers for successful models and policy ideas. If New Hampshire’s State Bitcoin Investment proves successful, demonstrating prudent management and potential benefits, it could accelerate discussions elsewhere. States might consider: Forming Study Committees: Legislatures might form committees to study the feasibility and implications of digital asset investments for state funds. Drafting Similar Legislation: Lawmakers in other states might draft bills mirroring New Hampshire’s law, tailoring it to their specific state’s financial structure and legal framework. Exploring Different Digital Assets: While Bitcoin is often the entry point, states might also look into other digital assets or broader blockchain-related investments. Developing Specific Investment Guidelines: States would need to develop clear guidelines on what percentage of funds can be invested, which assets are permissible, and risk management protocols. The US State Crypto landscape is still nascent, but New Hampshire’s action has certainly injected momentum into the conversation. Is This Part of a Broader Government Bitcoin Adoption Trend? While New Hampshire is the first state with this specific law, there have been other instances of government entities interacting with crypto. Cities like Miami have explored initiatives involving crypto, and some public pension funds have gained exposure through investment in companies or funds related to blockchain and digital assets, albeit often indirectly. Globally, El Salvador famously adopted Bitcoin as legal tender, a much more radical step than New Hampshire’s investment strategy. However, New Hampshire’s move is significant because it occurs within the US federal system and involves state-level reserve management. This action by New Hampshire contributes to a growing narrative around Government Bitcoin Adoption, suggesting that even within developed economies, public entities are starting to seriously consider how digital assets fit into traditional financial systems and investment strategies. It moves the conversation from ‘if’ governments will engage with crypto to ‘how’ and ‘when’. Actionable Insights for the Reader What does New Hampshire’s decision mean for you, whether you’re a crypto investor, a taxpayer, or just following the news? Here are some takeaways: Increased Legitimacy: This state-level approval adds another layer of legitimacy to Bitcoin and digital assets, potentially influencing broader public and institutional perception. Watch Other States: Keep an eye on legislative developments in other states. New Hampshire’s move could trigger similar proposals elsewhere. Understand Public Finance: This highlights how public funds are managed and the evolving strategies states might employ to ensure financial stability and growth. Risk Management is Key: The risks faced by a state investing in Bitcoin are similar to those faced by individual investors – volatility, security, regulatory changes. This underscores the importance of robust risk management in any crypto investment. Potential for Infrastructure Growth: Increased government interest could spur the development of more secure and regulated infrastructure for holding and managing digital assets. New Hampshire’s New Hampshire Bitcoin Law isn’t just local news; it has implications for the wider digital asset ecosystem. Conclusion: A Landmark Step Towards a Digital Future? New Hampshire’s decision to allow state investment in Bitcoin and other digital assets is a landmark event in the US. By granting the state treasurer the authority to allocate portions of key state funds into this new asset class, New Hampshire has become the first state to enact finalized legislation supporting a Bitcoin Reserve Strategy at the state level. While potential benefits like inflation hedging, diversification, and attracting innovation are clear, the state must also navigate the significant challenges posed by volatility, security risks, and regulatory uncertainty. This move is a crucial development in the broader trend of Government Bitcoin Adoption and could serve as a blueprint or catalyst for other states considering similar steps. It signals a growing recognition of digital assets within traditional finance and governance structures in the United States.

44258666,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157783,1746583244,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shock: US Crypto Regulation Hearing Collapses Over Donald Trump Crypto Ties,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-crypto-hearing-collapses/,"A highly anticipated joint congressional hearing aimed at tackling the complexities of US crypto regulation recently ended in dramatic fashion, collapsing before it even truly began. This sudden breakdown wasn’t due to a lack of interest in the topic, but rather a deep political rift centered around concerns over former U.S. President Donald Trump crypto connections and the potential for conflicts of interest among officials involved in the digital asset space. Why the House Crypto Hearing Hit a Wall The planned session was intended to bring together lawmakers from different committees to discuss and potentially forge a path forward for comprehensive US crypto regulation . However, according to reports, House Democrats raised significant objections, fundamentally disagreeing with the scope and focus proposed for the joint meeting. Their primary concern? The growing involvement of prominent political figures, including former President Donald Trump crypto activities, in the digital asset market. This fundamental disagreement proved insurmountable, leading to the unprecedented decision to scrap the joint format. Instead of a unified front, lawmakers retreated to their respective corners: Republicans: Proceeded with a separate roundtable discussion focused primarily on the technical and economic aspects of crypto regulation, aiming to understand the technology and potential frameworks for oversight. Democrats: Convened their own meeting, shifting the focus sharply towards ethics, potential corruption risks associated with politicians holding or promoting digital assets, and discussing the possibility of a politician crypto ban . This split starkly illustrates the deep divisions within Congress regarding how to approach the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrencies. It’s not just about technology or finance; it’s increasingly becoming entangled with political ethics and potential conflicts of interest. The Donald Trump Crypto Connection: A Point of Contention The specific mention of Donald Trump crypto ties as a reason for the hearing’s collapse highlights a growing concern among some lawmakers. As a former president and potential future candidate, his engagement with digital assets – including owning crypto and promoting related ventures – raises questions about potential influence and whether his financial interests could impact future policy decisions should he return to office or continue to be a public figure influencing policy debates. Democrats argued that ignoring these potential ethical issues and conflicts of interest would render any regulatory discussion incomplete or even compromised. They believe that establishing clear ethical guidelines, or even implementing a politician crypto ban on trading or profiting from digital assets while in office, is a necessary prerequisite for developing fair and effective US crypto regulation . The Intensifying Crypto Policy Debate This incident underscores how the crypto policy debate in the U.S. is multifaceted and often contentious. While there’s broad agreement that some form of regulation is needed, there’s significant disagreement on: Key Areas of Disagreement in the Crypto Policy Debate: Area Republican Focus (Generally) Democrat Focus (Generally) Primary Goal Fostering innovation, market clarity, investor protection through defined rules. Consumer protection, financial stability, preventing illicit use, addressing ethical concerns. Regulatory Approach Potentially creating new frameworks, assigning clear agency roles (CFTC vs. SEC). Utilizing existing regulations where possible, strong enforcement, potentially new ethics rules. Key Concerns Over-regulation stifling growth, lack of clarity, U.S. competitiveness. Fraud, scams, market manipulation, systemic risk, political conflicts of interest. Ethics Angle Less emphasized in general regulatory discussions. High priority, focus on transparency and potential restrictions for officials. The collapse of the joint House crypto hearing is a clear symptom of this broader political deadlock. When lawmakers can’t even agree on the agenda for discussing US crypto regulation , passing comprehensive legislation becomes an even more daunting challenge. Pushing for a Politician Crypto Ban The Democrats’ decision to hold a separate session specifically focused on proposing a politician crypto ban highlights their urgency regarding this ethical dimension. Similar to rules preventing insider trading in traditional markets, proponents argue that officials making decisions about crypto policy should not be in a position to profit from those decisions based on their holdings or privileged information. This proposal aims to remove potential conflicts of interest and build public trust in the regulatory process. Whether such a ban gains traction remains to be seen, but its emergence as a central point of discussion demonstrates the increasing scrutiny on the intersection of personal finance, political power, and the digital asset landscape. The concerns over Donald Trump crypto holdings likely serve as a prominent example fueling this push. What This Means for the Future of US Crypto Regulation The failure of this House crypto hearing is undoubtedly a setback for those hoping for swift and clear US crypto regulation . It signals that political disagreements, particularly those touching upon ethics and high-profile figures like Donald Trump crypto involvement, can easily derail progress. Challenges Ahead: Continued Uncertainty: The lack of a unified approach leaves the crypto industry and investors operating in a fragmented and uncertain regulatory environment. Slow Pace of Legislation: Deep political divisions make passing comprehensive crypto bills through both the House and Senate a difficult, time-consuming process. Focus Shift: The emphasis on ethical concerns, while important, can sometimes overshadow broader discussions about market structure, innovation, and consumer protection frameworks. While separate discussions are still happening, they lack the potential impact of a joint, bipartisan effort. Moving forward, bridging this political divide will be crucial for establishing effective US crypto regulation that fosters innovation while protecting consumers and ensuring market integrity. The entanglement of the crypto policy debate with the personal financial interests of politicians, highlighted by the focus on figures like Donald Trump crypto connections and the call for a politician crypto ban , adds a complex layer to an already challenging legislative task. Conclusion: Political Gridlock Delays Crypto Clarity The dramatic collapse of the planned joint House crypto hearing is a stark reminder of the political hurdles facing the development of clear US crypto regulation . Deep disagreements, fueled in part by concerns over high-profile figures like Donald Trump crypto ties and calls for a politician crypto ban , have split lawmakers into separate camps with differing priorities. This fragmentation slows progress on a critical issue for the digital asset industry and leaves stakeholders waiting for clarity. Until these political divisions can be bridged, the path towards comprehensive crypto policy debate and effective regulation in the United States will remain challenging and uncertain.

With trading volume climbing and features like LaunchLab and perpetuals gaining traction, the big question returns: Can RAY break back to $8 or maybe even $18 before the end of 2025? Raydium has solid momentum, but there’s another name drawing attention quickly. Unstaked (UNSD) , a low-market-cap AI project, just raised nearly $1 million in under a week through its public presale. Unlike many early tokens, Unstaked already has AI agent infrastructure built and planned to launch right after the token listing. Let’s break down where Raydium could go next, and why Unstaked might offer even bigger potential in timing, utility, and return. Raydium Forecast: Solid Growth Ahead, But Some Volatility First Raydium’s April rally brought it back into the spotlight. Analysts tracking key signals like the RSI and MFI are noticing a possible cooldown coming. With RSI at 74.46 and MFI above 80, the data points to overbought territory, and some believe a dip toward $2.20 could be next. That said, the bigger picture still looks good for Raydium. As Solana bounces back and meme coin trading stays strong, Raydium could keep rising. It’s already holding its spot as the third-biggest DEX by volume, at times even beating Uniswap v3. New tools like LaunchLab and upcoming cross-chain moves through Wormhole could push the project even further. Analyst models suggest RAY could close the year somewhere between $3 and $8. Looking ahead to 2030, some bullish projections even call for $15 to $30 if DeFi keeps gaining traction and Raydium keeps improving. Unstaked (UNSD): AI-Powered Growth With Early ROI Potential While Raydium benefits from Solana’s DeFi rebound, Unstaked brings something entirely new: AI agents built to scale Web3 communities with no human input. Unstaked lets users launch smart AI agents that handle tasks like posting, moderating, and boosting engagement on platforms like Telegram and X. These agents aren’t in testing; they’re complete systems set to go live once the token lists, ready to support Web3 projects hands-free. What sets it apart is its Proof of Intelligence (PoI) system, a built-in reward system that tracks agent performance and pays in UNSD tokens only when the work meets set standards. Put simply, no work means no reward. This makes for a transparent AI setup where everything depends on real output. Right now, Unstaked is in Stage 2 of its public presale at $0.006695, aiming for a $0.1819 launch price. That means early buyers could see 2,700% ROI, backed by a $20 million liquidity pool already locked. Unlike RAY, which has mostly priced in its big moves since 2021, Unstaked is at the beginning, gaining attention with over $950,000 raised from new buyers. Unstaked and Raydium: A Side-by-Side Look at Potential Raydium is a DeFi/DEX token on the Solana network with uses in governance and liquidity incentives. It is live and fully operational, benefiting from high trading volumes and growing total value locked (TVL). Price forecasts suggest a moderate range of $3 to $8 in 2025, with more optimistic estimates exceeding $15. Unstaked, on the other hand, is an AI Agent Protocol that operates across multiple chains. Its token utility revolves around agent rewards and protocol governance. Although it’s currently in its presale phase, it has already raised nearly $1 million. The projected ROI from its presale price to launch is 2,700%. Its key advantage is being the first to market with functional AI agents and a built-in reward system. Raydium offers scale and liquidity in DeFi, but Unstaked presents a compelling early-stage opportunity in a rapidly emerging AI segment. Why Early AI Access Might Lead to Big Gains Unstaked isn’t here to compete with DeFi giants like Raydium. It’s here to solve a new challenge: how to automate and scale Web3 activity without hiring large teams. With mini apps like Notcoin going viral and most NFT or DeFi platforms relying on X and Telegram, Unstaked’s value is clear. It brings ready-made automation and tracks every result on-chain, offering measurable value that starts immediately after listing. The project has already raised nearly $1 million in just days, showing that buyers aren’t waiting for exchanges; they’re acting now. Raydium Is Proven, But Unstaked Could Multiply Fast Raydium remains strong in the DeFi space, and if markets stay hot, it could reach $8–$15 again with Solana’s rise. But if your goal is to find real upside from a working product, Unstaked may be the stronger play. It’s still early, but presale momentum, working tools, and token setup make it one to watch in 2025. You can still buy in during Stage 2, but once Stage 3 begins, today’s crypto presale price might be gone for good.

RCO Finance has raised over $31 million from its ongoing presale as its institutional backing continues to surge. Its user signups have also surged considerably in the past few weeks. Read on to see why experts say Dogecoin could become one of the fastest-growing tokens in the market. Dogecoin Struggles with Volatility in Early May Dogecoin holders are now in a tough position as the token struggles to maintain its recent growth. Despite a recovery in late April, Dogecoin has struggled to maintain those gains, yielding to high volatility. Market charts show that Dogeoin is now trading at $0.1731 following its 4.23% drop over the past week. In contrast, Dogecoin’s 30-day chart shows a 2.64% jump. Following Dogecoin’s volatility, some experts have shifted their stance on earlier growth predictions that said Dogecoin would return to the $0.25 mark by June. With Dogecoin struggling to maintain upward momentum, RCO Finance offers AI-powered tools that allow traders to make smarter, more informed decisions, positioning it as an alternative for those seeking a more stable and scalable option. As a result, RCO Finance is quickly gaining attention as a promising option for those seeking more stable and scalable returns. RCO Finance Surges Following Support from a Major Early ChatGPT Investor In a landscape crowded with DeFi projects promising innovation, RCO Finance emerges as a platform that not only delivers but redefines expectations.

ADA Climbs to $0.63 & PEPE Whales Accumulate,https://thecoinrise.com/web3-ai-unlocks-massive-1747-roi-potential-ada-climbs-to-0-63-pepe-whales-accumulate/,"Guesswork is being replaced by real-time analysis and smart algorithms. Many crypto platforms now include advanced tools, but only a few provide true data-backed forecasting power. Cardano (ADA) and Pepe (PEPE) are gaining traction, boosted by whale interest and social momentum. However, Web3 ai brings a deeper level of forecasting accuracy. Using technologies like GRU models, LSTM networks, and sentiment scanning, Web3 ai delivers insights that help users make decisions based on solid data rather than hype, giving it a clear predictive advantage. Cardano (ADA) Sees Continued Strength Toward $1.7 ADA recently moved up to $0.63, a 2.6% gain that points to upward momentum. Market analysts are pointing toward a $1.7 target, based on growing institutional attention and slow but steady accumulation. Technical patterns also show a rising structure, including an ascending triangle, which generally reflects strength in the trend. Should broader economic conditions hold steady, ADA’s steady fundamentals and stronger participation levels may fuel further price increases. Many observers are keeping watch on its movement toward the $1.7 barrier. Pepe (PEPE) Price Driven by Rising Whale Activity PEPE has seen a major boost in trading activity, with nearly $1.5 billion added recently. Much of this has come from large-scale buyers, often called whales, who are increasing their PEPE holdings. Such activity often hints at price growth expectations. Chart signals also point to strong momentum. The RSI has broken past 50, suggesting higher buying pressure. Also, the 30-period average closing in on the 200-period line may form the classic bullish pattern known as a golden cross. If these signals persist, analysts believe PEPE could move toward the $0.000015 to $0.000025 level in the coming months. Still, given the unpredictable nature of crypto, it’s wise to remain aware of possible swings. Web3 ai: Where Smart Crypto Forecasting Begins Entering this AI-based crypto platform’s presale gives more than just access, it unlocks tools used to read price shifts before they unfold. With systems like GRU and LSTM combined with sentiment analyzers, Web3 ai scans massive datasets to deliver sharper insights. These features provide a technical advantage for anyone aiming to make decisions with more clarity. Currently priced at $0.0003 during its crypto presale , Web3 ai is set to list at $0.005242, offering a projected 1747% ROI by the time it hits the market. This phase presents a narrow window to access AI-powered predictions before they become common in trading platforms. As more systems turn to automation and data models, early access could be the deciding factor in gaining a head start. Those seeking top crypto coins should take note, this is a path to gain early access to analytical tools that could define future trading. The window to lead before AI becomes the norm is now. Final Say! Navigating crypto trends now requires more than instinct; it calls for tools that decode signals in real-time. While Cardano and PEPE generate movement through whale signals and community buzz, Web3 ai equips users with decision-making support drawn from high-speed data scanning. The platform’s AI-based features don’t just provide entry points; they offer full-spectrum analysis. Web3 ai isn’t just about coin access, it enables clearer planning and faster response to shifts in the crypto market.

SUI is back in the spotlight as price forecasts shift upward, thanks to growing activity in DeFi and the upcoming launch of SuiPlay 0X1. Solana (SOL), on the other hand, holds its ground as a favorite for the long term, backed by rising developer interest and all-time high usage stats. Amid these shifts, BlockDAG (BDAG) is quickly becoming the talk of the presale space, offering an entry at just $0.0019 for a short time. With CEX listings now confirmed and buyers rushing to secure this rare window, BDAG’s presence is getting harder to ignore. Between gaming developments, strong price forecasts, and presale standouts, this month is packed with opportunity. SUI Price Prediction Grows with DeFi and SuiPlay Launch SUI’s price action has turned heads since it bounced back strongly from its April low. After jumping 40% from $1.93 to $3.60, experts have started lifting their year-end SUI price prediction into higher zones. The push is largely due to rising DeFi usage and the much-anticipated launch of SuiPlay 0X1, a platform focused on gaming innovation. These factors are now central to analyst models, many of which now suggest price targets between $5.05 and $6.25, depending on how fast user activity scales in the coming months. SUI’s edge may come from its unique blend of speed and gaming focus. With more staking activity and gameplay interest building up, SUI could soon challenge bigger names among Layer 1 chains. Traders now see SUI’s strategy as a possible game-winner if conditions align by late 2025. Solana Long-Term Outlook Gains Ground with Key Metrics Solana’s long-term outlook is still solid, even with short-term uncertainty on the charts. Some technical indicators show mixed results, but core fundamentals stay strong. Solana just crossed the $400 billion transaction mark, showing it’s still one of the fastest-growing networks in the space. Supporting that, DEX volume has surged 44% in just one week, and user activity keeps climbing. These metrics are reassuring for traders watching SOL hover around the $145 level. If buying pressure returns, a move toward $157 is likely the next target. Analysts say the Solana long-term outlook depends on whether its dApps can continue delivering real value. If fee generation and user growth continue to rise, Solana may stay at the top of Layer 1 rankings throughout 2025. Listings Announcement Coming as BlockDAG Draws Rush at $0.0019 Price BlockDAG (BDAG) has just confirmed plans for listings on centralized exchanges, pulling major attention toward the project. This confirmation is giving fresh confidence to early supporters, while attracting new buyers rushing to get in before the price jumps. Right now, BlockDAG is offering a limited-time entry price of $0.0019, valid only until May 13. This stands in contrast to the Batch 28 rate of $0.0262 and the planned launch price of $0.05. With over $226.5 million already raised and more than 19.7 billion coins sold, the project is seeing a strong final push in its presale phase. The numbers are hard to ignore. Early backers who bought in during Batch 1 are now looking at up to 2,520% in gains. Miner sales have crossed $6.9 million, with 17,310 units sold, proof of growing network strength and community participation. What’s driving the rush is not just pricing. It’s the momentum building around BlockDAG’s future. As the coin moves closer to public trading, this may be the final opportunity to enter before prices move to the open market. For those watching from the sidelines, time is running out to act before this rare offer closes. Wrapping Up SUI continues to rise on the back of DeFi and gaming potential, while Solana holds its lead with unmatched network stats. But all eyes are now on BlockDAG as it heads to major exchanges and offers its special presale price of $0.0019. With early buyers already seeing strong returns and excitement growing around what’s next, the current entry window is one of the last chances to join before public trading begins. For traders seeking top crypto picks this May, BlockDAG might be the opportunity they were waiting for.

While not directly tied to cryptocurrencies, significant international trade agreements, such as the recently announced US India Trade Deal , highlight the dynamic nature of global finance and political relations, factors that often influence broader market sentiment. Understanding these shifts is crucial for any informed investor, regardless of their preferred asset class. Trump Announces Landmark US India Trade Deal Former U.S. President Donald Trump recently made a significant announcement regarding trade relations between the United States and India. According to a report by Watcher Guru on X, Trump stated that India has agreed to eliminate all tariffs on American products as part of a new trade agreement. This move is reportedly aimed at fostering a more equitable and mutually beneficial trade relationship between the two major global economies. The announcement signals a potential turning point in the trade dynamics between the US and India, which have seen various periods of negotiation and disagreement over market access and tariff structures. Tariffs, essentially taxes on imported goods, can significantly impact the cost of products, affecting both producers and consumers. Their removal, as suggested by Trump, could open up new avenues for American businesses exporting to India and potentially lower costs for Indian consumers accessing US goods. What Does the Removal of India Tariffs US Goods Mean? The core of this potential agreement lies in the removal of India Tariffs US Goods . For years, tariffs have been a point of contention in US-India trade discussions. The US has often argued for greater market access in India, citing high tariffs on various American products, including agricultural goods, automobiles, and manufactured items. Eliminating these tariffs could have several implications: Increased Competitiveness: American products would become cheaper in the Indian market, making them more competitive against domestic goods and products from other countries. Boost for US Exporters: US companies exporting to India could see increased demand and profitability due to lower costs for their Indian buyers. Potential Benefits for Indian Consumers: Reduced tariffs could lead to lower prices for certain American goods in India, offering consumers more choices and potentially saving them money. Simplified Trade Process: Removing tariff barriers can simplify customs procedures and reduce administrative burdens for businesses engaged in bilateral trade. While the announcement from Trump is notable, the specifics of which tariffs would be removed, the timeline for implementation, and the scope of the agreement would be critical details that are yet to be fully disclosed or confirmed by both sides through official channels. Analyzing the Trump India Trade Perspective From the Trump India Trade perspective, this agreement aligns with his long-standing focus on renegotiating trade deals he viewed as unfavorable to the United States. Throughout his presidency, Trump prioritized reducing trade deficits and pushing partner countries to lower their barriers to American goods. His approach often involved using tariffs as leverage to encourage negotiation. This particular announcement, if it materializes into a formal agreement, could be framed as a significant achievement in securing better market terms for US businesses in a large and growing economy like India. It reflects a continuation of the ‘America First’ trade policy aimed at creating what he describes as ‘fair’ trade conditions. It’s important to note that trade negotiations are complex and often involve concessions from both sides. While the focus of the announcement is on India removing tariffs, the full scope of any potential agreement would likely involve commitments or adjustments from the US side as well. The Significance of a Bilateral Trade Agreement Formalizing a comprehensive Bilateral Trade Agreement between the US and India would be a major development. Despite being strategic partners with significant trade volumes, the two countries have not yet concluded a broad free trade agreement. Negotiations have historically faced hurdles related to market access, agricultural subsidies, intellectual property rights, and digital trade. A potential agreement focused on tariff removal could be a step towards a more integrated economic partnership. Such agreements typically aim to: Goal of Bilateral Trade Agreements Potential Impact on US-India Trade Reduce or Eliminate Tariffs & Trade Barriers Lower costs for goods, increased trade volume. Promote Investment Flows Encourage US companies to invest in India and vice versa. Harmonize Regulations & Standards Make it easier for businesses to operate in both markets. Establish Dispute Resolution Mechanisms Provide a framework for resolving trade disagreements. While Trump’s announcement specifically mentioned tariff removal, a full bilateral agreement would likely encompass a much wider range of trade and investment issues. The successful negotiation and implementation of such a deal could significantly deepen economic ties between the two nations. Examining the Potential Economic Impact The potential Economic Impact of India removing tariffs on US goods is multifaceted. For the United States, increased exports to India could support job growth in export-oriented industries and contribute positively to the trade balance. Sectors that have faced high tariffs in India, such as agriculture, manufacturing, and potentially technology, could see notable benefits. For India, while tariff removal might initially expose some domestic industries to increased competition, it could also lead to lower input costs for businesses that rely on imported American components or machinery. Furthermore, access to cheaper US goods could benefit consumers. A formal agreement could also attract more foreign direct investment from the US, bringing capital, technology, and management expertise. However, economic impacts are rarely one-sided. Domestic industries in both countries might face adjustment challenges. The overall success and impact would depend heavily on the specifics of the agreement, the sectors covered, and the pace of implementation. Global economic conditions and other geopolitical factors would also play a role in shaping the ultimate outcomes. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for US-India Trade? The announcement from Donald Trump introduces a new dimension to the ongoing conversation about US-India trade relations. While the details of this potential agreement are yet to be fully elaborated and confirmed by official sources from both governments, it highlights a continued desire from the US side to secure better trade terms with India. Key questions remain: What specific tariffs are included in this agreement? What is the proposed timeline for implementation? Are there reciprocal commitments from the US side? How will this announcement be received and potentially advanced by the current administrations in both countries? The future of US-India trade will depend on continued dialogue, negotiation, and the political will to finalize and implement agreements that are perceived as beneficial by both nations. Such developments in international trade policy are worth monitoring, not just for those directly involved in import/export, but also for anyone interested in the broader economic trends that influence global markets, including the increasingly interconnected world of digital assets. Conclusion: A Step Towards Stronger Economic Ties? Donald Trump’s announcement regarding India’s agreement to remove tariffs on US goods marks a potentially significant step in strengthening US India Trade Deal dynamics. If realized, the removal of India Tariffs US Goods could offer tangible benefits for American exporters and potentially Indian consumers, driving a positive Economic Impact . This development underscores the ongoing efforts to shape the Bilateral Trade Agreement landscape between these two major economies. While details are awaited, the prospect of improved trade terms reflects a continued focus on fostering a more balanced relationship, aligning with the principles often emphasized in Trump India Trade discussions.

Bittensor (TAO), one of the most discussed names, saw a parabolic rally driven by speculation around decentralized machine learning. At one point, social feeds were buzzing with TAO price updates, and many who caught the early wave witnessed serious gains. But now, momentum is slipping. Trading volumes are thinning out, growth is tapering off, and fresh capital is turning its head elsewhere. With altcoins rotating out and newer narratives dominating headlines, presales are regaining serious traction. One project rising quickly through the ranks is Qubetics ($TICS), a utility-based token currently in Stage 33 of its crypto presale . Its unique combination of cross-border functionality, a developer IDE, and real-world payment integration has many analysts already dubbing it the Top Altcoin for Massive Return Potential in 2025. Bittensor’s Peak Was a Lesson in Timing When Bittensor first dropped, few expected it to grow from a niche AI play to one of the most talked-about assets in the Layer-1 space. Built on a decentralized intelligence economy model, TAO’s architecture was designed to incentivize knowledge-sharing neural networks. For a moment, it appeared as though it would redefine how data is monetized. But like many breakout cryptos, Bittensor’s gains were largely reserved for those who entered early. Its low-circulating supply model added rocket fuel to its initial surge, pushing its valuation beyond expectations. However, as AI hype simmered down and regulatory concerns over training models increased, TAO faced the natural slowdown that comes when exponential growth collides with market reality. TAO’s price appreciation provided early believers with financial windfalls, but today’s entry points offer far less upside. The asset has matured—and so has its risk profile. Meanwhile, presale-stage projects like Qubetics are drawing attention from traders seeking steep ROI potential rather than incremental gains. Qubetics ($TICS) Has Entered the Chat — With Real-World Solutions Qubetics isn’t selling hype—it’s delivering use cases. The token supports a fully integrated Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet, complete with user-defined security layers, seamless token swaps, and staking support. But what truly separates it from typical presale tokens is its real-world application engine. $TICS isn’t just a store of value—it’s a tool for solving everyday payment and development challenges. From logistics firms needing fast, low-cost cross-border settlements to freelancers handling recurring international payments, Qubetics is offering a blockchain solution that works outside the speculative loop. And that’s rare in crypto presale environments. Here are the updated presale details: Stage: 33rd Current Price: $0.2302 Tokens Sold: 511 million Total Raised: $16.7 million Holders: Over 25,800 The current entry point still offers exposure to massive upside. If $TICS reaches $1 post-presale, the return is 334%. At $5, that ROI spikes to 2071%. Analysts forecasting a mainnet valuation of $10–$15 have outlined returns as high as 6414%, making it the definitive Top Altcoin for Massive Return Potential this cycle. Real-Life Use Cases That Don’t Sound Like Sci-Fi Unlike coins that pitch vague Web3 dreams, Qubetics has built a practical stack. Its ecosystem includes tools developers can use now—like QubeQode, a smart contract IDE that accelerates build times without requiring Solidity mastery. Then there’s the Qubetics Wallet, which connects directly to real-world payment rails and lets users pay in crypto but settle in local currencies across 100+ countries. Think of a small apparel manufacturer in the Philippines sourcing materials from Vietnam, shipping to Australia, and selling to Canada. With Qubetics, payments, settlements, and currency swaps happen in one tap—without going through costly third-party processors or enduring multi-day delays. Even freelancers and digital creators now have a way to receive crypto payments, convert them instantly, and stake idle funds while they wait for client confirmations. Qubetics removes friction, and that’s what real-world adoption looks like. Because of this, experts now classify $TICS not just as a utility token, but as a Top Altcoin for Massive Return Potential thanks to its long-term relevance outside the speculation bubble. Why Timing Qubetics Is Like Catching Bitcoin Under $10 Presale coins that survive beyond hype cycles often deliver the largest returns in crypto history. Bitcoin did it. Ethereum did it. And now, analysts are saying Qubetics is built to follow suit—not just because of timing, but because of fundamentals. The current crypto presale price of $0.2302 is still considered an entry window with explosive upside. As market attention shifts from overbought assets like Bittensor to underpriced utility tokens, $TICS could become the next breakout chart everyone’s talking about. Unlike meme coins that rely on viral trends, Qubetics is backed by an ecosystem that’s already solving problems for thousands globally. And that’s the real takeaway here—while Bittensor marked a powerful moment in AI token history, Qubetics is shaping up to define a new era in cross-border blockchain adoption. Final Verdict: Top Altcoin for Massive Return Potential Bittensor was the prototype for decentralized AI. It paved the way, built excitement, and rewarded early entries—but it also capped out quickly for anyone late to the party. Now, attention is turning toward tokens that are early in their lifecycle, backed by real-world use cases, and capable of scaling beyond just crypto headlines. Qubetics checks every one of those boxes. With crypto presale momentum, affordable access, and projected post-mainnet prices as high as $15, it’s no longer a hidden gem. It’s the Top Altcoin for Massive Return Potential , and entry windows are closing fast.

44259252,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157801,1746584435,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,AI in Biology: FutureHouse Unveils Promising Tool for Scientific Discovery,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/futurehouse-ai-biology-tool/,"In the rapidly evolving world of technology and science, artificial intelligence continues to push boundaries. FutureHouse, a non-profit organization supported by Eric Schmidt, is making strides in applying AI to complex fields like biology. Their ambitious goal is to develop an “AI scientist” capable of automating significant parts of the research process within the next decade. Recently, FutureHouse provided a preview of their new AI in biology tool, Finch, designed to support “data-driven discovery.” Understanding the FutureHouse AI Research Tool: Finch Finch is positioned as a powerful new AI research tool aimed at accelerating biological discovery. It operates by processing large volumes of biological data, primarily from research papers. Users provide a prompt, such as querying molecular drivers of diseases, and Finch then executes code, generates visual figures, and analyzes the results. FutureHouse co-founder and CEO Sam Rodriques likened its current capabilities to those of a “first-year grad student.” Data Input: Primarily research papers and other biological datasets. Process: Takes prompts, runs code, generates figures, inspects results. Capabilities: Supports open-ended analysis and directed tasks like differential expression analysis. Speed: Capable of performing complex analyses in minutes. Rodriques highlighted the speed aspect, noting that being able to perform these tasks in minutes is a “superpower.” He also mentioned that Finch has already helped FutureHouse’s internal projects uncover “really cool stuff.” The Promise of AI for Scientific Discovery FutureHouse’s initiative aligns with a broader vision shared by many tech leaders: that AI will fundamentally transform the scientific process. The potential for scientific discovery to be massively accelerated by advanced AI tools is a compelling prospect. Leaders like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei have articulated bold predictions, suggesting AI could speed up breakthroughs, potentially even aiding in finding cures for major diseases like cancer. The field of AI drug discovery is particularly attractive, with market estimates pointing to significant growth. Precedence Research projected the market value at $65.88 billion in 2024, potentially reaching $160.31 billion by 2034. This growth potential underscores the intense interest and investment flowing into this sector. Navigating Challenges in AI Drug Discovery Despite the optimism and market potential, the path for AI drug discovery is not without hurdles. The article notes that evidence of AI leading to major, novel scientific breakthroughs is still limited. Many researchers remain cautious about the current utility of AI in guiding the core scientific process. Real-world applications have faced difficulties. Several companies leveraging AI for drug discovery, such as Exscientia and BenevolentAI, have experienced high-profile clinical trial failures. Furthermore, the accuracy of even leading AI systems, like Google DeepMind’s AlphaFold 3 for protein structure prediction, can vary. Finch itself, while promising, is not immune to errors. Rodriques admitted that the tool currently makes “silly mistakes.” To address this, FutureHouse is actively recruiting bioinformaticians and computational biologists. Their role will be crucial in evaluating Finch’s accuracy and reliability during its closed beta phase, helping to train the tool and improve its performance. FutureHouse AI: Beta Program and Next Steps FutureHouse’s decision to launch Finch in a closed beta and involve domain experts highlights a pragmatic approach to development. By collaborating with bioinformaticians and computational biologists, they aim to refine the tool’s capabilities and build confidence in its outputs before a wider release. This feedback loop is essential for developing a reliable AI research tool that can genuinely assist in complex biological investigations. While the vision of a fully autonomous “AI scientist” is still some time away, tools like Finch represent tangible steps towards augmenting human researchers’ abilities. The ability to quickly process vast datasets and identify potential areas of interest could significantly reduce the time spent on initial analysis, freeing up scientists to focus on experimental validation and deeper investigation. Conclusion: A Step Forward for AI in Biology FutureHouse’s preview of Finch marks an important development in the application of AI to scientific research. While the tool is still in development and faces challenges common to early-stage AI systems, its potential to accelerate data analysis in biology is clear. The success of Finch and similar tools will depend on continued development, rigorous validation, and effective integration into existing research workflows. As the field progresses, AI is set to play an increasingly vital role in driving future scientific discovery , potentially unlocking new insights into biology and health.

The Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement Act, or the MEME Act, aims to prevent federal officials from using their position to profit from memecoins , Democrat Senator Chris Murphy said in a May 6 statement. If passed, the MEME Act prohibits the president, vice president, members of Congress, senior executive branch officials, their spouses and children from issuing, sponsoring, or promoting a security, future, commodity, or digital asset, according to the bill’s description. Today I’m introducing a bill - the MEME Act - to ban a President or Member of Congress from issuing a meme coin.

US Representative Sam Liccardo, another Democrat, introduced companion legislation in the House of Representatives. However, Trump’s party, the Republicans, controls both chambers, and the legislation will need Republican support. Meanwhile, Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, a ranking member of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI), said in a May 6 statement that the committee is opening a preliminary inquiry into the Official Trump (TRUMP) token, Trump-backed platform World Liberty Financial (WLFI), and other associated business ventures. As part of the inquiry, the PSI sent letters to the company behind the Trump coin, Fight Fight Fight, and WLFI, asking for records and communications between the companies and the Trump organization.

Main points of interest flagged by the PSI include fees the president is making on the TRUMP token and the nearly 50% spike in value from $9.40 to $13.65 after the TRUMP coin website announced on April 23 that the top 220 holders of the token would be invited to a gala dinner at the White House. Soon after launch on Jan. 18 , the Trump coin hit its all-time high of $73.43, according to CoinGecko. However, it has since lost 85% of its value and is trading for $11.13. More than half of TRUMP holders in profit Roughly two million wallets have bought TRUMP, with an extra 54,000 adding the token to their stash after the dinner announcement, according to data shared with Cointelegraph from blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis. Around 764,000 of these, most with small holdings, lost money on the coin, while the 58 investors in the token have made profits of over $10 million each, totaling an estimated $1.1 billion. At the same time, Chainalysis says the memecoin creator has made $320 million so far, with an extra $1.3 million coming in since the White House dinner announcement.

The belief appears to come from an unverified private letter supposedly sent by Yu to a Zerebro investor, trading activity linked to crypto wallets owned by Yu, and the removal of his obituary from Legacy.com. Others speculate that Yu used a tool to pass off a pre-edited video as if it were filmed in real-time during the Pump.fun livestream. Source: Hash The unverified letter from Yu to an early investor states that he deliberately created a livestream pretending to shoot himself as it was the only “viable exit” from persistent harassment, blackmail, threats and hate crimes. “Being fully doxxed has placed me under constant fear of robbery and physical harm. There have been numerous notable figures in the crypto community which have undergone armed robberies in their homes recently.” “With my address publicly known, I have not been able to comfortably reside in any of my family’s homes for months now.” The letter claimed he would “exit public life and fame” and shift his focus to music, conducted in anonymity. In addition to the unverified letter, Legacy.com removed Yu’s obituary, which initially described him as a Stanford “tech prodigy” who scaled the AI content-powered Zerebro protocol into an $800 million ecosystem at its peak. Source: Vee X user and crypto enthusiast “Vee” also claimed that after Yu’s supposed death, one of his wallets offloaded the Zerebro (ZEREBRO) token for USDC ( USDC ), which was then moved to the same address that created the Legacoin (LLJEFFY) token. Vee’s claims were later supported by blockchain analytics firm Bubblemaps, which estimated that $100,000 of ZEREBRO was sold and moved to LLJEFFY.

But many experts and analysts believe that goal is unlikely — at least in the short term. To reach $100, XRP’s market value would need to rise to around trillions, more than triple the current size of Bitcoin’s market cap. While XRP is aiming to disrupt massive industries like global payments, tokenized real-world assets, and carbon credits — which together are worth hundreds of trillions — such a price jump is still a long shot for now. The truth is, XRP is making progress and has real-world utility, especially in international payments. But major adoption takes time, especially when working with banks and institutions that move slowly and are still benefiting from traditional systems like SWIFT. That’s why many are urging the XRP community to manage expectations. Altcoin Bale said that while a $100 target may sound exciting, it’s more realistic to prepare for XRP to reach around $20 in the near term. Hitting that level would still represent a strong return from current prices. XRP Price Prediction (Short Term) XRP is currently trading within a falling channel pattern on the weekly chart, a setup that often signals long-term accumulation. Despite the downward trend, analysts suggest the price may be approaching a key support zone that could lead to a reversal. According to the latest analysis, the $1.85 level is seen as a strong support area. $XRP /USDT Weekly Analysis #XRP Price is still moving inside a falling channel with clear accumulation behavior.

The worlds of high fashion, cutting-edge blockchain technology, and immersive gaming are colliding in an exciting new way. Major brands continue to explore the potential of Web3, and Adidas is stepping back into the spotlight with a significant move in the realm of crypto gaming . This time, they’re setting their sights on the Sui Blockchain , partnering with the upcoming third-person shooter RPG, Xociety, for an exclusive NFT Drop . What Are These Exclusive Adidas NFTs All About? Adidas has announced the launch of 2,600 unique mystery box NFTs designed specifically for the anticipated Xociety Game . These aren’t just digital collectibles; they offer tangible utility within the game world, primarily providing exclusive in-game skins featuring iconic Adidas-branded apparel. Imagine decking out your character in virtual Adidas gear as you navigate the futuristic landscapes of Xociety! This initiative builds upon Adidas’s previous successful forays into the Web3 space, demonstrating a continued commitment to exploring digital ownership and community engagement through NFTs. Partnering with a game like Xociety allows Adidas to connect with a new demographic and integrate its brand directly into interactive digital experiences. The NFT Drop Details: Where and When? Mark your calendars! The minting of these highly anticipated Adidas NFTs is scheduled for May 16th. The chosen platform for this exclusive event is Tradeport, a prominent marketplace within the Sui Blockchain ecosystem. This strategic choice highlights the growing importance of Sui as a platform for large-scale brand activations and digital asset launches. Here’s a quick breakdown of what to expect from the drop: Total Supply: 2,600 Mystery Box NFTs Blockchain: Sui Minting Platform: Tradeport Mint Date: May 16th Utility: In-game skins for Xociety featuring Adidas branding Rarity Tiers: Four distinct tiers, suggesting different levels of exclusivity or visual variations for the in-game items. The mystery box format adds an element of surprise and excitement, common in NFT drops and gaming loot boxes, encouraging participation and speculation on which rarity tier players might receive. Why Sui Blockchain ? Adidas’s decision to launch on Sui is noteworthy. While many initial brand NFT projects gravitated towards established chains like Ethereum or Polygon, Sui represents a newer generation of blockchain technology known for its high throughput, low transaction costs, and developer-friendly environment, particularly suited for gaming and high-volume transactions. This could signal growing confidence in Sui’s infrastructure and its potential to support scalable Web3 gaming experiences like Xociety. Sui’s object-centric model is designed to handle parallel processing, making it potentially more efficient for managing dynamic in-game assets and complex interactions compared to account-centric models. This technical advantage could be a key factor in supporting a smooth experience for Xociety players using their Adidas NFT skins. How Does This Connect to the Xociety Game ? Xociety is shaping up to be an intriguing addition to the crypto gaming landscape. As a third-person shooter RPG, it aims to blend action-packed gameplay with role-playing elements and, crucially, Web3 mechanics. The partnership with Adidas provides significant mainstream brand validation for Xociety even before its full launch. The integration of Adidas NFT skins means players who own these digital assets will have a unique way to customize their in-game appearance, potentially offering bragging rights or visual distinction within the game world. This kind of exclusive, branded content can be a powerful driver for both NFT adoption and game engagement. Beyond Skins: The Revenue-Sharing Model One of the most compelling aspects of this collaboration, as reported by Blockworks, is the inclusion of a revenue-sharing deal. While specific details of the model are often complex and depend on the agreement between Adidas, Xociety, and potentially the NFT holders, this suggests that owning these Adidas NFTs could offer more than just cosmetic benefits. Revenue sharing in Web3 gaming can take various forms, such as a portion of in-game transaction fees, marketplace royalties, or other income streams distributed among NFT holders. This model aligns with the Web3 ethos of rewarding players and early supporters, turning passive consumers into active stakeholders with a vested interest in the game’s success. It adds a layer of potential financial benefit on top of the in-game utility, making the NFT Drop even more attractive. Actionable Insights: Getting Involved If you’re interested in potentially acquiring one of these exclusive Adidas NFTs for the Xociety Game , here’s what you should consider: Research Xociety: Understand the game itself. Is it a game you’re genuinely interested in playing? The primary utility of the NFT is tied to the game. Prepare for the Sui Blockchain: Ensure you have a compatible wallet that supports Sui and have some SUI tokens ready for potential minting costs or marketplace purchases. Monitor Tradeport: Keep an eye on the Tradeport platform as the May 16th date approaches for specific minting mechanics, pricing, and any eligibility requirements. Understand the Rarity Tiers: While details are scarce, be aware that there are four tiers, likely impacting the visual design or perceived value of the in-game skin you receive. Assess the Revenue Sharing: Try to find more detailed information about the revenue-sharing model closer to the mint date to understand the potential long-term benefits of holding the NFT. As with any NFT investment or participation in crypto gaming projects, it’s crucial to do your own thorough research (DYOR) and understand the risks involved. Benefits and Challenges This collaboration presents several potential benefits: For Adidas: Deeper engagement with the gaming and Web3 communities, exploring new revenue streams, staying at the forefront of digital innovation. For Xociety: Significant brand visibility and legitimacy boost, attracting a wider audience beyond typical crypto users, exclusive content offering for players. For Sui: Validation as a capable platform for major brand partnerships and gaming applications, increased transaction volume and user activity. For Players/NFT Holders: Exclusive in-game cosmetic items, potential participation in revenue sharing, ownership of a unique digital asset from a major brand. However, challenges exist: Market Adoption: Will mainstream gamers embrace the Web3 elements and NFTs? Execution Risk: The success relies on both the quality of the Xociety game and the smooth implementation of the NFT utility and revenue sharing. NFT Market Volatility: The value of the NFTs on the secondary market can be highly unpredictable. Technical Hurdles: Ensuring a seamless user experience for acquiring and using NFTs within the game. The Growing Trend of Brands in Crypto Gaming Adidas is not the first major brand to venture into crypto gaming or utilize NFTs, but this specific collaboration highlights a maturing trend. We’ve seen various levels of engagement, from simple collectible drops to more integrated experiences. This partnership with Xociety and the focus on in-game utility and revenue sharing represent a deeper integration than many earlier brand NFT projects. This trend is significant because it brings mainstream attention and potentially millions of new users into the Web3 space. As more reputable brands and high-quality games enter this arena, the perceived legitimacy and potential for mass adoption of blockchain technology and NFTs grow. Conclusion: A Glimpse into the Future of Digital Assets The upcoming launch of 2,600 exclusive Adidas NFTs on the Sui Blockchain for the Xociety Game is more than just another NFT Drop ; it’s a clear indicator of the evolving relationship between major global brands, blockchain technology, and the interactive world of video games. By offering in-game utility and a potential revenue-sharing model, Adidas and Xociety are attempting to create a more compelling value proposition for digital ownership. This collaboration leverages the unique capabilities of the Sui Blockchain and positions Xociety as a game to watch in the competitive crypto gaming sector. While challenges remain for widespread adoption, initiatives like this pave the way for a future where digital assets from our favorite brands are seamlessly integrated into the virtual worlds we inhabit, offering both cosmetic appeal and potential economic benefits.

The Federal Reserve, under Chair Jerome Powell, is all but certain to keep the fed‑funds corridor at 4.25 to 4.50 percent; CME Group’s FedWatch tool assigns a 98.2 percent probability to an unchanged stance. That near‑certainty, however, has not muffled political noise. President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent have publicly pressed for lower borrowing costs, yet Powell’s most recent public remarks on 16 April framed monetary policy as “in a wait‑and‑see mode,” adding that the labor market “is in decent shape” but that the Fed’s “obligation is to keep longer‑term inflation expectations well anchored and to make certain that a one‑time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem.” In effect, the central bank continues to prioritize price stability even as leading indicators imply a cooling economy and a likely pivot to easing in the second half of the year. FOMC Preview For Bitcoin For Bitcoin, the debate is less about whether the Fed blinks tomorrow and more about how algorithmic liquidity and discretionary positioning react to the tone of Powell’s press conference. Crypto trader Josh Rager told his followers on X, “Expect chop chop until FOMC tomorrow. Then after the rate cut announcement, expect volatility. With a reversal during Powell’s speech. That’s my FOMC playbook at the moment.” Although Rager’s baseline presumes an eventual reduction in rates, his near‑term focus is the intraday whipsaw that typically frames the statement‑and‑Q&A window. Related Reading: Strategy Expands Bitcoin Investments With Latest Purchase, Now Holding 555,450 BTC In Total Astronomer (@astronomer_zero) offered a more probabilistic roadmap, emphasizing that his trademarked FOMC‑reversal model has “consistently provided reversals with an over 85 percent chance. If the mechanics continue to play out for this month, that would mean we would (have) top(ped) out this or last week before a significant move down.” Yet he tempers that historical edge by noting that the prevailing quarterly uptrend in Bitcoin could blunt the signal: “That would mean that this and/or next FOMC meeting both have a weakened reversal effect in the midst of what I expect to be a strong uptrend.” In practical terms, he foresees: “I think the most likely scenario (76% chance) is a move up from here and the FOMC reversal gets completely ignored. The smaller chance (24%) is indeed a rather shallow pullback within our stoploss area.” Related Reading: LMACD Indicator Reveals Where The Bitcoin Price Is After Rejection From $97,000 Columbus (@columbus0x) looks to the microstructure for confirmation. Citing a Hyblock heat‑map of liquidations, he expects “a wick below into the box… below the equal lows and also exactly the area that Hyblock has highlighted as a yellow zone,” a region that coincides with the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement from the last significant swing low. Should Powell strike a hawkish tone, Columbus anticipates “a deviation below the range low / a retest of the 200‑day SMA, closing the CME gap between $91.8 and$92.4 k – or possibly even dipping into the high $80’s. Nonetheless: trend is up.” Momentum diagnostics add a final layer. Titan of Crypto observes that Bitcoin “is consolidating between last week’s high and low, awaiting tomorrow’s FOMC meeting and Jerome Powell’s speech. Meanwhile, the daily MACD is crossing bearish, signaling slowing momentum.” A confirmed rollover in the histogram would align with the shallow‑pullback scenario outlined by Astronomer and Columbus, yet the consolidation itself keeps higher‑time‑frame trend traders constructive Taken together, tomorrow’s decision appears binary only on the surface; the real determinant is Powell’s forward‑guidance language and its impact on terminal‑rate pricing. If the Chair stresses patience while acknowledging softer data, the curve could begin to discount a June cut, providing a macro tailwind that validates the bulls’ quarterly thesis. Conversely, any hint of renewed vigilance on inflation would embolden short‑term bears hunting liquidity below $92 k. Either way, the tape has little room for complacency: liquidity is thin, options gamma is clustered around the psychologically resonant $100,000 strike, and the narrative energy surrounding a second‑half‑of‑2025 easing cycle is colliding head‑on with the Fed’s near‑term inflation mandate. At press time, BTC traded at $94,097.

The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) has made a significant move by withdrawing its appeal against prediction market platform Kalshi. This decision is a game-changer, effectively clearing a major hurdle and allowing Kalshi to proceed with offering contracts based on political events. If you’re following the intersection of digital platforms, finance, and regulation, this development is definitely worth your attention. What Led to the CFTC and Kalshi Showdown? The story began when Kalshi, a regulated prediction market exchange, sought approval from the CFTC to list contracts related to political outcomes. Think questions like “Will Party A win the popular vote in State B?” or “Will Candidate C be elected?” Kalshi’s argument is that these contracts function as economic hedges or forecasts, providing valuable information and trading opportunities, similar to how markets predict interest rate changes or commodity prices. However, the CFTC initially rejected these proposals, citing concerns that such contracts could be deemed “contrary to the public interest” or constitute illegal gambling under existing interpretations of commodity law. This rejection wasn’t accepted quietly by Kalshi. Believing their proposed markets were legitimate and fell within the regulatory framework for derivatives, Kalshi took the bold step of suing the commission in 2023. The lawsuit challenged the CFTC’s rejection, arguing it was arbitrary and capricious. Kalshi maintained that their platform provided a structured, regulated environment for predicting future events, distinct from traditional betting or gambling. This legal battle put a spotlight on the evolving nature of prediction markets and how they fit into established financial regulations in the United States. The Significance of the CFTC’s Withdrawal Fast forward to today, the CFTC has withdrawn its appeal against Kalshi. According to reports, both parties agreed to drop the case and cover their own legal costs. This withdrawal isn’t just a procedural step; it marks a substantial victory for Kalshi and the broader prediction markets industry. Here’s why this is a big deal: Path Cleared for Political Betting: The immediate effect is that Kalshi is now free to pursue offering contracts on political events, which was the core issue of the lawsuit. This opens up a new category of markets for their users. Regulatory Signal: The withdrawal, especially under the leadership of Acting Chair Caroline Pham, suggests a potential shift or at least a nuanced approach within the CFTC towards prediction markets. It signals a possible willingness to reconsider or allow certain types of event contracts that were previously viewed with skepticism. Precedent Setting: While not a court ruling on the merits, the CFTC backing down in the face of a legal challenge from a regulated entity like Kalshi could set a precedent or at least embolden other platforms or exchanges looking to list similar event contracts. Validation for Kalshi: For Kalshi, this is a major vindication of their legal challenge and their business model. They stood up to the regulator and achieved their goal of getting the initial rejection overturned implicitly through the withdrawal. What Does This Mean for Political Betting and Prediction Markets? The CFTC’s decision has direct implications for the landscape of political betting and prediction markets in the US . Until now, participating in prediction markets related to politics for US residents often involved using offshore platforms, which come with significant risks, including lack of regulation and potential for fraud. Kalshi, being a regulated US entity, offers a different environment. Here’s a look at the potential impacts: Increased Accessibility: Regulated platforms can potentially attract a wider range of users who might be hesitant to use unregulated offshore sites. Enhanced Transparency and Security: Operating under CFTC oversight means adherence to rules regarding market integrity, customer protection, and financial stability, offering users more confidence. More Accurate Forecasting? Proponents argue that liquid prediction markets can aggregate dispersed information and provide more accurate forecasts than traditional polling or expert opinions. Allowing more topics, like politics, could test this hypothesis further. Innovation in Event Contracts: This could pave the way for other types of event contracts on regulated platforms, expanding the scope of what can be traded beyond traditional financial assets. However, challenges remain. The line between a legitimate prediction market contract and illegal gambling can still be blurry in practice and subject to interpretation. Public perception and ethical considerations around betting on sensitive political events will also continue to be discussed. The Regulatory Environment: A New Approach? The timing of the withdrawal, occurring under Acting Chair Caroline Pham, suggests it aligns with her stated approach to regulation. While the article source mentions her leadership in the dismissal, understanding her broader perspective is key. Generally, there’s been a growing conversation within regulatory bodies about how to handle novel financial products and technologies, including those related to crypto and event markets. This specific outcome might indicate a willingness within the CFTC to: Engage with regulated entities bringing forward innovative proposals. Perhaps favor allowing markets unless there’s a clear and compelling reason based on market integrity or public interest concerns, rather than a blanket prohibition. Address regulatory questions through dialogue or reconsiderations, potentially avoiding protracted legal battles where possible. This doesn’t mean the door is wide open for everything. Regulatory bodies like the CFTC still have the mandate to protect market integrity and the public. But the Kalshi outcome suggests that regulated platforms proposing well-structured event contracts might find a more receptive audience or at least a fairer fight than before. What Does This Mean for Users and the Market? For individuals interested in participating in prediction markets , this development means more options may become available on regulated US platforms. It’s crucial, however, to understand exactly what you are trading. These are complex instruments, and like any market, they involve risk. Actionable Insights: Do Your Research: Understand how prediction markets work, the specific contracts offered, and the potential outcomes. Understand the Risks: You can lose the money you put into these contracts. Treat them as speculative investments, not guaranteed returns. Use Regulated Platforms: The advantage of platforms like Kalshi is regulatory oversight, offering protections not found on unregulated sites. Stay Informed: The regulatory landscape for prediction markets and crypto-related financial products is still evolving. Keep up with announcements from the CFTC and other bodies. The ability for a regulated platform to offer political betting contracts could also influence other market participants. We might see other regulated exchanges explore similar offerings, potentially leading to more diverse and liquid markets for event-based predictions. Looking Ahead: The Future of Prediction Markets in the US The CFTC ‘s withdrawal in the Kalshi case is a landmark moment for prediction markets in the US . It signals a potential thawing in the regulatory stance towards certain types of event contracts, particularly those on regulated platforms. While challenges and debates about the nature and appropriateness of certain contracts will undoubtedly continue, this decision provides a significant boost to the industry’s hopes for expansion within the regulated framework. The focus will now shift to how platforms like Kalshi implement these new offerings and how the CFTC continues to oversee this evolving market segment. It’s a dynamic space, and this development has just added a fascinating new chapter to its story.

The upcoming Federal Reserve decision on May 7 could influence Bitcoin’s price movement over the coming days. Bitcoin needs to continue to hold above the $95,000 level for a chance to climb back and retest its all-time high, or face an even deeper correction, crypto analysts say. It comes after several analysts told Cointelegraph earlier this year that June could be the month Bitcoin ( BTC ) reaches new all-time highs. “The $95,000 level — currently under consolidation — is a critical pivot point, acting as the lower boundary of a three-month range that defined market structure between November 2024 and February 2025,” Bitfinex said in a May 6 markets report. Bitcoin holding above $95K would signal a “structural shift” Bitfinex said that Bitcoin holding above the $95,000 level would signal a “structural shift” back into bullish territory, with a potential upward trend toward retesting its all-time highs. Bitcoin reached its $109,000 all-time high on Jan. 20, just hours before US President Donald Trump’s inauguration. At the time of publication, Bitcoin is trading at $96,730, up 3.03% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. However, Bitfinex analysts said if Bitcoin fails to hold above $95,000, it could be headed for further downfall. “Failure to hold, however, could turn the region into resistance once more, raising the risk of a short-term rejection and another leg of corrective price action.” They said the next several days will determine whether Bitcoin will be heading “into a sustained breakout or resolves into a retest of lower support zones.” Bitcoin is up 2% over the past seven days. Source: CoinMarketCap However, if Bitcoin continues the rally, it may catch many traders offside. Crypto analyst Thomas Fahrer said in a May 7 X post that $400 million of Bitcoin short positions are at risk of liquidation at the $98,000 price level. “Send it,” Fahrer said. Bitcoin is approaching the timeframe many analysts predicted for new highs earlier this year. On March 28, Real Vision chief crypto analyst Jamie Coutts projected a best-case target of $123,000 by June . Related: Bitcoin price rallied 1,550% the last time the ‘BTC risk-off’ metric fell this low Around the same time, Swan Bitcoin CEO Cory Klippsten said that Bitcoin has a “50% chance” of reaching new all-time highs before the end of June . Since 2013, Bitcoin’s average performance in June has been slightly negative at -0.35%. The upcoming Federal Reserve interest rate decision on May 7 could also have an impact on Bitcoin’s price. The announcement often sees crypto market volatility both before and after the results are published. However, the latest data from CME Group’s FedWatch Tool indicates that the futures market sees minimal odds of a rate cut . Meanwhile, overall market sentiment is becoming more positive as Bitcoin’s price approaches the psychological $100,000 price level. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , which measures overall market sentiment, has spiked again over the past 24 hours, further into “Greed” territory, jumping 8 points to a score of 67.

For major players like Tether , the issuer of the largest stablecoin, USDT, staying ahead of the curve is paramount. This is particularly true as the industry looks towards bridging the gap between traditional finance and digital assets, notably through RWA tokenization . A significant step in this direction has just been announced: Tether has integrated Chainalysis’ advanced compliance and monitoring tools directly into its Hadron platform. What Does This Tether and Chainalysis Integration Mean? This integration isn’t just a minor update; it’s a strategic move designed to bake institutional-grade oversight directly into the infrastructure of Hadron, Tether’s platform dedicated to tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs). By bringing Chainalysis’ capabilities onboard, Tether is significantly enhancing its ability to manage risk and ensure regulatory adherence across its operations, particularly as it expands into the complex realm of tokenized assets beyond its core Stablecoin business. The integration provides several key benefits: Enhanced Risk Detection: Proactively identifying potential illicit activity or high-risk transactions. Real-Time Transaction Monitoring: Keeping a constant watch on transaction flows to spot suspicious patterns as they happen. Know Your Transaction (KYT) Support: Gaining deeper insights into the nature and parties involved in transactions. These tools are fundamental for any entity handling significant volumes of digital assets, but they become even more critical when dealing with the regulatory complexities associated with RWAs. Why is Crypto Compliance Crucial for Stablecoins and RWA Tokenization? As the crypto market matures, regulators worldwide are increasing their scrutiny. Stablecoin issuers, in particular, face intense pressure due to their potential role in the global financial system. Ensuring robust Crypto Compliance isn’t just good practice; it’s becoming a regulatory necessity for long-term viability and broader adoption. For RWA Tokenization , compliance is perhaps even more critical. Tokenizing assets like real estate, stocks, or commodities brings traditional financial regulations into the digital asset space. Investors, especially institutional ones, demand assurances that the digital representation of their assets is handled with the same level of oversight and security as traditional financial instruments. Compliance tools like those offered by Chainalysis provide the necessary infrastructure to meet these stringent requirements. Boosting Trust and Adoption Through Enhanced Stablecoin Oversight The move to integrate Chainalysis directly into Hadron signals Tether ‘s commitment to transparency and security. For a Stablecoin issuer handling billions in value daily, demonstrating proactive efforts in Crypto Compliance is vital for maintaining trust among users, partners, and regulators. This enhanced oversight is particularly appealing to institutional investors and traditional financial firms considering entering the digital asset space via stablecoins or tokenized RWAs. Think of it this way: institutional players operate within highly regulated environments. They need confidence that the digital assets they interact with meet similar standards. By implementing sophisticated monitoring and compliance tools, Tether makes its platforms, including Hadron for RWA Tokenization , more attractive and accessible to this crucial segment of the market, potentially unlocking significant liquidity and growth. Navigating the Future of RWA Tokenization with Robust Crypto Compliance The Hadron platform is designed to be a gateway for bringing real-world assets onto the blockchain. This involves complex processes, including legal structuring, valuation, and ongoing management. Layering strong Crypto Compliance tools from Chainalysis onto this platform from the outset ensures that the RWA tokens issued via Hadron can meet global regulatory standards from day one. This proactive approach can help Tether and its partners navigate the often-uncertain regulatory landscape surrounding tokenized assets. It positions Hadron not just as a technical platform for tokenization but as a compliant infrastructure capable of handling regulated assets. This could accelerate the adoption of RWA Tokenization by providing a trusted and secure environment for issuers and investors alike. Conclusion: A Strategic Leap for Tether and the RWA Space Tether ‘s integration of Chainalysis into its Hadron platform is a significant development. It underscores the growing importance of robust Crypto Compliance in the digital asset ecosystem, particularly for major stablecoin issuers and platforms focused on RWA Tokenization . This move enhances security, transparency, and regulatory adherence, paving the way for greater institutional participation and solidifying Tether ‘s position as a leader navigating the future of finance. It’s a clear signal that compliance is not an afterthought but a core component of building scalable and trusted digital asset infrastructure.

But a new DeFi powerhouse with 122,000 daily users and a Binance listing in view is igniting investor frenzy. With a rapidly expanding user base and whispers of a major exchange listing, the crypto community is asking: Could this be 2025’s breakout digital asset? Dogecoin’s Meme Magic Loses Steam As of now, Dogecoin (DOGE) stands at $0.1708 with a substantial market cap of $25.48 billion. Despite its enduring popularity, a closer look reveals cracks in its momentum. A 3.3% daily price decline pairs with a dramatic 33.5% plunge in trading volume to $668 million, raising red flags about fading retail interest. Dogecoin’s (DOGE) supply is uncapped, inherently limiting its long-term price growth. Analysts from CoinDCX place its Q3 2025 price target at $0.55 , suggesting modest returns at best. While Dogecoin’s (DOGE) community remains loyal, a new contender, a DeFi juggernaut backed by institutional clout, is rapidly gaining momentum and challenging the status quo. RCO Finance, with its cutting-edge AI-driven features and clear road to major exchange listings, has the potential to achieve Dogecoin’s transformational ambition. RCOF’s $31M Presale Draws Tech Titans RCO Finance (RCOF) has already raised $31 million in its presale, currently in Stage 8 with tokens priced at $0.16, up 1153% from its Stage 1 entry. The sale has drawn attention from both individual investors and heavyweight institutions. A $7.5 million capital injection from a leading VC helped accelerate its growth, with all Stage 6 and 7 tokens acquired by one tech-focused firm. Further elevating its profile, a Big 5 Tech company, an early backer of ChatGPT, has reportedly invested in RCOF, boosting credibility and investor interest. These endorsements have helped drive over 282,000 app downloads and a daily user count of 122,000 on its Beta platform . The roadmap shows a Uniswap launch set for May 31, 2025, with Binance and Coinbase listings anticipated in the summer. Projections suggest a price range of $1.50 to $2.00 post-listing. RCOF’s upcoming full team doxxing, including a former Microsoft board member, adds a layer of transparency rarely seen at this stage. AI-DeFi Fusion Unlocks New Horizons What sets RCO Finance apart isn’t just its momentum; it’s the platform’s functionality. Its no-KYC structure makes access seamless for global users, unlocking 120,000+ tradable assets across crypto, stocks, ETFs, bonds, and tokenized real estate. RCOF’s standout features include Smart Portfolio Management with real-time allocation charts, customizable watchlists with alerts via Telegram and X, and a Wallet Management tool that offers intuitive oversight of assets, including NFTs and savings. A SolidProof audit reinforces the platform’s security standards. At the heart of this platform lies the AI Robo Advisor. This tool digests real-time data from Reuters and other market feeds to craft custom trading strategies tailored to user profiles. Looking ahead, the Q3 2025 rollout of AI-Powered Simulated Trading will allow users to test strategies using live data without risking capital. This innovative edge places RCO Finance far beyond the meme-fueled charm of Dogecoin. RCOF’s Binance Path to Millions Dogecoin (DOGE), with its infinite supply and meme roots, faces a cap on investor returns. At its current price, even bullish Q3 2025 targets of $0.55 offer limited upside. Unlike its meme-coin counterparts, RCO Finance is structured for scalability, scarcity, and practical use. With 1.124 billion tokens and a robust burn strategy, its model is geared toward sustained value appreciation. According to predictions, RCOF might hit $2.00 after its Uniswap launch, with the token price currently at $0.16. This represents significant upside for early participants. Upcoming listings on major exchanges and backing from a prominent ChatGPT-linked investor are expected to further accelerate adoption. Don’t Miss RCOF’s Last Presale Shot Time is running out. RCOF presale has already drawn $31 million and continues to attract a growing wave of investor interest. With Big Tech billions and Binance looming, Dogecoin’s meme fades against RCOF’s AI-DeFi revolution. Don’t wait. Stake now. Ignite your wealth.

44260542,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157699,1746586840,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,UK Crypto Policy: Crucial Clarity on National Reserves,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/uk-crypto-reserves-policy/,"In a move that clarifies the United Kingdom’s position on digital assets, the UK Treasury has firmly ruled out the possibility of establishing national cryptocurrency reserves. This announcement provides crucial insight into the government’s approach to the burgeoning crypto space and signals a distinct path compared to other nations. What Exactly Are National Crypto Reserves, and Why Are Countries Considering Them? Before diving into the UK’s decision, let’s understand what national crypto reserves entail. Conceptually, this would involve a country’s central bank or treasury holding a portion of its foreign exchange reserves or national wealth in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, rather than solely in traditional assets like gold, US dollars, or other fiat currencies. The idea of a government crypto strategy that includes reserves has emerged for several potential reasons: Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset class to traditional reserves. Hedge Against Inflation: Some view Bitcoin as a potential hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Strategic Asset: Accumulating digital assets could be seen as building a strategic position in a future digital economy. Potential for Appreciation: Hoping for long-term value growth similar to other reserve assets like gold. However, the concept is fraught with significant challenges, which likely factored into the UK’s decision. Why is the UK Treasury Saying No to National Crypto Reserves? Speaking at the Financial Times Digital Asset Summit in London, UK Economic Secretary to the Treasury, Emma Reynolds, delivered the definitive statement. According to Decrypt, she explicitly stated the government has no intentions of building a stockpile of cryptocurrencies. Reynolds directly addressed the approach taken by some entities, particularly noting the US government’s handling of seized Bitcoin (which has sometimes involved holding rather than immediate sale). However, she drew a clear line, stating, “We don’t think that’s appropriate for our market.” She elaborated that while the US strategy might be understandable in its context, it simply “does not align with the UK’s direction.” This stance highlights a key difference in how the UK Treasury crypto team views the role of digital assets within the national financial framework. Rather than viewing crypto as a reserve asset to be stockpiled, the UK appears to be focusing on other applications and regulatory frameworks. What Does This Mean for UK Crypto Policy and Innovation? Ruling out national crypto reserves doesn’t mean the UK is ignoring the potential of underlying blockchain technology. Reynolds confirmed that the UK government is actively exploring the potential use of distributed ledger technology (DLT) for issuing sovereign debt. This exploration signals a pragmatic approach: leveraging the efficiency and transparency benefits of DLT for core financial infrastructure, while remaining cautious about the volatility and risks associated with holding cryptocurrencies as a national asset. The focus appears to be on facilitating innovation within a regulated environment, rather than engaging in speculative asset accumulation. This decision reinforces the UK’s broader approach to crypto regulation UK , which aims to balance fostering innovation with ensuring financial stability and consumer protection. It suggests the UK sees its role more as a facilitator and regulator of the crypto ecosystem than as a direct participant in holding volatile digital assets on its national balance sheet. What Are the Challenges of Holding Government Crypto Stockpiles? The UK’s decision not to pursue national crypto reserves likely stems from a careful consideration of the significant challenges involved. These include: Extreme Volatility: The price swings of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are far greater than traditional reserve assets, posing significant risk to national wealth. Security Risks: Storing large amounts of crypto securely is complex and vulnerable to hacks or loss of private keys. Regulatory Uncertainty: The global regulatory landscape for crypto is still evolving, creating unpredictable risks. Public Perception: Holding volatile, often misunderstood assets could be politically challenging and raise questions about fiscal responsibility. Market Impact: Large government purchases or sales could significantly impact already volatile markets. Lack of Clear Use Case: Unlike gold or foreign currency reserves used for trade or stability, the immediate practical use of crypto reserves for government functions is limited. These factors make a strategy of accumulating national crypto reserves a high-risk proposition that the UK government seems unwilling to undertake at this time. Conclusion: A Clear Path for UK Crypto Engagement The statement from the UK Treasury provides welcome clarity on a specific aspect of the nation’s stance on digital assets. By ruling out national crypto reserves while simultaneously exploring DLT for sovereign debt, the UK government is defining a path focused on leveraging the underlying technology for infrastructure improvements and fostering a regulated environment for private sector innovation, rather than engaging in direct cryptocurrency asset management. This approach aligns with the UK’s ambition to be a global hub for financial technology, prioritizing stable and secure integration of new technologies over speculative government investment in volatile assets.

On May 6, Coinbase announced that it is launching a protocol called x402 for instant stablecoin payments directly over the internet communication protocol HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). It allows Application Programming Interface (APIs), apps, and AI agents to transact seamlessly, “unlocking a faster, automated internet economy,” the firm stated . Coinbase said that x402 “is fixing the internet’s first mistake.” The protocol resurrects the experimental HTTP 402 “Payment Required” status code to create a seamless payment system native to the internet. The firm noted that traditional payment rails, such as credit cards, bank transfers and subscriptions, “were built for a pre-internet world.” They’re slow, expensive, geographically limited, and “riddled with manual steps,” it added. However, x402 embeds stablecoin payments directly into web interactions, requiring minimal code integration, and is designed for both humans and AI agents to transact value as easily as exchanging data. x402 payment flow. Source: Coinbase The head of engineering at Coinbase Developer Platform and co-author of the x402 white paper, Erik Reppel, said, “We’re laying the groundwork for an economy run not just by people, but by software — autonomous, intelligent, and always on.” Related: Coinbase sees first crypto transaction between AI agents Gagan Mac, vice president of product management at Circle, said x402 “elegantly simplifies real-time monetization” and unlocks “exciting new use cases like micropayments for AI agents and apps.” Coinbase is launching the new protocol in partnership with AWS (Amazon Web Services), stablecoin issuer Circle, AI company Anthropic and AI-focused proof-of-stake layer-1 blockchain Near Protocol . Big benefits for agentic AI AI agents can achieve economic autonomy by independently transacting without human intervention. The protocol enables AI agents to access paid resources in real-time based on their needs and eliminates dependency on pre-paid credits, API keys, or human-managed accounts. AI agents can also provision and pay for hardware resources in real-time, access specialized data sources through micropayments, and pay other AI systems for services. The x402 protocol essentially transforms AI agents from tools that require constant human interaction into autonomous economic actors that can independently discover, purchase and utilize resources to accomplish their goals. Developers can use the protocol to monetize APIs, create software unlocks and enable metered services that dynamically charge users based on actual resource usage, while content creators can monetize their content without the need for blanket subscriptions or credit card minimums and fees.

According to Avery, this kind of calculated buying, often used by institutions to reduce price impact, could be in preparation for a spot XRP exchange-traded fund. When asked why ETF hype isn’t already driving prices higher, Avery responded that the impact may be “more gradual” over time.

In Q1, XRP outperformed Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ), rallying nearly 50% in early February, according to Ripple’s latest report . The XRP/BTC ratio rose 10%, and XRP investment products attracted $37.7 million in inflows, just shy of Ethereum’s $214 million year-to-date. A leveraged XRP ETF launched in April, and spot ETF filings from Franklin Templeton and Bitwise are pending approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Ripple has also settled its long-running SEC lawsuit with a $50 million payment, but the market reaction has been subdued, potentially because it was already priced in. While the fundamentals point to long-term potential, the technical picture remains mixed. On the bullish side, XRP has defended key support around $2.05 and remains above the 200-day estimated moving average near $1.99. Momentum indicators such as the stochastic relative strength index show oversold conditions. XRP price analysis. Credit: crypto.news A move toward the $2.30–$2.40 range may be possible if there is a clear break above the 10-day and 20-day EMAs, which are at $2.17 and $2.19, respectively. But it’s impossible to overlook the bearish scenario. XRP continues to trade below its short- and mid-term moving averages, and the RSI is neutral at 48.7, showing a lack of strong upward momentum. Momentum and moving average convergence divergence indicators also tilt slightly bearish, suggesting sellers are still active. If XRP loses the $2.05 support level, it risks slipping back toward $1.99 or even lower, which could invalidate the bullish whale accumulation thesis in the short term.

Last around $11 per token, the TRUMP coin price has stabilized just above its 50DMA at $10.50 following a volatile few weeks. Towards the end of April, the Trump coin price doubled from its earlier monthly lows to briefly break back above $16, following US President Trump’s announcement that the top 220 holders of the meme coin would be invited to a White House Gala dinner event. This announcement triggered a major surge in demand for TRUMP , but has also received an intense amount of criticism. Democrat Senator Jon Ossoff recently claimed, in announcing a Gala event for the top 220 TRUMP holders, the President is “selling access”, which could be an impeachable offense. Sen. Jon Ossoff on saying Trump’s conduct has exceeded past standards for impeachment, citing crypto venture. “Oh, I stand by those comments 100%,” he said. “It appears that the president’s business and family are being personally enriched through this cryptocurrency venture.” pic.twitter.com/wfuamlqqJi — Manu Raju (@mkraju) May 5, 2025 Meanwhile, fellow Democrat Senator and arch crypto skeptic Elizabeth Warren has been vocal in criticizing another Trump family crypto endeavor, the launch of the USD1 stablecoin via their DeFi project World Liberty Financial. The Trump family stablecoin surged to 7th largest in the world because of a shady crypto deal with the United Arab Emirates—a foreign government that will give them a crazy amount of money. The Senate shouldn’t pass a crypto bill this week to facilitate this kind of corruption. pic.twitter.com/4is9KgpXQb — Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) May 4, 2025 In wake of a controversy filled few weeks, its no wonder that the TRUMP coin price has slipped back from late April highs in the $16 area to around $11. The next sources of volatility for TRUMP are likely to be related to broader macro themes, such as tomorrow’s FOMC meeting. However, big volatility could be coming on May 22. Could the TRUMP coin price 10x? Why May 22 Could Trigger a 10x Rally (Or Total Collapse) May 22’s TRUMP diner at the White House has the potential to spark significant TRUMP coin price volatility. If the event gets a lot of coverage – perhaps President Trump attends and makes newsworthy comments, or even talks policy – this could trigger FOMO, producing a major TRUMP coin price rally similar to that seen in April. Could TRUMP rally all the way up to $100? Well, if TRUMP coin is suddenly seen as the best vehicle through which to secure access to the President, maybe. After all, that would broaden the coin’s appeal beyond just retail investors, but to business and potentially world leaders who want to get into Trump’s ear. The TRUMP coin price rose above $70 in January following its launch, so nothing should be ruled out. That said, an even bigger risk if a post-event price dump. Trump’s attendance isn’t guaranteed—attendees may get an NFT instead—potentially triggering a sell-off if expectations are unmet. In simpler terms, the Gala dinner could end up being a “sell the news” event. Against the backdrop of a struggling altcoin market, this seems very plausible. The macro backdrop remains difficult for risk assets like meme coins, with the US economy facing upside risks to inflation and downside risks to growth, and the Fed currently not eager to make any major monetary policy shifts as it monitors developments. And with the TRUMP meme coin receiving so much backlash from the Democrats right now, who are using it as part of their excuse to hold up legitimate stablecoin legislation , risks seem tilted to the downside. Investors should expect a lot of two way volatility in the TRUMP coin price in the weeks ahead. Better Alternative to Consider – Solaxy (SOLX) Solaxy (SOLX) , a Layer-2 scaling solution for Solana, has raised over $34 million in its presale, with tokens priced at $0.0017. HyperSpeed Achieved! 33 Million Raised! pic.twitter.com/HgswKcnnVM — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) May 3, 2025 Designed to address Solana’s network congestion and high transaction failure rates—evident during the TRUMP coin launch in January—Solaxy processes transactions off-chain, enhancing speed and reliability. Its interoperability with Ethereum facilitates cross-chain liquidity, and a smart contract audit by Coinsult confirms its security. In contrast, TRUMP coin, currently at $11, faces volatility due to political controversy surrounding its May 22 gala and an impending 800 million token unlock, risking price dilution. Solaxy’s focus on infrastructure and scalability may offer a more stable investment compared to TRUMP’s reliance on speculative sentiment, making it a noteworthy consideration for investors.

He called it “earth-shattering” and “a positive development for the country,” but gave no clear details about what it is. He did say it’s not about trade, which has led to plenty of speculation online. Some people believe the announcement could involve Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. There are rumors it could be about a U.S. government crypto reserve or some kind of support for digital assets. One crypto personality said the news will be “game-changing” and should come before Monday. Trump said, “We have a big announcement to make, not about trade but something else but it’s going to be a truly earth shattering and a positive development for this country and for the people of this country.” Others think the announcement may be about international politics. Online AI assistant Grok shared a few possible options based on current global events. These include a possible ceasefire deal in Gaza that could last five to seven years, a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia that accepts some Russian territorial gains, or a new nuclear deal with Iran in exchange for easing sanctions. All of these would be major steps toward global peace, but none have been confirmed.

44261120,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157817,1746588029,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,NEAR ETF Excitement: Bitwise Submits SEC Filing,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitwise-near-etf-filing/,"Big news is circulating in the cryptocurrency world! Asset management firm Bitwise has taken a significant step towards bringing NEAR Protocol into the mainstream financial landscape by filing an application for a spot NEAR ETF with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This development, initially reported by Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart on X (formerly Twitter), marks a notable moment for the NEAR ecosystem and the broader digital asset market. While the path to approval is often lengthy and complex, the filing itself signals growing interest from established financial players in offering regulated investment products tied to specific cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. What Does a Bitwise NEAR Filing Mean? When Bitwise files an S-1 application with the SEC, it’s essentially submitting a registration statement for a new security – in this case, shares of a proposed exchange-traded fund that would hold NEAR tokens directly. This is the initial formal step in the process for seeking regulatory approval to list and trade the fund on a national securities exchange. Here’s a breakdown of what this entails: Formal Intent: The S-1 filing clearly states Bitwise’s intention to launch a spot NEAR ETF , demonstrating a commitment to creating this investment vehicle. Detailed Disclosure: The application provides extensive information about the proposed fund, including its investment strategy (holding physical NEAR), risk factors, creation and redemption mechanisms, fees, and the parties involved. Beginning of SEC Review: The filing triggers the SEC’s formal review process. This involves regulators examining the application to ensure it complies with securities laws and protects investors. Transparency: The S-1 becomes a public document, allowing investors and the market to scrutinize the proposed fund’s structure and potential implications. This move by Bitwise, a firm already active in the crypto fund space, underscores the increasing demand for regulated and accessible ways to invest in digital assets like NEAR. Why is a Spot NEAR Protocol ETF Significant? The potential launch of a spot NEAR Protocol ETF is significant for several reasons, primarily revolving around bridging the gap between traditional finance and the crypto market: Benefits for Investors and the Market: Accessibility: An ETF allows investors to gain exposure to NEAR through traditional brokerage accounts, eliminating the need to set up crypto wallets, manage private keys, or navigate cryptocurrency exchanges. Liquidity: ETFs trade on major stock exchanges, offering high liquidity and ease of buying and selling shares throughout the trading day. Familiarity: The ETF structure is well-understood by traditional investors and financial advisors, potentially attracting capital from individuals and institutions who are hesitant to invest directly in crypto. Regulatory Clarity (Post-Approval): An approved SEC-regulated ETF operates under stringent oversight, potentially offering investors a greater sense of security and trust compared to unregulated avenues. Potential for Increased Demand: Institutional investors, such as pension funds and wealth managers, often have mandates that restrict them from holding direct cryptocurrency but allow them to invest in regulated ETF products. A SEC NEAR ETF could unlock significant institutional capital. Potential Challenges and Considerations: SEC Approval Process: The SEC’s review is rigorous and can take months, involving multiple rounds of questions and amendments to the S-1 filing. Approval is not guaranteed. Market Volatility: While the ETF structure provides accessibility, the underlying asset (NEAR) remains subject to significant price volatility inherent in the crypto market. Fees: ETFs charge management fees, which can impact overall investment returns compared to direct ownership (though direct ownership has its own costs and complexities). Competition: If approved, a NEAR ETF would compete with other potential crypto investment products and direct NEAR ownership. The filing for a Bitwise NEAR ETF joins a growing list of applications for single-asset crypto ETFs, following similar efforts for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. This trend suggests a broader push within the asset management industry to offer diverse regulated crypto exposure. How Does This Relate to Other Crypto ETF Developments? The filing for a NEAR Protocol ETF comes after significant developments in the broader Crypto ETF landscape, particularly the approval and successful launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. earlier this year. The SEC’s approval of Bitcoin ETFs set a precedent and demonstrated a potential shift in regulatory comfort with spot crypto products. Here’s a brief comparison: Feature Spot Bitcoin ETFs (Approved) Proposed Spot NEAR ETF (Under Review) Underlying Asset Bitcoin (BTC) NEAR Protocol (NEAR) Current Status Approved and Trading S-1 Application Filed, Under SEC Review Precedent Set the precedent for spot crypto ETFs in the U.S. Builds on the precedent, tests SEC’s stance on altcoin ETFs Focus Largest and most established cryptocurrency Focus on a specific, prominent layer-1 blockchain protocol While the Bitcoin ETF approvals provide a hopeful backdrop, the SEC’s approach to approving ETFs for other cryptocurrencies is not guaranteed and will likely involve careful consideration of each asset’s market structure, regulatory status, and potential for manipulation. What’s Next for the Bitwise NEAR ETF Application? The S-1 filing is just the beginning. The application will now go through a formal review process with the SEC. This process typically involves: Public Comment Period: The SEC will solicit public comments on the proposed rule change required to list the ETF shares. SEC Questions and Amendments: SEC staff will likely issue comments and questions to Bitwise regarding the filing, requiring amendments to the S-1. Decision Deadlines: The SEC has specific deadlines to make decisions on such filings, although these deadlines can often be extended. The outcome of this application will be closely watched by the crypto community and traditional finance alike. An approval would not only be a significant win for NEAR Protocol but could also pave the way for ETFs tracking other individual cryptocurrencies, further integrating the digital asset market into traditional investment vehicles. Actionable Insights for Investors and NEAR Enthusiasts For those interested in NEAR Protocol or the broader crypto market, this filing offers several key takeaways: Stay Informed: Follow news from Bitwise, the SEC, and reputable financial news sources for updates on the application’s progress. Bloomberg analysts like James Seyffart are valuable resources for tracking these filings. Understand the Product: If approved, understand that a NEAR ETF is a regulated financial product traded on stock exchanges. Research its structure, fees, and risks before investing. Evaluate NEAR Protocol: An ETF filing doesn’t change the fundamentals of NEAR Protocol itself. Continue to research the technology, ecosystem, and development progress of NEAR independently. Consider Market Impact: While an ETF could bring increased demand, the price of NEAR will still be influenced by broader market trends, regulatory news, and project-specific developments. The filing by Bitwise is a strong signal of increasing institutional interest in NEAR Protocol. It represents a potential future avenue for investors to access NEAR through a familiar and regulated wrapper. Conclusion: A Promising Step for NEAR’s Integration Bitwise’s S-1 filing for a spot NEAR ETF is undoubtedly a significant and exciting development for the NEAR Protocol ecosystem and the broader cryptocurrency investment landscape. While the regulatory path ahead involves hurdles and no outcome is guaranteed, this formal step by a reputable asset manager like Bitwise highlights the growing maturation of the crypto market and the increasing demand for regulated investment products. The potential approval of a SEC NEAR ETF could unlock new avenues for institutional and retail investors alike, potentially increasing liquidity and adoption for NEAR. As the SEC reviews the application, the market will be watching closely to see if NEAR will be the next cryptocurrency to gain a regulated ETF vehicle in the United States.

In a significant move for the cryptocurrency and fintech world, Strike, the popular Bitcoin Lightning-based payments application founded by Jack Mallers, has officially entered the lending space. This isn’t just any lending; they’re launching a new Bitcoin-backed lending program, allowing both individual and corporate accounts to borrow funds using their Bitcoin holdings as collateral. This development is poised to offer a fresh avenue for accessing liquidity without requiring users to sell their precious Bitcoin. What is Bitcoin-Backed Lending and Why Does it Matter? Before diving into Strike’s specific offering, let’s quickly cover the concept of Bitcoin-backed lending . At its core, it’s a financial service that allows Bitcoin holders to borrow traditional currency (like USD) by pledging their Bitcoin as security. Think of it like getting a mortgage or a car loan, but instead of real estate or a vehicle, your collateral is your Bitcoin. Why would someone do this? The primary motivation is often to access liquidity without triggering a taxable event by selling their Bitcoin. If you believe your Bitcoin will appreciate further, selling it to cover immediate expenses or investments means losing potential future gains and incurring capital gains taxes. Lending against it allows you to get the cash you need while still maintaining ownership and exposure to Bitcoin’s potential upside. Exploring the Strike Lending Program Details Strike’s new program, initially rolling out in select regions across the U.S., brings this concept to their user base. According to reports from The Block, here are the key details: Loan Amounts: The program targets significant borrowers, offering loans ranging from a minimum of $75,000 up to $2 million. This indicates a focus on high-net-worth individuals or businesses rather than smaller retail loans. Loan Term: Loans are structured with a fixed 12-month term. This provides clarity on the repayment timeline for borrowers. Annual Percentage Rate (APR): The loans come with a minimum 12% APR. Borrowers need to factor this interest cost into their financial planning. Collateral Asset: Exclusively uses Bitcoin (BTC) as the required collateral. Availability: Currently limited to specific U.S. regions, with potential expansion expected later. This structure suggests Strike is entering the market with a focused, potentially more conservative approach compared to some other players in the broader crypto lending space, especially concerning the fixed term and minimum loan size. The Power of Bitcoin Collateral Using Bitcoin collateral for a loan is a double-edged sword, but for many Bitcoin holders, the benefits outweigh the risks, provided they understand the mechanics. Here’s why it’s powerful: Accessing Capital Without Selling: As mentioned, this is the biggest draw. You get the cash you need for investments, business expenses, or personal use without liquidating your Bitcoin holdings. Maintaining Bitcoin Exposure: You continue to hold your Bitcoin, meaning you benefit if its price increases during the loan term. Potential Tax Advantages: Borrowing against an asset is generally not a taxable event, unlike selling the asset for a gain. ( Note: Always consult with a tax professional regarding your specific situation. ) Speed and Simplicity (Potentially): Crypto-backed loans can sometimes be approved faster than traditional loans, although the process for Strike’s program is yet to be fully detailed publicly regarding speed. However, the volatility of Bitcoin means using it as collateral introduces significant risk. This is where understanding the terms, particularly the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio and potential margin calls, becomes crucial. Potential Benefits of Strike Lending for Users For the target audience – likely high-net-worth individuals and businesses – Strike’s entry into Strike lending offers several potential advantages: Firstly, it leverages Strike’s existing infrastructure and reputation. Users familiar with Strike’s payments app might find the lending service a natural extension. The integration within the Strike ecosystem could potentially streamline the process. Secondly, it provides a regulated on-ramp for obtaining liquidity against Bitcoin in select U.S. regions. Operating within regulatory frameworks is often a priority for larger borrowers. Thirdly, the fixed 12-month term provides predictability. Borrowers know exactly when the loan is due, which can help in financial planning, especially for business use cases. Understanding the Risks in Crypto Lending While the benefits are clear, anyone considering crypto lending , including Strike’s new program, must be fully aware of the risks involved. The primary risk stems directly from using a volatile asset like Bitcoin as collateral. 1. Bitcoin Price Volatility: This is the most significant risk. If the price of Bitcoin drops substantially, the value of your collateral decreases. Lending platforms use a Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio to manage this risk. If the LTV ratio (Loan Amount / Collateral Value) exceeds a certain threshold due to a price drop, you will likely face a margin call. 2. Margin Calls: A margin call occurs when the value of your collateral falls below the required level. The platform will require you to add more Bitcoin collateral or repay a portion of the loan to bring the LTV back within acceptable limits. Failing to meet a margin call can result in the forced liquidation (selling) of your Bitcoin collateral by the lender to cover the loan balance. This is the worst-case scenario, as you lose your Bitcoin at a potentially unfavorable price. 3. Interest Rate Risk: While Strike’s initial APR is stated as a minimum, potential changes in market conditions could influence future offerings or the overall cost of borrowing. 4. Platform Risk: Although Strike is a known entity, using any platform involves counterparty risk. Borrowers entrust their collateral to the platform. These risks highlight the need for borrowers to maintain a careful watch on the price of Bitcoin and have a plan in place to address potential margin calls. Who is This Program For? Insights from Jack Mallers Strike Given the minimum loan amount of $75,000, Strike’s program is clearly targeting a specific demographic. This isn’t designed for someone looking to borrow a few thousand dollars for an emergency. Instead, it’s aimed at: High-Net-Worth Individuals: Individuals with substantial Bitcoin holdings who need access to significant capital for investments, real estate, or other large expenditures without selling their BTC. Businesses: Companies that hold Bitcoin on their balance sheet and need working capital, funds for expansion, or to cover operational costs. This focus aligns with a growing trend of integrating Bitcoin into more traditional financial strategies for larger players. It reflects a vision, potentially driven by Jack Mallers Strike , to bridge the gap between the Bitcoin economy and traditional finance, offering sophisticated financial products built around digital assets. Actionable Insights Before Taking a Bitcoin-Backed Lending Loan Considering a Bitcoin-backed lending loan from Strike or any other provider? Here are some crucial actionable insights: Understand the LTV Ratio: Know the initial LTV and, more importantly, the margin call LTV threshold. Calculate how much the price of Bitcoin needs to drop before a margin call is triggered. Have a Plan for Margin Calls: Decide beforehand how you will handle a margin call. Will you add more collateral, or do you have alternative funds available to repay part of the loan? Monitor Bitcoin Price Constantly: You must actively track the market price of Bitcoin to avoid being caught off guard by a margin call. Assess Your Need for Liquidity: Is this loan truly necessary? Could you obtain funds through traditional means? Compare the costs and risks. Read the Terms and Conditions Carefully: Pay close attention to interest rates, fees, repayment terms, and the liquidation process. Consult a Financial Advisor: Especially for large loan amounts, getting professional financial advice is highly recommended. The Broader Impact on Bitcoin and Finance Strike’s launch of a Bitcoin-backed lending program is more than just a new product offering; it’s a signal of the maturing Bitcoin ecosystem. It demonstrates that Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed not just as a speculative asset, but as a legitimate form of collateral that can be used in sophisticated financial products. This could pave the way for more institutional and corporate adoption, as it provides tools for managing liquidity without divesting from Bitcoin holdings. While other platforms offer similar services, Strike’s move is noteworthy due to its focus on the Lightning Network for payments and its prominent role in advocating for Bitcoin adoption. Expanding into lending adds another layer to its financial services suite, positioning Strike as a more comprehensive financial platform in the future. Conclusion: A Powerful New Tool, But Proceed with Caution Strike’s foray into Bitcoin-backed lending represents a powerful new opportunity for Bitcoin holders, particularly businesses and high-net-worth individuals, to access significant liquidity without selling their assets. Leveraging Bitcoin collateral allows users to potentially benefit from future price appreciation while meeting current financial needs. However, like all forms of crypto lending , it comes with inherent risks, most notably the volatility of Bitcoin and the potential for margin calls and liquidation. Understanding these risks and having a clear strategy is paramount. As Jack Mallers Strike continues to build out its financial ecosystem, this lending program marks a significant step in making Bitcoin a more functional and integrated part of the broader financial world.

For those in the cryptocurrency space, who often value pseudonymity and decentralized communication, this presents unique challenges. The recent uproar on Reddit highlights a growing concern: how do we ensure genuine human interaction in the face of increasingly sophisticated AI bots? This incident is pushing Reddit towards implementing new measures, specifically focusing on Reddit verification , which could significantly impact user experience and privacy expectations. The Invasion of AI Bots on Reddit The catalyst for Reddit’s impending changes was a large-scale experiment that saw a swarm of AI-powered bots infiltrate the ‘Change My View’ subreddit. These bots were designed to mimic human users convincingly, posting over 1,700 comments and adopting diverse, sometimes controversial, personas. The goal was to test AI’s persuasive capabilities. For Reddit, a platform built on the premise of real people sharing real opinions, this was a serious threat to its core identity and trustworthiness. The company condemned the experiment, calling it ‘improper and highly unethical’. The presence of advanced AI bots isn’t just a nuisance; it risks degrading the quality of discourse and making it difficult for users to trust the information they encounter. This is particularly relevant in fast-moving spaces like cryptocurrency, where accurate, human-driven insights are crucial. Why Reddit Verification is Becoming Necessary Reddit’s decision to explore stricter verification stems directly from the threat posed by these advanced AI impersonators and evolving regulatory pressures. CEO Steve Huffman indicated that the platform would begin working with third-party services to verify user humanity. This marks a significant shift for Reddit, which has historically allowed users to create accounts with minimal personal information. The core reasons driving this change include: Maintaining Authenticity: Protecting the platform’s reputation as a place for genuine human interaction. Combating Manipulation: Preventing bots from being used for spam, misinformation, or political manipulation. Meeting Regulations: Adhering to new laws, particularly those requiring age verification on social media platforms in various locations. While the specifics remain under wraps, this move towards more robust Reddit verification is a direct response to the escalating capabilities of generative AI. The Tension: Online Anonymity vs. Verification Reddit’s historical strength lies in providing a space for online anonymity , allowing users to share sensitive experiences, express unpopular opinions, and engage in discussions they might avoid if their real identity were attached. This anonymity fosters open dialogue and protects users in vulnerable situations. However, the need for verification directly clashes with this foundational principle. The question becomes: how can Reddit verify humanity or age without compromising the anonymity that users value? This is the central challenge the platform faces. Many users fear that any form of verification, even through third parties, could eventually lead to a loss of the protective layer that online anonymity provides. Concerns Over Data Privacy Introducing third-party verification services raises significant concerns about data privacy . These services often require government-issued IDs or other sensitive personal information to confirm identity or age. Sharing this data with social media platforms, even indirectly through partners, carries inherent risks. The fear is that this sensitive information could be vulnerable to data breaches or, more troublingly, be accessed by authorities. The article highlights a stark example involving Meta handing over private messages that led to legal charges, illustrating the potential consequences when platforms hold identifiable information linked to sensitive discussions. Reddit CEO Steve Huffman stated the company would be ‘extremely protective’ of user data and push back against excessive demands, but the risk remains a major point of contention for users who prioritize data privacy . The Future of Social Media Verification Reddit’s planned changes are indicative of a broader trend in social media verification . As AI technology advances and regulatory demands increase, platforms are under pressure to find ways to confirm the identity or humanity of their users. While established methods often involve linking accounts to phone numbers or requiring ID uploads, newer, more speculative technologies like ‘proof of human’ concepts are also being explored. The challenge for all platforms, including Reddit, is to implement effective verification measures that combat bots and comply with regulations without eroding user trust, compromising online anonymity , or jeopardizing data privacy . The outcome of Reddit’s approach will likely set a precedent for how other platforms navigate this complex issue in the age of advanced AI. Conclusion Reddit is at a crossroads, forced to balance its founding principle of anonymity with the urgent need to combat sophisticated AI bots and meet regulatory requirements. The move towards mandatory verification, while necessary to preserve the platform’s authenticity and integrity against AI threats, introduces significant friction for users who rely on online anonymity and are concerned about data privacy . How Reddit implements these changes, and whether they can find a way to verify users without revealing their identities, will be crucial in determining the future character of the platform and serve as a case study for the evolving landscape of social media verification in the age of pervasive AI.

Historically, when both assets rally, Bitcoin tends to outperform — and with gold making fresh highs, analysts believe Bitcoin could be next. Kiyosaki Choose Bitcoin Over Gold and Silver “21 million is 21 million.” That’s the message from Robert Kiyosaki, author of Rich Dad Poor Dad , in a recent post on X. While he owns gold and silver mines, Kiyosaki emphasized that unlike metals, Bitcoin’s supply is permanently fixed at 21 million coins — no central bank or mining firm can produce more. This scarcity, he argues, is what makes Bitcoin the most reliable hedge against inflation, monetary debasement, and global uncertainty. “I can always mine more gold if prices rise,” he said, “but Bitcoin is locked forever.” Gold Hits $3,500 — Will Bitcoin Follow? Gold surged to $3,500 in April before cooling to $3,237 as of May 5 — still a 33% gain YTD. Bitcoin, meanwhile, has remained flat with just a 0.82% rise this year. But this may be the calm before a breakout. Crypto analyst Cryptollica points to historical patterns: from March 2020 to March 2022, gold rose 35.5%, while Bitcoin soared over 1,100%. If a similar trend plays out, BTC could rally to $155,000, especially if it breaks its current resistance range. Fed Rate Decision Could Be the Trigger The upcoming U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate decision is another catalyst. Despite Donald Trump pushing for a rate cut, the CME FedWatch Tool shows a 97% probability the Fed will keep rates steady this week. However, if policy shifts in the second half of 2025, it could unleash a wave of liquidity — boosting both gold and Bitcoin. Why It Matters Scarcity narrative is fueling long-term Bitcoin confidence. Gold is up 33% YTD , while Bitcoin is still consolidating . Kiyosaki joins a growing chorus of investors positioning BTC as a safer, inflation-resistant asset. Kiyosaki’s endorsement is more than just hype — it taps into Bitcoin’s core value proposition.

Recently, Arvind Krishna, the CEO of IBM, voiced a strong opinion that resonates across the tech sector: federal investment in AI research and development needs to grow, not shrink. Speaking in an interview with Bitcoin World, Krishna made his position clear, especially concerning current proposals impacting Federal AI Funding . Why is the IBM CEO AI Concerned About Funding Cuts? Arvind Krishna, like many prominent figures in technology, sees robust federal investment as fundamental to national competitiveness and technological advancement. “We have been an extremely strong advocate — and this is both the company and me personally — on that federally funded R&D should be increased,” Krishna stated. This is not just a corporate stance but a personal conviction, emphasizing the unequivocal belief that more government investment in R&D is crucial for the future. The concern stems from proposed budget cuts by the Trump administration. These proposals target significant reductions in federal grantmaking and scientific research programs, a departure from previous policy approaches. Key offices focused on AI research, such as the Directorate for Technology, Innovation, and Partnerships (TIP) within the National Science Foundation (NSF), have already faced steep budget reductions. Staffing cuts are also impacting institutions like the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the NSF itself. The Impact on AI R&D Funding The proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 includes calls to significantly cut the NSF’s funding, targeting billions of dollars currently awarded to AI R&D projects. Other federal agencies that contribute substantially to AI research, such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Department of Energy (DOE), also face potential cuts. Beyond direct research funding, there are threats to programs like the CHIPS Act, designed to boost domestic semiconductor production critical for AI technologies. The office responsible for managing CHIPS Act funds saw significant restructuring recently. These potential reductions are viewed with alarm by the tech industry. Groups like The Software and Information Industry Association (SIIA) have formally warned that these cuts could severely hobble America’s global leadership position in AI. This isn’t just about academic research; federally funded research has a proven track record of yielding high economic returns. According to the U.S. Joint Economic Committee, the annual return on federally funded research is estimated at 25-40%, a figure that compares favorably to returns from top-tier venture capital funds (15-27%). Investing in AI R&D Funding is not just about science; it’s about economic strategy. Protecting US AI Leadership Krishna highlighted the broader economic and competitive implications. “We believe that [federal R&D funding] right now [is] happening at close to historic lows in terms of percentage of GDP,” he told Bitcoin World. He argued that increasing federally funded R&D has a profoundly positive effect on the economy, stimulating growth, enhancing the competitiveness of the United States on the global stage, and fostering the development of technologies essential for the future. Maintaining US AI Leadership requires sustained, significant investment. Challenges from Government AI Policy Shifts While advocating for increased funding, IBM has also experienced the direct impact of shifting Government AI Policy and budget priorities. During their Q1 earnings call in April, IBM reported the cancellation of 15 federal contracts, representing $100 million in future revenue. While federal contracts constitute a relatively small portion of IBM’s overall business (between 5% and 10% of its consulting practice), these cancellations illustrate the tangible effects of government spending adjustments on even large corporations. Despite these challenges, Krishna expressed optimism about the future. He believes that the importance of R&D funding for critical technologies like AI, quantum computing, and semiconductors will lead to a positive correction. “I expect that in a year federally funded R&D for AI, for quantum, for semiconductors — I expect it to be in as good or in a better shape than it is today,” Krishna stated, suggesting a potential turnaround in funding levels. Summary: The Urgent Need for AI Investment The message from IBM CEO Arvind Krishna is clear and aligns with warnings from across the tech industry: cutting federal funding for AI R&D is detrimental to America’s economic future and global standing. While facing immediate impacts from budget shifts, there remains hope that policymakers will recognize the high returns and strategic importance of investing in foundational research and development. Sustained Federal AI Funding is seen not just as a government expense, but as a vital investment in innovation, competitiveness, and the future of technology.

Several on-chain metrics appear to support Coinvo’s assessment, as ETH accumulation addresses continue to stack the digital asset despite lackluster price performance over the past few years. Ethereum May Be Due A Rally Soon Although ETH has risen 8% over the past two weeks, it remains down 43% over the past year, trading around $1,700 at the time of writing. From its all-time high (ATH), Ethereum is down 63.6%, in stark contrast to Bitcoin (BTC), which is trading just 13.7% below its ATH. Related Reading: Ethereum Capitulation Nearing Its End? Key On-Chain Metric Reveals Insights Ethereum’s relatively poor performance compared to other major cryptocurrencies has raised questions about its long-term outlook. While Bitcoin benefits from its first-mover advantage and broader institutional adoption, Ethereum faces increasing competition from rival smart contract platforms like Solana (SOL), SUI, and Polkadot (DOT). Despite prevailing negative sentiment, some analysts believe ETH could be on the verge of a turnaround. Coinvo, for instance, claims that Ethereum is significantly undervalued and could be poised for a massive rally. The trader shared the following chart leveraging the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Z-score – a metric used to identify potential market tops and bottoms. According to the chart, Ethereum’s MVRV Z-score has now entered the green zone – between 0 and -1 – a range that historically signals a market bottom and possible trend reversal. Meanwhile, inflows into Ethereum accumulation addresses have surged to historic highs. In an X post, analyst CryptoGoos shared a chart showing record ETH inflows into these addresses in 2025. ​​High inflows to accumulation addresses indicate that long-term investors are actively buying and holding ETH, even during market downturns. This behavior often reflects growing confidence in Ethereum’s future value and suggests a potential bullish sentiment building beneath the surface. In a separate post, CryptoGoos also highlighted that Ethereum’s exchange reserves are at a multi-year low. Diminishing reserves on exchanges point to reduced selling pressure and a tightening supply, which could strengthen ETH’s scarcity narrative and drive prices higher in the near term. ETH Holders Not ‘Bullish Enough’ Noted analyst Crypto Rover drew parallels between ETH’s current price action and BTC’s 2021 trajectory. According to the analyst, if Ethereum mirrors Bitcoin’s past performance, it may be on track to reach a new ATH in the coming months.

The price is now facing resistance near $2.1650 and struggling to continue higher. XRP price started a recovery wave from the $2.080 zone. The price is now trading below $2.170 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2.160 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start another increase if there is a close above the $2.1680 resistance. XRP Price Recovery Could Fade XRP price started a downside correction below the $2.20 and $2.150 levels, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price even declined below the $2.120 level before the bulls appeared. A low was formed at $2.0780 and the price is now correcting losses. There was a move above the $2.10 and $2.120 levels. The price cleared the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.2579 swing high to the $2.078 low. However, the bears are active near the $2.1650 zone. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2.160 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading below $2.170 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.160 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.1680 level and the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.2579 swing high to the $2.078 low. The next resistance is $2.20. A clear move above the $2.20 resistance might send the price toward the $2.220 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.250 resistance or even $2.30 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.320. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.160 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.120 level. The next major support is near the $2.080 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.080 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.050 support. The next major support sits near the $2.020 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $2.120 and $2.080.

Bitcoin Breaks $97K Amid U.S. Tariff Shift,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-is-crypto-up-today-bitcoin-breaks-97k-amid-u-s-tariff-shift/,"The post Why Is Crypto Up Today? Bitcoin Breaks $97K Amid U.S. Tariff Shift appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is witnessing a powerful breakout as Bitcoin crosses the $97,000 mark , fueling a broad-based rally across digital assets. In the past 24 hours, the global crypto market cap surged by 1.64% to $2.98 trillion , driven primarily by bullish momentum in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin exploded by over $3,500 within hours to hit $97,469 , triggering $55 million in short liquidations . The surge was backed by $24.27 billion in trading volume , with Bitcoin now commanding 64% of the total market dominance . Its Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains at a healthy 66, indicating strong buyer interest without entering overbought territory. Why Crypto is Surging? One major catalyst is the renewed optimism over global trade . The U.S. government announced it is restarting trade negotiations with 18 countries—excluding China . Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed the move, which markets interpreted as a step toward easing economic tensions. The update sparked a short-lived risk rally , contributing to Bitcoin’s squeeze higher. This tariff news indicates a potential shift in U.S. trade policy under Donald Trump’s influence, as he continues pushing for lower interest rates and friendlier economic terms. Government Adoption Boosts Sentiment Institutional interest hit a new high as New Hampshire became the first U.S. state to approve crypto investments for its treasury . Governor Kelly Ayotte signed a bill allowing the state to allocate funds to top-tier digital assets like Bitcoin, marking a new era of state-level crypto adoption . Adding to the bullish tone, Binance founder CZ predicted Bitcoin could hit $500K to $1M this cycle . He cited growing ETF flows, government accumulation, and sovereign adoption by countries like El Salvador and Bhutan as reasons for the upside potential. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Robert Kiyosaki Says Bitcoin Is the Better Investment Not Gold or Silver , Altcoins and Meme Coins Ride the Wave While Bitcoin leads the charge, altcoins are tagging along: Ethereum rose 1.02% to $1,824 Solana added 0.90% to $145.67 BNB gained 0.58% to reach $602.30 XRP stood out with a 1.44% daily jump and 4.46% weekly rise Smaller-cap tokens like LAYER and ALPACA saw explosive 30% gains, while meme coins such as GORK and Fartcoin posted eye-catching spikes on decentralized platforms.

ADA Recovery Could Fade Soon,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/ada/cardano-bounce-losing-strength-ada-0-6850/,"Cardano price started a recovery wave from the $0.6420 zone. ADA is now facing resistance near $0.6850 and might decline again. ADA price started a recovery wave from the $0.6420 zone. The price is trading below $0.680 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $0.650 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it clears the $0.6850 resistance zone. Cardano Price Faces Resistance In the past few days, Cardano saw a fresh decline from the $0.730 level, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . ADA declined below the $0.70 and $0.680 support levels. A low was formed at $0.6426 and the price is again moving higher. There was a move above the $0.6550 level. The price cleared the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.7298 swing high to the $0.6426 low. Besides, there was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $0.650 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair. However, the bears are active near the $0.6850 resistance and the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.7298 swing high to the $0.6426 low. Cardano price is now trading below $0.680 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.680 zone. The first resistance is near $0.6850. The next key resistance might be $0.7090. If there is a close above the $0.7090 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $0.730 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $0.750 in the near term. Another Drop in ADA? If Cardano’s price fails to climb above the $0.6850 resistance level, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $0.6630 level. The next major support is near the $0.6500 level. A downside break below the $0.650 level could open the doors for a test of $0.6320. The next major support is near the $0.6175 level where the bulls might emerge. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ADA/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for ADA/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $0.6630 and $0.6500.

Wallets with less than 0.1 BTC sold around 290 BTC, indicating smaller retail investors are either panic selling or selling out of boredom. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen $4.41 billion in inflows since March 26. While larger Bitcoin holders remain confident and continue accumulating the asset, data from a crypto analytics platform shows that smaller retail investors have been shedding BTC amid the asset’s prolonged consolidation below the $100,000 price level. The contrasting behavior between Bitcoin ( BTC ) whales and retail investors often signals that Bitcoin may be heading toward another upward trend, Santiment said in a May 6 X post. Bitcoin smaller players show cold feet “When large wallets gradually accumulate in tandem with retail panic selling/selling out of boredom, it is generally a strong long-term sign of prices biding their time before another breakout,” Santiment said. Bitcoin wallet holders with between 10 and 10,000 BTC have accumulated a combined 81,338 BTC over the past six weeks since March 26. This represents a 0.61% increase in the cohort’s total holdings. Santiment said this could signal a potential retest of the psychological $100,000 price level in the near future. “As May progresses, Bitcoin’s key stakeholders are mostly moving in the right direction if you’re rooting for $100K BTC in the near future,” Santiment said. However, Bitcoin wallets with less than 0.1 BTC sold off approximately 290 Bitcoin over the same period. Since March 26, Bitcoin has traded between $76,273 and $97,210, according to CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin is trading at $96,360 at the time of publication. Source: CoinMarketCap Bitcoin fell below $100,000 on Feb. 1 after US President Donald Trump announced his tariffs and has yet to reclaim that price level . At the time of publication, Bitcoin is trading at $96,360. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETF holders have accumulated over the same period, with US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs totaling $4.41 billion in inflows since March 26, according to Farside data. Bitcoin dominance continues to soar The overall crypto market is still concentrated around Bitcoin. Bitcoin dominance reached 65% on May 6, the highest reading since January 2021, according to TradingView data. Related: Watch these Bitcoin price levels as BTC meets ‘decision point’ At the time of publication, the metric is 65.19%. Meanwhile, CoinMarketCap’s altcoin season index still reads “Bitcoin Season,” indicating the market is favoring Bitcoin over altcoins.

Blockchain security firm CertiK said in a May 6 post to X that the 100 Ether ( ETH ), worth $182,783 at current prices, was moved from a different address initially used in the exploit but can be traced back to the hacker. In March 2022, the exploiter took advantage of a “built-in callback function” in the ERC677 token standard and allowed them to drain the platform’s lending pool through a reentrancy attack , according to CertiK. Source: CertiK After the exploit, Voltage Finance reported that the hacker stole various stablecoins and other crypto, including USDC ( USDC ), Binance USD (BUSD), wrapped Bitcoin ( WBTC ), and Ethereum tokens. The address used by the hacker to get the funds to Tornado Cash had been dormant since November, with the last transaction occurring 166 days ago, Etherscan data shows . In a postmortem of the 2022 exploit, Voltage Finance said the attacker’s address was flagged on Etherscan, and exchanges had been asked to block any transactions. Attempts were also made to contact the attacker and negotiate a bounty to return the funds. Voltage Finance staking pools hit in March exploit Voltage Finance was hit again by another exploit on March 18, when its Simple Staking pools were compromised, the protocol said in a statement posted to X. In total, $322,000 was stolen. In its March 20 postmortem, Voltage Finance said it offered the attacker a bounty of $50,000 to return the funds and had possibly identified a developer who worked on the Simple Staking pools, who may have been involved. “While we haven’t confirmed if he is the hacker, as a precaution, we revoked his access immediately and filed police reports to collaborate with law enforcement and centralized exchanges,” it said. Related: Crypto hackers hit DeFi for $92M in April as attacks double from March Overall crypto losses spiked by 1,163% in April , with the lion’s share coming from a single heist of an elderly US individual’s wallet , after a hacker used advanced social engineering tactics to steal 3,520 Bitcoin ( BTC ), worth $330.7 million. Excluding that attack, April’s crypto losses were $34 million, a 21% jump from March. However, the month also saw over $18 million returned when the hacker behind the $7.5 million exploit of decentralized exchange KiloEx returned all the stolen funds only four days after the attack. The ZKsync Association also recovered $5 million worth of stolen tokens from an April 15 security incident involving its airdrop distribution contract.

44264490,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157950,1746594616,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Hugging Face AI Launches Free, Promising Agent for Computer Automation",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/hugging-face-ai-agent/,"In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, where advancements continually reshape how we interact with technology, a significant development comes from the Hugging Face team. Known for their contributions to open source AI, they have released a new tool that ventures into the realm of computer control. This initiative provides a glimpse into the future of automation, potentially impacting everything from personal workflows to enterprise operations, and aligns with the broader tech trends observed in sectors like cryptocurrency where efficiency and innovation are key. What is the Hugging Face AI Agent? The tool in question is called Open Computer Agent. It’s a cloud-hosted, freely available AI agent designed to operate a virtual computer environment based on Linux. Think of it as an AI assistant that can actually see and interact with a computer screen, much like a human user would. It comes preloaded with applications like Firefox, enabling it to perform web-based tasks. The concept is similar to other emerging tools in the field, such as OpenAI’s Operator. Users can provide Open Computer Agent with a natural language prompt describing a task, and the agent attempts to execute it within the virtual machine. For example, you might ask it to “Use Google Maps to find the Hugging Face HQ in Paris,” and the agent would theoretically open Firefox, navigate to Google Maps, and perform the search steps. Exploring Computer Automation with AI This release is a practical demonstration of computer automation powered by AI. The agent leverages underlying AI models, particularly advanced vision models, to understand what is happening on the screen. According to Aymeric Roucher from the Hugging Face agents team, these models support “grounding,” which is the ability to pinpoint elements on the screen by their coordinates. This capability is crucial as it allows the agent to “click any item” or interact with specific interface elements within the virtual environment. While the technology behind it is complex, the user interaction is designed to be straightforward: you tell the agent what you want done, and it tries to figure out the sequence of actions needed to achieve the goal on the virtual computer. This represents a significant step towards making sophisticated computer use accessible via simple AI commands. Understanding Agentic AI Capabilities In testing, Open Computer Agent handles simple requests reasonably well. Tasks that involve basic navigation or information retrieval within a web browser are often completed successfully. This showcases the foundational Agentic AI capabilities that allow it to interpret commands and translate them into computer actions. However, the current version faces limitations. More complicated tasks, such as searching for specific flight details or navigating complex forms, can still pose challenges. The agent also frequently encounters CAPTCHA tests, which it is currently unable to solve, halting its progress. Furthermore, as a free, cloud-hosted service, user demand means there’s often a virtual queue, adding wait times ranging from seconds to minutes before you can use the agent. The Open Source AI Vision Behind the Tool The Hugging Face team emphasizes that the primary goal of releasing Open Computer Agent wasn’t necessarily to deliver a polished, production-ready product immediately. Instead, it serves as a proof-of-concept and a demonstration of how capable Open source AI models are becoming. They aim to show that complex agentic workflows, which were once the domain of proprietary systems, can now be powered by open models running efficiently on standard cloud infrastructure. This aligns with Hugging Face’s broader mission to democratize AI. By releasing tools and models openly, they encourage experimentation, development, and improvement within the community, pushing the boundaries of what open AI can achieve in areas like computer interaction and automation. The Growing Market for Agentic AI Technology Despite the current limitations of tools like Open Computer Agent, the underlying Agentic AI technology is attracting considerable interest and investment across various industries. Enterprises are increasingly exploring how AI agents can boost productivity by automating repetitive digital tasks, handling customer interactions, or processing information more efficiently. According to a KPMG survey, approximately 65% of companies are already experimenting with AI agents. Market projections further underscore this trend, with Markets and Markets estimating the AI agent segment to grow significantly, from $7.84 billion in 2025 to a projected $52.62 billion by 2030. This indicates strong confidence in the future potential of AI agents to transform workflows and create value. Conclusion: A Promising Step for Open AI Hugging Face’s release of Open Computer Agent is a noteworthy event for the open source AI community and anyone interested in the future of computer automation . While the tool is currently limited by sluggishness, occasional errors, and the inability to handle certain web elements like CAPTCHAs, its existence demonstrates the increasing power and versatility of open AI models. It provides a tangible example of how AI is moving beyond generating text or images to actively interacting with digital environments. As vision models and agentic frameworks continue to improve, the capabilities of tools like Open Computer Agent are expected to grow, paving the way for more sophisticated and reliable AI-powered computer control and automation in the future.

The latest edition highlights a six-day streak of gains in risk-on assets, driven by encouraging signals around potential US trade deals. The report provides in-depth analysis of macroeconomic indicators, spot market activity, and derivative trends across futures, perpetual contracts, and options. It reflects a market lifted by renewed confidence, yet still navigating recent volatility and heightened risk awareness. Key highlights: Perp at Multi-Month High; Traders Remain Cautious After surging from $75,000 to over $95,000 in early April, Bitcoin has been trading sideways near $94,000 this week. Open interest has remained steady for April, hovering near all-time highs at $8 billion, while daily trade volumes have declined to $10 billion. Lower volumes have coincided with reduced realized volatility. Perpetual futures positioning suggests that traders are holding off on major bets, potentially awaiting the next breakout while remaining wary of recent sell-offs. Bitcoin Volatility Drops to 18-Month Low Bitcoin’s volatility has declined toward a key support zone between 35% and 40%—a range from which it has repeatedly rebounded over the past 18 months. Implied volatility has followed suit, dipping in line with a 10-point drop in realized volatility to just above 30%, the lower bound of its 18-month range. Options flows currently show a preference for puts, while the spot price remains stable. The volatility smile skews toward out-of-the-money (OTM) calls for longer-dated options, whereas short-dated options are close to neutral. BTC Volatility Smile Tilts Toward OTM Calls Bitcoin’s volatility smile now favors out-of-the-money (OTM) calls across all tenors, marking a reversal from the put-heavy skew seen earlier in April. Ether shows a similar short-term recovery, although longer-dated skew for ETH remains modestly bearish. Despite positive funding rates for ETH, longer-dated option smiles still lean toward puts, indicating mixed sentiment. In contrast, BTC derivatives markets reflect stronger bullish signals, including positive funding rate spikes, upward-sloping futures curves, and a renewed skew toward OTM calls.

Today’s jump added almost $4,000 to BTC prices in around 12 hours, but the move could not be sustained as the asset fell back to $96,500 at the time of writing. Nevertheless, Bitcoin remains up 2.3% on the day, and sentiment appears to be improving despite the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision on May 7. US-China Trade Talks The move appears to have been driven by the United States and China reportedly planning high-level trade talks in Switzerland over the weekend. Late Tuesday, May 6, China and the US announced plans for trade talks between Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Geneva, reported the Associated Press on May 7. “Thanks to POTUS, the world has been coming to the US, and China has been the missing piece—we will meet on Saturday and Sunday to discuss our shared interests,” said Bessent on X. He added that the current tariffs and trade barriers are “unsustainable,” but we don’t want to “decouple,” we want fair trade. Thanks to @POTUS , the world has been coming to the US, and China has been the missing piece—we will meet on Saturday and Sunday to discuss our shared interests.

What we want is fair trade. pic.twitter.com/MYc4XvqME8 — Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent (@SecScottBessent) May 6, 2025 The Chinese Commerce Ministry confirmed the trade talks between its vice premier and Bessent in Switzerland. “The Chinese side carefully evaluated the information from the US side and decided to agree to have contact with the US side after fully considering global expectations, Chinese interests, and calls from US businesses and consumers,” said a ministry spokesperson. Wendy Cutler, a former US trade official, said it is an “important opportunity to have initial talks on unwinding some tariffs, mapping out a path forward, as well as raising concerns,” cautioning that the process will take time. The meeting comes amid growing US market concern over the impact of the trade tariffs on the prices and supply of consumer goods. Consumers are hurt the most when import tariffs are imposed as the price of goods escalates, adding to economic woes and recession fears. Elsewhere on Crypto Markets Bitcoin and crypto markets have also been boosted by a weakening US dollar as the currency devaluation has accelerated over the past week or so. However, crypto market cap remains flat on the day at $3.08 trillion despite Bitcoin’s gains. Ethereum climbed to an intraday high of $1,845, but it still faces heavy resistance at this level that it has not been able to overcome in the past fortnight. The altcoins were seeing minor gains, with slightly better performance from Cardano, Chainlink, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin , which jumped 10%.

However, recent data surrounding the TRUMP token , a meme coin linked to former President Donald Trump, highlights a particularly stark reality for many investors. While a select few have reaped immense rewards, the vast majority are currently underwater on their investments. Understanding the TRUMP Token Phenomenon The TRUMP token ($TRUMP) emerged as part of the politically-themed meme coin trend. These tokens often gain traction based on social media hype, celebrity endorsements (or associations), and speculative trading rather than underlying technology or utility. While this can lead to explosive price pumps, it also means they are highly susceptible to sudden crashes and manipulation. The Stark Reality: Crypto Losses for the Majority Data shared by blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis paints a clear, albeit grim, picture for holders of the TRUMP token . According to their findings, over 760,000 unique wallets holding the token are currently sitting on unrealized losses. This means the price they acquired the token at is higher than its current market value. Over 760,000 Wallets: A vast number of individual investors are experiencing losses. Majority are Small Investors: The bulk of these losing wallets belong to those who likely invested smaller amounts. Unrealized vs. Realized Losses: These are ‘paper losses’ for now, but become real if the investors sell at the current price. This situation is not entirely uncommon in volatile markets, but the sheer scale of wallets in the red underscores the significant risk associated with tokens driven primarily by speculation and sentiment. Who’s Winning? The Rise of Crypto Whales In stark contrast to the hundreds of thousands of losing wallets, a tiny fraction of holders have seen extraordinary gains. The Chainalysis data revealed that just 58 wallets have each gained over $10 million from their TRUMP token holdings. These large holders, often referred to as crypto whales , typically got in very early – perhaps even at the token’s inception – or made significant purchases during low points. Their ability to hold large positions and potentially influence market movements gives them a distinct advantage in volatile meme coin markets. The disparity between the many small losers and the few large winners is a classic characteristic of speculative bubbles, where early participants and those with significant capital can benefit disproportionately. Why Meme Coin Investment is High-Risk The story of the TRUMP token serves as a potent case study for the inherent risks of meme coin investment . Here’s why these assets are particularly perilous: Extreme Volatility: Prices can skyrocket or plummet based on social media trends, news, or even single large trades. Lack of Intrinsic Value: Unlike cryptocurrencies with technological utility (like Ethereum) or perceived store-of-value properties (like Bitcoin), meme coins’ value is almost entirely based on community hype and speculation. Pump-and-Dump Potential: Large holders or groups can coordinate to artificially inflate the price (‘pump’) and then sell off their holdings rapidly (‘dump’), leaving later investors with worthless tokens. Regulatory Uncertainty: The lack of clear regulation around meme coins makes them fertile ground for scams and manipulation, and investors have little recourse if things go wrong. Insider Advantages: As seen with the TRUMP token, wallets potentially tied to the project’s creators or early insiders can benefit from fees or pre-mine allocations, adding another layer of risk for retail investors. Navigating Meme Coin Risks : Actionable Insights Given the significant meme coin risks , what should potential investors consider? It’s crucial to approach these assets with extreme caution and a clear understanding of the potential downsides. Actionable Insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Understand what you are investing in. For meme coins, this means understanding the community, the tokenomics (how the token is distributed and used), and checking for red flags like highly concentrated ownership. Assume You Could Lose Everything: Only invest what you can comfortably afford to lose. Meme coins are not suitable for capital preservation or reliable growth. Be Wary of Hype: Don’t get swept up in social media frenzy or celebrity endorsements. Look critically at the data and the underlying reality. Understand Tokenomics: Be aware if a large percentage of the supply is held by a few wallets or if insiders benefit significantly from transaction fees or pre-allocations, as this can indicate potential manipulation or unfair advantages. Diversify (Carefully): If you choose to dabble in meme coins, make them a tiny, insignificant part of a much larger, diversified crypto portfolio. Consider Regulatory Scrutiny: Be aware that tokens facing regulatory attention may encounter issues that negatively impact their price or accessibility. The fact that insider wallets tied to the TRUMP token project continue to earn millions in fees, even as most token supply is reportedly locked or held by losing investors, adds a layer of concern and highlights the potential for models that benefit creators over community members. Summary: A Cautionary Tale of Meme Coin Investment The Chainalysis data on the TRUMP token provides a stark illustration of the potential pitfalls in the speculative corners of the crypto market. While a small group of crypto whales have achieved remarkable gains, the overwhelming majority of investors are facing substantial crypto losses . This scenario is a powerful reminder of the inherent meme coin risks , including extreme volatility, lack of fundamental value, and potential for insider advantages. For anyone considering meme coin investment , the data from the TRUMP token should serve as a crucial warning.

Meanwhile, controversy is mounting at the federal level, with President Trump facing bipartisan backlash over his personal involvement in cryptocurrency, including his TRUMP meme coin and a planned gala for major holders. The situation intensified political divisions in Congress, and also stalled crypto legislation as Democrats and Republicans clash over ethics, regulation, and the president’s financial ties to the crypto industry. New Hampshire Takes the Lead in Crypto Adoption New Hampshire officially became the first US state to authorize government investment in cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, after the signing of House Bill 302 into law by Governor Kelly Ayotte. The bill was introduced in January and passed by both chambers of the state legislature. It allows the state treasury to allocate funds into cryptocurrencies and precious metals. However, the legislation limits these investments to digital assets with a market capitalization of more than $500 billion, which effectively narrows the scope to major players like Bitcoin and Ethereum while excluding most smaller tokens and meme coins. Governor Ayotte announced the move on social media on May 6, which signals a new era for state-level crypto adoption. The state’s Republican leadership praised the bill by stating that New Hampshire is setting the pace for integrating digital assets into public financial strategy. The decision puts the ”Live Free or Die” state at the forefront of a growing movement among US states to explore the creation of strategic crypto reserves. This development happened during broader national discussions about the role of cryptocurrency in government financial planning. At the federal level, President Donald Trump issued an executive order earlier this year to establish a “Digital Asset Stockpile” and a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.” Meanwhile, Senator Cynthia Lummis proposed the BITCOIN Act, which suggests that the US government could accumulate over 1 million BTC through seizures tied to criminal and civil forfeiture. The bill is currently under review by the Senate Banking Committee. New Hampshire’s proactive legislation sets it apart from other states that attempted similar moves but failed to secure executive approval. Arizona, for example, passed a similar bill in April, only for it to be vetoed by Governor Katie Hobbs on May 2. Florida also dropped two legislative efforts related to creating a Bitcoin reserve just a day later. As a result, New Hampshire now stands alone in officially embracing crypto as a treasury asset. Crypto Sparks Congressional Clash Although one state is making strides when it comes to embracing crypto, the same cannot be said for the whole of the US. A joint hearing on digital assets in the US House was thrown into political turmoil on May 6 when Representative Maxine Waters, ranking member of the House Financial Services Committee (HFSC), led a group of Democratic lawmakers in walking out. Waters denounced what she called “the corruption of the President of the United States” in relation to cryptocurrency, and called President Donald Trump’s personal crypto holdings and involvement in the industry a serious conflict of interest. Despite her objections, Republican lawmakers, led by digital asset subcommittee Chair Bryan Steil, continued the session by classifying it as a “roundtable,” and skirting certain committee rules that may have otherwise stopped the proceeding. HFSC Chair French Hill urged lawmakers to press ahead with developing a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets, but avoided directly addressing concerns about Trump’s alleged financial entanglements. Waters’ protest was part of a broader strategy that was announced the day prior, which reflects the rising tension over the president’s actions that include launching a meme coin, offering exclusive dinners to major token holders, and maintaining family connections to the crypto firm World Liberty Financial. As Republicans advanced their proposed crypto market structure bill during the roundtable, Democrats held a separate “shadow hearing” where they unveiled draft legislation that would ban the president, vice president, members of Congress, and their immediate families from owning or profiting from cryptocurrencies. The bill will also ban these officials from leading digital asset projects or accepting crypto-based compensation. Legislation proposed by Democrats (Source: House Financial Services Committee Democrats ) The increasingly partisan divide threatens to stall progress on digital asset legislation, including a Senate stablecoin bill that recently lost Democratic support due to allegations of presidential impropriety. Even some Republicans, like Senator Cynthia Lummis and Senator Lisa Murkowski, criticized the Trump family’s involvement in the crypto sector, and Congressman Hill admitted it complicates the path forward for regulation. TRUMP Coin Gala Causes Bipartisan Outrage US President Donald Trump is also facing growing bipartisan backlash over plans to host a gala dinner for top holders of his TRUMP meme coin. On May 5, Trump announced via Truth Social that the dinner will take place on May 22, which only intensified concerns among lawmakers about conflicts of interest and potential corruption. Critics argue that Trump is effectively offering exclusive presidential access in exchange for investment in a digital asset that is tied to his personal brand and business interests. (Source: Truth Social ) Several Democratic lawmakers, including Senators Elizabeth Warren, Adam Schiff, and Jon Ossoff, publicly condemned the initiative. Schiff and Warren co-signed a letter accusing the president of selling privileged access, while Ossoff suggested at a recent town hall that the plan constituted an impeachable offense. Republican lawmakers have not been silent either. Senator Cynthia Lummis also voiced her discomfort with the president using the White House as an incentive for crypto investors. She called the arrangement troubling, even as a supporter of digital assets. To complicate the situation even more is a recent international deal involving a Trump-backed stablecoin, USD1. On May 1, Abu Dhabi-based firm MGX used USD1 to settle a $2 billion investment into Binance. The stablecoin’s market cap surged from roughly $137 million to over $2 billion in 24 hours. Senator Warren called this a “shady crypto deal” with the United Arab Emirates and warned of the national security implications. She called on the Senate to pause all pro-crypto legislation in light of the potential for foreign financial influence over the president. Legal experts are still divided on whether Trump’s actions are actually in violation of any existing statutes. Niko Demchuk from AMLBot pointed out the need for clearer disclosure and conflict-of-interest rules to prevent misuse of digital assets by public officials, while Yarden Noy from DLT Law stated that current regulations may not apply to Trump’s dealings. Noy also pointed to the constitutional prohibition on emoluments, though its applicability in this case is very uncertain. Trump’s conflicting remarks on whether he profited from the TRUMP meme coin only added to the scrutiny. In a clip that was circulated by Warren, Trump seems evasive about his financial involvement by claiming not to have even looked at whether he has profited.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-07 05:27:57

Bitwise has filed to list a spot Near ETF in the US, while 21Shares has launched a Cronos ETP on European exchanges. Bitwise Files for Spot Near ETF, Expanding the SEC’s Growing Altcoin Docket In a May 6 filing , Bitwise outlined its intention to launch the Bitwise Near ETF, which would directly track the price of the NEAR token — the native asset of the Near blockchain network. The fund, structured as a trust, aims to offer exposure to NEAR through a conventional brokerage account, minus fund expenses. Coinbase Custody Trust Company is listed as the proposed custodian for the ETF. Details such as the ETF’s ticker symbol, management fee, and preferred stock exchange have not yet been disclosed. Bitwise’s preliminary filing does not mark the beginning of the SEC’s official review. The company must still submit a 19b-4 form, which will trigger the regulatory countdown and pave the way for a potential decision. Bitwise signaled its intention to move forward with the trust when it registered the fund in Delaware on April 28. Bitwise’s move brings NEAR into an increasingly competitive field of altcoin ETF contenders. The SEC is currently sitting on more than a dozen spot crypto ETF applications for various assets including Litecoin (LTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), Solana (SOL), XRP, Cardano (ADA), Hedera (HBAR), Polkadot (DOT), Chainlink (LINK), Avalanche (AVAX), Aptos (APT), and Sui (SUI). Bitwise itself has filed for spot ETFs tied to DOGE, SOL, and XRP, on top of its already approved Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) spot ETFs, which are listed on NYSE Arca. Since their launch, those flagship funds have collectively attracted $2.35 billion in net inflows, underlining strong institutional and retail demand for regulated crypto exposure. Why Near? Launched in 2020, the Near blockchain was initially hailed as a potential ”Ethereum killer” due to its unique approach to scalability and efficiency. The NEAR token, currently trading around $2.31, powers the layer-1 blockchain and sits at 44th by market cap with a total valuation of approximately $2.73 billion, according to CoinGecko . NEAR price chart (Source: CoinGecko) Near’s claim to fame is its Nightshade sharding architecture, which allows it to process up to 100,000 transactions per second while maintaining low fees and high security. The network is currently maintained by 265 active validators, according to NearBlocks . While Near once focused heavily on decentralized finance (DeFi), the project pivoted in 2024 toward AI infrastructure, with ambitions to build the world’s largest open-source large language model (LLM). This strategic shift aims to position Near as a major player in the convergence of AI and blockchain — two of the fastest-growing sectors in tech. Regulatory Outlook Despite the surge in ETF filings, the SEC has yet to approve any spot ETF for assets outside of Bitcoin and Ether . However, industry analysts view the wave of applications as a sign of growing maturity and demand in the crypto market. While approval timelines remain uncertain, ETF issuers are hoping that the SEC’s greenlighting of Bitcoin and Ethereum products sets a precedent for broader altcoin inclusion. The flood of new applications also signals a deeper philosophical shift within the crypto industry: from speculative assets to regulated investment products, with traditional structures designed to meet institutional compliance standards. 21Shares Launches Cronos ETP in Europe as Altcoin Investment Demand Grows In related news, Swiss-based asset manager 21Shares has introduced a new exchange-traded product (ETP) offering investors regulated exposure to the Cronos (CRO) token, the native asset of the Crypto.com-affiliated blockchain network. The Cronos ETP, announced by 21Shares on May 6, is now available for trading on Euronext Paris and Amsterdam, marking the latest move by the asset manager to expand its European product suite. With this launch, investors can gain exposure to CRO through traditional brokerage platforms and banks — removing the technical barriers of managing crypto wallets or accessing digital asset exchanges. CRO is the native token of the Cronos Chain, a layer-1 blockchain built by Crypto.com and positioned to integrate Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems. It is designed to power applications in decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and broader Web3 infrastructure. According to 21Shares, the ETP will allow institutional and retail investors to participate in the growth of Cronos without directly handling digital assets. ”By launching a Cronos ETP, we are offering investors safe, regulated exposure to a blockchain ecosystem that is driving real-world adoption,” said Mandy Chiu, Head of Financial Product Development at 21Shares. ”This product reflects our mission to bridge traditional finance and the crypto economy.” The ETP is fully collateralized by the underlying CRO tokens, which are securely held in institutional-grade custody solutions. 21Shares has not yet disclosed the product’s expense ratio or ticker symbol. Cronos: Fundamentals and DeFi Footprint The CRO token currently trades at around $0.092, with a market capitalization of $2.3 billion and a fully diluted valuation of nearly $8.7 billion, according to CoinMarketCap . While CRO once gained notoriety for its aggressive marketing via Crypto.com’s sports sponsorships, it has since turned toward ecosystem development and infrastructure. CRO price chart (Source: CoinMarketCap) The Cronos Chain boasts a total value locked (TVL) of approximately $400 million, per DeFiLlama data . Among its key DeFi components is Crypto.com Staked ETH (CETH) — a liquid staking product for Ethereum — which holds roughly $64 million in TVL. As a Cosmos SDK-based chain with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility, Cronos provides a dual advantage: high throughput and composability with the broader Ethereum landscape. This interoperability is central to Cronos’ ambition to become a leading multichain Web3 hub for consumer-facing applications. The launch of the Cronos ETP comes amid a broader trend of rising demand for altcoin-backed investment vehicles. Just a day prior, asset manager VanEck filed to list a BNB ETF in the US — the first proposed US ETF tied to Binance’s native token. In parallel, 21Shares has filed US ETF proposals for a range of altcoins including Dogecoin (DOGE), Polkadot (DOT), and Solana (SOL), seeking to capitalize on the shifting regulatory landscape under the Trump administration. Since January 2025, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has adopted a notably softer stance toward crypto ETFs , following the appointment of new leadership under the Trump presidency. As a result, asset managers are now pursuing regulatory approval for more than 70 crypto-linked ETFs, spanning both mainstream and niche tokens. European Momentum Builds Europe remains a key hub for crypto ETPs, offering a relatively friendlier regulatory environment compared to the US. Firms like 21Shares, ETC Group, and CoinShares have leveraged exchanges in Switzerland, Germany, France, and the Netherlands to offer wrapped exposure to everything from Bitcoin and Ether to more exotic tokens like Uniswap (UNI), Avalanche (AVAX), and now Cronos. The launch of the Cronos ETP may also serve as a signal that investor appetite for exchange-affiliated blockchains is expanding. With CRO, BNB, and other centralized exchange tokens entering the ETF/ETP pipeline, asset managers appear to be betting that these ecosystems — once criticized for their centralized roots — are becoming cornerstones of mainstream blockchain adoption.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|TRADING|CRO,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-07 05:30:00

The asset has dropped by 3% over the past week and 1.6% in the past 24 hours, continuing its broader corrective trend after reaching a cycle high of $4,107 in December 2024. Although price movement has been limited, on-chain data suggests that certain underlying shifts could influence market behavior in the near term. Related Reading: Ethereum Breaks Massive Downtrend Price Structure – Momentum Shift? Ethereum Sees Plunge In Spot Volume CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost has reported that Ethereum’s spot volume is experiencing a consistent decline. His analysis focuses on a bubble chart that visualizes two dimensions: the size of each bubble represents spot volume, and its color indicates the volume change rate. According to the data, the bubbles have become progressively smaller and lighter in color, indicating that fewer trades are being conducted and that the pace of decline in volume is slowing. While declining spot volume may traditionally be viewed as a sign of reduced investor interest or weak momentum, Darkfost interprets it differently in the context of a market correction. He suggests that a decline in spot volume during a downtrend can act as a stabilizing force, potentially reducing the likelihood of sharp volatility spikes caused by large sell orders. Lower volume during a corrective phase could mean that sellers are exhausting their positions or stepping aside, creating conditions for price consolidation. This can ease the intensity of downward pressure and potentially pave the way for a more balanced market structure in the short term. However, Darkfost was cautious in his interpretation, noting that cooling volume doesn’t necessarily mean the market has bottomed out. Instead, it could simply mark a temporary pause in volatility before the next move. Long-Term Holders Increase Exposure Despite Unrealized Losses Meanwhile, in a separate update, CryptoQuant analyst Carmelo Alemán explored Ethereum’s long-term holder behavior and revealed that many ETH investors continue to accumulate, even while sitting in unrealized losses. Accumulation addresses, defined as wallets that consistently receive ETH without significant selling, are generally seen as strong hands with longer investment horizons. According to Alemán, March 10 marked a pivotal moment when the average realized price of accumulation addresses fell below ETH’s market price, pushing these wallets into negative territory. Related Reading: Ethereum Holders Stay Committed Despite Unrealized Losses – Signs Of An Incoming Rally? Despite this, the data shows that accumulating addresses have increased their balances by over 22% between March and early May, growing from 15.5 million ETH to 19 million ETH. This behavior reflects strong conviction and suggests that long-term holders believe Ethereum is undervalued at current prices. Historically, such accumulation during downturns has preceded upward price movements, as reduced supply on the market creates favorable conditions for a rally when demand returns.

For now, XRP remains within a tight range between a key resistance and a critical support line. Recall the developments that took place a month ago when the entire crypto market plunged hard amid the escalating tensions on the Trade War front between the US and essentially the rest of the world. Fast-forward a month, and the political situation seems a lot better, with reports that the US and China plan to meet soon regarding the remaining tariffs. Naturally, crypto prices have reacted to all developments. A month ago, XRP plunged to $1.6 but now sits above $2.1. However, the TD Sequential on the 3-day scale hints at an upcoming correction. The metric, used to showcase an asset’s exhaustion in either direction, has flashed a sell signal, according to popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez. $XRP could be due for a retracement, with the TD Sequential flashing a sell signal on the 3-day chart! pic.twitter.com/onZCDJTusd — Ali (@ali_charts) May 7, 2025 Despite the brief slip below $2 a month ago, XRP has remained predominantly above that level. While some analysts believe that such a price is an ‘absolute gift,’ Martinez has highlighted multiple times how important it is for $2 to remain as support instead of turning into resistance if XRP slips below it. In a separate post today, the analyst with over 135,000 followers on X also outlined the upper boundary in XRP’s current trading range – $2.26. The asset currently sits roughly in the middle of the two lines ($2.14), with no clear indication of the next big move. Martinez said more clarity will come whenever XRP decisively closes below $2 or above $2.26. Key levels to watch for $XRP are $2 and $2.26. A decisive close outside this range could set the tone for the next major trend. pic.twitter.com/GvBd4bFdjj — Ali (@ali_charts) May 6, 2025 The post Critical Warning for Ripple’s (XRP) Price After 30% Monthly Surge: Details appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|XRPBTC|XRPUSD|Ripple (XRP) Price,EN,0,0,ASIA|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-05-07 05:43:52

The announcement came via the company’s X account early Tuesday, stating that “Movement Labs has terminated Rushi Manche’s employment and all affiliations with the company effective immediately.” It has yet to name a replacement or outline next steps for governance restructuring. The decision follows a CoinDesk report that first revealed secret agreements between Movement-linked entities and market makers during the project’s token launch. CoinDesk reported the existence of shadow advisors, hidden payment flows, and undisclosed token allocations surrounding MOVE’s debut. Manche was directly tied to those arrangements, according to internal documents and investor correspondence reviewed by CoinDesk. Manche was initially suspended on May 2, shortly after Coinbase delisted the MOVE token. The delisting followed mounting community pressure on how the company operates behind-the-scenes and project governance. MOVE prices are down 8.5% in the past 24 hours, a bulk of the slide coming after Manche’s termination.

Ethereum schedules Prague fork containing several EIPs Ethereum previously announced that the Prague fork was also scheduled to occur on the mainnet at block timestamp ‘Wed May 07 10:05:11 2025 UTC’. The fork will contain several EIPs, including EIP-2537, which will add operation on the BLS12-381 curve as a precompile in a set necessary to efficiently perform operations such as BLS signature verification. EIP-2935 will store and serve the last 8191 block hashes as storage slots of a system contract to allow for stateless execution. At the same time, EIP-6110 will provide validator deposits as a list of deposit operations added to the Execution Layer block, and EIP-7002 will allow validators to trigger exits and partial withdrawals via their execution layer (0x01) withdrawal credentials. EIP-7251 will also increase the MAX_EFFECTIVE_BALANCE, allowing validators to have larger effective balances while maintaining the 32 ETH lower bound. EIP-7549 will move the committee index outside the ‘signed attestation message,’ and EIP-7623 will increase call data cost to reduce maximum block size. EIP-7685 will include a general-purpose bus for sharing execution layer (EL) triggered requests with the consensus layer (CL), and EIP-7691 will increase the number of blobs to reach a new target and max of 6 and 9 blobs per block, respectively. Also, EIP-7702 will add a new tx type to permanently set the code for an EOA, while EIP-7840 will include per-fork blob parameters in client configuration files. Notably, transaction-sending RPCs will now add txs to the ‘locals’ tracker only when they have any chance of inclusion, which will be a bit of a revert from the behavior added in ‘Multicapacitor v1.15.4’–where APIs such as ‘eth_sendRawTransaction’ would always return a txhash, even if the transaction was not includable on-chain.

This development underscores the growing intersection between prominent political figures and the evolving landscape of crypto finance. What Trump Crypto Assets Were Involved? According to on-chain analysis by Spot On Chain, World Liberty Financial moved approximately $4.51 million worth of various crypto tokens. The transfer, completed within a 45-minute window, involved three distinct cryptocurrencies: AVAX: 103,911 tokens, valued at approximately $2.06 million at the time of transfer. MOVE: 7.58 million tokens, valued at roughly $1.27 million. SEI: 5.98 million tokens, valued at about $1.18 million. This diverse portfolio move highlights activity beyond just the major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, indicating engagement with a broader range of altcoins. Where Did World Liberty Financial Send the Funds? The transferred assets were sent to a new wallet address. While the exact ultimate destination is not definitively confirmed, analysis suggests the funds are likely heading towards Ceffu. Ceffu is an institutional-grade custody solution affiliated with Binance, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. Moving funds to an institutional custodian like Ceffu often signals a strategic decision related to security, management, or preparing for potential future transactions or services that require secure, compliant storage. Understanding the AVAX, MOVE, and SEI PnL On-chain data also provides insight into the unrealized Profit and Loss (PnL) associated with these specific holdings prior to the transfer. The results were mixed, illustrating the volatile nature of crypto investments: Unrealized PnL Breakdown: Asset Unrealized PnL AVAX +$69,900 MOVE -$2.45 million SEI +$196,000 While the AVAX and SEI holdings showed modest unrealized gains, the MOVE position represented a significant unrealized loss. It’s important to note that these figures represent unrealized PnL at the time of the transfer; the actual profit or loss would only be realized if the assets were sold. Why Does This Crypto Transfer Matter? This transaction is noteworthy for several reasons: Political Figure Involvement: It provides further evidence of direct or indirect involvement of entities linked to prominent political figures like Donald Trump in the cryptocurrency space. Institutional Adoption Signal: The potential move to Ceffu suggests a preference for institutional-level security and custody solutions, which is often seen as a step towards more mature and secure management of digital assets. Portfolio Insight: The specific tokens moved (AVAX, MOVE, SEI) offer a glimpse into the types of assets held by World Liberty Financial, going beyond just the most common cryptocurrencies. Market Interest: Any significant crypto movement tied to a high-profile name generates considerable interest and speculation within the crypto community. While the exact reasons behind this specific transfer remain undisclosed, moving a substantial amount of assets to a new, likely institutional wallet, is a significant operational step. It could be related to portfolio restructuring, enhanced security measures, or preparation for future strategic actions involving these digital assets. Conclusion: A Glimpse into High-Profile Crypto Holdings The $4.5 million crypto transfer by Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial involving AVAX, MOVE, and SEI tokens to a new wallet, potentially destined for Ceffu, offers a fascinating insight into the digital asset activities of entities connected to high-profile figures. The mixed unrealized PnL figures highlight the inherent volatility of the market, even for large holdings. This event serves as another data point demonstrating the increasing presence and strategic asset management within the cryptocurrency ecosystem by a diverse range of participants, including those with ties to traditional political and financial spheres.

Here’s What the Math Says appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News There’s a lot of talk online about XRP possibly reaching huge price levels like $100, $500, or even $1,000. While that might sound far-fetched at first, some real-world use cases and numbers suggest it may not be so crazy after all. An X (formerly Twitter) account by the name Stellar Rippler pointed out that XRP was designed to handle fast, low-cost cross-border payments—something the current SWIFT system handles at a rate of about $5 trillion per day. If XRP eventually takes over even 10% of SWIFT’s volume, that’s $500 billion daily. With that kind of flow, XRP’s price could climb to somewhere between $27 and $50. Another scenario is around Nostro and Vostro accounts, where banks keep about $27 trillion locked up just to settle international payments. If XRP can replace even 5% of this, it could unlock a huge amount of capital, possibly pushing XRP’s price to $80–$100. Then there’s the possibility that Ripple becomes a licensed bank. If that happens, it could offer lending, custody, and payment services directly—using XRP as its backbone. That kind of shift could easily push XRP over $100. (9/ ) Bitcoin went from pennies to $100K+ on narrative alone. No partnerships. No institutional rails. Just belief. XRP has real-world utility, banking ties, regulatory positioning, and tech light-years ahead… And people still think $10+ is a dream? It’s not a question of if -… pic.twitter.com/gabvDd5sae — Stellar Rippler (@StellarNews007) May 6, 2025 Ripple is also already working with more than 40 central banks. If XRP becomes the main bridge currency for central banks, big financial groups like the IMF or World Bank might rely on it. If that happens, XRP could climb to the $250–$500 range. And then there’s the global derivatives market, which is worth over $1 quadrillion. If even a tiny slice—just 0.1%—gets settled through XRP’s network, the price could go over $1,000. That’s no longer just a dream, but a possible future built on utility. So why isn’t XRP there yet? Legal challenges, regulation delays, and market uncertainty have held it back. But if these barriers clear, the change could happen fast. Bitcoin hit massive prices like $100, 000 based purely on belief.

A significant meeting is on the horizon that could signal shifts in the Global Economic System and potentially influence the future landscape for digital assets. Understanding the Importance of the US Treasury Secretary’s Visit On May 8, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is set to embark on a visit to Switzerland. This trip is far from a mere formality. According to official sources, Secretary Bessent will engage in crucial talks with Swiss President Karin Ketter-Sutter and a senior Chinese economic official. The stated objective? To discuss the complex process of rebalancing the global economic system, aligning it more closely with U.S. interests. Why is this meeting particularly noteworthy for those tracking the crypto space? Because the ‘global economic system’ increasingly intersects with digital finance. Discussions around international trade, capital flows, currency stability, and financial regulation at this level inevitably touch upon the role of cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). What Does ‘Rebalancing the Global Economic System’ Mean in This Context? The phrase ‘rebalancing the global economic system’ is broad, but it typically encompasses several key areas: Trade Imbalances: Addressing deficits and surpluses between major economies. Currency Valuations: Discussing exchange rates and potential currency manipulation concerns. Supply Chain Resilience: Rethinking global production and distribution networks. International Financial Architecture: Examining the roles of institutions like the IMF and World Bank, and the future of cross-border payments. Regulatory Harmonization (or lack thereof): How different countries approach financial oversight, which is highly relevant to Crypto Regulation . From the U.S. perspective, ‘in line with U.S. interests’ could mean advocating for fairer trade practices, ensuring financial stability that doesn’t undermine the dollar’s global standing, and promoting regulatory environments that align with American standards, including those being developed for digital assets. The Key Players: US, Switzerland, and China The choice of participants and location is strategic: The United States: As the world’s largest economy and home to significant financial innovation and markets (including a major crypto ecosystem), the U.S. plays a central role in shaping global economic norms and regulations. The US Treasury Secretary is a key figure in articulating and implementing U.S. financial policy abroad. Switzerland: A long-standing hub for international finance and diplomacy, Switzerland has also emerged as a relatively crypto-friendly jurisdiction, particularly for blockchain technology and specific types of digital assets. Its neutral stance and financial expertise make it an ideal meeting ground for sensitive international discussions. Switzerland Finance is deeply intertwined with global capital markets. China: A rapidly growing economic superpower with its own ambitions for the global financial system, including the development and potential internationalization of its digital yuan (e-CNY). US-China Economic Talks are critical for managing competition and finding areas of cooperation on issues ranging from trade to technology and finance. Bringing these three together in Switzerland underscores the complexity and interconnectedness of today’s global economic challenges. It’s a trilateral format that allows for both bilateral discussions (US-Swiss, US-China) and potentially broader conversations about shared concerns or differing approaches. How Could These Talks Impact Crypto Regulation and the Digital Asset Space? While the official agenda focuses on broader economic themes, the discussions could easily spill over into the realm of digital assets in several ways: Will Crypto Regulation Be on the Agenda? Given the increasing global focus on establishing clear rules for cryptocurrencies and related services, it’s highly probable that Crypto Regulation will be an implicit, if not explicit, topic. The U.S. is actively working on its own regulatory framework, while China has taken a different approach involving strict controls. Switzerland has carved out its own path. Harmonizing approaches or understanding differing regulatory philosophies is crucial for preventing regulatory arbitrage and ensuring financial stability across borders. Cross-Border Payments and CBDCs Rebalancing the global system involves improving cross-border transactions. This is an area where both private cryptocurrencies and state-backed CBDCs could play a role. Discussions might touch upon: The efficiency and cost of current international payment systems. The potential impact of CBDCs (like China’s e-CNY or potential future digital dollars/francs) on global currency dynamics. The use of digital assets for remittances and trade finance. The U.S. has expressed caution regarding a digital dollar but is actively researching the concept, while China is a frontrunner. Switzerland is also exploring digital forms of its currency. These talks could provide insights into how these major players view the future of digital money in international finance. Financial Stability and Risk Assessment Global economic stability is paramount. As the crypto market grows, its potential impact on traditional finance becomes a greater point of discussion among regulators and policymakers. The meeting could involve sharing perspectives on: Assessing risks posed by volatile crypto markets. Ensuring consumer and investor protection. Combating illicit finance using digital assets. These are concerns shared by the US Treasury Secretary and his counterparts globally. Potential Benefits and Challenges from These High-Level Discussions Such meetings offer potential benefits but also highlight significant challenges: Potential Benefits: Increased Clarity: Dialogue can lead to a better understanding of different countries’ stances on digital assets. Potential for Coordination: While full harmonization is unlikely, talks could identify areas for potential cooperation on standards or information sharing regarding Crypto Regulation . Risk Mitigation: Sharing assessments of risks related to digital assets could lead to more informed policy decisions globally. Improved Cross-Border Dialogue: Laying groundwork for more efficient and secure international financial interactions, potentially involving digital technologies. Challenges: Conflicting National Interests: The U.S., China, and Switzerland have different economic priorities and regulatory philosophies, particularly concerning capital controls and data privacy, which impact digital asset approaches. Pace of Innovation vs. Regulation: Technology moves faster than policy, making it difficult for regulators to keep up and coordinate effectively. Defining ‘Rebalancing’: Reaching a consensus on what a ‘balanced’ global economic system looks like, and whose interests should prevail, is inherently difficult. The Role of Non-State Actors: Discussions between governments don’t always fully capture the dynamics of decentralized technologies and private sector innovation in the crypto space. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community What should those in the crypto space take away from this upcoming meeting? While direct, immediate policy changes are unlikely to be announced from these high-level talks, they are indicative of the direction global economic policy is heading. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Official Statements: Keep an eye on any official readouts or press conferences following the meetings. Look for mentions of digital currencies, cross-border payments, or financial stability concerns that touch upon crypto. Understand Regulatory Trends: These discussions are part of a broader global trend towards increased Crypto Regulation . Stay informed about proposed rules in major jurisdictions like the U.S., EU, and potentially how countries like Switzerland and China are refining their approaches. Analyze Geopolitical Signals: The state of US-China Economic Talks significantly influences global markets, including crypto. Any signs of cooperation or tension could have market implications. Watch for CBDC Developments: Pay attention to how major economies discuss CBDCs internationally. Their design and interoperability (or lack thereof) will impact the future of international finance and the role of private digital currencies. Consider Switzerland’s Role: Switzerland Finance has a unique position. Observe how its regulatory stance evolves in light of international pressure and its own strategic goals in the digital asset space. These high-level meetings serve as a barometer for the evolving global financial landscape. They highlight that digital assets are no longer a fringe topic but are increasingly relevant in discussions about international finance, economic stability, and national interests. Conclusion: A Glimpse into the Future of Global Finance The upcoming visit by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to Switzerland for talks with Swiss and Chinese officials represents a crucial moment in ongoing efforts to navigate and potentially reshape the Global Economic System . While the primary focus is broad economic rebalancing, the interconnectedness of modern finance means that topics like Crypto Regulation , cross-border digital payments, and the future role of digital currencies are likely to be part of the conversation, either directly or indirectly. The outcomes of such discussions, even if not immediately public, will contribute to the complex web of international relations and regulatory approaches that ultimately shape the environment for digital assets worldwide. Staying informed about these high-level dialogues is essential for anyone seeking to understand the forces influencing the future of finance.

He believes that speculation season and sideways trading will end once the U.S. Treasury announces its use of XRP. He believes this development will bring the utility-driven bull run, and these remarks come amid new federal actions that could align with the broader use of digital assets, including XRP. When the U.S. Treasury announces they’re using $XRP Say goodbye to XRP speculation season. Say hello to XRP real utility bullrun. — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) May 5, 2025 Trump Administration’s Strategic Move Toward Digital Payments Shortly after inauguration, President Donald Trump shocked the market by announcing a strategic U.S. crypto reserve . Notably, the president named XRP in the official announcement on Truth Social, stirring excitement in the community. This move affirmed his commitment to the growth of the crypto industry, and he has followed it up with targeted executive orders to help the market grow. He recently signed an executive order to overhaul the U.S. Treasury’s payment systems . The directive seeks to replace inefficient, paper-based methods with secure digital transactions. The goal of the administration is to combat fraud, reduce waste, and streamline federal disbursements by integrating modern payment technologies. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The executive order shows a growing federal interest in incorporating digital solutions into the financial infrastructure. Enhancing transparency and improving security are central themes of the plan. As Farina implies, if XRP is selected for any portion of this modernization, speculation about its long-term viability may give way to confirmed institutional utility. Will the U.S. Treasury Adopt Cryptocurrencies? The appointment of Scott Bessent as Treasury Secretary adds further weight to this narrative. Bessent is known for his view that digital assets play a key role in U.S. financial competitiveness. His leadership is expected to drive policies integrating blockchain technology into national economic strategies. This shift in tone at the Treasury Department aligns with Farina’s comments, which frame XRP not as a speculative asset but a tool for national and institutional-level use. Utility May Define XRP’s Next Phase The convergence of governmental interest and potential institutional adoption marks a transition for XRP. Farina’s statement highlights this potential shift from market speculation, and many experts share this belief that utility will help XRP grow . While there has been no official confirmation of XRP’s inclusion in Treasury operations, ongoing signals suggest that such an outcome is no longer out of reach. If realized, it could position XRP at the center of a broader utility-driven bull market, validating Farina’s assertion and opening a new chapter in its role within U.S. financial systems.

Specifically, two prominent senators are pushing for new rules regarding digital asset ownership for federal officials, while also launching a pointed inquiry into a particular asset: the TRUMP meme coin. This move underscores growing concerns about conflicts of interest and transparency in the digital age, particularly as high-profile political figures become linked, directly or indirectly, to volatile digital assets. Why Are US Senators Targeting Crypto Holdings? Senators Chris Murphy (D-CT) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) have stepped forward with a significant legislative proposal. Their bill aims to prohibit federal officials from profiting from the trading or holding of digital assets. This isn’t the first time lawmakers have considered restrictions on financial holdings for public servants, but it marks a direct focus on the burgeoning world of cryptocurrencies. The rationale behind such a crypto regulation bill is rooted in the principle of public trust. Federal officials are privy to information and make decisions that can significantly impact various markets, including the rapidly evolving digital asset space. Owning or trading assets that could be affected by their actions or knowledge creates a potential for conflicts of interest crypto, where personal financial gain could improperly influence official duties. Think about it: If an official owns a substantial amount of a particular cryptocurrency, and they are involved in drafting legislation or regulations that could boost or tank its value, there’s an inherent conflict. This bill seeks to remove that temptation and ensure that officials are acting solely in the public interest, not their own portfolios. Key aspects of the proposed bill likely include: A clear definition of what constitutes a “digital asset” or “cryptocurrency.” Identifying which “federal officials” would be subject to the ban (this could range from high-level appointees to potentially a broader scope of employees). Specific prohibited activities, such as buying, selling, or holding certain types or values of digital assets. Mechanisms for enforcement and potential penalties for non-compliance. Possible carve-outs or exceptions (e.g., for diversified mutual funds that happen to hold some exposure, or for assets held prior to taking office, requiring divestment). This legislative push by the US Senators crypto community is watching closely is part of a broader trend of governments worldwide grappling with how to regulate digital assets and ensure ethical conduct among public servants in the face of new financial technologies. The TRUMP Meme Coin Under the Microscope Alongside their legislative efforts, Senators Murphy and Blumenthal have launched a specific inquiry into the Trump meme coin , also known by its ticker symbol TRUMP or MAGA. This investigation elevates concerns from the general concept of officials owning crypto to a specific instance involving a former President and potential future candidate. Meme coins are a unique, often highly volatile, class of cryptocurrencies typically based on internet memes, cultural trends, or, in this case, political figures. Their value is often driven more by speculation, community hype, and sentiment rather than underlying technology or utility. According to a report by Fox61, the senators’ concerns regarding the TRUMP meme coin are multi-faceted: Potential Conflicts of Interest: Given Donald Trump’s prominent political status and potential future political activities, any financial interest he holds in a coin bearing his name and associated with his political brand raises questions about whether his actions or statements could be influenced by his financial stake in the asset. Foreign Influence: The inquiry reportedly touches upon concerns about foreign actors potentially using such assets for influence or financial manipulation. The global nature of cryptocurrency markets means that holders and traders of assets like the TRUMP coin are located worldwide, making the source and intent of large holdings difficult to trace. Reported Earnings: A key driver of the investigation appears to be the significant reported earnings linked to the coin. Fox61 reported that concerns include Trump’s reported earnings exceeding $100 million from the coin’s trading fees. While the mechanics of such high earnings specifically from *trading fees* for an individual linked to a meme coin are complex and potentially involve other factors like appreciation of held tokens, the sheer magnitude of the reported figure has clearly caught the attention of lawmakers, highlighting the significant financial stakes involved. The senators are likely seeking information on who benefits from the coin, how it was distributed, its ties to political campaigns or entities, and the extent of any involvement or profit by individuals associated with federal office. Understanding Conflicts of Interest Crypto Poses for Officials The core issue highlighted by both the proposed bill and the TRUMP coin investigation is the unique challenge digital assets pose regarding conflicts of interest for federal officials crypto is becoming intertwined with. Unlike traditional assets like stocks in large, established companies where officials might recuse themselves from specific decisions directly impacting those companies, the crypto market presents new complexities: Market Volatility: Crypto markets are known for extreme volatility. Significant personal holdings mean an official’s net worth could swing wildly based on market movements, potentially creating pressure to act in ways that benefit their portfolio. Information Asymmetry: Officials might have access to non-public information about upcoming regulations, enforcement actions, or policy changes that could drastically affect crypto prices. Trading on such information would be a clear ethical violation and potentially illegal. Decentralization and Pseudonymity: While not entirely anonymous, the pseudonymous nature of many crypto transactions can make tracking ownership and identifying potential influences more difficult than with traditional financial assets. Novelty and Lack of Precedent: Existing ethics rules were primarily designed for traditional assets. Applying them effectively to the diverse and rapidly changing world of digital assets requires new interpretations or specific legislation. Politically Linked Assets: Assets like the Trump meme coin add another layer, directly tying financial value to political fortunes and figures, blurring the lines between personal finance, political activity, and public service. These factors make the case for clear rules regarding federal officials crypto holdings more urgent in the eyes of many lawmakers and ethics watchdogs. What Could This Mean for Crypto Regulation Bill Efforts? The actions by Senators Murphy and Blumenthal are not happening in a vacuum. They are part of a broader, ongoing debate in the United States about how to regulate the cryptocurrency industry. Numerous bills have been proposed in Congress, addressing everything from market structure and consumer protection to taxation and environmental impact. This specific focus on federal officials’ holdings and politically themed tokens could add momentum to the overall regulatory push. It frames the issue not just as a financial or technological one, but as an ethical and governance challenge directly impacting the integrity of public service. While a bill banning officials from profiting from digital assets might seem narrow, it sets a precedent and reflects a growing sentiment among lawmakers that the status quo regarding crypto and public office is insufficient. Success in passing this type of legislation could pave the way for further regulatory clarity or action in other areas of the crypto market. Conversely, the political nature of the TRUMP coin inquiry could also inject partisan dynamics into the regulatory debate, potentially complicating efforts to pass comprehensive crypto legislation that requires bipartisan support. Potential Challenges and Criticisms While the goals of transparency and preventing conflicts of interest are widely supported, any legislation banning federal officials from owning digital assets is likely to face scrutiny and potential challenges: Scope: Defining who is a “federal official” and what level of involvement or knowledge warrants a complete ban on digital asset ownership can be complex. Should it apply to every government employee, or only those in positions of power or with access to sensitive information? Enforcement: Tracking compliance in the decentralized crypto space can be difficult. How would such a ban be effectively monitored and enforced? Personal Liberty: Some might argue that a complete ban infringes on the personal financial freedom of public servants, potentially making it harder to attract talent to government roles. Defining “Profit”: The bill targets “profiting.” How is this defined in the context of volatile assets? Does it include unrealized gains? What about receiving assets (like airdrops) without directly purchasing them? Distinguishing Asset Types: Should the rules differentiate between highly speculative meme coins and more established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, or potentially stablecoins? These are questions that will need to be addressed as the bill potentially moves through the legislative process. Similarly, the TRUMP coin investigation will need to navigate complex issues of proving intent, tracing transactions, and determining the extent of any improper influence or activity. What Happens Next? The proposed bill will need to go through the standard legislative process, including committee review, potential amendments, and votes in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. Its passage is far from guaranteed and will depend on various factors, including political will, lobbying efforts, and public opinion. The investigation into the Trump meme coin is an inquiry, meaning the senators are gathering information. This could lead to various outcomes, such as a public report detailing their findings, recommendations for regulatory or legislative action, or potentially referrals to other oversight bodies if evidence of wrongdoing is found. For the broader crypto market and those interested in the intersection of digital assets and politics, these developments signal that lawmakers are increasingly paying attention. Politically themed tokens, in particular, are likely to remain under scrutiny. Conclusion: Navigating the Evolving Landscape The actions taken by Senators Murphy and Blumenthal represent a significant moment in the ongoing conversation about cryptocurrency and ethics in government. By proposing a bill to restrict federal officials’ digital asset holdings and launching an investigation into the TRUMP meme coin, they are directly confronting the potential for conflicts of interest crypto assets introduce into the political sphere. While the path forward for both the proposed legislation and the investigation remains uncertain, they highlight crucial questions about transparency, influence, and the need for clear rules in a rapidly changing financial and technological landscape. As the world of digital assets continues to evolve, so too will the challenges and the need for careful consideration of their impact on public service and democratic integrity. Staying informed about these developments is essential for anyone involved in or observing the cryptocurrency market, particularly as regulatory frameworks continue to take shape in the United States and globally.

Pseudonymous analyst Jack tells his 268,600 followers on X that he doesn’t expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates at Wednesday’s meeting, despite oil falling below $60 – a level he says reflects “bad financial conditions.” Oil is trading at $59.77 at time of writing, down over 22% from its 2025 opening price of $77.46. Crashing oil prices typically signal demand destruction and a weakening global economy. According to the analyst, the gloomy macroeconomic backdrop sets up the “perfect trade” for BTC. “How does Bitcoin perform here? Best guess is it follows equities but decouples and recovers quickly. Take gold as an example in March 2020: a short, shallow crash, and then the start of the steepest phase of its parabolic trend. It would be the perfect trade and could be the base for a mind-blowing rally.” In March 2020, gold lost nearly 15% of its value before igniting a 43% surge in just five months. Zooming in on Bitcoin, Jack says BTC needs to stay above $93,000 to avoid witnessing another corrective move. “Low time frame BTC bulls don’t want to see price at X again. Otherwise, I expect a flush.” Source: Jack/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $96,791, up over 2% in the past day.

Bhutan, a landlocked country in south-central Asia, is now accepting crypto payments through a new national-level tourism system powered by Binance Pay and DK Bank, which Binance calls the world’s first of its kind. The initiative allows travelers with Binance accounts to pay for nearly every part of their journey using crypto. This includes airline tickets, visa fees, hotel stays, monument entry, tour guides, and even “fresh fruit from roadside stalls,” according to a Wednesday announcement . Binance says more than 100 local merchants have already been onboarded, though it didn’t name specific businesses accepting crypto. According to the announcement, visitors can pay by scanning dynamic or static QR codes via the Binance app, with support for over 100 cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin ( BTC ) and USD Coin ( USDC ). While tourists pay in crypto, merchants still receive in local currency, as all transactions are settled through DK Bank, Bhutan’s digital bank licensed by the Royal Monetary Authority of Bhutan.

In 2022, more than 10% of the educated population emigrated. The exact size of Bhutan’s BTC holdings remains unclear, though data from different blockchain analytics firms implies that it could be worth more than $600 million, or about 30% of the country’s GDP.

A significant milestone has just been reached by ZKsync (ZK), a leading Ethereum layer-2 (L2) scaling solution. ZKsync announced on X (formerly Twitter) that it has successfully achieved full Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) equivalence. This is more than just a technical upgrade; it’s a breakthrough moment with profound implications for developers, users, and the entire Ethereum Layer 2 ecosystem. What Does ZKsync EVM Equivalence Really Mean? Before this announcement, layer-2 solutions often aimed for EVM compatibility, meaning they could run code written in languages like Solidity. However, achieving full EVM equivalence is a much higher standard. It means the L2 network behaves *exactly* like the Ethereum mainnet’s EVM at the bytecode level. Think of it this way: EVM Compatibility: Your car can run on a specific type of fuel (Solidity). EVM Equivalence: Your car is identical to another car down to every bolt and wire, so any mechanic can use their standard tools and parts on it without needing special training or equipment. For ZKsync, this level of equivalence is a game-changer. It allows developers to use existing Ethereum tools, clients, toolkits, and configuration files without needing to modify them or learn ZKsync-specific versions. Previously, developers might have needed specialized compilers like zkSolc or frameworks tailored for ZKsync, such as Foundry ZKsync, to deploy smart contracts. Now, they can take their compiled EVM bytecode – the low-level instructions that the EVM understands – and deploy it directly onto ZKsync. This removes a significant barrier to entry for developers looking to build or migrate decentralized applications (dApps) to ZKsync. Why is Full EVM Equivalence So Important for ZKsync Development? Achieving full ZKsync EVM equivalence offers a multitude of benefits, primarily centered around simplifying the development process and accelerating ecosystem growth. Here are some key advantages: Seamless Migration: Existing dApps on Ethereum mainnet or other EVM-compatible chains can be ported to ZKsync with minimal, if any, code changes. This drastically reduces the time and effort required for projects to leverage ZKsync’s scaling capabilities. Access to Standard Tools: Developers can continue using familiar and widely-adopted Ethereum development tools like Hardhat, Truffle, Remix, Metamask (for interaction), Ethers.js, and Web3.js. This eliminates the need to learn new toolchains, lowering the learning curve significantly. Broader Developer Pool: Any developer experienced with building on Ethereum is now effectively a ZKsync developer. This opens the door to a much larger talent pool, encouraging more innovation and development on the platform. Enhanced Security & Auditing: Since the code behaves identically to Ethereum, existing security practices, auditing tools, and formal verification methods designed for the EVM can be applied directly to ZKsync contracts, potentially improving the security posture of deployed applications. Faster Iteration: With reduced complexity in the development and deployment pipeline, teams can build, test, and deploy new features or dApps more quickly. This move positions ZKsync as a highly attractive destination for developers seeking scalability without sacrificing the familiarity and robustness of the Ethereum development environment. The Bigger Picture: EVM Equivalence and Blockchain Scaling The race for effective blockchain scaling is crucial for the widespread adoption of decentralized technologies. Ethereum, while pioneering, faces limitations in transaction throughput and cost on its mainnet, especially during periods of high demand. Layer-2 solutions like ZKsync are designed to alleviate this by processing transactions off-chain and then submitting a compressed summary or proof back to the Ethereum mainnet. Zero-Knowledge (ZK) rollups, the technology underpinning ZKsync, use cryptographic proofs to verify the correctness of off-chain computations. This approach offers strong security guarantees inherited from Ethereum. Achieving full EVM equivalence is a critical step in the evolution of ZK-rollups. Historically, one of the main challenges for ZK-rollups has been achieving true EVM compatibility, let alone equivalence, due to the complexity of proving arbitrary EVM computations within a ZK-proof system. ZKsync’s success here demonstrates significant progress in this area, making ZK-rollups more accessible and practical for the vast majority of Ethereum developers. This development not only benefits ZKsync but also pushes the entire field of Ethereum Layer 2 scaling forward, setting a high bar for other L2 solutions aiming for similar levels of developer experience and compatibility. What’s Next for ZKsync and its Ecosystem? With full ZKsync development now aligned with standard Ethereum practices, we can anticipate several positive outcomes: Increased dApp Deployment: Expect a surge in the number and variety of dApps deploying on ZKsync, as the technical hurdles have been significantly lowered. This could include established DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, gaming platforms, and more. Enhanced Liquidity and Activity: More dApps naturally lead to increased user activity, transaction volume, and potentially greater liquidity within the ZKsync ecosystem. Innovation: Developers freed from dealing with ZK-specific tooling can focus more energy on building innovative applications and features. Potential for User Growth: While EVM equivalence is primarily a developer benefit, a thriving ecosystem with more dApps and better performance ultimately benefits end-users through more options and potentially lower transaction costs. This achievement is a testament to the hard work of the ZKsync team and a positive signal for the future growth of their network and the broader Ethereum scaling landscape. In Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment ZKsync’s announcement of achieving full EVM equivalence marks a pivotal moment for the platform and the Ethereum ecosystem. By enabling developers to use standard Ethereum tools and deploy existing bytecode directly, ZKsync has removed a major barrier to entry, making L2 development significantly more accessible and efficient. This breakthrough is set to accelerate ZKsync development , attract more projects, and contribute meaningfully to the critical goal of blockchain scaling for Ethereum.

In its official X account, WLFI commented , “WLF fam — it’s time. A new Snapshot vote is live to airdrop USD1 to all eligible WLFI holders. Free USD1. The hottest stablecoin in crypto. Don’t miss your chance — vote now.” WLFI airdrop proposal is garnering overwhelming support With more than 99% of votes in favor, the airdrop will distribute a small amount of USD1 stablecoin to eligible WLFI token holders, as outlined in the May 6 proposal on the WLFI governance forum. The proposal states that testing the airdrop mechanism in a live setting is crucial to ensure smart contract functionality and readiness. This distribution also serves as a meaningful way to thank the earliest supporters and introduce them to USD1. The amount of USD1 is yet to be determined but will be based on the total eligible wallets and budget. The date for the airdrop is also pending, and WLFI says it reserves the “right to discontinue, suspend, modify or terminate the test airdrop” at any time. Voting is set to conclude on May 14. So far, support for the measure is overwhelming, with approximately 2.6 billion tokens, representing 99.97%, cast in favor, while just 901,000 tokens, or 0.03%, have been used to vote against it. WLFI also partnered with HTX Global and ListaDAO On May 5, WLFI reported that the USD1 sellable reportedly was launched officially on HTX Global. The company noted token trading would be made available on May 6, and the withdrawals would be permitted as of May 7. Besides working with HTX Global, WLFI also announced that it has teamed up with ListaDAO to merge USD1 into its system. ListaDAO even recently confirmed that the USD1 Vault is already live, and the USD1/lisUSD liquidity pool and USD1 as CDP collateral will launch soon. It even announced that it would have more integrations with WLFI in time. So far, all of WLFI’s collaborations around the USD1 token appear to align with its stated goals of ensuring compliance, promoting transparency, and increasing the token’s visibility. Eric Trump, the US president’s son, and WLFI co-founder Zach Witkoff have consistently emphasized that they aim for USD1 to be the most compliant, transparent, and trustworthy stablecoin. Eric even thinks facilitating the development of transparent stablecoins such as USD1 might be conducive to the internationalization of the US dollar. WLFI snapshot vote for its USD1 airdrop s hows an almost 100% approval rate and will end next week. Similarly, last month, WLFI declared that it would conduct an airdrop of its USD1 stablecoin to qualifying WLFI token holders. The company said the test would increase visibility into USD1 before launching it more widely . Moreover, they argued that testing the airdrop mechanism would ensure smart contract functionality and readiness . WLFI and President Trump are still under scrutiny over their projects WLFI launched USD1 in April after Congress started discussing the STABLE Act. Critics quickly pointed out that President Trump had conflicts of interest, given his ties to WLFI. To worsen the situation, about $390 million was reportedly allocated to DT Marks DEFI LLC, a Trump-affiliated entity, from the $550 million raised during WLFI token sales, arousing more questions. Not to mention, WLFI’s governance token is still non-transferable, raising more concerns over transparency and decentralization. Senator Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Maxine Waters have even asked the SEC to disclose internal documents on WLFI over regulatory favoritism concerns. Their request follows the commission’s move to pause enforcement actions on Justin Sun, a WLFI investor and founder of the Tron blockchain.

Solayer’s token has dropped by nearly 35% in the past 24 hours, trading at $1.75 as of press time. The token is now down 47.8% from its all-time high of $3.39 set on May 5. Market activity surged alongside the price drop, with over $1.26 billion in LAYER traded in the last 24 hours, a 179% increase, as per CoinGecko data . The sharp decline appears to be driven by investor fear over an upcoming May 11 token unlock.

Khi đồng tiền mã hóa hàng đầu thế giới ghi nhận mức tăng 14.08% , vượt xa kỳ vọng và thậm chí còn lật kèo sau cú sập đau đầu tháng. Đợt tăng giá này giúp Bitcoin tăng hơn 32% từ mức thấp nhất $74,501 trong tháng Tư leo lên gần $98,000 – một minh chứng rõ ràng cho sự bền bỉ đỉnh cao của tài sản này giữa bối cảnh kinh tế vĩ mô đầy biến động và tâm lý rủi ro thay đổi liên tục. Việc giành lại vùng giá $95,000 – ranh giới dưới của vùng giao dịch ba tháng trước đó – hiện là mốc kỹ thuật quan trọng nhất . Nếu Bitcoin giữ vững được vùng giá này, đặc biệt khi nó đang củng cố trên mức Chi Phí Cơ Sở của Nhà Đầu Tư Ngắn Hạn ở $93,340, thì rất có thể sẽ mở đường cho một cú bứt phá trở lại đỉnh cao mọi thời đại. Dữ liệu on-chain cũng đang ủng hộ kịch bản tích cực này: các thợ đào vẫn ôm chặt Bitcoin, và chỉ số Puell Multiple cho thấy họ không có ý định xả hàng ồ ạt. Điều này cho thấy niềm tin rằng đợt tăng giá chưa dừng lại ở đây. Dù diễn biến ngắn hạn phụ thuộc vào việc BTC có thể biến mức hỗ trợ này thành nền tảng bền vững hay không, nhưng các tín hiệu cấu trúc vẫn nghiêng về xu hướng tăng – đặt sân khấu cho một mùa hè bùng cháy nếu điều kiện vĩ mô ổn định. Dự Trữ Bitcoin của Thợ Đào (Nguồn: CryptoQuant) Nền kinh tế Mỹ thể hiện sự vẻ ngoài ăn chắc mặc bền trong tháng Tư, với 177,000 việc làm mới được tạo ra và tỷ lệ thất nghiệp ổn định ở mức 4.2% . Tỷ lệ tham gia lực lượng lao động tăng lên, và các ngành chủ chốt như giáo dục, y tế và dịch vụ khách sạn tiếp tục tuyển dụng. Tuy nhiên, tốc độ tăng lương đã chậm lại ở mức 0.2% hàng tháng và 3.8% hàng năm, số lượng việc làm mới giảm, và một số ngành như sản xuất và bán lẻ mất việc – những dấu hiệu cho thấy thị trường lao động đang hạ nhiệt. Những con số tích cực này che giấu những vấn đề cấu trúc sâu xa hơn, khi các công ty có thể đang “ ôm chặt nhân sự ” sau những khó khăn trong tuyển dụng trước đây, và báo cáo việc làm ngày càng được coi là một chỉ báo trễ. Trong khi đó, chi tiêu tiêu dùng dường như ổn định trên bề mặt nhưng lộ ra nhiều vết nứt bên dưới – doanh số mua hàng hóa lâu bền giảm mạnh , trong khi hàng hóa tiêu dùng nhanh và dịch vụ tăng nhẹ . Một đợt tăng tạm thời trong đầu tư thiết bị đã kéo số liệu đầu tư tư nhân lên, nhưng sức mạnh kinh tế tổng thể vẫn yếu. Nhập khẩu tăng vọt hơn 40%, làm thâm hụt thương mại mở rộng và kéo GDP quý I giảm 0.3%, chủ yếu do các doanh nghiệp đẩy mạnh nhập hàng trước khi thuế quan tăng. Tổng Sản Phẩm Quốc Nội (GDP) (Nguồn: Cục Phân Tích Kinh Tế) Niềm tin người tiêu dùng đã lao dốc xuống mức thấp nhất kể từ năm 2020 , với Chỉ Số Kỳ Vọng giảm xuống mức thường gắn liền với suy thoái. Những lo ngại về thu nhập, an ninh việc làm và lạm phát – được thúc đẩy bởi căng thẳng thương mại kéo dài – đang đè nặng lên tâm lý. Khi áp lực lạm phát từ thuế quan gia tăng và tốc độ tăng trưởng thu nhập hộ gia đình đình trệ, nước Mỹ đang đối mặt với một giai đoạn hạ cánh mềm đầy bất ổn của nền kinh tế. Trong thế giới crypto, Nexo đã chính thức tái xuất thị trường Mỹ sau hai năm ẩn mình, viện dẫn môi trường pháp lý thuận lợi hơn và sự ủng hộ chính trị, đặc biệt dưới thời chiến dịch thân crypto của Trump. Công ty này hiện đặt mục tiêu cung cấp một bộ sản phẩm tài chính dựa trên crypto hoàn toàn tuân thủ, phản ánh sự chuyển dịch của ngành hướng tới hợp tác với cơ quan quản lý. Trong khi đó, Hạ Viện Arizona đã thông qua hai dự luật cho phép tiểu bang đầu tư tối đa 10% quỹ của mình vào Bitcoin và các loại tiền mã hóa khác, có thể biến Arizona thành tiểu bang đầu tiên ở Mỹ nắm giữ crypto trong hệ thống quỹ dự trữ và hưu trí – mặc dù kết quả vẫn chưa chắc chắn do Thống đốc Hobbs cảnh báo phủ quyết vì những lo ngại về ngân sách. Bên kia Đại Tây Dương, chính phủ Anh đã đưa ra dự thảo luật quản lý các nền tảng crypto, nhấn mạnh bảo vệ người tiêu dùng và minh bạch, đồng thời tăng cường hợp tác với Mỹ để xây dựng khung pháp lý xuyên Đại Tây Dương. Cuối cùng, SEC đã kết thúc cuộc điều tra về stablecoin PYUSD của PayPal mà không có hành động thực thi nào, báo hiệu sự rõ ràng tiềm năng trong quy định về stablecoin và củng cố vị thế của PayPal trong hệ sinh thái tài sản số đang phát triển.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/trader-says-xrp-will-repeat-this-major-rally-soon-heres-why/,"XRP community member and social media user “Lord XRP” posted a statement on X claiming, “#XRP WILL REPEAT IT SOON,” accompanied by a historical screenshot from CoinMarketCap showing XRP trading at $3.11 with a market capitalization exceeding $120 billion. The image reflects when XRP ranked second in global cryptocurrency market capitalization, just behind Bitcoin and ahead of Ethereum, a position it no longer holds today. The attached image, likely from early January 2018, captures XRP at its all-time high of $3.11 with a 24-hour trading volume of over $5.6 billion and a circulating supply of 38.7 billion XRP. At that point, the token had posted a 24-hour gain of 29.70%, highlighting a surge in investor interest during the peak of the previous major crypto bull run. According to Lord XRP’s post, the current market context suggests a similar price level could soon be revisited. #XRP WILL REPEAT IT SOON pic.twitter.com/3wEPQ67L56 — Lord XRP (@Bitforcoinz) May 4, 2025 Community Member Remains Hopeful While Lord XRP’s post centers on historical data, additional comments from other X users contribute to the sentiment within the XRP community . A user named Sophia replied to the post, stating , “I hope that as you said, XRP will shine in the near future!” Her comment reflects optimism among long-time XRP holders , many of whom have been anticipating a return to previous highs following regulatory clarity and broader market recovery. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Investor Sentiment and Historical Comparisons The use of the CoinMarketCap image is central to Lord XRP’s message. The post is not merely a nostalgic look at the 2017–2018 bull market but a declaration that such valuations are achievable once again. The XRP community continues to monitor signs of institutional adoption, regulatory progress, and Ripple’s ongoing developments, such as its acquisition of Hidden Road , viewing them as key catalysts that could drive XRP to revisit the $3.11 level. Lord XRP’s post does not provide a timeframe or specific catalysts for the price prediction. Instead, the tweet serves as a reminder of XRP’s achievements and a call for confidence in its future. For many in the community, such historical context strengthens their belief that XRP is undervalued relative to its past and potential.

With Ethereum’s upcoming hard fork, Binance has announced it will both delist underperforming trading pairs and temporarily suspend withdrawals and deposits on several networks. Delisting of Spot Trading Pairs on May 9 Binance will delist three spot trading pairs —ANIME/BNB, STRK/BTC, and THE/BTC—on May 9, 2025, at 03:00 UTC. The exchange stated that the decision was made due to low trading volumes and poor liquidity, which can negatively affect the user experience and overall market quality. Users who hold positions in these pairs are advised to close or adjust them before the delisting takes effect. Temporary Suspension of Deposits and Withdrawals on May 7 In addition to the delisting, Binance will suspend deposits and withdrawals across multiple blockchain networks on May 7, 2025 , to support the upcoming Ethereum network upgrade and hard fork. The suspension will begin at 09:45 UTC, approximately 20 minutes before the scheduled upgrade at 10:05 UTC. The networks affected include Ethereum (ETH), Arbitrum (ARB), Optimism (OP), zkSync Era (ZKSYNC), Base (BASE), Manta Network (MANTA), Starknet (STRK), Polygon (POL), Metis (METIS), Scroll (SCR), Cyber (CYBER), Metal DAO (MTL), Celo (CELO), and Worldcoin (WLD). Binance has confirmed that deposits and withdrawals on these networks will resume once the upgraded network is stable and secure. Binance noted that these measures are part of its broader effort to ensure platform reliability, asset security, and smooth operations during critical blockchain events like the Ethereum upgrade. This Ethereum hard fork is expected to introduce several core improvements to the network, and Binance’s proactive steps are designed to minimize risk and enhance user safety throughout the process.",News|Exchange News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ETH|EXCHANGE|BNB|FORKS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-07 07:26:35

World Liberty Financial (WLFI) has initiated a governance vote to determine whether a small amount of its newly launched stablecoin, USD1, should be airdropped to early WLFI token holders. The proposed airdrop is being positioned as a test of the technical functionality of the airdrop mechanism. The vote is set to conclude on May 14 and has already seen overwhelming support from the community. According to data from the WLFI governance forum , over 2.6 billion tokens—representing approximately 99.97% of votes cast—are in favor of the proposal. A small minority, totaling about 940K tokens, have voted against it. While the airdrop itself has not yet been scheduled, WLFI has made it clear that the test could be modified or canceled at any time at its discretion.

The coin is fully backed by reserves consisting of short-term U.S. Treasuries, cash, and equivalent high-quality assets. Digital asset custodian BitGo will oversee the reserves backing USD1. “USD1 provides what algorithmic and anonymous crypto projects cannot—access to the power of DeFi underpinned by the credibility and safeguards of the most respected names in traditional finance,” said WLFI co-founder Zach Witkoff. The stablecoin was quietly deployed on the BNB Chain in early March. Its presence was first detected by blockchain analytics firm LookOnChain, which traced the contract to a wallet associated with crypto market maker Wintermute, indicating preliminary test transactions. On March 24, CZ noted that the stablecoin’s smart contract had been deployed 20 days ago, confirming an early March launch. On March 25, WLFI formally announced the launch of USD1, stating that the stablecoin would first become available on Ethereum ( ETH ) and Binance Smart Chain ( BNB ), with plans to expand to other blockchain networks.

Kaito ( KAITO ) rallied to hit an intraday high of $1.17 on May 7 before cooling down a bit to around $1.13 by press time. That’s nearly a 70% gain from last month’s low. Its market cap has also exploded, sitting at over $273 million. As of May 7, morning Asian time, its daily trading volume was 340% higher than the previous day at over $317 million, indicating a major rise in trading activity. The surge followed a sharp increase in futures open interest in recent days, which hit a 2-month high of $103 million, way up from about $37.7 million just a month ago, per data from CoinGlass. The simultaneous rise in price and open interest typically signals strengthening bullish sentiment. KAITO crypto’s recent price surge appears to be the renewed attention it’s getting after Kaito integrated Huma Finance’s Yapper leaderboard ahead of its TGE. Yappers are users who actively post and engage with crypto-related content on X, and they earn rewards through Kaito’s platform .

According to the announcement , eligible yappers will get special rewards, likely in tokens like KAITO or even Huma’s upcoming token or ecosystem perks, for boosting awareness of Huma Finance. Momentum was already high after Kaito founder Yu Hu, in a May 5 X post, announced they’re kicking off the ‘Earn and Drop’ season with the first collaboration being with PayFi Network BOOP . we kicked off social airdrop season in Jan with bera, story, kaito and many others we kicked off our strategic KAITO accumulation in Mar and accumulated ~3M KAITO in we are kicking off our earn and drop season in May with BOOP and so many other opportunities to come… — Yu Hu 🌊 (@Punk9277) May 5, 2025 On top of that, the project recently added Total Value Distributed data to its Dune Analytics dashboard, giving more transparency into how rewards are flowing across the ecosystem. Dune data shows that over $71 million in rewards have already been distributed to yappers, stakers, and hodlers across the ecosystem, excluding the KAITO airdrop. The project also now boasts over 200,000 monthly active yappers, showing strong community growth. Meanwhile, a look at CoinGlass reveals that investors have withdrawn more than 2 million KAITO tokens from exchanges in the past 30 days. This withdrawal trend hints at accumulation by holders, which adds to the positive sentiment. Kaito price analysis On the 4-hour USDT chart, KAITO broke out above a descending parallel channel yesterday, a move that suggests the downtrend might be over and bulls are taking charge. KAITO price, CMF and Aroon chart — May 7 | Source: crypto.news Before this, KAITO had already broken out of a multi-week descending trendline, adding to the bullish momentum. The buying pressure is also showing up in the indicators: the Chaikin Money Flow has climbed to 0.21, signaling stronger demand, while the Aroon Up is at a high 97.86% and the Aroon Down is all the way at 0%, showing buyers are clearly dominating. With this setup, KAITO might be on track to retest the $1.50 psychological resistance it hit back in March, that’s roughly 32% higher than where it’s trading right now. However, market commentators remain optimistic that the rally could extend even further, potentially reaching $1.75, thanks to a rounded bottom pattern showing up on the 1-day chart, a major bullish reversal sign in technical analysis.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands at phase 4 of its token sales with $0.025 per token and has sold more than 443 million tokens where 57% of this specific phase has been acquired. Dogecoin maintains a current price at $0.18 but investors believe it might reach $1 while Solana stands at $151 but anticipates reaching $200 because of ongoing ETF approval discussions. Dogecoin’s Meme-Driven Push Market analysts detect that Dogecoin shows signs of an impending breakout according to its weekly chart data. A Gaussian Channel analyzes that Dogecoin will probably reach $1 with a 450% increase from its current market value of $0.18. Social media hype and whale activity create risks for the platform due to its dependence on these factors. Network transaction data indicates that retail participant interest in the market seems to be waning as records demonstrate a 94% decline. The current absence of fresh utility systems makes a 70x gain (approximately $12.60) for Dogecoin appear unlikely to materialize. Market participants continue to discuss Dogecoin actively due to its volatile price behavior although volatility creates significant challenges. Solana’s Scalable Ambition The cryptocurrency market keeps Solana at $150 and above while the price has climbed 20% across the past month. Experts predict Solana will reach $280 since the predicted approval probability of ETFs stands at 80% during 2025. Market participants have been active based on its $3.39 billion trading volume yet the $160 resistance point might create barriers to additional growth. The projection of a 70x price increase up to $10,570 appears unlikely because its current market capitalization and congestion issues already exist. Solana wins developers through its scalable properties although its expansion pace seems lower than what some projects achieve. Mutuum Finance’s DeFi Surge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently building its position as an important part of decentralized lending solutions. Current Mutuum Finance investors stand to gain huge returns through phase 4 of its 11-stage presale which is 57% filled at $0.025. Investors can expect a 140% value growth when Mutuum Finance tokens enter the market at $0.06. The target price projection for MUTM after its launch settlement stands at $2.50 which represents a staggering 9,900 percent increase from its current value. The team is finishing a Certik audit of its smart contracts while preparing to reveal the results through social media channels to increase confidence. The recently introduced dashboard system offers bonus tokens to the top 50 holders who keep their positions. Mutuum’s Lending Edge The peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer dual-lending system operates as the main reason why users are drawn to the platform. The liquidity pools formed by lenders generate interest for them while borrowers obtain funds through loans requiring elevated collateral amounts. Holding MUTM tokens steady through platform fees enables token purchases that distribute funds to staker participants and maintains a stable market demand. The latest phase exceeds its fundraising goal by $7.6 million which will lead the project to its end while intensifying the critical nature of its last stretch. Early investors must rush to benefit from the decreasing opportunity to purchase MUTM at $0.025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) establishes itself through organized progress which positions the project for considerable market expansion opportunities. Mutuum’s Path to 70x The calculated DeFi approach adopted by Mutuum Finance positions it as one of the leading services in its sector. Mutuum will deliver a 140% listing success while forecasting $2.50 as its goal which demonstrates a 70x increase potential to $1.75 value by 2026 thus surpassing both Dogecoin’s speculative price swings and Solana’s gradual growth path. The continuing audit process joins with leaderboard rewards to enhance investor confidence. Mutuum Finance emerges as the preferred project because it presents both fundamental capabilities and a strong launch presale performance. Potential investors pursuing high investment returns need to research Mutuum Finance (MUTM) prior to phase 5 launch.

44268929,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157979,1746603020,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent: Binance Suspend Deposits on Multiple Networks for Ethereum Upgrade May 7,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/binance-suspend-deposits-ethereum/,"Attention crypto users! Stay informed about crucial updates from one of the world’s leading crypto exchanges. In recent crypto exchange news , Binance has announced a significant upcoming event that will temporarily impact users dealing with certain tokens. Why is Binance Suspend Deposits on Multiple Networks? Binance recently communicated through its official channels that it will implement a temporary halt on deposit and withdrawal services for tokens operating on a variety of networks. This isn’t a cause for alarm, but rather a necessary step taken in anticipation of a scheduled Ethereum network upgrade and associated network hard fork . Network upgrades and hard forks are critical events in the life cycle of a blockchain. They involve significant changes to the protocol, often introducing new features, improving efficiency, or enhancing security. For a large platform like Binance, preparing for such an event requires careful coordination to ensure the safety and integrity of user funds and transactions during the transition period. By temporarily pausing deposits and withdrawals, Binance can manage the transition smoothly, preventing potential issues that could arise from transactions initiated during the upgrade process. This proactive measure is standard practice across major exchanges during significant blockchain updates. Understanding the Binance Transaction Suspension The announced Binance transaction suspension is set to begin around 09:45 UTC on May 7. It’s important to note that this suspension is temporary. Binance has stated they will reopen deposits and withdrawals once they deem the upgraded network stable and operational, and they have completed their internal checks. Users should be aware that trading of the affected tokens will generally remain unaffected during this period. The suspension specifically targets the movement of tokens onto or off the exchange via the listed networks. Internal transfers or trading pairs on Binance should continue as normal, subject to overall market conditions. While the exact duration of the suspension is not typically fixed in advance – as it depends on the successful completion and stability of the network upgrade – users are advised to monitor official Binance announcements for updates on when services will resume. Which Networks Are Affected by the Suspension? The upcoming suspension is quite broad, covering tokens on several popular networks that interact with the Ethereum ecosystem or are related layer-2 solutions. The networks impacted by the decision to Binance suspend deposits and withdrawals include: Ethereum (ETH) Arbitrum (ARB) Optimism (OP) zkSync Era (ZKSYNC) Base (BASE) Manta Network (MANTA) Starknet (STRK) Polygon (POL) Metis (METIS) Scroll (SCR) Cyber (CYBER) Metal DAO (MTL) Celo (CELO) Worldcoin (WLD) This extensive list highlights the interconnectedness of these networks with the core Ethereum infrastructure and the potential impact of the Ethereum network upgrade across the broader ecosystem. Actionable Insights for Users For users who frequently deposit or withdraw tokens on these networks via Binance, here are some key takeaways: Plan Ahead: If you need to deposit or withdraw tokens on any of the listed networks, ensure you complete these transactions well before the scheduled start time of the suspension (09:45 UTC on May 7). Monitor Announcements: Keep a close watch on Binance’s official announcement channels (website, app notifications) for real-time updates regarding the suspension start, progress of the network hard fork , and the eventual resumption of services. Understand the Scope: Remember that this primarily affects deposits and withdrawals on the specific listed networks. Trading within Binance should not be impacted. Be Patient: Network upgrades can sometimes have unforeseen delays. Patience is key while the upgrade is completed and verified. This proactive communication from Binance is part of responsible exchange management, aiming to protect user assets and ensure a smooth transition during significant blockchain protocol changes. While a temporary inconvenience for those needing to move funds, it’s a necessary step for the long-term health and functionality of the affected networks and the broader crypto ecosystem. Conclusion: Navigating the Ethereum Network Upgrade The upcoming Binance transaction suspension is a direct consequence of the planned Ethereum network upgrade and subsequent network hard fork . By temporarily halting deposits and withdrawals for tokens on Ethereum and several related networks starting May 7, Binance is taking necessary precautions to ensure a seamless transition for its users and maintain the security of funds. This event underscores the dynamic nature of blockchain technology and the importance of staying informed about crypto exchange news and network developments. Users are encouraged to complete any necessary transactions before the deadline and monitor official communications for updates on the resumption of services.

Since mid-April, billions of dollars have been flowing into Bitcoin ETFs — but that’s not all. Bitcoin whales have also been buying huge amounts of BTC, even though the market hasn’t made a big move just yet. Could this be a setup for the next big rally? Let’s break it down. Billion-Dollar Bitcoin ETF Inflows Ahead of FOMC Meet Starting April 16, Bitcoin ETFs have attracted over $5.13 billion in total inflows. One of the main drivers of this is BlackRock, whose iShares Bitcoin Trust alone pulled in $4.7 billion since early April. As traders brace for the upcoming FOMC decision, a major positive that crypto won't see a serious drop is the fact that Bitcoin ETF inflow money has been sky-high since mid-April. Since April 16th, there has been $5.13B moved into collective BTC ETF's, pumping markets. pic.twitter.com/tbDFcBexGQ — Santiment (@santimentfeed) May 7, 2025 However, despite the strong inflows in recent weeks, Bitcoin ETFs saw an outflow of $85.7 million on May 6. This ongoing accumulation comes just ahead of the FOMC’s rate decision, where there’s a 98% chance , according to Polymarket, that the Fed will keep interest rates unchanged at 4.50%. If that happens, it would mark the third straight meeting without a hike, possibly giving Bitcoin more room to breathe. Big BTC Whale Buying Huge, Retail Sells At the same time, on-chain data tells an interesting story. Big Bitcoin whales with a wallet of 10 to 10,000 BTC have quietly added more than 81,000 BTC in the last six weeks. On the other hand, smaller wallets (holding less than 0.1 BTC) have sold around 290 BTC in the same period. This shows that while retail investors are unsure or losing patience, large holders are quietly building positions. Bitcoin Price Outlook Looking at the price momentum, Bitcoin price has briefly hit $97,500 before pulling back to $96,694, gaining about 2.35%. Meanwhile, prominent crypto analyst Crypto Rover recently shared some important price points for Bitcoin. He says that if Bitcoin starts to go up again, it will need to break these levels: $98,000: Bitcoin is close to this price but hasn’t gone past it yet. $102,000: This is an important level many traders are watching. $106,000: This could be the last hurdle before Bitcoin reaches a new high. Rover’s chart also shows that Bitcoin might drop to around $92,000 before it starts rising again, possibly reaching $106,000.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-07 07:32:08

The protocol will be led by Torab Torabi as the new CEO. On May 7, the network announced that it has terminated co-founder Rushi Manche and will proceed under a new leadership structure. “Details on leadership changes and a revamped governance structure will be coming soon,” said the protocol in an official post . Not long after, a new account emerged called The Movement ( MOVE ). It informed traders that the protocol has relaunched itself as Move Industries, a self-dubbed “new company” under a new leadership structure. Additionally, co-founder Cooper Scanlon has voluntarily stepped down as CEO. Therefore, Move Industries will be helmed by Torab Torabi as its CEO and ecosystem architect alongside Will Gaines, who will serve as President and Chief Marketing Officer. “This next chapter will ensure we continue building world-class infrastructure, world-class businesses and a world-class movement,” said Gaines in an official press release. Torabi views Move Industries as “the beginning of an exciting new chapter for the Movement” and vows to fully commit to improve the ecosystem, strengthening the community and supporting projects built on the network.

However, it appears the network’s recent restructuring has done little to save its native token, MOVE, from the inevitable tumble it has taken since market making allegations erupted. At press time, MOVE has gone down nearly 10% in the past 24 hours. It is currently trading hands at $0.16. In the past week, the token has plummeted more than 34%. In contrast, its daily trading volume has seen an exponential rise, having gone up by 141.4% compared to the previous trading day, indicating more market activity amidst the restructuring notice. What happened to Movement Labs’ Rushi Manche? Earlier this month, the protocol declared that it would be suspending co-founder Rushi Manche in light of a recent scandal involving one of its market makers, Rentech. This led to to the token being delisted from Coinbase , effectively suspending all related trading pairs. At the time, the protocol was still undergoing investigations from third-party reviewer Groom Lake “regarding organizational governance and recent incidents involving a market maker.” The token dump occurred December last year, when Rentech allegedly sold 66 million MOVE for an estimated profit of 38 million USDT ( USDT ). Binance reported the issue in March, freezing the money and notifying the Movement Foundation and Movement Labs. Since then, the protocol has cut off all ties with the market maker and pledged a $38 million USDT buyback through a new reserve fund.

The governor revealed that the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) will release about 1 trillion yuan ($178.2 billion) in liquidity. PBOC’s governor said the move would raise liquidity and stimulate China’s economic growth after an ongoing trade war with the U.S. He also said the government would increase the amount of money available for factory upgrades and other innovations, elder care, and other service businesses.

PBOC noted it will be the first reduction in 2025, with policymakers seeking to boost liquidity and prop up economic growth amid a heightened trade war with the U.S. Gongsheng told reporters on Wednesday that the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) will generate roughly 1 trillion yuan in liquidity, approximately $178.2 billion. He did not say when the cut will kick in, but the reduction follows two 50 basis point cuts for all banks that took effect in February and September last year. Gongsheng acknowledged that Beijing’s reverse repo rate on commercial banks’ deposits with PBOC was also reduced to 1.4% from 1.5%. The People’s Bank of China’s lending rate to commercial banks was also cut by 0.25 percentage points to 1.5%. The financial institution also reduced interest rates on five-year housing loans. As China battled a trade war with the U.S. after President Trump imposed triple-digit tariffs on Chinese goods, the country pledged at a key meeting in late April to cut banks’ reserve requirement ratio “in a timely manner.” Xing Zhaopeng, Senior China Strategist at ANZ, argued that the country’s domestic economy must be strong enough before Beijing starts any protracted trade negotiations.

Trump’s tariffs have begun to take a toll on China’s export-dependent economy, which has also faced pressure from a prolonged downturn in the property sector. The world’s two largest economies remained entangled in a standoff over Trump’s tariffs of as high as 145% on imports of most Chinese products. Beijing also retaliated with up to 125% tariffs on U.S. goods and ceased buying most American farm products. “We do not expect the reaction to be euphoric. Point being, any trade resolution would likely take a long time, and in the near term, there may be some piecemeal exemptions or tariff reductions on certain goods.” -Tan Jing Yi, Market Economist at Mizuho Bank. The trade talks have come at a time when both parties have remained adamant, at least in public, about not compromising on the tariffs. In a report, Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said that the talks could be the pivot point that either locks in fragile confidence or re-ignites the trade war. Both economies have shown signs of strain in recent weeks, after companies and consumers rushed to beat tariff increases. The U.S. economy plummeted by 0.3% in January-March. China’s economy grew at a 5.4% annual pace in the first quarter of the year after factories elevated production to fill a surge in orders. News of plans to boost the Chinese economy and for China-U.S. trade talks have pushed share prices up more than 2% in Hong Kong and 0.5% in Shanghai early Wednesday, with U.S. futures also advancing.

If so, there’s a crucial update you need to be aware of. Bithumb, one of South Korea’s major Crypto Exchange platforms, has officially announced a temporary halt on specific services related to the Gravity (G) token. This move is directly tied to an upcoming significant event for the project: its Mainnet Transition . What’s Happening at Bithumb ? According to an announcement posted on their official website, Bithumb will be temporarily suspending both deposit and withdrawal services for the Gravity (G) token. This isn’t a random event or a sign of trouble; rather, it’s a standard procedure performed by exchanges to support major network upgrades like a mainnet transition. Service Affected: Gravity (G) Deposits and Withdrawals Start Date & Time: May 7th, 2024, at 05:00 UTC Reason: To support the Gravity Mainnet Transition Duration: The suspension is temporary; services will resume after the transition is successfully completed and the network is deemed stable by Bithumb. Users should take note of the exact time provided. Any attempts to deposit or withdraw Gravity G tokens after this deadline on May 7th may result in loss of funds or significant delays once services resume. It’s always best practice to complete any necessary transactions well before the announced suspension time. Understanding Gravity G and Its Mainnet To fully grasp the significance of this announcement, it helps to understand what a mainnet is. In simple terms, a mainnet is a blockchain network that is fully developed and operational – it’s where actual transactions occur and the protocol lives. Before launching a mainnet, projects often operate on testnets (for testing) or on other blockchain networks as tokens (like ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum). A Mainnet Transition involves moving from a test environment or another chain onto the project’s own native, live blockchain. This is a complex technical process that requires careful coordination. While the specifics of the Gravity (G) project and its use case weren’t detailed in the Bithumb announcement, the fact that it’s undergoing a mainnet transition suggests the project is maturing and deploying its core technology. This transition is often aimed at: Improving scalability and transaction speed. Enhancing security features. Introducing new functionalities or features unique to the project’s protocol. Establishing full control over the network’s governance and development. Why a Deposit Withdrawal Suspension is Necessary You might wonder why a Deposit Withdrawal Suspension is required for a mainnet upgrade. It’s primarily for the safety and security of user funds and to ensure a smooth transition of assets to the new network. Here’s why exchanges like Bithumb implement these suspensions: Preventing Asset Loss: During the transition, the underlying network for Gravity (G) is changing. Deposits sent to the old network or addresses might not be recognized on the new mainnet, leading to lost funds. Similarly, withdrawals processed during the transition could face complications. Ensuring Accurate Balances: Exchanges need to accurately account for all user holdings on the old chain before the snapshot or migration to the new mainnet occurs. Suspending services ensures no new transactions complicate this process. Technical Integration: Bithumb’s systems need time to integrate with the new Gravity mainnet. This involves updating wallet infrastructure, testing connectivity, and ensuring compatibility with the new blockchain’s protocols. Minimizing Risk: Halting deposits and withdrawals is a precautionary measure to minimize potential risks associated with the complex technical procedures of a mainnet swap. Navigating the Mainnet Transition : What Users Need to Know For users holding Gravity G on Bithumb , the primary action is inaction during the suspension period. However, here are some actionable insights: Plan Ahead: If you need to deposit or withdraw G, do so well before the May 7th, 05:00 UTC deadline. Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on Bithumb’s official announcements regarding the exact duration of the suspension and when services will resume. Be Patient: Mainnet transitions can sometimes take longer than initially anticipated. Understand that the exchange is working to ensure the safety of your assets. Your Holdings Are Safe: Your G tokens held on Bithumb are generally safe during this process. The exchange manages the technical aspects of migrating your balance to the new mainnet. Challenges users might face include missing the deadline for transactions or uncertainty about the exact time services will be restored. Relying on official communication channels is key to overcoming this uncertainty. The Role of a Crypto Exchange During Upgrades This event highlights the crucial role that a Crypto Exchange like Bithumb plays in supporting the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. When projects undergo significant upgrades like a Mainnet Transition , exchanges act as intermediaries, handling the complex technical migration process on behalf of their users. This saves individual users the trouble of managing private keys or navigating complex migration tools themselves. Supporting mainnet swaps requires significant technical effort from the exchange’s side, involving developers and security teams working to ensure a seamless and secure transition for all user assets held on the platform. Conclusion The temporary Deposit Withdrawal Suspension for Gravity G on Bithumb , effective May 7th at 05:00 UTC, is a standard and necessary step to facilitate the project’s Mainnet Transition . While it means a brief interruption in service for G holders on the platform, it signals a significant step forward for the Gravity project itself. Users should ensure they complete any necessary transactions before the deadline and monitor Bithumb’s official channels for updates on service resumption. This process underscores the critical function of a reliable Crypto Exchange in managing complex network upgrades for its user base, ensuring the safety and integrity of digital assets during periods of significant technical change.

A planned meeting to discuss U.S. and China tariffs sent risk assets higher in the hours since the U.S. stock market closed on Wednesday, as reported , but those gains reversed as news of India’s “Operation Sindoor” emerged in the early hours. Traders expect to see more volatility in the days ahead as the regional tussles further damage risk-taking sentiment among traders, though eventually leading to a move higher as bitcoin is perceived as a hedge. “Volatility in the markets is soaring as bitcoin surges to $97K from the intensifying conflict between India and Pakistan,” Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “This is in addition to plans by the US and China to discuss a trade deal this week. This upward movement came as a surprise, as investors were de-risking positions ahead of a decision by the Fed about changing interest rates. Geopolitical uncertainty and macroeconomic volatility may send Bitcoin to new highs as a hedge against greater market risks,” Ruck added. Cardano’s ADA led gains among majors with a 3% bump in the past 24 hours, adding to gains from Tuesday. Dogecoin (DOGE), XRP, BNB Chain’s BNB and ether (ETH) added less than 2%, while legacy tokens Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Litecoin (LTC) surged as much as 10%. The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a liquid index tracking the largest tokens by market cap, added nearly 2%. Meanwhile, some traders said bitcoin’s surge in the past weeks was coupled with a spike in active addresses — a metric of wallet activity that some consider a sign of oncoming volatility. “Bitcoin’s recent rally to the $87,500–a spike in active addresses backs $97,500 range (now at a 6-month high) pointing to rising demand and renewed network activity,” Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “This surge supports a bullish case for a potential breakout toward $100K, though confirmation depends on multiple indicators aligning,” Lee said, mirroring separate analyst commentary from the past week. “Traders should also monitor macro conditions, Bitcoin dominance, currently nearing the 55% mark, and rising hash rates.

Lee, who is the Democratic Party’s presidential candidate, has rolled out a set of crypto-friendly promises as part of a larger pitch to win over younger voters, according to a Korea Economic Daily report. With the June 3 election approaching, Lee made it clear that digital assets would play a key role in his plans. In a social media post on May 6, Lee said he wants to help young people “[build] assets and plan for the future” by making crypto investment safer and more accessible. He pledged to push for the legalization of spot crypto ETFs, along with the creation of a unified oversight system to strengthen protections for investors and bring more transparency to the market. Among other reforms, Lee said he would work to reduce trading fees and overhaul current regulations, signaling a broader effort to make crypto a more stable and mainstream investment option for everyday users. Lee’s message seems aimed squarely at younger South Koreans who’ve been priced out of traditional assets like real estate and stocks and are turning to crypto in search of better returns.

With around 16 million crypto users, roughly 36% of the electorate , digital asset investors have become a major voting bloc. Politicians from both major parties are actively courting them . The Democratic Party has reportedly brought in a token securities expert, Professor Kim Yong-jin, to help shape policy, and one of its lawmakers recently introduced a draft bill dubbed the Digital Asset Promotion Basic Act. Meanwhile, the ruling People Power Party has laid out its own ambitious plan to support the crypto sector. Back in April, the party unveiled a seven-part strategy , including a commitment to approve spot Bitcoin ETFs this year. Further, it wants to scrap South Korea’s one-exchange-one-bank rule, allow institutions to trade crypto, and roll out a stablecoin regulatory framework in line with global standards. As previously reported by crypto.news, Representative Park Soo-min of the People Power Party said South Korea has “no time to delay” on ETFs, especially with jurisdictions like Hong Kong and the U.S. already moving ahead. The party is also pushing to set up a special crypto committee directly under their presidential candidate, Kim Moon-soo, who has spoken out about the lack of protection for the millions of Koreans now invested in digital assets.

44269642,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=394904,1746604475,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/44269642.jpeg,Inside 1inch with Aleksandra Fetisova: From Institutions and Memes to the Future of DeFi,https://cryptopotato.com/inside-1inch-with-aleksandra-fetisova-from-institutions-and-memes-to-the-future-of-defi/,"At the heart of DeFi innovation, 1inch has built one of the most popular decentralized exchange aggregators in the space. At Paris Blockchain Week 2025, we sat down with Aleksandra “Sasha” Fetisova, Head of Business Development at 1inch, to understand what’s next: for 1inch, DeFi, and the industry, in general. Sasha revealed the latest upgrades, challenges in the ecosystem, and the trends she believes will reshape DeFi over the next few years. Reinventing the Swap Experience For those unfamiliar, 1inch doesn’t operate like a traditional DEX — it’s a DEX aggregator. Instead of providing a standalone marketplace, it scans hundreds of decentralized exchanges to deliver the best possible rates to its users. Recent updates, Sasha explained, have pushed this even further. “We improved our swap experience with an intent-based, cross-chain gasless solution called Fusion,” she said. “It’s interoperable across EVM chains, doesn’t rely on third-party bridges, and is protected against MEV [maximum extractable value] attacks. It’s all about making swaps faster, cheaper, and safer.” For regular users, this means lower friction and lower cost, particularly when moving assets across chains — a pain point that’s long plagued decentralized finance. Fees are a sensitive topic in crypto, where gas costs and platform cuts can quietly drain portfolios. “Our users can be sure they’re doing direct swaps without any added fees,” Sasha emphasized. “We’re a community-driven project, and we don’t charge users on our DApp or mobile wallet.” Behind the scenes, she credits the project’s developers for optimizing routing and smart contracts to keep swaps efficient and cheap. But that’s not the only factor: “We aggregate liquidity from over 500 DEXs across 10 to 13 chains,” she said. “Plus, in Fusion mode, we work with professional market makers — resolvers — who pull liquidity not just from decentralized sources but also from centralized exchanges.” Security Through Minimalism One feature of 1inch’s approach is its laser focus on security. “We’ve never been hacked,” Sasha stated firmly. “That’s because we do at least five to ten audits every time we update or launch something new.” But it’s not just audits. She pointed to co-founder and CTO Anton Bukov’s philosophy of writing minimal, highly efficient smart contracts. “Instead of creating bloated, complex code, Anton spends hours thinking and then writes a small, functional piece of code — something that can be audited quickly and runs efficiently,” she explained. “It’s a very intentional design.” Going Global: From Decentralized Team to Dubai Hub Although 1inch was born during the remote-work explosion of COVID, the team recently opened its first physical office in Dubai. “We see the IMEA region as very fruitful, especially under current market conditions,” Sasha shared. “If our community is traveling to Dubai, we’re happy to show them around!” She hinted that Dubai’s choice aligns with favorable conditions for crypto innovation. Looking beyond 1inch’s immediate roadmap, Sasha reflected on the broader trends shaping DeFi. “In the next cycle, we’ll see more institutions entering DeFi,” she predicted. “We’re already seeing centralized exchanges like Binance and OKX launching Web3 wallets, and even banks — like Societe Generale with its FORGE platform — exploring DeFi integrations.” On the more chaotic side of the market, she acknowledged the rise of meme coins. “When Trump launched his meme coin, it brought in a lot of new users, but many of them got wrecked,” she said. “I’d love to see some kind of education or maybe even system notifications warning people that meme coins are meme coins — they’re not guaranteed wealth machines.” Real-World Assets and AI: The Next Frontiers Sasha is particularly excited about the tokenization of real-world assets. “I met someone who tokenized mangoes for an African central bank — can you imagine?” she said, laughing. “We’re going to see more real estate tokenization, hedge fund tokenization… These are the trends that could bring the first billion users into crypto.” And what about onboarding those billions? “We need AI agents,” Sasha asserted. “Imagine an AI assistant in the 1inch wallet that guides new users, answers their questions, and helps them navigate features. I can only help maybe 100 people a day; an AI agent can help thousands, 24/7.” Towards the end of April, 1inch had a major announcement: its expansion to Solana. “We’re not just EVM-compatible anymore; we’re expanding to Layer 1s, and we invite users to guess which chains are coming next.” The post Inside 1inch with Aleksandra Fetisova: From Institutions and Memes to the Future of DeFi appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto News|Interviews|DeFi,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|BNB,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-05-07 07:54:35

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Dogecoin may dominate the memes and ride bullish waves, but Remittix is quietly building real-world momentum that could reshape the payments game for good. Table of Contents Remittix takes on $250t payments market Dogecoin bounce signals a meme-fueled rally again PEPE’s push is real but can it outpace DOGE and RTX? Conclusion Once a joke, now a juggernaut, Dogecoin has defied the odds time and again. Backed by memes, Elon Musk and a cult-like community, DOGE has carved out a permanent seat at crypto’s top table. With recent price action hinting at a breakout, many traders are betting that Dogecoin will leave relatively new tokens like PEPE in the dust. But there’s a twist in this tale. Remittix (RTX), a rising PayFi protocol priced under 10 cents, isn’t here to play meme games. While DOGE rides waves of sentiment, Remittix is locking in real-world use, enabling crypto-to-fiat transfers straight to bank accounts, instantly. Backed by a booming $14.7m presale and Ethereum’s credibility, it’s attracting serious investor attention. DOGE may have the brand and the buzz to beat PEPE, but read on to find out why Remittix could outpace them both. Remittix takes on $250t payments market For all its memes and momentum, Dogecoin still isn’t solving one of the world’s biggest financial headaches: cross-border payments. The $183 trillion banking sector, despite its size, still leans on outdated rails, with delays, hidden fees and intermediaries that make international transfers a logistical nightmare. Remittix bridges traditional finance and blockchain, enabling users to send crypto that lands directly into local bank accounts as fiat, without the need for correspondent banks or middlemen. This is in stark contrast to platforms like Stripe and Wise, which stop at fiat rails. It’s faster, cheaper and smarter. Transactions clear in seconds and fees are transparent and minimal, unlike the unpredictable costs of banks and legacy services. While DOGE is fun and speculative, Remittix delivers on functionality, unlocking global payments for the next generation of crypto users. That’s not just innovation. It’s a disruption. You might also like: Cardano, Dogecoin, and Remittix feature as analysts pick most undervalued cryptos Dogecoin bounce signals a meme-fueled rally again Dogecoin ( DOGE ) price action is flashing bullish signals, according to a growing number of crypto analysts. Trader Tardigrade, a respected chart watcher on Crypto X, recently noted that Dogecoin has “consistently found support at previous swing highs.” Most recently, it rebounded from a level that aligns with Q4 2023’s highs, just like before a massive run last year. This technical pattern suggests Dogecoin may have completed its pullback and could enter its next major wave. If history repeats, DOGE could skyrocket as high as $0.80 before August, with some ultra-bulls even eyeing $1.10. Source: X, formerly Twitter Despite lagging behind Bitcoin over the past year, Dogecoin has a habit of surprising the market with rapid rallies, especially when memecoin hype returns. Analysts like Bitcoinsensus and Muro Crypto believe the next DOGE pump could spark the broader altseason. PEPE’s push is real but can it outpace DOGE and RTX? While Dogecoin may be the market’s meme king, Pepe Coin ( PEPE ) is quietly building a case for the crown. According to UniChartz, PEPE respects a rising trendline with textbook precision, a signal of strong, sustained bullish control. Technicals are heating up, too. UniChartz notes that the MACD has flipped positive, suggesting bullish momentum is gaining strength. If PEPE breaks cleanly above its 100 EMA, currently acting as a ceiling, it could unlock a sharp rally toward the $0.00001152 mark, with $0.00001313 and even $0.00001731 in sight. Source: X.com Despite these promising signs, DOGE maintains a stronger position in the meme coin market. DOGE’s established presence and recent technical patterns suggest it may continue to outperform newer entrants like PEPE in the near term. Conclusion Dogecoin’s staying power and bullish chart setup give it a clear edge over Pepe Coin, which still battles key resistance zones. However, DOGE may face stiff competition from RTX, a rising star already selling out fast, with 66.56% of its token allocation gone and nearly 531 million RTX sold. Even as Dogecoin holds strong among memecoin fanatics, with this level of demand and hype, RTX could be the real disruptor this year. To learn more about Remittix, visit the website and socials.

By 2028, AAVE could reach a maximum price of $829.30. In 2031, AAVE will range between $2,006 to $2,476. Aave is a leading decentralized finance ( DeFi ) protocol on the Ethereum blockchain .

Participants in the Aave ecosystem can deposit their digital crypto assets back into liquidity pools to earn their interest payments or obtain loans by borrowing funds without providing collateral. Aave’s governance and fee distribution are significantly driven by its native token, AAVE, enhancing its utility and value within the platform. Having touched its ATH at $666.86 in May 2021, how much will AAVE be worth in 2025? Is AAVE worth holding? Let’s get into the Aave technical analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Aave Ticker AAVE Current price $174.03 Market cap $2.78B Trading volume (24-h) $262.09M Circulating supply 15,106,580.63 AAVE All-time high $666.86 on May 19, 2021 All-time low $26.02 on Nov 5, 2020 24-hour low $163.77 24-hour high $179.66 Aave price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 10.89% 50-day SMA $164.09 14-Day RSI 60.72 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 67 (Greed) Green days 16/30 (53%) 200-Day SMA $217.64 Aave 1-day price analysis: AAVE faces resistance at $189 Key takeaways AAVE loses momentum, down 2.13%. Key support lies at $164.30. MACD shows that bullish momentum is still intact despite reduced upside. Aave 1-day price chart: AAVE’s rally is pausing, bulls look cautious Per the price analysis on May 7, AAVE is facing mild selling pressure, down 2.13% to $174, after failing to break above the upper Bollinger Band ($189). The RSI at 59.2 hints at fading bullish strength — still neutral but cooling off from overbought levels. AAVE ’s rally is pausing, bulls look cautious MACD remains positive, showing the uptrend isn’t broken yet, but the histogram bars are shrinking, signaling momentum is slowing. Support lies around the mid-Bollinger band at $164; a dip below could invite more sellers. AAVE’s rally is pausing, bulls look cautious, and unless $180+ is reclaimed soon, the price may drift lower toward support. Aave 4-hour price chart: The coin is stuck near $174 On the 4-hour chart, AAVE is showing clear hesitation. The price is stuck near $174, hovering around the Alligator’s lines, which are tight and flat — meaning no clear trend. AAVE is stuck near $174 The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) at -0.05 hints at slight capital outflows, while the Balance of Power at -0.31 confirms that bears are subtly in control. No big breakdown yet, but the bulls are definitely on the back foot. A push above $176 might revive momentum, while a drop below $172 will confirm sellers stepping in. Aave technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $163.97 BUY SMA 5 $174.50 SELL SMA 10 $173.74 BUY SMA 21 $162.65 BUY SMA 50 $164.09 BUY SMA 100 $200.31 SELL SMA 200 $217.64 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $156.99 BUY EMA 5 $152.15 BUY EMA 10 $152.15 BUY EMA 21 $160.51 BUY EMA 50 $185.43 SELL EMA 100 $209.68 SELL EMA 200 $208.17 SELL AAVE price analysis conclusion AAVE is currently stuck in a consolidation phase, with momentum fading. Indicators show weakening buying pressure and indecision, hinting at a potential pullback if bulls don’t step up soon. A break below $173 could trigger further downside while reclaiming $180 is key for a bullish push. Is AAVE a good investment? Aave provides the essential infrastructure for lending and borrowing within DeFi, expanding beyond traditional applications into gaming, NFTs, and dApps. Its AAVE token plays a vital role in powering the platform, making it a strong choice for investors due to its proven market success and continuous development. Where to buy AAVE? AAVE tokens can be traded on centralized crypto exchanges. The most popular exchange to buy and trade Aave is Binance , one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, offering a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Coinbase, ByBit, OKX, Kraken and KuCoin also support AAVE. Why is AAVE down? The AAVE price candles show a price decline after facing rejection at the $179.65 resistance level. AAVE is now pushing to hold the $172.01 support level. AAVE price history | Coinmarketcap Will Aave reach $500? Aave (AAVE) can potentially reach $500 if it breaks through the current resistance levels and gains momentum from positive market sentiment and trends. AAVE had previously reached an ATH of $666.86; attaining $500 should be an achievable feat in the near term if market conditions align. Does Aave have a good long-term future? Aave shows potential for a good long-term future, given its ability to stabilize and recover after significant declines. The consistent support of around $116 indicates resilience and potential for future growth.

In a recent post on the social media platform X, Vet highlighted the poor state of user experience in XRPL applications and criticized the excessive technical barriers users must overcome to engage with decentralized platforms. XRP Ledger App complexity is not getting better. Unfortunately an issue in whole crypto. Handicapped by all the different layer 1, bad UI UX experiences and difficult interoperability. You want to use an XRPL App? Here's a 20h developer tutorial, download this GitHub… — Vet (@Vet_X0) May 5, 2025 According to Vet, the app ecosystem remains difficult to use despite the XRPL’s reputation for speed and efficiency . He noted that the process of engaging with even a single application on the ledger typically requires users to undergo extensive developer onboarding. Vet described a scenario in which users must dedicate significant time, such as 20 hours of developer tutorials, to understand how to interact with an application. He also pointed out the necessity of downloading code repositories from GitHub and grasping advanced XRPL concepts such as trustlines, which serve as a fundamental component for enabling token interactions on the network. Interface Design and Warnings Create Friction VET’s commentary also criticized the application interfaces, noting the prevalence of confusing layouts. He emphasized that excessive pop-ups and warnings may discourage non-technical users. He characterized these issues as part of a wider trend in the blockchain space, where projects are hindered by fragmented infrastructure, poor interoperability between protocols, and a lack of user-centered design. The user experience is further compromised by inconsistent design choices and unclear instructions, often overwhelming even those with some technical background. For everyday users unfamiliar with the XRPL’s design principles, these factors form a substantial barrier to entry. VET emphasized that such problems are not exclusive to XRPL but are common across the decentralized ecosystem. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A Decade of Minimal Progress in UX In response to a comment from another X user, Krippenreiter, who observed that the poor UX of XRPL apps has remained largely unchanged for over a decade, Vet acknowledged that the issue is not exclusive to the XRP Ledger. He emphasized that the technological landscape became more complex as the blockchain industry evolved beyond Bitcoin. This has contributed to the stagnation of meaningful improvements in usability. While some progress has been made, VET stated that many projects in the space fail to prioritize user experience. The discussion reflects a broader frustration among long-term observers of the industry who believe that blockchain applications are not progressing at a pace that aligns with increasing adoption goals. Although XRPL is known for features such as fast settlement and low transaction fees, these technical advantages are undermined by inadequate accessibility and interface design. Vet’s remarks exposed a critical gap between protocol-level efficiency and user-level engagement. Industry-Wide Complexity Stalls Adoption Efforts The lack of streamlined interfaces, consistent standards, and educational resources prevents widespread adoption of decentralized applications, not just on XRPL but across all major Layer 1 platforms. According to Vet, the complexity stems not just from poor design choices but also from the nature of the industry, grown to include a wide range of protocols, smart contract systems, and governance models, each adding layers of difficulty for developers and users alike. As calls grow louder for improved interoperability, clearer standards, and more intuitive design in crypto, the criticism from a known XRPL validator underscores the urgency of addressing these persistent shortcomings. Without substantive improvements to usability, XRPL and other blockchain platforms may struggle to attract and retain mainstream users, regardless of their technical capabilities.

Binance’s questionnaire covered a wide variety of security topics — while the results of the survey point to both increased awareness of security issues in the Asian markets as well as a high degree of trust in existing security measures. Some 40.7% of survey participants reported having experienced some form of exposure to crypto-related scams . In terms of the channels used to propagate these malicious ploys, X, Telegram, and Facebook seem to be the most commonly used — with 57%, 51.2%, and 46.5% users identifying these platforms as being leveraged to spread scam information in their regions. Social media platforms most commonly used to disseminate scams. Source: Binance Binance survey reveals users want real-time monitoring, public databases to strengthen crypto security Over half of the traders who answered the survey — 53.4%, to be exact — stated that they would immediately contact the exchange in the event of a scam. Moreover, some 84% said that they trust protections such as Binance’s emergency fund, SAFU. At present, 80.5% of queried users have the exchange’s 2-factor authentication (2FA) feature enabled — while 34.9% maintain a separate trading password. In contrast, only 10.9% of users forgo any additional security features. Data regarding enabled security measures. Source: Binance When it comes to future improvements, active, real-time monitoring on the part of exchanges, as well as access to public databases, seem to be priorities for cryptocurrency investors in Asia. Some 62.5% of respondents highlighted real-time interception of high-risk transactions as a security feature they would like to see exchanges strengthen, while 49.4% called for the establishment of public databases that would contain suspicious addresses Data regarding security measures users would like to see improved. Source: Binance In addition, the survey highlights a disparity between experienced crypto users and novices — with a full third of users still storing their private keys on internet-connected devices, a figure that climbs to 42% in Southeast Asia. Education remains a critical pillar of security, but there is evidently a need for improvement — as 55.8% of users find existing materials “too technical and hard to understand”, while 39.7% have stated a preference for localized, real-life case studies.

A new blockchain from ex- Monero developers is betting that privacy, playful crypto mining, and a dose of nostalgia can win over the next wave of crypto users, launching as a standalone proof-of-work network where anyone with a Mac or PC can mine its native Tari crypto under the XTM ticker, shield their balances from public view, and join a growing community of over 700,000 airdrop participants. Tari’s flagship app, Tari Universe, transforms mining into a visual experience — complete with real-time feedback, power usage sliders, and one-click controls that let users pause or throttle how much of their CPU is used. Mining is split between SHA3x and RandomX algorithms, with block rewards distributed 50/50 between standalone and merge miners. “Tari Universe turns your computer into a money machine. It works by harnessing your computers computational power to solve blocks on the Tari network. In doing so, you’re helping to secure the Tari network while earning Tari token (XTM) rewards.” Tari Tari’s emission model begins with a 21 billion XTM supply, of which 30% is pre-mined, per data from the official website. The rest — 14.7 billion tokens — is reserved for public mining, with rewards decreasing gradually on a per-block basis. A 1% tail emission ensures ongoing miner incentives after the first 12 years.

Tari’s tokenomics | Source: Tari The pre-mined portion is allocated to infrastructure (9%), community programs (5%), contributors (4%), and early participants (12%), with long vesting periods starting six to twelve months post-mainnet. The network uses a two-token system: XTM powers the base layer (called Minotari), while XTR operates on the second layer (dubbed Ootle). Users can burn XTM 1:1 to mint XTR via a dynamic “Throttle” mechanism, which adjusts minting costs based on demand, while fees burned during activity help manage supply. The balance between XTM and XTR is designed to tighten over time, though actual usage patterns remain to be seen.

But seasoned investors know that real gains aren’t always made at the top—they’re made by spotting hidden gems before the crowd catches on. Right now, with Bitcoin drawing attention, lesser-known altcoins like Dawgz AI are quietly gaining momentum. This moment offers a valuable window to load up on high-potential tokens still flying under the radar. In this post, we’ll highlight the best crypto to buy now that could deliver outsized returns as the market turns bullish again, plus smart strategies to get ahead of the next rally. Why This Dip Matters The crypto market never rises in a straight line. Even as Bitcoin charts its way to $100K, dips occur—but they present key opportunities for informed investors. What makes “buying the dip” effective? Cost-efficient entries: Purchasing tokens during dips ensures lower entry prices. Timing market shifts: By identifying solid projects now, you position yourself to benefit during the next wave of capital inflows. Momentum builds with Bitcoin: When Bitcoin gains momentum, quality altcoins often follow suit, enabling exponential growth in smaller-cap projects. Now is the time to spot undervalued cryptos that have tangible use cases, strong communities, and active development. Below, we’ll focus on three high-potential projects you shouldn’t overlook. What to Look for When Buying Crypto in a Dip Not every crypto is a good dip-buy candidate. To avoid losses, it’s essential to assess the following factors before making any investment decision. 1. Utility and Use Case Is this token solving a real-world problem? Cryptos with practical applications will typically fare better over long-term cycles. 2. Active Development Projects with consistent updates and innovation signal dedication and long-term focus from their team. 3. Community Backing A strong, loyal community keeps a project alive even during market lulls. Platforms like Discord, Telegram, and X (formerly Twitter) are great indicators of activity. 4. Sound Tokenomics A balanced supply and distribution model ensures price stability and incentivizes growth. Look for projects with transparent token releases and no excessive dilution. 5. Scalable Market Cap Projects with low market caps but strong fundamentals often deliver significant upside. Early-stage investment opportunities can bring the highest returns. Keeping these factors in mind, here are the best cryptos to buy now during the dip.

How to Position Yourself Before Bitcoin Hits $100K This dip won’t last forever. Bitcoin’s rally to $100K could trigger surging altcoin markets, driving prices sky-high. Here’s how you can prepare smartly for the next bull market. 1. Diversify Your Holdings Don’t put all your money into one token. Instead, balance your portfolio across different categories like AI-powered projects, privacy-focused tools, and infrastructure-based tokens. 2. Start Staking Take advantage of staking opportunities now. Early staking options, especially from Dawgz AI, offer additional income streams even before the market picks up momentum again. 3. Monitor Volume and Sentiment Use tools like CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap to study token trends, including price movement and volume surges. Early signs of investor confidence often signal when to increase your allocation. 4. Avoid Panic Buys It can be tempting to chase rising coins, but dips like these are where most gains are made. Stick to buying undervalued projects early. Act Before the Next Bull Run Market pullbacks are rare opportunities to build wealth by accumulating tokens with serious long-term potential. Dawgz AI in particular offers the perfect combination of innovation, community focus, and price entry levels under $0.01. Don’t wait for prices to skyrocket. Make your move today by visiting Dawgz AI. FAQ Section Which crypto can give 1000x in 2025?

No rate change might keep Bitcoin stuck in current range. Rate hike could push Bitcoin down toward key support zones. On May 7, 2025, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will wrap up its two-day meeting, making a key decision that could have an impact on both the stock and cryptocurrency markets. The focus will be on whether Jerome Powell and the FOMC choose to adjust interest rates. With President Trump vocal about his stance, there’s a 97% chance, according to the CME FedWatch Tool, that the FOMC will keep rates unchanged at 4.50%.

Despite rising interest in digital assets, current Basel Committee rules are pushing banks to the sidelines of a market they say they are eager to enter, according to a report by The Banker . Arnab Sen, CEO of GFO-X, a UK-based digital asset derivatives exchange, warned that regulatory constraints are preventing traditional financial institutions from participating in crypto markets. Speaking at the Financial Times’ Digital Assets Summit in London, Sen said, “The market is crying out for banks to intermediate Bitcoin trading and collateral services, but the existing rules make it almost impossible.” Basel Rules Treat Bitcoin as High-Risk Asset At the heart of the issue is the Basel framework, which assigns a 1,250% risk weight to unhedged crypto holdings such as Bitcoin—essentially treating the asset as highly speculative. This classification significantly increases the amount of capital banks must hold to support such exposures, rendering the business case unattractive. “These rules are freezing banks out of the space,” Sen said in an interview with The Banker . “There’s strong demand from institutional clients, but it’s just not viable for banks under current regulations.” This regulatory bottleneck is driving trading activity toward unregulated platforms or non-bank intermediaries, raising concerns about market oversight and systemic risk. $1.6 TRILLION BANK OF AMERICA’S CEO SAYS US BANKING INDUSTRY WILL SOON EMBRACE CRYPTO FOR PAYMENTS IT’S HAPPENING pic.twitter.com/PrNDFI6k9x — Vivek (@Vivek4real_) January 26, 2025 Sen noted that conversations are already underway among global regulators to revisit the treatment of Bitcoin under Basel rules. He expressed optimism that changes could be on the horizon. “I believe the Basel approach will be reviewed this year,” he said during a panel discussion on institutional crypto adoption. “There’s lobbying underway because institutional demand is growing rapidly.” Marcus Robinson, head of CDSClear and DigitalAssetClear at the London Stock Exchange Group, echoed these sentiments, saying institutions are showing “increasing interest and comfort” with crypto. Institutions Eyeing Crypto-Backed Lending Roger Bayston, head of digital assets at Franklin Templeton, added that firms are especially exploring ways to lend against crypto assets. Sen pointed to the recent repeal of SAB 121 in the U.S.—which had imposed accounting burdens on crypto custodians—as a key turning point that could open doors for banks to provide custody services. He described the repeal as “the first step” toward broader institutional participation. “The next intellectual step,” Sen said, “is to rethink how Bitcoin is treated on bank balance sheets.” According to a recent survey by Coinbase and EY-Parthenon , 86% of institutional investors surveyed said they had exposure to digital assets or planned to make allocations to cryptocurrencies in 2025. Besides, thanks to the evolving regulatory landscape worldwide, institutions are increasingly viewing cryptocurrencies as a legitimate component of a balanced investment strategy. Gadi Chait, Investment Manager at Xapo Bank, said in a recent interview that historically, institutional investors have been deterred by several factors, particularly crypto volatility concerns. However, he added that with more awareness and research, investors are understanding the varying degrees of risk and utility.

The meme coin sector momentarily slowed down, hinting at a potential rally if the broader market stabilizes after its recent downturn. Specifically, PEPE coin prices display a bullish pattern, presenting an opportunity for a breakout based on the daily chart analysis. Moreover, the volatility of meme coins is exacerbated by the prevailing market uncertainty. This causes fluctuations in PEPE prices as they oscillate in search of a solid support level to initiate a recovery. Considering investing in Pepe crypto?

The hourly price chart confirms that Pepe attempts to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a further recovery rally in the coming hours. If Pepe’s price holds momentum above $0.00000846, it will fuel a bullish rally to $0.00000982. PEPE/USD chart If bulls fail to initiate a surge, Pepe’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.00000753, beginning a bearish trend to $0.00000587. Is PEPE A Good Investment? Reviewing the Pepe project’s roadmap, it appears there are no detailed plans other than anticipation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate. Given this lack of clear direction and with an already sizable community of over 500,000 Twitter followers, the project’s price growth potential may be capped. However, meme coins have a reputation for offering significant returns, as their values can surge dramatically when supported by strong community movements. This was evident when Pepe’s value skyrocketed by over 222% to reach a new all-time high (ATH) following its listing on the Binance exchange. A similar significant announcement in 2025 could propel Pepe to surpass its previous ATH. Why is Pepe down today? Pepe’s price failed to gain buying demand above $0.000008. As a result, sellers gained control and plunged the price below the immediate Fib levels to strengthen their domination. Will Pepe Recover? If buyers push above the $0.00001 level strongly, we might see a recovery rally in the Pepe price chart. What is Pepe price prediction for 2025? The Pepe price prediction for 2025 expects the meme coin to record a maximum level of $0.000035. Will Pepe price reach $0.01? Pepe’s price might touch the $0.01 mark by the end of 2029. However, this price milestone entirely depends on the utility of Pepe coin and future buying demand. Will Pepe price reach $1? Pepe has a great community, and the hype is high for the meme coin. If everything remains good, we might see Pepe’s price touch $1 soon or by 2040.

Month Potential low ($) Potential average ($) Potential high ($) May 2025 0.0000059 0.0000072 0.0000098 Pepe price prediction 2025 The Pepe roadmap is somewhat vague, with few definitive plans beyond the expectation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate the market. Despite its robust community, this lack of clear direction might cap the project’s price potential. Meme coins have a reputation for offering significant financial returns, as their values can surge rapidly when supported by their communities. The impact of major announcements was evident when Pepe’s value soared by more than 222% following its listing on the Binance exchange, reaching an all-time high. A similar event in 2025 could potentially send Pepe to new peaks. In 2025, Pepe’s minimum expected price is projected to be $0.000005.

According to price data from crypto.news, Maple Finance’s ( SYRUP ) token hit an intraday high of $0.29 yesterday, May 6, putting it up more than 240% from last month’s low. At press time, its price had pulled back some of its gains and settled at $0.23, with its market cap around $253 million. SYRUP’s latest bounce occurred in a high-volume environment, with 24-hour trading volume up 2,400% to nearly $177 million. The hype extended beyond spot markets, with open interest in SYRUP futures soaring 2,400% in a single day to a record $6.72 million. A major catalyst for the rally was SYRUP’s listing on Binance and Bitget on May 6. While deposits opened immediately, withdrawals from both platforms are scheduled to begin today at 15:00 UTC. Listings on major exchanges such as Binance and Bitget tend to act as price catalysts by significantly enhancing token accessibility, market depth, and investor participation.

According to DeFiLlama data , Maple’s total value locked hit a new all-time high of $1.26 billion on May 7, up over 180% since the start of 2025, signalling growing trust and adoption in the platform’s ecosystem.

The 20-day EMA (blue) has crossed above the 50-day EMA (green), forming what traders call a “golden cross,” a signal that momentum is shifting in favor of the bulls. SYRUP price, 20-day and 50-day EMA chart — May 7 | Source: crypto.news At the same time, the Bull Bear Power indicator showed seven straight green candles, suggesting buyers have been dominating recently. On top of that, the Supertrend indicator has flipped green, reinforcing the bullish setup. SYRUP Supertrend and Bull Bear Power chart — May 7 | Source: crypto.news With this setup, SYRUP could be on track to retest the $0.30 psychological resistance, which it fell just short of in yesterday’s rally. A successful break above that could see it surpass its all-time high of $0.33, potentially opening the door for a move toward the $0.40 level if momentum stays strong. However, traders should watch out for a potential short-term pullback. The Relative Strength Index is currently at overbought levels, meaning SYRUP could see a cooldown or some profit-taking before trying for its next leg up.

However, in the most recent cycle, Bitcoin has shown a stronger correlation with risk assets rather than acting as a hedge. Under Trump’s administration, the push to legalize crypto positioned it as a “satellite asset” for excess USD liquidity. Furthermore, market participation has also shifted from retail investors to institutions. Bitcoin is currently experiencing lower volatility as the world sees mainstream adoption of crypto. Consequently, crypto’s independent cycles have weakened, increasingly syncing with global macro trends and resembling tech stocks with longer, smoother cycles driven by innovation. Influenced by his real estate background and his philosophy of “Leverage: don’t make deals without it”, Trump appears to be using layoffs and reduced government contracts (e.g., the DOGE initiative) to artificially create signs of recession in the data, thereby potentially pulling stocks into retracement. This strategy could pressure the Federal Reserve to cut rates. In this article, we review current U.S. dollar liquidity and the implementation of Trump-era policies, and outline relevant risk management indicators. https://en.macromicro.me/collections/4/us-employ-relative/126695/us-number-of-jobs-elon-and-doge-cut-in-2025 Major Drivers This Cycle: Legalization & Dollarization of Crypto Unlike past cycles propelled by catalysts such as DeFi (2020) or ICOs (2017), this current cycle is driven by a regulatory shift— moving from SEC crackdowns towards government support and the proposed Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The dollarization of crypto continues, acting as both an opportunity and a risk. Bitcoin, while strongly correlated with U.S. equities, previously demonstrated independent four-year cycles. The 2022 Russia-Ukraine conflict provides a notable exception, where capital controls and sanctions triggered a 12% single-day surge in Bitcoin as investors sought a hedge against fiat currency devaluation. However, more recent geopolitical events—such as the Israel-Gaza conflict and last week’s geopolitical challenges—have resulted in sharp declines in Bitcoin’s price. https://en.macromicro.me/collections/4/us-employ-relative/126695/us-number-of-jobs-elon-and-doge-cut-in-2025 Institutional investors have now become the primary drivers of Bitcoin’s price movements. This can be demonstrated by CME data, where the open interest in CME Bitcoin futures has surged from under $4 billion prior to the approval of ETFs to a consistent level above $10 billion— even reaching peaks exceeding $20 billion. A significant liquidation of basis arbitrage positions by U.S. institutions could potentially trigger a sharp price decline due to outflows from spot ETFs. This arbitrage strategy involves capitalizing on the price difference (basis) between spot ETFs and futures contracts using leverage of 3–5x. For instance, investors might take a long position in the spot ETF while simultaneously shorting CME futures, profiting from a basis that exceeds the U.S. Treasury yield (approximately 5%), thus aiming for a risk-free arbitrage. Currently, Bitcoin’s behavior mirrors that of a 3x leveraged Nasdaq: during periods of abundant liquidity, it experiences even more substantial gains than the Nasdaq, while periods of tightening liquidity lead to even more pronounced losses. https://www.coinglass.com/zh On the other hand, if we say the current beta of Nasdaq tech stocks is AI—exemplified by the upcoming release of GPT-5 and Nvidia’s monopoly — the beta of the crypto industry remains institutional inflows driven by regulatory legitimization and dollarization. Outside of memecoins, the sector has yet to see a sustainable beta like DeFi in the last cycle. Nevertheless, according to DeFiLlama, there are over 20 on-chain projects generating more than $100 million in annualized revenue. https://defillama.com Legalization and dollarization are the defining core tailwinds of this cycle. Bitcoin stands as the primary beneficiary, acting as a gateway for U.S. institutional capital through ETFs, thereby solidifying the long-term legitimacy of the U.S. crypto industry. This process is expected to generate a continuous stream of positive news and regulatory developments. However, despite this bullish trend, Bitcoin’s price will remain susceptible to short-term volatility influenced by geopolitical events and macroeconomic factors, such as changes in global liquidity. Investors aiming to maximize profits from this long-term trend should consider holding mainstream crypto assets (like Bitcoin) and selling when the core drivers reach peak impact. For risk-averse investors, closely monitoring U.S. crypto policy developments and key liquidity indicators is advisable. Expect the evolution of U.S. crypto policy to unfold throughout the entirety of a second Trump term. Proposals to finance large-scale Bitcoin purchases—similar to the accumulation of gold during the Great Depression—will require fiscal maneuvering, potentially including engineering negative GDP prints to justify monetary stimulus. Until then, the U.S. does not have an official budget allocated for sovereign Bitcoin purchases. https://en.macromicro.me/collections/4/us-employ-relative/126695/us-number-of-jobs-elon-and-doge-cut-in-2025 Trump’s Crypto Policy Execution Implemented Policies 1. The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) Progress: FIT21 is legislation crafted to establish a well-defined regulatory framework for digital assets in the United States. Its core objective is to clarify the roles of regulatory agencies—the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)—in supervising the crypto industry. Highly decentralized cryptocurrencies (with control ≤ 20%), such as ETH and SOL, would be classified as digital commodities under the CFTC’s jurisdiction. In contrast, centralized assets would fall under the SEC’s authority. The bill also incorporates a 3- to 5-year safe harbor proposal to assist projects in transitioning to a decentralized structure. Despite its passage by the House of Representatives in May 2024, the FIT21 bill still requires several more steps before it can become law. Nevertheless, given the upswell of support for it in the new administration and Congress, along with the backing of key industry players such as Coinbase and Digital Currency Group, FIT21 seems poised to become the framework for regulation of digital assets. Key Impacts: ● Market Structure Optimization : A significant number of blockchain projects will transition to CFTC regulation, thereby reducing compliance costs. For example, the Ethereum Foundation has submitted proof of decentralization, anticipating reclassification by Q2 2025. ● Innovation Incentive: The safe harbor proposal is attracting numerous new projects; several DeFi protocols within the Solana ecosystem are currently undergoing compliance-related transformations. 2. Repeal of SAB 121 Policy Implementation: In January 2025, the Trump administration, utilizing expedited congressional procedures, repealed SAB 121. This regulation had previously required banks to classify customer cryptocurrency assets as liabilities on their balance sheets, effectively hindering the provision of custodial services by traditional financial institutions. Following the repeal, major banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup announced the launch of cryptocurrency custody services, projecting over $50 billion in assets under management by the end of Q2 2025. Market Reaction: ● Institutional Liquidity Injection: The opening of bank custody channels led to a surge in inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs. For example, a BlackRock product saw net inflows of $1.2 billion within a week. 3. SEC Regulatory Adjustments Personnel Changes: Following President Trump’s inauguration, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler resigned. He was replaced by crypto-friendly Paul S. Atkins. The new leadership is expected to prioritize revising the Howey Test criteria to reduce the proportion of tokens classified as securities and to promote a regulatory framework that is more open and innovation-friendly. Regulatory Relaxation: ● Howey Test Adjustment: The new regulatory approach is considering clarifying which functional tokens may be exempt from securities registration, such as tokens used for gas fees or Ethereum staking rewards. ● ETF Expansion: Beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, discussions have included the potential for ADA, SOL, and XRP within strategic reserves. However, to maintain Bitcoin’s primacy as a strategic asset, their inclusion is less likely. Nonetheless, the market demand for ETFs on these altcoins is significant, making their approval a distinct possibility. https://www.theblockbeats.info 4. Cryptocurrency Company Listings and Capitalization Reopening of the IPO Window: ● Kraken plans to launch its IPO on the NYSE in Q3 2025, with a valuation exceeding $20 billion, underwritten by Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. ● Fireblocks is planning a Nasdaq listing via a SPAC merger, with an estimated valuation of approximately $9 billion. Entry of Traditional Capital: ● Several Wall Street investment banks (such as Morgan Stanley) have established dedicated cryptocurrency investment divisions and led Coinbase’s secondary offering. ● Sovereign wealth funds are also entering the market. For example, ADQ, an Abu Dhabi investment fund, has increased its stake in MicroStrategy by 5%, indirectly gaining exposure to Bitcoin. Unfulfilled Policies Fed Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Act Key provisions of the act include: ● Bitcoin Purchase Plan: Acquire up to 200,000 BTC annually for five years, ultimately capping the federal Bitcoin reserve at 1 million BTC, which would be about 5% of Bitcoin’s total supply. ● Secure Storage Facilities: Establish a decentralized network of secure Bitcoin storage facilities managed by the U.S. Department of the Treasury for the safe storage and flexible management of Bitcoin reserves. ● Holding Period and Usage Rules: Bitcoin acquired by the government will be held for no less than 20 years, and no Bitcoin held may be sold, swapped, or auctioned for any purpose other than to retire outstanding federal debt instruments during this period. Funding Sources: ● Direct Budgetary Appropriations: Congress could allocate funds to buy Bitcoin through the standard appropriation process. This would increase government spending, either contributing to the national deficit or necessitating budget cuts in other areas.Given the potential multi-billion dollar cost, direct appropriation is likely to face political opposition. Without a strong fiscal justification (e.g., expected high returns for debt repayment), this approach is unlikely to gain support from fiscally hawkish members of Congress. ● Reallocation and Diversification of Existing Reserve Assets: A more creative approach involves utilizing the appreciation of existing government assets to purchase Bitcoin, minimizing new spending. The BITCOIN Act proposed by Lummis exemplifies this, suggesting leveraging the unrealized gains on the U.S. gold reserve: 1. The US Treasury holds approximately 261 million troy ounces of gold, which is still valued at a historical price of $42.22 per ounce on financial statements. The current market price is significantly higher, representing substantial unrealized gains. 2. The BITCOIN Act proposes that the Federal Reserve returns gold certificates to the Treasury, revaluing the gold at market price. The difference between the old and new certificate values would be transferred to the Treasury. This could generate hundreds of billions of dollars in one-time revenue for Bitcoin purchases. This gold revaluation effectively unlocks existing asset value without incurring additional debt or raising taxes. 3. The Act also suggests lowering the cap on Federal Reserve surplus, requiring the Fed to annually transfer a portion of its profits for Bitcoin purchases. This utilizes Federal Reserve profits (which ultimately belong to the Treasury) as a funding source. 4. In summary, this plan aims to diversify existing Federal reserves and Treasury funds to finance Bitcoin purchases, rather than increasing overall government spending. This approach, through balance sheet adjustments, minimizes the direct impact on the federal deficit. However, Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent dismissed speculation about revaluing U.S. gold reserves. ● Seized and Confiscated Assets : The U.S. government is already a significant holder of Bitcoin globally, although these holdings primarily result from law enforcement seizures rather than active purchases. Seizures from cases such as Silk Road (a darknet marketplace) and the Bitfinex hack have accumulated over 200,000 BTC. By the end of 2024, the U.S. government reportedly held approximately 198,000 BTC, valued at around $17.6 billion. However, the government typically auctions seized Bitcoin (e.g., through the U.S. Marshals Service). Should Congress permit, these existing or future seized Bitcoins could be directly allocated to the strategic reserve without being sold. Historical U.S. Reserve Strategies Offer Precedents for Bitcoin as a Reserve Asset ● Historically, the U.S. government has considered the strategic use of special asset reserves to strengthen its fiscal or monetary position. The most notable example is its gold reserve. 1. During the Great Depression in the 1930s, the U.S. government enacted the “Gold Reserve Act of 1934”. Through this legislation, it significantly increased its holdings of domestic gold and artificially raised its price from $20.67 to $35 per ounce. This effectively revalued gold, generating a substantial book surplus for the Treasury. 2. This surplus was subsequently used to establish the Exchange Stabilization Fund, among other purposes, aiding the government in navigating financial difficulties. After World War II, under the Bretton Woods system, the U.S. amassed the majority of global official gold reserves, and gold became a foundational element of the U.S. dollar’s credibility. 3. Despite the dollar’s decoupling from gold in 1971, the U.S. Treasury still holds 8,133 tons of gold (approximately 261 million ounces) today. Its nominal value remains around $11 billion (at the legally fixed price), while its market value exceeds $500 billion. 4. This historical context demonstrates the U.S. government’s past willingness to allocate a portion of national wealth to scarce commodities in order to stabilize the financial system. Bitcoin proponents draw a parallel, referring to Bitcoin as “digital gold” and arguing that this historical analogy sets a precedent for government acquisition of Bitcoin—a move mirroring past increases in gold reserves to bolster national assets. ● Moreover, the U.S. government maintains the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) as a mechanism to stabilize energy markets during extraordinary periods. This serves as another example of the government holding commodity reserves for contingency purposes. Legal analysts suggest that using the oil reserve to moderate oil prices or even fund the budget (through oil sales for revenue) could provide a relevant framework for a potential Bitcoin reserve. Stablecoin Legislation: Executive Order Advances Stablecoin Legalization : In January 2025, President Trump signed an executive order with the stated objective of “promoting the development and growth of lawful and legitimate dollar-backed stablecoins worldwide,” framing this as essential for preserving the U.S. dollar’s global dominance. Concurrently, the order prohibits the research and development of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), citing potential threats to individual liberties and market competitiveness. ● Republican Senator Bill Hagerty introduced the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, a bill focused on creating a regulatory framework for stablecoins, including mandated guidelines for issuer qualifications and reserve asset custody. ● Tim Scott, Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, formed a working group and collaborated with AI and crypto ‘czar’ David Sacks to expedite the legislative process. The Trump administration aims to finalize regulatory framework proposals within six months, a timeline experts have called “lightning speed”. ● President Trump called for establishing a crypto advisory council, led by innovation-supportive industry leaders, to shape policy and encourage agencies such as the SEC to revise their regulatory approach to stablecoins. The cryptocurrency summit in March 2025 further consolidated industry feedback and aimed to finalize legislative specifics. Key Impacts: Accelerated Convergence of Traditional Finance and the Cryptocurrency Market: Legalizing stablecoins provides a legitimate pathway for banks and payment processors to participate in the cryptocurrency market, potentially catalyzing the development of more institutional-grade stablecoin offerings. For instance, the Trump administration supports commercial banks in the custody or issuance of stablecoins. Adapting Key Indicators to the Evolving Global Macroeconomic Landscape Macroeconomic Background and Indicators Interest Rate Cut Timing Hinges on Significant Economic Downturn Data Inflation data currently appears to be under control, as evidenced by the January PCE Price Index of 2.6%—the lowest since June 2024, before the previous rate cut. Despite this, the U.S. economy has not yet shown signs of entering a recession. The Federal Reserve currently forecasts two interest rate cuts in 2025, with the PCE inflation rate and non-farm payroll figures being the primary factors influencing these decisions. ● In January, U.S. non-farm payrolls increased by 143,000, and the unemployment rate declined to 4%. This contrasts with the context of the previous interest rate cut, which was widely viewed as politically motivated by Democratic election considerations, despite an above-trend economy and moderate inflation. As a result of that experience, any future rate cuts are now expected to require clear signs of a significant economic downturn, such as negative GDP growth. ● The federal workforce is projected to shrink by approximately 400,000 in 2025 due to ongoing hiring freezes, deferred resignations, and DOGE-related layoffs. These developments suggest a likely downturn in U.S. equity markets—particularly the S&P 500 and Nasdaq—even before any potential rate cuts occur. Given that the cryptocurrency market often acts as a three-times leveraged proxy of the Nasdaq, a substantial correction appears probable, with crypto markets expected to decline earlier and recover sooner than traditional equities. https://en.macromicro.me/collections/4/us-employ-relative/126695/us-number-of-jobs-elon-and-doge-cut-in-2025 ● Current U.S. 10-Year Treasury Yield Declines to 4.19%, Benchmark Interest Rate at 4.5% https://en.macromicro.me/collections/4/us-employ-relative/126695/us-number-of-jobs-elon-and-doge-cut-in-2025 TGA Replenishment Post-Debt Ceiling May Force QT Pause U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bassett has indicated that once the debt ceiling is resolved, the primary strategy will be to increase long-term Treasury issuance while reducing short-term debt. This shift in the maturity structure aims to lock in borrowing at lower long-term rates, easing refinancing pressures and reducing annual interest expenses. Functionally, this approach resembles a form of “fiscal QE,” intended to stabilize the bond market through adjusted issuance strategies. However, its implementation may be gradual. In the near term, it is not expected to significantly increase the supply of long-term Treasuries, but rather to signal a pause in quantitative tightening (QT). As of February 2025, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet had contracted from its pandemic high of approximately $9 trillion to $6.7 trillion. Since June 2024, the maximum monthly reduction in QT was lowered from $95 billion to $60 billion, allocated as $25 billion in Treasury securities and $35 billion in mortgage-backed securities (MBS). However, the actual pace of QT has been slower, averaging around $40 billion per month ($25 billion in Treasuries and $15 billion in MBS), due to factors such as bond maturities and early repayments. If this pace continues, the Fed’s total assets are projected to decline to $6.4 trillion by the end of 2025, with reserves falling to $2.7 trillion, resulting in a reserve-to-GDP ratio of about 8.8%. During the 2019 QT cycle, the Fed’s reserve-to-GDP ratio bottomed at 6.85% in Q3 2019. Currently, the ratio stands much higher at 11.19%, with reserves of $3.33 trillion. Based on the Fed’s projected 2.1% GDP growth in 2025, the reserve balance could fall to around $2.05 trillion—suggesting $1.28 trillion in remaining capacity for reserve reduction and indicating that the Fed has not yet reached its minimum comfortable level. https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_recenttrends.htm Expected End of Quantitative Tightening (QT) : Major Institutions Anticipate QT Will Conclude Primarily in Q2 2025 The main reason for this expectation is the debt ceiling trigger. Once activated, the Treasury must prioritize mandatory payments (such as interest and Social Security), leading to a rapid drawdown of the Treasury General Account (TGA). ● The Federal Reserve’s January 2025 meeting minutes revealed that some FOMC members believed QT should end sometime in 2025. If the Fed begins action in April, halting QT would inject $540 billion in liquidity into the market in 2025, compared to previous forecasts. ● Since February 11, the Treasury’s TGA balance has fallen by $240.6 billion. Ahead of a debt ceiling resolution (potentially delayed until Q3 2025), the TGA could shrink by another $400 billion, nearing historical depletion levels. This would temporarily boost liquidity and raise reserve balances, as illustrated by the short-term increase in bank reserves in the chart below: https://www.investing.com ● Upon reaching a debt ceiling agreement, the Treasury will need to replenish the TGA through significant bond issuance. This will redirect market funds back into the TGA, causing a corresponding contraction in bank reserves. ● If an agreement is reached in Q3, the Treasury may need to withdraw around $700 billion in liquidity. Combined with the Fed’s ongoing QT policy, this could amplify volatility in reserve levels and lead to a temporary pause in QT. https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WDTGAL Tax Cut Policies May Be Implemented in Q4 On February 25, 2025, the U.S. House of Representatives narrowly passed the “Big, Beautiful” Budget Bill by a vote of 217 to 215. Key proposals include: (1) Extending 2017 Tax Relief: The bill would extend the individual and corporate tax cuts from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act—originally set to expire at the end of 2025—through 2035, potentially benefiting around 30 million service workers and low-to-middle-income families. (2) New Tax Breaks: The legislation would eliminate federal taxes on overtime pay, tips, and Social Security benefits. (3) Raising the Federal Debt Limit: The bill proposes increasing the debt ceiling from $36.22 trillion to $40 trillion. (4) Increased Defense and Border Security Spending: An additional $300 billion would be allocated to defense and border security. (5) $2 Trillion in Spending Cuts: Proposed reductions include $880 billion in Medicaid, SNAP, and education spending. The bill still requires Senate review and approval. The most optimistic timeline suggests all legislative processes could conclude by Q3 2025, with implementation beginning on October 1, 2025. Conclusion Despite the absence of a defining innovation narrative akin to DeFi in this cycle, structural shifts in the regulatory landscape are reshaping the crypto startup ecosystem. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has dismissed its lawsuits against major exchanges like Coinbase and repealed the DeFi broker rule. This pivotal shift now allows previously non-compliant innovations—such as the on-chain trading of tokenized U.S. stocks—to become viable. As this more relaxed regulatory environment takes hold, it is likely to foster a new wave of organic, blockchain-native innovation, injecting fresh momentum into the crypto industry.

In its latest note, the bank estimated Binance’s BNB will reach $1,275 by the end of 2025 and a staggering $2,775 in 2028. Geoffrey Kendrick, the bank’s head of crypto research, issued an optimistic prediction that is based on the estimate that the Binance Coin remains an important benchmark for digital assets and has historically maintained a strong correlation with Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ). Between the established correlation and overall strength, Standard Chartered’s forecast can be viewed through the lens of its earlier BTC price prediction. As Finbold reported in late April, the banking giant estimates that the world’s premier cryptocurrency will climb to $200,000 by the end of 2025, and it set its sights for 2028 at $500.000. The ambitious predictions for Bitcoin would see the coin 106.31% from its press time price of $96,942 by December 31 and 415.77% within three years. Under the circumstances, the fact that the BNB forecast estimates a 110.47% rally for the token this year and 358.07% from its press time price of $605 by 2028 falls in line with the correlation thesis. Why BNB is set for a 360% three-year rally Although Standard Chartered’s Kendrick noted that BNB’s developer activity has been comparatively lacking in recent years, he opined that the upcoming Maxwell upgrade and the recent Pascal hard fork would alter the situation. Kendrick also revealed that the token’s low developer activity has been less of a hurdle than it would be for most other digital assets, thanks to its utility in the Binance cryptocurrency exchange ecosystem and use on related decentralized platforms such as PancakeSwap. BNB adoption could skyrocket in 2025 BNB could also potentially receive additional utility and see greater adoption in the relatively near future.

VanEck just filed for a spot BNB ETF pic.twitter.com/yOanuNMyjp — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) May 5, 2025 The SEC is widely expected to approve a significant set of such investment vehicles due to multiple factors, including opening the floodgates with Bitcoin and Ethereum in 2024, growing more crypto-friendly under President Donald Trump , but also due to Trump Media & Technology (NASDAQ: DJT ) partnership with Crypto.com to launch digital asset exchange-traded products (ETP). Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao has also been lobbying for nation states to adopt his company’s cryptocurrency and recommended that Kyrgyzstan include both BTC and BNB in a strategic reserve on May 5.

While it would be unfair to say the cryptocurrency has been weak, though it is 13.66% down year-to-date (YTD), it is 75.59% above the high points of its ‘crypto winter’ range between roughly $200 and $350, it has been somewhat stagnant.

Lawmakers raised concerns over potential conflicts of interest and insider profits, with the TRUMP token seeing major gains after a White House gala announcement. WLFI Plans USD1 Airdrop World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a crypto platform that is backed by members of the Trump family, is preparing to airdrop a small amount of its newly launched USD-pegged stablecoin, USD1, to early WLFI token holders. This initiative is currently undergoing a governance vote, and is intended as both a reward for early supporters and a live test of the platform’s airdrop mechanism. According to the proposal that was published on May 6 in the WLFI governance forum, the main goal of the airdrop is to validate the technical functionality of the system in real-time. With the voting set to close on May 14, the proposal already received overwhelming support, with 99.97% of votes cast in favor. This is equivalent to 2.6 billion tokens. Just 0.03%, or about 901,000 tokens, have voted against it. Vote results and timeline (Source: World Liberty Financial ) WLFI placed a lot of emphasis on just how important this test will be to ensure the readiness of its smart contracts and in introducing users to its USD1 stablecoin. While the exact amount of USD1 to be distributed is still undecided, it will be calculated based on the number of eligible wallets and the platform’s airdrop budget. The date for the airdrop is also pending, and WLFI reserves the right to halt or alter the test airdrop at any time. The platform raised $550 million through two public token sales since its September launch, and attracted a community of 85,000 registered holders. This latest proposal was made at a time of growing global interest in stablecoins, with the market cap of USD-backed tokens like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) reaching $230 billion in April, according to Citigroup . These two stablecoins alone account for 90% of the market. Meanwhile, countries are beginning to challenge US dollar dominance in the stablecoin space. Abu Dhabi recently announced a new dirham-backed stablecoin project, and Russia is exploring a ruble-pegged alternative after sanctions that led to frozen wallets on Garantex and associated USDT accounts. Democrats Target Trump’s Crypto Empire While the crypto community seems impressed with the Trump-backed WLFI’s airdrop plan, not everyone is impressed with the President’s crypto involvement. Democrat lawmakers in the United States launched a coordinated effort to scrutinize and potentially restrict President Donald Trump’s involvement in cryptocurrency ventures. Two new legislative proposals and a subcommittee investigation were launched to cut off his ability to profit from projects like the Trump-branded meme coin and the WLFI platform. On May 6, Senator Chris Murphy introduced the Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement Act (MEME Act), which seeks to bar federal officials and their immediate families from promoting or profiting from digital assets, including meme coins. The bill proposes civil penalties of up to $250,000 and the forfeiture of any profits to the US Treasury, as well as possible criminal consequences including fines and prison sentences of up to five years. Representative Sam Liccardo submitted companion legislation in the House. However, with Republicans controlling both chambers, the proposals face an uphill battle. On the same day, Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal announced a preliminary inquiry by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI) into several Trump-affiliated crypto initiatives, including the Official Trump (TRUMP) token and WLFI. The PSI sent document requests to the firms behind these projects, demanding records of communications with the Trump organization and clarity on steps taken to mitigate potential conflicts of interest. The subcommittee is particularly focused on the surge in TRUMP token value after an April 23 announcement that the top 220 holders will be invited to a gala dinner at the White House. This caused the token to spike almost 50% from $9.40 to $13.65. The TRUMP token launched on Jan. 18 and once peaked at $73.43. TRUMP all-time price action (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Despite the price drop from its all-time high, blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis reports that more than half of TRUMP token holders are in profit. Approximately two million wallets purchased the token, with 54,000 new wallets joining after the dinner announcement. Among them, 58 major investors collectively made over $1.1 billion in profits, each earning more than $10 million. The meme coin’s creator earned $320 million to date, with $1.3 million added since the dinner news. Meanwhile, a new player entered the scene. Trucking logistics company Freight Technologies announced on April 30 that it plans to build a $20 million TRUMP token treasury via a convertible note issuance. The firm’s CEO, Javier Selgas, described the token as a means of diversifying its crypto holdings and supporting fair trade policies. Earlier, on April 1, the company also purchased $5.2 million worth of Fetch.ai's FET token. Lawmakers Also Question MELANIA Meme Coin Meanwhile, a group of crypto traders reportedly made around $100 million in profits by purchasing large amounts of Melania Trump’s meme coin, MELANIA, just minutes before its official launch announcement. According to a May 6 report by the Financial Times, the traders spent approximately $2.6 million to buy 16.7 million of the 200 million total MELANIA tokens slated for sale during the launch period on Jan. 19. MELANIA all-time price action (Source: CoinMarketCap ) The token's price soared from around $2.00 to $12.95 shortly after Melania Trump publicized it on social media, which was a 550% spike. The group allegedly liquidated their positions in the 12 hours of the announcement. In addition, 22 more accounts reportedly bought close to $900,000 worth of MELANIA tokens 42 seconds after the token went live. The MELANIA token was launched just two days after Donald Trump, then president-elect, announced his own TRUMP token, and both have since drawn a lot of scrutiny from lawmakers. Critics argue the projects raise concerns about conflicts of interest, foreign influence, and potential corruption. Although the First Lady appears less central to the backlash, most of the criticism is centered on Donald Trump himself Since their launch, both tokens saw dramatic declines. MELANIA is currently trading at just $0.31, while TRUMP, despite a brief surge after the dinner announcement, fell to $10.90. Even more controversy surrounds the TRUMP token as two companies linked to the president reportedly control around 80% of its supply. Although a large portion of those tokens are locked and set to vest over the next three years, some critics warn that project insiders still have the potential to rug-pull unsuspecting investors.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MINING|REGULATION|TRADING|AIRDROP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-07 09:24:13

The project is currently at phase 4 with a token price of $0.025 while selling more than 443 million tokens due to strong market interest in crypto. The decentralized finance (DeFi) project has become a hot investing destination as SOL and ETH token holders find promise in its structured tokenomics that predicts a 140% profit opportunity when it lists at $0.06. Phase 5 approaches while phase 4 remains more than half completed leading to speculations about a token price increase from $0.025 to $0.03. The strong market interest surrounding Mutuum Finance (MUTM) creates predictions that this project will yield remarkable growth to reach $3 by 2025. But what drives this enthusiasm? Mutuum Finance’s Lending Model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out by providing an innovative lending platform to its users. The platform allows users to put their ETH tokens into the mtToken system that generates passive income through accumulated interest payments. The crypto tokens serve as universal assets that increase liquidity while offering enhanced flexibility to DeFi users. The lending process includes borrowers securing loans through assets that maintain higher value than borrowed amounts for lender protection. The team strengthens trust by initiating a CertiK smart contract audit which will reveal its results on social channels. Securing the network is a core project focus at Mutuum Finance (MUTM) which separates it from traditional volatile crypto markets. The available entry option at $0.025 through phase 4 approaches capacity which accelerates investor urgency to make a quick investment. Tokenomics and Buy Pressure Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) structured development approach creates its fundamental attraction. Investors in phase 4 stock can expect to earn a 20% profit from the phase 5 price change to $0.03 and they will receive at least 140% in profit if the token reaches $0.06 on the market. After the project launch early investors stand to receive a 11,900% ROI due to analysts predicting $3 as the next price point. Through this mechanism the platform distributes profits from its operations to purchase MUTM tokens while distributing rewards to mtToken stakers. The MUTM dashboard presented recently allows top 50 token holders to receive additional tokens when they maintain their position leading to elevated competition within the network. The combination of gamified and powerful tokenomics functions to create lasting demand which turns Mutuum Finance (MUTM) into an attractive choice for experienced crypto investors. Racing Toward a 50x Future Mutuum Finance (MUTM) shows rapid growth through its phases leading to phase 5 as the current phase 4 price of $0.025 continues to decrease.

The S&P 500 index shed 0.77% in Wednesday’s pre-market session, while the global crypto market cap recorded a 1.26% increase in the last 24 hours to cross $3 trillion. According to the Wall Street Journal, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are set to hold discussions with China’s top economic official on Thursday. News of the talks, expected to take place in Zurich, started a rally in stock-index futures overnight, correcting two consecutive days of market declines. Stock futures rebound after consecutive market losses Following the announcement of the US-China planned meeting, S&P 500 futures climbed approximately 0.8%, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose 196 points, or 0.42%. Nasdaq 100 futures advanced by 0.48%. The rebound comes after Tuesday’s regular session saw losses across all major US indexes. The Dow had dropped nearly 400 points, or 0.9%, while the S&P 500 slid by 0.8%. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.9%, pulled lower by a selloff in Palantir shares that saw disappointing earnings. Investor sentiment had already been rattled by macroeconomic concerns and a lack of progress on trade deals. Earlier in the day, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney met with President Donald Trump at the White House. Carney pushed back against provocative comments from the US president asking Canada to be absorbed as the 51st US state, saying his country “isn’t for sale.” On the digital asset side, the altcoin market cap broke out of a prolonged falling wedge pattern, but faces headwinds at the 21-day and 50-day moving averages, acting as resistance levels. #ALTS MARKET CAP ANALYSIS The ALTS market cap has broken out of a falling wedge pattern with strong volume, indicating potential bullish momentum.

The coin is still in a consolidation phase after rallying briefly in late April back up to $90,000. Bitcoin is trading just above the $96,800 resistance zone and has been oscillating in a tight range, but the overall structure remains bullish. It continues to hold the $91,000 support level, well above both its 100-day and 200-day moving averages. No major signs of bearish reversal or a deeper pullback are visible on the daily chart. Corporate America struggles with trade uncertainty Several US companies are reportedly still assessing the “damage” done by tariffs and geopolitical uncertainty, and look more likely to revise their forecasts for the fiscal year 2025. Automaker Ford projected that tariffs could reduce one of its core profit measures by as much as $1.5 billion. Ford shares surprisingly rose 2.7% before markets opened on Wednesday. Toy giant Mattel saw a 2.8% gain after revealing plans to raise prices and shift production out of China to counter an expected $270 million tariff burden. US Fed meeting in focus Meanwhile, attention is turning to the Federal Reserve, whose two-day policy meeting began Tuesday. The central bank is expected to hold interest rates steady, but markets are awaiting Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference for any insight into the Fed’s stance on inflation and economic risks stemming from the trade conflict.

Keeping an eye on the pulse of the US spot Bitcoin ETF market is crucial for understanding broader sentiment. After a brief period of positive momentum, the market saw a notable shift on May 6th. Understanding the Recent Bitcoin ETF Outflows Following three consecutive trading days of net inflows, the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF landscape experienced a reversal on May 6th, recording a combined net outflow of $86.21 million. This data, shared by market observer Trader T on X, indicates a change in investor behavior during this specific trading session. Let’s break down where these movements occurred: Grayscale’s GBTC: Continued to see significant exits, leading the pack with $89.92 million in net outflows. ARK Invest’s ARKB: Reported net outflows totaling $16.12 million. Franklin Templeton’s EZBC: Saw net outflows amounting to $8.26 million. VanEck’s HODL: Also registered net outflows, coming in at $8.07 million. These outflows collectively outweighed the inflows seen elsewhere in the market. Where Did the Money Go? Analyzing IBIT Inflows Despite the overall net outflow day, not all funds experienced withdrawals. BlackRock’s IBIT, one of the largest and most popular spot Bitcoin ETFs, continued to attract capital, recording a net inflow of $36.16 million. This highlights continued demand for BlackRock’s offering even as other funds saw redemptions. The remaining spot Bitcoin ETFs tracked in the report showed no change in their holdings for the day. What Do These Movements Mean for the Crypto Market Trends ? While a single day of outflows doesn’t necessarily signal a major trend reversal, it’s a data point worth noting. After several days of positive flows, which can often correlate with positive price action or sentiment for Bitcoin, a day of net outflows suggests some investors took profits or adjusted positions. The persistent GBTC outflows remain a factor influencing the overall market dynamics of these funds, often offsetting inflows into products like IBIT. Monitoring these daily flow figures provides insight into the institutional and retail demand for direct Bitcoin exposure via these regulated investment vehicles. They act as a proxy for sentiment and capital allocation within the digital asset space. Summary: A Closer Look at Spot Bitcoin ETF Flows May 6th marked a pause in the recent trend of positive net inflows for US spot Bitcoin ETFs, with the market experiencing $86.21 million in total net outflows. This shift was primarily driven by significant outflows from GBTC, alongside smaller outflows from ARKB, EZBC, and HODL, despite continued positive flows into IBIT. Keeping track of these flows is essential for understanding the evolving dynamics of the US spot Bitcoin ETF market and its potential impact on broader Crypto market trends .

Rumors started circulating on May 4 that Zerebro ( ZEREBRO ) co-founder Jeffy Yu had committed a suicide during a livestream on the memecoin launch platform Pump.fun . A video that appeared to show Yu smoking a cigarette and then shooting himself in the neck spread rapidly on crypto X. While some were skeptical, many believed it to be genuine — especially after Yu’s obituary was published two days later on the memorial platform Legacy. However, mounting evidence now suggests the reports of his death may have been fabricated. First, the Legacy obituary is no longer available. More tellingly, on-chain data shows that multiple transactions tied to Yu’s wallet were executed after his alleged death. According to Lookonchain , a wallet likely tied to Yu sold 35.55 million ZEREBRO tokens for 8,572 SOL (approximately $1.27 million), and subsequently transferred 7,100 SOL (around $1.06 million) to the development wallet of LLJEFFY, a coin Yu launched on the day of his alleged suicide. Blockchain analytics firm Bubblemaps also reported that the LLJEFFY deployer and associated wallets were actively trading and burning tokens after Yu’ alleged death. One wallet, 5Ko12, alone sold over $170,000 worth of ZEREBRO across multiple transactions. Source: @bubblemaps You might also like: Zerebro founder Jeffy Yu reportedly suicides on livestream, after launching a ‘legacoin’ In addition to on-chain signs, an unverified letter allegedly written by Jeffy Yu to investors is currently circulating on X. In that letter, Yu says he staged the suicide video as a deliberate act to exit the crypto space, stating: “I created a video in which I depict myself shooting myself. My decision to create and indirectly disseminate this video was deliberate. In my perspective, this was my only viable exit from persistent harassment, blackmail, and threats.” He also explains that leaving publicly without triggering further backlash and doxxing was impossible: “Had I stepped away openly, I would have tanked the price of ZEREBRO and OPAIUM projects when my departure became imminent. This would have resulted in even more intense targeting, which was previously evidenced when out token price >90% in January, causing a massive increase in resentment towards me as a developer.” Source: @beaniemaxi Meanwhile, ZEREBRO and OPAIUM tokens have both tanked 20% in the past 24 hours, while the new coin LLJEFFY is up over 100% over the same period and 24% in the past hour alone.

At the time of writing, BTC is changing hands at $96,500, posting a modest 3% gain over the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. Bitfinex, in its latest markets report , called the $95,000 zone a “critical pivot” for Bitcoin, noting it forms the lower boundary of a price range that held from November 2024 through February 2025. A sustained move above it could signal a structural return to bullish conditions and set the stage for a retest of the $109,000 all-time high, achieved in January just before President Trump’s inauguration. But the optimism is tempered. “Failure to hold above $95K could flip the zone into resistance,” Bitfinex warned, opening the door to another leg of corrective downside. The next few trading sessions are likely to be pivotal, as the market decides whether to charge toward new highs or retreat to lower support levels. $98K Could Trigger Bitcoin Short Liquidations As Bitcoin flirts with $97,000, the short sellers are sweating. Crypto analyst Thomas Fahrer flagged $98,000 as the pressure point where nearly $400 million in short positions risk being wiped out. “Send it,” he posted on X, hinting at a possible squeeze that could rapidly accelerate price action. The mood among analysts is cautiously bullish. Back in March, Real Vision’s Jamie Coutts projected a potential top of $123,000 by June under favorable conditions. Swan Bitcoin CEO Cory Klippsten offered a 50% chance for new all-time highs before the month closes. With BTC now inching toward six figures, those projections are being revisited with fresh conviction. Rate Decision Looms, Sentiment Tilts Greedy Adding to the uncertainty is today’s Federal Reserve interest rate decision, a potential volatility trigger that markets will be watching closely. While the CME FedWatch Tool suggests slim odds of a rate cut, even a neutral tone could embolden crypto bulls further. Meanwhile, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index jumped 8 points to 67 in the past 24 hours—firmly in “Greed” territory. Sentiment is rising, and all eyes are on whether Bitcoin can finally crack the $100,000 psychological barrier.

Market experts predict that both altcoins will deliver powerful profit growth through 2025. DOGE indicates substantial price potential through technical indicators yet Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gives investors a lending option that drives market demand. These crypto projects are distinctive in the investment landscape because they present attractive yield opportunities to potential investors. Here’s an analysis with an assessment of DOGE since its price rose from $0.129 in April and the future potential of Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Dogecoin’s bullish surge Dogecoin continues to strengthen as it jumps 38% higher than its April minimum value of $0.129. DOGE demonstrates positive technical signals because it maintains a position above the $0.138 0.382 Fibonacci support level. The previous resistance zone transformed into an entry position which users can use to advance their performance. The market analysts predict an astounding 2,087% price increase for Dogecoin to reach $3.94 through incoming Federal Reserve decisions to reduce interest rates. The performance of Bitcoin restricts the enhancement potential of DOGE. A Bitcoin dominance peak may lead to DOGE price growth yet the currency remains prone to unstable market movements. MUTM provides a new assurance driven from practical applications. Mutuum Finance’s presale frenzy Mutuum Finance (MUTM) currently attracts significant interest during its phase 4 presale as investors have already purchased 60% of the tokens that costs $0.025 with a promised phase 5 price increase. Investors show intense interest because the upcoming phase 5 price hike to $0.03 will give current buyers a 20% return on their investment. The MUTM project has earned $7.7 million through 9,500 members who have acquired 444 million tokens in its fundraising campaign. Following the release of a new dashboard system Mutuum Finance offers bonus tokens to the top 50 holders who succeed in keeping their positions. Increased urgency takes hold because phase 4 is set to complete its distribution quickly. The project contains structured tokenomics that indicate a 140% return on investment when tokens list at $0.06 yet some analysts predict the price might escalate to $2 post-launch which would represent a 7,900% ROI. A rising market sentiment creates the foundation for its future success as a DeFi model. Mutuum Finance’s DeFi edge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) enters the market through its development of a lending and borrowing platform which appeals to a specific sector. The platform provides passive earnings to its users through safe loans with more assets than needed. Revenue from the buy-and-distribute system allows Mutuum Finance to repurchase MUTM tokens which creates demand rises while giving staking rewards to users. CertiK will complete an audit of Mutuum Finance smart contracts that will be released to social users in the near future. The emphasis on safety enables better trust from investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) delivers practical utility through its structured lending and borrowing platform which offers a steady investment option for long-term growth even though Dogecoin has shown speculative market fluctuations. Seizing altcoin potential Dogecoin has achieved technical breakout and Mutuum Finance is delivering its DeFi invention to create new enthusiasm across the cryptocurrency domain. The 20x price rally potential of DOGE depends on market-wide catalysts but MUTM produces structured profit by combining presale activities with lending operations. The near expiration of Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) phase 4 presale joined with potential DOGE momentum provides investors an opportunity to secure substantial returns for 2025. Research both projects thoroughly and consider their unique strengths before diving in.

On X, Ayotte proclaimed, ‘New Hampshire is once again First in the Nation! Just signed a new law allowing our state to invest in cryptocurrency and precious metals.’ This move positions New Hampshire as a progressive state in the digital asset space. Legal expert Fred Rispoli, well-known within the XRP and crypto communities, took to X to share his insights on the potential implications of this new law for XRP. Rispoli stated, ‘According to this law that was passed, if $XRP hits a $500B market cap this year, then it is also eligible for the NH digital asset strategic reserve in 2026!’ His post has garnered widespread attention, fueling discussions about XRP’s future. According to this law that was passed, if $XRP hits a $500B market cap this year then it is also eligible for the NH digital asset strategic reserve in 2026! https://t.co/urYEFb0K6Q — Fred Rispoli (@freddyriz) May 7, 2025 New Hampshire’s Strategic Move into Digital Assets New Hampshire’s decision to permit state investments in cryptocurrency and precious metals marks a bold step towards embracing digital finance. This legal structure may position the state as a leader in blockchain innovation, attracting investment from institutions and individuals. New Hampshire’s decision to include cryptocurrency in its investment portfolio could pave the way for other states. It signifies growing governmental acceptance of digital assets, highlighting the shift towards integrating cryptocurrencies into more traditional financial frameworks. XRP’s Market Cap Milestone: A Gateway to the Reserve Fred Rispoli’s statement sheds light on a specific clause within the new law. Should XRP achieve a $500 billion market cap within the year, it would meet the criteria for inclusion in New Hampshire’s digital asset strategic reserve by 2026. This revelation has invigorated the XRP community, implying that substantial growth in XRP’s market value could align with long-term state investment strategies. Rispoli’s perspective emphasizes the importance of the current market trajectory and XRP’s potential to break into new valuation territory. While XRP’s market cap is much lower, ongoing developments in Ripple and the crypto market could propel it toward this target. Why This Matters for Ripple and XRP Classifying XRP as a strategic reserve asset would be a groundbreaking win for Ripple. Not only would it reinforce XRP’s utility and legitimacy, but it would also establish it as a significant player within state financial mechanisms. This development could encourage other states to consider similar measures, further integrating XRP into mainstream finance. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Moreover, a successful push towards this market cap could attract greater institutional participation, solidifying XRP’s position as a valuable digital asset. It could also alleviate some regulatory uncertainty that has historically hindered Ripple’s expansion within the United States. Community Reactions and Future Implications The response from the XRP community has been overwhelmingly positive, with many expressing excitement over the possibility of state-backed XRP adoption. Though reaching a $500 billion market cap is uncertain, the idea has reignited excitement. Should New Hampshire’s strategic reserve eventually include XRP, it would signal a paradigm shift in how government entities perceive digital assets. As the crypto space evolves, developments like this could shape the future of blockchain adoption at the state level. Fred Rispoli’s insight into the new law underscores the potential impact of New Hampshire’s progressive stance on cryptocurrencies. With a projected market cap, XRP could be a key component of the state’s digital asset reserve plan by 2026. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, developments like this will undoubtedly shape the trajectory of digital finance in the United States.

Optimism has returned to the broader crypto market as investors anticipate diplomatic talks between US and Chinese officials this weekend aimed at easing trade tensions. The global cryptocurrency market capitalization has climbed to $3 trillion, up 2.48% over the last 24 hours. Trading activity has also picked up, with total market volume rising to $83.3 billion, a 30.16% increase. However, caution persists ahead of the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision due later today, which could inject volatility into risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Amid the rebound, market sentiment is diverging for two coins. Concerns continue to mount over Cardano’s trajectory, while PepeX is seeing a rise in investor interest, buoyed by growing community momentum. Cardano may see a fall Cardano (ADA) faces downside risk as Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade goes live on May 7, with historical trends suggesting that major improvements to the Ethereum network often coincide with pressure on ADA. Despite this, Cardano was trading 2% higher intraday at press time. The long-standing competition between Cardano and Ethereum, both among the earliest layer-one blockchains, has frequently seen ADA underperform during key Ethereum upgrades aimed at enhancing scalability and usability. Cardano saw sharp declines following Ethereum’s London upgrade in 2021, the Merge in 2022, and the Dencun upgrade last year, which was followed by a 65% drop. If the pattern repeats, ADA may face a significant decline, especially if it breaks below key support levels. A drop to around $0.66 could trigger long liquidations totaling over $5.4 million, potentially accelerating selling pressure. Analyst Kamil commented that “ADA traders are playing with fire,” citing the high leverage in the market that could amplify volatility.

In a segment largely driven by hype and speculative surges, the absence of structural safeguards has left investors vulnerable. Launchpads such as Pump.fun have faced growing criticism for enabling rapid rollouts of poorly conceived tokens with minimal oversight or accountability. PepeX is positioning itself as a professional-grade alternative, retaining the speculative appeal of meme coins while embedding operational discipline. The platform allocates 95% of each token’s supply to the community, reserving just 5% for project founders. If a token fails to gain traction, its locked liquidity is redistributed to participants, introducing a rare mechanism of accountability in an otherwise opaque landscape. The platform is also leveraging artificial intelligence to modernize meme coin marketing. Its proprietary tool, AKIRA, integrates with Telegram and X (formerly Twitter) accounts to autonomously execute community growth strategies. This removes the need for dedicated marketing teams and enables immediate scalability from launch. By combining investor protection, automated marketing, and community-first tokenomics, PepeX is aiming to legitimize a historically volatile segment of the crypto market. Its presale has raised over $2 million to date, signaling strong investor interest in a launchpad focused on transparency and builder credibility.

44273011,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157987,1746610838,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,South Korea Faces Alarming Capital Outflows Driven by Stablecoins,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/south-korea-stablecoin-outflows/,"South Korea is currently grappling with a significant financial challenge: increasing capital outflows South Korea driven primarily by the rising popularity and attractive yields offered by stablecoins on offshore cryptocurrency exchanges. This trend is not just an economic statistic; it’s a real concern for the nation’s financial stability and the future of its currency, the won. What’s Driving Capital Outflows South Korea? The core issue stems from the differential in investment returns. Traditional banking products in South Korea offer relatively modest interest rates. In contrast, many offshore crypto exchanges South Korea provide staking or lending products for stablecoins (cryptocurrencies pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar) that boast significantly higher yields. For investors seeking better returns, moving capital into these stablecoin products becomes an attractive option. Consider the simple economics: Local Banks: Low single-digit interest rates on deposits. Offshore Stablecoin Products: Potentially much higher yields, sometimes ranging from mid to high single digits, or even higher depending on the platform and specific product. This yield gap incentivizes individuals and potentially institutions to convert their South Korean won into stablecoins like USDT or USDC and transfer them to platforms outside the country to earn these higher returns. This movement of funds constitutes a capital outflow. Understanding Stablecoin Risks South Korea Faces The implications of this trend are far-reaching. A recent paper from Hashed Open Research (HOR) highlighted the specific dangers posed by U.S. dollar-pegged South Korea stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) to the nation’s financial ecosystem. The report paints a concerning picture of potential instability. Key risks identified by HOR include: Weakening of the Won: As more capital leaves the country to chase stablecoin yields, demand for the won decreases relative to the demand for stablecoins (and ultimately, the USD they are pegged to). This can put downward pressure on the won’s exchange rate. Loss of Monetary Control: The South Korean central bank has tools to manage the money supply and influence interest rates for the won. However, these tools have limited effect on capital held and traded in offshore stablecoins. A significant shift of economic activity into stablecoins could erode the central bank’s ability to manage its own currency effectively. Blurring the Lines Between Economies: Continued large-scale capital outflows could increasingly integrate the South Korean economy with the offshore crypto economy, making it harder to distinguish between traditional financial activities and crypto-based ones. This lack of clear separation can create regulatory challenges and systemic risks. Systemic Risk: While stablecoins aim for stability, they are not without risk. Issues with reserves, regulatory crackdowns, or platform failures on offshore exchanges could have ripple effects, potentially impacting South Korean investors and, if the scale is large enough, the broader financial system. The HOR paper serves as a stark warning that ignoring the growing influence of South Korea stablecoins and the resulting outflows could have tangible negative consequences for the country’s economic sovereignty and stability. South Korea’s Potential Response: A National CBDC? Recognizing these pressing challenges, South Korea is reportedly exploring countermeasures. One significant consideration is the potential launch of its own state-backed digital currency, often referred to as a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). A South Korea CBDC could serve multiple purposes in addressing the stablecoin challenge: Offering a Domestic Digital Alternative: A won-pegged CBDC could provide a digital form of the national currency that is as convenient and potentially as innovative as stablecoins, but remains within the domestic financial system and under the central bank’s control. Competing on Features: While a CBDC might not directly offer the high yields seen on offshore platforms (as it would likely be a liability of the central bank, similar to physical cash), it could offer other benefits like instant settlement, reduced transaction costs, and programmable features that could make it attractive for various use cases, potentially reducing the reliance on foreign stablecoins for domestic transactions or innovations. Strengthening Financial Sovereignty: By providing a robust, digital form of the won, a CBDC could help reinforce the won’s usability in the digital age and counter the encroachment of foreign-pegged digital currencies into the domestic economy. Improving Data and Oversight: A CBDC could offer the central bank greater visibility into digital transaction flows within the economy, providing better data for monetary policy decisions and potentially aiding in combating illicit finance. The consideration of a South Korea CBDC signals that the government and financial authorities are taking the threat of capital outflows and the growing influence of stablecoins seriously. It’s a complex undertaking, involving significant technological, regulatory, and societal considerations, but it represents a proactive step towards maintaining control over the nation’s financial future in a rapidly evolving digital landscape. The Role of Offshore Crypto Exchanges South Korea Investors Use It’s important to note that the issue isn’t necessarily the stablecoins themselves, but the platforms and products offering high yields outside of South Korea’s regulatory purview. Offshore crypto exchanges South Korea residents can access provide the infrastructure where these yield-generating activities occur. While offering potential benefits to individual investors through higher returns, their operation outside of domestic regulation creates a blind spot for South Korean authorities regarding capital flows and associated risks. This situation highlights a global challenge for regulators: how to manage the interaction between domestically regulated financial systems and the largely unregulated, borderless world of decentralized finance and offshore crypto platforms. The yield differential is a powerful incentive that regulation alone within a single country struggles to contain. Conclusion: Navigating the Digital Tide South Korea finds itself at a critical juncture, where the allure of high yields on South Korea stablecoins held on offshore crypto exchanges South Korea can access is leading to concerning capital outflows South Korea needs to address. The stablecoin risks South Korea faces, as highlighted by research, are not theoretical; they pose a tangible threat to the won’s stability and the nation’s financial autonomy. The exploration of a South Korea CBDC represents a strategic move to adapt to this new reality, aiming to offer a domestic digital alternative that can compete for usability and relevance in the digital economy. The outcome of this challenge will likely influence how other nations approach the intersection of traditional finance, stablecoins, and the broader crypto market. The situation in South Korea serves as a compelling case study for regulators and policymakers worldwide, demonstrating the complex interplay between technological innovation, economic incentives, and the imperative of maintaining national financial stability in the digital age.

Technical indicators are mixed: The RSI is near 46, and the MACD has issued a bearish crossover, underscoring indecision below $0.75. Whale Accumulation Signals Confidence Whales added some 410 million ADA in April, per a post by analyst Ali Martinez on X (formerly Twitter). On‑chain snapshots confirm this increase: addresses holding 10M–100M ADA increased their stake by about 420 million ADA, valuing the buy at roughly $289 million. Source: Ali Martinez Smaller “whale” wallets (1 M–10 M ADA) also increased, from 2,405 to 2,408 addresses. This level of accumulation suggests large investors view current prices as attractive entry points, which is historically a precursor to strong price moves. ADA trades at $0.68, with a $24 billion market cap and 0.96% dominance in the crypto market. It’s consolidating between $0.66 (support) and $0.75 (resistance). The 200‑day SMA sits near $0.77—an important barrier for bulls . With volume, a break above $0.75 could clear the path to $0.80 and set sights on $1.00. On the downside, a drop below $0.66 risks a deeper retracement to $0.60 or $0.54, in line with recent channel lows . Daily RSI hovers around 46, while the MACD shows a bearish crossover, indicating short‑term momentum favors bears. Cardano’s network remains active despite a cooling on‑chain usage. Daily active addresses declined from 50,000 in late April to 42,000 by May ­­1, reflecting softer retail engagement. Yet DeFi’s total value locked on Cardano stands at $331 million, which is up 6.7% weekly, driven by new staking and smart‑contract deployments. The Lace wallet’s Bitcoin support launch and rising developer activity bolster long‑term fundamentals. Is $1 ADA Price Within Reach? Short term, ADA may trade sideways between $0.66 and $0.75. A decisive break above $0.75 could trigger a rally to $0.80 and potentially $1.00 if market conditions remain bullish and whale demand persists. Source: X Conversely, failure at resistance could see a pullback toward $0.60 or lower. Traders should closely watch whale wallets, volume trends, and the $0.75–$0.77 zone. With large holders accumulating heavily, Cardano has the fuel for a breakout—but only if it clears critical technical barriers.",Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano,EN,0,0,ADA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-07 09:49:30
44273251,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157989,1746611441,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Lista DAO Seals Crucial Partnership with World Liberty Financial,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/lista-dao-partnership-announcement/,"In a move set to ripple through the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape, Lista DAO , the issuer behind the overcollateralized stablecoin lisUSD, has officially announced a strategic partnership with World Liberty Financial (WLFI) . This collaboration brings together two notable entities in the crypto space, promising new opportunities and integrations for users. What is the Core of the Lista DAO and World Liberty Financial Alliance? The foundation of this exciting new alliance was revealed via Lista DAO’s official communication channels. The core of the partnership centers around the integration of WLFI’s fully backed stablecoin, USD1, into the Lista DAO ecosystem. World Liberty Financial, for context, is a crypto project that has garnered attention due to its association with the Trump family, adding a unique dimension to this collaboration within the broader crypto narrative. This strategic alignment isn’t just a handshake; it involves tangible product integrations designed to enhance the utility and reach of both platforms. The immediate result of this partnership is the live availability of WLFI’s USD1 stablecoin within a vault on the Lista DAO platform. This allows Lista DAO users to interact directly with the USD1 asset. Exploring the Benefits of the lisUSD Stablecoin Integration Lista DAO is well-known for its lisUSD stablecoin , a decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin designed to maintain a stable value relative to the US dollar. The integration of another stablecoin, USD1, into the Lista DAO ecosystem offers several potential benefits: Increased Stablecoin Diversity: Users on Lista DAO now have access to an additional stablecoin option, potentially offering more flexibility depending on their needs and trust assumptions regarding different stablecoin issuers. Enhanced Liquidity Prospects: The planned launch of a USD1/lisUSD liquidity pool is a significant development. Liquidity pools are crucial for efficient trading and swapping between assets. A robust pool between these two stablecoins would facilitate seamless exchanges, benefiting users of both assets. Expanded Collateral Options: Perhaps one of the most impactful aspects for DeFi users is the intention to add USD1 as eligible collateral within Lista DAO’s collateralized debt position (CDP) system. This means users could potentially deposit USD1 to borrow lisUSD, expanding the ways users can leverage their assets within the Lista DAO protocol. The partnership leverages the strengths of both platforms: Lista DAO’s established CDP and stablecoin infrastructure and WLFI’s USD1 stablecoin and growing community. Such integrations are vital for the continued growth and interconnectedness of the DeFi space. What Does This Crypto Partnership Mean for the Ecosystem? Every crypto partnership , especially one involving established protocols and newer, high-profile projects, sends signals to the market. This collaboration between Lista DAO and World Liberty Financial highlights a few key trends: Interoperability is Key: DeFi protocols are increasingly looking to integrate with other assets and platforms to offer more value to their users. Stablecoins, being fundamental building blocks of DeFi, are often central to these integrations. Stablecoin Competition and Collaboration: While stablecoins compete for market share, partnerships like this show that collaboration is also possible, creating synergies that benefit users through increased utility and liquidity. Growing Influence of Politically-Linked Projects: The association of WLFI with the Trump family brings a layer of political relevance to the crypto space, indicating that projects with such ties are actively seeking integration within the existing DeFi infrastructure. This could potentially onboard new demographics into DeFi. The partnership’s success will likely depend on the smooth technical implementation of the liquidity pool and CDP integrations, as well as the market’s reception to the USD1/lisUSD pairing and USD1 as collateral. How Will This Impact Users on Lista DAO? For existing users of Lista DAO, this partnership directly translates to more options and potential avenues for yield or leverage. The availability of the USD1 vault is an immediate benefit, offering a place to hold or potentially utilize USD1 within the Lista ecosystem. Looking ahead, the USD1/lisUSD liquidity pool will create opportunities for liquidity providers to earn fees, and the inclusion of USD1 as CDP collateral will provide an alternative asset users can lock up to mint lisUSD. New users interested in World Liberty Financial’s USD1 stablecoin might now be incentivized to explore the Lista DAO platform to utilize their USD1 in DeFi applications, thereby expanding Lista DAO’s user base. This cross-pollination is a common goal of strategic partnerships in the crypto space. Looking Ahead: The Future of USD1 and lisUSD in DeFi The integration of USD1 into Lista DAO is a significant step for both projects. For World Liberty Financial, it provides a direct link into a well-established DeFi protocol, increasing the utility and visibility of their stablecoin. For Lista DAO, it diversifies the assets available on its platform and potentially attracts a new segment of users interested in USD1. The successful launch and adoption of the USD1/lisUSD liquidity pool and the use of USD1 as collateral will be key metrics to watch. These integrations will truly solidify USD1’s place within the Lista DAO ecosystem and provide a real-world use case for the WLFI stablecoin within decentralized finance. This collaboration underscores the dynamic nature of the DeFi market, where protocols constantly seek innovative ways to expand their offerings and build bridges between different assets and communities. The Lista DAO and World Liberty Financial partnership is a prime example of this ongoing evolution. Summary: A Strategic Step Forward for Lista DAO and WLFI In conclusion, the strategic partnership between Lista DAO and World Liberty Financial marks an important development for both entities and the broader DeFi space. By integrating WLFI’s USD1 stablecoin into the Lista DAO platform through vaults, upcoming liquidity pools, and future collateral options, the collaboration aims to enhance stablecoin utility, increase liquidity, and expand user options. This move not only strengthens Lista DAO’s position as a key player in the stablecoin and CDP market but also provides World Liberty Financial’s USD1 with significant exposure within a reputable DeFi protocol. As the planned integrations roll out, the market will be watching closely to see the full impact of this intriguing alliance.

In a recent X post on May 7, the former Binance CEO proposed lowering gas fees on the BSC Chain to his followers. According to data from Y Charts, BSC Chain’s average gas price sits at 2.163 Gwei, down 3.91% from yesterday’s average which was at 2.251 Gwei. Compared to last year, BSC Chain’s gas fee has gone down 41.40% from 3.691 Gwei. BSC Chain gas fees | Source: Y Charts In the context of BSC Chain, Gwei is a unit of BNB ( BNB ) used to measure gas fees, similar to how it’s used on Ethereum ( ETH ). It’s essentially a standardized unit used to measure the cost of processing transactions on the network. One Gwei is equal to around 0.000000001 BNB. “Let’s reduce BSC gas fees? by 3x, 10x?” wrote Zhao on his official account. His prompt was met with mixed reception, as some traders on X urged the current head of YZi Labs to waive gas fees entirely. In response, the Binance founder said that deploying zero gas fees would be out of the question, considering the network would still need to support validators and builders. “Lots of spam, and also need to consider validators and builders,” said Zhao.

According to Dune analytics, BSC Chain has one of the lowest gas fees among Layer 1 networks. In the past seven days, BSC Chain has accumulated an average gas fee of $0.093 and a median gas fee of $0.034. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s average gas fee stands at $0.34 and its median gas fee is currently at $0.088. Avalanche’s ( AVAX ) average gas fee is reportedly lower than both BSC Chain and Ethereum, as it stands at $0.022. Avalanche’s median gas fee is measured at $0.002. Based on Dune’s data, Solana ( SOL ) and Polygon ( POL ) boast the lowest gas fees compared to other Layer 1s, with Polygon’s average gas fee measured at $0.003 and its median gas fee at $0.001. Solana shares the same median gas fee rate as Polygon, with an average gas fee recorded at $0.019.

Many believe it marks Ethereum’s most user-focused transformation yet. Notably, the official Ethereum X account highlighted this development, writing on May 6 that, “ETH Pectra upgrade drops tomorrow – and it’s a big deal.” The thread highlighted key improvements, including smarter wallets, gas-free options, bigger validator limits, and major enhancements in scaling, usability, and developer tooling. Notably , Pectra combines two upgrades, Prague and Electra, and is being hailed as the biggest Ethereum overhaul since The Merge. However, unlike Merge, which redefined Ethereum’s underlying protocol, Pectra is built with users in mind. “The Merge was for the protocol. Pectra is for the people,” Monolith.vc, an Ethereum community, noted. That said, Pectra is expected to introduce account abstraction , giving wallets far more functionality, including batch transactions, gas payments in any token, and the removal of constant approval pop-ups. Additionally, the validator staking limit will rise from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH, streamlining large-scale staking for ETF issuers and institutional players. Upgrades like Verkle Trees and PeerDAS will improve Ethereum’s performance and scalability. Layer 2s also get a boost, with blob capacity doubling from 3 to 6, lowering congestion and gas fees. As per the Ethereum account, these changes will be technical and practical. “Pectra doesn’t just make Ethereum bigger. It makes it smarter, cheaper, and more mainstream-ready,” the account wrote. Meanwhile, investor sentiment continues to be bullish, reflecting this shift. According to CryptoQuant analyst OroCrypto, Ethereum holders have accumulated over 3.5 million ETH in under two months, a staggering 22.5% rise, highlighting their conviction in the network ahead of the upgrade. “This behavior reflects structural belief in Ethereum’s long-term potential,” Oro noted . Elsewhere, crypto trader Merlijn, founder of Profitz Academy, predicted a surge for ETH to $10,000 in the near future, telling his 386,000 followers not to blink as “this could move fast.” “The ETH launch sequence has started. $1,500 was the liftoff pad. $10,000 is the destination,” he noted . His bullish call is based on technical levels showing $2,200 and $4,000 as key resistance points before Ethereum shoots higher. However, some analysts urge caution. Monolith.vc noted that Pectra doesn’t directly affect ETH supply like the Merge did, so a short-term price spike isn’t guaranteed. However, if institutions move quickly to take advantage of the new staking flexibility, ETH demand could quietly increase in the coming months. At press time, ETH was trading at $1,843, reflecting a 2.74% surge in the past 24 hours.",Ethereum|News|Ethereum News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-07 09:55:05

Here’s why",https://timestabloid.com/expert-urges-xrp-holders-to-prepare-for-10-15-and-30-heres-why/,"Crypto commentator All Things XRP has published a detailed simulation via social media, urging XRP holders to begin thinking seriously about their exit strategy in anticipation of a potential price surge. The message focuses not on speculative price predictions but on the emotional and financial consequences of entering a bull run unprepared. The commentator cautions that if XRP were to climb to figures such as $10, $15, or even $30, many investors could find themselves overwhelmed and directionless. According to the post, the most common consequences of not having a clear plan are either panic selling or missing out on profits altogether. The simulation does not aim to offer financial advice, but to provide a model that helps investors think through their options well in advance of market volatility. The commentator emphasizes that “a moonshot isn’t the time to wing it,” highlighting how heightened emotions and sudden volatility can easily derail rational decision-making. IF XRP STARTS FLYING TOWARD $10, $15… EVEN $30—MOST HOLDERS WILL HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO DO. No plan = missed profits or panic selling. Here’s one example of a staged exit strategy to help you start thinking. pic.twitter.com/vQ7ytMEFPv — All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) May 4, 2025 Outlining a Sample Strategy Based on price points, the simulation breaks down a hypothetical exit plan into four stages. It uses a starting investment of $10,000 at an entry price of $2.20 per XRP, which results in a holding of approximately 4,545 XRP. Each stage reflects a price increase, suggesting a different portion of the total holdings to be sold off in response to the rise. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 At the first stage, when XRP reaches between $3.50 and $4.00, the plan proposes selling 20% of holdings. This is based on the expectation of 60% to 80% returns from the $2.20 entry point and historical resistance around that price. The rationale for this stage is to secure early gains while reducing exposure to downside risk, potentially by converting to stablecoins. The second stage, at $5.00 to $6.00, recommends selling 25% of holdings, aligning with what the commentator identifies as realistic bullish targets for 2025. This stage reflects a gain of 127% to 173%. The suggested action at this level includes reallocating capital to other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, or waiting for more favorable re-entry levels. Stage three—targeting a price between $10.00 and $12.00—focuses on locking in what the commentator describes as significant gains. At this level, 30% of holdings would be sold, translating to a return of 350% to 440%. Due to the expected market volatility at such levels, the plan recommends preserving capital and avoiding greed. The final stage, labeled as speculative, proposes selling the remaining 15% to 20% of XRP holdings if the price exceeds $20. This range is characterized as “moonshot territory.” The suggestion is to convert profits into fiat, physical assets, or long-term holdings. Timing exits at this level is acknowledged to be particularly challenging. Visualizing Potential Outcomes The post concludes by showing what such a staged strategy could look like in dollar terms. If executed according to the simulation, the hypothetical investor would realize approximately $38,500 in profits while still holding 10% of the original XRP, which could be worth an additional $9,000 to $13,000 depending on future price action. Importantly, the commentator reinforces that this is merely one possible model. Other investors might exit entirely by $6, hold most of their position until XRP reaches $30 , or scale out small amounts during every major price surge. The central message is that everyone must define their approach based on personal financial goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

44273560,https://coinpaper.com/8964/cz-and-standard-chartered-see-bright-future-for-bitcoin-and-bnb,1746612000,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png,CZ and Standard Chartered See Bright Future for Bitcoin and BNB,https://coinpaper.com/8964/cz-and-standard-chartered-see-bright-future-for-bitcoin-and-bnb,"Two influential voices in the cryptocurrency space—Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao and global asset manager Standard Chartered—have issued bullish long-term projections for leading digital assets Bitcoin and BNB. CZ believes Bitcoin could rise to $1 million during the current market cycle, supported by increasing institutional adoption through spot ETFs and sovereign accumulation. Meanwhile, Standard Chartered forecasts that BNB could more than double in value by the end of 2025 and reach $2,775 by 2028, citing its strong correlation with Bitcoin and Ethereum and the continued dominance of Binance’s exchange platform. CZ Predicts Bitcoin Could Reach $1 Million in Current Market Cycle, Citing Institutional and Governmental Adoption Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, co-founder of Binance and one of the most influential voices in the cryptocurrency industry, has made one of his boldest predictions yet: Bitcoin could surge to as high as $1 million during the current market cycle. In a wide-ranging interview with Rug Radio published on May 5, Zhao pointed to a confluence of accelerating trends—including institutional investment through spot Bitcoin ETFs and direct government accumulation—as key drivers of the bullish outlook. “There’s the ETFs. There’s this institutionalization of Bitcoin … it’s a positive in terms of price action, obviously. Our bags are up — not the alt‑coins as much, but at least Bitcoin is,” Zhao said. Zhao’s remarks highlight what many in the crypto community are witnessing firsthand: traditional financial institutions are finally entering the space in a meaningful way. He credited the recent explosion in spot Bitcoin ETFs as a primary reason for the asset’s upward momentum. Indeed, this institutional wave has not gone unnoticed by analysts. Alex Obchakevich, founder of Obchakevich Research, recently said that institutional money now accounts for the lion’s share of Bitcoin’s recent gains. He added that ETFs, particularly those tracking Bitcoin, are acting as a key engine behind the bullish trend, even though they may be accompanied by short-term volatility. Governments Join the Bitcoin Movement Beyond Wall Street, sovereign states are also quietly ramping up their Bitcoin holdings. Zhao emphasized this growing trend, calling it both a validation of Bitcoin’s role in the financial system and a catalyst for its price. His comments come just days after El Salvador—the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender—announced the purchase of an additional 7 BTC, bringing its total to nearly 6,170 BTC, valued at around $580 million. The country has remained resolute in its Bitcoin acquisition strategy despite criticisms from organizations such as the International Monetary Fund. Bhutan, too, is making moves. Reports from January 2025 revealed that the Himalayan kingdom is planning a new economic hub with a strategic reserve of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ether, as part of its long-term financial infrastructure. Zhao also pointed to a surprising new tailwind: the reversal of anti-crypto sentiment at the highest levels of US government. With the election of President Donald Trump, Zhao observed a stark pivot in national policy toward embracing digital assets. A Warning for Retail Investors While his tone was generally optimistic, Zhao offered a sobering observation for latecomers to the Bitcoin party. “Retail had 15 years to buy,” he said. “If they’re late now, that was their choice.” This comment signals a growing sentiment in the crypto space: the era of easy retail accumulation may be drawing to a close as institutional and governmental actors increasingly dominate the market. Zhao’s forecast of $500,000 to $1 million per BTC is not without precedent. Similar predictions have been made by ARK Invest’s Cathie Wood and others, but it’s Zhao’s unique vantage point—both as an industry veteran and the former head of the world’s largest crypto exchange—that gives the statement added weight. His bullish case hinges on continued institutional flows via ETFs, further sovereign accumulation, and favorable political developments—particularly in the United States. While skeptics may balk at such lofty numbers, the convergence of these powerful forces presents a compelling narrative that could reshape the financial landscape in the years ahead. Standard Chartered Predicts BNB Could Surge to $2,775 by 2028, Citing Price Parity With Bitcoin and Ethereum Meanwhile, global banking giant and asset manager Standard Chartered has issued a bullish long-term forecast for BNB, the native cryptocurrency of Binance’s BNB Chain, projecting that the token could more than double in value by the end of 2025 and climb nearly fivefold to $2,775 by 2028. The forecast, included in a newly published analyst report, comes as the digital asset trades around $598 per token, with a fully diluted valuation of approximately $84 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data . Standard Chartered’s analysis suggests a strong upward trajectory for BNB, driven by its price correlation with Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as the continued dominance of Binance as a global exchange player. “BNB has traded almost exactly in line with an unweighted basket of Bitcoin and Ethereum since May 2021 in terms of both returns and volatility,” wrote Geoff Kendrick, head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered. “We expect this relationship to continue to hold, driving BNB’s price from around $600 currently to $2,775 by end-2028.” Price forecasts for BNB (Source: Standard Chartered) In a broader market context, Standard Chartered’s research points to BNB potentially emerging as a benchmark asset within the crypto space. While Bitcoin has long been regarded as the standard-bearer for store-of-value narratives and Ethereum as the innovation engine behind decentralized applications, BNB’s close tracking of both assets may position it as a market “average” in terms of price performance and sentiment. “Given this, we see potential for BNB to serve as a form of benchmark, or average, for digital asset prices more broadly,” Kendrick stated in the report. This benchmark hypothesis hinges largely on the assumption that Binance—the world’s largest centralized exchange by trading volume—continues to maintain its market dominance. As long as Binance retains this stature, the token that underpins its operations is unlikely to experience significant deviation from its current value model. A Conservative but Stable Ecosystem Despite its impressive valuation and performance projections, BNB’s underlying blockchain—BNB Chain—is not known for groundbreaking innovation or developer growth. Compared to developer-rich ecosystems like Ethereum, Solana, or Avalanche, BNB Chain has often been viewed as “old-fashioned,” a term used directly in the report. BNB’s ecosystem is heavy on DEXs (Source: Standard Chartered) Nonetheless, Standard Chartered interprets this conservative composition as a potential stabilizing factor. The report highlighted that more than 60% of BNB Chain’s on-chain activity stems from decentralized exchanges (DEXs), suggesting a reliable and transaction-heavy user base that isn't as susceptible to speculative or fleeting trends like NFTs or meme coins. While this concentration may limit the diversity of applications on BNB Chain, it also reinforces its utility within DeFi, making it an efficient and predictable platform—especially appealing for institutions that prioritize consistency and scalability. Standard Chartered’s optimistic forecast follows a wave of institutional interest in BNB and other crypto assets. Just one day before the report was publicized, asset manager VanEck filed to list the first-ever BNB exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States. If approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the BNB ETF could pave the way for more traditional investors to gain exposure to the token through regulated financial channels. VanEck’s move mirrors a broader trend seen with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, which have funneled billions in capital into the digital asset market and are credited with catalyzing recent rallies in crypto prices. As spot crypto ETFs become increasingly mainstream, BNB’s chances of being viewed as a serious long-term investment asset may further improve, especially if Binance’s presence in the global market remains strong. Looking Ahead: A $1,275 Target by 2025 Standard Chartered’s forecast doesn’t just look to the distant horizon. The firm expects BNB to reach approximately $1,275 by the end of 2025—more than double its current valuation. This shorter-term target reflects a combination of market momentum, continued ETF developments, and the macro-level growth of crypto as a whole.

This is evidenced by the fact that there are now a large majority of crypto traders who are choosing to bet on a recovery for the meme coin rather than further decline. This is mostly visible on Binance, which is the world’s largest exchange, seeing a sharp drop in short accounts in favor of traders who are long on Dogecoin. 72% Of Binance Traders Are Bullish According to data from Coinglass, there are presently more bulls as regards to the Dogecoin price compared to bears. The Long/Short Ratio on the website helps to map out where crypto traders are leaning and how they are placing their bets. Using percentages, it shows how the vast majority are betting in regards to any coin and exchange, and for Binance, the results have shown more longs than shorts. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Calls Wave 5 To Send XRP Price Above $6 Currently, of all open bets on Dogecoin on the Binance crypto exchange, a whopping 72.46% are long at the time of this writing. This leaves only a smaller percentage of 27.54% of traders who are short. On this account, it shows that bullishness is on the rise for the meme coin. Interestingly, this turn in sentiment seems to be mostly localized to the Binance exchange. Looking at the broader Long/Short Ratio for Dogecoin, there are still more shorts than longs. Total exchanges figures comes out to 51.86% of all open bets in the market currently being short, coming out to over $1.15 billion at the time of this writing. In contrast, only 48.19% of open bets are in favor of longs, coming out to less than $1.1 billion. This gap, despite being quite small, shows that sellers are still dominating the market now. This would explain the decline in the Dogecoin price despite the daily trading volume rising above $700 million. Can The Dogecoin Price Recover? The open interest when it comes to Dogecoin is still quite low as traders are trading more conservatively right now. This has followed the price decline and the fear sentiment that has gripped the market. However, times like these are usually when reversals begin, with many not expecting one. Related Reading: Ethereum Macro Trend Oscillator Shows Green Might Be On The Horizon A crypto analyst has also pointed out that the Dogecoin price is forming a strong Ascending Wedge pattern. Now, if this pattern is completed, it could put the meme coin on the path to a long-lasting rally. The target for this has been placed at $1.161, meaning the analyst is expecting the Dogecoin price to explode by more than 580% from here.

44273555,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157990,1746612056,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Intella X: Neowiz Announces Shocking Blockchain Gaming Platform Discontinuation,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/intella-x-discontinuation/,"The world of crypto gaming is constantly evolving, sometimes bringing unexpected news. Recently, the community received surprising news from South Korean online game giant Neowiz regarding its foray into the blockchain space. What’s Happening with Intella X ? Neowiz’s dedicated blockchain gaming platform , known as Intella X, has officially announced its decision to cease operations. The announcement, made via their official X (formerly Twitter) account, signals a significant shift in the company’s approach to blockchain technology and gaming. This move means that the Intella X platform services and all related offerings will be discontinued. The company cited a shift towards a new business direction as the primary reason for this decision. Which Services Face Platform Discontinuation ? The shutdown is comprehensive, affecting various components that made up the Intella X ecosystem. Users and participants in the platform should be aware of the specific services that are being terminated. These include: The core Intella X platform services itself. The onboarding game A.V.A (Alliance of Valiant Arms), which was integrated into the platform. The Intella X wallet, crucial for managing digital assets within the ecosystem. The NFT marketplace and launchpad, platforms for trading and launching blockchain-based assets. Airdrop services, including specific programs like Adventure, Mission Page, and ERCC: Meow Simulator. Alphastarter, likely a platform related to initial project offerings or access. This extensive list highlights that the discontinuation is not partial but a full winding down of the current Intella X infrastructure. Does This Mean Neowiz is Leaving Blockchain Entirely? While the discontinuation of Intella X is a major development, it’s important to note that this does not necessarily mean Neowiz is completely abandoning its interest in blockchain ventures. According to a report by Yonhap, Neowiz clarified this point, indicating that while the platform is shutting down, the company’s exploration and potential future involvement in the blockchain space are not entirely off the table. This suggests that Neowiz might be exploring alternative strategies, different blockchain technologies, or perhaps focusing on different aspects of the Web3 space that do not involve the current Intella X platform model. The exact nature of this ‘new business direction’ remains to be fully detailed, but the clarification provides a glimmer of hope that Neowiz hasn’t lost faith in the underlying technology, even if its initial implementation faced challenges or no longer aligns with corporate strategy. Challenges and Implications for Crypto Gaming Users The discontinuation of a platform like Intella X presents several challenges, particularly for its users and the broader crypto gaming ecosystem: Loss of Access: Users lose access to the platform, wallet, and associated services. Asset Management: Users need to understand how this affects any digital assets (NFTs, tokens, etc.) they held within the Intella X ecosystem or its associated games. Clear communication from Neowiz on asset migration or withdrawal procedures is crucial. Developer Impact: Game developers planning to onboard or already integrated with Intella X will need to find alternative platforms or adjust their strategies. Market Perception: Platform shutdowns, while sometimes necessary, can impact investor and user confidence in the stability and longevity of specific projects within the blockchain gaming sector. For users, the actionable insight is to stay informed via official Neowiz/Intella X channels regarding shutdown timelines and any procedures for asset recovery or management. It’s a stark reminder of the dynamic and sometimes volatile nature of emerging technology markets. What Could Neowiz’s New Direction Involve? Given that Neowiz stated they aren’t entirely leaving blockchain, their new direction could potentially involve: Focusing on integrating blockchain elements directly into their existing, successful traditional games rather than building a separate platform. Exploring different blockchain networks or Layer 2 solutions that might offer better scalability, lower costs, or different features. Investing in or partnering with other blockchain companies rather than building their own infrastructure from scratch. Developing blockchain tools or services for other developers. Waiting for the market and technology to mature further before launching a new initiative. While speculative, these possibilities highlight that a platform shutdown doesn’t always mean an end to a company’s interest in the underlying technology, but rather a strategic pivot based on lessons learned and market conditions. Conclusion: A Shift for Neowiz in the Blockchain Gaming Platform Space The decision to discontinue the Intella X blockchain gaming platform marks a significant moment for Neowiz and the users who were part of its ecosystem. It underscores the challenges faced by companies navigating the nascent and rapidly changing Web3 landscape. While the Intella X chapter is closing, Neowiz’s clarification suggests they are not exiting the blockchain space entirely, but rather seeking a new path forward. This event serves as a valuable case study on the complexities of building and maintaining dedicated blockchain platforms in the competitive world of crypto gaming .

Blockchain security firm CertiK revealed on May 6 that the hacker transferred 100 Ether, valued at approximately $182,783, through crypto mixing service Tornado Cash. According to CertiK’s investigation, the wallet address used in the transaction was inactive for 166 days, with no movement since November. The address is linked to the original exploit and can be traced to earlier activity involving the hacker. #CertiKInsight 🚨 Our alerting system has detected @TornadoCash deposits of 100 ETH from 0xCF4823dA7271fdedBe103500d8E197Bdca224B6d. The fund traces to ~$4M Voltage Finance exploit on Fuse back in March 2022. Stay Vigilant! pic.twitter.com/eyqH1HbN3F — CertiK Alert (@CertiKAlert) May 6, 2025 The blockchain security firm also explained that the hacker used Tornado Cash, which was sanctioned by the US Treasury in 2022 for facilitating money laundering, to obscure blockchain transactions and prevent investigators from tracing the fund movements. Voltage Finance original 2022 exploit Voltage was hacked on March 31, 2022, and the hacker made away with an estimated $4.67 million in digital tokens. They reportedly took advantage of a vulnerability in a token standard, ERC677, through a built-in callback function. The function allowed them to execute a reentrancy attack to successfully drain funds from the platform’s lending pool. In the initial phase of the attack, the culprit used a flash loan of 515 Wrapped Ether (WETH) from the WETH-WBTC pair on Voltage Finance to initiate the exploit. Voltage Finance operates as a decentralized protocol enabling automated token trading on the Fuse network. The attacker exploited this infrastructure by manipulating the platform’s smart contracts using wrapped tokens and flash loans. Ola Finance, the multi-protocol network that supports Voltage, issued a post-mortem two days after the incident that showed the exploit was specific to its Fuse deployment. The developers stated that similar attacks would not affect other lending networks under Ola’s ecosystem. In total, the attacker siphoned off 216,964.18 USDC, 507,216.68 BUSD, 200,000 fUSD, 550.45 Wrapped Ether (wETH), 26.25 Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC), and 1,240,000 FUSE tokens. “ In later transactions, the attacker avoided a flash loan by using the funds that had already been stolen ,” Ola stated in its report. Another exploit hits in March 2025 Voltage Finance was hit again in a separate exploit on March 18 this year, involving its Simple Staking pools. This time, the unauthorized withdrawal led to the theft of $171,027.20 in USDCE and $151,085.87 in wETH. The platform paused activities on the pool to stop the fund drainage, and said it was “working urgently to identify the hacker.” According to a March 20 Medium report from Voltage Finance, the attack began when a second unknown party, referred to as Attacker 2, withdrew ETH from crypto exchange HTX. Attacker 2 transferred the stolen assets to Attacker 1, who used the money to purchase FUSE tokens via ChangeNow, bridged to the network through LayerZero. From there, the stolen assets were bridged back to Ethereum and moved through several wallets and transactions.The funds were then passed from Attacker 1 to Attacker 3, who received additional funds via SimpleSwap. Attacker 3 deposited some of the tokens into the KuCoin exchange, but swapped and withdrew others back to the first hacker to complete the laundering loop. “ Since your transactions passed through KuCoin, we have initiated cooperation to identify you. We prefer resolving this situation peacefully. We’re offering a bounty of $50K upon the return of all funds, ” Voltage Finance said to the hacker in its X post. According to a recent report by blockchain security firm Immunefi, losses from crypto-related hacks and exploits have reached $1.74 billion so far this year, already surpassing the $1.49 billion total recorded in all of 2024. The 2025 year-to-date total is a nearly fourfold increase from the $420 million reported during the same period in 2024.

This move underscores a growing trend among forward-thinking corporations globally to embrace Bitcoin as a strategic treasury asset. Breaking News: Metaplanet Boosts Bitcoin Holdings Metaplanet recently shared via an official announcement on X that it has acquired an additional 555 BTC. This latest purchase brings the company’s total Metaplanet Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 5,555 BTC. The company, already known for its pro-Bitcoin stance and strategy, continues to solidify its position as a leader in corporate BTC investment within Japan. This specific acquisition of 555 BTC is notable not just for its size, but also for adding to an already significant treasury. The total holding of 5,555 BTC is a substantial amount for a publicly traded company, especially one based in Japan, a nation with unique economic dynamics and regulatory considerations regarding digital assets. Why is Metaplanet’s Bitcoin Investment a Key Moment for Japan? Metaplanet’s consistent and growing Bitcoin investment strategy is particularly impactful within the Japanese market. Japan is a major global economy, but corporate Bitcoin adoption has perhaps lagged behind some Western counterparts until recently. Metaplanet’s actions serve as a prominent example and potential catalyst for other Japanese firms. Here’s why this is significant for Japan Bitcoin adoption: Setting a Precedent: As a publicly listed company, Metaplanet’s transparent embrace of Bitcoin provides a roadmap and builds confidence for other Japanese corporations considering similar moves. Diversification Strategy: It signals a recognition of Bitcoin’s potential as a hedge against yen depreciation and global economic uncertainty, offering a new avenue for treasury management beyond traditional assets. Regulatory Navigation: Metaplanet’s successful integration of Bitcoin into its balance sheet demonstrates that navigating Japan’s regulatory environment for digital assets is achievable for corporations. Raising Awareness: High-profile moves like this bring mainstream attention to Bitcoin and digital assets within Japan, potentially increasing public and corporate interest. Metaplanet is effectively pioneering corporate Bitcoin adoption in a market ripe for digital asset innovation. How Does Metaplanet Approach Its BTC Investment Strategy? Metaplanet has been quite vocal about its rationale for accumulating Bitcoin. Their strategy aligns with the view that Bitcoin serves as a robust store of value and a hedge against inflation and currency debasement. This perspective is shared by a growing number of institutions and corporations globally. Their approach involves: Viewing BTC as a Long-Term Reserve Asset: Not a short-term trade, but a fundamental component of their treasury strategy intended to preserve capital over time. Mitigating Fiat Currency Risks: Using Bitcoin to counter the potential loss of purchasing power associated with holding large reserves in traditional fiat currencies like the Japanese Yen. Strategic Capital Allocation: Periodically allocating available capital to Bitcoin purchases, demonstrating a commitment to increasing their exposure over time. This consistent accumulation strategy, as seen with the recent 555 BTC addition, highlights their conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. Is Institutional Bitcoin Adoption Growing Globally? Metaplanet is part of a larger, accelerating trend of institutional Bitcoin adoption. While MicroStrategy remains the largest corporate holder by a significant margin, an increasing number of companies are adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. This includes not just corporations, but also asset managers via instruments like Bitcoin ETFs, and even some sovereign wealth funds are rumored to be exploring the space. Comparing Metaplanet to other key players provides context: Company Headquarters Total BTC Holdings (Approx.) Primary Strategy MicroStrategy USA ~214,400 BTC Primary treasury reserve asset Metaplanet Japan 5,555 BTC Treasury reserve asset, inflation hedge Tesla USA ~9,720 BTC Corporate treasury (partial) Note: Holdings figures are approximate and subject to change based on company announcements. This table illustrates that while Metaplanet’s holdings are smaller than giants like MicroStrategy, they are substantial and place the company among notable corporate Bitcoin holders globally. The key takeaway is the diversification of this trend geographically and across different industries. What are the Benefits and Potential Challenges of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings? Adopting a BTC investment strategy comes with potential rewards and risks. Companies like Metaplanet weigh these carefully. Potential Benefits: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin’s fixed supply is seen by many as protection against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Potential Appreciation: If Bitcoin’s value continues to grow, the corporate treasury’s value increases. Diversification: Provides an asset uncorrelated (or less correlated) with traditional financial markets. Attracting Talent/Investors: Signals a forward-thinking, technologically savvy approach that can appeal to certain employees and investors. Increased Visibility: Corporate holdings often generate significant media attention. Potential Challenges: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can be highly volatile, potentially impacting the reported value of treasury holdings. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving in many jurisdictions, including Japan. Accounting Treatment: Accounting rules for digital assets can be complex and may require frequent impairment testing if the price drops. Security Risks: Holding significant amounts of Bitcoin requires robust security measures to prevent theft or loss. Public Perception: Some traditional investors or stakeholders may be skeptical of cryptocurrency investments. Metaplanet’s continued purchases suggest they believe the long-term benefits outweigh the risks associated with holding Bitcoin . What Can Investors Learn from Metaplanet’s Strategic Move? Metaplanet’s actions offer several insights for individual and institutional investors watching the space: Long-Term Conviction: Corporate treasury strategies like Metaplanet’s are typically long-term. This reinforces the idea that Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a generational asset. Importance of Research: Understanding the rationale behind a company’s Bitcoin investment helps assess its overall financial strategy and risk tolerance. Diversification Potential: The corporate world is increasingly seeing the value of including non-traditional assets like Bitcoin in a diversified portfolio. Monitoring Corporate Adoption: Tracking which companies are adding Bitcoin can provide signals about growing mainstream acceptance and potential future demand. Metaplanet’s strategic move is a case study in how companies are adapting their financial strategies in response to global economic changes and the rise of digital assets. What’s Next for Japan and Institutional Bitcoin Adoption? Metaplanet’s continued leadership in Japan Bitcoin adoption raises questions about what the future holds. Will other major Japanese corporations follow suit? Increased corporate interest could potentially lead to: More tailored financial products and services for corporate crypto holdings in Japan. Potential adjustments or clarifications in accounting and tax regulations for digital assets held by companies. Increased trading volume and liquidity in the Japanese crypto market. A broader acceptance of Bitcoin and other digital assets within Japan’s financial ecosystem. Metaplanet’s 5,555 BTC holding is not just a number; it’s a symbol of a potential shift in corporate financial strategy within a major Asian economy, pushing the boundaries of institutional Bitcoin adoption . Conclusion: A Bold Step in the World of Corporate Bitcoin Metaplanet’s latest acquisition of 555 BTC, bringing their total to 5,555 BTC, is a significant event for both the company and the broader cryptocurrency market, particularly in Asia. It reinforces the narrative of increasing institutional Bitcoin adoption and positions Metaplanet as a pioneer in integrating Bitcoin into corporate treasury strategy within Japan. This move highlights the growing confidence among forward-thinking companies in Bitcoin’s role as a long-term store of value and a hedge against economic instability. As more companies globally, and specifically in key markets like Japan, make similar BTC investment decisions, the foundation for Bitcoin’s place in the global financial system continues to strengthen. Metaplanet’s strategic commitment is a clear signal that corporate Bitcoin adoption is not just a trend, but a potentially enduring shift.

The token last changed hands at $2.0995 on Binance when the snapshot was published, down 0.16% on the session but hovering only a few cents above the 38.2% retracement of the late-April rally. XRP Is Building Momentum Explaining the significance of the current pullback, CasiTrades wrote, “Momentum is starting to pick up, and XRP is dropping to one of the most critical support tests we’ve seen in weeks.” The chart anchors its Fibonacci grid on the $2.3622 swing high set April 28 and the $1.6169 low printed April; 7 from that range, the 38.2% retracement lies at $2.0775, the 50% cutback at $1.9896, and the golden-ratio 61.8% level at $1.9016. CasiTrades highlights the 38.2–50% corridor from $2.078 to $2.00 as “the key support region”, adding: “This zone has acted as a pivot point in the past, and it’s where we could see the market start to turn if strength returns.” Related Reading: Major XRP Accumulation Alert: Wallets Holding Over 10,000 Coins Cross 300,000 Price action since the $2.36 high is mapped as a textbook A-B-C corrective pattern. Wave (A) carried XRP below the 23.6% retracement at $2.1863; wave (B) attempted to retest overhead supply but stalled just shy of the peak; and the active wave (C) is sketched by a magenta arrow pointing directly into the $2.00-to-$1.90 pocket. “We may still see one more flush or surprise drop targeting the major $1.90 before momentum shifts,” the analyst cautioned, noting that such moves tend to “move quickly, and by the time it’s obvious, the opportunity will probably be gone.” Internally, momentum is already hinting at exhaustion. The one-hour RSI has carved successive higher lows from the end of April through early May even as spot prices have edged lower, forming a clear bullish divergence accentuated by a rising black trend-line. The oscillator is drifting just under the 40 handle, suggesting selling pressure is losing force as price drills into support. “On the lower timeframes, RSI is showing signs of selling exhaustion, and the price action is beginning to compress, often a signal that a bigger move is on the horizon,” CasiTrades observed.

A crimson band near $2.2559 marks the 38.2% retracement of an earlier macro impulse and is flagged as “.382 major support” turned resistance until reclaimed. Beyond that, the 11.8 percent line crosses at $2.2743, with the prior peak at $2.36 capping the short-term range. “Off these supports, we’re looking for XRP to gain the strength to break past $2.25, $2.68, and beyond,” the analyst told followers, adding, “This is the time to be alert!” In the comment thread, traders debated whether Bitcoin and Wednesday’s Federal Reserve decision could deliver the final leg lower. “I’m thinking so too… ideally support tests are met with extreme strength and an impressive recovery,” CasiTrades replied. When asked where he would initiate a long, he advocated a laddered approach: “Ideally you’d ladder, $2.08, $2.00, and $1.90—sub-waves are pointing to $2.00 as the highest probable pivot support.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.14.

44276341,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158056,1746617455,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Exciting Development: Binance Alpha Features ZKJ Token (Polyhedra Network),https://bitcoinworld.co.in/binance-alpha-zkj-token/,"Big news from the world of crypto! If you’re keeping an eye on emerging projects, you’ll want to know that Binance Alpha , a dedicated feature within the widely used Binance Wallet , has just added the ZKJ token from Polyhedra Network to its curated list. This move, initially reported by BWEnews on X, shines a spotlight on Polyhedra Network and its native token within a key Binance ecosystem component. What Exactly is Binance Alpha? Think of Binance Alpha as a discovery zone for promising new digital assets. It’s not the main Binance exchange where you trade billions daily, but rather a feature integrated into the Binance Wallet . Its primary goal is to highlight what it considers to be high-potential, early stage crypto projects before they potentially gain wider traction. Here’s how Binance Alpha typically operates: It lives within the non-custodial Binance Wallet , giving users direct access to interact with featured tokens. Projects are selected based on specific criteria, often including community engagement, technological innovation, and market trends among emerging protocols. Inclusion is intended to provide visibility and potentially early access for users interested in cutting-edge blockchain technology. It’s crucial to understand that being featured on Binance Alpha is a form of recognition and exposure, but it comes with a very important caveat. Why Was the ZKJ Token Added to Binance Alpha? The addition of the ZKJ token is a significant development for Polyhedra Network . While Binance doesn’t always disclose the exact proprietary formula for Alpha selections, the general criteria mentioned – community engagement and market trends among early stage crypto projects – likely played a role. Polyhedra Network is known for its focus on zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, particularly in the realm of interoperability and scaling solutions. The ZKJ token is central to its ecosystem, often used for transaction fees, governance, or other utility functions within the network. Factors that might have contributed to its selection could include: Growing interest and activity within the Polyhedra Network community. The relevance and potential impact of its ZK technology in addressing current blockchain challenges. Positive market sentiment or notable developments surrounding the project. For Polyhedra Network , this inclusion provides valuable visibility to a large audience of Binance Wallet users, potentially driving interest and adoption of the network and its ZKJ token . Understanding the Nuance: Alpha vs. Main Exchange Listing Here’s where careful attention is needed. The news explicitly states that inclusion on Binance Alpha does not guarantee a future listing on the main Binance exchange. This is a critical distinction for anyone looking at the ZKJ token . Binance Alpha is more about showcasing potentially interesting early stage crypto projects within the wallet environment, allowing users to explore and interact with these tokens directly via their decentralized wallet. A main Binance exchange listing, on the other hand, involves a rigorous due diligence process and signifies the token is available for spot or derivatives trading to millions of users globally on the centralized platform. This typically leads to significant increases in liquidity and accessibility. Think of it like this: Feature Binance Alpha / Wallet Integration Main Binance Exchange Listing Location Within Binance Wallet (non-custodial) Main Binance Exchange Platform (centralized) Purpose Highlighting early stage crypto , exploration Trading, liquidity, broad accessibility Due Diligence Criteria focused on trends, community, tech Extensive review (legal, technical, market, compliance) Guaranteed Listing? NO Yes (it IS the listing) User Interaction Often via DApps, staking, direct token interaction Spot/Futures trading pairs So, while the ZKJ token being on Binance Alpha is positive news for Polyhedra Network and brings it into the orbit of the Binance Wallet user base, it should not be interpreted as an imminent or guaranteed exchange listing. What Does This Mean for Users Interested in Early Stage Crypto? For users who utilize the Binance Wallet and are interested in exploring early stage crypto projects, the addition of the ZKJ token makes it more visible and potentially easier to interact with the Polyhedra Network ecosystem directly through their wallet. Here are some actionable insights: Increased Visibility: If you browse Binance Alpha within your wallet, you’ll now see Polyhedra Network and the ZKJ token highlighted. Potential Access: Depending on the wallet’s features and integration, this might facilitate easier access to dApps or services within the Polyhedra Network that utilize the ZKJ token . Research Opportunity: This serves as a signal to investigate Polyhedra Network further. What is their technology? What problems do they solve? What is the utility of the ZKJ token ? Manage Expectations: Remember the ‘no guarantee’ clause regarding a main exchange listing. Any investment decisions should be based on the fundamentals of Polyhedra Network and the utility of the ZKJ token , not speculation about a future listing. As with all early stage crypto projects, the risks are higher. Do your own research (DYOR) diligently before engaging with or investing in the ZKJ token or any project featured on platforms like Binance Alpha . Benefits and Challenges of Being on Binance Alpha For Polyhedra Network and the ZKJ token , being featured on Binance Alpha offers clear benefits: Enhanced Exposure: Direct visibility to a large, crypto-savvy user base within the Binance Wallet ecosystem. Credibility Boost: Association with the Binance brand, even in a limited capacity, can lend a degree of perceived credibility. Potential User Growth: Increased awareness could lead to more users exploring the Polyhedra Network and interacting with the ZKJ token . However, challenges and risks remain: No Listing Guarantee: The biggest challenge is managing the expectation that this isn’t a golden ticket to the main exchange. Market Volatility: Early stage crypto tokens, including the ZKJ token , are often subject to high volatility. Project Execution Risk: As an early project, Polyhedra Network still needs to execute its roadmap and prove its long-term viability. Conclusion: A Step Forward for Polyhedra Network The inclusion of the ZKJ token from Polyhedra Network on Binance Alpha is undoubtedly a positive development, bringing increased visibility within the expansive Binance Wallet ecosystem. It highlights Polyhedra Network as a project catching the eye in the early stage crypto space, potentially due to its focus on zero-knowledge technology and community traction. While exciting, it is absolutely essential for users and potential investors to remember that this is distinct from a main Binance exchange listing and comes with no guarantee of such a future event. It serves as an invitation to explore Polyhedra Network and the ZKJ token further through the Binance Wallet , but robust personal research remains paramount before making any decisions.

Through a recent post on X, Farina suggested that if each of his 158,000 followers simultaneously placed a $50 buy order for XRP, it would inject approximately $8 million in instant liquidity into the market. This strategy aims to test the resilience of XRP’s price against alleged suppressive forces. The Motivation Behind the Move Farina’s proposal is rooted in his longstanding belief that XRP’s price does not accurately reflect its intrinsic value, despite numerous positive developments. He has been vocal about the potential manipulation of XRP’s market price, citing instances where significant partnerships and legal victories failed to yield expected price surges. For example, despite Ripple’s legal wins against the SEC and strategic acquisitions, XRP’s price remained relatively stagnant, leading Farina to question the integrity of market dynamics. I have 158,000 followers. What if each of us sets a $50 $XRP buy order at the same time… just to see what happens? That’s $8M in instant liquidity. Let’s put the market manipulators to the test. If we spread the word, even more. 1,000 comments and I’ll schedule the event. — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) May 6, 2025 A Part of Broader Advocacy for XRP This initiative is not an isolated event but part of Farina’s broader advocacy for XRP’s long-term potential. He has consistently urged investors to adopt a patient approach, emphasizing that premature selling could result in missed opportunities. Farina often draws parallels between XRP and Bitcoin’s early days, suggesting that XRP’s current undervaluation mirrors Bitcoin’s past, where early investors who sold at $500 missed out on its eventual surge to over $100,000. Future Predictions and Market Sentiments Farina predicts that XRP could reach unprecedented heights , with projections surpassing $100. He envisions a future where XRP becomes a standard currency, especially after the anticipated conclusion of the SEC lawsuit in the second quarter of 2025. Such regulatory clarity could pave the way for broader institutional adoption, potentially driving demand and price appreciation. Warning Against Premature Selling However, Farina also warned of the psychological barriers that might prompt retail investors to sell prematurely. He anticipates significant sell-offs at price milestones like $10, $20, and $50, as investors might be tempted to realize gains without considering the asset’s long-term potential. Farina cautions against this short-term mindset, suggesting that holding onto XRP could yield more substantial returns in the future.

By uniting investors in a collective action, Farina aims to demonstrate the power of grassroots movements in influencing market dynamics. Whether this initiative will achieve its intended effect remains to be seen, but it undeniably underscores the growing frustration among XRP supporters regarding the token’s market performance. As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, actions like Farina’s highlight the tension between decentralized communities and traditional market forces. The outcome of this proposed experiment could offer valuable insights into the efficacy of collective investor actions and the extent of market manipulation in the crypto space.

Stablecoin giant Tether ( USDT ) has rolled out its USDT stablecoin on the Kaia blockchain , expanding its reach to users of LINE Messenger, a popular Korean social media platform. According to a Wednesday press release , the partnership enables over 196 million monthly users of LINE to access and use USDT for payments, rewards, and decentralized finance directly within the app. Tether’s CEO Paolo Ardoino says that through LINE NEXT’s blockchain infrastructure, “over 200 million LINE users will now have a straightforward way to engage with digital assets in everyday life.” “With the lowest transaction latency among EVM chains and immediate finality, Kaia’s USDT will provide the fastest, easiest, and most reliable user experience available across platforms such as LINE, DeFi, and CEXs.” Sam Seo, chairman of Kaia DLT Foundation You might also like: Tether holds more than 7.7 tons of gold backing its XAUT token Per the announcement, USDT will be integrated with LINE’s Mini Dapps and self-custodial wallet.

The move coincides with Tether’s increased lobbying efforts in Washington, D.C., aimed at influencing crypto regulation as pro-crypto sentiment grows under President Donald Trump. As crypto.news reported earlier, Tether is planning to launch a U.S.-based dollar-pegged stablecoin by the end of 2025.

According to a recent official announcement on X, Monda has officially rebranded to Purps exchange. The platform’s new home is now Purps.xyz , with the old domain Monda.fund fully redirected. In a follow-up post, the company explained the reasons behind the rebrand. First, the former name “Monda” unintentionally clashed with other “Mon-” projects in the Monad ecosystem, leading to confusion and reputational setbacks. The move to Purps also reflects the exchange’s maturation. As the DEX rapidly scaled, the team felt it had outgrown the “Mon-da” label and needed a name that stood independently, without direct ties to Monad itself. The new name, Purps, not only captures with the platform’s signature purple theme but also carries a clever nod to its core offering—20x perps trading .

Recent technicals show a well-formed ascending triangle pattern, with resistance at $26–28 and a breakout target around $33–35. On-chain volume has rebounded with a sharp rise to $5.27B on May 6, reflecting renewed trader participation and liquidity inflow. Heavy long liquidation zones around $50K–$82K and short squeeze risk building above $103K, hinting at possible volatility spikes. With the current momentum and pattern strength, HYPE looks positioned to retest its ATH of $35 within the next 4–6 weeks if resistance flips support. Hyperliquid (HYPE) has made a strong resurgence with 105% jump in value in one month, back above the critical $20 mark. HYPE is now priced at $21.18 (+5.39% daily) at a market cap of $7.07B and 24h volume of $127.66M (+47.19%). The coin reached an all-time high (ATH) of $35.02 on Dec 21, 2024 (~40% off ATH), and several traders are hoping for a portfolio full reversal. HYPE’s momentum is attributed to the following catalysts: HYPE’s New Fee & Staking System Announcement (launched May 5): Hyperliquid introduced a fee and staking system on May 5. Users can now stake their HYPE coins to receive a trading fee discount of between 5% and 40%, depending on the amount staked. The fee discount uses different rates for futures and spots; spot volume counts as double for fee tier calculations. And a big upgrade comes from linking staking and trading accounts, so the discounts apply to any trading account and will incentivise all traders to engage and provide liquidity to the platform. Ethena’s USDe Stablecoin After Launch: Ethena Labs has integrated its USDe stablecoin into Hyperliquid’s DEX, and integrated USDe with its HyperEVM blockchain. Users who hold 100+ USDe on HyperCore are now eligible to earn daily rewards for holding USDe in their accounts that automatically air-drop to their spot accounts! This integration allows for better liquidity as it builds asset use cases for USDe, and increases interest from investors in the entire Hyperliquid crypto ecosystem. Bullish Setup: HYPE/USD Forms Ascending Triangle with $33–$35 Target in Sight HYPE Coin recently completed a strong V-shaped recovery and is now forming an ascending triangle —a bullish chart pattern that often leads to breakouts. The main support zone sits at $17.5–18.0 , which has held well during past dips. The key resistance zone is $26–28 , and this is the level to watch for a breakout. A Fibonacci retracement drawn from the previous high ($35) to the recent low ($10) shows that $26–28 also lines up with the important 0.618–0.786 Fib levels —making it a critical barrier where many traders expect a reaction. The chart also shows a neckline breakout , a positive sign that buyers are in control. The 20/50 EMA lines have crossed upward, confirming a bullish setup, and the RSI is around 66 , which shows good momentum but not overbought yet. The MACD also supports the bullish trend. If HYPE can close above $26–28 with strong volume , the next target is around $33–35 , its previous all-time high. Based on the current pace, this move could happen in the next 4–6 weeks . Liquidity & Liquidations: How On-Chain Data Confirms HYPE’s Breakout Potential Volume Surge: Confidence Rebuilding HYPE’s on-chain volume tells the story of a market regaining strength. After its big run earlier this year, volume cooled to around $2.39B by April 5, showing a pause in trader interest and liquidity as price corrected. But by May 6, daily volume jumped back to $5.27B—marking a strong resurgence of participation. This confirms that the current uptrend is supported by real buying power, not just a weak technical bounce. Liquidation Heatmap: Historical & Current Pressure Zones The liquidation map shows how traders have been positioned. During past corrections, especially after its all-time high, HYPE saw heavy long liquidations between $50K–$82K BTC equivalent, with a peak of 886 BTC liquidated at $82K. These events reveal where bulls were forced out, marking danger zones in bearish scenarios. Now, the tables are turning: shorts are heavily stacked between $103K–$142K, with recent spikes (e.g., 722 BTC at $103K) showing that many are betting against further upside. If HYPE Coin clears the $26–28 resistance, these shorts could get squeezed fast—likely triggering a surge toward the $33–35 ATH area.",Price Analysis|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|ENA,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-07 11:36:15

The move comes amid growing scrutiny over Trump-linked digital asset projects, including a meme coin that has drawn significant public attention. The proposed legislation , titled the Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement (MEME) Act, was unveiled on May 6 by Senator Chris Murphy. New Bill Aims to Ban Top US Officials from Promoting or Issuing Crypto The bill seeks to bar the president, vice president, members of Congress, senior executive officials, as well as their spouses and children, from issuing, sponsoring, or promoting digital assets, including securities, commodities, and futures. Violations could carry steep consequences: civil penalties up to $250,000 and the forfeiture of any profits to the U.S. Treasury. Criminal charges may also be pursued, with potential fines and prison sentences of up to five years. Representative Sam Liccardo has introduced a companion version in the House. However, with Republicans currently holding majorities in both chambers, the bill’s path forward remains uncertain. Today I’m introducing a bill – the MEME Act – to ban a President or Member of Congress from issuing a meme coin. The Trump Coin is the biggest corruption scandal in the history of the White House. @RepLiccardo and I are determined to put an end to this corruption – for good. pic.twitter.com/nQL9ZfIYYV — Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) May 6, 2025 In a parallel effort, Senator Richard Blumenthal, ranking member of the Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI), announced a preliminary probe into the Trump-affiliated TRUMP token and associated platform World Liberty Financial (WLFI). The subcommittee has requested documents and communications from the companies involved, including Fight Fight Fight—the developer behind the Trump coin. Investigators are focusing on potential conflicts of interest and financial benefits accruing to Trump, particularly from a recent price surge. On April 23, the TRUMP coin jumped nearly 50%, following an announcement that the top 220 holders would be invited to a gala at the White House. With his cryptocurrency schemes, Trump is putting a for sale sign in front of the White House. That’s why, as Ranking Member of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, I’m launching an inquiry into this brazen corruption whose scope & scale is staggering. pic.twitter.com/3SiaCrthN8 — Richard Blumenthal (@SenBlumenthal) May 6, 2025 The token, which launched on January 18, initially peaked at $73.43 before crashing to just over $11, according to CoinGecko. Blumenthal emphasized the importance of transparency and accountability, especially given the direct involvement of public figures in financial products. “These ventures raise serious ethical and legal questions,” he stated. Florida Latest State to Abondon Bitcoin Reserve Efforts In another development, Florida has become the latest US state to abandon efforts to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve, dealing another setback to the broader push for state-level crypto adoption. Two proposed bills — House Bill 487 and Senate Bill 550 — were officially withdrawn from the legislative process on May 3. The legislative session had adjourned a day earlier, on May 2, without taking action on the crypto-focused proposals. Their removal places Florida alongside a growing list of states — including Wyoming, South Dakota, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Montana, and Oklahoma — that have recently failed to pass legislation allowing Bitcoin-based investment strategies. According to BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, the United States is unlikely to significantly increase its Bitcoin holdings , citing the country’s ballooning national debt and the cultural image tied to Bitcoin investors. In a recent interview, Hayes cast doubt on the idea that the U.S. would proactively build a “strategic Bitcoin reserve,” beyond the nearly 200,000 BTC already in its possession.

This rigorous verification process confirms we hold sufficient assets to fully back client balances . We don’t just ask you to trust us – we ask you to cryptographically verify our custody of your cryptoassets. If you’re brand new to PoR, check out our What is Proof of Reserves? A Beginner’s Guide blog post. Our latest PoR Bitcoin reserve result: 114.9% coverage In our most recent PoR, we verified that we hold 192,091.25 BTC in our wallets, while customer balances total 167,188.68 BTC . This results in a reserve ratio of 114.9% , meaning we hold nearly 15% more Bitcoin than we owe to our users. Note our PoR doesn’t just include spot holdings – it also incorporates margin positions, futures balances and even staked assets. This holistic approach ensures that all types of customer exposure are considered. And there are other ways our PoR method continues to set the industry standard. Just what is PoR? PoR is a cryptographic process that allows cryptocurrency exchanges to publicly demonstrate that they hold user assets in full. Kraken uses a Merkle tree – a cryptographic data structure that compiles all user balances into a single root hash – allowing users to verify that their specific balances were included, without compromising personal privacy.A third party then verifies that the exchange’s onchain holdings are equal to or greater than total client balances. This helps confirm that we are not operating on fractional reserves. Not all PoRs are created equal While many exchanges now offer some form of what they call a PoR, our approach stands out in several key ways: Full liability inclusion We don’t just showcase assets – we also disclose client liabilities. Many platforms omit this crucial half of the equation, which can give a misleading impression of solvency. User-level verification tools We allow users to independently verify that their balances were included in the PoR process via Merkle tree proofs. This added transparency builds trust and accountability. Consistent and ongoing transparency We don’t treat PoR as a one-time PR exercise. Having pioneered the process in 2014, we conduct it routinely, ensuring users have consistent visibility into how the platform is managing their funds. Because “Take our word for it” isn’t good enough Following the collapse of several prominent crypto exchanges – most notably FTX – clients must demand transparency and accountability. PoR provides a clear, verifiable way for us to prove that client assets are safe and fully accounted for. Our high reserve ratio and user-verifiable methodology are a direct response to this need. It’s not just about saying funds are safe – nearly every exchange that has ever failed has promised client funds were safe. It’s about proving it: Cryptographically, independently and regularly. More proof, more often: Moving to a quarterly PoR cadence Looking ahead, we commit to releasing a PoR quarterly, along with our previous-quarter financial results, in an effort to provide even more frequent transparency. Additionally, we’re working toward expanding the scope of future PoRs to include a broader range of supported assets, further strengthening our commitment to accountability across the entire platform. Since 2014, we have been a leader in setting – and raising – the PoR standard for crypto holders seeking a trustworthy and forward-looking exchange.

44276688,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158057,1746618059,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin Futures: Understanding the Critical Long-Short Ratio for Smart Trading,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-futures-long-short/,"Navigating the cryptocurrency market can feel like reading tea leaves, but specific metrics offer valuable clues. One such indicator, particularly for those involved in derivatives, is the long-short ratio for Bitcoin futures . This ratio provides a snapshot of market sentiment, showing whether traders are predominantly betting on price increases (long) or decreases (short) on perpetual futures contracts. What Does the Long-Short Ratio Tell Us About BTC Trading? The long short ratio is a simple yet powerful metric. It’s calculated by dividing the total number of long positions by the total number of short positions on a specific asset or exchange. A ratio above 1 suggests more traders are long than short, indicating a generally bullish sentiment among derivatives traders. Conversely, a ratio below 1 points to a bearish sentiment, with more traders holding short positions. A ratio close to 1, like the data we’re examining, suggests a relatively balanced market sentiment or perhaps a period of indecision. Understanding this ratio is crucial for anyone engaged in BTC trading , especially on margin or futures platforms. While not a standalone trading signal, it helps gauge the prevailing sentiment and potential positioning of market participants. Extreme ratios can sometimes indicate potential reversals, as overcrowded trades become susceptible to liquidation cascades. Analyzing the Latest Bitcoin Futures Data Let’s dive into the specific 24-hour long-short ratios for Bitcoin perpetual futures across some of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges. The data provides insight into how traders were positioned recently: Exchange Long % Short % Ratio (Long/Short) Total (Aggregated) 50.7% 49.3% ~1.03 Binance 50.25% 49.75% ~1.01 OKX 51.38% 48.62% ~1.06 Bybit 50.05% 49.95% ~1.00 As you can see, the aggregated ratio is very close to 50/50, with a slight lean towards long positions (50.7% long vs 49.3% short). This indicates that, overall, the market sentiment on perpetual futures across these major platforms was quite balanced over the past day. Exchange Breakdown: Subtle Differences in Crypto Trading Sentiment While the overall picture shows balance, there are subtle differences between exchanges: Binance: With 50.25% long and 49.75% short, Binance’s ratio is almost perfectly balanced, reflecting a neutral sentiment among its futures traders. OKX: Showing 51.38% long and 48.62% short, OKX traders exhibited a slightly stronger bullish bias compared to the others. This small difference could sometimes indicate varying trader demographics or strategies on different platforms. Bybit: At 50.05% long and 49.95% short, Bybit’s ratio is the closest to 50/50, suggesting its perpetual futures market was the most evenly split in terms of positioning. These minor variations highlight that sentiment isn’t uniform across all platforms, though in this instance, the overall picture is one of equilibrium in the crypto trading landscape for Bitcoin futures. Actionable Insights for Traders How can a trader use this long short ratio data? Here are a few actionable insights: Confirming Bias: If you have a bullish bias based on other analysis, seeing a slightly positive long-short ratio (like on OKX) might offer mild confirmation of prevailing sentiment. However, never rely on this alone. Identifying Extremes: While not extreme in this dataset, learning to spot excessively high or low ratios on specific exchanges can alert you to potentially overcrowded trades that might be vulnerable to swift reversals. Contextualizing Funding Rates: The long-short ratio is often correlated with funding rates on perpetual futures. Positive funding rates usually occur when the long-short ratio is skewed heavily towards longs, as longs pay shorts to keep the contract price close to the spot price. Balanced ratios often correspond to neutral or low funding rates. Combining with Open Interest: Look at the long-short ratio alongside changes in open interest (the total number of outstanding contracts). If open interest is rising alongside a skewed ratio, it indicates conviction behind the prevailing sentiment. If open interest is falling, positions are being closed, which could signal a potential shift. Challenges and Limitations It’s important to acknowledge the limitations of relying solely on the Bitcoin futures long-short ratio: Backward-Looking: This data reflects positions *already* taken over the past 24 hours. It doesn’t predict future price movements. Data Source: Ratios can be calculated differently or include different sets of traders depending on the exchange or data provider. Retail vs. Institutional: This ratio often aggregates all positions. It doesn’t differentiate between retail traders and potentially larger, more impactful institutional players. Not a Standalone Signal: As mentioned, it’s a sentiment indicator, not a direct buy or sell signal. It must be used in conjunction with price action, volume, open interest, funding rates, and other technical or fundamental analysis. Conclusion: A Balanced Market for Bitcoin Perpetual Futures Based on the 24-hour data, the sentiment among traders in Bitcoin perpetual futures markets appears remarkably balanced across major exchanges like Binance, OKX, and Bybit. The overall long short ratio is very close to 1, suggesting neither extreme bullish nor bearish conviction currently dominates the market positioning. While OKX shows a slightly higher proportion of long positions, the differences are minor. For those involved in crypto trading , this balanced ratio indicates a market potentially in consolidation or awaiting a clearer catalyst. Smart traders will use this information as one piece of the puzzle, combining it with other on-chain and technical indicators to form a comprehensive trading strategy.

Two Chart Patterns Mirror BTC's Rally to $109K,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/07/massive-bitcoin-bull-run-ahead-two-chart-patterns-mirror-btc-s-rally-to-usd109k,"This is a daily technical analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole. Crypto bears might want to closely watch bitcoin’s (BTC) recent chart patterns, which mirror those that preceded the late 2024 rally from $70,000 to $109,000. The first pattern involves the weekly chart’s Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) histogram, a momentum indicator used to identify trend changes and reversals. MACD crossovers above or below the zero line typically signal bullish or bearish shifts in momentum. However, traders interpret these signals in context with price action. A bearish crossover, for example, needs validation through weakening prices; otherwise, it could indicate underlying strength and a bear trap. Currently, that seems to be the case in BTC. The cryptocurrency initially fell after the MACD flipped negative in mid-February, but quickly found support at the 50-week simple moving average (SMA) in March and has since bounced back above $ 90k. All the while, the MACD has held below zero. This pattern is reminiscent of last August and September, when prices held the SMA support amid persistent bearish MACD signals. The indicator flipped bullish around mid-October, confirming the trend with a rally from $70K to $100K by December. The second pattern involves the 50- and 200-day SMAs. About four weeks ago, these averages formed a bearish crossover—commonly known as the death cross—signaling a potential long-term downtrend. However, this turned out to be a bear trap, with bitcoin finding support around $75K and reversing course. Recently, the 50-day SMA has begun to rise again and could soon cross above the 200-day SMA, setting up a bullish golden cross in the coming weeks. This pattern closely mirrors last year’s trend: the death cross in August marked a bottom, quickly followed by a golden cross that sparked a breakout above $70K and ultimately led to a rally above $109K to new highs. In other words, bullish volatility could be on the horizon, potentially taking bitcoin well past the January high of $109K. Chart patterns are commonly used to assess market strength and forecast future movements. However, it’s important to remember that history doesn’t always repeat itself, and macroeconomic factors can rapidly swing market directions, making chart analysis far from foolproof.",Markets|Bitcoin|Technical Analysis|market analysis|News,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-07 11:42:11

In a new CNBC interview, Ives says the market cap of Palantir Technologies could skyrocket by around 290% from the current level in a few years. “I believe this is going to $1 trillion market cap in the next two to three years. These numbers just show, I think, ‘Let’s get to popcorn out.’ It’s still in the early days of playing out.” As of Monday’s market close, Palantir Technologies is trading at $108 and has a market cap of approximately $256 billion. While likening Palantir Technologies to soccer superstar Lionel Messi, Ives defends the software analytics firm’s valuation, saying it is justified given the growth opportunities. “If you go back the last few years, I mean they hated it at $10, despised it at $100 and that would be the continued argument of valuation. If you look at what’s happened to the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, $2 trillion of spend over the next three years. On the software side, it’s their world, everyone else is paying rent, income is to Palantir. So my view is if you look at just on valuation, and if you went back, you’ve missed every transformational tech stock in the last 20 years. If you just focused on valuation, where is this in the next two, three, four or five years? And I view what [CEO Alex] Karp’s doing at Palantir is generational. But again, the haters are going to hate, I get it. Valuation. Check the box. You look at these numbers, to me, I think this is just another sort of table-pounder moment, you know, for what I view as the Messi of AI, Palantir.” Billionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel owns about 4.5% of Palantir Technologies, according to financial data firm Fintel.

This comes a few months after the former CEO denied reports of a deal with President Trump’s family that would see him get pardoned. At the time, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) had claimed that the Trump family wanted to buy a stake in Binance.US in exchange for granting Zhao a pardon . However, the ex-CEO denied this on X, noting that there have been no such meetings and that the report is just a fabrication. Interestingly, he acknowledged in his X post that he would not mind being pardoned by the US government, noting that he is the only person sentenced to prison for a single Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) charge. It appears that Zhao has now initiated efforts to get the presidential pardon. In a conversation on the crypto podcast Rug Radio , he said the application was submitted about two weeks ago, referencing how other crypto personalities, including Bitmex CEO Arthur Hayes, have been pardoned. However, he clarified that he only decided to apply after the Bloomberg and WSJ article came out. According to him, he is still very interested in getting a pardon and will go through the legal process of applying for one. Zhao doubled down on his criticisms of the traditional media’s portrayal of the crypto industry. He noted that there have been false and fabricated reports from mainstream media and warned that such actions will continue to hurt their reputation. CZ raises concerns about memecoins Meanwhile, the former Binance CEO noted that there is too much money in memecoins, and the market is paying too much attention to them. This was in response to the question of what the potential rot in the crypto ecosystem could be at the moment. According to him, most memecoins fail due to their risk and short-term nature. Thus, they are not valuable enough for the interest they get. However, Zhao added that most memecoin traders already know and accept these risks of failure. This view aligns with many who have been critical of memecoins and believe it has caused more damage to the crypto space. Interestingly, the interest in memecoins has plateaued due to the market downturn and the crash in the value of most memecoins. Still, Zhao admitted that memecoins are taking attention from utility projects. He blamed this on the previous Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) stance, which saw most crypto projects as securities. With the new SEC administration deregulating the market and allowing them to take risks again, Zhao expects builders to return to the crypto space. Zhao praises Trump’s pro-crypto moves Interestingly, the former Binance CEO disclosed that he had never spoken with Trump. He explained that Binance is a foreign company, which means it cannot donate to any political campaign, and he personally avoids getting involved in elections. However, he praised the achievements of the Trump administration in the crypto industry. According to him, the idea that the US would see a 180-degree shift in its approach to the industry would have been unimaginable years ago, but it is now achievable due to the power of democracy. He said: “We as an industry are very lucky that the current US president is very pro-crypto, and he is very smart.” Still, he stated that Binance.US does not have any major plans in the US yet, even though it continues to operate. Zhao mentioned that he is the majority shareholder in Binance.US, and the exchange equity arrangement has not changed. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

According to data compiled by blockchain security firm PeckShieldAlert, the month saw substantial crypto losses impacting various protocols and platforms. This period serves as a stark reminder of the persistent security risks within the decentralized ecosystem. Understanding the Scale of April 2025 Crypto Losses April 2025 was a particularly difficult month for digital asset security . Reports indicate that 18 major security incidents led to a staggering total loss exceeding $357 million. This figure highlights the financial impact these breaches have on projects and individual investors alike. While the decentralized nature of blockchain offers many benefits, it also presents unique challenges for maintaining robust blockchain security against determined attackers. Here’s a quick breakdown of the April 2025 security landscape: Total Incidents: 18 major hacks Total Reported Losses: Approximately $357.11 million Impacted Areas: Various protocols, DeFi platforms, and potentially centralized exchanges These numbers underscore the critical need for continuous vigilance and improved security practices across the entire crypto industry. Which Projects Were Affected by Recent Crypto Hacks? While specific details of all 18 incidents are complex and varied, reports mentioned notable cases involving ZKsync, KiloEx, and Term Labs. These incidents, though contributing to the overall loss figure, also saw some positive developments in terms of asset recovery. Interestingly, despite the significant overall losses, some of the stolen assets were successfully recovered. ZKsync, KiloEx, and Term Labs were collectively able to recover approximately $14.4 million worth of the stolen funds. This demonstrates that while breaches are a reality, collaborative efforts and swift action can sometimes mitigate the full impact of crypto losses . Why Do Crypto Hacks Continue to Occur? The persistence of crypto hacks is often attributed to a combination of factors: Smart Contract Vulnerabilities: Flaws in the code that governs decentralized applications can be exploited by attackers. Rigorous auditing is crucial but not always sufficient. Protocol Design Flaws: Sometimes the fundamental economic or technical design of a protocol can create attack vectors. User Error & Phishing: Individuals losing private keys or falling victim to scams remains a significant entry point for attackers. Centralized Points of Failure: Despite the decentralized ethos, many services (like some bridges or exchanges) have centralized components that can be targeted. Lack of Audits or Insufficient Audits: Projects launching without thorough security reviews are high-risk targets. Addressing these root causes is essential for improving overall crypto security and reducing future incidents. What is the Impact of Significant Crypto Losses? The financial impact of crypto losses extends far beyond the immediate value stolen. These incidents can: Erode trust in specific projects and the broader crypto ecosystem. Cause significant financial hardship for individual investors. Lead to decreased liquidity and trading volume for affected tokens. Attract negative regulatory attention. Discourage mainstream adoption. Maintaining robust blockchain security is not just about protecting funds; it’s about fostering a secure and trustworthy environment for innovation and investment. Enhancing Digital Asset Security: Actionable Steps Improving digital asset security requires a multi-pronged approach involving developers, platforms, and users. Here are some actionable insights: For Projects and Developers: Prioritize Security Audits: Engage reputable security firms for comprehensive code audits before and after deployment. Implement Bug Bounty Programs: Incentivize white-hat hackers to find and report vulnerabilities. Use Multi-Signature Wallets: For treasury management and critical operations, require multiple keys to authorize transactions. Adopt Formal Verification: Use mathematical methods to prove the correctness of smart contract code. Plan for Incident Response: Have a clear plan in place for how to react if a security breach occurs, including communication and potential recovery strategies. For Users and Investors: Use Hardware Wallets: Store private keys offline on hardware devices for maximum security. Be Wary of Phishing Attacks: Always double-check URLs and never share your private key or seed phrase. Research Projects Thoroughly: Before investing, look into a project’s security practices, audit history, and team reputation. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Use 2FA on all exchanges and platforms. Be Cautious with Approvals: Understand what permissions you are granting when interacting with dApps. Revoke unnecessary approvals regularly. Conclusion: Navigating the Security Challenges in Crypto April 2025’s significant crypto losses serve as a potent reminder that the journey in the digital asset space comes with inherent risks. While the innovation continues at a rapid pace, security must remain at the forefront. The $357.11 million lost highlights the scale of the challenge, but the $14.4 million recovered by projects like ZKsync, KiloEx, and Term Labs offers a glimmer of hope and underscores the importance of swift, coordinated responses. Improving blockchain security requires a collective effort from developers building protocols to users managing their assets. By prioritizing security audits, adopting best practices, and staying informed about potential threats, the community can work towards building a more secure and resilient future for digital assets. The incidents of April 2025 are not just statistics; they are calls to action for everyone involved in the crypto world to elevate their security posture.

Interest in the TRUMP token shot up over 50% after Trump promised the “gala dinner,” which pushed the token’s market cap to a peak of $2.7 billion, and has since cooled down to $2.18 billion. 762K Wallets Lose, 58 Whales Make $1.1 Billion According to a latest CNBC report, Data from Chainalysis shows that around 762,000 wallets that bought the $TRUMP memecoin suffered losses and are currently in the red. Most of these wallets held smaller amounts of the token. The profits were mostly enjoyed by a few early whales as they grabbed the lion’s share. 58 lucky wallets managed to gain over $10 million each, totaling roughly $1.1 billion in profits. Since that rally, about 54,000 more wallets have bought the coin, bringing the total to 100,000 new wallets since April.

The billionaire get richer and the average American gets… pic.twitter.com/I9bPGNTtXf — Brian Krassenstein (@krassenstein) May 6, 2025 The dinner hype is driving big moves , as a newly created wallet withdrew 1M $TRUMP ($10.78M) from Binance, while @MemeCore_ORG pulled out 1.39M $TRUMP ($17.8M) for the event, now facing a $2.8M loss. Conflicts Of Interest However, the Trump-branded memecoin and a related crypto venture, World Liberty Financial, are facing heat from regulators and ethics watchdogs over possible conflicts of interest. The Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations has now launched a probe into the token’s ownership and how it makes money. It mainly centers around the dinner contest, promotional posts from President Trump, and links to foreign investors like a state-backed Emirati fund and Justin Sun. President Trump and his allies reportedly made nearly $900,000 in trading fees over just two days after announcing the exclusive dinner. Besides, Trump is also holding a $1.5 million per-person “Crypto & AI Innovators” dinner through his super PAC. But there is no requirement to reveal who is buying into the event, which has sparked concerns. Crypto transactions are not publicly disclosed like political donations, which has raised fears of hidden influence from anonymous or foreign backers.",News|Crypto news|Meme Coins,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-07 11:55:58

For regions like Asia, where digital payments and cross-border transactions are booming, the need for reliable, stable digital currencies is paramount. This is precisely why the recent announcement from the Kaia Foundation regarding the integration of USDT onto the Kaia Network is generating significant buzz. This move is not just a technical upgrade; it’s a strategic step aimed squarely at accelerating Stablecoin Adoption across the diverse markets of Asia. Kaia Network’s Strategic Move: Integrating USDT The announcement, shared via the Kaia Foundation’s official Medium blog, confirms that the popular and widely-used stablecoin, Tether (USDT), is now supported on the Kaia Network . This integration is a major milestone for Kaia, a Layer 1 blockchain platform designed with mass adoption in mind, particularly focusing on the Asian market. USDT is the largest stablecoin by market capitalization and transaction volume, known for its deep liquidity and widespread acceptance across numerous exchanges and platforms globally. By bringing USDT onto its chain, Kaia is immediately tapping into a massive pool of potential users and capital. This integration simplifies access to a stable store of value and medium of exchange for individuals and businesses operating within the Kaia ecosystem, directly addressing a key requirement for fostering broader Crypto Adoption in the region. Think of it like building a new highway and immediately connecting it to the busiest financial hubs. That’s essentially what integrating USDT does for the Kaia Network – it connects it to a major artery of the crypto economy, facilitating smoother and faster movement of value. What Does USDT Integration Mean for Stablecoin Adoption in Asia? The inclusion of USDT on Kaia has profound implications for the growth of stablecoins across Asia. Here’s a look at some key areas: Increased Accessibility: Many users in Asia are already familiar with and use USDT on other networks. Its presence on Kaia makes it easier for them to transition or participate in the Kaia ecosystem without needing to acquire different stablecoins. Enhanced Liquidity: USDT brings significant liquidity, which is crucial for decentralized applications (dApps), especially in DeFi. More liquidity means better trading conditions, more robust lending/borrowing protocols, and a healthier overall ecosystem. Facilitating Payments and Remittances: Stablecoins like USDT are ideal for cross-border transactions due to their stable value compared to volatile cryptocurrencies. The integration on Kaia can potentially lower costs and increase the speed of remittances and payments within and across Asian countries. Boosting Developer Activity: Developers building on Kaia now have access to a highly liquid and trusted stablecoin. This opens up possibilities for creating a wider range of dApps, from payment solutions and trading platforms to innovative DeFi protocols tailored for the Asian market. This move is a clear signal that Kaia is serious about providing the necessary infrastructure for real-world use cases of Blockchain Technology in Asia. Exploring the Benefits on the Kaia Network Let’s break down the tangible benefits that users and developers can expect on the Kaia Network now that USDT is supported: Benefit Area Description Impact on Users/Developers Improved DeFi Opportunities USDT’s liquidity enables more efficient trading pairs, lending pools, and yield farming opportunities on Kaia-based decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and DeFi protocols. Users gain access to more diverse and potentially profitable financial activities. Developers have a fundamental building block for sophisticated financial dApps. Simplified Transactions Using a stablecoin like USDT on Kaia makes everyday transactions, payments, and value transfers predictable and less susceptible to crypto market volatility. Easier for users to buy goods/services or send money using crypto without worrying about price swings during the transaction. Attracting New Users Many people entering the crypto space, especially in emerging markets, often start with stablecoins. USDT’s presence lowers the barrier to entry for new users on Kaia. Expands the potential user base for the Kaia Network and its dApps. Enhanced Interoperability As a widely adopted stablecoin, USDT integration can pave the way for easier connections and value transfer between the Kaia Network and other blockchains or platforms where USDT is prominent. Facilitates a more connected and liquid crypto ecosystem for Kaia users. These benefits collectively contribute to making the Kaia Network a more attractive and functional platform for a wide range of activities, pushing forward Stablecoin Adoption in practical ways. Navigating Challenges in the Crypto Asia Landscape While the integration is a significant step forward, it’s important to acknowledge the landscape of Crypto Asia comes with its own set of challenges: Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory environment for stablecoins and cryptocurrencies varies significantly across Asian countries and is constantly evolving. Kaia and its users must navigate these complex and sometimes unpredictable legal frameworks. Competition: The Asian market is a hotbed for blockchain innovation, with many networks vying for user and developer attention. Kaia needs to differentiate itself and demonstrate the unique advantages of its platform, especially with USDT support. User Education: Despite growing interest, understanding stablecoins and blockchain technology still requires education. Onboarding new users and ensuring they understand how to safely use USDT on Kaia is crucial. Infrastructure Development: While digital penetration is high, reliable internet access and smartphone ownership vary across the region. Ensuring the Kaia Network and its dApps are accessible and performant for a diverse user base is key. Successfully addressing these challenges will be critical for Kaia to fully capitalize on the potential offered by the USDT integration and truly accelerate Stablecoin Adoption . The Future of Blockchain Technology with USDT on Kaia The integration of USDT is more than just adding a token; it’s about building a foundation for future growth and utility on the Kaia Network . This move positions Kaia as a key player in the Asian blockchain space, ready to support a wide array of applications that require stable value. The potential impact on Blockchain Technology development in Asia is substantial. With a reliable stablecoin like USDT readily available, developers can focus on building innovative solutions for real-world problems, from supply chain finance and digital identity to gaming economies and social impact projects, all powered by the speed and efficiency of the Kaia Network. The focus on Crypto Asia is strategic. The region is home to a vast population, rapidly growing economies, and a strong inclination towards mobile-first digital services. Providing a stable, accessible digital currency like USDT on a platform designed for this market could unlock unprecedented levels of adoption. Actionable Insights for Readers: For Users: Explore wallets and platforms that support the Kaia Network and USDT. Understand the benefits of using stablecoins for transactions and potential dApp interactions on Kaia. Always prioritize security. For Developers: Consider building dApps on the Kaia Network leveraging USDT’s liquidity and stability. Look into use cases like payments, remittances, or DeFi tailored for the Asian market. For Observers/Investors: Keep an eye on the Kaia Network’s ecosystem growth, particularly the volume and types of transactions involving USDT. Monitor regulatory developments in key Asian markets. Conclusion The integration of USDT onto the Kaia Network marks a pivotal moment in the pursuit of widespread Stablecoin Adoption across Asia. By bringing the world’s most liquid stablecoin to a platform specifically designed for the region, Kaia is laying the groundwork for enhanced accessibility, liquidity, and utility within its ecosystem. While challenges remain, the potential for this integration to fuel innovation, facilitate real-world transactions, and accelerate the adoption of Blockchain Technology in one of the world’s most dynamic markets is undeniable. This move is a significant step forward, promising to unlock new opportunities for users and developers alike in the vibrant landscape of Crypto Asia .

Binance founder Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao predicts that Bitcoin will reach between $500,000 and $1 million this market cycle due to increasing institutional adoption, growing government accumulation, and a pro-crypto U.S policy.

In a May 5 interview with Rug Radio, Zhao stated that he believes Bitcoin will hit $1 million during this market cycle. Additionally, he emphasized how Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) contributed to this increase.

Since then, the XRP price has seen various rallies and declines, with its current value standing around $0.52. Analysts on X have noted that the XRP price is showing signs of strength after bouncing off its $0.47 support. It’s back above the 50-day moving average, a technical setup that historically has preceded sharp upward moves. While the XRP price rally isn’t confirmed yet, the legendary crypto trader now sees an identical structure forming for FloppyPepe (FPPE), just as it did for XRP in 2017. History Repeating? XRP’s 2017 Pattern Mirrors What’s Happening With FloppyPepe (FPPE) A famous crypto trader pointed out that both the XRP price and FloppyPepe (FPPE) showcased low initial consolidation followed by a community-driven volume spike. This AI token’s presale, now priced at a mere $0.0000002, reflects this pattern as over $907,200 was raised in its private round within 24 hours. Like XRP in its infancy, it isn’t gaining traction solely from speculation but from a surge in market interest, community activity, and technological deployment. Why Top Crypto Trader Believes In FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) Viral Explosion While others struggle with real-world relevance, FloppyPepe (FPPE) offers a feature-rich stack: the FloppyX AI-Agent, Meme-o-Matic platform, and FloppyAI which is ready for try-outs at floppypepe.ai .

Accompanied by a message emphasizing preparedness and foresight, Time Traveler’s proclamation has ignited discussions across the crypto community, challenging prevailing market analyses and investor expectations. I want you to remember my face. I want you to know who told you what was coming. I want you to know who you should have listened to. I'm not scared for you to know my face. I will have Navy Seals patrolling my property in the mountains. 73k XRP is coming. pic.twitter.com/Mu2BUfV4zB — Time Traveler (@Traveler2236) May 7, 2025 Current Market Landscape and Analyst Projections As of report time, 2025, XRP is trading at approximately $2.14, with recent fluctuations between $2.09 and $2.17. This positions Time Traveler’s prediction as a monumental leap, suggesting a price increase exceeding 3,400,000%. In contrast, established financial analyses present more conservative forecasts. For instance, All Things XRP’s recent report outlines a bullish scenario where XRP could reach up to $10, $15, and $30, influenced by macroeconomic conditions and institutional adoption. Further projections by Bitwise, a $12 billion asset manager, provide a detailed outlook for XRP’s potential value through 2030. Their analysis considers various factors, including regulatory developments and market adoption, to estimate XRP’s growth trajectory. The Vision Behind the Prediction Time Traveler’s assertion is not merely a numerical forecast but a call to awareness and action. By stating, “I want you to remember my face… I will have Navy Seals patrolling my property in the mountains,” Time Traveler emphasizes a narrative of preparedness and insider knowledge. This approach resonates with a segment of the crypto community that values bold predictions and the idea of being ahead of mainstream financial movements. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Sentiment and Community Reactions The crypto community’s response to such a bold prediction is mixed. While some view it as an inspiring vision that challenges conventional thinking, others approach it with skepticism, citing the lack of empirical data supporting such exponential growth. Notably, previous optimistic forecasts, such as analyst Javon Marks’ suggestion of XRP reaching $99, have been met with cautious optimism, emphasizing the importance of market fundamentals and adoption rates. Time Traveler’s $73,000 XRP prediction stands as a provocative statement in the cryptocurrency discourse, pushing the boundaries of traditional market analysis. While current data and expert forecasts suggest more modest growth for XRP, such bold predictions fuel discussions about the potential and future of digital assets. As the market evolves, investors and enthusiasts alike will continue to weigh visionary forecasts against empirical evidence, shaping the narrative of cryptocurrency’s role in the global financial landscape.

The proposal , published on May 6 on the WLFI governance forum, outlines a plan to test WLFI’s smart contract-based airdrop mechanism in a live environment. The idea is simple: distribute a small, yet-to-be-finalized amount of USD1 stablecoin to WLFI token holders who qualify based on an internal snapshot. But beyond a gesture of gratitude, the firm says the trial is a critical step in validating the technical underpinnings of its distribution infrastructure. “Testing the airdrop mechanism in a live setting is a necessary step to ensure smart contract functionality and readiness,” the proposal reads. “This distribution also serves as a meaningful way to thank our earliest supporters and introduce them to USD1.” The vote is open until May 14, but it’s already clear where sentiment lies—an overwhelming 99.97% of the 2.6 billion votes cast so far support the move. Only a minuscule 0.03% have voted against it. While no specific airdrop date has been confirmed, the proposal notes that WLFI retains the right to suspend or cancel the test at any point, adding a layer of flexibility in what appears to be a closely monitored rollout. Stablecoin Momentum and Global Currency Shifts WLFI’s stablecoin ambitions come at a time of explosive growth in the broader dollar-denominated stablecoin market , which surged past a $230 billion market cap in April, per Citigroup data. Dominated by Tether (USDT) and USDC, the space remains heavily USD-centric—but that’s beginning to shift. Other nations are entering the fray with their own fiat-backed digital assets. A bu Dhabi recently announced plans for a dirham-pegged stablecoin, while a Russian finance ministry official suggested a ruble-backed token as a potential workaround after the U.S. froze wallets linked to sanctioned Russian entities. Political Backing Fuel WLFI Rise Since launching in September, WLFI has conducted two successful public sales, raising $550 million across 85,000 registered token holders. With the Trump family’s name reportedly behind it , the project is drawing both investor attention and political intrigue as it navigates the volatile world of digital finance. Whether USD1 takes off as a viable competitor remains to be seen, but the upcoming airdrop is likely to serve as an early litmus test.

TeraWulf's asset-light approach to HPC hosting, avoiding GPU CapEx and market risks, positions it as a flexible and attractive infrastructure partner. The company's financial flexibility has improved, with significant debt repayment and new funding. Institutional interest is growing, with BlackRock increasing its stake, highlighting TeraWulf's potential in the evolving HPC and Bitcoin mining sectors. TeraWulf’s ( WULF ) Q1 earnings report is scheduled for 8:00 AM EST today (May 7). This article will cover the earnings preview and expectations from the earnings call, as well as the outlook for the fiscal year with anticipated updates from WULF Compute, the miner’s HPC hosting segment, and WULF Mining. TeraWulf has become a well-recognized company in the Bitcoin mining business, and is advancing its ESG goals with reduced emissions in Bitcoin mining. Since capitalizing on utilizing computing and energy infrastructure for high-performance computing (HPC) hosting for AI hyperscaling, TeraWulf is becoming a household name in “hybrid mining” - a term for miners focused on both Bitcoin mining and HPC hosting. Hybrid mining has now become an important term in crypto mining. Over the years, miners often wasted valuable energy and underutilized their computing power, which has mostly led to very compressed margins, especially during bear cycles. The use of energy and computing power for HPC hosting is a potential remedy, though it comes with higher CapEx and potential execution risks - the “DeepSeek scare” is a reminder of the stakes involved in HPC hosting for AI hyperscaling. But from a generic view, diversification into HPC hosting can potentially yield better margins for miners down the line, especially in a BTC uptrend. In the past, I wasn’t a fan of WULF because its business lacked a focused strategy. Its mining business had become a single-track operation; hence, I didn't cover the stock here on Seeking Alpha. While TeraWulf ended 2023 on a solid operational note, ending 2023 with 7.9 EH/s, up from just 1.4 EH/s in 2022, I felt the management didn't yet communicate a dominant strategy at that time, the way other miners were pitching their strategy to investors. For HUT 8 Corp. ( HUT ), it was HPC computing, for MARA Holdings ( MARA ), it was vertical integration through proprietary cooling solutions and mining hardware. Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) had a clear strategy with the demand response program with ERCOT, sometimes even making more money from power credits than Bitcoin itself. This created a unique edge in Bitcoin market downturns. This was the type of diversified strategy that TeraWulf lacked then. What’s dangerous is not to evolve. — Jeff Bezos TeraWulf, however, turned the corner in 2024 and showed the maturity to navigate the operational and financial labyrinth of the crypto mining business. The company has scaled and evolved rapidly in the past year, and now stands better positioned than ever for the 2025 fiscal year. Focus on HPC has brought the strategic clarity that was once lacking. And the fact that it is formalizing this into its own subsidiary, WULF Compute, means the company is no longer just experimenting. TeraWulf has quietly built an impressive track record of efficient scaling. Previous mining capacity targets of 10.5 EH/s by 2024 were nearly fully realized at the end of Q4 last year, only missing the target by 0.8 EH/s, having ended 2024 at 9.7 EH/s capacity. Hosting capacity at the Lake Mariner facility almost doubled in 2024 to 195 MW, from 110 MW at the beginning of the year. I believe TeraWulf is now at the ""right place at the right time"" in HPC hosting. Among the miners, TeraWulf can be considered a late bird in HPC hosting. I believe this has allowed TeraWulf to craft a better strategy for the WULF Compute business line. Sometimes it’s the ones who come late to the party that leave with the best gains, after watching the early guests spill their drinks. In its HPC approach, TeraWulf is avoiding the operational complexity that purchasing and maintaining GPUs for HPC hosting presents, and will be focusing on providing infrastructure to HPC clients – power, cooling, rack, and space – as the management has iterated. TeraWulf’s HPC hosting is basically: bring your GPUs and we’ll host them. Let’s pause and ask ourselves how the HIVE Digital ( HIVE:CA ) heavy CapEx on purchasing Nvidia ( NVDA ) GPUs since 2021 has been going so far. For context, HIVE reported $2.5 million from its HPC business in its Q3 FY25 report and is now looking at a $10 million annual run rate. Let's not forget the $66 million investment in GPU purchases in 2021. The latest HIVE Nvidia GPU purchases were in December last year and were worth $30 million. At the time of the latest purchase, HIVE projected $15 million in annualized revenue from the H100 GPUs by the end of 2024, and over $20 million in revenue from the H200 GPUs by Q2 2025. The $10 million revised annual run rate is a stark underperformance from the initial projections and suggests underutilization of the GPUs so far. TeraWulf’s asset-light approach to HPC hosting should be the company’s main highlight to most investors. I like the fact that TeraWulf isn’t taking on the GPU CapEx and market risks. GPUs are highly depreciable assets compared to assets like electricity, cooling, and racks, which typically see much longer shelf lives. For a company that already faces balance sheet constraints from the Bitcoin mining business and volatile Bitcoin price, the asset-light approach is a good move. And I believe in the coming years, AI GPUs will see faster depreciation compared to Bitcoin mining machines because of the type of competition in AI chip development currently. AI is in an “arms race” phase with a very short tech cycle. At least, Bitcoin miners mostly have to worry about mining machine obsolescence, mainly at Bitcoin halving, around every four years. Even though the mining machines become less efficient over time, their depreciation will be slower compared to AI GPUs. TeraWulf’s balance sheet was only deleveraged last year with the full payment of the legacy loan term debt of $139.4 million. Prudence in execution is an absolute necessity moving forward, and thus makes the HPC execution strategy a must-watch for investors. TeraWulf now stands in a more flexible financial position, with funding generated from the $500 convertible note last year and $75 million obtained from the sale of their 25% equity interest in the Nautilus facility. The fact that the company’s strategy focuses on scalable infrastructure to attract longer-term HPC contracts for longer-term value creation is an underrated edge if you hold WULF in your portfolio. In the Q1 results, I expect clearly stipulated revenue guidance and highlights from the Core42 HPC deal and a progress report on the already-funded 72.5 MW of HPC hosting capacity set for delivery this year. Since TeraWulf doesn’t compete with Core42 in GPU ownership, the deal structure gives Core24 the flexibility to bring their own GPU and scale and upgrade in a vertically integrated workflow. This positions TeraWulf as a neutral, value-add infrastructure partner and makes the structure attractive for long-term hosting deals. Takeaway I'm maintaining a Hold stance with this coverage, which is my initiating coverage of WULF with no price targets yet. The Q1 earnings result later this week has a lot to clarify for WULF in the near and long term. Fintel WULF’s business approach is starting to attract the right attention. Institutional interest is growing. BlackRock has increased its position on WULF by over 100% year-over-year and now holds about 5.4% of WULF common shares. TeraWulf's entry into HPC is based on an approach that minimizes capital and market risks. This approach makes WULF a Bitcoin miner worth being on the watch list. In a sector where timing and strategy are everything, TeraWulf may have just found its sweet spot in HPC.",HUT|MARA|RIOT|HIVE|HIVE:CA|HUT:CA|WULF,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-05-07 12:08:26

The growing adoption rate of the XRP Ledger Protocol could push XRP to $9.83, with a possible maximum trading value of $10.48 in 2028. In 2031, the target price for XRP is between $15.72 and $17.03, with an average price of $16.38. XRP has a strong community of supporters and developers and continues to see tremendous potential in Ripple’s technology and products. Despite short-term price fluctuations and a bear market, many analysts believe XRP has a bright future. Whether it will reach new highs or continue to grow steadily remains to be seen, but this crypto asset will undoubtedly play an important role in global financial institutions. So, how high can XRP realistically go? Will XRP reach 5 dollars? Let’s answer these questions in our XRP price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Ripple Token XRP Price $ 2.138 Market Cap $125.33B Trading Volume $2.25B Circulating Supply 58.5B XRP All-time High $3.40 Jan 07, 2018 All-time Low $0.002802 July 07, 2014 24-hour High $2.17 24-hour Low $2.08 XRP price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 5.26% 50-Day SMA $ 2.20 200-Day SMA $ 1.906492 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed 67 (Greed) Green Days 12/30 (40%) XRP price analysis: XRP devalues to $2.138 as bears take charge XRP price analysis confirmed a downtrend at $2.138. Cryptocurrency lost up to 0.80% of its value. XRP coin prices seek a support level at $2.052. On May 7, 2025, XRP price analysis revealed a declining trend in the market. The altcoin price has dropped down to $2.138 over the past 24 hours. Concurrently, the currency lost a noticeable 0.80% of its worth. This creates unfavorable circumstances for the investors, as the bears are back on track. XRP price analysis on the daily timeframe The one-day price chart of XRP coin confirmed a downward trend for the currency. The altcoin value has depreciated to $2.138 in the last 24 hours. The declining volatility hints at a lower chance of an upcoming reversal. The distance between the Bollinger bands defines the volatility. This distance is converging, leading to a receding volatility. Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance, has shifted to $2.296. Conversely, its lower limit, serving as the support, has moved to $2.052. XRP shows decreasing volatility: XRPUSDT Chart The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is present within the neutral region. The indicator’s value has decreased to index 47.02 in the past 24 hours. This decline reflects a rising selling pressure in the market. If the bearish momentum continues to grow, further downside is possible soon. XRP price analysis on the 4-hour chart The four-hour price analysis of XRP coin referred to a strong bearish trend. The XRP/USD value has been reduced to $2.139 over the span of the last four hours. Red candlesticks on the price chart reflect a rising selling activity. The Bollinger Bands are converging, leading to a declining volatility. This decline signals a relatively lower market unpredictability for the day. Moving ahead, the upper Bollinger Band is now present at $2.209, indicating the resistance threshold. Whereby, the lower Bollinger band is situated at $2.085, securing the support point. XRP/USD 4-hour price chart The RSI indicator is situated within the neutral area. The indicator’s value has depreciated to index 45.48 in the past few hours. This decline is being reflected by a descending RSI slope. The bearish strength remained high in the day, leading to a noticeable instability within the market. XRP technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 2.11 BUY SMA 5 2.21 SELL SMA 10 2.23 SELL SMA 21 2.22 SELL SMA 50 2.20 SELL SMA 100 2.35 SELL SMA 200 1.906492 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 2.14 BUY EMA 5 2.10 BUY EMA 10 2.10 BUY EMA 21 2.16 SELL EMA 50 2.28 SELL EMA 100 2.26 SELL EMA 200 1.956843 BUY What to expect from XRP price analysis? Ripple price analysis gives out a relatively bearish prediction regarding the current market trends. The XRP/USD value has deteriorated to $2.138 in the last 24 hours. From an overall observation, the currency has devalued up to 0.80 percent in the day. If buyers continue to push the price below immediate Fib levels, XRP price might face a retest of the $2 support line. On the other hand, a successful rebound by buyers might strengthen the support channels. In such a case, XRP price might trigger an upward trend toward weekly resistance line of $2.25. Is XRP a good investment? XRP, a cryptocurrency specifically designed for quick and cost-effective cross-border transactions, holds promise in global finance. The easing of regulatory hurdles for Ripple and the rising adoption might boost XRP price. Additionally, several recent acquisition and CBDC development make XRP a good investment option in the long-term. As with any investment, the outlook for XRP remains uncertain, necessitating a cautious approach and thorough due diligence. Why is XRP down? The XRP/USD crypto pair price has decreased as the selling influx was abruptly taken, reducing the price to $2.138 during the day. The RSI decreased up to 47.02 at the same time but remains in neutral territory. How much will XRP cost in 2025? XRP is expected to trade at an average price of $3.28 by the end of 2025. Will XRP reach $5? For XRP to reach $5, its value would need to double. Considering the current bullish trend and XRP’s price action, a surge to $5 by the middle of next year is not entirely out of the question, particularly if demand for XRP tokens continues to rise and its growth trajectory remains consistent. However, it’s crucial to remember that XRP’s all-time high stands at $3.84, achieved on January 7, 2018. Can XRP reach $20? According to Ripple’s price prediction, XRP has a lesser chance of reaching $20 by 2031. However, it is expected to reach this level if the XRP ecosystem adoption by major financial institutions continues, making it a good option to buy XRP. Will XRP reach $100 dollars? Though there are rumors of XRP reaching $100 in the market, and some pro-XRP analysts are also promoting it, many are raising questions about this possibility. XRP may not reach $100 in the near future, at least. Will XRP reach $1000? If one XRP coin is worth $1000, its market cap must be more than $100 trillion. Comparatively, the total global stock market cap is about $110 trillion. Therefore, it is unlikely that XRP will reach $1000, based on current market dynamics. Does XRP have a good long-term future? XRP is expected to increase in value gradually over the coming years, giving good yields to XRP holders and institutional investors. The coin is trading at five times its value from last year, and it is expected to reach the highest price of $17.03 by 2031. This makes it a valuable asset for multiple gains after significant market capitalization with continuous efforts by Ripple Labs. However, regulatory uncertainties still linger with the Ripple lawsuit. Considering these factors, investors must carry out their own research. Recent news/opinions on the Ripple Network ProShares has announced that it has no plans to launch an XRP ETF by May 1st. The firm clarified that any future ETFs will be based on futures contracts. Ripple’s spot XRP ETF has launched in Brazil, but the firm said that there is no ETF for US investors at the moment. Previously, ProShares was set to launch three leveraged and short XRP futures ETFs on April 30 after SEC review. Read more about it here and here .

XRP price prediction May 2025 According to XRP price prediction, in May 2025, XRP could reach a maximum price of $2.57. The average trading price is expected to be $2.14 for the month, while the lowest it can go as per XRP cost estimation is $1.82, considering the current XRP sentiment.

It is important to consider that predictions are not investment advice. Professional consultation is suggested, or you can carry out your research. XRP historic price sentiment Before 2017, the asset’s value hovered around $0.01; in April 2017, it rose to $0.05; the gradual climb soon continued as it reached $0.25 in May, showing a positive price action as Ripple continued to excel. XRP price history Towards the end of 2019, XRP price stabilized at around $0.30 and did not cross the $0.5 mark throughout the year. However, the bullish run of 2020 pushed the coin’s value to a peak price of $0.8, gaining investor interest before finishing the year at $0.66. Early 2021 was supposed to be bullish for XRP, but the SEC announced a lawsuit that derailed investors. Nonetheless, XRP beat the odds and surged above $1.5 during the year, but by 2022, it plummeted significantly to as low as $0.31. XRP started 2023 at $0.335, and on July 13, it almost doubled its value in a steep spike. It shot from $0.470 to $0.814 while swinging towards $0.9 for a few hours. A partial victory against the SEC triggered the price jump, surging the trading volume. XRP closed 2023 at about $0.62. In 2024, XRP has so far ridden the market wave. The bears earlier on and then a bullish price movement by mid-March resulted in a market price of $0.72, according to data from the cryptocurrency market. In July, XRP traded between $0.418 and $0.658, showing a good recovery. However, the coin went under bearish pressure at the start of August, falling back down to the $0.550 range as per crypto market records showing high volatility. In September 2024, XRP recovered up to the $0.642 level, but the price went down to the $0.500 range in October. A tremendous bullish impulse was observed in November when XRP touched the $1.96 mark, and it reached $2.72 on December 2, 2024. In January 2025, XRP reached a peak price of $3.19 and traded near the $2.90 level in February. It stepped down to $2.1 in March and to $1.79 in April. At the start of May, XRP is again trending near the $2.2 range.",Crypto Price Predictions|Ripple|XRP,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|XRP|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-07 12:10:00

As Bitcoin (BTC) navigates its current consolidation phase, staying informed about key market indicators is crucial. One fascinating area to watch is the behavior of different types of investors, particularly the large players often referred to as Bitcoin Whales . Recent data from on-chain analytics platform Santiment highlights a significant divergence in activity that could offer clues about future price movements. Understanding the Players: Bitcoin Whales vs. Retail Investors In the cryptocurrency world, participants are often categorized by the size of their holdings. At one end of the spectrum are Retail Investors , typically holding smaller amounts of crypto. At the other end are the Bitcoin Whales , entities holding substantial quantities of BTC. These large holders can significantly influence market dynamics due to the sheer volume of their transactions. Santiment’s recent report on X brought this dynamic into sharp focus. They observed that wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 BTC have been exhibiting a markedly different behavior compared to smaller holders. The Data Doesn’t Lie: Significant Bitcoin Accumulation According to the on-chain data provided by Santiment, since March 26th, a specific cohort of Bitcoin Whales – those holding between 10 and 10,000 BTC – have collectively added a staggering amount of Bitcoin to their reserves. The precise figure reported is over 81,338 BTC accumulated during this period. To put this in perspective, 81,338 BTC represents a significant portion of the available supply being moved off exchanges or into long-term storage by large players. This steady inflow into whale wallets indicates strong conviction among these holders. Why Are Bitcoin Whales Accumulating? The decision by Bitcoin Whales to engage in such large-scale Bitcoin Accumulation is often interpreted as a bullish signal. Several factors might drive this behavior: Long-Term Conviction: Whales often have a longer investment horizon and may view current price levels as opportune entry or accumulation points before a potential upward move. Anticipation of Future Demand: They might be positioning themselves ahead of anticipated institutional adoption or macroeconomic shifts that could favor Bitcoin. Strategic Positioning: Large holders can sometimes have access to information or analysis that isn’t readily available to the general public, allowing them to make informed decisions. This consistent buying pressure from deep pockets suggests confidence in Bitcoin’s value proposition, even during periods of price stagnation or volatility. What Drives Retail Investors to Sell? In stark contrast to the behavior of whales, Santiment’s data showed that Retail Investors , specifically those holding less than 0.1 BTC, were net sellers during the same timeframe. These smaller holders collectively offloaded around 290 BTC. Why the sell-off from retail? Several common psychological and market factors could be at play: Fear and Uncertainty: Market consolidation or slight price dips can trigger fear (FUD – Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) among less experienced investors, leading them to sell to avoid further losses. Fatigue and Impatience: Sideways price action can lead to frustration. Retail investors with shorter time horizons may sell out of impatience, seeking quicker gains elsewhere. Need for Liquidity: Smaller holders might need to sell for personal financial reasons unrelated to market sentiment. Reacting to News: Retail can be more susceptible to selling based on negative news headlines or social media sentiment. This divergence paints a picture where experienced, larger players are buying into weakness or consolidation, while smaller, potentially more emotionally driven investors are exiting their positions. Decoding On-Chain Data Signals This situation perfectly illustrates the power of On-Chain Data analysis. By examining transactions recorded on the public Bitcoin ledger, platforms like Santiment can provide insights into the behavior of different market participants that are invisible on traditional price charts alone. Key signals from this data include: Accumulation/Distribution: Are coins moving onto exchanges (often seen as preparation for selling) or off exchanges into private wallets (suggesting holding)? Holder Behavior: Analyzing wallet addresses grouped by size (like the 10-10,000 BTC cohort) reveals trends in conviction or capitulation. Supply Dynamics: Tracking the amount of BTC held by different wallet types gives a clearer picture of market structure. The current divergence, where whales are accumulating and retail is distributing, is often historically viewed as a precursor to bullish price movements, as large hands are increasing their stake while potential selling pressure from smaller holders is being absorbed. What This Accumulation Could Mean for Bitcoin Price The significant Bitcoin Accumulation by whales has direct implications for the potential future Bitcoin Price . When large amounts of BTC are moved off exchanges into cold storage or private wallets, it reduces the readily available supply for selling. If demand remains constant or increases while supply on exchanges tightens due to whale accumulation, the stage could be set for a price increase. Whales buying aggressively can also absorb selling pressure, creating a floor under the price during dips. Benefits of Whale Accumulation: Often signals underlying strength and conviction in the asset. Reduces available supply on exchanges, potentially leading to price appreciation if demand rises. Can absorb retail selling pressure, stabilizing the market during downturns. Challenges/Considerations: Whale moves are not the sole determinant of price; macroeconomic factors, regulatory news, and overall market sentiment also play roles. Whales can also sell, and large distribution events can lead to sharp price drops. On-chain data provides insights into supply dynamics and sentiment but doesn’t predict price with certainty. Actionable Insights: Use on-chain data as one tool among many in your analysis. Understand your own investment horizon and risk tolerance; don’t blindly follow large wallets. Focus on the long-term fundamentals of Bitcoin. Conclusion The clear divergence highlighted by Santiment, with Bitcoin Whales significantly increasing their holdings by over 81,000 BTC since late March while Retail Investors net sold, presents a compelling narrative. This robust Bitcoin Accumulation by large players, confirmed by On-Chain Data , is historically seen as a bullish indicator, suggesting confidence in future price appreciation despite the current market consolidation. While not a guarantee, it’s a powerful signal that savvy investors are positioning themselves, potentially paving the way for a positive shift in Bitcoin Price dynamics. Keeping an eye on these underlying trends, rather than just short-term price volatility, is key to navigating the crypto market effectively.

Bitcoin’s more than 32% rally from its lows of $74,000 in early April to around $98,000 has also raised expectations for a rally. However, while BTC's recent decline to $94,000 has caused concern among investors, Bitfinex analysts said that the BTC bull run may not be over yet. Bitfinex noted in its weekly report that Bitcoin has further upside potential if macroeconomic conditions stabilize. Analysts also noted that Bitcoin needs to stay above $95,000 to reach new ATHs. At this point, analysts say that Bitcoin holding above this level would signal a “structural transition” into bullish territory, but warn that failure to hold $95,000 could lead to a deeper correction. Analysts stated that the volatility seen in the short term continues to be worrying, but the picture is optimistic in the medium term, and that $95,000 is critical for new ATHs: “Reclaiming the $95,000 level, which is the lower end of the old three-month range, remains important and critical. Holding the $95,000 zone, especially with BTC consolidating above the short-term conservative cost price of $93,340, could set the stage for a move to new all-time highs. However, failure to hold could turn this level into resistance once again, increasing the risk of a short-term rejection and deep correction.” *This is not investment advice.

Changpeng Zhao, widely known as CZ, the former CEO of Binance, recently stirred excitement in the crypto community with a simple yet impactful suggestion regarding BSC gas fees . Taking to the social media platform X, CZ posed a question to users: should the gas fees on Binance Smart Chain (now part of the broader BNB Chain ) be reduced significantly? His query offered two potential scenarios – a threefold reduction or an even more drastic tenfold cut. This isn’t just a casual comment; coming from a figure as influential as CZ Binance , it signals a potential push towards making the chain even more accessible and cost-effective for millions of users worldwide. Understanding BSC Gas Fees : Why They Matter Before diving into the implications of CZ’s suggestion, let’s clarify what gas fees are and why they are a critical component of blockchain networks like BNB Chain . Think of gas fees as the transaction costs you pay to execute operations on a blockchain. These fees compensate the validators or miners who use their computing power to verify and process transactions, securing the network in the process. On Binance Smart Chain (now BNB Chain ), gas fees are paid in BNB, the native token. Historically, BSC gained popularity partly due to its significantly lower fees compared to Ethereum, especially during periods of high network congestion on Ethereum. These fees are essential for: Incentivizing validators to maintain the network’s security and integrity. Preventing spam attacks by making it economically unfeasible to flood the network with trivial transactions. Allocating network resources efficiently based on demand. The level of BSC gas fees directly impacts the cost of performing various activities on the chain, such as swapping tokens on decentralized exchanges (DEXs), interacting with decentralized applications (dApps), buying and selling NFTs, or simply sending tokens between wallets. CZ Binance ‘s Bold Proposal: A Look at the Numbers The former Binance chief’s suggestion was straightforward: a reduction in the current base gas fee on BNB Chain . His post on X directly asked the community for feedback, presenting options for the magnitude of the cut: CZ’s question was specifically: Should BSC decrease gas fees? 3x or 10x? This isn’t the first time discussions around optimizing fees have surfaced for BNB Chain , but a direct suggestion from CZ Binance carries significant weight and immediately sparks debate and analysis within the ecosystem. A 3x reduction would mean fees become one-third of their current cost, while a 10x reduction would slash them to just one-tenth. Either scenario represents a dramatic decrease. The Potential Impact of Lower BNB Chain Costs Reducing gas fees on BNB Chain could have far-reaching positive effects on its ecosystem and user base. Here are some key benefits: Increased Affordability for Users: The most direct impact is on the end-user. Cheaper fees make small transactions, frequent trading, and extensive interaction with dApps much more economical. This is particularly beneficial for users in regions with lower average incomes or those just starting out in crypto. Boost for dApp Usage: Lower transaction costs reduce the barrier to entry for using various decentralized applications on BNB Chain , including DeFi protocols, gaming dApps, and NFT marketplaces. This could lead to higher user engagement and activity on the network. Enhanced Competitiveness: In the crowded Layer 1 and Layer 2 blockchain space, transaction costs are a major factor users consider. Lowering BSC gas fees would strengthen BNB Chain ‘s position against competitors, potentially attracting users and developers from other networks. More Complex Interactions: Some dApps require multiple on-chain transactions for a single operation. Reducing fees makes these multi-step interactions less costly, enabling more complex and innovative applications to thrive on the chain. While the benefits for users are clear, the implications for validators and the network’s security model would need careful consideration. Comparing Crypto Gas Fees : Where Does BNB Chain Stand? Understanding the context requires comparing BSC gas fees with those on other prominent blockchain networks. Historically, BNB Chain (as BSC) emerged as a popular alternative to Ethereum primarily because of its lower fees and faster transaction times. Here’s a simplified comparison (note: fees fluctuate based on network congestion): Blockchain Network Native Token for Fees Typical Fee Range (approximate, varies greatly) Ethereum (Layer 1) ETH High (can range from a few dollars to hundreds during congestion) BNB Chain (formerly BSC) BNB Low (often less than a dollar, sometimes just cents) Polygon (Layer 2 on Ethereum) MATIC Very Low (cents) Solana SOL Extremely Low (fractions of a cent) Avalanche (C-Chain) AVAX Low to Moderate (cents to a dollar or two) Even before CZ’s suggestion, BNB Chain was competitive on fees. A 3x or 10x reduction would push it towards the very low end of the spectrum, making it one of the cheapest major chains for basic transactions, potentially rivaling networks like Solana or Polygon for certain operations. What are the Challenges of Reducing Blockchain Transaction Fees ? While lower fees are attractive, drastically cutting blockchain transaction fees isn’t without potential drawbacks and challenges that the BNB Chain community and validators would need to address: Validator Incentives: Validators are compensated through gas fees and block rewards. A significant reduction in fees could reduce their revenue, potentially impacting the number of validators or their commitment to securing the network if not offset by other incentives. Increased Spam Risk: Making transactions extremely cheap lowers the cost for malicious actors to spam the network with a large volume of trivial transactions, potentially increasing network load and affecting performance for legitimate users. Economic Model Stability: The fee structure is part of the network’s overall economic model. Any drastic change needs careful analysis to ensure long-term sustainability and security. Potential Centralization Concerns: If only very large validators can remain profitable with lower fees, it could potentially lead to increased centralization, which goes against the core principles of decentralization. Any decision to reduce fees would likely involve a governance proposal and vote by BNB Chain validators and potentially token holders, ensuring community consensus on balancing affordability with network security and stability. Actionable Insights for Users and Developers What does this potential change mean for you? For Users: Keep an eye on official announcements from the BNB Chain core team. If fees are reduced, you’ll immediately benefit from lower costs on swaps, NFT trades, and dApp interactions. This might make it more viable to perform smaller, more frequent transactions. For Developers: Cheaper fees could attract more users to your dApps on BNB Chain . Consider how a lower fee environment might enable new types of applications or user interactions that were previously too costly. This suggestion from CZ Binance highlights the ongoing efforts within major blockchain ecosystems to optimize for user experience and cost-efficiency. Conclusion: A Potential Game Changer for BNB Chain Changpeng Zhao’s suggestion to significantly reduce BSC gas fees , potentially by 3x or even 10x, is a pivotal moment for the BNB Chain ecosystem. Coming from such an influential voice, it immediately puts the spotlight on transaction costs and their impact on user adoption and network activity. While the community and validators will need to carefully weigh the benefits of increased affordability against potential challenges like validator incentives and spam risk, the prospect of drastically lower crypto gas fees on one of the most widely used blockchains is undeniably exciting. Such a move could not only solidify BNB Chain ‘s position as a cost-effective alternative but also potentially onboard more users into the world of decentralized finance and applications, proving that accessibility remains a key driver for blockchain growth.

Reasons Why The $5 Mark Is Back On The Radar For The XRP Price After several weeks of bearish momentum, the crypto market is gradually mirroring a spring bloom once again, and Ripple (XRP) is one of the standout altcoins leading the charge. While the Ripple price itself was trading around lower ranges between $2.15 and $2.33 this past week, current developments have spiked the possibility of it hitting $5 soon. The potential for a surge in the Ripple price was initially amplified with the launch of the Teucrium 2x Long Daily XRP ETF (XXRP) on April 8. With over $5 million in debut trading volume, it ranked among the top 5% ETF launches. While XRP holders saw this as a bullish factor for a Ripple price jump to $5, this was only the beginning. The US SEC formally approved April 30 as the launch date for the ProShares XRP futures ETFs, which further bolstered the Ripple price positivity. Although the launch was later rescheduled for May 14, the positivity allowed Ripple (XRP) to reach a market capitalization above $130 billion. This surge sparked further speculations of the Ripple price surging to $5. Don’t Snooze On FloppyPepe (FPPE)—Act Fast!

But Hougan isn’t convinced it’s enough. Without bipartisan legislation, these advances remain vulnerable to the next political shift. Who Can Derail Crypto? Hougan Answers! Hougan’s blunt answer to what could halt crypto’s growth? “People can derail crypto. More preciously, the Politicians could derail crypto,” he wrote, highlighting the need for bipartisan legislation to lock in progress. His concern is about Congress missing the moment. Despite regulatory rollbacks and favorable appointments, nothing is set in stone without legislative action. A lasting framework is the only way to protect these gains and build long-term confidence, especially among institutional investors. Stablecoin Bill Hits a Wall One bill in particular has captured attention: the GENIUS Act, a stablecoin framework backed earlier by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong. It made surprising headway in March, clearing the Senate Banking Committee with rare bipartisan support. But by early May, momentum collapsed. 9 Senate Democrats pulled their support, citing concerns over anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) measures. Hougan believes this sudden reversal has more to do with political calculations than actual policy flaws. He also cautioned that combining stablecoin regulation with broader market reforms is a risky bet. “This is the perfect example of the enemy of the good,” he noted. Why It Matters for Bitcoin and Altcoins Despite the regulatory roadblocks, Hougan remains firmly bullish on crypto’s future. He’s forecasting fresh all-time highs not only for Bitcoin, but also for Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL). But here’s the catch: without legal clarity – especially around stablecoins and market structure – institutional capital may stay on the sidelines. That means fewer inflows, more volatility, and potentially, a delayed or diluted bull run. One bill could make crypto history. Inaction could make it bleed.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-07 13:27:41

Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-edges-out-bitcoin-liquidations-dominance-in-one-hour-heres-the-significance/,"In a surprising market development, XRP has overtaken Bitcoin in hourly futures liquidations, signaling heightened volatility and leveraged exposure for the altcoin. XRP’s derivatives market activity has shown signs of increasing instability despite joining the broader market’s downward trajectory. According to updated data from CoinGlass, XRP experienced $1.19 million in liquidations within a single hour, eclipsing Bitcoin’s $823,340 over the same period. This abrupt shift points to a significant level of leveraged trading interest in XRP. The breakdown reveals that long positions bore the brunt of these losses, with nearly the entire liquidation amount attributed to traders anticipating a price increase. In contrast, short positions accounted for just $33,000. The pattern was mirrored in Bitcoin’s case, though on a slightly smaller scale, where long traders also experienced most of the drawdown. Volatility Heightens as Support Levels Break XRP’s rising liquidation volume comes when the asset has shown limited performance strength. The asset recently slipped below a key support level of $2.1, highlighting weakening momentum. It has regained this level, currently trading at $2.12. However, this breakout was not decisive, and the price drop of over 6% over a week has intensified fears that the asset may fall below $2.1 again. XRP recently experienced notable liquidation events , and he concentration of liquidations in long positions suggests that many traders were expecting a bullish reversal that failed to materialize. This mismatch between market sentiment and price action has not only triggered forced exits but may also contribute to further volatility if traders continue to take on excessive risk in anticipation of a rebound. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP’s Market Prospects Although XRP demonstrates signs of independent movement in the derivatives market, it remains closely tied to Bitcoin’s price direction. Historically, XRP has reacted to major BTC trends, and a significant rally in Bitcoin could still catalyze recovery. The broader macroeconomic environment also plays a crucial role in shaping trader expectations. Market participants are closely watching upcoming U.S. Federal Reserve decisions, as any adjustment in monetary policy could affect investor sentiment across the crypto sector. There are rumors that the Federal Reserve will adopt XRP for global transactions. While unconfirmed, a favorable policy shift could reduce risk aversion and stimulate renewed capital inflows into the crypto market. Additionally, recent reports suggest that XRP ETFs may receive SEC approval this month , and the community is excited for the digital asset’s reaction if these products are approved. XRP faces a challenging environment, but multiple factors point toward a bullish reversal in the near term. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

44279828,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/05/best-cryptocurrency-to-buy-now-as-new-hampshire-approves-first-crypto-reserve-law,1746624546,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/44279828.jpeg,Best Cryptocurrency to Buy Now As New Hampshire Approves First Crypto Reserve Law,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/05/best-cryptocurrency-to-buy-now-as-new-hampshire-approves-first-crypto-reserve-law,"Since the beginning of the year, several U.S. states have been exploring crypto as part of their financial strategy, but New Hampshire just took the lead. It’s now the first state to pass a law allowing public funds to be invested in crypto, signaling a shift that could have nationwide ripple effects. With this move, the conversation around the best crypto to buy now becomes more urgent, and Bitcoin just gained a powerful new backer. New Hampshire’s Bitcoin Reserve Law The newly signed law in New Hampshire marks the first time a U.S. state has officially given the green light to invest public funds up to 5% in cryptocurrency. But there’s a strict threshold: only digital assets with a market cap of at least $500 billion qualify, which, for now, means Bitcoin is the sole beneficiary. The law is more than a symbolic move. It’s a blueprint for financial diversification in the face of persistent inflation and federal monetary expansion. According to Rep. Keith Ammon, the bill’s architect, the objective is clear: protect state funds by anchoring part of them in a deflationary digital asset with a finite supply. While Arizona and Florida stumbled, Arizona’s bill was vetoed and Florida withdrew its own proposal—New Hampshire succeeded, thanks in part to lobbying from groups like the Satoshi Action Fund. Its founder, Dennis Porter, called the move a breakthrough, noting that political momentum now has a proven path. This could set off a chain reaction. With North Carolina and others still in the race, New Hampshire’s precedent now provides validation and pressure. As more states consider similar legislation, and as Trump floats a federal reserve of digital assets, Bitcoin’s legitimacy as a store of value continues to solidify in institutional circles. For retail investors watching these moves closely, the writing is on the wall: Bitcoin isn’t just for speculation anymore, it’s being discussed in the same breath as treasuries and sovereign funds. Best Crypto to Buy Now as Crypto Reserve Law Goes Live SUBBD Imagine a platform where creators aren’t at the mercy of algorithms, profit-sharing clauses, or shadow bans. That’s the core proposition behind SUBBD —a project that doesn’t just decentralize the creator economy but reshapes how influence is monetized. The $SUBBD token powers a protocol designed to return control to creators, enabling them to tokenize engagement, loyalty, and access in ways legacy platforms can’t replicate. Rather than treating content as something to be rented out through ads and affiliate links, SUBBD allows it to become an asset—tradable, stakeable, and secured by blockchain rails. Subscriptions are reimagined as tokenized passes. Tipping becomes transparent and on-chain. Entire fan communities can form gated ecosystems where creators set the rules, not platforms. There’s real technical infrastructure behind the promise too: smart contract-based monetization tools, native tipping systems, NFT access layers, and creator-specific DAO governance structures are all in motion. The team’s roadmap includes social plugins for existing platforms and an SDK for creator dApps. SUBBD isn’t merely challenging the YouTubes and Patreons of the world—it’s proposing a parallel creator-led economy where audiences fund creators directly, and attention becomes a tradable asset. As more influencers seek platform independence, $SUBBD may become the first real financial layer built around internet fandom itself. Solaxy Solaxy doesn’t rush to describe itself as a simple meme coin with utility. Instead, it builds quietly at the intersection of utility and responsibility. It is an L2 protocol that acts not only as connective tissue between Ethereum and Solana but also as a statement against the high-emission sprawl of earlier blockchain generations. What sets Solaxy apart isn’t just the technology, it’s the intent. Built with ecological design as a foundational principle, the network embeds green accountability directly into its staking model. Validators earn not just by locking capital but by contributing to carbon offset pools, verified through real-world partners and reflected transparently on-chain. For users, staking $SOLX becomes more than a yield-generating strategy—it’s a vote for sustainable infrastructure. Cross-chain movement is frictionless. Native support for EVM compatibility allows developers to migrate apps and liquidity without starting from scratch. The bridge mechanics are deliberately simplified to ensure high throughput without compromising decentralization, and the ecosystem is already expanding into DeFi, NFTs, and modular gaming frameworks. Where Solaxy truly resonates, though, is in its narrative. It offers more than transactions—it proposes a rebalancing, a way to participate in crypto without sidelining the planet. In a future where regulation and environmental scrutiny will only grow sharper, Solaxy may very well define what “clean” chain infrastructure looks like, quietly becoming indispensable. BTC Bull BTC Bull is more than just a tribute to Bitcoin’s dominance—it’s a mechanism built to respond to it in real time. Every upward move in BTC’s price activates key events within the project, creating a rhythm where the community benefits directly from Bitcoin’s strength. These aren’t vague promises. Specific milestones trigger automatic airdrops for token holders and supply burns that permanently reduce circulation. This milestone-based model transforms Bitcoin’s progress into tangible outcomes. As BTC hits preset thresholds, $BTCBULL becomes more scarce, and early supporters are rewarded with fresh tokens distributed transparently. It’s a system designed for people who don’t just cheer for Bitcoin—they track it closely, knowing that every major jump creates impact across the ecosystem. Dubbed one of the best presales by pages like 99Bitcoins and others, BTC Bull’s influence and popularity have seen a continuous spike in recent weeks. Wrapped in a playful visual identity and meme-rich marketing, BTC Bull still manages to offer structured utility. Community events, social contests, and token rewards all orbit around a single idea: celebrating Bitcoin’s climb while reinforcing its message through memes, staking, and strategic deflation. Built on Solana, the project also benefits from rapid transaction speeds and minimal fees, making it accessible for both active traders and casual holders. BTC Bull doesn’t attempt to imitate Bitcoin—it amplifies it. The project gives Bitcoin believers a way to experience real-time engagement with price action, offering both entertainment and incentive in one of the most straightforward yet powerful designs in the meme-token space. MIND of Pepe There are projects that follow the market and those that try to predict it. MIND of Pepe does something different. It interprets the crowd. Not through speculation, but through data harvested from the very platforms where narratives are born. This is not just a memecoin, and it certainly isn’t another AI gimmick. It is a live AI agent built around the idea that attention moves markets—and that memes are modern-day momentum indicators. At the core of MIND of Pepe is a system that processes real-time inputs from social media, tracking shifts in tone, keyword clusters, influencer activity, and trading chatter. This information is distilled into readable signals and alerts accessible to $MIND holders. Users are not just spectators; they can influence the AI’s behavior, vote on what platforms it listens to more closely, and even customize the type of analysis delivered. Where the token becomes truly interesting is in its function. $MIND grants access to dashboards, early trend indicators, and the potential to front-run meme cycles before they become mainstream narratives. Future plans include sentiment-weighted indexes, NFT-based brain modules that modify how the AI thinks, and on-chain engagement rewards tied to social accuracy. This project leans into the chaotic brilliance of crypto culture, but it does so with precision. It doesn’t just reflect the noise. It deciphers it. For those looking to invest not just in hype, but in the system that understands how hype is formed, MIND of Pepe offers a rare and timely edge. Conclusion With crypto no longer operating on the sidelines of policy or finance, the tone of the market has changed. This is not a moment defined by speculation alone but by a gradual alignment with long-term systems. As governments experiment with digital reserves and Bitcoin starts to resemble more than just a volatile asset, it becomes clearer which types of projects are built for this next phase. The names explored above reflect that shift in pace and purpose. Each one offers a different entry point into where crypto is heading, shaped by utility, vision, or well-timed mechanisms. For those watching the signs rather than chasing the noise, these tokens represent more than passing trends, and could be profitable investments for the coming months.

The Graph rivals some Web2 data oracles for its efficiency and low costs. GRT, its native token, however, remains a victim of general market dynamics and high volatility. If observed over the larger picture, the current sentiment is bearish, with predictions pointing to higher price growth. It is advised to do your own research and conduct investment advice before investing in the volatile market. What can we expect from GRT price analysis next? The Graph price analysis gives out a relatively bullish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. Coin value has sought recovery up to $0.0921 in the past 24 hours. If observed overall, the currency has received up to 3.29% of a boost in the day. Technical indicators give out a relatively neutral verdict with respect to the market scenario. Whereby, the price charts continue to present a strong bullish trend. Why is GRT up? The increase in the Graph’s value could be attributed to the general bullish market sentiment. Moreover, the past few weeks supported the bulls, as the buying pressure remained substantially high. Will GRT reach $0.5? Yes, GRT should rise above $0.5 in 2029. In that year, the price will range between $0.469 and $0.524. Will GRT reach $1? Per the analysts’ price predictions, it remains unlikely that GRT will get to $1 by 2031. Will GRT reach $10? Considering GRT’s current price and market cap, it remains highly unlikely that it will reach $10 in the next ten years. Does GRT have a good long-term future? According to the market assumptions, GRT is set to trade higher in the years to come. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Hence, it is advised to do your own research and conduct in-depth investment advice before investing in the volatile market.

The Graph historic price sentiment GRT price history: Source Coinmarketcap Yaniv Tal, Brandon Ramirez, and Jennus Pohlman launched The Gaph on the Ethereum blockchain in 2018. In June 2020, The Graph held its private token sale, raising $5 million. Some participants included Multicoin Capital, Digital Currency Group, and DTC Capital. The public sale, which took place in October 2020, raised $12 million. Each token sold for $0.03. The mainnet launched in December 2020. In January 2021, another sale led by Tiger Global Management raised $50 million. Looking back, GRT had its best performance in 2021, when it registered its all-time high at $2.88 on February 12, 2021.

44279942,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158126,1746624617,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,US Dollar and Euro Brace for Crucial Fed Decision,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-dollar-fed-decision/,"Global financial markets are often interconnected, and shifts in major currencies like the US Dollar and Euro can have ripple effects that even touch the cryptocurrency world, influencing investor sentiment and capital flows. Currently, the spotlight is firmly on the upcoming Fed decision , a pivotal moment that is causing significant positioning in the Forex market . Traders and investors worldwide are keenly watching how these major currencies react. The Strengthening US Dollar Ahead of the Curve The US Dollar has shown notable strength recently. This uptick is largely attributed to anticipation surrounding the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy meeting. Stronger-than-expected economic data from the United States, particularly concerning employment and inflation, has fueled expectations that the Fed might maintain a cautious stance on potential interest rate cuts, or at least delay them further than initially anticipated. This prospect makes dollar-denominated assets more attractive, increasing demand for the currency. Several factors contribute to the dollar’s current edge: Robust US economic indicators suggest resilience. Higher relative Interest rates compared to many other developed economies. Safe-haven demand amidst global uncertainties. Why the Euro Exchange Rate Remains Resilient Despite the dollar’s upward momentum, the Euro exchange rate has demonstrated surprising resilience. The common currency has not seen a sharp decline against the greenback, managing to hold key support levels. This suggests underlying strength or perhaps differing expectations regarding the European Central Bank (ECB)’s future policy path. While the ECB is also navigating inflation and growth concerns, market participants might be pricing in a relatively slower pace of rate cuts compared to some earlier predictions, or simply waiting for clearer signals from both major central banks before making aggressive moves on the EUR/USD pair. Factors supporting the Euro’s resilience include: Signs of stabilization in the Eurozone economy. Potentially diverging policy paths between the Fed and ECB in the medium term. Existing market positions that are resistant to further significant Euro weakness. The Crucial Fed Decision : What to Expect? The upcoming Fed decision is the main event driving current market sentiment. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will announce its decision on the federal funds rate and release its economic projections. More importantly, the accompanying statement and the subsequent press conference by the Fed Chair will be dissected for clues about the future trajectory of monetary policy. Will the Fed signal a readiness to cut rates soon, or will they emphasize the need to see more evidence that inflation is sustainably moving towards their target? This communication is key. Market expectations are currently leaning towards the Fed holding Interest rates steady at this meeting. The focus is less on an immediate rate change and more on the forward guidance provided. Any hint about the timing and pace of potential future rate adjustments will significantly impact currency valuations, particularly the US Dollar . Understanding How Interest Rates Impact Currencies The relationship between Interest rates and currency strength is fundamental in the Forex market . Higher interest rates in a country tend to attract foreign investment seeking better returns on bonds and other interest-bearing assets. This increased demand for the country’s assets translates into increased demand for its currency, causing it to appreciate. Conversely, lower interest rates can make a currency less attractive to foreign investors, potentially leading to depreciation. For the US Dollar and Euro, the differential in Interest rates set by the Fed and the ECB, as well as expectations about how this differential will evolve, is a primary driver of the Euro exchange rate against the dollar (EUR/USD). Navigating the Forex Market Volatility Post-Decision The period immediately following the Fed decision is often marked by significant volatility in the Forex market . The reaction will depend heavily on how the Fed’s announcement aligns with or deviates from market expectations. Here are potential scenarios and their likely impact on the Euro exchange rate (EUR/USD): Fed Outcome Likely Tone Impact on USD Impact on EUR/USD Hold Rates, Signal Sooner Cuts Dovish Bearish Bullish (EUR strengthens vs USD) Hold Rates, Maintain Current Stance Neutral Neutral to Slightly Bullish Stable to Slightly Bearish Hold Rates, Emphasize Inflation Fight Hawkish Bullish Bearish (EUR weakens vs USD) Traders will be watching not just the rate decision itself, but the language used in the statement and the nuances in the Fed Chair’s press conference regarding economic outlook, inflation assessment, and the conditions required for future policy adjustments. Challenges and Risks in the Current Environment Trading the Forex market around major central bank decisions comes with inherent challenges. Market reactions can be swift and unpredictable, often leading to increased volatility and wider trading spreads. The main challenge is interpreting the central bank’s communication correctly and understanding how it will be perceived by the broader market. Risks include unexpected policy shifts, misinterpretation of guidance, and external economic or geopolitical events that could overshadow the Fed’s message. Actionable Insights: What to Watch For For those interested in how the Fed decision impacts the US Dollar , the Euro exchange rate , and the broader Forex market , here are some actionable insights: Focus on Forward Guidance: The statement and press conference commentary on the economic outlook and future policy path are more critical than the rate decision itself if rates are held steady. Monitor Economic Projections: The Fed’s updated Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), including the ‘dot plot’ showing policymakers’ individual rate expectations, can provide valuable insights into the likely pace of future rate changes. Watch Key Levels: Observe how the EUR/USD pair reacts around significant technical support and resistance levels immediately after the announcement. Risk Management: Given the potential for volatility, employ strict risk management strategies, such as using stop-loss orders. Conclusion: Awaiting the Verdict The stage is set for a significant move in the Forex market as participants await the outcome of the highly anticipated Fed decision . The US Dollar has gained ground on expectations of sustained higher Interest rates , while the Euro exchange rate has shown a degree of resilience. The clarity provided by the Federal Reserve regarding its economic outlook and future policy intentions will be paramount in determining the short-term direction of major currency pairs, particularly EUR/USD. Traders should remain vigilant and prepared for potential volatility as the market digests the central bank’s message.

To read full editions, subscribe . Unlike memecoins — which Blockworks Research thinks are here to stay — an altcoin szn may not come back…at least not in the way we’re used to. The 2020/2021 cycle may have been the peak, K33’s David Zimmerman wrote in a note. “Without fresh retail inflows, the math gets tougher for speculative tokens with no revenue, no product, and no roadmap beyond vibes,” he said. One of the big changes, outside of the overall maturity cycle we see, is that memecoins have really solidified themselves within crypto. To put it another way: Why play a narrative-driven token when you can make a memecoin play instead? As I wrote in the Milk Road last week, memecoins represented roughly 25% of the overall volumes in crypto at the peak of Q1. This means the path forward for altcoins is more likely to be selective. As Zimmerman noted, the overall “altcoin market faces $4.3 billion in token unlocks in May, $2.8 billion in June, and $3.2 billion in July. These unlocks are headwinds that demand a surge in new liquidity to be absorbed.” “In the absence of any significant surge of demand or new retail inflows, the math is simple: more supply facing static or shrinking demand equals downward pressure.” Outside of the obvious need for liquidity, times have simply changed. Back in the day, altcoins could get a boost just by being in proximity to a hot narrative. Now, there’s more of a need for fundamentals (I swear I’m not trying to keep bringing this up , it’s just what’s happening). Zimmerman said that bitcoin will remain dominant, but there will be chances to allocate smaller positions to altcoins. While some may outperform, the “windows are limited and increasingly fleeting.” Tokens may not continue to be the big winners as crypto matures. Take, for example, stablecoins. “The most bullish crypto asset outside of Bitcoin right now is almost certainly stablecoins. They are making their way into payment infrastructure, relentlessly growing in market cap, and positioning themselves at the center of both retail and institutional use cases,” Zimmerman said. In a sea of choices, now investors will have to pay attention to metrics before aping into a token (unless you stick with memecoins). For K33, this means understanding the product-market fit, user growth, or revenue of said token. RIP, face-ripping altcoin rallies. You were fun.

A recent post by crypto analyst STEPH IS CRYPTO on X encapsulates the prevailing sentiment: “This XRP breakout will send us to Valhalla! ” This exclamation reflects the mounting excitement among investors and analysts who anticipate a significant upward movement in XRP’s price. This #XRP breakout will send us to Valhalla! pic.twitter.com/jEc3T1qSlV — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) May 6, 2025 Technical Patterns Indicate a Bullish Outlook XRP is currently exhibiting several bullish technical patterns that suggest a potential breakout. Analyst Rose has identified a falling wedge pattern, a formation that often precedes upward price movements. According to Rose, a breakout above the $2.60–$2.75 resistance zone could propel XRP to targets of $4.21 and potentially $4.95. Similarly, Captain Faibik has observed a symmetrical triangle pattern in XRP’s price action. A breakout from this formation could lead to a 50% surge, aiming for a price of approximately $3.66. These technical analyses underscore the growing optimism surrounding XRP’s near-term prospects. Institutional Developments and Market Sentiment Beyond technical indicators, institutional developments are also bolstering confidence in XRP. CME Group’s announcement to launch cash-settled XRP futures contracts on May 19, 2025, marks a significant milestone. This move reflects the increasing institutional interest in XRP and could enhance its liquidity and credibility in the broader financial markets. Additionally, Ripple Labs’ introduction of the RLUSD stablecoin is expected to strengthen XRP’s position in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The stablecoin aims to facilitate more efficient cross-border transactions, a core use case for XRP. These developments contribute to a positive market sentiment, further fueling the anticipation of a breakout. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Long-Term Price Projections Looking ahead, several analysts have provided ambitious price projections for XRP. EGRAG CRYPTO, a well-known figure in the crypto analysis community, has suggested that XRP could reach between $27 and $33 by May 2025 . This forecast is based on historical price patterns and Fibonacci retracement levels, drawing parallels to XRP’s performance during the 2017 bull run. Another analysis by EGRAG CRYPTO employs Fibonacci and Elliott Wave theories to predict a price of $15 for XRP by May 5, 2025. This projection considers the asset’s current position within a larger market cycle and anticipates a significant upward movement in the coming months. The convergence of bullish technical patterns, institutional advancements, and optimistic long-term forecasts paints a promising picture for XRP. While the cryptocurrency market remains inherently volatile, the current indicators suggest that XRP is poised for a significant breakout. As STEPH IS CRYPTO aptly put it, the anticipated surge could indeed “send us to Valhalla,” marking a new chapter in XRP’s journey within the digital asset landscape.

The company says the expanded registration is intended to support working capital needs and further its Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve strategy. The amended Form S-3 filing would give Thumzup the ability to raise up to half a billion dollars over the next three years through the issuance of various securities, including common stock, preferred stock, warrants, debt securities, and other instruments. The registration is not yet effective, and no securities are being offered at this time. Thumzup currently holds 19.106 BTC, valued at approximately $1.8 million as of May 5, 2025. The company’s board has previously authorized allocating up to 90% of its liquid assets to Bitcoin as part of its treasury strategy.

However, ChatGPT outlined several factors that can help it recover some ground and end the year on a high note. Tech Factors It has been said time and time again in the past several months that ETH’s price has failed to copy any of BTC’s momentum. While the largest cryptocurrency surged to a new all-time high in January 2025 at almost $110,000, Ethereum was stopped on a couple of occasions at $4,000 and came nowhere near its 2021 peak. The current price tag of just over $1,800 means that ETH actually trades lower against the dollar now than it did before the US elections (generally considered the beginning of the current cycle). The ETH/BTC trading pair reached a five-year low at under 0.018 a few weeks back and now sits very close to those levels. Just for reference, the pair was above 0.15 during the 2017/2018 cycle when there was speculation about a potential “flippening.” That’s an 88% plunge! ETH/BTC. Source: TradingView Nevertheless, some analysts are still hopeful that ETH can make a comeback, and ChatGPT outlined what needs to happen for Ethereum to outperform its ‘bigger brother’ (is it really a brother?). The AI chatbot started by laying out the technological advancements the second-largest blockchain needs to go through, such as improved scalability. Network upgrades, such as the just-completed Pectra, can enhance usability and restore some investor confidence in the underlying asset. Market Sentiment ChatGPT noted that both assets attract different types of investors. Bitcoin is seen as “the digital gold, with institutions and individuals largely viewing it as a hedge against inflation and a store of value.” “Ethereum’s value proposition, though, lies in its use case as a programmable blockchain. If Ethereum gains wider adoption and institutional interest—especially in sectors like decentralized finance (DeFi), enterprise blockchain solutions, or NFTs—it could experience significant growth.” Consequently, ETH needs to continue building within its own niche, even though Vitalik Buterin recently made some references to BTC’s simplicity. However, there’s a lot of competition within that field, and Ethereum trails behind some other big names, such as Solana, in terms of transaction speeds and costs. The Layer-2 solutions, which aim to solve both, have also faced a lot of criticism lately. In conclusion, the AI chatbot said Ethereum “has the potential to outperform Bitcoin in certain areas,” but the latter’s role as the “primary store of value and its established position in the market may provide it with a more stable long-term growth trajectory.” In other words, ChatGPT is not too bullish on ETH outperforming BTC this year.

44280263,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158132,1746625220,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,USD Weakness Ahead of Pivotal FOMC and BoE Decisions,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/usd-weakness-ahead-fomc/,"In the dynamic world of global finance, shifts in currency values often signal broader economic trends that can ripple across all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Recently, the focus has been on the USD which has shown signs of underperformance, while the TWD has experienced appreciation. This movement comes at a critical juncture, right before highly anticipated meetings by two major central banks: the US Federal Reserve’s FOMC and the Bank of England ( BoE ). Understanding these shifts in the Forex market provides valuable context for investors navigating the current economic climate. Why is the USD Under Pressure? The recent softness observed in the USD can be attributed to a confluence of factors. Market participants are keenly watching incoming economic data, particularly inflation figures and labor market reports. Expectations regarding the future path of interest rates by the Federal Reserve play a significant role. Any hint that the Fed might be nearing the end of its tightening cycle, or might even consider rate cuts sooner than previously anticipated, tends to weigh on the dollar. Key reasons for the current USD performance include: Changing interest rate expectations: Markets are pricing in potential rate adjustments, influencing capital flows. Relative economic performance: Data from other major economies might be showing comparative strength. Risk sentiment: Shifts in global risk appetite can affect demand for safe-haven currencies like the USD . Yield differentials: The attractiveness of US assets relative to those in other countries impacts currency values. The TWD ‘s Recent Strength While the USD has faced headwinds, the TWD (New Taiwan Dollar) has shown resilience and even appreciation. This performance is often linked to Taiwan’s strong position in the global technology supply chain, particularly in semiconductors. Increased demand for these exports can boost the Taiwanese economy and its currency. Additionally, local economic conditions and capital flows into Taiwanese assets can contribute to the TWD ‘s strength. The relative stability of Taiwan’s economic outlook, especially compared to uncertainties elsewhere, can make the TWD an attractive currency for some investors. Anticipating the FOMC Meeting The upcoming FOMC meeting is arguably the most significant event on the immediate economic calendar for the Forex market . The Federal Reserve’s decisions and forward guidance have a profound impact on global interest rates and currency valuations. Market participants will be dissecting the official statement, the economic projections (Summary of Economic Projections – SEP), and the subsequent press conference by the Fed Chair. What the market is watching for from the FOMC : Interest Rate Decision: Will rates be held steady, increased, or is there a surprise? Dot Plot: The SEP’s ‘dot plot’ shows FOMC members’ individual expectations for future interest rates, offering clues about the policy path. Economic Outlook: The Fed’s assessment of inflation, employment, and GDP growth will shape expectations. Forward Guidance: Any language indicating the Fed’s stance on future policy moves is critical. Any hawkish signals (suggesting higher rates for longer) would likely support the USD , while dovish signals (suggesting rate cuts are closer) would likely reinforce USD weakness. What to Expect from the BoE Decision Simultaneously, the Bank of England ( BoE ) is also set to announce its latest monetary policy decision. The UK economy faces its own set of challenges, including persistent inflation and concerns about growth. Like the FOMC , the BoE ‘s decision on interest rates and its economic outlook will heavily influence the value of the British Pound (GBP) and have spillover effects on the broader Forex market . Key points for the BoE meeting: Interest Rate Vote Split: The vote among Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members reveals the divergence of views within the bank. Inflation Forecasts: The BoE’s view on future inflation is central to its policy stance. Growth Projections: The bank’s assessment of the UK economy’s health. Communication: The tone of the statement and any comments from the Governor. A more hawkish BoE (hiking rates or signaling more hikes) would typically strengthen the GBP, while a dovish stance (holding rates or signaling cuts) would weaken it. The interplay between the FOMC and BoE outcomes creates significant volatility potential in pairs like GBP/USD. Impact on the Forex Market : Scenarios and Insights The simultaneous nature of these central bank meetings creates a period of heightened uncertainty and potential volatility across the Forex market . Traders and investors will be reacting swiftly to the announcements, leading to potentially sharp movements in currency pairs. The relative hawkishness or dovishness of the FOMC versus the BoE will determine the direction of pairs like GBP/USD. Similarly, the USD ‘s reaction will impact pairs like USD/TWD, EUR/USD, and USD/JPY. Actionable Insights for Traders Stay Informed: Pay close attention to the official statements and press conferences from both the FOMC and BoE . Manage Risk: Volatility is expected. Use appropriate risk management tools like stop-losses. Watch Key Levels: Identify significant support and resistance levels on currency charts. Consider Multiple Outcomes: Be prepared for different scenarios based on the central banks’ decisions and guidance. Focus on Relative Policy: It’s not just about what one central bank does, but how it compares to the other. For those interested in the broader financial landscape, including cryptocurrencies, understanding these major Forex market events is crucial. Central bank policies on interest rates and liquidity directly influence the macroeconomic environment, which in turn affects investor sentiment and capital allocation across all asset classes, including digital assets. Summary: Navigating the Central Bank Gauntlet The coming days are critical for the global Forex market as both the US Federal Reserve’s FOMC and the Bank of England ( BoE ) convene. The recent underperformance of the USD and the relative strength of the TWD set a fascinating backdrop for these pivotal meetings. Market participants are on high alert for clues about the future trajectory of interest rates and economic health from both central banks. The outcomes will not only dictate the short-term movements in major currency pairs but also provide significant signals about the global economic outlook, influencing investment decisions across markets, including the evolving cryptocurrency space. Navigating this period requires careful analysis, vigilance, and a focus on understanding the nuances of central bank communication.

This investor is now acquiring a new cryptocurrency linked to POL. The unexpected move has caught the attention of market watchers. The new token is showing signs of significant growth potential. Could this be a signal of shifting trends in the market? XYZ aims for G.O.A.T. status: Early buyers eye 1,000x gains XYZVerse (XYZ) isn’t your average memecoin, it’s fusing the high-octane world of sports with crypto’s fast-moving edge. Built for die-hard fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports, XYZVerse is more than just a token, it’s a competitive movement powered by adrenaline and community. With its bold “Greatest of All Time” (G.O.A.T.) vision, XYZVerse is setting its sights far beyond typical memecoin hype. It’s already turning heads, recently crowned as the Best New Meme Project on the scene. What gives XYZ the edge? Backed by a detailed roadmap and a fired-up community, the project is geared toward lasting impact and serious growth. Fueled by the competitive spirit, XYZ is emerging as a champion in the making, ready to outplay rivals and become a symbol of pride for sports and crypto fans alike.

You might also like: How a $500 stake in XYZVerse might transform over time Polygon fluctuates POL ( ex-MATIC POL ) has experienced notable price fluctuations recently. Over the past week, the coin saw a slight decline of 3.21%, settling within the current price range of $0.22 to $0.24. However, zooming out to the monthly view, POL has demonstrated a significant rebound with a 21.93% increase. Despite this short-term growth, the coin remains down by 23.38% over the past six months, reflecting broader market volatility. Technical indicators point to key levels that could influence POL’s trajectory. The nearest resistance level is at $0.26, with a secondary resistance at $0.28. If the price pushes beyond these thresholds, it might signal a bullish trend. On the support side, levels at $0.21 and $0.19 could provide a safety net against further declines. The 10-day simple moving average is $0.23, slightly below the 100-day average of $0.24, suggesting a cautious short-term outlook. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 53.70, indicating that the coin is neither overbought nor oversold. Meanwhile, a high Stochastic value of 91.17 might hint at potential overbought conditions. Market observers note that while the recent monthly gain is promising, the mixed signals from technical indicators warrant careful attention. POL’s ability to break through resistance levels or hold above support zones could set the tone for its near-term performance. As the crypto market continues to evolve, staying informed on these key metrics remains crucial for those watching POL’s journey. Conclusion While established coins like POL show promise, XYZVerse stands out, uniting sports fans in a community-driven ecosystem aiming for substantial growth and cultural impact.

SEC case conclusion could trigger a market-wide boost for XRP. XRP ’s open interest has seen a marked decline since the token dropped below $2.20 in the opening days of May. On April 28, the number of open XRP derivatives positions reached a 1-month high of 1.52 billion. By May 6, the cryptocurrency’s open interest had declined to 1.37 billion per data retrieved by Finbold from market intelligence platform CryptoQuant , indicating a greatly lessened degree of speculative betting on the part of traders.

Source: Finbold However, in contrast with these bearish developments, there are a few factors at play that suggest XRP prices could soon rebound. Despite low XRP open interest, a significant percentage of traders remain bullish While derivatives positions have declined on the whole, it should be noted that XRP’s long/short ratio remains close to 1-month highs , which demonstrates a healthy dose of bullish sentiment. Moreover, whales have quietly continued with their acquisitions — having bought 900 million tokens in April alone. In addition, Ripple Labs reiterated the importance of the conclusion of the Ripple v. SEC case in its Q1 2025 XRP markets report . Although the case will, most likely, formally conclude in October at the earliest , the new set of regulations that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to issue in tandem with the matter’s closing could provide a market-wide boost — one that XRP would most likely see the greatest benefit from.

While this price zone presents a key short-term challenge, long-term Bitcoin advocates like Michael Saylor are betting on a much bigger upside. Saylor, the founder of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), has been vocal about his $250K Bitcoin price prediction, and his strategy is heavily supported by artificial intelligence (AI). How Saylor’s AI-Driven Strategy is Reshaping Finance Strategy isn’t just using AI for simple data crunching—it’s leveraging AI to design complex financial products. At the recent Strategy World event, Saylor detailed how AI played a pivotal role in creating innovative instruments like the “Strike” (STRK) and “Strife” (STRF) preferred stocks. Michael Saylor explains how to truly leverage AI to lead @MicroStrategy to actual financial innovation #leadership pic.twitter.com/oxgJ19Iyig — Justin Calhoun MBA (@jrc_dev) May 6, 2025 Strike (STRK) – A convertible preferred stock offering an 8% dividend, payable in cash or MSTR stock. It’s designed to attract capital for Bitcoin acquisitions and can be converted into common stock. Strife (STRF) – A non-convertible preferred stock aimed at fixed-income investors, providing stable returns without the price volatility of Bitcoin. Saylor emphasized that these products were developed with the help of AI, making them some of the first AI-designed financial instruments in the market. “We had to tackle complex legal and financial hurdles, and AI was crucial in navigating those challenges,” he noted. This approach has helped Strategy grow its Bitcoin holdings to over $52 billion, a more than 200x increase from its $250 million starting investment in 2020. Mosaic – Strategy’s AI-Powered Data Tool; Bitcoin Supported In addition to financial instruments, Strategy is also using AI to transform data management. Its latest product, Mosaic, aims to revolutionize how companies handle their data, offering real-time insights without the need for traditional, slow data warehouses. Strategy CEO Phong Le described Mosaic as a game-changer, much like how Bitcoin aims to decentralize financial control. Bitcoin Technical Analysis – Potential Trade Setup Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is currently trading around $96,863, facing immediate resistance near the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $96,962. This level, just below the psychological $97,000 mark, is a critical test for bulls aiming to extend the recent rally. The 50-hour Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $95,674 is providing strong support, reinforcing the current uptrend. The MACD shows early signs of weakening momentum, suggesting a potential short-term pullback. However, a break above $97,000 could push Bitcoin towards the next resistance at $97,725, aligning with the recent swing high. Trade Setup: Buy Above: $97,000 (Breakout Confirmation) Stop Loss: $96,110 (Below Key Fib Level) Take Profit: $98,000 (Next Major Resistance) However, if Bitcoin fails to hold above $96,110, it could see a deeper correction toward the 61.8% Fib level at $95,729. Conclusion: The AI Edge in Bitcoin’s Path to $250K Saylor’s strategy isn’t just a tech experiment—it’s a long-term financial play aimed at redefining corporate finance. As more companies adopt AI, the combination of digital intelligence and digital assets like Bitcoin could accelerate BTC’s path to that ambitious $250K target. $SUBBD Token: Your VIP Pass to the Future of AI-Powered Content The content creator economy is booming, now valued at over $85 billion—and $SUBBD aims to redefine this landscape.

A big surge could be on the way with the crypto market potentially establishing a bottom and now swinging back up. Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), and Sonic (SONIC) are layer 1s with breakouts in their sights. $ETH about to embark on its next big swing high Source: TradingView The $ETH price has been under duress for what seems like a very long time now. As Bitcoin ( BTC ) has stolen the show, breaking out strongly, and perhaps now heading back to its highs, the $ETH price has generally slumbered. However, things could be about to change. Ethereum is still the number two cryptocurrency by market capitalization - only second to Bitcoin. The $ETH price looks to have found a bottom, and could be about to break through a descending trendline that has followed the price down since mid-December 2024. This potential swing up from the bottom is supported by the Stochastic RSI in the weekly time frame, which is just about to signal strong upside price momentum. Once $ETH breaks out, and the bulls are able to push the price above the next two major resistances, the rally has to target the last swing high at $4,100. If it fails to get there, it would be a failed rally, while confirming above would give the bulls a shot at the all-time high. $BNB breakout taking place now Source: TradingView Looking at the weekly chart for $BNB it can be seen that the breakout is taking place right now. The bulls broke through the descending trendline last week, and the price came back to confirm the breakout (plus major support) this week. As long as it stays above by the end of play on Sunday, all will be ready for lift-off. The $BNB price has now spent more than a year in this generally sideways price action, and so a breakout here could be a very strong one indeed. The next major resistance is at $674, and if the price is able to break through this and confirm above, this could become the platform for the rest of this bull market. $SONIC building price structure base Source: TradingView The $SONIC price has been meandering sideways since February, laying down the foundational price structure for the next big surge to $0.50. It looks as though $0.26 is becoming a good support level, so it just remains for the price to rise above the $0.28 resistance and head once more up to $0.34. If the price can take hold above this, it would then be based on top of that aforementioned base price structure, and then $0.50, and even $0.79 could follow.

Price is above the 9-day SMA, and RSI is rising at 63.86, indicating growing strength. A potential rounding bottom pattern is forming, suggesting a trend reversal. Consolidation between $1,600 and $1,900 shows accumulation. If ETH breaks above $1,900, further upside toward $2,200 is possible. RSI above 60 supports the bullish outlook if momentum sustains.

Pectra Upgrade Launching May 7: Ethereum will roll out the Pectra upgrade, a merge of the Prague and Electra upgrades. Vitalik Buterin Proposes RISC-V : Ethereum’s co-founder has suggested replacing the EVM bytecode with the RISC-V instruction set, making Ethereum more adaptable, efficient, and future-ready. Base Layer Activity Drops: Despite innovations, Ethereum collected just 3.18 ETH in blob fees, with average gas fees at $0.16 in April, the lowest since 2020. This has raised sustainability concerns but is also making the network more accessible. Ethereum Price Prediction 2025 If Ethereum manages to stay above this support, it could gradually rise towards $2,400 or more by the end of 2025, especially if the market becomes more positive. However, Ethereum will face resistance around $2,500, so it may take time to break through this level. The Ethereum price is expected to maintain its upward trajectory and form higher highs. Furthermore, with increased adoption, newer upgrades, and network growth, the ETH coin price can smash the $5k mark and hit a new all-time high of $5,925. Conversely, rising uncertainty or any unfavorable global economic events could pull the ETH price toward its annual low of $2,917. Considering the market sentiments, the average price could settle at around $3,392.

Ethereum Price Forecast 2027 The Ethereum 2027 forecast expects the ETH coin price to make a new all-time high at $8,705.

Will the Solaxy Presale Explode?",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/companies-left-and-right-are-buying-solana-promising-a-rally-will-the-solaxy-presale-explode/,"SOL Strategies, a Canadian investment company focused on the Solana ecosystem, just bought 122,524 $SOL at an average price of $148.96. This brings the total purchase value to $18.25M. It’s worth noting that this acquisition is part of the company’s $500M convertible note facility with ATW Partners. An institutional purchase like this also aligns with SOL Strategies’ wider plans to expand its validator business. A validator, in case you didn’t know, is a blockchain participant that verifies and adds new transactions on the blockchain. The more assets a participant ‘stakes,’ the more chances that it ‘validates’ the next block. In this article, we’ll quickly unpack Solana’s positive future outlook and also suggest why the Solaxy presale is among the best cryptos to buy now , seeing as it won’t just benefit from a $SOL boom but also fuel one. Institutions Keen on Buying $SOL SOL Strategies seems to be following in the footsteps of MicroStrategy (now, Strategy), which has acquired more than 528,000 $BTC over the last few years. Similarly, DeFi Development Corp. (JNVR) has submitted an SEC application to raise $1B through a fresh security issue. It plans to use the funds (or a part of them) to purchase $SOL. Note that it already holds $48.2M worth of the asset. As a result of its fresh $SOL purchase, SOL Strategies’ shares have jumped over 90% in the last two weeks. It’s currently trading at around CA$2.6. These purchases directly strengthen our three-pillar strategy of enterprise grade validators, strategic SOL holdings, and Solana technology innovation. – SOL Strategies CEO Leah Wald . It’s worth noting that Solana has also been showing great technical strength of late. After dipping past $100 during the tariff sell-off, the token has risen around 50% and is now trading at $147. The bounce has also occurred from the 200 EMA (exponential moving average), which is a strong bullish indicator. Although far from its all-time high of $295, large institutional buying is a solid vote of confidence in the long-term viability of the project. If you believe in Solana’s future and want to ride its growth, there could hardly be an altcoin better than Solaxy. After all, it’s the first-ever Solana L2 that overcomes all the shortcomings of Solana L1. What Is Solaxy ($SOLX)? Solaxy ($SOLX) is a new cryptocurrency that plans to solve all of Solana’s troubles. As mentioned earlier, despite the fact that Solana’s popularity is consistently increasing, the blockchain network wouldn’t be able to reach its full potential ($300 and beyond) until it fixes its congestion and scalability issues. These problems came into existence when hyper-successful coins like $TRUMP and $MELANIA, as well as the meme coin launchpad Pump.fun, brought in a flurry of new investors to Solana. This clogged the network, which started experiencing performance bottlenecks during heavy traffic. Solaxy will build the first-ever Layer 2 solution on Solana. Essentially, Solaxy’s answer to Solana’s troubles is offloading some transactions from the network’s mainnet onto a sidechain. That’s not all, though, because as part of Solaxy’s cutting-edge roll-up technology, it will also bundle multiple transactions into single, optimized batches. These will then be sent for on-chain validation. Overall, Solaxy will reduce the congestion on Solana and increase its affordability without sacrificing the network’s security. The Solaxy Presale Has Raised Over $33.5M in Early Investor Funding $SOLX dominates our list of the best crypto presales on the market right now thanks to class-leading investor interest in the project. Even better, Solaxy is looking all set to return the investors’ confidence in kind. As per our $SOLX price prediction , the token could explode nearly 12,000% and reach a high of $0.20 by the end of 2030. It’s worth noting that Solaxy’s unprecedented future potential is also because it’s more than just a medicine for Solana. $SOLX, a multi-chain token, can also be used for high-frequency dApps. These include: Platforms for meme coins and micro-transactions, Gaming ecosystems that need real-time interactions, and Custom financial applications that require low latency and cost efficiency. If you want to catch Solaxy before it becomes a top trending crypto , now’s the best time to buy it. It’s currently in presale, so you can buy $SOLX now for a low price of $0.001716. For more help with the purchase process, check out our detailed guide on how to buy Solaxy . If you’d like to know more about the project, read through its whitepaper . Also, check out its X feed and Telegram channel for timely updates. Last but not least, kindly remember that despite their breathtaking potential, both Solaxy and Solana could fall short of your expectations. But that’s just how the crypto market is, i.e., unpredictable and volatile.

44280547,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158134,1746625824,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Amazon AI: Revolutionizing Code Generation with Project Kiro,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/amazon-ai-code-generation/,"In the fast-evolving world of technology, where innovation often dictates the pace of progress in sectors like blockchain and cryptocurrency, the tools developers use are constantly being redefined. Imagine a future where building the next decentralized application or optimizing smart contracts becomes significantly faster and more intuitive. This vision is becoming clearer as major tech players invest heavily in artificial intelligence, particularly in automating development tasks. Today, we’re looking at a significant move from one of the biggest names in cloud computing that could dramatically impact how code is written: Amazon’s latest venture into AI Code Generation . Amazon AI’s Ambitious ‘Kiro’ Project Amazon Web Services (AWS), the cloud powerhouse behind countless online services and a critical infrastructure provider for many crypto projects, is reportedly deep into developing a new AI-powered code generation tool. Codenamed “Kiro,” this ambitious project aims to provide developers with a powerful assistant capable of transforming natural language prompts and existing data into functional code. According to reports based on internal documents, Kiro is designed to interact with AI agents to generate code in what’s described as “near real-time.” This capability suggests a highly responsive system that can keep pace with a developer’s workflow, providing code snippets, functions, or even larger blocks of code almost instantly as they work. What Makes Kiro a Potential Game-Changer? Beyond simple code suggestions, Kiro is envisioned as a comprehensive Coding Assistant . Here are some of the key features and capabilities reported: Multimodal Capabilities: While the exact nature of its multimodal functions isn’t fully detailed, this could imply the tool’s ability to understand and generate code based on various inputs, such as text prompts, code examples, documentation, or even potentially visual representations like diagrams. Web and Desktop Applications: Kiro is expected to be accessible through both web and dedicated desktop applications, offering flexibility for developers working in different environments. Third-Party AI Agent Integration: A particularly interesting aspect is the ability to configure Kiro to work with third-party AI agents.

How Does Kiro Compare to Existing AWS AI Tools? Amazon isn’t new to the AI coding space. They already offer Amazon CodeWhisperer, an AI-powered coding companion, and more recently launched Q Developer, an evolution described as akin to GitHub Copilot. While Q Developer focuses on being a helpful coding assistant providing suggestions and answering questions within the IDE, Kiro appears to be a more advanced, agent-driven system focused explicitly on generating larger, more complex code structures and related documentation from higher-level prompts. It represents a significant step forward in Amazon’s commitment to leveraging AWS AI for developer productivity. The Hot Market for Generative AI Tools Amazon’s move into this advanced form of AI Code Generation comes at a time when the market for Generative AI Tools aimed at developers is experiencing explosive growth and significant investment. The demand for tools that can automate coding tasks, speed up development cycles, and lower the barrier to entry for building complex applications is immense. The competitive landscape is heating up rapidly. Companies like Anysphere, makers of the Cursor code editor, have reportedly achieved valuations reaching $9 billion, signaling strong investor confidence in AI-native development environments. Similarly, Windsurf, another player in this space, is reportedly nearing a potential acquisition by OpenAI for a substantial $3 billion. These figures underscore the perceived value and future potential of tools that can effectively harness AI to assist or even perform coding tasks. While Amazon was reportedly considering a launch for Kiro towards the end of June, those plans might be subject to change. Nevertheless, the existence and reported capabilities of Project Kiro signal Amazon’s serious intent to become a dominant force in the AI-assisted development market. What Does This Mean for Developers and the Tech Ecosystem? The rise of powerful AI coding assistants like Kiro has profound implications. For developers, it could mean faster prototyping, less time spent on boilerplate code, and more focus on complex problem-solving and creative aspects of development. For companies, it promises increased productivity and potentially lower development costs. In sectors like blockchain, where rapid iteration and secure, efficient code are paramount, tools like Kiro could accelerate the development of decentralized applications, smart contracts, and infrastructure. The ability to quickly generate code, flag potential security issues, and create technical documentation could be invaluable. However, it also raises questions about the future role of developers, the potential for new types of bugs or vulnerabilities introduced by AI-generated code, and the need for developers to adapt and learn how to effectively collaborate with these powerful AI tools. The focus may shift from writing every line of code to guiding, verifying, and refining AI-generated outputs. Summary: Amazon’s Bold Step in AI Code Generation Amazon Web Services’ development of Project Kiro represents a significant investment in the future of software development. By building an advanced AI code generation tool capable of real-time output, multimodal input, and integration with other AI agents, Amazon is positioning itself at the forefront of the generative AI revolution in coding.

S&P 500 gained 0.32% as it opened higher after consecutive sessions of downward pressure for stocks . While the Nasdaq was up by 0.29%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged higher at the open, climbing more than 200 points as investor attention turned to the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision expected later in the day. Gains sees the major U.S. indices appear set to end a two-day losing streak that materialized as markets remained cautious amid tariffs uncertainty . However, news that top U.S. officials were set to meet their Chinese counterparts buoyed sentiment. Futures tied to the three major indexes rose as investors welcomed the prospect of formal trade talks between the two countries. You might also like: Dow Jones drops 400 points as tariffs are back in focus With stocks having rallied before on bullish takes regarding the U.S.-China trade talks, analysts say clarity would be welcome. But given the likelihood that nothing much happens in coming weeks has dampened the upward look. Investors are thus watching out for developments in this tariffs space. Notably, the most recent labor data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicated an addition of 177,000 jobs in April. This was above the expectations of 138,000, with this coming in as the unemployment rate held at 4.2%. While this showed a solid April, tariff concerns linger. Robert Kaplan, Goldman Sachs vice chairman and former Dallas Fed president, told CNBC’s ‘Squawk Box’ on Wednesday that the tariff issues will need to be solved first before the U.S. economy sees a further slowdown. The immediate market attention is also on the Federal Reserve, which is completing its two-day meeting on May 7. Key to investors will be the Fed’s policy decision and Chair Jerome Powell’s speech. While markets have priced in a 96% chance that the central bank will keep rates unchanged, focus will be on Powell. In particular, it will be on what he says about the U.S. economy as well as what the Fed sees as its trajectory for interest rates.

At this point, the announcement of the meeting between the two countries improved investor confidence in the crypto market and increased major altcoins such as Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Cardano (ADA) and Dogecoin (DOGE), apart from Bitcoin. With the US-China trade war winding down, attention has turned to today’s FED decision, an important macro event that could determine Bitcoin’s short-term direction. After January, when the FED kept interest rates constant, dollar, gold, stock market and cryptocurrency investors are wondering when the first interest rate cut of 2025 will be made, while it remains uncertain whether the FED will make a surprise. When Will the May FED Interest Rate Decision Be Announced? The FED will announce its May interest rate decision on May 7, 2025 at 21:00 Turkish time. Following the decision, FED Chairman Jerome Powell will make oral statements at 21:30. In Which Direction Are Expectations Focused? While the overwhelming majority of the market, 98%, expects the FED to keep the policy rate constant in the range of 4.25% – 4.50%, only a small segment of 2% expects interest rates to be reduced to the range of 4.00% – 4.25%. At this point, the market does not expect the FED to cut interest rates due to the negative conditions created by the tariffs. Experts believe the Fed will prefer to wait and see how the new tariffs will affect the U.S. economy before changing interest rates. Deutsche Bank analysts think that the Fed will hold off on interest rate cuts for a longer period of time and keep interest rates steady this month to see how the economic picture will shape in the coming months. Olu Sonola, Head of US Economic Research at Ritch Ratings, said the latest employment report was good in every way. Noting that the labor market indicated resilience rather than recession in the latest report, Sonola argued that the latest economic data was also positive, but that the FED would wait on reducing interest rates. Powell Statements Are Very Important! While it is unlikely that the FED will make a surprise rate cut as expected, signals from the policy text and Powell's statements are expected to have an impact on the direction of the markets. At this point, Powell's stance on inflation, growth and interest rate cuts will guide the Bitcoin and crypto markets. Experts say Powell is cornered and that Powell and the FED have a difficult choice to make. “Keep interest rates steady and risk further economic slowdown, or cut rates and risk reigniting inflation.” US President Donald Trump is also pressuring the Fed to lower interest rates. What Awaits Bitcoin and Crypto Markets? It is stated that if Powell's attitude in his speech is moderate, a new upward momentum can be expected in Bitcoin and altcoins, while it is estimated that a hawkish attitude may cause the BTC price to retest the support around $92,000. *This is not investment advice.

This will make the seamless integration into Line’s messenger-based Mini DApp ecosystem possible. This will also allow users to send and receive USDT for payments, DeFi, and peer-to-peer transactions directly with a familiar platform. Additionally, Tether strengthened its compliance infrastructure by partnering with Chainalysis to integrate institutional-grade monitoring tools into its Hadron platform for tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs). This move supports the growing regulatory demands and builds confidence among institutional users. Tether is also pushing into artificial intelligence with the upcoming launch of Tether AI, a decentralized, open-source platform that merges crypto payments with censorship-resistant AI services. Tether Expands Presence in Asia Tether recently expanded its flagship stablecoin, USDT, to the Kaia blockchain through a new partnership with Line Next, the Web3 division of Japan’s messaging giant Line. The move integrates USDT into Line’s messenger-based Mini DApp ecosystem and its self-custodial wallet, and allows users to send and receive the stablecoin for payments, cross-border transfers, and DeFi-related activities in an interface they already use daily. According to Tether’s May 7 announcement , this collaboration enhances the accessibility of stablecoins in everyday consumer life, particularly in Asia. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino pointed out that the expansion is part of the company’s commitment to boost global stablecoin adoption, especially in Asia’s tech-savvy markets. Users of Line will also be able to earn mission-based rewards in USDT and conduct peer-to-peer transfers via the in-app wallet. More features are also expected in the future. Key features (Source: Tether ) Kaia blockchain, the infrastructure behind Line’s Mini DApps, offers instant finality and low-latency transactions, which makes it very well-suited for stablecoin integration. Kaia DLT Foundation chair Sam Seo explained that the partnership’s goal is to deliver a fast and seamless USDT experience across various platforms, including Line, DeFi applications, and centralized exchanges. Youngsu Ko, CEO of Line Next, said the collaboration will serve as a ”dollar-based gateway,” helping users access Web3 services more easily and making them more practical for daily use. USDT is still the world’s largest stablecoin, with a circulating supply of more than 149.4 billion tokens. Tether is also making it a priority to expand its footprint aggressively by minting another $1 billion USDT on the Tron network on May 5, which now holds $71.4 billion of the token. Tether Partners with Chainalysis for RWA Monitoring Tether also recently announced a new partnership with blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis to improve compliance and risk monitoring across its growing tokenization platform. The integration brings Chainalysis' suite of institutional-grade tools directly onto the Hadron by Tether platform, which was launched in November of 2024 to serve institutions, corporations, and governments interested in tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs). These assets include a wide range of instruments like financial products, real estate, commodities, and debt. The collaboration is part of the broader shift in the crypto landscape toward increased regulatory oversight and a heightened focus on transparency. Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, said that the integration allows for robust risk management, real-time transaction monitoring, and Know-Your-Transaction (KYT) capabilities without undermining the decentralized ethos of blockchain technology. The move is also expected to improve institutional confidence in using blockchain for high-value asset transfers. Since Hadron’s debut, the tokenized RWA sector saw a lot of growth. Data from RWA.xyz indicates the total market value of tokenized RWAs surged to $22 billion, which is up 10.5% over the past month, with the number of RWA token holders rising 5.6% to reach 100,115. This growth certainly suggests that platforms like Hadron are gaining traction as viable infrastructure for the token economy. RWA market overview (Source: RWA.xyz ) Chainalysis was founded in 2014, and cemented its role as a cornerstone of blockchain compliance infrastructure. It already partners with major industry players including Crypto.com, Bitfinex, MoonPay, and Spanish banking giant BBVA. The firm expanded its capabilities over the past few months through the acquisition of Web3 security firm Hexagate in December 2024 and AI fraud detection startup Alterya in January 2025. These moves made it possible for Chainalysis to address the challenges of digital asset security and fraud, especially as the firm forecasts that 2025 could see a record surge in crypto scams driven by advances in artificial intelligence. The financial strength behind this expansion is also interesting. Tether posted an operating profit of $1 billion for the first quarter of 2025, after generating $13 billion in profits throughout 2024. The partnership with Chainalysis signals that Tether is ready for yet another successful year by expanding its footprint in regulated, institutional markets. Tether Expands Into AI In addition to all of its other developments, Tether is also preparing to launch its new artificial intelligence platform, Tether AI. This platform will integrate cryptocurrency payments and operate on a decentralized infrastructure. CEO Paolo Ardoino unveiled the initiative on May 5 through a post on X, and called it a gateway to “personal infinite intelligence.” The platform will support peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions in major cryptocurrencies, including USDT and Bitcoin, enabling direct payments without centralized intermediaries. Tether AI is being designed as a fully open-source runtime environment, free from reliance on API keys or central control points. Ardoino explained that the platform will be modular, composable, and able to run on any device or hardware to offer maximum adaptability. Its decentralized structure aims to provide a censorship-resistant AI experience, which will help it stick to Tether’s broader vision of technological freedom and self-sovereignty. The AI platform’s payment functionality will be enhanced through Tether’s open-source wallet development kit (WDK), which was launched in November of 2024. This toolkit allows developers to build self-custodial wallet applications for mobile, desktop, and web, ensuring users have complete control over their crypto assets. By combining this infrastructure with the AI platform, Tether is positioning itself to offer a seamless and privacy-focused experience for managing digital assets and AI tools in tandem. Tether AI is a key component of Tether’s expansion beyond stablecoins. In April 2024, the company underwent a restructuring to introduce new divisions focused on data, AI, and peer-to-peer applications, under the umbrella of Tether Data. This pivot will help achieve the company’s long-term ambition to lead in both decentralized finance and decentralized intelligence. Ardoino also previously shared that the Tether AI division is working on multiple applications, including translation tools, voice assistants, and AI-powered Bitcoin wallet assistants. Post from Paolo Ardoino (Source: X ) Drawing inspiration from science fiction author Isaac Asimov, Ardoino described AI as a force that will “become part of the very fabric of the universe.” With Tether AI, the company appears intent on building a decentralized framework that aligns with this expansive vision.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|USDT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-07 13:55:32

The rebound has been flashing a light on the growing strength of the bulls, which suggests a larger price action could be in place. The FOMC rates are underway, and the markets have begun to react positively, as they always do before the announcement. The Bitcoin price climbed above $97,000 , while the LTC price is above $90. Meanwhile, more volatility is expected in the coming hours, which may elevate the price close to $100. However, the question arises whether the bulls will secure the gains above $100 or face a rejection to drop back to their initial levels. The central bank is expecting the rates to remain unchanged at 4.25% to 4.5%, while the Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s comments are expected to have a major impact on the markets. The LTC’s recovery from the tariff-triggered crash to $63 signals a prolonged ascending trend after the token turned the resistance at $80 into a strong support. Moreover, the price reclaimed the 50-day MA at $83.48 and seems likely to achieve the 200-day MA at $112 soon. The long-term price action of Litecoin is extremely bullish, while the latest rebound from $63. Moreover, the token is about to experience the very first weekly Golden Cross, which is expected to offer a strong bullish momentum. To do so, the token is expected to maintain a consolidated ascending trend and rise above the average bands of the rising parallel channel, at around $96. Meanwhile, these popular indicators have also turned bullish, hinting towards the price being at the foothill of a massive explosion. The weekly MACD suggests a drop in the selling pressure, while the levels are heading for a bullish crossover. On the other hand, the RSI has rebounded and is about to rise above the average range. Once the RSI also displays a bullish crossover, the Litecoin price is expected to rise above $100 and secure the levels at the pivotal resistance at $105. If the price sustains above the range throughout the month, a rise in the buying pressure could help the price to breach the channel and initiate a strong bull run to a new ATH.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|LTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-07 13:56:53

44280879,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158135,1746626428,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin ETF’s Stunning Ascent: BlackRock IBIT Overtakes Gold ETF in Inflows,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-etf-blackrock-inflows/,"Get ready for a significant shift in the investment landscape! A major milestone has just been reached that highlights the growing prominence of digital assets in traditional finance. BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF , known by its ticker symbol IBIT, has officially surpassed the venerable SPDR Gold Trust (GLD), which holds the title of the world’s largest gold ETF, in year-to-date net inflows. This isn’t just a statistic; it’s a powerful signal about where sophisticated money is starting to flow and the increasing legitimacy of Bitcoin as an asset class. Is the Bitcoin ETF Overtaking Gold in Investor Preference? The data paints a clear picture. According to insights shared by Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas, BlackRock IBIT has recorded an impressive $6.96 billion in net inflows since its launch this year. This significant figure places it at sixth among all exchange-traded funds across various asset classes. Hot on its heels, but ultimately trailing, is the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD), which garnered $6.5 billion in net inflows during the same period, ranking seventh overall. This comparison is particularly striking because GLD has long been a benchmark for store-of-value investments within the traditional ETF structure. For a newly launched Bitcoin ETF to attract more capital than this established giant in such a short timeframe is a testament to the pent-up demand and enthusiasm surrounding regulated Bitcoin exposure. Understanding BlackRock IBIT ‘s Remarkable ETF Inflows The success of BlackRock IBIT isn’t happening in a vacuum. It’s a confluence of several factors: Brand Recognition: BlackRock is one of the world’s largest and most trusted asset managers. Their entry into the Bitcoin space lends significant credibility. Ease of Access: A spot Bitcoin ETF allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements through familiar brokerage accounts, avoiding the complexities of directly buying, storing, and securing cryptocurrency. Regulatory Clarity: The SEC’s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. provided a level of regulatory certainty that many institutional and retail investors were waiting for. Market Timing: The launch coincided with renewed positive sentiment in the crypto market, driven by factors like the upcoming Bitcoin halving and anticipation of rate cuts. These elements combined have made IBIT a highly attractive vehicle for capital seeking exposure to Bitcoin, resulting in substantial ETF inflows that have quickly added up. What Does This Mean for Institutional Adoption ? The fact that large sums of money are flowing into BlackRock IBIT and other spot Bitcoin ETFs is a strong indicator of growing institutional adoption . Institutions, financial advisors, and wealth managers are now comfortable allocating portions of their portfolios to Bitcoin through these regulated products. This move signifies a maturation of the asset class and its integration into mainstream finance. For years, Bitcoin proponents have argued for its potential as a ‘digital gold’ – a store of value resistant to inflation and government control due to its decentralized nature and finite supply. The significant ETF inflows into IBIT relative to the SPDR Gold Trust suggest that this narrative is gaining traction among a wider, more traditional investor base. It’s not just retail investors driving this; the sheer volume indicates participation from larger players who see Bitcoin, accessed via an ETF, as a viable alternative or complement to traditional safe-haven assets like gold. Comparing Bitcoin and Gold: The Digital Gold Narrative Takes Hold The comparison between Bitcoin and gold is central to understanding this trend. Both are seen by many as stores of value, but they have distinct characteristics: Scarcity: Bitcoin has a capped supply of 21 million coins. Gold’s supply increases slowly through mining, but the total amount is not strictly capped in the same way. Portability & Divisibility: Bitcoin is infinitely divisible and can be sent anywhere globally instantly and cheaply. Physical gold is cumbersome to transport and divide. Verification: Bitcoin transactions and supply are transparently verifiable on the blockchain. Verifying gold’s purity and authenticity requires physical inspection. Storage: Bitcoin can be stored digitally (with appropriate security measures). Gold requires physical storage, which can incur costs and security risks. Volatility: Bitcoin’s price is historically much more volatile than gold’s. Regulation: Gold markets are well-established and regulated. While Bitcoin ETFs bring regulation to accessing Bitcoin, the underlying asset’s regulatory status varies globally. The substantial ETF inflows into IBIT indicate that for a growing number of investors, the advantages of the ‘digital gold’ narrative, combined with the ease of access via an ETF, are outweighing the historical stability associated with the SPDR Gold Trust . The Future: Could Bitcoin ETF Assets Eclipse Gold ETF Assets? The early success of products like BlackRock IBIT is fueling bold predictions. Eric Balchunas’ projection that Bitcoin ETF assets could potentially reach three times those of gold ETFs within the next three to five years, while ambitious, highlights the perceived growth trajectory. Several factors could contribute to this: Continued Institutional Adoption: As more financial advisors and institutions become comfortable with Bitcoin ETFs, allocations could significantly increase. Network Effects: As more capital enters the Bitcoin ecosystem, its legitimacy and utility as a store of value could be further reinforced, attracting even more investors. Price Appreciation: If Bitcoin’s price continues to appreciate over the long term, the total value of assets held in Bitcoin ETFs will naturally grow. Generational Wealth Transfer: Younger generations, who tend to be more comfortable with digital assets, are set to inherit significant wealth, which could lead to increased allocation towards Bitcoin and related investment products. While challenges remain, including market volatility and evolving regulations, the trend of significant ETF inflows suggests a potential long-term shift in how investors think about diversifying their portfolios and storing value, favoring digital assets like Bitcoin accessed through vehicles like the BlackRock IBIT . Actionable Insights for Investors What does this development mean for you as an investor? The surpassing of GLD by IBIT in inflows is a powerful signal of mainstream acceptance. It doesn’t necessarily mean you should abandon gold or rush into Bitcoin, but it underscores the increasing importance of understanding digital assets. Educate Yourself: Learn more about Bitcoin, blockchain technology, and how Bitcoin ETFs work. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Bitcoin is still a volatile asset. Ensure any investment aligns with your personal financial goals and risk profile. Consider Diversification: For some, a small allocation to digital assets via a regulated ETF like IBIT might be part of a diversified portfolio, potentially alongside traditional assets like gold. Do Your Due Diligence: If considering a Bitcoin ETF , research the specific fund, its fees, and its holdings. The competition between the traditional Gold ETF and the new wave of Bitcoin ETF products is just beginning, and the early results show a clear momentum shift towards digital assets in terms of attracting fresh capital. Conclusion: A New Era for Digital Assets BlackRock IBIT’s achievement of surpassing the SPDR Gold Trust in year-to-date net inflows is a landmark event. It highlights the rapid ascent of the Bitcoin ETF as a credible investment vehicle and provides compelling evidence of growing institutional adoption . This shift in ETF inflows from a long-standing safe-haven asset like gold towards Bitcoin, facilitated by products like BlackRock IBIT , reinforces the narrative of Bitcoin as ‘digital gold’ and signals a potential long-term reallocation of capital in the global financial system. While the future holds uncertainties, this moment marks a significant validation for the digital asset space and suggests that the competition between traditional and digital stores of value is heating up, with Bitcoin gaining significant ground.

The price could hit a high of $3.99 in 2025. XRP Price Today: XRP value has fallen 1.78% in 24 hours to $2.13. XRP has been making positive shifts in the crypto market. In a very recent XRP news, Japan’s banking sector is preparing for a major transformation, with nearly 80% of banks planning to adopt XRP in 2025. It has also surpassed Ethereum in trading activity. On the other hand, XRP ETFs are what every investor is curious about. In the latest update on the Ripple vs SEC case, Attorney Fred Rispoli has provided an updated timeline for the SEC v. Ripple case. He stated that the necessary documentation had already been produced following Alderoty’s declaration, and they are now awaiting a vote by the SEC Commission, which is expected in 30 days. Talking about the XRP price, it is down by 1.78% to $2.13. If the bullish momentum starts, XRP could aim at its resistance level of $2.20. On the flip side, if it loses out on steam, the XRP price could take a plunge to $2.09. Our Ripple XRP price prediction will explore the potential answers to questions such as “Will XRP reach $10 in 2025?” and “Will XRP go up?” What is the XRP price prediction for today? According to the XRP price analysis done by our expert panel, the XRP crypto price today could go as high as $2.20.

The 9-day SMA is slightly above the current price, indicating mild bearish pressure. RSI near 53 suggests neutral momentum. Visible patterns include a potential ascending triangle forming since April, signaling bullish consolidation. If XRP breaks above $2.25 with volume, upside continuation is likely. Support is near $2.00. Overall, XRP shows consolidation with a bullish bias for May 2025 if resistance levels are breached. XRP Price Prediction May 2025 High Price : $2.50 Low Price : $1.85 Average Price : $2.0 XRP Price Prediction 2025 The SEC believes that XRP can help release funds stuck in the U.S. Nostro accounts, which can then be used to buy more Bitcoins. There is more positive news for Ripple, as they have integrated their stablecoin RLUSD into their cross-border payments network: Ripple Payments . Moreover, JP Morgan Chase has approved XRP for use within its banking payment framework. If things go in favor of Ripple, the XRP price could surge to a maximum of $5.81 by the end of 2025. In contrast, if the lawsuit continues, the value of XRP could remain in a narrow range with a potential low of $2.3. That being said, we can expect an average Ripple price of $4.89. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.3 $4.89 $5.81 Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Year Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) 2026 5.6 6.25 8.64 2027 7.15 8.89 12.25 2028 11.3 14.11 16.53 2029 13.98 16.48 21.12 2030 16.92 19.87 26.97 XRP Price Prediction 2026 XRP cost will likely witness strong growth in 2026. There is a possibility that XRP can break through the $8.64 level and hold the price by the end of 2026. The minimum price of XRP will be around $5.6, with an average trading price of $6.25. This could be a result of Ripple’s role in CBDC development and XRP’s rising institutional demand. Ripple Price Prediction 2027 By 2027, market analysts and experts predict that XRP coin price will range between $7.15 to $12.25. XRP price might record an average level of $8.89. The reason behind this surge could be due to Ripple’s increasing domination in the payment sector, accelerating XRP’s buying demand and utility. XRP Price Prediction 2028 In 2028, Ripple could increase its use cases, including new dApps and announcements regarding XRP. This might boost the dominance of XRP as the second-largest altcoin by market cap. We expect the XRP future price to range between $11.3 to $16.53. The average trading price of Ripple could be around $14.11. XRP Price Prediction 2029 Partnerships with multiple governments and wider adoption might strengthen XRP’s price in 2029. The price of XRP might record a trading range between $13.98 to $21.12, with an average price of $16.48. XRP Price Prediction 2030 The XRP prediction 2030 depends on Ripple’s ability to expand its offerings across the crypto market. If everything remains positive, the Ripple coin price could scale between $16.92 to $26.97. With that price range, the average tag could be $19.87.

On May 7, 2025, he officially filed a request for a U.S. presidential pardon, hoping President Donald Trump will clear his name. Zhao was convicted in 2024 for violating U.S. anti-money laundering laws. Now, with crypto regulation shifting under Trump’s pro-business policies, CZ is making a bold move to rewrite his story – and maybe reenter the industry in a big way. Redemption Begins Now? Zhao’s legal troubles led to a historic $4.3 billion penalty for Binance and forced him to step down as CEO. The core issue? Weak anti-money laundering systems that allowed suspicious transactions to slip through. By filing for a pardon, he’s clearly aiming to reclaim his status in the crypto world. It’s a calculated step that could help him reset his public image – from convicted exec to crypto pioneer wronged by a broken system. Will it play out how he intends it to? Trump’s “Business Mindset” Gets CZ’s Approval In a recent interview , Zhao made it clear – he’s a fan of Trump’s leadership style. He praised the former president for treating global diplomacy like a business negotiation, saying it’s more practical and honest than traditional politics. And for good reason! Trump’s second term has brought a more crypto-friendly approach, and Zhao’s public support could be a strategic way to align himself with that energy. With Trump in office, Zhao is clearly betting on a second chance – politically and professionally. “It’s not your typical geopolitical-style negotiation. It’s actually a very typical business type of negotiation. In business, you go super high, then go low, then high again – you fluctuate until you eventually land at a spot that works. That’s very common in the business world.” However, not everyone sees this as a win. Critics say granting a pardon could hurt ongoing efforts to regulate crypto more strictly and hold bad actors accountable. Regulators will likely view CZ’s move as controversial, especially so soon after his sentencing. SBF Watching Closely – Could He Try the Same? Zhao’s pardon request is also putting a spotlight back on Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), the former FTX CEO who’s now serving a 25-year sentence for fraud tied to FTX’s collapse. Sources say SBF’s family and legal team have been quietly pushing for a Trump pardon too. But unlike CZ, SBF faces a bigger uphill battle. His fall triggered massive losses for everyday investors, and he’s seen as a cautionary tale across the industry. Still, if Trump approves Zhao’s request, it could set a surprising precedent and SBF might try to follow the same path.",News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-07 14:09:41
44281176,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158140,1746627031,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Binance Alpha Spotlights Exciting OBOL Token Addition,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/binance-alpha-adds-obol/,"Exciting news from the world of crypto discovery! Binance Alpha , a special feature nestled within the Binance Wallet designed to highlight promising Early Stage Crypto projects, has just added the OBOL Token to its curated list. This move, announced via their official X account, puts OBOL on the radar of potentially millions of Binance users looking for the next big thing. What is Binance Alpha and How Does it Spot New Crypto Projects ? Think of Binance Alpha as a reconnaissance tool for the curious crypto explorer. Its main purpose is to sift through the vast and rapidly expanding universe of digital assets and bring attention to those in their nascent stages that show particular promise. How do they decide which projects make the cut? Binance Alpha focuses on a couple of key indicators: Community Engagement: Projects with active, growing, and passionate communities are often a good sign of underlying interest and potential adoption. Market Trends: They look at how emerging projects are performing and being discussed within the broader crypto ecosystem. By focusing on these aspects, Binance Alpha aims to provide users with a head start in discovering potentially impactful New Crypto Projects before they become mainstream. Meet the OBOL Token : What Does This Project Do? The addition of the OBOL Token brings attention to the Obol Network. Obol is working on developing distributed validator technology (DVT) for Ethereum staking. In simple terms, DVT allows multiple people or entities to jointly operate a single Ethereum validator key securely. This is significant because it can help improve the decentralization, resilience, and security of Ethereum staking, making it less prone to single points of failure. The OBOL Token is the native asset of this network, likely playing a role in its governance, security, or operations. Highlighting such infrastructure-focused projects is key to understanding the foundational developments happening in the Early Stage Crypto space. Why Does Being Featured on Binance Alpha Matter? Getting featured on Binance Alpha , especially for an Early Stage Crypto project like OBOL, is a significant milestone. It offers: Massive Visibility: Placement within the Binance Wallet exposes the project to a huge global audience already engaged in crypto. Increased Interest: It can pique the interest of potential investors, users, and developers who trust Binance’s platform for discovery. Validation (Early Stage): While not an endorsement for listing, it signals that the project has met Binance’s initial criteria for visibility based on community and trends. For users navigating the Binance Wallet , it provides a convenient and somewhat curated list of projects to research further, saving them time in identifying potentially interesting New Crypto Projects . Is Binance Alpha a Guarantee of Future Success? This is the most critical point, and one that Binance is clear about: Inclusion on Binance Alpha does NOT guarantee a future listing on the main Binance exchange. This is a crucial distinction. Binance Alpha is a discovery tool, not a pre-listing announcement platform. Investing in Early Stage Crypto projects, by their very nature, carries substantial risks. These projects are unproven, their technology may not scale, market adoption is uncertain, and volatility can be extremely high. While being featured on Binance Alpha provides visibility, it doesn’t mitigate these inherent risks associated with New Crypto Projects . How Can You Explore New Crypto Projects on Binance Alpha? If you’re a Binance Wallet user and want to see which projects are currently featured, including the OBOL Token , you can typically find the Binance Alpha section directly within the wallet interface. Look for sections dedicated to discovery, trending projects, or new additions. Exploring this feature is a great way to stay informed about developments in the Early Stage Crypto landscape. Navigating the Risks of Early Stage Crypto While the opportunity to discover New Crypto Projects early is exciting, it’s paramount to approach it with caution. The projects highlighted on Binance Alpha are, by definition, early stage, meaning they are higher risk than established cryptocurrencies. Always remember the golden rule: Do Your Own Research (DYOR) . Investigate the project’s whitepaper and technology. Evaluate the team behind the project. Understand the tokenomics and potential use cases for the OBOL Token or any other featured asset. Assess the overall market sentiment and competitive landscape. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Being featured on Binance Alpha is a starting point for your research, not the conclusion. Conclusion The addition of the OBOL Token to Binance Alpha is a positive development for the Obol Network, granting it valuable exposure within the vast Binance Wallet ecosystem. For users, it presents an opportunity to discover potentially exciting Early Stage Crypto projects focused on crucial infrastructure like Ethereum DVT. However, it’s vital to temper enthusiasm with caution. Remember that inclusion is not a guarantee of future success or exchange listing. Use Binance Alpha as a tool for discovering New Crypto Projects , but always conduct thorough personal research before making any investment decisions in the dynamic and often volatile world of crypto.

Analyst Highlights Pivotal Markers,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-navigates-critical-price-levels-analyst-highlights-pivotal-markers/,"In a recent analysis shared on X, prominent crypto analyst Ali outlined two critical price levels that could shape the future trajectory of XRP. According to Ali, the $2 and $2.26 price points represent key support and resistance levels, respectively. A decisive close outside this range could significantly influence the next major trend for XRP, indicating either a bullish breakout or a bearish correction. The statement has sparked considerable interest among XRP enthusiasts and traders, given the ongoing volatility in the broader cryptocurrency market. Key levels to watch for $XRP are $2 and $2.26. A decisive close outside this range could set the tone for the next major trend. pic.twitter.com/GvBd4bFdjj — Ali (@ali_charts) May 6, 2025 Analyzing the $2 Support Level The $2 price level for XRP has been a focal point in recent market discussions, acting as a crucial support threshold. Historically, when XRP has managed to sustain itself above this level, it has often maintained bullish sentiment, allowing for gradual price appreciation. Analysts note that retaining this support is vital to prevent bearish momentum from taking over. Should XRP fail to hold above $2, it could trigger a cascading effect where traders begin liquidating positions, pushing the price toward lower supports at $1.90 or even $1.54. The significance of this level also stems from market psychology. As a round number, $2 serves not just as a technical marker but as a psychological barrier, where investor confidence could either solidify or falter. During previous rallies, maintaining this level has reinforced long-term bullish perspectives, while losing it has led to heightened market anxiety and increased selling pressure. Breaking the $2.26 Resistance While $2 serves as a critical support, the $2.26 level has emerged as a formidable resistance point for XRP. Multiple attempts to break through this price have been met with selling pressure, suggesting that market participants are cautious at this juncture. Analysts believe that overcoming this resistance would not only reaffirm bullish momentum but also open the door to new price targets. Breaking past $2.26 could lead to a potential rally toward the next resistance zones at $2.61 and $2.90. Such a movement would likely attract momentum traders looking to capitalize on a breakout. However, to sustain upward movement, trading volume needs to remain robust, indicating continued buyer interest rather than a fleeting spike. Sentiment and Market Dynamics Ali’s cautionary stance highlights a key aspect of market dynamics: speculative hype versus sustained growth. While a break above $2.26 might generate excitement, it remains crucial to assess whether the move is driven by fundamental factors, such as institutional adoption or technological advancements on the XRPL, rather than mere speculative enthusiasm. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The current macroeconomic landscape also plays a role in XRP’s potential price movement. With the U.S. Federal Reserve maintaining a hawkish stance on interest rates, liquidity across crypto markets has been strained. Investors are advised to consider these external factors when evaluating XRP’s short-term potential. Technical Indicators and Market Outlook Technical analysis supports Ali’s assertion that a close outside the $2 to $2.26 range could set the tone for XRP’s next trend. Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) and Relative Strength Index (RSI) readings suggest that XRP is teetering between bullish and bearish territory. If buying pressure increases, pushing XRP above $2.26, the MACD could cross into positive territory, indicating upward momentum. Conversely, a fall below $2 could see the RSI slipping into oversold regions, signaling potential downward pressure. XRP’s positioning between the critical levels of $2 and $2.26 highlights the asset’s current state of flux. As noted by Ali, the outcome of this price battle will likely shape the next major trend, whether bullish or bearish. Investors and traders are advised to monitor these levels closely while factoring in broader market conditions and sentiment shifts. As XRP continues to navigate these pivotal price points, strategic decision-making will be key to capitalizing on the potential outcomes.

With 27% of ETH already staked , these ETF holdings alone could increase the amount of total staked ETH by more than 10%. And that’s without factoring in additional inflows from investors drawn to the promise of earning staking yield inside an ETF wrapper. The question now therefore isn’t can institutions stake: it’s when and how they’ll do it. That “how” matters, however: if ETH ETF staking is approved, issuers may default to third-party operators or route staking through a handful of custodians. This could result in validator power concentrating quickly, especially considering current custody providers, creating centralized entities. Lido still leads with over 30% of staked ETH, but under the hood there are more than 500 operators with the inception of Community Staking Module last year. But if a wave of institutional ETH money flows into just a few trusted intermediaries, Ethereum risks drifting toward a validator oligopoly on centralized operators. This chart shows the total ETH held by ETFs in purple, which would be the second largest staker as a category, and in orange the top three ETFs holding ETH. TVL= total value locked. On the flip side, there’s a rare opportunity for ETF issuers to go direct, running their own nodes. Vertical integration into staking infrastructure allows issuers to both decentralize the network and unlock economic upside. The standard validator fee — typically 5–15% of staking rewards — is currently captured by operators and the liquid staking protocol managing the staking pools, such as Lido, RocketPool and even the centralized wallet exchanges pools. However, if ETF managers run their own nodes or partner with independent providers, they can reclaim that margin and boost fund performance. In an industry competing on basis points, that edge matters. We’re already seeing an M&A trend underway. Bitwise’s acquisition of a staking operator is no coincidence: it’s a signal that smart asset managers are positioning for a future where staking isn’t just a back-end service but a core part of the fund’s value chain. This development represents Ethereum’s fork in the road, in which institutions can either treat staking as a plug-and-play checkbox, reinforcing centralization and systemic risk, or they can help build a more credibly neutral protocol by distributing operations across validators. With a short queue, an expanding set of validators and billions of ETH sitting idle, the timing couldn’t be better. So as the institutionalization of staking looks increasingly likely, let’s make sure it’s done right, reinforcing the foundations of what blockchain is all about.",CoinDesk Indices|Ethereum ETF|ether ETF|TVL|CoinDesk Indices|Crypto Long & Short|Opinion|Opinion,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|MINING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-07 15:18:44
44283480,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158230,1746631131,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Less Anonymous and More Hybrid Online Casinos Launched,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/less-anonymous-and-more-hybrid-online-casinos-launched/,"No KYC casinos see release slow down as crypto market correction dominates March and April, meanwhile hybrid sites dominate in 2025. Toronto, Canada – 7 May 2025 – There has been a certain shift in the type of Bitcoin casinos launched in 2025, the website Crypto Lists reports following an analysis of the 680+ sites reviewed by them. The expert team of reviewers are experienced in spotting trends in the crypto casino market and their observations have led to a conclusion of a downward trend in the launch of new no-KYC sites, even if the quality improves. Playing catch up While anonymity-focused casinos had been a certain emergent trend in 2024, this year started with an increase in hybrid casinos offering the best of both worlds. In 2025, over 93% of all online casinos with some crypto deposit method also have support for e-wallets and fiat payments. That is a significant increase from 2024 when around 86% of all reviews on Crypto Lists were hybrid ones, accepting both cryptocurrencies and fiat. Although the team do classify anonymous casinos and no-KYC casinos separately for their audience, when grouped as one larger category it’s observable that eight sites that don’t require documentation have been released to date so far in 2025. By their classification, to be truly anonymous the site must not even ask for personal information such as date of birth on sign up, and only two of those brands fulfil that criterion. For comparison, in 2024, by this point in the year there had only been three of the completely anonymous style of crypto casinos launched. Some of the anonymous casinos from last year have shut down in 2025, making the list of available options even smaller than initially anticipated. It has been a challenging year for new no-KYC casinos although some in the space think that as the wider cryptocurrency market hopefully recovers throughout the remainder of 2025, there’s a possibility that the industry will see an uptick in these launches. Hybrids continue to rise If we observe Crypto Lists’ calculation shows that only 27 crypto casino brands that also accept fiat have been released so far in 2025, compared to 55 in the same period last year, it points to an observable trend. There are fewer pure crypto casinos released, but they make it easier to get started. Many of the newer Bitcoin casinos have opened up for as many deposit methods as possible, both fiat and crypto, in order to target a wider audience. This usually comes with more KYC and less anonymity. Tom White, Head of Content at Crypto Lists, remarks: “While new casinos launching is always a positive, in order to drive in new crypto players there needs to be more crypto-focused, no-KYC sites launching more regularly. This is the desired kind of site for that particular profile of player.” In relation to the above, the crypto payment processing market has become even more fragmented in terms of payment processors, and there are considerably more options now than a year ago. On the one hand, this is a win for customer convenience but on the other it could be argued it’s a negative in regards to creating confusion. Tom White from Crypto Lists says that “drowning in a sea of options springs to mind.” About CryptoLists CryptoLists is a leading review site that covers crypto projects, casinos accepting deposits with cryptocurrencies, and important industry events in this space.

But as investors evaluate bitcoin’s role in their portfolios, the events of April are worth analyzing in order to understand the asset’s emerging reputation as a store of value. Backdrop of volatility The turbulence sparked by President Trump’s tariffs announcement on April 2 sent stock prices plummeting the following day, with the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 falling 4.8% and 5.4%, respectively. Bitcoin followed suit as the VIX Volatility Index hit levels not seen since the early days of COVID and fears of retaliatory trade measures prevailed. However, bitcoin’s price began to recover sharply within days of the announcement, causing its correlation with both the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 to fall below 0.50, before those correlations rose again as the April 9 pause on tariffs brought back “risk-on” mode. Bitcoin’s correlations to traditional markets in April Source: Hashdex Research with data from CF Benchmarks and Bloomberg (April 01, 2025 to April 30, 2025). 30-day rolling correlations (considering only workdays) between bitcoin (represented by the Nasdaq Bitcoin Reference Price Index) and TradFi indices. This short-term observation matters because it supports the changing nature of how investors perceive bitcoin. While some still categorize bitcoin as a high-beta “risk-on” asset, institutional sentiment is beginning to reflect a more nuanced understanding. Bitcoin recovered faster than the S&P 500 in the 60 days that followed the COVID outbreak, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the U.S. banking crisis in 2023 , events in which it demonstrated resilience and a profile increasingly aligned with that of gold during stress. These periods of decoupling establish a pattern where bitcoin displays its antifragile properties, allowing allocators to protect capital during systemic events, while still outpacing the performance of stocks, bonds and gold over the long haul. Bitcoin vs. traditional assets, 5-year returns Source: CaseBitcoin, Return data from May 1, 2020 to April 30, 2025 (CaseBitcoin.com) The path to digital gold Maybe more compelling than bitcoin’s longer-term returns are the long-term portfolio effects. Even a small allocation to bitcoin within a traditional 60% stock/40% bond portfolio would have improved risk-adjusted returns in 98% of rolling three-year periods over the last decade . And these risk-adjusted returns are markedly higher over longer time frames, suggesting that bitcoin’s volatility from positive returns more than counterbalances short-term drawdowns. It might still be premature to claim that bitcoin has been universally accepted as “digital gold,” but that narrative, supported by its response to geopolitical events, is gaining momentum. The combination of bitcoin’s fixed supply, liquidity, accessibility and immunity to central bank interference gives it properties no traditional asset can replicate. This should be appealing to any investor, large or small, in search of portfolio diversification and long-term wealth preservation.",CoinDesk Indices|tariff|digital gold|store of value|CoinDesk Indices|Crypto Long & Short|Opinion|Opinion,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-07 15:20:30

Revolut is now using Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) Lightning Network through Lightspark to let users send crypto instantly and with lower fees, making digital payments faster and cheaper, according to a company post. The move is designed to reduce network costs and transaction times, tapping into what Lightspark describes as the “open Money Grid.” Revolut’s GM of Crypto, Emil Urmanshin, said the integration is part of the fintech company’s broader goal to offer faster and more affordable financial services. Revolut also recently launched its mobile crypto exchange app, Revolut X, for users in the U.K. and European Economic Area, enabling trading of over 400 crypto pairs and 220 tokens. The mobile rollout followed its earlier desktop launch and expanded the platform’s reach after announcing plans for European growth in November 2024.

The flagship cryptocurrency is up nearly 4% over the past 24 hours as it tests the upper limits of its consolidation range, buoyed by scheduled US-China trade talks. Metaplanet Takes Total Bitcoin Holdings To 5,555 Japanese firm Metaplanet completed the acquisition of 555 Bitcoin as part of its aggressive accumulation strategy. The latest purchase takes the company’s total Bitcoin holdings to 5,555 BTC . The Tokyo-listed firm disclosed that it acquired 555 Bitcoin for $53.4 million at an average price of $96,134. The firm also announced the issuance of another $25 million in zero-coupon ordinary bonds to fund its BTC purchases. The firm has raised 35 billion yen ($244 million) through zero-coupon bonds and stock acquisition rights since 2024 via its partner, Evo Fund. The firm’s proprietary key performance indicator, BTC Yield, has registered a significant increase in recent quarters, reaching 309.8% in Q4 2024, 95.6 in Q1 2025, and 21% in the current quarter. Metaplanet recently announced plans to launch a US subsidiary, Metaplant Treasury, based in Florida. The subsidiary plans to raise $250 million to fund its Bitcoin strategy and tap the US markets. Metaplanet is Asia’s largest public corporate holder of Bitcoin. UK Rules Out Bitcoin Reserve The United Kingdom has ruled out creating a crypto reserve, with Economic Secretary to the Treasury Emma Reynolds expressing a negative outlook towards Bitcoin , stating that the government did not think it was appropriate for the market. However, Reynolds indicated the UK was willing to leverage blockchain technology for government finance. She also disclosed the government was exploring the use of distributed ledger technology for sovereign debt issuance. Reynold’s remarks come amid growing digital asset cooperation between the US and the UK. Reynolds highlighted recent discussions between the US Chancellor of the Exchequer and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and confirmed the formation of a senior official-level working group focused on digital assets. Bitcoin Could Reach $250K In 2025 Bitcoin is currently hovering around the $97,000 mark as it displays resilience and maintains its push towards $100,000. Joe Burnett, Director of Market Research at Unchained, believes BTC is just getting started at $100,000 and predicted a move to $250,000 this year and moving to a staggering $1 million by 2030. Burnett stated on X, “I definitely would not be surprised at all to see $200,000 Bitcoin or $250,000 Bitcoin this year.” He highlighted the improving macroeconomic conditions as a key driver, stating, “Looking at the current macro setup for Bitcoin, global M2 is starting to break out. The VIX hit a recent all-time high that we haven't seen since literally March 2020 and before that, December 2008.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is up over 3% in the past 24 hours as it tests the upper limits of its trading range. The flagship cryptocurrency currently trades at $97,300 as it eyes a move to $100,000 after starting the week on a bullish note. BTC had surged to an intraday high of $98,000 on Friday but lost momentum over the weekend, dropping to $94,390 by Sunday. However, it has made a strong start to the week amid reports the US and China will officially hold trade talks this weekend, potentially de-escalating the trade war. Trade tensions have impacted investor sentiment in recent months, and a thaw could see BTC surge to new highs. Meanwhile, in another positive development, the US state of New Hampshire signed a law allowing the US state treasurer to invest 5% of public funds into Bitcoin. Institutional demand has also risen, further buoying markets. Markets are expected to turn their attention to the Federal Reserve’s FOMC meeting and interest rate decision. The Federal Reserve is expected to leave interest rates unchanged at 4.25% to 4.50%. The Fed has no reason to lower interest rates, especially with inflation above 2% and the labor market holding up. However, it finds itself in a challenging spot thanks to the divergence between US soft data, which has deteriorated considerably, and US hard data, which has remained resilient despite trade tensions and tariff turmoil. BTC ended the previous weekend on a bearish note, dropping almost 1% on Sunday (April 27) and settling at $93,803. The price recovered on Monday, rising 1.28% to claim $95,000 and settle at $95,002. However, the price was back in bearish territory on Tuesday, falling 0.70%, slipping below $97,000, and settling at $94,342. BTC faced volatility on Wednesday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Sellers ultimately gained the upper hand as the price registered a marginal decline and settled at $94,155. Bullish sentiment returned on Thursday as BTC rose over 2%, surging past $96,000 and settling at $96,458. The price surged to an intraday high of $98,000 on Friday. However, it could not stay at this level and settled at $96,939, ultimately registering an increase of 0.50%.

Pepo, a pseudonymous delegate whom other token holders entrusted to vote on their behalf, had participated in Uniswap’s governance since 2023. He wielded 455,000 UNI tokens, making him one of the top 20 largest delegates. The reason for the departure? Other organisations involved in the running of Uniswap — primarily the nonprofit Uniswap Foundation — have pushed aside the opinions of DAO members and have been unreceptive to feedback, Pepo said in an X post. “The Foundation’s behavior seems to have prioritized insulation over collaboration, and in doing so, may have actively harmed Uniswap,” Pepo said. Devin Walsh, Executive Director of the Uniswap Foundation, didn't provide direct comment to CoinDesk when asked about the accusation. However, she did provide a rebuttal on social media. “Delegate participation is essential to the success of the Uniswap ecosystem,” she said on X. “The Uniswap Foundation takes their feedback seriously.” Uniswap is the biggest decentralized exchange with some $4 billion worth of deposits , down 60% from its peak of nearly $10 billion total-value-locked during 2021-2022 , according to DefiLlama data. Like many DeFi protocols, Uniswap is controlled and managed through a somewhat byzantine structure. The protocol was created by Uniswap Labs, a for-profit company which is also responsible for its continued development. The Uniswap Foundation, a nonprofit, is tasked with supporting Uniswap and its community, while protocol changes and allocation of resources is controlled by the Uniswap DAO, a type of crypto collective governed by holders of the UNI token. In March, the DAO granted the foundation $165 million to boost Uniswap ecosystem growth and development. This gave the foundation a mandate to do certain things in pursuit of its goals without directly consulting the DAO. Some, like Pepo, feel the Uniswap Foundation’s actions are putting the DAO’s interests behind those of itself and Uniswap Labs. This situation highlights the persistent struggle to balance the interests of DeFi protocol token holders with those of other stakeholders. Not the first time Pepo isn’t the only one to highlight a perceived lack of DAO control at Uniswap. In October, Billy Gao, vice president of Stanford Blockchain Club, a Uniswap delegate, said Uniswap Labs’ sudden decision to launch its own blockchain “raised serious questions about DAO governance.” Gao argued that the Uniswap DAO should have been told about the blockchain ahead of time and allowed to weigh in on key decisions in its implementation. “It calls to question (once again) how decentralized [Uniswap’s] governance actually is,” he said. Uniswap Labs did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Others have questioned how the Uniswap Foundation uses the funds granted to it, and have complained that it isn’t transparent enough about its spending and decision making. “Transparency and communication are values that many delegates agree with,” Doo Wan Nam, Co-founder of DAO governance solutions provider StableLab, a Uniswap delegate, told CoinDesk. “There have been improvements.” On May 1, the Uniswap Foundation responded to criticism by creating a Foundation Feedback Group, intended to ensure effective communication and strengthen accountability between the foundation and the DAO. Additionally, as a nonprofit company, the foundation must legally publish its finances. But the problem is that for some delegates, it’s not enough. “It’s a loss for any DAO whenever a delegate feels the only way to make an impact is through stepping down,” PaperImperium, Governance Liaison at Uniswap DAO delegate GFX Labs, told CoinDesk. Behind the scenes Some governance participants also complained that a lot of Uniswap DAO communication and decision-making happens privately, instead of publicly on the Uniswap governance forums. This has led to complaints that major decisions are all agreed on by large delegates behind closed doors before going to a public vote. It’s necessary for proposals to receive a degree of feedback before being presented publicly, Nam said. It’s not unlike traditional governance. “Congressmen won't just blindly write bills without talking to relevant stakeholders or other Congressmen,” Nam said. But it’s a double-edged sword. As DAOs mature, there’s also a sense that they are becoming more about politics and appearances rather than pursuing what’s best for the protocol. Multiple Uniswap delegates declined to comment to CoinDesk when asked about the complaints highlighted by Pepo.

Corruption and Executive Order Critique Speaking at the Financial Times Digital Asset Summit, Scaramucci criticized Trump’s growing presence in the crypto world, which includes projects like the TRUMP meme coin and World Liberty Financial. He argued that these ventures serve as distractions at a time when bipartisan consensus on crypto regulation is needed. “Let’s give them all the benefit of the doubt,” Scaramucci said. “But I do think that there’s pathways for some level of corruption, potential bribery and sinistership.” The SkyBridge Capital founder added that eliminating such distractions could help build trust in crypto among older lawmakers who are still skeptical about the industry. Although critical of the president’s crypto dealings, Scaramucci gave the Trump administration a “B-plus, A-minus” rating for its broader handling of digital asset policy. He praised White House crypto adviser David Sacks for trying to build support among Democrats for a U.S. Bitcoin Stockpile. However, he criticized Trump’s move to establish a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve via executive order. The 61-year-old believes that by doing so, it creates the risk of a future Democratic president reversing the order. Instead, he argues that “there has to be a bipartisan commitment” for such an initiative. Millions In Losses for TRUMP Holders Chainalysis data shared with CNBC shows that of the total 2 million, around 764,000 wallets that bought the TRUMP meme coin have lost money. Meanwhile, just 58 wallets have made more than $10 million each, generating a combined $1.1 billion in gains. TRUMP experienced a major price rally after its official website promised top holders a seat at a special dinner with the president. The event, scheduled for May 22 at Trump National Golf Club in Washington, D.C., includes a reception for the 25 largest wallets and a White House tour. Interest in the coin surged more than 50% after the announcement, with its market cap peaking at $2.7 billion. According to Chainalysis, since April 15, about 100,000 new wallets have joined the project. Around 54,000 of these were created shortly after the dinner was revealed. Further, although 80% of the token’s supply remains locked, insiders have already earned more than $324 million through trading fees that are automatically routed to wallets linked to the project. As a result, the TRUMP coin and World Liberty Financial are now under Senate scrutiny. Lawmakers are examining potential conflicts of interest with the president’s family, its ownership structure, and funding sources.

Shamiso Maswoswe , chief of the Investor Protection Bureau for the New York AG, hoped the federal watchdog would weigh in during the court dispute by filing a brief on its ETH view, according to a document produced through a Freedom of Information Act request Coinbase filed with the SEC. ""We would like to request that the SEC file an amicus in support of the argument that Ether is a security,"" she wrote in the request. ""Whether it is or not will not be dispositive in our case (we have authority over both securities and commodities) — but I think it would be beneficial to investor protection to get a court to hold that Ether is a security."" This and other private crypto-related messages sent and received inside the SEC were made available on Wednesday as Coinbase opened online access to more documents it's gained in legal tussles with federal authorities . The company's earlier releases of documents included a range of letters from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. that backed up industry contentions that U.S. banking regulators actively pressured banks to maintain a distance from crypto. In New York's 2023 request, it didn't get what it asked for as the SEC kept the agency's ETH views largely locked down. The U.S. agency had signaled an early view that ETH was likely a commodity, then it seemed to waver after the protocol shifted to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, but the SEC ultimately fell into a stance implying ETH is a commodity, like bitcoin (BTC).

The agency has been steadily issuing statements about aspects of the digital assets sector it considers outside its securities realm. For New York's case, the outcome didn't matter much, because its Department of Financial Services regulates both securities and commodities under one roof, unlike the federal government's oversight regime that splits between the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission. In December of 2023, New York secured a $22 million settlement with KuCoin over its failure to register as an exchange in the state, in which state Attorney General Letitia James noted she would ""continue to take action against any company that brazenly disregards the law and jeopardizes New Yorkers’ savings and investments.""

To read full editions, subscribe . Bitcoin miners are earning more than $1.2 billion per month to secure the chain. What are they securing, exactly? At its core, the collective hash power of honest miners ensures that bad actors can’t suddenly build up and release a second, dubious chain that might usurp the current one’s claim as the longest. Together with full node operators, miners also protect the chain from non-standard transactions. But miners can only ever select transactions that full nodes (which they generally operate themselves) have already deemed to be valid. So, how do those nodes decide which transactions are valid? That’s the role of Bitcoin Core’s relay code, which enforces standardness rules that determine whether a transaction ever makes it to a miner’s mempool at all. Those standardness rules (also referred to as policy rules) secure Bitcoin in a very different way. They effectively define what Bitcoin is and isn’t, and they’re routinely up for debate. On This Day: Ordinals take Bitcoin This time around, discussion has centered on the lifting of a policy rule that capped OP_RETURN outputs at 80 bytes, limiting the amount of arbitrary information that can be posted to the network through individual transactions. Two years ago to the day, however, Bitcoin was reckoning with the sudden popularity of digital collectibles protocol Ordinals, which utilizes three other opcodes introduced under the Taproot umbrella in 2021. At the time, 425,000 transactions were sitting in the Bitcoin mempool, as represented by Jochen Hoenicke’s full node, breaking the previous record of almost 262,000 from peak bull market in December 2017. Average bitcoin transaction fees spiked to more than $31, up from $2 days earlier. Through Ordinals, files of close to 4MB (enough to fill an entire block ) have been written to Bitcoin including images, videos, audio and video games without relying on OP_RETURN, thereby avoiding its 80-byte limit altogether. The purple arrow points to May 7, 2023, when Ordinals hype really set in . All this has made Bitcoin a content storage network, to some degree. Each Ordinal is, essentially, tokenized non-financial data that can be traded peer-to-peer — the type of nonsense utility that had been typically reserved for virtual machine chains like Ethereum and Solana. These days, Ordinals activity has cooled, but has its moments. Bitcoin Core developers, in lifting the 80-byte policy rule on OP_RETURN data, are hoping to reduce the incentives for further workarounds that might damage the network in unknown ways. “The change re-affirms that Bitcoin is governed by transparent, minimal rules rather than editorial preference,” Blockstream engineer Gregory Sanders wrote . “By retiring a deterrent that no longer deters, Bitcoin Core keeps the policy surface lean and lets the fee market arbitrate competing demands.” Times like these remind us that Bitcoin is not sentient, but it does evolve. For living things, it’s the biological code inside DNA that informs how they grow. On the other hand, Bitcoin’s “blind watchmaker” is the collective resolve of its active developers, even if they don’t have unanimous support for their proposed changes, as expressed through the willingness of miners, node operators and users to adopt them. Or, as Sanders put it: “Dissenting parties remain free to modify software, run stricter policy, or propose new resource limits if empirical harm emerges.” Get the news in your inbox.

The prominent financial institution sees BNB, the utility token of the BNB Chain ecosystem, hitting giant strides in the next three years. Specifically, the outlook suggests the token will surge 360% from the current market price of around $604 to $2,775 by 2028.Before then, Geoff Kendrick, Standard Chartered’s head of digital asset research, speculated a slow but intentional price swell. He predicted a rally to $1,275 this year, then $1,755 and $2,225 in 2026 and 2027, before trading near $2,800 in the subsequent year. BNB Price Outlook Standard Chartered BNB Price Outlook | Standard Chartered Catalyst for Sustained RallyDespite less traction coming BNB’s way, it still controls a considerable amount of the global crypto market cap. It currently ranks as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, with a valuation of $84.5 billion.Meanwhile, Kendrick tied the expected price uptrend to BNB’s trend like an outweighed index of Bitcoin and Ethereum. He identified that the asset has been closely mirroring the returns and volatility of the two largest cryptocurrencies in the space since May 2021 and predicted the indexing to continue pushing BNB price to new highs.This suggests that as long as BTC and Ether continue to appreciate, BNB will follow suit. Notably, Standard Chartered had earlier predicted that Bitcoin and Ethereum would surge to new price discovery in the coming years, specifically forecasting the former would hit $500,000 and the latter $7,500 by 2028. BNB’s Binance Tie Sustaining RelevanceRemarkably, Kendrick highlighted several downsides contributing to the lack of buzz around BNB in comparison to other caliber assets like Ether and Solana. He called the BNB Chain ecosystem’s native token an outdated token stuck in the 2021 DeFi boom and a “centralized Ethereum backed by Binance.”The analyst further described BNB Chain as a largely centralized blockchain. It uses the proof of staked authority (PoSA), a consensus that changes its set of 45 validators every 24 hours. Furthermore, Binance's central control and a lack of developer traction further add to the network’s ordeal.Nonetheless, its ties with the largest crypto exchange by trading volume and token deflationary model have kept it afloat. Furthermore, its profound decentralized exchange presence, owing to PancakeSwap’s sustained user influx, has ensured BNB’s relevance.As a result, with Binance’s influence not going away and BNB’s sustained correlation with BTC and Ether, Kendrick noted that BNB could be a proper benchmark asset for gaining exposure to the broader cryptocurrency market. Meanwhile, CryptoQuant recently called BNB the most resilient asset in the current market, counteracting assertions that the token closely mirrors the market’s tune.",Market|Latest Binance Coin (BNB) News Market Updates,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-05-07 15:31:58

This milestone, recently spotlighted by Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, shows the growing change in investor behavior, as they flock toward crypto-focused investment vehicles amid a spike in global adoption.BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Surpasses GLD in YTD FlowsSpecifically, the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has attracted $6.96 billion in YTD inflows for 2025, slightly edging out the SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), which recorded about $6.5 billion over the same period. BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Surpasses GLD in YTD Flows The development is especially notable considering gold's impressive 29% price surge this year. Despite that strong performance, GLD has struggled to retain investor confidence, having seen substantial outflows since early 2024. Notably, between Jan. 11 and Feb. 14, 2024, alone, investors withdrew around $2.6 billion from GLD. However, inflows appear to have recovered since then.In contrast, IBIT's momentum has been notable. Since launching in January 2024, the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF has accumulated an astounding $44.25 billion in net inflows. Notably, IBIT set a record on Nov. 7, 2024, when it absorbed a single-day inflow of $1.12 billion, marking the highest ever for any Bitcoin ETF to date.The BlackRock Bitcoin ETF's performance across different time frames has been equally impressive. Last week alone, it observed $2.48 billion in net inflows , its most impressive weekly performance since December 2024. Meanwhile, in April, net inflows amounted to $2.69 billion despite Bitcoin's price struggles.These flows have culminated in a one-year total of over $27 billion. Interestingly, within this one year, the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF only witnessed one month of outflows, when it shed $775 million in February 2025. This consistency across timeframes shows institutional confidence in Bitcoin's long-term potential.IBIT AUM Closing in on GLDMoreover, IBIT's assets under management (AUM) have surged to $59.64 billion making it the eleventh-largest ETF in BlackRock's iShares suite, which includes over 400 funds. For context, IBIT's AUM climbed from zero at its January 2024 debut to $15 billion within just eight weeks. By October 2024, it had hit $30 billion, doing so in a record 293 days, a feat that took GLD nearly five years to achieve. This occurs despite Bitcoin's more modest YTD price increase of about 4%, compared to gold's 29%. If it continues at this pace, analysts believe IBIT could potentially overtake GLD's current AUM of $98.6 billion within the next few years.Notably, over the past month alone, IBIT's price surged by roughly 22.86%, rising from $44.98 to $55.27. Meanwhile, GLD's price climbed approximately 13.47%, moving from $274.65 to $311.64.",Market|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today|Latest BlackRock News Updates Today,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-05-07 15:35:44

Investors Expect Price Rally,https://timestabloid.com/the-next-xrp-etf-is-today-investors-expect-price-rally/,"The XRP community is abuzz with anticipation as crypto analyst JackTheRippler suggests a new XRP ETF may launch today, potentially sparking a price rally. The announcement is backed by a recently filed document that outlines the effective date of a series of ETFs, including one focused on XRP. BREAKING: The next #XRP ETF is TODAY! pic.twitter.com/1e45RnV4S1 — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) May 7, 2025 ETF Opportunities Trust and the XRP ETF The document, titled “ETF Opportunities Trust,” indicates that the filing will become effective on May 7, 2025. Among the series of ETFs listed is the “Tuttle Capital 2X Long XRP Daily Target ETF.” This filing confirms that today marks the official launch of the new XRP ETF, which is designed to offer investors leveraged exposure to the price movements of XRP. The significance of this ETF cannot be overstated, as it represents an opportunity for both institutional and retail investors to gain amplified exposure to XRP’s market performance. With the ETF structured as a “2X Long” product, it aims to generate twice the daily returns of XRP, making it particularly attractive for traders who expect bullish price movements. Implications for XRP Price The introduction of the Tuttle Capital 2X Long XRP Daily Target ETF could have a considerable impact on XRP’s price dynamics. Historically, the launch of leveraged ETFs has been associated with increased trading volume and heightened investor interest. This effect is often driven by the speculative appeal of leveraged products, which can magnify potential gains (or losses). Market sentiment around XRP has been increasingly positive, especially after recent regulatory clarity regarding its status as a non-security in certain contexts. As the ETF goes live, investors will closely monitor how the additional liquidity and trading activity influence the asset’s price. Broader Market Context The launch of the XRP ETF comes at a time when the crypto market is experiencing a resurgence in interest toward digital assets. Recent announcements of similar ETFs focused on other major cryptocurrencies, such as Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA), reflect a growing trend of institutional-grade investment vehicles entering the crypto space. The presence of these ETFs signals a maturation of the crypto market, as traditional financial products increasingly incorporate digital assets. For XRP, this ETF could catalyze broader adoption and price appreciation, especially if the product gains traction among institutional investors. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Investor Sentiment and Market Reaction JackTheRipper’s enthusiastic post underscores the community’s optimism. The XRP community, which has remained resilient despite regulatory challenges, views the ETF launch as a milestone that could help legitimize the asset within the traditional financial ecosystem. Social media sentiment has been overwhelmingly positive, with many speculating that the ETF’s introduction could mark the beginning of a new bullish phase for XRP. Analysts are keeping a close eye on trading volumes and price movements as the ETF officially goes live today. The introduction of the Tuttle Capital 2X Long XRP Daily Target ETF marks a significant moment for XRP and its community. As the ETF goes live , investors are poised to witness how this new product impacts market dynamics and whether it triggers the anticipated price rally. While the volatility of leveraged ETFs warrants caution, the potential for amplified gains has many XRP enthusiasts optimistic about the future. As always, investors should remain vigilant, balancing the potential for profit with the inherent risks of leveraged trading.

The payout was tied to the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE , a unit led by Elon to cut federal waste. The plan was simple: 20% of every dollar DOGE saved would be paid back to Americans in cash. But the numbers behind the plan have collapsed, and the criteria have narrowed so far that most taxpayers are left out. Maria Bartiromo: Given the COVID stimulus checks, how worried are you that sending a DOGE Dividend out to taxpayers is going to trigger inflation again? Me: When those COVID checks went out in 2021, we faced a supply chain crisis, a labor shortage, and widespread economic… pic.twitter.com/Qjuh13RpmD — James Fishback (@j_fishback) March 3, 2025 Musk cuts payout estimate and narrows eligibility As Cryptopolitan reported , Elon first pitched the idea expecting DOGE to save the federal government up to $2 trillion. With that projection, every taxpayer would walk away with $5,000. But that target didn’t last. On April 10, Elon told Trump that DOGE was now expected to save only $150 billion in its first fiscal year. That change dragged the possible payout down to just $375 per taxpayer, based on the same 20% return. Still, that number was later adjusted again. DOGE’s official site now shows that the expected total savings would land closer to $1,000 per taxpayer. That figure is based on a pool of 161 million taxpayers, which remains the government’s current estimate. But even if that money gets distributed, most people won’t see it. The real architect behind the check idea is James Fishback, CEO of investment firm Azoria. James pitched the concept to Elon as a way to reward people who pay more to the government than they receive in aid. “Checks would only be sent to tax-paying households,” he said. That excludes Americans with an adjusted gross income under $40,000, because most of them pay little to no federal income tax. Pew Research data backs that up. So, half the country is already off the list. James also explained that this isn’t your typical stimulus program. “Many low-income households saw transfer payments of between 25 and 30 percent of their annual income,” he said. That’s why DOGE checks would only go to net taxpayers — those who owe the IRS nothing and contribute more than they receive. “They have a lower propensity to spend and a higher propensity to save a transfer payment like the DOGE Dividend,” James said. Americans may need to temper DOGE check expectations Elon gave a speech in Wisconsin where he said that whether the checks even get sent depends on Congress and “maybe the president.” So the whole plan is still floating. The $5,000 figure is off the table. Even the $1,000 figure is now just an estimate. And nothing has been signed into law. The more people speak on this, the more watered down it becomes. Some Republicans want to kill the idea completely. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said the country should be focused on paying down the debt. “We have a $36 trillion federal debt,” Mike said. “We have a giant deficit that we’re contending with. I think we need to pay down the credit card, right?” He made it clear he doesn’t want money going out the door while the country’s financials look like this. Preston Brashers, a tax policy fellow at the Heritage Foundation, said the checks could cause a return of serious inflation. He warned it could come back “with a vengeance.” But James pushed back. He argued that as long as the DOGE checks are “deficit-financed” and funded directly from DOGE’s savings, they shouldn’t be inflationary. For now, the only thing certain is that DOGE isn’t producing a trillion-dollar windfall. Most Americans won’t get a check. And for those who do, it won’t be $5,000.",OP-ED|DOGE|Federal Reserve|USD,EN,0,0,DOGE|MINING|REGULATION|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-07 15:45:39

This data shows that actual block production consistently averages 99.7% of the expected 28,800 blocks per day. This near-perfect production rate shows the robustness of TRON’s infrastructure and demonstrates the platform’s ability to maintain high throughput and operational reliability. This performance is an improvement from the more volatile period of 2020–2021, when block production experienced periodic disruptions and fluctuations. TRON quietly hits 99.7% block production efficiency, and replaces 68% of its Super Representatives since 2020. Behind the scenes, it’s becoming one of the most stable and decentralized high-throughput blockchains. pic.twitter.com/EewbOnx8xj — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) May 7, 2025 The current consistency in block output shows a maturing network that has optimized its performance over time. With fewer large swings in daily block generation, TRON demonstrates an increasingly dependable environment for decentralized applications and transactions. TRON’s Super Representative System Key Contributor According to CryptoQuant, one key factor contributing to this performance is TRON’s Super Representative (SR) system, which plays a central role in block production under the network’s delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism. In 2025, the number of different SRs remained stable at 30, with 24 responsible for producing 3.71% of the total blocks. This closely mirrors the distribution seen in 2020, when 34 SRs were active and 17 produced a similar percentage of blocks. However, beneath this surface-level stability lies an evolving SR composition. While the total number of SRs hasn’t changed dramatically, the identities of those producing blocks have shifted. According to CryptoQuant, 23 of the 34 SRs that were active in 2020—approximately 68%—are no longer part of the block production group in 2025. This turnover has introduced 19 new SRs into the system, reflecting a dynamic, merit-based governance structure. Additionally, this steady rotation in SR roles showcases the decentralized nature of TRON’s governance. Rather than a fixed group of producers monopolizing control, the network fosters healthy competition and ongoing community engagement. The ability of new entrants to secure enough votes to become block producers shows TRON’s transparent and inclusive approach to blockchain management, reports CryptoQuant. TRON’s consistent 99.7% block production rate and evolving Super Representative structure demonstrate a secure, efficient, and decentralized platform. As TRON continues to mature, it sets a benchmark for operational reliability in the blockchain space, reinforcing its position as a high-performance network built for scalability and long-term growth.

The company is scheduled to report first-quarter results on Thursday post-market. The analysts are projecting earnings per share (EPS) falling to $1.93 from $2.26 in the fourth quarter and revenue dropping to $2.1 billion from $2.27 billion, according to FactSet data. In the year-earlier first quarter , it reported EPS of $4.40 and revenue of $1.2 billion. Trading volume is expected to land around the $403.8 billion mark vs. $439 billion in the fourth quarter. J.P. Morgan cut its EPS estimate to $1.59, citing a 10% drop in Coinbase’s trading volume and a 17% slide in total crypto market cap during the quarter. Adjusted for crypto asset losses, they see EPS at $2.39, supported in part by controlled expenses and steady subscription revenue. Barclays and Compass Point see deeper trouble. Barclays slashed its revenue and EBITDA forecasts, saying the market has cooled sharply since January despite stablecoin growth. It pegs retail volumes at $69 billion, significantly below the Street's mean estimate of $79.8 billion. Compass Point, more bearish still, downgraded the stock to sell, projecting transaction revenue of $1.24 billion, 7% below the consensus. It argues that Coinbase is losing retail share to decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and warns of further pain in the second quarter. Popular trading platform Robinhood, last week, reported a 13% drop in transaction-based revenue from the fourth quarter as markets cooled in the first three months of the year. Stablecoins to the rescue? The one area of optimism: stablecoins. Coinbase’s revenue from USDC surged as the stablecoin's market cap climbed 42% during the quarter, helping bolster subscription revenue. Barclays estimates $304 million in first-quarter USDC-related revenue, and even the skeptics at Compass Point acknowledge this helped offset falling staking income due to the slide in ether’s price. Oppenheimer cut its volume forecast to $380 billion from $440 billion, but noted that Coinbase gained U.S. spot trading market share. That’s a positive sign, but one that may not matter if retail traders keep sitting on their hands. There’s also growing concern about longer-term competitive pressures. Analysts noted that decentralized exchanges — especially those operating on faster and cheaper blockchains like Solana and Coinbase’s own Base — are drawing in retail users looking to trade a wider array of tokens. While Coinbase’s U.S. market share is up, its dominance as a centralized, regulated exchange may not be enough to fend off this shift. Looking ahead, analysts caution that a near-term rebound in trading may be slow to materialize, especially with retail traders often hesitant to re-enter the market until they recoup earlier losses. Shares of Coinbase are down 23% year-to-date, trading at $198.06, while bitcoin is up 3.8% since the beginning of the year at $97,023 .

These are averaging $1 billion per day, leading to concerns that the market comeback may stall or even reverse. Institutional participation has not led to a change in mindset, CryptoQuant says. Bitcoin ( BTC ) risks a “local top or sharp correction” if current levels of profit-taking continue, new research warns. In a “Quicktake” blog post on May 8, onchain analytics platform CryptoQuant flagged elevated realized profits among BTC investors. BTC profit-taking spikes to January highs Bitcoin realized profits have spiked to multimonth highs this week as BTC/USD reached close to $98,000. For CryptoQuant, the market is becoming comparable to late 2024, when the pair broke through old all-time highs and hit $100,000 for the first time. “Even after positive price action after March-April drop in 2025, profit taking is still aggressive. Maybe not like November-December 2024 but still high,” contributor Kripto Mevsimi wrote. “This is historically consistent with late-stage bull market behavior — where profit-taking dominates, even as price continues to rise.” Bitcoin net realized profit and loss. Source: CryptoQuant CryptoQuant data puts the current 7-day moving average realized profit across the hodler spectrum at approximately $1 billion per day. “If we look back at similar cycles (e.g. 2021), this phase often preceded a local top or sharp correction, especially when profit-taking stayed high and continuous,” it continued. No hiding from Bitcoin “investor psychology” As Cointelegraph reported , some market commentators have argued that the Bitcoin investment landscape has fundamentally changed thanks to increased institutional participation. Related: Bitcoin pushes for $98K as 2025 Fed rate cut odds flip 'pessimistic' Chief among the new players are the US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the largest of which, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), has seen net inflows every day for more than two weeks . Despite this, Kripto Mevsimi contends that underlying reactions to BTC price changes remain the same. “Since spot ETFs launched in January 2024, market structure has changed — but investor psychology hasn’t,” he summarized.

The latest market movements have caught the eye of many investors. This article explores whether these altcoins can sustain their upward trend and continue to surge. Dive in to discover the potential future of these cryptocurrencies and what might be driving their recent success. Litecoin Price Action: Strong Rise and Key Zones to Watch LTC past month gains of 30.24% and a six-month rise of 28.45% highlight Litecoin's consistent upward movement, showing a weekly increase of 7.31%. The coin has demonstrated a bullish trend, reflecting increased interest from traders and a recovery from earlier declines. Current trading is between $68.24 and $93.62, with immediate resistance at $103.74 and support around $52.98. Bulls appear to dominate but are cautious as prices near resistance. Trading within these levels may lead to gradual increases toward the second resistance at $129.12, while traders should also monitor the lower support at $27.60. Stacks (STX): Volatile Past and Mixed Present Stacks surged over 56% in the past month but experienced a steep 50.55% decline over the last six months. Price movements have been erratic, demonstrating strong short-term rebounds but also revealing significant longer-term downturns. The momentum has fluctuated unpredictably, showcasing both aggressive rallies and heavy dips that characterize its performance history. The current trading range is between $0.55 and $1.00, with resistance at $1.20 and support around $0.29. Indicators like a 60.76 RSI suggest cautious optimism, although there is slight negative momentum indicating bearish pressure. Traders may look to buy near support levels and test the $1.20 resistance to assess potential trend reversal opportunities. Conclusion LTC and STX have seen significant daily gains, sparking interest among investors. The recent performance suggests a potential for continued upward movement. However, market conditions and investor sentiment will play crucial roles. Monitoring market trends and news is essential for predicting future price actions.

The chance of regulatory acceptance for Solana ETF in 2025 drives its price towards reaching $200. The Shiba Inu token surpasses previous resistance zones and expert analysts expect it to rise 124%. Meanwhile, the presale initiative of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has attracted $7.6 million and succeeded in selling over 443 million tokens to 9,500 holders. The projects receive increased interest because of their distinct advantages which demonstrate significant investment opportunities. Solana’s Bullish Momentum The SOL token price on Solana (SOL) continues to advance toward $200 by building on its previous 20% market boost within a month. At present SOL maintains support between $135 and $140 as well as at $140 and trades above $150. The increased market interest rate shows through trading volume increases of 34.61% to reach $3.39 billion. Analysts at Rose Premium Signals project a $280 target, driven by Solana’s technical breakout within an ascending channel. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 58 suggests room for growth without overbought risks. An 80% likelihood of ETF approval in 2025 further bolsters confidence. Compared to other tokens, Solana’s infrastructure outshines, but its volatility demands caution. This momentum seamlessly transitions to Shiba Inu’s speculative allure. Shiba Inu’s breakout potential Shiba Inu (SHIB) is shaking off bearish trends, climbing to $0.0000135 after breaching two descending trendlines from 2024. Analysts forecast a 124% rally to $0.00003 by May 2025, supported by bullish signals from the WaveTrend Oscillator and RSI at 64.47. However, recent activity, with 150 billion tokens offloaded, introduces volatility. SHIB faces resistance at $0.0000142-$0.0000145, with support at $0.0000126-$0.0000128. While SHIB’s meme-driven hype fuels short-term gains, its lack of utility pales against more structured projects. This speculative energy contrasts with Mutuum Finance’s calculated approach, now under the spotlight. Mutuum Finance’s presale surge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is accelerating through phase 4 of its presale, with 57% of tokens sold at $0.025. Having raised $7.6 million and attracted 9,400 holders, the project is witnessing intense demand. Phase 5 looms, bringing a 20% price hike to $0.03, offering current investors a 20% gain. The tokenomics project a 140% return at the $0.06 listing price, while analysts predict a post-launch surge to $2.50, yielding a 9,900% ROI. Recently, the team launched a dashboard showcasing the top 50 holders, and are set to reward them with bonus tokens for maintaining their ranks. This innovative move is sparking further interest. Security and growth focus The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team is prioritizing trust, actively pursuing a smart contract audit with Certik. Once finalized, the announcement will hit their social channels, reinforcing investor confidence. The project’s lending model, built on overcollateralized loans, ensures stability, unlike the speculative swings of other tokens. Early investors are locking in tokens at the lowest price, driven by FOMO as phase 4 nears completion. The structured presale pricing and buy-and-distribute mechanism create constant demand, setting Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart from less grounded projects. This focus on sustainability flows into its long-term potential. Long-term DeFi promise Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is carving a niche in DeFi with practical utility. Its mtTokens, like mtETH for ETH deposits, accrue interest, offering passive income. The platform’s peer-to-peer lending and dynamic interest rates cater to diverse investors. Unlike Solana’s infrastructure play or Shiba Inu’s meme-driven spikes, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) balances accessibility and stability. The presale’s rapid sell-out signals strong market faith, with tokens poised for significant post-launch gains. Investors are acting swiftly to secure positions before prices climb. This structured growth ties directly to the smart money narrative. Riding the crypto wave Smart money is targeting Solana (SOL), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for their distinct strengths. Solana’s ETF prospects and Shiba Inu’s breakout potential offer short-term excitement, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out with its DeFi utility and 9,900% ROI potential. The crypto market rewards early movers, and these tokens are drawing sharp-eyed investors. Research these projects thoroughly and consider joining the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale to capitalize on phase 4’s low entry price. Act now to explore these opportunities before the market shifts.

44284733,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=746032,1746633606,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/44284733.jpeg,"Bitcoin Poised To Retest All-Time High If This Level Holds, Says Bitfinex",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-retest-all-time-high-if-this-level-holds/,"Bitcoin’s resurgence in April has positioned it for a potential breakout toward its all-time high—provided one key technical level continues to hold. That’s the core takeaway from the latest Bitfinex Alpha report, which offers a data-rich breakdown of BTC’s recent market dynamics and the underlying structural forces that may guide its trajectory as macroeconomic pressures persist. Bitcoin Eyes All-Time High The report, dated May 5, 2025, reveals that Bitcoin closed April with a 14.08% monthly gain, outperforming both its historical average return of 13% and the median return of 7.3% for the month. The rebound is particularly significant given the market’s early-April volatility, which saw Bitcoin plunge 32% from its all-time high of $109,590 to a low of $74,501—marking the steepest correction of the current cycle. This sharp downturn, intensified by macroeconomic headwinds such as trade tensions, appeared to signal a deeper structural breakdown. Yet, what followed was an aggressive recovery that Bitfinex analysts argue is indicative of a resilient and well-supported market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Network Activity In Bear Market Zone—Warning Or Opportunity? “Bitcoin has shown notable resilience relative to other risk assets,” the report notes, underscoring that the price has surged more than 32% from its April lows to local highs of $97,900. This rally, however, now faces a critical test: whether BTC can reclaim and sustain the $95,000 level, which Bitfinex identifies as “a critical pivot point, acting as the lower boundary of a three-month range that defined market structure between November 2024 and February 2025.” The report emphasizes that holding above this threshold is not just a matter of sentiment but of structural significance. A successful consolidation above $95,000 would, according to the analysts, signal a shift back into bullish territory and could pave the way for a retest of the $109,590 all-time high. Failure to do so, however, “could turn the region into resistance once more,” with implications of a renewed correction. Key to the current bullish thesis is Bitcoin’s short-term holder (STH) cost basis, which Bitfinex places at $93,340. This metric—representing the average acquisition price of coins held by recent market entrants—has historically served as a dividing line between bullish and bearish phases. “The ability to reclaim and now consolidate within this zone is an encouraging sign,” the report states, noting that sustained price action above this level would likely “convert this range into a new support base, reinforcing bullish sentiment.” Related Reading: Raoul Pal: Bitcoin Could Hit $450,000 In Liquidity-Driven Supercycle Bitfinex underscores that “the significance of this level cannot be overstated.” If BTC remains above the STH cost basis, it would prevent a large cohort of recent buyers from slipping back into unrealised losses—an outcome that could otherwise intensify sell pressure. As the report succinctly frames it: “The next few sessions will be crucial in determining whether this reclaim is the foundation of a new leg higher—or merely a local top.” Why BTC Looks Strong Beyond price levels and technical patterns, the report delves into on-chain data, offering a window into the conviction of long-term network participants. Miner reserves, a bellwether of internal market confidence, have remained strikingly stable. From December 2024 to May 2025, reserves rose marginally from 1,808,315 BTC to 1,808,674 BTC. Such stability, Bitfinex argues, “strongly suggests a deliberate holding strategy,” particularly given that miners often need to liquidate holdings to cover operational costs. Their continued restraint is interpreted as a signal of longer-term bullish expectations. This miner behaviour gains further validation from the Puell Multiple, a widely observed profitability metric. The indicator, which compares daily miner revenues against the 365-day average, remains well below the 2.0 threshold that historically coincides with major sell-offs and local market tops. “Miners, by nature and necessity, are some of the most disciplined participants in the ecosystem,” Bitfinex reminds its readers. Their decision to continue holding through Bitcoin’s recent 32% recovery lends further credence to the thesis that the current rally is not merely reactive, but structurally supported. In sum, the Bitfinex Alpha report positions the current BTC market as one defined by critical thresholds and cautious optimism. While the recovery from the April lows has been rapid and technically impressive, all eyes are now on the $93,340 to $95,000 range. If Bitcoin can maintain support above this zone, the report argues, it may have the structural footing necessary to resume its upward trajectory and test its all-time high. At press time, BTC traded at $96,923.

ADA Price Struggles While BNB Shows Progress As 2025’s market gains momentum, the difference between rising and slowing crypto projects is getting clearer. ADA has faced pullbacks following a series of major asset sell-offs, while BNB strengthens its ecosystem by backing new projects directly. Meanwhile, Cold Wallet , now priced at $0.00714, is being recognized as one of the three standout crypto platforms with high potential heading into 2025. ADA Slips as Selling Pressure Mounts ADA has recently led a downward trend in altcoins, dropping over 4% in a single session per CoinDesk. This dip came on the heels of a broader round of Bitcoin profit-taking that rippled across the crypto sector. Uncertainty also grew after ProShares filed a revised XRP ETF proposal, pushing traders to the sidelines. Though ADA is built on solid fundamentals and aims to support decentralized solutions long-term, it’s lagging in real adoption metrics. Its on-chain activity and DeFi growth haven’t matched that of other networks, which has led to doubts about its staying power. Analysts are noting ADA’s inability to stay above critical price supports, and current volume data shows that both retail and institutional interest have weakened. While the tech is solid, ADA needs a stronger story to regain traction in 2025. BNB Chain Pushes Forward with Ecosystem Growth BNB is taking steps to strengthen its position with a renewed $100 million fund for ecosystem support. As reported by DL News, this new approach includes directly funding promising projects, allowing BNB Chain to guide growth more deliberately. This strategy is meant to move beyond quick incentives and create deeper relationships with builders. BNB’s role in Web3 and decentralized finance continues to expand, making it one of the most used platforms in the space. While its price hasn’t surged recently, BNB’s groundwork hints at future gains as market sentiment improves. By supporting strong platforms with adaptable capital, BNB is laying a solid foundation for future relevance in growing Web3 applications. Cold Wallet Becomes a High-Growth Contender in 2025 Unlike legacy platforms caught in market cycles, Cold Wallet is gaining strong traction for offering early access at a game-changing rate. With its crypto presale currently live at $0.00714 and launch value set at $0.3517, it promises a potential 4,900% return. But this project is more than just numbers, it delivers real cross-chain usability and full user control in a privacy-first environment. Users benefit from noncustodial storage with easy access to Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, and Polygon, without depending on outside services or technical steps. The core of Cold Wallet is its utility-rich coin, CWT, which drives reduced fees, exclusive access, and active governance. Rather than sitting idle, CWT gives users access to premium features and voting rights in a fully functioning DAO system. The roadmap is already unfolding, including loyalty tiers, launchpad integration, governance tools, and more. This makes Cold Wallet a powerful pick for those who want consistent platform benefits, not just passive access. Its token structure is also carefully designed. 40% of the total supply is reserved for the ongoing presale, giving early access at a major discount. 30% is set aside for DAO and participation rewards, ensuring a fair and active community. Another 15% will be used to fund platform upgrades and security infrastructure. The final 15% is dedicated to the team and strategic partners, all with vesting schedules to maintain accountability. Final Thoughts! ADA, once a market favorite, is still searching for its next breakthrough. BNB keeps improving steadily, proving its utility through quiet expansion. But Cold Wallet stands in a different league, delivering unmatched early-stage access, real functionality, and long-term reward systems. It’s rare to see a project blend decentralization, practical use, and such a strong upside. With its $0.00714 stage 2 presale, Cold Wallet is quickly becoming the go-to platform for users wanting privacy, control, and participation in a growing network.

While Chainlink (LINK) price struggles to break past $15 and whales back off, and the BNB ETF buzz heats up after VanEck’s filing, a less-talked-about player is pulling serious numbers under the radar. BlockDAG just crossed 1 million users on its mobile mining app, X1, while its presale holds firm at just $0.0019 per coin. And here’s where it gets interesting: users are already stacking BDAG daily through the app, before the listing shoots the price up to $0.05 or even higher. This is no hype, it’s a limited window. Thousands are already mining daily, miss this now, and you could be buying BDAG at $1 instead. Could this be the next big crypto? BlockDAG X1 App – Nifty Tool to Stack Up on BDAG BlockDAG’s mobile miner, the X1 app, has now crossed 1 million users, and for good reason. At a time when most mining requires expensive rigs, BlockDAG has turned smartphones into passive BDAG earners. The app is lightweight, works on both iOS and Android, and lets users mine BDAG daily with no technical setup. It’s fast becoming the easiest way for anyone to get into crypto accumulation, even before launch. On the presale side, BDAG is still available for just $0.0019, but only until May 13. After that, prices will reset to batch 28 levels of $0.0262 per BDAG. Over 19.7 billion coins have already been sold across 28 batches, raising more than $227.5 million. The Buyer Battle system also distributes 25 million BDAG daily to top buyers, while a 5% referral bonus boosts accumulation potential. BlockDAG’s hybrid tech combines Proof-of-Work with DAG architecture, allowing faster confirmations and low fees. The beta testnet is already live, processing 800+ TPS, and the network has been audited by CertiK and Halborn. Major partnerships with Inter Milan and UFC’s Alex Pereira are driving visibility, while the X1 Miner app forms the entry point for thousands joining daily. If you’re wondering what is the next big crypto, the answer might already be in your pocket. With listings coming soon and mining rewards still live, BlockDAG is giving early users a head start. Thousands are already mining daily, miss this now, and you could be buying BDAG at $1 instead. Chainlink (LINK) Price Faces $15 Wall Again The Chainlink (LINK) price is stuck between $13 and $15, with $15 proving to be a strong resistance. After a 3.55% dip, LINK is trading around $13.64 as of May 5, 2025. Bulls have struggled to hold ground, with over $2.2 million in long liquidations in late April alone. Whale activity has dropped sharply, from $98.64 million on April 28 to just $21.12 million by May 3, pointing to reduced interest from large holders. The Chainlink (LINK) price chart shows a trend of lower highs and lower lows. If it fails to hold $13, analysts warn it could slide toward $10.50. Despite this, trading volume is up 23.85% in the last 24 hours, which could mean some traders are buying the dip. A confirmed breakout above $15 could flip the trend, possibly pushing LINK to $17.50, but for now, the market remains on edge and driven by liquidation volatility. BNB ETF Buzz Lifts Price Toward $600 The BNB ETF filing by VanEck has put Binance Coin back in the spotlight. BNB is now trading around $594.14 after touching $596 earlier in the day. While other major coins stall, BNB has shown steady strength, holding above its 2024 lows. Trading volume is up more than 14% to $1.43 billion in the past 24 hours, showing growing interest as the market reacts to the ETF news. VanEck submitted an S-1 to the SEC to launch a spot BNB ETF, which could include staking rewards through trusted providers. This marks the first formal move to get a BNB-based ETF approved in the US. The filing comes after VanEck’s previous listings of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs and shows a clear intent to expand further into altcoins. If approved, this ETF could drive new inflows and push BNB toward the $1,000 mark, especially with regulatory sentiment softening under the Trump administration. Key Insights Chainlink (LINK) price is still struggling to break $15, with liquidations and whale pullbacks adding pressure. Meanwhile, Binance Coin is getting a boost from the BNB ETF filing by VanEck, which could open the door to institutional flows and push prices toward four digits if approved. Both assets are in focus, but there’s a different kind of momentum building quietly elsewhere. BlockDAG is running one of the biggest presales in 2025, already raising over $227.5 million with BDAG priced at just $0.0019 until May 13. The X1 app, now used by more than a million people, lets anyone mine BDAG right from their phone. As listings approach, the question isn’t just what is the next big crypto , it’s whether you’re already mining it.

Analyst: ""Two Indicators That Previously Brought Rally Are Sending Signals!""",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-bull-rally-could-be-imminent-analyst-two-indicators-that-previously-brought-rally-are-sending-signals/,"While Bitcoin had a weak performance in the first quarter of 2025, it is experiencing a strong recovery after the first week of April. At this point, Bitcoin rose above $97,000 again following news that the US and China will resume tariff talks. While moving at $96,000 levels ahead of the critical FED decision, market analyst Omkar Godbole said that the Bitcoin chart indicates an upward trend. According to the analyst, Bitcoin is showing similar technical patterns to those that preceded its late-2024 rally. MACD Indicator! Analyzing the popular MACD indicator, which is primarily used to identify trend reversals and reversals, the analyst points to a possible bullish reversal, with the golden cross of the MACD and moving averages likely to form soon. On this point, the analyst noted that Bitcoin price initially fell after the MACD turned negative in mid-February but quickly found support at the 50-week SMA in March and has since bounced back above $90,000. Stating that this situation reflects last August and September, the analyst noted that the MACD switched to an upward trend in mid-October and resulted in a rise from $ 70,000 to $ 100,000 by December. 50 and 200 Day Averages! Secondly, examining the 50- and 200-day SMAs, the analyst said, “The two averages formed a death cross about four weeks ago, indicating a bearish trend, but this turned out to be a bear trap. Bitcoin found support around $75,000 and changed direction.” At this point, the analyst states that the 50-day SMA has recently started to rise again and may soon rise above the 200-day SMA, forming a golden cross indicating an upward trend in the coming weeks. Stating that this situation also reflects the trend of the past year, the analyst said, “The death cross intersection in August created a bottom, which was immediately followed by a golden intersection that started a rise above $ 70,000 and eventually led to a rise above $ 109,000, reaching new highs.” As a result, the analyst notes that while history does not guarantee future results, indicators on the Bitcoin chart point to a possible rally in the coming months and BTC could reach new ATHs. *This is not investment advice.

Recently, the price of SOL went up and got close to $150, but it couldn’t break through and was pushed back down. This caused a drop in some key on-chain metrics, as investors started diverting their investment. Experts believe that if the Fed lowers interest rates, it could help the market recover and reduce the current selling pressure for SOL. Solana’s Network Activity Plunges Hard Solana has been going through a period of high price swings in the last several hours. After failing to stay above the $150 mark, a large wave of liquidations took place, according to data from Coinglass. In the past 24 hours, over $7 million in Solana positions were wiped out. Of that, about $1.61 million came from buyers who were betting on prices going up (long positions), while sellers closed around $5.42 million worth of positions. One reason Solana’s price is struggling to rise is the decline in network activity. Data from The Block shows that the number of active addresses on Solana has fallen sharply in recent weeks: from a high of 4.12 million to a low of 3.31 million. The number of new addresses has also taken a hit, dropping from 4.11 million to 3.2 million. This overall decline in usage is making it harder for Solana to break through its current price resistance. Also read: Solana Price Prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030: SOL Price Targets $500 Next? The market is now closely watching today’s U.S. Federal Reserve meeting, which could bring new volatility. While Donald Trump’s recent comments have sparked positive hope, the CME FedWatch Tool shows only a 2.3% chance of a rate cut happening today. Most experts expect the Fed to keep interest rates steady at 4.25% to 4.50%. If the Fed cuts rates, Solana could jump above $150. If rates stay the same, SOL will likely keep moving sideways within its current trend. What’s Next for SOL Price? Solana is currently getting support around the 20-day EMA, showing that buyers are stepping in during price dips. However, bears are strongly defending a push above the resistance of $150-$160. As of writing, SOL price trades at $145.8, surging over 1.4% in the last 24 hours. SOLUSDT Chart Buyers are likely to try pushing the price above the $150 resistance again. If they succeed, SOL could climb to $180. This will create a broad trading range within $110 and $215. On the other hand, if sellers manage to push the price below the 20-day EMA, SOL might drop toward the $133 level. In that case, the price could stay stuck between $105 and $150 for some time. The long/short chart for Solana shows a noticeable drop in the ratio, now sitting at 0.5122. This means about 66% of traders are betting that SOL’s price will continue to fall.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Solana,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-07 16:02:53

Here’s The Implication,https://timestabloid.com/whales-accumulate-1-8-billion-in-xrp-heres-the-implication/,"In a remarkable demonstration of confidence, XRP whales have reportedly accumulated approximately 900 million XRP tokens, valued at over $1.8 billion, within the last 30 days. This massive accumulation, highlighted by crypto analyst Xaif on X , has sparked conversations within the cryptocurrency community regarding the potential implications for XRP’s future price movements. The move by these large holders indicates a strategic shift and hints at a potentially bullish outlook for the digital asset. BREAKING Whales Accumulate $1.8 Billion in $XRP in 30 Days WE'RE SO BACK pic.twitter.com/xr3CORnWpT — 𝕏aif | (@Xaif_Crypto) May 6, 2025 Understanding Whale Accumulation Whale accumulation refers to a pattern where large-scale investors, often institutional players or individuals holding significant amounts of cryptocurrency, increase their holdings over a short period. In the case of XRP, wallets containing between 10 million and 100 million tokens have been the most active, leading to a significant increase in the total number of XRP held by large wallets. Reports indicate that over 300,000 wallets now hold at least 10,000 XRP each, marking a substantial rise in whale activity. This surge in accumulation is not a spontaneous event but is likely a calculated strategy by investors anticipating favorable developments within the XRP ecosystem. The phenomenon of whale accumulation is often viewed as a positive indicator, as it suggests that well-capitalized and presumably well-informed investors are positioning themselves for a potential price increase. Historically, such trends have preceded upward price movements, as a reduced circulating supply can create upward pressure when demand remains steady or rises. Market Sentiment and Investor Confidence One of the primary reasons behind this aggressive accumulation could be the growing confidence in XRP’s long-term potential. Despite ongoing legal challenges, including the protracted Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit, XRP has managed to retain substantial market interest. The recent settlement speculation has added to positive sentiment, fostering a sense of stability within the community. Moreover, the recent surge in whale activity correlates with favorable macroeconomic factors and strategic moves by Ripple Labs. For instance, Ripple’s acquisition of prime broker Hidden Road for $1.25 billion signifies a push towards consolidating its presence in institutional markets. This acquisition is viewed as a pivotal move that may bolster liquidity and the adoption of XRP, particularly in cross-border payments. The Role of Market Dynamics XRP’s recent price action has also contributed to whale accumulation. After stabilizing around the $2 mark, XRP has shown resilience against broader market volatility. Analysts point out that the cryptocurrency’s ability to maintain this level despite macroeconomic uncertainties demonstrates underlying strength. Such performance likely motivates long-term holders to increase their positions, confident that the downside risk remains limited. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Technical analysis further supports the notion of an impending breakout. Indicators like the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggest that XRP is on the verge of a significant move. The Bollinger Bands, which have recently shown a squeeze pattern, indicate reduced volatility and the potential for a sharp price shift. Given these technical signals, whales accumulating at this juncture may be preparing for a bullish scenario. Potential Impact on XRP Price The strategic behavior of whales has historically been a precursor to notable price movements. By accumulating a significant amount of XRP, these investors reduce the available supply on exchanges, potentially triggering a supply-demand imbalance. Should retail interest surge concurrently, XRP could experience a rapid price increase, particularly if it manages to break key resistance levels, such as $2.26. However, investors must remain cautious. While whale accumulation is generally perceived as a bullish signal, it does not guarantee a price rally. Market conditions, including regulatory developments and macroeconomic shifts, could still influence the trajectory of XRP. Therefore, while optimism abounds, prudent risk management remains essential. The accumulation of $1.8 billion worth of XRP by whales within a month signals renewed confidence in the digital asset’s future. As highlighted by analyst Xaif, this trend underscores a potential market shift that could shape XRP’s short- to mid-term outlook. Whether this accumulation will lead to sustained price growth or a brief speculative spike remains uncertain. Nonetheless, the presence of whale interest indicates that major players are positioning themselves strategically, anticipating that XRP may soon play a more significant role in the evolving crypto landscape.

Alongside Bitcoin (BTC), XRP is one of the only top 5 cryptocurrencies to post gains in 2025. Much of this strength stems from the U.S. SEC’s decision to drop its appeals against Ripple in the high-profile case over the sale of unregistered securities to the public. Analyst Steph is Crypto recently shared a straightforward XRP price prediction , outlining the token’s typical bearish and bullish cycles. Following the latest consolidation phase, the trader expects a major breakout – potentially sending XRP to the $12 level in the near future. This is the most bullish #XRP chart I've ever seen… pic.twitter.com/juCxT1Gdss — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) April 30, 2025 Meanwhile, in a report published on Sunday, the company also highlighted that institutional adoption of XRP has been accelerating as reflected by multiple exchange-traded funds (ETFs) applications being filed by top asset management firms and the upcoming launch of XRP futures by the CME Group. Meanwhile, exchange-traded products (ETPs) linked to the token took in record inflows of $37.7 million during the first quarter of 2025 and have accumulated $214 million in inflows since the year started. Strong retail interest and faster-than-expected institutional adoption could push XRP back to its all-time high as market sentiment continues to improve. Daily Price Action Shows Big Upside Potential Ahead for XRP An Elliott Wave analysis of the latest price action shows a favorable setup that could propel XRP to $7 in the next few weeks. The fifth Elliott Wave would deliver higher gains compared to the first wave, which took place in November last year when President Trump was elected and Ripple won its case against the SEC. If the price rises above the $3.6 level, this would confirm a bullish outlook. Based on this projection, XRP offers significant upside potential in the mid-term. The next bullish catalyst that could push the token to these higher levels could come from the Federal Reserve in the form of an unexpected interest rate cut. Momentum indicators in the daily chart have been trending lower lately as the recent rally has cooled down. However, as long as XRP stays above its 200-day EMA, as it has in the past few months, the token’s long-term outlook is bullish. While XRP holds above key support, early-stage presales like MIND of Pepe are also gaining traction – offering strong upside as the market recovers. MIND of Pepe (MIND) Raises $8.8M to Launch a Powerful AI Agent MIND of Pepe (MIND) combines the popularity of the Pepe the Frog meme with an advanced artificial intelligence model to create a character that is poised to captivate social media users across platforms like X. Just a few months after its launch, its presale event has raised nearly $9 million and is now just a few days away from wrapping up. As MIND of Pepe interacts with high-profile accounts and users, it will collect actionable insights and social trends that it will share exclusively with $MIND holders so they can take advantage of the latest opportunities in the meme coin space. In addition, as its influence grows, the agent will launch its own meme coins to capitalize on these trends. $MIND holders will get early access to these new tokens to reap the highest returns once they are launched to the general public. To buy $MIND, simply head to the MIND of Pepe website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH or use a bank card to make your investment.

LPL Financial Chief Economist Jeffrey Roach said in an assessment he made on the Yahoo Finance program Morning Brief that this week’s meeting will most likely be “boring.” Roach said that Fed officials will prepare markets for the first rate cut in June with domestic and international speeches they will make during this process. Roach said he expects three interest rate cuts during the year, adding that these could be quarter-point cuts in June, October and December, respectively. He noted that there are positive signals, especially in non-housing services inflation, which is called “super core.” Roach also made assessments of employment data, stating that the latest figures do not fully reflect the truth and that some temporary hirings (such as in the warehousing sector) make the picture look stronger than it is. He also pointed out that the data could be misleading because federal employees are still on the payroll due to severance pay or early retirement. Related News: Binance Releases Its 30th Reserve Proof Report - Here Are the Exchange's Bitcoin and Altcoin Holdings However, Roach said that the persistent demand for labor in the health sector provides stability to the labor market, and that the general trend is a slowdown in employment growth over the last year and a half but still positive. He added that as long as the average employment growth remains above 125,000, the message of stability will continue to be given to the markets. Roach said that businesses tend to hold on to their current employees because of the difficulties they face in finding qualified workers, and that this could limit layoffs. However, he also noted that wage increases could slow down. Noting that there has been a rapid increase in the number of people unemployed for a long time, Roach added that this rate has reached pre-pandemic levels but does not yet show signs of recession. For this reason, he stated that the markets reacted positively to the employment data announced last Friday. According to Roach's assessment, the Fed will not change interest rates this week, but will begin to lay the groundwork for a possible cut in June. *This is not investment advice.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) climbed to $97,650 on Wednesday, up 30% from its lowest point this year. This latest rally has pushed Bitcoin’s market dominance to 65.70%, its highest level since January 2021. The dominance rose as many altcoins, especially Ethereum ( ETH ) continued to underperform the market. Ethereum’s market dominance has fallen to 7.5% from a peak of 22.27% in 2022. Its price is at risk of dropping to a record low against Bitcoin . Bitcoin dominance has strengthened because BTC remains just a few points below its all-time high, while most altcoins are down significantly from their 2024 peaks. For instance, Ripple (XRP) has fallen by over 37%, while Cardano ( ADA ), Solana ( SOL ), and Tron ( TRX ) have slumped by over 50%, 51%, and 45% from their November highs. Wall Street demand has played a crucial role in supporting Bitcoin. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen strong inflows, with assets under management exceeding $111 billion and more than $40 billion in accumulated inflows.

It remains above the 50-week and 100-week moving averages, while the Average Directional Index has climbed to 43. An ADX above 25 generally signals strong bullish momentum. However, the dominance has also formed a rising wedge pattern, while its Relative Strength Index has moved to the overbought level at 74.10. This is a sign that the dominance will have a reversal soon as investors rotate to altcoins. This rotation will likely happen when the dominance hits 72.92%, its highest level in December 2022.

Altcoins have also completed much of the bullish harmonic XABCD pattern and are now forming the final CD leg.

Many are wondering if these digital assets have the potential to hit record-breaking values by 2025. Stay tuned to discover which of these coins are gearing up for a possible surge and what factors might drive their growth. Quant QNT Surge: Strong Gains and Key Levels Set the Stage Quant demonstrated sustained upward progress with a one-month increase of 34.57% and a six-month gain of 39.33%. The coin recorded a notable 15.73% rise over the past week, consistently staying within a range of $63.20 to $82.20. This performance reflects a strong positive trend and robust market sentiment among traders. Current pricing is marked by nearest support at $51.40 and resistance at $89.40, with a second support at $32.40 and a second resistance at $108.40. Bulls appear in control as momentum indicators, including an RSI of 64.98, point to continued buying interest. This suggests trades that capitalize on pullbacks towards key support during upward moves. Algorand: Steady Long-Term Growth Meets Key Price Levels Over the last month, Algorand rose by about 25%, and over the past six months it surged by more than 60%. The coin showed volatility within this period, with short-term retracements balanced by a solid long-term upward move. These gains reflect increasing investor interest and stronger market demand. Current trading sees prices moving between $0.1643 and $0.2570. Resistance sits at $0.2944, while support holds at $0.1088. Bulls have pushed the price upward, yet moving averages and momentum indicators suggest caution. Traders may look for opportunities to play within the range, targeting swings near these clear technical levels. Conclusion Both QNT and ALGO show potential for growth by 2025. They each bring unique strengths to the market. QNT focuses on interoperability, while ALGO aims for transaction efficiency. Market trends and technological developments will play key roles in their performance. If they continue to innovate and gain adoption, new all-time highs are possible for these tokens.

The next move could determine whether the uptrend continues or collapses. Fartcoin (FART) has seen an aggressive 10% drop over the past 24 hours, shaking out recent lows and landing directly on a high-probability support zone. This level, centered around $0.91, is technically significant, not only as a daily support area, but also as a macro higher low in the broader uptrend structure. The confluence of indicators at this zone makes it a “make or break” moment for the continuation of bullish momentum. Key technical points Critical Support at $0.91: This area marks the higher low in the ongoing macro uptrend and now acts as a key battleground. Fibonacci & VWAPSR Confluence: The 0.618 Fib retracement, the VWAP support region, and a swept swing low all converge at this price. Low Volume Warning: While structure remains intact, continued low volume at support raises the risk of a breakdown without buying confirmation. FartCoinUSDT (4H) Chart, Source: TradingView Technical analysis Fartcoin’s recent move brings it into direct contact with the $0.91 support zone, a level now holding structural importance for determining the next leg of this market cycle. This zone aligns precisely with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement from the last impulse, as well as the VWAP support region, which reflects buyer interest from previous higher prices. You might also like: TRON pumps USDT, ADA waits on bulls; BlockDAG’s $0.0019 entry closes in just 6 days Adding to the technical weight of this level is its alignment with a recently swept swing low. That move likely triggered stop-loss orders and may serve as a liquidity grab, a common precursor to bullish reversals, if accompanied by a volume uptick. So far, however, trading volume remains light, signaling hesitancy among buyers. That needs to change quickly for the bullish case to remain valid. If this zone is defended, the next logical target would be a rotation toward $1.29, the last swing high. But if $0.91 gives way and the support collapses, Fartcoin would break its macro higher low structure—triggering a potential trend reversal and deeper drawdown. What to expect in the coming price action Fartcoin’s 10% slide into stacked support is a moment of truth. A bullish reaction backed by rising volume could initiate a rebound toward $1.29. But failure here would mark a break in market structure and likely lead to further downside.

Currently in phase 4 at $0.025, the presale phase is 60% filled, with phase 5 looming, promising a 20% price hike to $0.03. Investors are flocking to this DeFi project, drawn by its lending model and projected 140% return at a $0.06 listing. Can PEPE’s viral hype or SHIB’s loyal base outpace MUTM’s calculated ascent in 2025? The crypto market awaits the verdict. Pepe (PEPE) rides meme momentum Trading at roughly $0.00000787, Pepe (PEPE) thrives on meme-driven energy. Its 1,744% surge in 2024 showcases its knack for capturing retail frenzy. Forecasts suggest a 2025 range of $0.000019 to $0.000045, a potential 2x to 6x gain. A feverish bull run could push it to $0.0001, but PEPE’s reliance on social media spikes makes it a risky bet. Without tangible utility, its price sways with sentiment, leaving investors vulnerable to sharp dips. PEPE’s smaller market cap offers room for growth, yet its speculative nature demands caution. Can it sustain its fiery run against more grounded rivals? Shiba Inu (SHIB) banks on stability Shiba Inu (SHIB), a meme coin veteran, trades near $0.000013, down from its 2024 peak of $0.000033. Its double-bottom pattern at $0.00001072 hints at a bullish 2025, with projections of $0.00003 to $0.00006, a 2x to 5x rise. SHIB’s Shibarium network and loyal community provide a steadier foundation than PEPE’s volatility. Still, its high token supply caps explosive gains, appealing to those favoring gradual growth. SHIB’s challenge lies in reigniting fervor to match its 2021 glory. Its dependable base keeps it relevant, but can it outshine a DeFi upstart? Mutuum Finance (MUTM) forges ahead Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is charging through phase 4 of its presale, with 60% of tokens at $0.025 already claimed. The imminent phase 5 will lift prices by 20% to $0.03, offering current buyers a swift gain. Tokenomics guarantee a 140% return at the $0.06 listing, with analysts eyeing a $2.50 post-launch target in 2025, a 9,900% leap. The team is auditing its smart contracts with Certik, with results soon to be shared on social platforms, bolstering trust. A new dashboard tracks the top 50 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) holders, rewarding them with bonus tokens for holding firm. This gamified loyalty program fuels engagement, driving demand. The project’s lending model, blending peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer systems, empowers users to earn passive income or borrow against collateral. Unlike PEPE and SHIB’s hype-driven models, MUTM’s utility anchors its value, attracting investors seeking stability. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s buy-and-distribute system recycles platform fees into token buybacks, redistributing them to stakers. This creates steady demand, shielding against sell-offs. With $7.7 million raised, phase 4’s rapid sell-out signals fierce interest. Investors joining now secure a prime entry before the $0.03 hike. MUTM’s structured growth outshines PEPE’s erratic surges and SHIB’s slower climb. Deciding the crypto champion Pepe (PEPE) tempts with quick gains but falters on utility. Shiba Inu (SHIB) offers reliability yet struggles for breakout momentum. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) blends DeFi innovation with presale urgency, positioning it to eclipse both in 2025. Its $2.50 target and 140% listing return make it a standout. Investors eyeing the next big move should research Mutuum Finance (MUTM) now, as phase 4 dwindles.

Tokens under Binance’s Monitoring Tag face closer scrutiny and 90-day risk assessments. Affected tokens show significant price drops, with Movement (MOVE) losing 34.96% in seven days. Binance is placing six more crypto tokens : Stella (ALPHA), Hifi Finance (HIFI), LeverFi (LEVER), Movement (MOVE), Portal (PORTAL), and Rei Network (REI) under its “Monitoring Tag” today, May 7, 2025. The exchange states this decision is driven by recent developments concerning these assets and is part of its ongoing commitment to platform integrity and user protection.

Excessive investor demand demonstrates their confident stance towards the project. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) targets dominance against established leaders Cardano (ADA) and Chainlink (LINK) while approaching the upcoming phase 5 price increase to $0.03. The lending model together with its buy pressure system confirms projections of substantial development in the anticipated crypto market of 2025. Surging Presale Success The fourth phase of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale enjoys significant investor excitement leading to the rapid token sales. The current selling price of $0.025 leads to quick token depletion with phase 4 now 57% sold out. People who invest now in phase 4 will receive a 20% elevation of value because the price will boost to $0.03. The tokenomics data shows that at launch date the token price will be $0.06 which provides potential investors with a return of 140%. The post-launch projections from certain authorities indicate that MUTM can reach $2.50 resulting in a spectacular 9,900% ROI. The platform MUTM created a new dashboard to display leaderboards ranking the top 50 users who would receive bonus tokens based on their position maintenance. Robust Lending Innovation Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has chosen security as its main direction by implementing a smart contract audit through Certik. Social platform disclosure of audit results will occur when the finalization process ends to enhance community trust. Within its decentralized lending system users gain the freedom to participate in borrowing activities and lending activities and earn income without effort. Speculative tokens do not benefit from its stability-promoting mechanism which relies on overcollateralization. A USDT borrowing operation of $5,000 needs $7,000 worth of ETH collateral to safeguard lenders. The repurchase system from the buy-and-distribute mechanism provides further support to demand through token purchases from stakers. The platform follows a different structure than others for ADA implementation which leads to natural progression into addressing Cardano’s (ADA) challenges. Cardano’s Fading Momentum The early 2025 enthusiasm for Cardano (ADA) shows signs of fading away. The cryptocurrency maintains position near $0.80 while trading only produces around $640 million in deals. Network fee activity decreased by 52% leading to current fees now amounting to $8.1k. Our Relative Strength Index shows brief periods of overbought positions yet these rise and fall because of passing market enthusiasms instead of lasting market growth. The $10 goal established by Charles Hoskinson appears out of reach because the price of ADA seems probably limited to $1. Chainlink’s Steady Climb The LINK token maintains its position at $15.06 as the market shows a 0.68% increase through daily value appreciation. Technical analysis signals a potential downturn because the Relative Strength Index stands at 45.06 while bearish market sentiment prevails. LINK expects resistance at $15.22 as analysts predict it will reach only $19.63 by 2025. The integration capabilities of Chainlink stand strong yet its market expansion shows less potential than Mutuum Finance protocols (MUTM). Seizing Market Potential Cryptocurrency investors are quickly recognizing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as one of the leading crypto market players. Market investors demonstrate strong excitement through the fast-moving nature of its presale which is nearing the completion of phase 4. Its potential returns project to increase 140% while the speculative value is expected to reach $2.50 after launch day makes this opportunity very desirable. The MUTM platform differentiates itself from ADA and LINK by offering valuable operational capabilities along with strategic token distribution strategies. Investors keen on early opportunities should explore Mutuum Finance (MUTM) before phase 5’s price hike. Act swiftly to join the 9,500 holders capitalizing on this rising star.

Our Bonk price prediction for 2028 anticipates a price range of $0.00006884 to $0.00007868. In 2031, we expect Bonk price to record a maximum price of $0.000128 with an average price of $0.000123. Bonk (BONK) is a crypto token built on the Solana blockchain, much like DOGE, WIF, or SHIB. Bonk is a digital asset that can be traded on a number of online platforms, such as Binance, KuCoin, Kraken, MEXC, CoinEx, OKX, gate.io, and Bybit. Bonk has a maximum supply of 93 trillion. It is important to note that 76.92 trillion BONK are already in circulation. Interestingly, despite being a meme coin, Bonk’s supply is tied to its burning process to appreciate its value. The token became popular in 2022 after an airdrop to the Solana community. Despite its popularity and appeal, Bonk is highly volatile, and wild swings in its price action are routine. Along with being a meme coin, the Bonk ecosystem is far more diverse. Several projects built around Bonk also increase its utility prospects, which makes it a popular choice among traders and is also considered the primary trigger behind its 2024 bull run. Bonk Swap, Bonk Rewards, and Bonk BOT are the main features of the Bonk ecosystem. How will the utility of the Bonk ecosystem influence the value of the coin? Will BONK scale new heights? How high will BONK go in 2025? Let’s get into the BONK price prediction for 2025 and beyond.

Bonk price analysis gives out a bearish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. BONK/USD value has deteriorated to $0.00001666 over the past 24 hours. If we observe from an overall view, the currency has lost up to 2.05% of its worth. Technical indicators give out a relatively neutral verdict of the market scenario. If buyers hold the price above EMA trend lines, Bonk price might aim for a surge above the $0.0000177 level, where the BB’s upper limit resides. On the other hand, if Bonk drops below $0.000016, it could continue to consolidate within bearish zone around $0.000013. Is Bonk a good investment? After its launch in December 2022, Bonk quickly gained traction. Being on the Solana blockchain, it triggered a surge in SOL’s price due to Bonk’s unique distribution strategy. Bonk is a meme coin, but it has many side projects that contribute to its usability and make it more valuable than a mere dog meme coin. It is expected that by 2031, Bonk will reach $0.000128, which is approximately 684 times its current price, making it a good investment to consider. However, it is advised to do your own research and conduct expert opinion before investing in the highly volatile meme coin market. Why is Bonk down? Bonk lost a good portion of its value over the last 24 hours. In the last few hours, its value decreased to $0.000001666. Today’s decreasing buying demand pressure triggered a notable drop in the meme coin’s value. Will Bonk reach $0.000055? Bonk’s strongest current resistance level is $0.000022. Over the last few days, BONK saw intense selloff below this level. Bonk may not break above this level in the short term, but according to market speculation, it will reach $0.000055 by the end of 2027. Will Bonk reach $0.0000700? Bonk price prediction suggests that the coin can reach $0.0000700 and surpass it by 2028. When Bonk reaches this price level, its market capitalization will increase 4.5-fold. Will Bonk reach $1? According to the Bonk price prediction, Bonk may not achieve the $1 level in the foreseeable future. It will take considerable time and significant growth in the coin’s market cap to reach $1, which seems impossible as of now. Does Bonk have a good long-term Future? Bonk has garnered much attention from investors with its community-driven value. However, analysts do not share the same sentiment and are divided in their views on the crypto pair. This is true to an extent, as after its initial surge, sustaining the momentum has proved a challenge for Bonk. According to The Cryptopolitan’s review of the cryptocurrency, it is expected that Bonk will reach a maximum value of $0.000128 by the end of 2031, which is quite a bit above its current price. Recent news/opinion on Bonk Nearly one million unique addresses on the Solana blockchain now hold some amount of BONK tokens, according to a tweet by BONK INU’s official X handle. This milestone, as it happens, will be celebrated by burning one trillion BONK tokens, which will help reduce the supply as a community-driven initiative. $BONK is closing in on 1,000,000 Solana onchain holders❗❗❗ To celebrate, a burn of 1,000,000,000,000 $BONK tokens will take place when the milestone is achieved, as a part of the community driven Reduce Supply initiative. 🔥 To spread the word, use #LetsBONK in every post on… pic.twitter.com/gBqpjiDYr5 — BONK!!!

Bonk historic price sentiment Bonk price history In December 2022, Bonk was launched with a price of $0.0000001487 and made history by making a surge of more than 30% in SOL tokens. Bonk cryptocurrency quickly climbed into the top 100 by market cap, reaching $0.0000034 per coin on January 5, 2023, according to crypto market records. However, by March 2023, the price of the Bonk token had fallen from $0.0000004134, losing substantial value. In June 2023, Bonk’s price did not experience much action, and it gradually decreased to $0.0000001927 in September 2023. In October 2023, Bonk started to see bullish sentiment, with the price reaching $0.0000005518, which eventually reached $0.00002445 on December 15, 2023. Bonk closed 2023 with a price tag of $0.00001407, significantly higher than the price at the start of the year but almost 50% down from the highest price point of 2023. Bonk hit key highs in 2024, including $0.00003771 in March and an all-time high of $0.00004115 in May, before dipping to $0.0000223 in August. A late-year rally peaked at $0.00005825 in November, with the token closing 2024 at $0.00003043. At the start of January 2025, Bonk was trading at $0.00002976, and after further depreciation, it plunged to $0.000018 by February.

While macro uncertainty and volatility persist, XRP has remained resilient, holding firmly above key demand zones. The asset is now attempting to reclaim higher supply levels, with bulls pushing for a breakout that could define its next major move. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates As Accumulation Trend Develops – New Bullish Phase Ahead? Top analyst Ali Martinez recently shared a technical view showing that XRP is currently trading within a very tight range. This period of consolidation has compressed volatility, setting the stage for a potential explosive move. According to Martinez, a decisive daily close outside this range could determine the direction of the next major trend—either a breakout toward previous highs or a drop toward lower support levels. For now, XRP appears to be leaning bullish as it tracks the momentum seen across other major cryptocurrencies. Traders are watching closely to see if XRP can reclaim the $0.70–$0.75 range, which could open the door to a broader rally. Until then, the current structure suggests that XRP is coiling for a breakout, and the next few sessions could be decisive in confirming the trend ahead. XRP Trades Above $2 As Market Awaits Breakout Or Breakdown XRP is trading above the $2 mark, holding strong amid rising volatility and uncertainty across the crypto market. While bulls are showing signs of strength, they continue to struggle with the $2.35 resistance level—a barrier that has capped recent upward momentum. At the same time, bears have been unable to push the price below current support levels, keeping XRP locked in a tight consolidation range. The broader market is heating up, with Bitcoin testing key resistance near all-time highs, creating an environment where altcoins like XRP could soon follow with significant moves. Analysts are closely watching this setup, with many calling for a bullish expansion phase if XRP can break through overhead resistance and confirm strength. Martinez has identified two critical levels that will likely define XRP’s short-term trend: $2 and $2.26. According to Martinez, a decisive daily close outside this range could set the tone for the next major trend move—either a breakout toward new highs or a breakdown into deeper consolidation. However, market risks remain. Ongoing geopolitical tensions between the US and China continue to influence risk sentiment, and traders remain cautious as these macro factors develop. Still, XRP’s price structure shows strength, and if bulls can overcome $2.35, the asset could gain serious momentum. For now, all eyes are on XRP as it coils near key levels. The next few days will be crucial in determining whether this consolidation resolves to the upside or signals another round of range-bound price action. Either way, a major move appears to be on the horizon.

The 4-hour chart shows the price holding just above the 200-period simple moving average (SMA) at $2.11 and slightly below the 200-period exponential moving average (EMA) at $2.17. This positioning highlights a key zone of indecision, with bulls and bears locked in a tug-of-war around a major support and resistance confluence. The price structure remains neutral but constructive. After a failed attempt to push above the $2.30–$2.35 resistance range in late April, XRP has entered a phase of consolidation. Despite the pullback, bulls have defended the $2 psychological level multiple times, indicating strong demand in that area. Volume has remained steady, and XRP appears to be forming a higher low, which could serve as a launchpad for another attempt at the range highs. A breakout above the $2.26–$2.35 zone would likely confirm bullish continuation and open the path toward $2.50 and beyond.

33767162,[object Object],1746639029,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin Retailers Retreat? Small Wallet Addresses Decline Sharply As Market Turns Volatile,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-small-addresses-decline/,"The general crypto market has turned volatile, with Bitcoin, the largest digital asset, experiencing bearish movements as it falls below the key $95,000 price mark . Presently, BTC is gradually picking up steam, pushing prices close to $97,000. However, the recent waning price performance has hindered investors’ sentiment as a large portion of BTC small holders are exhibiting skepticism toward the asset by persistently offloading their coins. Small Bitcoin Wallet Addresses Vanish Rapidly With Bitcoin hovering near key support levels and showing early signs of renewed bearish pressure, it has triggered concerns about its short-term upside potential. During this waning period, Ali Martinez, an on-chain expert and trader, has outlined a negative behaviour among BTC small investors. This persistent negative sentiment is observed among small wallet addresses holding 1 BTC or more, often regarded as Shrimps holders. These wallet addresses, which are linked to newcomers and retail investors, seem to be leaving the market due to recent price fluctuations and uncertainty. Data shows that the number of these wallets with at least 1 BTC has significantly declined by over 3,400 over the past two weeks. The drop in these wallets suggests that small investors are losing confidence in BTC’s short-term prospects, even as larger holders consider expanding their holdings. Given the ongoing correction, this development marks a pivotal moment in BTC’s current cycle performance. Should this trend continue, it is likely to trigger short-term contractions in Bitcoin’s price , causing the flagship asset to revisit the next key support level at $92,000. Ali Martinez has also highlighted a similar waning sentiment among whale investors in the face of renewed market turbulence. On-chain data shows a notable selling pressure among these big investors as they offload a huge chunk of their holdings. Over the last ten days, whale wallets holding between 1,000 BTC and 10,000 BTC have sold off about 50,000 BTC . According to Martinez, this heightened selling pressure by whales is “a clear sign of profit-taking at current levels.” Specifically, it implies that high-net-worth investors are choosing to secure profits or hedge against potential continued price corrections. Such a huge selling pressure by whale holders reflects waning conviction about Bitcoin’s future as the flagship asset displays weakening momentum after a brief period of upward trend. Given that big investors are repositioning, speculations are whether the trend could lead to a robust shakeout for Bitcoin. Several Key BTC Metrics Are Dropping BTC’s waning performance has extended to several key metrics. FundingVest, an on-chain analyst and author, noted that Binance data indicate increasing short pressure while spot accumulation continues. Other metrics, like Open Interest (OI), have fallen by over 37%, funding rates have shifted toward negative territory , and the spot is rising higher than perpetual. These developments suggest that the market might be entering a reset mode or accumulation phase. However, the expert is confident that this can be a prelude to the next bullish trend for BTC.",Bitcoin News|Ali Martinez|binance|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Shrimps Holders|bitcoin whales|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|funding rates|FundingVest|OI|Opne Interest|Profit-taking,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-05-07 17:30:29

Bollinger Bands Hint at Imminent Breakout,https://cryptonews.com/news/is-pi-network-about-to-explode-bollinger-bands-hint-at-imminent-breakout/,"Pi (PI) has seen its price rise by 0.6% in the past 24 hours to sit at $0.5818 as the latest selling pressure cools down. Trading volumes have dropped significantly, now sitting at just $38.4 million – a stark contrast to the nearly $1.5 billion traded in a single day in early April. Lower volume typically suggests waning trader interest, and the price is now consolidating in a narrow range – a setup that often precedes a major breakout. With volatility likely to return, our full Pi Coin price prediction explores whether the next move will push PI toward a fresh high or deeper support. PI’s circulating supply has been expanding rapidly as more tokens are unlocked and more mainnet migrations are completed by PI token holders. This is a factor that favors a bearish Pi price prediction . The project’s monthly unlock schedule indicates that 223 million PI will be added to the circulating supply this month while nearly 455 million tokens will be added in May and June. This implies a 6.5% supply expansion in just two months. Meanwhile, the token’s prospects have also been affected by the reluctance of top exchanges like Coinbase and Binance to list PI as they refuse to go through the network’s complex Know Your Business (KYB) protocols. Pi Coin Price Prediction: Tight Consolidation Signals Explosive Breakout Ahead for PI A popular indicator known as the Bollinger Bands shows significant price compression as the upper and lower band of the indicator are the tightest they have ever been since the Pi Network public mainnet was launched. The price action appears to favor a bullish outcome thus far as the token has moved above the upper Bollinger with strong trading volumes. A break above the $0.6000 level would favor a bullish outlook for Pi while the key support to watch currently sits at $0.5700 – the token’s nearest lower low. Momentum indicators are favoring a bullish outcome as well in the hourly chart as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has been trending higher and currently stands above its 14-day simple moving average (SMA). Meanwhile, the MACD’s histogram is still in positive territory and has been trending higher lately as well. If PI breaks above its 200-hour EMA, this would confirm a strong bullish push that could propel the token to the $0.7000 area. For traders keeping an eye on early-stage opportunities, presales like BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) are also gaining attention, especially as market conditions hint at the start of a new bullish cycle. BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) Soars Past $5.4M as Investors Flock to This Bitcoin Passive Income Play Bitcoin (BTC) is once again approaching the $100,000 level and investors now have another way to profit as the top crypto rises to new heights. BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) is a meme coin with an attractive use case. It provides passive income to token holders as the price of Bitcoin rises. Starting at a baseline price of $100,000, BTCBULL holders are set to earn rewards every time Bitcoin gains another $25K. The first milestone is $125,000, where a portion of BTCBULL’s circulating supply will be burned – a move designed to increase scarcity and drive up the token’s value. At the $150,000 mark, holders will unlock even bigger benefits, including a direct Bitcoin airdrop – adding serious incentive as BTC pushes toward new highs. To buy $BTCBULL, simply head to the BTC Bull Token website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH or use a bank card to invest.

44287747,https://timestabloid.com/?p=66511,1746639293,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP Price Update: Analyst Highlights Key Levels to Watch,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-price-update-key-levels-to-watch/,"XRP has once again drawn the attention of crypto enthusiasts and analysts, as recent price movements indicate a critical point in its trajectory. Dom, a well-known crypto analyst, recently took to X to share insights on XRP’s price dynamics. According to Dom , XRP hit a significant apex yesterday, intersecting with the apex of the previous 100-day downtrend, the election Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP), and the monthly rolling VWAP. This crucial intersection has sparked debates on whether XRP will continue to defend this zone or fall to lower levels. $XRP update Earlier today price hit an apex of the previous 100 day downtrend, the election VWAP and the monthly rVWAP This is an area that we want to see continue to get defended as stated yesterday, equivalent to $BTC holding mid 93k If that fails, we look in the $1.90s To… https://t.co/qfUaEUxMNb pic.twitter.com/i7y5cYIcaL — Dom (@traderview2) May 6, 2025 Understanding the Apex: Why It Matters The term “apex” in technical analysis often represents a pivotal point where trend lines converge, potentially signaling a major price movement. In this context, XRP’s recent price action reached the apex of a prolonged 100-day downtrend, coinciding with two significant VWAP metrics. The election VWAP is an important tool used to gauge average trading volume over a specific period, while the monthly rVWAP provides a rolling average that adjusts to recent price changes. Dom emphasized that this area needs to be defended if XRP aims to maintain its upward momentum. Drawing a parallel to Bitcoin’s performance, Dom stated that holding this level is similar to Bitcoin maintaining a position at mid-$93,000. Such a comparison highlights the significance of this support zone, as losing it could trigger a downturn, pushing XRP’s price into the $1.90 range. Why VWAP Matters for XRP VWAP, or Volume Weighted Average Price, is a crucial indicator used by traders to determine the average price weighted by volume. It helps investors assess whether an asset is trading at a premium or discount relative to its average. In XRP’s case, the intersection of the election VWAP and the monthly rVWAP signals a point of strong market interest. Holding above these VWAP levels often indicates bullish sentiment, while dropping below could signal a potential sell-off. The convergence of these VWAP levels at the apex means that multiple trading metrics are aligning at the same price point, indicating heightened pressure for XRP to maintain this level. This technical setup suggests that if buyers fail to hold the line, it could pave the way for bearish momentum, pushing the price toward $1.90 or even lower. Price Targets and Key Resistance To achieve an immediate trend reversal, Dom suggests that XRP needs to reclaim the $2.12 level, where multiple VWAPs align. This zone acts as a psychological and technical resistance point, as breaking above it would signify renewed bullish momentum. Should XRP successfully breach this threshold, it could trigger a wave of buying pressure, pushing prices to new local highs. Several other analysts support this outlook. Crypto chartist EGRAG CRYPTO notes that the $2.12 mark aligns with critical moving averages that, if reclaimed, could act as a launchpad for a new rally. He points out that the last time XRP crossed a similar resistance line, it saw a surge of over 40% within a week. Hence, breaking $2.12 could significantly alter market sentiment and set the stage for further gains. Historical Context and Future Projections Historically, XRP has shown a pattern of sharp corrections followed by prolonged periods of consolidation. During the 2017 bull run , the asset experienced rapid surges after reclaiming major support zones, a trend that many analysts believe could repeat if the current apex holds. Dom’s analysis resonates with this perspective, indicating that breaking through $2.12 could catalyze a similar bullish breakout. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 From a broader perspective, market sentiment around XRP has been increasingly positive following recent legal victories and the launch of leveraged ETFs. The Tuttle Capital 2X Long XRP Daily Target ETF , expected to launch on May 7, 2025, has generated renewed interest in the asset, offering investors amplified exposure to XRP’s daily price movements. This ETF introduction could act as a catalyst, attracting both institutional and retail interest, particularly if XRP demonstrates strength at key technical levels. Market Sentiment and Potential Scenarios Despite the optimistic outlook, some analysts remain cautious, warning that the current setup could lead to a price drop if buyers fail to defend the apex. A fall below the $1.90 range would not only signal a bearish continuation but might also dampen investor enthusiasm that has been building since the ETF announcement. On the flip side, if XRP successfully reclaims the $2.12 level, it could signal that bulls are back in control, potentially pushing the price to test higher resistance at $2.30 and beyond. Dom’s projection aligns with this bullish scenario, suggesting that maintaining strength above $2.12 is key to avoiding a downward spiral. What Investors Should Watch Given the technical complexity of the current setup, investors are advised to keep an eye on the following: Key Support Levels: Monitoring the $1.90 range to see if the price tests and holds this critical area. VWAP Indicators: Keeping track of how the price interacts with the election VWAP and monthly rVWAP, as these will indicate whether bullish or bearish momentum is taking hold. Breakout Confirmation: Observing if XRP decisively breaks above $2.12, which would likely lead to a surge in trading volume and renewed market confidence. Dom’s insights underscore the critical nature of the current price intersection, as XRP navigates a challenging yet potentially rewarding technical landscape. As the crypto market continues to evolve, XRP’s performance around these key levels will provide crucial signals for both short-term traders and long-term investors. While caution is warranted, the possibility of a breakout remains, contingent on whether the asset can regain the $2.12 mark and maintain upward momentum. Investors should remain vigilant and adapt their strategies as the situation unfolds, as XRP’s next move could set the tone for the coming weeks. As always, balancing enthusiasm with realistic expectations will be key in navigating this pivotal moment. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

On May 2 alone, IBIT attracted $675 million, and over the week ending May 2, it bought $2.5 billion worth of Bitcoin. The inflow momentum extended into early May, with IBIT purchasing approximately 5,613 Bitcoin daily, including $531.2 million worth on May 5, bringing its total Bitcoin holdings to over 620,000 BTC valued at approximately $58.5 billion. This accumulation has positioned IBIT as the sixth-largest ETF by year-to-date inflows, surpassing the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD), which recorded $6.5 billion in inflows despite a 23% gain in gold prices compared to IBIT's 4% increase. Meanwhile, other Bitcoin ETFs such as those managed by Fidelity, Ark, Bitwise, and Grayscale experienced outflows or minimal inflows during this period. Ethereum ETFs showed negligible or negative net flows, with no notable inflows recorded. On May 6, Bitcoin ETFs overall saw an outflow of $85.7 million, and Ethereum ETFs had outflows of $17.9 million. The Federal Reserve has also been active in bond purchases, including a $20 billion buy of three-year bonds and a $42 billion purchase of 10-year bonds, which market observers suggest may provide liquidity supportive of asset markets including Bitcoin. BlackRock's continued accumulation amid these market dynamics underscores institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs despite broader market fluctuations.

Here’s What These Analysts Predict,https://cryptopotato.com/dogecoin-doge-ready-to-pop-heres-what-these-analysts-predict/,"TL;DR Dogecoin is showing bullish momentum, breaking past key support levels, with analysts eyeing short-term targets as high as $0.28. However, there are also some warning signs on the DOGE front, such as declining trading volumes and retail interest. Further Gains Ahead? The price of Dogecoin (DOGE) has pumped by almost 5% in the past 24 hours, currently trading at around $0.17 (per CoinGecko’s data). Some popular analysts believe there is much more room for growth based on the potential breakout of key levels. On May 6 , Ali Martinez – an X user who often explores the meme coin’s performance – claimed that DOGE “is testing key support” around $0.167. He thinks that holding this zone could spark a rebound toward $0.175 and even $0.183. Dogecoin did not struggle with that task , and as mentioned above, rallied beyond $0.17. For their part, Efloud described $0.169 as the low time frame (LTF) support level. “I don’t see a big problem if (the) price doesn’t lose this zone. This zone may work as (a) support area on pullbacks.” The X user also told their more than 170,000 followers that a further ascent would depend on the potential rise above $0.174. Trader Tardigrade assumed that DOGE’s chart has recently formed a so-called “Diamond Bottom” reversal pattern, suggesting a possible shift to an uptrend. The industry participant set a short-term target of around $0.28. Kamran Ashgar chipped in, too. They think DOGE “is waking up,” and when it does, it may fuel an overall revival of “the whole meme coin army.” What Are Indicators Suggesting? Contrary to the bullish predictions outlined by the analysts above, some metrics signal that the meme coin might suffer a setback soon. Data compiled by the blockchain analysis platform Arkham shows that DOGE exchange inflows have surpassed outflows in the past week. This hints at a shift from self-custody methods toward centralized platforms and could increase the immediate selling pressure. Additionally, DOGE’s trading volume has been on a significant decline in the past month, while the interest in it has faded lately. The Google searches involving the leading meme coin in the last weeks are far from the peaks observed in November last year and February 2025. Diminished interest in the asset may signal waning investor confidence, especially from retail. DOGE Google Searches, Source: Google Trends Finally, let’s observe DOGE’s Relative Strength Index (RSI), which measures the speed and magnitude of the latest price changes. The momentum oscillator varies from 0 to 100, and readings below 30 indicate the token could be overbought and headed for a rally. Conversely, anything above 70 is considered bearish territory. On May 6, the ratio dropped to 30, but it rose in the following hours. It is currently set at around 50, which is a neutral zone. The post Dogecoin (DOGE) Ready to Pop?

Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) rose to $0.00001270 on Wednesday, a few points above the year-to-date low of $0.00010. Third-party data shows that the total value locked in the Shibarium network has increased, crossing $3 million for the first time since March 29. This is a notable recovery from the year-to-date low of $1.8 million. The ongoing recovery has been driven by several dApps within the network. ShibaSwap’s assets climbed 32% in the last 30 days to $1.4 million, while WoofSwap’s assets have risen by 38% to $746,700. Other dApps, including K9 Financial DAO, ChewySwap, DogSwap, and PunkSwap, have also recorded gains of over 30%.

Despite this, the token remains above the ascending trendline that connects the lowest swing points since June 2023. Shiba Inu has also formed a harmonic XABCD pattern that began in March 2023, when it peaked at $0.000045. The AB leg occurred between August and November, while the BC leg formed between November and April. Therefore, the coin will likely jump to $0.000045, up by 265% from the current level.

Authored by Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan and Research Analyst Ayush Tripathi, the analysis offered a compelling counter-narrative to the often-simplistic view that XRP’s fate is tied solely to Ripple’s legal battles or corporate performance. “XRP is not equity in Ripple,” the report stated, addressing a long-standing misconception that has lingered in the crypto community. As per the authors, XRP should instead be viewed through a broader lens that considers utility, liquidity, and evolving regulatory clarity as its primary value drivers. According to the report, XRP’s principal strength lies in its design as a bridge currency for cross-border payments. The token was built to facilitate high-speed, low-cost international transfers, settling transactions in 3–5 seconds with minimal fees. This has made it a standout alternative to legacy systems like SWIFT, which are slower, costlier, and not operational around the clock. “XRP is one of the fastest, cheapest, and most scalable assets available today,” Bitwise emphasized. That said, Ripple’s legal saga with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has cast a shadow over XRP since 2020. However, the report argued that recent court developments may have worked in XRP’s favor. Notably, in July 2023, a U.S. District Court ruled that secondary market sales of XRP did not constitute securities offerings, providing long-awaited regulatory clarity. As per Bitwise, “ XRP is now one of only a few digital assets in the U.S. with regulatory clarity,” a distinction that could appeal to institutions seeking compliant crypto exposure. Moreover, despite regulatory uncertainty, XRP’s liquidity profile has remained robust. Bitwise pointed out that XRP is now the third most liquid crypto asset globally, trailing only Bitcoin and Ethereum. This depth of liquidity is significant for institutional players and use cases requiring high transaction throughput. “That means tighter spreads, lower costs, and more reliable execution,” the report noted. In addition to these structural advantages, Ripple has made strategic moves to strengthen XRP’s ecosystem. In May 2023, the company acquired Swiss custody firm Metaco for $250 million, signaling a push into institutional crypto infrastructure. While XRP holders do not benefit from Ripple’s equity or profits, such acquisitions build long-term trust and utility around the XRP ledger. “XRP sits at the intersection of utility, liquidity, and regulatory clarity.” Tripathi noted. According to him, these intersecting strengths, according to the report, may provide XRP with a unique edge in the next phase of crypto adoption as $10 XRP price gets envisioned. At press time, XRP was trading at $2.11, reflecting a 0.52% surge in the past 24 hours.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-07 17:45:33

Presidential candidate Hong Joon-pyo also vowed to deregulate the country’s crypto industry. South Korea’s top presidential candidate, Lee Jae-myung, said he would push to allow spot crypto ETFs currently outlawed in the country. The upcoming June 3 presidential election is shaping up to be a referendum on crypto policy, with leading candidates doubling down on promises to legalize crypto investment products, particularly Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs). South Korea ’s presidential candidate, Hong Joon-pyo, previously vowed to deregulate the country’s crypto industry. He also declared his intent to develop blockchain and virtual assets as a fully recognized industry, thus introducing the technology into public services. Lee pushes for the legalization of previously banned spot crypto ETFs If elected, South Korea’s leading presidential candidate, Lee, said he would introduce spot virtual asset ETFs and establish an integrated monitoring system to create a safe virtual asset investment environment. Calls for spot ETF approval have grown, especially after the U.S. approved Bitcoin spot ETFs, while South Korea’s regulator still classifies them as outside financial investment products. Lee also pledged to lower crypto trading fees and announced plans to create an integrated monitoring system to ensure a safer digital asset environment. The move aims to appeal to the 15.59 million crypto investors in South Korea, accounting for nearly 30% of the population, mostly youths. Current trading fees range from 0.05% to 0.2%, much higher than stock trading fees, averaging 0.015%. Along with the promise to approve crypto ETFs, Jae-Myung announced on May 6 that he would back other pro-crypto measures as part of a broader initiative to provide more investment opportunities for South Korea’s youth ahead of the June 3 election. “Youth struggles are not personal failings…They reflect structural issues caused by a lack of opportunity.” – Lee Jae-m yung , leader of the Democratic Party of Korea Lee, who is running for the left-wing Democratic Party of Korea, also promised to provide a new interest-bearing savings program and a financial planning program for younger South Koreans. DP’s Lee maintains wide lead in opinion polls According to a late April survey conducted by Realmeter, of 1,505 South Koreans aged over 18 years, Lee led the poll with 48.5%. Although Lee’s support dipped slightly, falling below the 50% mark due to uncertainty over the outcome of the election law violation case, he still remains the clear front-runner among all candidates, according to the pollster. Former Labor Minister Kim Moon-soo of the conservative People Power Party (PPP) came second with 13.4%, followed by former Daegu Mayor Hong Joon-pyo with 10.2%, while former PPP leader Han Dong-hoon garnered 9.7%. Trailing behind were Lee Jun-Seok, the minor New Reform Party’s candidate for the election, at 4.4%, and PPP Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo with 2.5%. The survey, which had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points and a confidence rate of 95%, also showed that by party, the DP received 46.8% support while the PPP garnered 34.6%. A Gallup Korea poll released on April 25 showed Lee with 38% support among voters compared with just 6% for Han. Additionally, a joint survey by four pollsters released on May 1 showed Lee in the lead with 42%, Han Duck-soo with 13%, Han Dong-hoon with 9%, and Kim with 6%. A showdown scenario between Han and Lee showed that Lee would still emerge on top with 46% against Han’s 31%. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Colb Asset SA, a leading Swiss innovator in real-world asset tokenization , has successfully closed an oversubscribed CHF 6 million (~$7.3 million) seed extension round. The capital came from a private investor managing a portfolio of over $20 billion in assets, reinforcing institutional confidence in Colb’s mission. The funding will accelerate Colb’s efforts to enable blockchain-based tokenization of high-demand pre-IPO equity , including high-demand pre-IPO equity opportunities. The firm also aims to tokenize institutional-grade Swiss wealth strategies and select investment funds, targeting fast-growing markets and on-chain treasury managers seeking access to premium assets traditionally reserved for private or institutional investors. Redefining ‘what’s possible in capital formation’ The investment will also support Colb’s strategic expansion into emerging markets, where the firm plans to bring geo-economically strategic sectors, such as energy, infrastructure, utilities, and agribusiness — on-chain. These industries, vital to global development and resilience, offer strong growth potential and align with Colb’s mission to democratize access to historically exclusive assets. “Our ecosystem redefines what’s possible in capital formation. We’re blending the prestige and rigor of traditional finance with the openness and velocity of blockchain to unlock institutional-quality investments for a global, decentralized audience,” said Yulgan Lira, CEO of Colb Asset SA. Beyond asset tokenization, the funds will also support the growth of Colb’s fintech infrastructure.

Positive sentiment prevailed in the broader markets, though the tech sector saw some turbulence. On Wednesday, May 7, the Dow Jones rose 377 points, or 0.92%, while the S&P 500 gained 0.42%. The Nasdaq, however, hovered just above the opening level, up 0.07%, after briefly diving 200 points earlier in the day. The tech-heavy index fell sharply from a high of 17,793 to a low of 17,600 in under an hour, largely due to pressure on major tech stocks.

The next moves could determine their short-term future. Will these digital assets maintain their ground and surge, or are they on the verge of a decline? Discover insights and potential outcomes in this unfolding scenario. Avalanche Trading Overview and Key Levels AVAX 's significant movement is evident over the last month with a notable gain of 24.71%, while the past six months show a decline of 27.25%. Price action has been volatile, reflecting strong short-term rallies countered by a bearish long-term trend. The fluctuation suggests that recent bullish sentiment may be outweighed by broader downward pressure, emphasizing the coin's mixed historical performance. Current trading ranges from $16.03 to $24.43 with clear boundaries given by a support at $11.14 and resistance at $27.94. A modest resistance point exists at $36.34 and a second support at $2.73. Bears appear to have an edge with a negative momentum indicator, though the market is in a consolidation phase. Consider trading within these levels by watching for decisive moves around key price barriers. Polkadot Market Snapshot: Past Momentum and Current Price Zones Polkadot gained 8.17% over the past month while experiencing a 4.80% drop in the last six months. A 4.34% decline during the past week highlights the mixed performance. Price activity shows intermittent rallies within an overall downbeat half-year trend. The coin has displayed fluctuations that kept traders alert to market sentiment, reflecting both upward surges and pullbacks. Polkadot now trades between $3.41 and $4.54, with a nearby resistance level around $5.03 and support near $2.76. Secondary levels of resistance and support at $6.16 and $1.64 help outline potential trading ranges. Momentum and moving averages lean slightly bearish, suggesting that short-term trades might focus on buying near support with profit targets near the $5.03 resistance level. Conclusion The current state of AVAX and DOT remains uncertain as they test critical support levels. Strong buying interest is crucial to prevent a breakdown. If the support holds, it can signal buyer confidence. Failure to hold could lead to further declines, prompting caution among traders. The outcome will likely shape their short-term performance.

To put this into perspective, Coinranking shows there are currently 171 Layer-1 (L1) coins. Even so, L1 and Layer-2 (L2) networks often struggle with on-chain user engagement. Although Ethereum is known for driving a large majority of users , newer networks, particularly, find it challenging to maintain growth and continual adoption. Hot take but there’s way to many L1s This is good because it creates competition but it’s gotten so bad the markets are starting to be diluted Especially when you consider they could’ve been L2’s from the start I believe as the technology evolves we’ll slowly centralize… pic.twitter.com/MwKQU6F8Py — Alduin (@RealAlduin) May 4, 2025 Gamification Drives Engagement A number of blockchain networks are therefore turning to gamification to stand out in a sea of ever-evolving chains. Gamification leverages task-based challenges , point systems, and rewards to activate and grow online communities. A Coinbase spokesperson told Cryptonews that gamification can indeed help drive on-chain engagement. He explained that this was proven last year when Coinbase hosted its annual event, “Onchain Summer .” “Our team built a ‘Summer Pass’ game experience that allowed users to earn points as they participated and transacted on-chain. As users earned points, they were able to unlock different levels, while receiving various non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and prizes. Users could then share their summer pass progress on social networks with a personal referral link to earn extra points,” the spokesperson explained. In addition, Coinbase users who participated in Onchain Summer could spin a wheel daily to earn extra points, which further drove engagement and retention. “We saw that 83% of people who spun the wheel once returned to spin again,” the spokesperson added. quick walkthrough of onchain summer on @coinbase only going to get better and bigger from here pic.twitter.com/leXl5LSoze — jesse.base.eth (@jessepollak) July 13, 2024 Crypto Tipping Platform on X Drives Engagement Alan Orwick, CEO of L1 Quai Network, told Cryptonews that he further believes gamification is key for ensuring the growth of a blockchain network. Orwick recently helped Quai Network launch a crypto tipping platform that can be used on the social media network X. Known as “Kipper,” Orwick shared that its goal is to empower creators and fans with peer-to-peer transfers, allowing monetization across social platforms. While some content creators and influencers can monetize using traditional fiat methods on X, Kipper allows users to send anyone tips in $QUAI. “Kipper drives on-chain engagement by using Quai’s native token—$QUAI—for tips,” Orwick said. “This gives users financial sovereignty and access across Web2 social networks.” Progress: ███░░░░░░░░ (7.5%) Over 100 users have claimed almost 4,000 $QUAI in rewards by participating in Kipper challenges over the last week. ⁰⁰ Congratulations to everyone, but the bigger pots still remain to be claimed.⁰⁰ Are you up to the challenge?… pic.twitter.com/AUhSIPjOOw — Kipper (@kippermoney) May 5, 2025 Although Kipper was launched on April 28, Orwick pointed out that desired results are already being achieved. These results are encouraging, as Orwick stated that it has been challenging to demonstrate the benefits associated with Quai Network since the launch of its mainnet in February this year. The L1 blockchain utilizes a decentralized energy dollar, or stablecoin, called $Q1. This is designed to provide predictable value tied directly to energy while allowing transactions across a Proof-of-Work blockchain. Although the use case is interesting, some users remain unaware of the network’s utility. “Private $Q1 tips are tied to energy, yet this needs clearer education. I’m hoping that Kipper will help drive engagement, while letting users understand the benefits behind Quai Network,” Orwick said. Gamified Quests For DePIN Adoption L1 peaq also uses gamification to drive adoption, but for decentralized physical infrastructure networks, or DePINs . According to Coingecko, the DePIN market cap is worth around $18.9 billion. Several blockchain networks are competing to drive market share in the DePIN sector, which is why on-chain engagement is essential. Max Thake, co-founder of peaq, told Cryptonews that he believes gamification is massively important when it comes to an L1 network that was built for a specific use case. “Peaq’s mission is to power the machine economy, and DePINs are a huge part of this,” Thake said. “But the DePIN space is still quite new, and remains an unknown for Web2 folks and somewhat obscure even for a Web3 audience.” Thake therefore believes that gamification is necessary. He shared that peaq recently launched its gamified “Get Real” campaign to spark DePIN engagement. “When joining the Get Real campaign, users can mint customizable NFTs and complete quests,” Thake said. “Points are then earned, which count toward end-of-season rewards.” Thake elaborated that user quests involve activities such as measuring sound pollution with a smartphone or driving with a Web3 navigator to collect data. → create a Farmsent account → get on the whitelist to run an agronode → get rewarded @Farmsent_io ’s first onchain quests are now live on Get Real https://t.co/3g9ohJieUU pic.twitter.com/OHY2qp7tUz — peaq (@peaq) February 9, 2025 The Get Real campaign underwent its beta season in February this year, but Thake shared that the campaign is slated for a full launch this quarter due to impressive results. “We were battle-testing the core mechanics behind the campaign, but we still saw an uptick in new devices being onboarded, and the participating DePINs told us they had more people joining in,” he said. “That was exactly our goal—we weren’t aiming to create meaningless activity, but rather to introduce more people to DePINs to accelerate adoption.” Gamification To Solve The L2 Discoverability Challenge While gamification is proving to drive on-chain engagement for L1s, this model can also help L2s get discovered. For example, Ren Yu Kong, ecosystem lead at Eclipse—a Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) built on Ethereum that launched in March 2024—told Cryptonews that L2 networks have historically had a discovery problem, often relying on a limited social layer for app discovery. He added that the experience of interacting with the chain itself and trying new apps hasn’t always been engaging for users. “If you look at the general trend of consumer apps, gamification is increasingly becoming essential to drive retention and user behavior,” Yu Kong said. “We further believe that gamification should first and foremost come at a chain level to help applications get distribution and net new users.” To ensure this, Yu Kong explained that Eclipse launched “Turbo Tap,” which is a gamified experience meant to drive engagement on Eclipse. Users can earn points by accumulating “grass” through interactive games. “At its core, Turbo Tap allows users to interact with Turbo, which is a highland cow. The goal for users is to accumulate as much grass as possible by tapping the cow, bridging over assets, using various applications, and collecting in-game power-ups such as Milk,” Yu Kong said. Turbo Tap launched in February this year and has already driven over 230,000 new users to the Eclipse network. Yu Kong added that over 15 billion interactions with the chain have since been documented. Challenges To Consider Although gamification can help drive on-chain engagement, a number of challenges remain. For instance, Yu Kong mentioned that the biggest challenge associated with launching an experience like Turbo Tap is maintaining a high bar for the user experience. “Building a gamified experience often involves many moving parts, including off-chain components, on-chain contracts, indexing data, connecting socials, various infrastructure needs, and more,” he said. According to Yu Kong, ensuring that all of these elements work in unison without bugs is a non-trivial effort for any engineering team. “This is especially true if many users start interacting. The simplest way to combat this is to do extensive internal testing while developing the product,” he added. Orwick also commented that while launching Kipper wasn’t challenging, building the right chain architecture for it was time-consuming. “Kipper will need continued focus on user feedback and experience to get the loop right,” Orwick noted.

On Tuesday, he testified before the House Appropriations subcommittee, where he broke down the Trump administration’s cost-cutting campaign and warned lawmakers about the pressure building under the debt ceiling. He said the Treasury Department had already cut $2 billion from the IRS information technology budget without disrupting any services. The goal now is to cut even more by moving the IRS off paper and into automation. “Last year, the IRS spent approximately $450 million on paper processing with nearly 6,500 full-time staff dedicated to the task,” Scott said. “Through policy changes and automation, Treasury aims to reduce this expense to under $20 million by the end of President Trump’s second term.” That’s not all. Scott told lawmakers that more savings are coming from canceling old contracts, dumping unused software subscriptions, and cleaning up bloated tech spending. He defended the administration’s plan to cut nearly $2.5 billion more from the IRS in the proposed fiscal 2026 budget. That same budget also slashes $163 billion from education, housing, and medical research. He pinned the waste on spending that ballooned under Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, which pushed $80 billion into the IRS. Since then, Republican budget bills have chopped that funding nearly in half. “I am confident that we will make substantial progress in the IT and right-size the payments system, the collection system,” he said. “As I’ve repeatedly said, my priorities are collections, privacy and customer service.” When asked whether these cuts could hurt enforcement and collections, Scott pushed back. He said it takes years to train new agents and claimed the real gains would come from smarter systems and artificial intelligence. “So I believe, through smarter IT, through this AI boom, that we can use that to enhance collections,” said Scott. “And I would expect that collections would continue to be very robust, as they were this year.” Scott Bessent demands leadership on crypto as lawmakers fight over Trump’s involvement On Wednesday, Scott also testified before the House Financial Services Committee, where crypto regulation dominated the conversation. He was asked directly why the US should lead on crypto policy. His answer was: “We believe that the United States should be the premier destination for digital assets. And as members of this committee and the Senate are attempting to do — create good market structure around that — so that US best practices are used around the world.” Scott was appointed by President Donald Trump in January and confirmed by the Senate. He’s also a member of the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, established under Trump’s January 23 executive order. He’s been consistent on crypto, saying the industry is “here to stay.” But Congress can’t seem to agree on what to do next. On Monday, House Republicans introduced a discussion draft proposing a new setup for the CFTC and SEC, with rules around disclosures and oversight. But many Democrats walked out of the hearing. They held a separate roundtable on Tuesday to air their concerns over Trump’s direct involvement in the crypto space. Trump recently launched his own memecoin and backed a stablecoin through World Liberty Financial , raising questions about conflicts of interest. Rep. Angie Craig, one of the few Democrats who stayed for the hearing, said both parties have to figure this out together. Over in the Senate, another bill focused on stablecoin regulation is scheduled for a vote on Thursday. That plan has also stalled. On Saturday, Democratic Senators Ruben Gallego, Mark Warner, Raphael Warnock, and Lisa Blunt Rochester said the bill is full of unresolved issues and warned against rushing it.

According to a May 7 announcement, Strive is going public through a reverse merger and plans to use the combined company’s stock to accumulate Bitcoin ( BTC ). The deal will see Strive merging with Asset Entities — a social media marketing company listed on the Nasdaq. The combined entity will operate under the Strive brand and use its access to the public equity markets to finance Bitcoin purchases, the company said. Once the deal closes, Strive plans to issue approximately $1 billion in equity and debt and use the proceeds to accumulate BTC. The asset manager “intends to use all available mechanisms to build a Bitcoin war chest and build a long-term investment approach designed to outperform Bitcoin,” it said. Strive plans to allow “Bitcoin holders to contribute Bitcoin in exchange for public stock through a structure that is intended to be tax-free,” it said. As of May 7, the company manages approximately $2 billion in net assets across a variety of funds. In December, Strive filed to list an exchange-traded fund (ETF) investing in convertible bonds issued by MicroStrategy and other corporate Bitcoin buyers.

Companies pioneering the Bitcoin buyer approach, such as Strategy have seen their share prices surge by 350% in 2024. Analysts say adding Bitcoin to corporate treasuries can “potentially be a valuable hedge against growing fiscal deficits, currency debasement, and geopolitical risks,” asset manager Fidelity Digital Assets said in a 2024 report. Corporate Bitcoin treasuries collectively hold roughly $74 billion worth of BTC as of May 7, according to Bitcointreasuries.net. Ramaswamy founded Strive in 2022.

Now, multiple Democratic candidates are openly supporting digital assets. They say crypto is the future and want New Jersey to be ready. At least three of the six Democrats vying for the nomination in the June 10 primary — U.S. Representatives Mikie Sherrill, Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, and Josh Gottheimer — have incorporated crypto support into their platforms. Sherrill, who currently leads some primary polls, said embracing the industry is a pragmatic move for modern policymakers. Sherrill said that crypto was one of the planks in her platform, adding that it is part of the economy and that there is a need to dive into understanding the space and how to move forward, as it is not going away. Steve Fulop is also hopping on the crypto bandwagon. Since 2018, he has invested in digital assets personally through Bitcoin and Ether. Fulop says that, if elected, he would invest some of the state’s pension fund in crypto-backed exchange-traded funds, as Jersey City did under him. Another Democratic hopeful with an eye on crypto is the U.S. Rep. Josh Gottheimer. He says digital assets can create jobs and support the state’s economy. Gottheimer said that New Jersey has a massive ability to set the tone for many other states regarding crypto. He also backed several crypto-friendly bills, including proposals to regulate stablecoins and make the U.S. more competitive worldwide. Crypto advocacy groups turn to politics Crypto is now officially not a fringe issue in American politics. Big money and big advocacy groups are now fighting for pro-crypto policies — and New Jersey is the latest stage. Stand With Crypto , an industry advocacy group backed by Coinbase, is underwriting the Democratic and Republican primary debates this May in New Jersey. It’s also the only sponsor of the livestreams of the events. The organization aims to expand its grassroots network, which comprises over 62,000 members in New Jersey. Internal polling shows that 63% of those individuals are more willing to back candidates who favor digital assets. Fairshake, one of the largest crypto political action committees (PACs), invested over $194 million in the 2024 election cycle. Its goal? Vote for people who support crypto innovation. FairShake has, so far, donated to no New Jersey gubernatorial campaigns — but several would-be candidates, like Gottheimer, have received the group’s backing during their past congressional contests. Gottheimer said that stablecoins are an important part of the growing digital asset ecosystem and emphasized the need for common-sense rules to safeguard Jersey families as they invest in digital assets rather than driving these opportunities overseas. Candidates use crypto to stand out in a crowded primary field Only two gubernatorial races are taking place in the U.S. this year — one in New Jersey and the other in Virginia. In New Jersey, 11 candidates are vying to replace Democratic Governor Phil Murphy, who is term-limited. Though crypto isn’t a priority issue, it is increasingly a mechanism for candidates to distinguish themselves in a crowded field. Voters care about mass transit, housing, and the impact of President Donald Trump, who made crypto a centerpiece of his 2024 campaign. The race remains wide open. An April poll by Rutgers-Eagleton found that about one-third of voters are still undecided. Republican frontrunner Jack Ciattarelli has yet to take a public stance on digital assets. Meanwhile, Mario Kranjac, a former mayor of Englewood Cliffs and a Trump-aligned Republican, said he’s a fan of digital currencies, but they won’t be the focus of his campaign. He said that, as far as crypto being a mainstream fiat currency was concerned, the industry was not there yet, but it was something they were looking at very strongly. On the Democratic side, frontrunner Mikie Sherrill has offered a more cautious endorsement, saying Democrats shouldn’t reject crypto just because Republicans support it.

After years driven by meme coins, hyped Layer 1s, and speculative NFTs, 2025 is becoming the year of utility tokens. These tokens are built to serve actual purposes within their networks. As the space moves toward real use and broader adoption, assets that power services, infrastructure, or automation are starting to stand out. Chainlink (LINK), Ripple (XRP), and Unstaked (UNSD) are three examples showing how utility is becoming a key theme. Each addresses real needs with working models and active platforms. But the differences in how they serve users and move forward are clear. Ripple (XRP): Built for Global Payment Use Ripple is often considered one of the most real-world-focused utility projects in crypto. XRP is used to enable fast, low-cost cross-border payments, mainly for banks and fintech firms. This function addresses a major need, and RippleNet is growing its network in areas like Latin America, Asia, and the Middle East. In 2025, Ripple is gaining ground again thanks to improved regulation in the U.S. and licensing in new regions. Activity on the network is rising, and XRP recently moved above $2.30. Some analysts believe it could reach $5.00 if institutions keep showing interest. Still, Ripple faces limits. Its adoption relies on bank partnerships and legal clarity. Most of its utility is focused on businesses, which means its impact is not as visible to regular users. It continues to be a utility token, but one shaped mostly by corporate use. Chainlink (LINK): Supplying Data to DeFi Systems Chainlink serves as a core part of DeFi. It brings outside data into smart contracts, such as prices or weather stats, which supports everything from trading platforms to insurance tools. LINK is the token that rewards data providers and helps keep the system reliabl In 2025, Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) is gaining use on several top blockchains. Projects like Aave and Synthetix continue to rely on Chainlink, showing its key role in connecting data to DeFi apps. Unlike Ripple, Chainlink is built more for developers. Its value comes from being tied directly into smart contract systems. As DeFi grows, so does LINK’s role. It has become an important part of the crypto stack, even if it operates behind the scenes. Unstaked (UNSD): AI Agents Designed for Web3 Community Tools Unstaked brings a new kind of utility to crypto through real-time AI automation built for decentralized platforms. It allows users to set up AI agents that post content, manage chats, and help grow online communities on Telegram and X. These agents are designed to work on their own and only earn UNSD tokens if they show useful results. The reward system is based on an on-chain process called Proof of Intelligence (PoI), which records every action completed by an agent. Rewards are given according to transparent results. For DAOs, NFT groups, and Web3 networks, Unstaked introduces a way to scale AI-driven engagement without using any central service. Unstaked is now in Stage 3 of its public crypto presale . Tokens are priced at $ $0.00689, and the project has already raised over $1 million in few weeks. A $20 million liquidity pool is locked in for the launch, and no private or VC allocations are involved. Unstaked stands out by offering real tools before the token is even listed. Unlike Ripple and Chainlink, Unstaked is led by its user base. It supports creators, marketers, and builders who want AI features without depending on a closed platform. Key Insight: Utility Tokens That Let Users Lead May Shape What Comes Next Ripple helped show how crypto can be used in global finance. Chainlink showed that the systems running in the background are just as important. Now, Unstaked is showing how utility can reach the social level of Web3, where AI tools work directly with users instead of just systems or institutions. This points to a larger shift. The next wave of growth in crypto likely depends on real use, not just big ideas. Tokens that offer working features, whether in finance, data, or AI, are set to gain more attention. In that future, utility tokens like XRP, LINK, and UNSD each show what working use looks like, and each fills a different but valuable role. As more users join Web3, the tokens that provide useful tools, not just promises, will likely last.

The FED has continued to keep policy interest rates unchanged since December 2024. The decision is driven by factors such as global uncertainty, slowing economic growth, and volatile inflation trends. The Fed has warned of risks of higher unemployment and inflation, citing growing uncertainty about the economic outlook. FED Chairman Jerome Powell will hold a press conference today at 21:30 Turkish time following the two-day monetary policy meeting. At the March 2025 meeting, the Fed had kept the policy rate steady at 4.25% – 4.50% and announced that it foresaw two quarter-point rate cuts by the end of the year. Powell said at that meeting that they did not intend to make a hasty rate cut despite geopolitical risks. The FOMC statement said, “If risks emerge that could prevent the achievement of targets, the stance of monetary policy will be adjusted as necessary.” However, President Donald Trump has repeatedly called on Powell to cut interest rates in order to prevent a slowdown in the economy. Indeed, in the first quarter of 2025, the US economy contracted by 0.3 percent on an annual basis due to the effects of trade wars. In contrast, April employment data is positive: 177,000 new jobs were added in the US. In March, core PCE inflation data remained unchanged; in February, this rate increased by 0.4 percent. Related News: Last Minutes Remaining - FED to Announce Interest Rate Decision, Here Are Expert Expectations and Predicted Date for First Rate Cut There is still uncertainty about how many interest rate cuts will be made throughout the year. According to Kalshi data, investors now expect three interest rate cuts in 2025, compared to the previous estimate of four. Wall Street expectations are as follows: Goldman Sachs: 3 cuts (July, September, November) Morgan Stanley: 0 discount Bank of America: 4 discounts Citigroup: 5 off JPMorgan & Barclays: 2 discounts Fed median forecast: 2 cuts *This is not investment advice.

In an appearance before a Congressional House Committee Tuesday morning focused on the international financial system, Bessent says the US should take a global leadership role on digital assets. “We believe that the United States should be the premier destination for digital assets, and, as members of this committee and the Senate are attempting to do, create good market structure around that so that US best practices are used around the world.” He also says that the crypto market may give US Treasuries a massive demand boost. “Digital assets are an important source of innovation that can drive usage of the US dollar around the world, as with stablecoin legislation. There is speculation that there may be up to $2 trillion of demand over the next few years for US government securities from digital assets.” Last month, veteran macro investor Luke Gromen explained that Bitcoin ( BTC ) can influence demand for US Treasuries. According to Gromen, a Bitcoin bull market typically increases demand for dollar-pegged crypto assets known as stablecoins. Stablecoin issuers such as Tether and Circle predominantly rely on Treasury bills to back their coins on a 1:1 basis. As of December 2024, Tether has invested over $94.47 billion in T-bills to back USDT . Circle owns $22.047 billion worth of T-bills as of February of this year to back its stablecoin, USDC . Meanwhile, two stablecoin bills making their way through Congress, the STABLE Act of 2025 and the GENIUS Act of 2025, require issuers to invest in T-bills and other real-world assets to back their coins.

Large Bitcoin holders with over 1,000 BTC have accumulated significantly since March 2025, reflecting the Q1 2024 trend. Bitcoin (BTC) price saw a short-squeeze above $97,000 on May 6, shortly after US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that trade talks would commence with China on May 10. At the same time, BTC’s realized capitalization, a metric adding the dollar value of all coins at their last moved price, soared to a new all-time high of $890 billion on May 7, 2025. The surge also marks the metric’s third consecutive week of record-breaking growth. Bitcoin realized cap. Source: CryptoQuant The realized cap’s rise highlights the total investment held by Bitcoin owners, with long-term holders (LTHs) and short-term holders (STHs) increasing their positions. It reflects investors’ conviction, signaling a potential anticipation for a price breakout. Recent market trends have supported this optimism. Cointelegraph reported that large Bitcoin holders have been actively accumulating Bitcoin since late March 2025. Data indicates that wallets between 10 and 10,000 BTC added 81,338 BTC over six weeks. This accumulation signals confidence in the current price uptrend and the possibility of BTC returning to $100,000. Glassnode data revealed a notable rise in Bitcoin whale addresses holding over 1,000 BTC, climbing from 1,945 on March 1 to 2,006 on May 7. This marks the most significant 30-day increase for this cohort in 2025 and the highest surge since Q1 2024, when a similar accumulation trend preceded Bitcoin's all-time high in March 2024.

Bitcoin’s support zone between $93,000 and $95,000 showed resilience on May 6, with BTC bulls holding the level, supported by activity in long perpetual positions. There is downside liquidity between $91,600 and $89,000, which Bitcoin could retest if bearish momentum persists after this week’s FOMC minutes and Federal Reserve presser. However, if BTC breaks above the resistance zone of $97,000 to $99,000, the higher time frame (HTF) outlook could tilt toward bulls. Bitcoin 1-day chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView This resistance area carries weight due to a price cluster formed in Q1, which previously led to a downward move. If BTC price clears $99,000, it might shift market dynamics, potentially pressuring short positions and adding to bullish liquidity. The $100,000 level appears to be more of a psychological marker than a significant resistance level. If BTC surpasses the $97,000-$99,000 resistance and establishes it as support, it could pave the way for a move toward $110,000, although this would depend on market conditions and momentum. Michael van de Poppe, founder of MN Capital, suggested that the dip below $94,000 and subsequent recovery may indicate a market bottom. He expressed optimism about a potential Bitcoin breakout to $100,000 within the next two weeks. On the other hand, crypto trader Honey expected a steady rise for BTC, predicting a new all-time high of $111,111 by the end of Q2.

The decision came as the Committee said the US economy is still expanding at a “solid pace,” despite trade-related disruptions. Inflation is still running hot, and labor conditions are holding strong, but the Fed admitted it’s more worried than before. The Committee said the unemployment rate has stayed low in recent months and described the labor market as stable. But it also warned that the overall economic picture is becoming harder to predict. “Uncertainty about the economic outlook has increased further,” the Committee said. It noted that the risks of both higher unemployment and rising inflation have gone up since the last meeting. Fed keeps tightening policy, but holds off on rate hike The Fed said it’s still focused on its long-term goals: keeping inflation near 2% and supporting maximum employment. But with both inflation and labor showing signs of imbalance, the Committee chose not to increase rates yet. Instead, it said future hikes will depend entirely on the next batch of data. “The Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks,” the statement said. They also confirmed they’ll continue pulling money out of the financial system by reducing their holdings of Treasury securities, agency debt, and mortgage-backed securities. That strategy is staying in place even as interest rates hold. The Committee made it clear they’re not backing off their tightening path entirely — just pausing for now. The Fed said it’s ready to respond fast if anything shifts. If the data turns sour, they’ll tweak policy again. “The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge,” they wrote. That includes signs of worsening inflation, unemployment, or other unexpected hits to the economy. The Fed said it will base all future decisions on a wide range of information: job numbers, price levels, expectations, financial conditions, and what’s happening internationally.

Table of Contents Crypto mirrors the tension but charts its own path Global trade system under pressure ETF flows mask deeper trends No past model fits this cycle Market awaits a catalyst Crypto mirrors the tension but charts its own path The mood across global financial markets has turned visibly tense. What began as a focused concern around central bank decisions has morphed into a broader wave of uncertainty, shaped by conflicting macro indicators, uneven growth data, and investor hesitation. The reintroduction of U.S. tariffs under President Donald Trump’s administration has added another layer of friction. A particularly bold move, such as the 100% tariff on foreign films, has not only reignited trade war concerns but also signaled a shift back to protectionist rhetoric. For investors who had grown accustomed to relative trade stability, this has raised new questions about supply chains, international cooperation, and the policy outlook heading into the second half of the year. Markets have already reacted. The S&P 500, which had gained steadily over the past few days, broke its streak as investors pulled back amid deteriorating macro signals. In contrast, traditional safe-haven assets have seen rising inflows. Gold prices have edged upward, and Treasuries have gained traction again, a move often associated with risk aversion during economic softness. Notably, the most recent GDP print disappointed expectations, while inflation has remained sticky around 3%, leaving the Federal Reserve in a difficult spot. Rate cuts appear unlikely during Fed’s May 7 meeting, yet the tightening already in place may not be enough to shield against stagnation. Fed will announce its interest rate decision today. Markets pricing in a 95% probability that rates will be held steady pic.twitter.com/M0ZVOfQTZz — LANGERIUS (@langeriuseth) May 7, 2025 Jobless claims have begun ticking upward, and April’s CPI figures reflected consumer pressure that’s still far from easing. The Treasury market’s absorption of a $42 billion 10-year bond sale is a notable development. It suggests institutional investors are repositioning for longer-term safety, likely preparing for potential policy missteps or a downturn that could surface without much warning. Amid all this, the crypto market has found itself responding with its own brand of volatility. Bitcoin ( BTC ) reached an all-time high of nearly $109,000 in January, driven by ETF optimism, institutional inflows, and the broader narrative of crypto as a macro hedge. But it wasn’t built on solid ground. Over the months that followed, BTC lost nearly 30% of its value before clawing back to around $97,000 as of this writing on May 7. BTC price chart | Source: crypto.news BTC still remains a strong asset in terms of performance year-to-date, but the erratic price swings have forced both retail and institutional players to reassess their strategies. Let’s explore how current macroeconomic pressures, including recession risks, trade tensions, and monetary ambiguity are shaping investor behavior and what the coming months may hold for the crypto market. Global trade system under pressure A growing sense of macroeconomic fragility is beginning to shape investor expectations across asset classes. J.P. Morgan has placed the probability of a U.S. recession in 2025 at 60%, reflecting heightened concern over the systemic strain within the financial ecosystem. Treasury markets continue to flash warning signs. The inversion of the 10-year and 3-month yield curve remains persistent, a traditional signal of recession risk. Compounding the situation is the approaching maturity of over $6.5 trillion in the U.S. Treasury debt, a volume that could pressure liquidity and challenge the government’s refinancing capabilities in an already uncertain interest rate environment. Charlie Hu, co-founder of Bitlayer, views this convergence of rising debt obligations and monetary policy uncertainty as a pivotal fault line in global capital markets. “There are approximately $6.5 trillion USD worth of Treasury bonds approaching maturity in the coming months. The economic slowdown is putting pressure on the Fed’s interest rate and monetary policy decisions.” He adds that a prolonged period of elevated rates, coupled with the urgency to refinance, could rattle investor confidence. “If the market continues to experience high interest rates alongside a large volume of maturing debt that needs refinancing, the U.S. government will be forced to address the situation carefully — striking a balance between managing high inflation and high debt levels, the two biggest metrics influencing capital flow and investor behavior in global markets.” This mounting pressure extends beyond the U.S. economy. The International Monetary Fund has issued repeated warnings about trade protectionism and retaliatory tariffs, labeling them as headwinds for global growth. Recent policy actions have disrupted established supply chains, slowing cross-border trade and weakening the short-term outlook for export-heavy economies. Amid these developments, the divergence between economic systems and behavioral responses has become more visible. Christian, founder of Infini, believes the disconnect is structural rather than cyclical. “We’re seeing three core dislocations: one, the cost of capital has reset higher but consumer and government behaviors haven’t fully adjusted. Two, global supply chains are attempting to regionalize under nationalist pressures, yet our systems are still priced for globalization. And three, fiat confidence is eroding slowly, but the alternatives, digital or commodity-backed systems, haven’t matured enough to absorb that flow.” Parallel concerns are surfacing around liquidity vulnerabilities. Tracy Jin, COO at MEXC, points to emerging fragilities in the bond market that could seep into broader risk asset pricing, including crypto. “We’re closely monitoring a synchronized bond sell-off across US and emerging markets, especially the ones triggered by either sticky inflation or a fiscal credibility crisis.” She notes that such scenarios, if left unchecked, could lead to a contraction in global liquidity and reduce the appetite for speculative assets. ETF flows mask deeper trends While traditional markets continue to react to inflation prints and central bank guidance, the crypto market is digesting a different cocktail, one that blends rising institutional interest with noticeable retail hesitation. The gap between these investor classes is becoming increasingly evident, especially when viewed through the lens of ETF participation, derivatives trends, and sentiment data. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index fell into “Extreme Fear” territory in April, typically a bearish signal. Yet Bitcoin defied this mood and climbed back toward $98,000. This dissonance between sentiment and price has puzzled retail investors but, according to Jin, can largely be explained by the nature of capital flows. “As Bitcoin approached $96,000, it underscores the bifurcation between sentiment and capital flows. ETF inflows from institutional channels have been a powerful counterforce to retail anxiety.” She believes that much of the current turbulence is driven externally rather than from within the crypto ecosystem. “We estimate that 60% of the current volatility can be accounted for by macro uncertainty, central bank ambiguity, and geopolitical risks. The rest can be accounted for from crypto-native elements, including miner capitulation post-halving and leveraged positioning in altcoins.” The mechanics of ETF flows themselves have added to the confusion. Greco argues that ETF activity tends to reflect market moves rather than anticipate them, often introducing a timing lag that distorts real-time analysis. “ETFs tend to mirror the broader market trend. During sharp declines, we typically see outflows, while strong rallies attract inflows. Many ETF products settle on a T+1 basis, meaning the reported flows usually correspond to the previous day’s activity.” From his perspective, institutional flows act more as accelerators of existing direction rather than as early indicators of reversal or breakout. Retail behavior, meanwhile, remains deeply reactive. Michael Cameron of Vanilla Finance highlights how crypto’s unique structure amplifies volatility during uncertain macro periods. “Crypto’s high liquidity makes it a prime target for rapid sell-offs during economic stress. Unlike real estate or bonds, cryptocurrencies can be sold instantly on exchanges, amplifying downward price movements. Whales are buying dips, and a dovish FED or softer CPI could spark a rebound.” Across the board, investors are parsing mixed signals. Institutional inflows may stabilize markets temporarily, but without clearer macro direction, both camps remain on edge, interpreting every data point, Fed speech, or CPI surprise as a possible turning point. No past model fits this cycle As recession probabilities rise and market uncertainty deepens, the question resurfaces, is crypto still a hedge, or has it been absorbed into the broader risk asset complex? Jin believes Bitcoin’s growing institutional base may support a more nuanced response than a simple correlation or detachment from traditional markets. “Bitcoin’s leverage lies in its maturing investor base, especially institutional participants via ETFs. As they could offer a partial buffer, we may see a nuanced decoupling. Broader equities could suffer a sharp pullback but Bitcoin could act less like a tech stock and more like a high-volatility hedge, especially if rate cut expectations increase.” While that interpretation allows for divergence under certain macro scenarios, others remain doubtful of a clean break. Greco points to the increasing overlap between crypto and traditional finance, driven by institutional adoption, as evidence that both systems are now deeply intertwined. “The general macro trends are usually similar. What really differs is the magnitude of the price swings between traditional finance and crypto, with the latter obviously experiencing much higher volatility in moments of high uncertainty. Looking at the past data point and the increasing commingling between the two markets, it looks unlikely that one sector might have a completely different pattern to the other.” Some argue that the framing of recession itself needs to be rethought. Christian suggests that Bitcoin should not be viewed as a counter-cyclical hedge, but rather as a monetary alternative built to respond to systemic failure. “A recession, in traditional terms, is a lagging indicator. But in first-principles terms, a recession is just a large-scale mispricing of risk and value, corrected through forced rebalancing. Bitcoin is what happens when a system opts out. It doesn’t need a soft landing — it is the hard alternative.” That framework gains sharper relevance when viewed through the lens of geopolitical shocks and prolonged policy failure. Cameron stresses that while Bitcoin may gain in the long term from failed monetary policy, it is not insulated from short-term market trauma. “The brief 2020 COVID recession saw crypto recover quickly due to stimulus and low rates, but a deeper, tariff-driven ‘Trumpcession’ could be different. Crypto has never endured a prolonged US recession since Bitcoin’s inception in 2009.” Market awaits a catalyst With the global macro backdrop still clouded by inflation, debt concerns, and geopolitical risk, market participants are shifting toward short-term caution while keeping one eye on longer-term opportunities. Bitcoin has rallied nearly 25% over the past month, largely driven by institutional spot buying and ETF inflows. However, early signs of fatigue are beginning to show. According to 10x Research, the Coinbase premium has dropped and funding rates have weakened, suggesting that momentum may be slowing. The report notes that Bitcoin is now consolidating near the $95,000 level, with traders awaiting clearer signals from the Federal Reserve’s upcoming decisions. “This is not a time for blind risk-taking but tactical positioning with well-defined exposure,” the research states, advising investors to consider hedging strategies as volatility creeps back in. Cameron believes that while short-term weakness remains a concern, structural drivers continue to support long-term growth. He sees recession fears and ETF outflows contributing to current volatility, but also points to positive underlying trends. Jin echoes that sense of cautious optimism. She expects Bitcoin to remain in a wide range as the market digests policy and liquidity signals. “Bitcoin may trade in the $88,000–$100,000 range as the market digests macro signals and ETF flow data. Our year-end target remains cautiously bullish at $128,000, with the assumption of zero black swan event.” Still, visibility remains limited. Greco describes the current price zone as crucial. “The market is currently sitting at a crucial level that could shape sentiment over the coming weeks. A decisive break above the $94,000–$95,000 range could restore confidence in a sustained bullish trend.” However, he stops short of any definitive forecast, noting that the cycle has already deviated from historical patterns. “This one has already broken precedent by reaching a new all-time high before the halving, something never seen before.” Christian suggests that the dominant market variable going forward may not be rate decisions or inflation data, but trust. “The key variable now isn’t earnings or even rates. It’s trust. Trust in sovereign debt, in fiat, in central bank forward guidance. That trust has been bleeding.” He sees Bitcoin and stablecoins as systems increasingly filling the vacuum left by waning institutional credibility. As crypto enters the next phase of its market cycle, clarity will likely hinge on central bank action, global liquidity conditions, and the durability of institutional flows. In the meantime, the market remains in a holding pattern. Summing it all up, risk is being recalibrated, conviction is being tested, and capital is watching for the next signal to move.

Canadian firm HIVE Digital Technologies is making a significant move, effectively doubling down on its commitment to Bitcoin Mining Paraguay . This isn’t just a short-term tactical play; according to HIVE CEO Aydin Kilic, the company views Paraguay as a crucial long-term partner, particularly for its abundant and low-cost clean energy. The decision to deepen roots in the South American nation highlights a growing trend among major mining operations to seek out sustainable and economically viable energy solutions. Paraguay, with its vast hydropower resources, presents a compelling case. Why is HIVE Digital Technologies Betting Big on Paraguay? HIVE Digital Technologies is no stranger to the global mining scene. Known for its focus on sustainable mining practices, the company has operations across various regions. However, the scale of their planned expansion in Paraguay signals a strategic pivot and a strong belief in the country’s potential. The core reasons cited by CEO Aydin Kilic for this significant investment are: Low-Cost Hydropower: Paraguay boasts some of the lowest electricity costs globally, thanks to its massive hydroelectric dams like Itaipu and Yacyretá. For energy-intensive Bitcoin mining, this is a game-changer for profitability. Political Stability: Compared to some other regions, Paraguay offers a relatively stable political and regulatory environment, which is crucial for long-term infrastructure investments. Supportive Policies: The government has shown interest in attracting energy-intensive industries, including cryptocurrency mining, recognizing the economic benefits and the potential to utilize surplus energy. This combination of factors makes Paraguay a highly attractive destination for large-scale mining operations looking for sustainable growth. Understanding the Scale of the Crypto Mining Expansion HIVE’s expansion isn’t incremental; it’s a substantial leap forward. The cornerstone of this growth is the acquisition of a 200 MW site from Bitfarms. This site is strategically located to leverage Paraguay’s energy infrastructure. The company has already completed the first phase, bringing 100 MW online. The ambitious plan doesn’t stop there. HIVE intends to scale the site up to its full 300 MW capacity. Concurrent with this power expansion is a significant increase in mining capacity, targeting 25 Exahashes per second (EH/s) by September 2025. To put this into perspective: 1 Exahash/second represents one quintillion (10^18) hashes per second. 25 EH/s is a substantial portion of the global Bitcoin network hashrate, positioning HIVE as a major player. This scale allows for greater efficiency and potential profitability, assuming favorable market conditions and energy costs. This rapid Crypto Mining Expansion demonstrates HIVE’s commitment to increasing its share of the global Bitcoin hashrate, crucial for earning block rewards and transaction fees. The Power of Paraguay Hydropower in Bitcoin Mining The focus on Paraguay Hydropower is central to HIVE’s strategy. Hydropower is a renewable energy source, meaning it doesn’t deplete natural resources and typically has a lower carbon footprint compared to fossil fuels. Paraguay generates significantly more hydroelectric power than it consumes, leading to a surplus that can be harnessed by energy-intensive industries like Bitcoin mining. Key advantages of using hydropower for mining include: Sustainability: Aligns with increasing calls for more environmentally conscious Bitcoin mining. Cost Predictability: Hydropower costs are often more stable and predictable than volatile fossil fuel prices. Abundance: Paraguay’s geography provides a consistent and large supply of hydroelectricity. By tapping into this resource, HIVE aims to achieve not only cost leadership but also bolster its reputation as a leader in sustainable mining practices. Pioneering Clean Energy Mining HIVE’s move in Paraguay is a clear example of the shift towards Clean Energy Mining within the cryptocurrency industry. As concerns about the energy consumption of Bitcoin mining grow, companies that can demonstrate a commitment to renewable sources gain a competitive advantage and appeal to a broader range of investors. HIVE’s approach involves: Utilizing hydropower in Paraguay and geothermal energy in Sweden. Investing in efficient mining hardware to reduce energy consumption per hash. Focusing on locations with abundant renewable energy potential. This strategy positions HIVE as a key player in the future of mining, where sustainability is expected to become increasingly important for regulatory acceptance and public perception. Strategic Pillars Beyond Energy While energy is a primary driver, HIVE’s strategy in Paraguay encompasses more than just cheap power. The company is also actively investing in local partnerships and engaging with policymakers. This proactive approach helps build stronger community relationships, navigate potential regulatory hurdles, and ensure long-term operational stability. Furthermore, maintaining global operations, even while focusing heavily on Paraguay, serves as a crucial hedge against geopolitical risks. Diversification across different regions with varying energy mixes and regulatory landscapes provides resilience against localized disruptions. What Does This Mean for the Future? HIVE’s significant investment in Bitcoin Mining Paraguay has several implications: For HIVE: It positions the company for substantial growth in hashrate and potentially lower operating costs, enhancing profitability. It also reinforces their commitment to sustainable mining. For Paraguay: It brings significant foreign investment, creates jobs, and helps utilize the country’s energy surplus, potentially spurring further infrastructure development. For the Mining Industry: It highlights Paraguay as a premier destination for large-scale, clean-energy mining, potentially attracting other players and accelerating the global shift towards renewables in the sector. The success of HIVE’s expansion will be closely watched as a case study for sustainable, large-scale crypto mining in emerging energy markets. Conclusion: A Bold Bet on Sustainable Growth HIVE Digital Technologies’ decision to significantly expand its operations in Paraguay is a bold statement about the future of Bitcoin mining. By leveraging the country’s abundant and low-cost hydropower, HIVE is not only aiming for massive operational scale (300 MW, 25 EH/s) but also reinforcing its commitment to Clean Energy Mining . This strategic move, supported by local engagement and global diversification, positions HIVE for long-term growth and solidifies Paraguay’s place as a key hub for sustainable crypto mining. The coming years, leading up to the September 2025 target, will be crucial in demonstrating the full potential of this ambitious Crypto Mining Expansion .

If XRP were to lose this support level, there’s a risk of a further crash until it reaches $1.6, as there isn’t a realistic support base between these levels. Nonetheless, an interesting technical indicator suggests that the cryptocurrency is headed for $9 by September 2025. Analyst Eyes $9 XRP Target Using Gann Angle Resonance Grid A crypto analyst recently posted a technical projection on the social media platform X, showcasing a long-term XRP price chart structured around the 1×1 Gann Angle Resonance Grid on the 3-day candlestick timeframe chart. According to the chart, the analyst anticipates XRP could reach a price target of $9.63 by early September 2025, aligning with the upper edge of the “Topping Channel” in the Gann grid. This projection stems from the intersection of the Gann channel’s resistance trendlines and a key Fibonacci market cap extension level at the 4.236 Fib, which the analyst identifies as a major confluence point. Related Reading: Analyst Says “XRP Is Back”, Here’s Why Although a $9 target might seem a lot, as it would be far higher than XRP’s current all-time high of $3.40, it is quite conservative compared to some more extravagant predictions circulating within the XRP community. However, the $9 projection is the most realistic target based on the Gann angle resonance grid. As it stands, the XRP price is in the mid-base zone, now at the cusp of entering the upper band called the topping channel. The technical structure of the rally resembles a stair-step progression, with each consolidation phase occurring near major grid lines. Strong Support At $1.60, But $9 In September Although the long-term outlook is a strong surge, there is also a need to consider the possibility of a short-term downside movement. If XRP fails to hold the mid-base level just above $2.00, the next structural support zone is around $1.60. Related Reading: XRP Price Shoots For 20% Surge To $2.51 Amid Pullback To Breakout Zone Notably, the grid-based projection places XRP reaching the $9 target sometime around September 7, 2025. However, even if a strong rally and stronger inflows were to push XRP to this point, this might not be done in a straight line but gradually through a series of breakouts and pullbacks. The greater the breakout, the greater the pullbacks. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.14, up by 2.14% in the past 24 hours with an intraday high of $2.17. Right now, all eyes are on whether it can break above the descending trendline that has capped its price movement into lower highs and lower lows in the past seven days.

Pi Network shows accumulation signals, while Chainlink aims for a breakout near $15. Both projects display movement, but their stories rely on technical strength rather than real-time use. Web3 ai stands apart by offering direct access to 12 AI-powered tools designed to support portfolio decisions, detect scams, and manage risk. Its $WAI token, now in presale, provides users access to this system. With clear demand and practical use, Web3 ai is rising as a top crypto to invest in for those focusing on utility over trend cycles. Pi Network Price Outlook: Accumulation Signals Surface Pi Network (PI) is trading at $0.6305, facing resistance at $0.6477. The RSI is currently 61.28, suggesting rising buying interest. Meanwhile, the ADX is high at 77.6, indicating a strong trend. However, a drop in trading volume by 39.63% to $92.82 million reflects reduced short-term activity. Over the last two days, more than 41 million PI tokens worth $27 million have moved out of exchanges like OKX. This outflow often signals accumulation, reducing available supply and hinting at potential upward price pressure if interest picks up. The project’s mainnet migration is also advancing, with 12 million users now onboarded. This rollout supports token access and ecosystem growth, which may influence long-term price direction. Chainlink Builds Toward $15: Can Momentum Hold? Chainlink (LINK) is now priced at $14.15, up 0.08% from its last close. The asset broke out from a bullish double-bottom pattern, with a daily close above $13.10 signaling further upside. Analysts now look at $15 as the next key target, a 20% increase from current prices. The RSI stands at 46.95, showing neutral conditions with potential for growth. Additional signs of strength include a Long/Short ratio of 1.031 and a funding rate of 0.0087%, suggesting long interest is outweighing short pressure. Still, trading volume has dropped by 25%, showing less participation. Key levels to watch include support at $13.10 and $12.94. The $15 resistance zone remains the test for confirming the breakout. Why Early Buyers See $WAI as a Strategic Entry Point Interest in Web3 ai’s $WAI token presale is increasing quickly as it becomes a strong candidate for utility-focused crypto development in 2025. Many investors are joining early, recognizing the important role $WAI plays in supporting AI-powered crypto tools. Web3 ai includes 12 active tools used for trading support, managing portfolios, spotting fraud, and assessing risk, all of which are now live and used by those who need accurate data. At the current presale price of $0.0003 per token, early buyers are looking at solid returns, as the launch price is fixed at $0.005242. This setup gives those joining now the chance at a 1747% return once the token goes public. Because of this, interest in Web3 ai continues to grow, with buyers responding to its strong product offering and the clear demand for its services. The $WAI token is more than just another crypto asset. It gives access to a working system with real tools made for active crypto users. As the presale phase approaches its final stage, and with strong potential upside, Web3 ai is becoming widely recognized as one of the top cryptos to invest in for this year. Utility in Focus: How Web3 ai Stands Apart in 2025 In a crowded crypto market, utility is becoming the main feature that separates strong projects from the rest. While names like Pi Network and Chainlink bring their own potential, Web3 ai takes a different approach by focusing on working solutions. With 12 AI-driven tools already live, the platform offers something direct and useful for those who trade and manage crypto assets. As the ai crypto presale gains more traction and early holders prepare for strong returns, the picture becomes clearer. Web3 ai is not following a trend. It is offering something practical that fits into a space demanding better tools and smarter systems. For this reason, it continues to gain attention as a solid option among the top cryptos to invest in this year.

Powell said straight up, “we won’t see further progress toward our goals,” if the tariffs stay at current levels. He spoke during a press briefing after the Fed wrapped up its May policy meeting in Washington, where officials voted to hold interest rates between 4.25% and 4.5%. That’s the same level they’ve kept since the last rate cut in December. The central bank is now stuck watching a slowing economy while inflation still threatens to rise. According to the Federal Open Market Committee, risks tied to both unemployment and inflation have gone up. Powell told reporters that the Fed is waiting for more information before making its next move, especially with uncertainty still hanging over the White House’s trade policy. “There’s so much uncertainty about the scale, scope, timing and persistence of the tariffs,” Powell said . He added that because of this, the Fed isn’t going to cut rates preemptively. “It’s not a situation where we can be preemptive, because we actually don’t know what the right responses to the data will be until we see more data,” Powell said. Powell says the Fed will wait before cutting rates When asked whether the Fed is putting more weight on inflation or unemployment right now, Powell didn’t give a straight answer. “It’s too early to know that,” he said. He also said the Fed’s current position is “moderately restrictive,” and that there’s no need to rush. “We think we can be patient,” Powell added. “This leaves us in a good place to wait and see.” But he also warned that if Trump’s tariffs stay in place, the Fed’s work could stall for at least a year. “We would not be making progress toward those goals — again, if that’s the way the tariffs shake out,” Powell said. He explained that the central bank’s twin mandates — stable prices and high employment — could both be affected. “The risks to higher inflation, higher unemployment have increased,” he said. Powell was clear about the stakes. If these tariffs are left as is, it might delay the Fed’s timeline for rate adjustments well into 2026. That means Americans could be stuck with high borrowing costs longer than expected. The Fed is not confident that the economy can fully rebound with the current trade policy in place. Powell warns tariffs could push inflation up and growth down Powell also warned that Trump’s trade strategy could slam the brakes on the economy. “If the large increases in tariffs that have been announced are sustained, they are likely to generate a rise in inflation, a slowdown in economic growth, and an increase in unemployment,” Powell said. The Fed chair explained that the inflation effects might be a one-time jump — but they could also last longer, depending on how the market reacts. “It is also possible that the inflationary effects could instead be more persistent,” he said. Even with all that risk, Powell said the Fed still believes its current stance is strong enough to respond when needed. “We believe that the current stance of monetary policy leaves us well positioned to respond in a timely way to potential economic development,” Powell said. The Fed chair’s comments came after a week of mixed economic signals. April payrolls showed some growth, but the latest GDP report showed weaker-than-expected numbers. Powell said the Fed needs to see how Trump’s policy decisions play out before it can adjust rates again. The Fed won’t guess. They want proof — real data, not hypotheticals. He also made it clear that there’s no playbook for what comes next. The tariffs could be lifted. They could expand. Or they could stay locked in for another year. And that’s exactly why the Fed is on hold. Powell said, “We don’t think we need to be in a hurry.” But if nothing changes in the White House’s trade stance, the central bank’s hands will stay tied.

Office Amid Shifting US Crypto Regulation,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-com-washington-dc/,"The world of cryptocurrency is constantly evolving, and major players are making strategic moves to navigate the complex landscape. One such significant development catching the eye of investors and industry watchers is Crypto.com’s latest expansion in the United States. As the realm of US crypto regulation continues to be a hot topic, the exchange is planting its flag firmly in the heart of American political power: Washington, D.C. Why Washington D.C. Now? Understanding Crypto.com’s Strategy Crypto.com’s decision to open an office in Washington D.C. isn’t just about having another address. It signals a clear intent to engage directly with policymakers and regulators. This move comes at a crucial time, as discussions around digital assets and their legal framework are intensifying within U.S. governmental circles. By establishing a physical presence in the capital, Crypto.com positions itself to be a more active participant in these critical conversations. This expansion builds upon Crypto.com’s existing U.S. strategy, which includes launching its headquarters in Texas. The combination of a strong operational base in Texas and a policy-focused office in D.C. demonstrates a comprehensive approach to tackling the American market. It’s not just about offering trading services; it’s about influencing the rules of the game. Ramping Up Crypto Lobbying Efforts The new D.C. office is a direct indicator that Crypto.com is significantly increasing its crypto lobbying efforts. Lobbying in Washington is essential for any industry seeking to influence legislation and regulatory frameworks. For the crypto sector, which is still relatively new and often misunderstood by traditional lawmakers, effective lobbying is paramount to ensuring fair and clear rules. Crypto.com’s enhanced lobbying push aims to educate officials about the benefits and potential of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, while also advocating for policies that foster innovation rather than stifle it. This proactive approach is becoming increasingly common among major crypto firms as they seek regulatory clarity and stability. Key areas where lobbying is likely to focus include: Defining different types of digital assets (e.g., securities vs. commodities). Developing clear rules for exchanges and custodians. Addressing concerns around consumer protection and market integrity. Promoting innovation while mitigating risks. Navigating the Shifting US Crypto Policy Landscape The timing of Crypto.com’s D.C. expansion is particularly noteworthy given the potential shifts in US crypto policy . Reports suggest a more favorable regulatory environment could be emerging, particularly under potential future Republican leadership. This perceived shift is encouraging major crypto companies to invest more heavily in their U.S. operations and advocacy. While regulatory outcomes are never guaranteed and bipartisan consensus is often required for significant legislative changes, the political climate surrounding crypto appears to be evolving. Companies like Crypto.com are positioning themselves to capitalize on this potential shift and help shape policies that could benefit the industry as a whole. Adding to this context, Crypto.com recently announced a partnership with Trump Media. While the specifics of the partnership, focused on developing crypto-focused ETFs, differ from direct lobbying, it highlights Crypto.com’s strategic engagement across various facets of the U.S. landscape, including areas that intersect with political figures and their ventures. This multifaceted approach underscores their commitment to establishing a strong foothold in the U.S. What Does This Mean for the Crypto Industry and Investors? Crypto.com’s move has several implications: Increased Industry Influence: A stronger presence and lobbying effort from a major exchange like Crypto.com can contribute to a more unified and effective voice for the crypto industry in Washington. Potential for Regulatory Clarity: Proactive engagement with policymakers can potentially lead to clearer, more predictable regulations, which is crucial for the long-term growth and adoption of cryptocurrencies. Competitive Landscape: Other major exchanges are also increasing their D.C. presence and lobbying efforts, indicating a competitive race to influence policy. Investor Confidence: Regulatory clarity often leads to increased investor confidence, potentially attracting more institutional and retail capital into the market. While challenges remain in navigating the complex web of U.S. agencies and jurisdictions involved in crypto regulation (SEC, CFTC, Treasury, etc.), Crypto.com’s investment in a D.C. office signals a serious commitment to being part of the solution and helping to define the future of digital assets in America. Conclusion: Crypto.com’s Strategic Bet on the U.S. Future Crypto.com’s expansion into Washington D.C. is a strategic and timely move. It underscores the exchange’s determination to not only grow its user base in the U.S. but also to actively participate in shaping the regulatory environment that will govern the future of cryptocurrency in the country. By ramping up its crypto lobbying efforts and positioning itself in the heart of political power, Crypto.com is making a significant bet on the potential for more favorable US crypto regulation and US crypto policy shifts. This development is a clear signal that major players in the crypto space view the U.S. as a critical market worth investing heavily in, both operationally and politically.

The observation is based on blockchain data that reveals a notable concentration of XRP tokens in a small number of large wallets. Concentration of XRP Among Top Wallets According to a post shared by the “All Things XRP” account, 25 wallets currently hold approximately 20.3 billion XRP tokens. This figure accounts for roughly 35% of the circulating supply of 58 billion, as reported by CoinMarketCap. The analyst suggests that this level of accumulation is indicative of growing confidence among high-net-worth individuals or institutional players in XRP’s long-term outlook. ARE THE ULTRA-RICH SECRETLY BETTING ON XRP? 25 wallets hold 20.3B XRP—37% of the entire circulating supply. Most are outside Ripple's escrow. Major exchanges like Binance & Uphold are stacked for wealthy clients. The billionaires aren’t talking—but their wallets… — All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) May 3, 2025 Blockchain data provided by XRPScan indicates that out of the top 20 XRP wallets with the highest balances, only eight are Ripple-controlled escrow wallets. Among the remaining 12 wallets, two are held directly by Ripple and together hold 2.525 billion spendable XRP tokens. The other ten wallets are affiliated with exchanges and trading platforms such as Binance , Upbit, Uphold, and Bithumb, where tokens are likely held on behalf of individual and institutional customers. While such high concentrations often raise concerns about centralization within a network, the “All Things XRP” analyst interprets the holdings as a signal that wealthy stakeholders are increasing their exposure in anticipation of potential future gains. Exchange Wallets and Wealth Attribution The analyst also emphasized that several of the largest XRP wallets are managed by centralized exchanges, but believes the size of these balances suggests they belong to affluent clients. He argues that ongoing accumulation patterns in these accounts are consistent with investment strategies employed by sophisticated investors who are positioning themselves ahead of a potential market shift. Whale Accumulation Trends Intensify Data from recent weeks supports this theory. As of April 28, wallets holding 20 million XRP or more had a cumulative balance of 36.859 billion tokens. That figure has since increased to 37.131 billion, indicating that these wallets acquired an additional 272 million XRP over a short time. At current market prices , each of these wallets holds more than $42 million in XRP. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 On a broader scale, analyst Ali Martinez has confirmed that addresses holding between 10 million and 100 million XRP have collectively acquired approximately 900 million tokens, worth an estimated $1.89 billion, over the past month. This suggests continued interest from larger players, even as XRP’s price remains relatively stable. Price Outlook and Market Sentiment Despite repeated attempts, XRP has struggled to maintain a position above the $2.20 level in recent weeks. At the time of writing, the token is trading around $2.12. However, the ongoing accumulation among large holders appears to reflect optimism about future price movement. While it remains uncertain whether XRP can break through key resistance levels in the near term, investor behavior suggests confidence in the asset’s medium-term to long-term potential. The accumulation trend across major wallets, combined with the large-scale holdings in centralized platforms, supports the view that a segment of the market, particularly the wealthier participants, is betting on an eventual upward breakout.

Bitcoin price extended gains on Wednesday as institutional investors continued to bet on imminent parabolic rally soon. The Federal Reserve maintained its lending rate between 4.25 and 4.5 percent on Wednesday, May 7. The Fed downplayed the immense pressure from the U.S. President Donald Trump to lower its benchmark interest rates, as the committee continues to judge the risks of higher unemployment and inflation caused by the ongoing trade wars. According to the announcement , the Fed will continue to reduce its holdings of Treasury securities, thus highlighting its bid on Quantitative Tightening (QT). However, the Fed noted that it will act appropriately in case of risk emergence to ensure maximum employment and reduce inflation to 2 percent. Midterm Expectations for Bitcoin Price Following the announcement, the wider crypto market recorded mild losses. After Bitcoin price teasing above $97k earlier on Wednesday, the flagship coin retraced slightly to trade about $96,156 during the mid-North American trading session. From a technical analysis perspective, Bitcoin price faces a short term bearish sentiment, especially after being rejected twice at the resistance level about $97.6k since the beginning of May. In the four-hour timeframe, Bitcoin price has been consolidating between $93,685 and $97k. If the flagship coin breaches the established support level around $93.6k, a drop towards $91k will be inevitable in the near future. However, a consistent close above $97k in the coming days will set the tone for a rally towards the all-time high above $100k. Closer Look at Whale Activity To understand the Bitcoin whale activity, it is prudent to study the U.S. spot BTC ETF market. In the past three weeks, the U.S. spot BTC ETFs have recorded a positive but declining cash flow. Nevertheless, Bitcoin maximalist investors – led by BlackRock’s IBIT, Strategy , and Metaplanet , among others – have continued to accumulate more BTC coins regardless of the underlying price volatility.Moreover, Bitcoin price is expected to follow Golf price action in the long haul, catalyzed by rising global money supply and high demand from institutional investors.",Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-07 19:16:06

The TRON network continues to grow Sam Elfarra, Community Spokesperson for TRON DAO, emphasized the importance of a reliable onramp for U.S. users. This aligns with its ambitious expansion plans, especially when it comes to facilitating payments. “Having TRX available for US users on MoonPay’s instant, programmable payments platform is a very positive development for our ecosystem. As a leader in payment and stablecoin solutions, MoonPay’s integration greatly enhances TRON’s trajectory as a global settlement network,” Sam Elfarra, TRON DAO.

The leadership shakeup sent the price of the network’s native MOVE token spiraling to a new all-time low. A Sudden Fall from Grace Movement announced Manche’s firing in a May 7 post on its official X account. However, the tweet offered few details beyond confirming his immediate departure and promising forthcoming governance changes. The 22-year-old was kicked out on the back of a CoinDesk story exposing secret agreements tied to MOVE’s token launch, including hidden advisor payments and questionable allocations to market makers. Citing internal documents and investor communications it had reviewed, the publication alleged that Manche played a central role in orchestrating a deal between Movement Foundation and an entity named Rentech, supposedly headed by Singapore-based financier Galen Law-Kun. Rentech was brought in to facilitate liquidity through Chinese market maker Web3Port. Under the agreement, Movement transferred 66 million MOVE tokens, approximately 5% of the circulating supply, under highly unconventional terms. One provision reportedly allowed the market maker to liquidate its holdings once MOVE’s valuation reached $5 billion, splitting the profits with the Movement Foundation. Legal analysts have since described the deal as reckless, pointing to its built-in incentives for manipulation. As CryptoPotato reported , Manche was placed on administrative leave on May 2, pending an external review by governance consultancy firm Groom Lake. The foundation’s general counsel, YK Pek, had previously criticized the Rentech deal in internal discussions, calling it “the worst deal I have ever seen.” But despite that warning, a revised agreement was still signed. For his part, Manche admitted to a lapse in judgement, saying he was misled by internal advisors and “opportunistic administrators” who, he claimed, operated as shadow decision-makers behind the scenes. Among the names surfacing in the aftermath is that of Zebec founder Sam Thapaliya, who has denied formal involvement in the token launch process, but was allegedly copied on sensitive emails and was also present at Movement’s San Francisco office when MOVE hit the market. In a lengthy personal statement posted on X on April 30, Manche wrote: “This has been a brutal few weeks,” adding that “Mistakes were made. We trusted wrong advisors, mms, and folks going into a bear market.” He also denied personally profiting from token sales and insisted that all market-making decisions were approved collectively by the foundation. Further, the co-founder hinted at internal power struggles and misaligned incentives, promising he would make further disclosures in time. Price Carnage The consequences for MOVE have been ugly. A few hours before this writing, as the market reacted to Manche’s dismissal, the token hit a new all-time low of $0.1566 per data from CoinGecko, a far cry from its $1.45 peak recorded in December 2024. The cryptocurrency is currently trading at $0.16, marking an 8.9% decline in the past 24 hours. Furthermore, over the past week, it has dropped 34.9% of its value, a sharp contrast to the global crypto market’s modest gain of 1.4% over the same period.

44291031,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158185,1746645631,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin: Why K33 Analysts Recommend a Bold ‘Hold in May’ Strategy,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-k33-hold-may/,"As the calendar flips to May, a familiar whisper echoes through traditional financial markets: ‘sell in May and walk away’. This old adage suggests that market performance tends to be weaker during the summer months (May to October). However, the world of cryptocurrency, particularly Bitcoin, often dances to its own tune. This year, prominent voices are challenging this conventional wisdom when it comes to digital assets. Specifically, K33 analysts are suggesting a different path entirely for the king of crypto, recommending investors ‘hold in May and stay’. Why Are K33 Analysts Challenging the ‘Sell in May’ Norm? The traditional ‘sell in May’ strategy is rooted in historical market data, suggesting investors might be better off selling stocks in May and reinvesting in the autumn. The reasoning often points to seasonal factors, holiday periods, and reduced trading volumes. But K33 analysts believe that 2024, and more significantly 2025, present a unique landscape for Bitcoin that may invalidate this historical pattern. Their BTC analysis points to specific, potentially powerful catalysts on the horizon. According to reporting by The Block, K33’s view isn’t just a contrarian stance for the sake of it. They see fundamental differences in the current market cycle and future outlook for Bitcoin compared to traditional assets. While stocks might follow seasonal trends influenced by broader economic cycles and investor behavior patterns established over decades, the crypto market is still relatively young and driven by different forces, including technological adoption, macroeconomic shifts, and increasingly, political developments. Exploring Potential Catalysts: What Drives K33’s Optimism? K33 analysts specifically highlighted potential ‘Trump-driven catalysts’ as a key reason why 2025 might see relative strength for Bitcoin. While the source material is concise, we can explore what potential political catalysts might influence the market: Regulatory Stance: A shift in the political administration’s stance on cryptocurrency regulation could significantly impact market sentiment and adoption. A more favorable or clearer regulatory environment could reduce uncertainty and attract institutional investment. Economic Policy: Broader economic policies, particularly concerning inflation, monetary policy, and national debt, can influence the appeal of Bitcoin as a hedge or alternative asset. Direct Commentary: Public statements or endorsements from influential political figures can sometimes have a surprising impact on market interest and price action, especially in a narrative-driven market like crypto. These potential factors, while subject to political outcomes and policy specifics, represent unique variables that K33 analysts believe could differentiate the upcoming period from typical market seasonality. Their Bitcoin price prediction seems to factor in these non-traditional elements. Understanding the ‘Hold in May and Stay’ Crypto Market Strategy So, what exactly does ‘hold in May and stay’ mean in practice for Bitcoin investors? It’s a straightforward approach: instead of selling assets based on the calendar month, K33 suggests maintaining or even potentially increasing exposure to Bitcoin through May and beyond. This strategy is predicated on the belief that the potential upside from upcoming catalysts outweighs the historical seasonal weakness seen in other markets. This perspective is particularly interesting given the volatility inherent in the crypto space. While traditional assets might see predictable dips, Bitcoin’s movements are often sharper and less tied to conventional patterns. The K33 view implies that for this cycle, the potential for positive developments (like the hinted catalysts) is significant enough to warrant riding out any potential short-term fluctuations that May might bring. Market Uncertainty: The U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Report Adding another layer to the market picture is the mention of the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve report. The source notes that the deadline for this report passed without a public announcement. The concept of a government potentially holding or strategizing around Bitcoin reserves is a significant one, suggesting increasing governmental interest and potential future involvement in the asset class. The lack of public information regarding this report adds an element of uncertainty to the market. Investors and analysts are left wondering about the report’s findings, recommendations, and potential implications for future U.S. policy or actions regarding Bitcoin. This opacity, while perhaps concerning to some, is part of the complex landscape that BTC analysis must navigate. Actionable Insights Based on K33’s Perspective For investors considering their next move, K33’s analysis offers a distinct viewpoint. It encourages a look beyond simple historical seasonality and towards forward-looking catalysts. While not financial advice, their perspective suggests: Don’t automatically assume May will be a weak month for Bitcoin just because it might be for stocks. Consider the potential impact of future political and regulatory developments on Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Recognize that market uncertainty, such as the lack of information on the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, is a factor but doesn’t necessarily negate the potential for upside driven by other forces. Ultimately, deciding on a crypto market strategy involves weighing various analyses and personal risk tolerance. K33’s ‘hold in May and stay’ is one professional perspective in a complex market. Challenges and Considerations While the potential for catalysts is exciting, it’s crucial to acknowledge the challenges and risks: Political Uncertainty: The nature and timing of ‘Trump-driven catalysts’ are inherently uncertain and depend on political outcomes that are far from guaranteed. Market Volatility: Bitcoin remains a highly volatile asset. Even with potential tailwinds, significant price swings are always possible. Unforeseen Events: Global macroeconomic shifts, regulatory crackdowns in other jurisdictions, or unforeseen events can impact the market regardless of specific catalysts. Therefore, any strategy, including holding through May, should be part of a well-thought-out investment plan that considers these factors. Conclusion: A Contrarian View for Bitcoin in May K33 analysts are presenting a compelling argument against the traditional ‘sell in May’ strategy for Bitcoin this year. Their ‘hold in May and stay’ recommendation is grounded in the anticipation of unique catalysts, particularly those potentially influenced by political developments in 2025, and acknowledges the current market uncertainties surrounding things like the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve report. This perspective highlights the evolving nature of the crypto market and suggests that its drivers are increasingly distinct from those of traditional finance. While seasonality might impact stocks, K33 believes forward-looking factors offer a stronger signal for Bitcoin’s potential performance, urging investors to consider staying the course rather than selling based on historical market adages.

Bessent addressed lawmakers at a May 7 hearing of the House Financial Services Committee, saying that the United States should be the “premier destination for digital assets” in response to a question about American dominance over China in crypto-related innovation. The Treasury Secretary added that “good market structure” and “stablecoin legislation” could help ensure this outcome. US Treasury Secretary speaking at a May 7 hearing. Source: Scott Bessent Bessent’s remarks echoed those of other Republican lawmakers and President Donald Trump, who initially claimed he wanted to make the US the “crypto capital of the world” during his 2024 campaign. The Treasury Secretary was likely referring to the draft of a digital asset market structure bill released by House Republicans on May 6 and the GENIUS bill to regulate stablecoins, expected to be taken up for a vote in the Senate on May 8. The Treasury Secretary, a Trump nominee, has stood by the president for significant announcements in crypto-aligned policy, including an executive order to establish a sovereign wealth fund and as a member of a working group to explore federal regulations for stablecoins and a national crypto stockpile. He suggested during a confirmation hearing that he would oppose the creation of any US-issued central bank digital currency while in office.

However, the dinner announcement seemed to galvanize some Democrats against any crypto-related legislation. Representative Maxine Waters, ranking member of the House Financial Services Committee, led a walkout of a hearing addressing the Republican-drafted crypto market structure bill on May 6, citing the need to explore “Trump’s crypto corruption.” A group of nine Democrats in the Senate likewise said they will not support the GENIUS stablecoin bill in its current form, suggesting stronger Anti-Money Laundering, foreign issuer, and national security safeguards. It’s unclear at the time of publication whether Republicans, who control both chambers, will still have the votes to pass either bill.

Despite a 16% price surge over the past month, key technical indicators reveal weakening bullish signals. The Ichimoku Cloud chart shows SOL hovering near critical support at $145, while its BBTrend metric—a measure of trend strength—has plummeted from 10.43 to 4.06 in three days. Institutional interest, including a $1 billion corporate treasury initiative, has not fully offset the growing skepticism. As Solana’s technical structure teeters, investors are pivoting to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a decentralized lending project gaining traction during its fourth presale phase. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale accelerates amid investor demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has entered its fourth presale stage, with tokens priced at $0.025 each. Over $7.7 million has been raised since the presale launched, fueled by the sale of 445 million tokens to more than 9,500 holders. Phase 4 is already 60% filled, signaling accelerating demand as buyers position themselves ahead of a 20% price hike in Phase 5. Once the current stage concludes, MUTM’s price will rise to $0.03, offering immediate paper gains for Phase 4 participants. The project’s tokenomics outline a listing price of $0.06, translating to a 140% return for those buying at the current rate. Post-launch forecasts suggest further upside, with analysts projecting MUTM could climb to $3.50—a 14,000% leap—as its lending platform gains adoption. This potential stems from Mutuum Finance’s unique model, which integrates overcollateralized loans, dynamic interest rates, and a buyback system that redistributes tokens to stakers. Unlike speculative assets, MUTM ties its value to real-world utility, creating sustained demand through its mtTokens mechanism, which generates passive income for liquidity providers. Strategic incentives drive sustained growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is amplifying investor confidence through strategic initiatives. A recently launched dashboard now features a leaderboard ranking the top 50 token holders, who receive bonus rewards for maintaining their positions. This system not only incentivizes long-term holding but also fosters competition among participants, further tightening token supply. Meanwhile, the team is finalizing a smart contract audit with CertiK, a milestone expected to bolster credibility once results are shared publicly. The project’s presale structure deliberately escalates prices across 11 phases, creating urgency as each stage sells out. Early buyers in Phase 4 secure tokens at the lowest available price before the next increase, a tactic that has already propelled rapid fundraising. With Phase 5 approaching, the window for accessing MUTM below $0.03 is narrowing. Solana’s challenges highlight shift toward utility-focused tokens As Solana (SOL) contends with faltering momentum, its struggles underscore a broader market shift toward projects offering tangible utility. While SOL maintains its lead in DEX volume, its inability to sustain bullish signals has left investors exploring alternatives. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) capitalizes on this trend, merging decentralized finance (DeFi) innovation with measurable economic incentives. The platform’s lending model, which requires borrowers to lock collateral exceeding loan values, minimizes default risks while stabilizing the ecosystem. Coupled with peer-to-peer (P2P) lending options for assets like meme coins, Mutuum Finance addresses gaps left by traditional DeFi protocols. These features, combined with a token buyback system funded by platform revenue, create a self-reinforcing cycle of demand and scarcity. Final call: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) nears next presale stage With Phase 4 rapidly filling, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents a rare convergence of accessibility and high-growth potential. Current investors stand to gain 140% returns at launch, while post-launch targets suggest exponential upside. The project’s focus on security, evidenced by the ongoing CertiK audit, and its reward mechanisms for top holders further differentiate it in a competitive crypto market. As Solana (SOL) navigates uncertainty, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) emerges as a calculated alternative for those prioritizing utility and structured returns. The presale’s upward pricing trajectory leaves little room for hesitation, urging investors to act before Phase 5 begins.

The update aims to streamline staking, enhance wallet functionality, and improve overall efficiency. It arrives as Ethereum contends with rising competition and internal debates over its direction. A key element of the upgrade involves increasing the amount of ETH one can stake from 32 to 2,048. This change could help speed up and streamline operations for stakers, the vast network of companies and individuals who help keep the Ethereum network afloat.

For readers in the Bitcoin World community, who appreciate disruptive tech and its potential impact, Netflix’s latest move is particularly interesting. The company has officially unveiled its new Netflix AI -powered search tool, a development that promises to transform the user experience. Exploring the Power of Generative AI in Search Netflix announced this significant update at its recent tech and product event, following hints during its earnings call. The core of this new feature lies in its use of Generative AI , specifically leveraging OpenAI’s ChatGPT technology. This integration is designed to move beyond traditional keyword searches, enabling a more intuitive and conversational discovery process for users. Instead of typing specific titles or genres, users can now interact with the platform using natural language. This means you can express your mood or specific preferences in phrases that feel more like talking to a friend. For instance, a user might input something like, “I want something funny and upbeat,” or articulate more nuanced requests such as, “I want something scary, but not too scary, and maybe a little bit funny, but not haha funny.” The generative AI understands these complex descriptions and aims to provide relevant suggestions. How the New AI Search Enhances Discovery The primary goal of this advanced AI Search tool is to make finding content easier and more personalized. By understanding the context and subtleties of natural language, the AI can potentially surface hidden gems or shows that a user might not have found through conventional browsing or keyword searches. This could significantly improve user engagement and satisfaction by reducing the time spent scrolling and increasing the likelihood of finding something truly enjoyable. The rollout of this feature is beginning this week for iOS users as an opt-in beta. It’s worth noting that some users in Australia and New Zealand reportedly had early access to this functionality last month, indicating a phased testing approach before a wider release. This beta phase allows Netflix to gather valuable feedback and refine the AI’s performance before making it available to its entire user base. Comparing Netflix’s Approach to Other Streaming Service Innovations Netflix isn’t the only Streaming Service exploring the potential of generative AI in search and discovery. Competitors are also experimenting with similar technologies. Amazon, for example, offers an AI voice search experience on its Fire TVs that can respond to open-ended inquiries about movies and TV shows. This shows a broader industry trend towards more intuitive, AI-driven interfaces. A particularly relevant comparison is Tubi’s past venture into AI search. Tubi previously launched a ChatGPT-powered search tool that allowed users to ask content-related questions and receive movie suggestions based on detailed requests, much like Netflix’s new feature. However, Tubi later discontinued this tool, reportedly due to low user adoption. This presents a potential challenge for Netflix – ensuring their AI search is genuinely useful and adopted by users, rather than becoming a niche feature. Leveraging ChatGPT and Future AI Plans The decision to integrate ChatGPT highlights Netflix’s commitment to using state-of-the-art AI models. The power of large language models like ChatGPT lies in their ability to understand and generate human-like text, which is crucial for a natural language search interface. The success of this feature will heavily rely on the AI’s accuracy in interpreting user intent and the quality of the recommendations it provides. Beyond the search tool, Netflix also revealed other ways it plans to utilize generative AI. At the tech and product event, the company mentioned plans to use AI to update title cards for shows and movies in users’ preferred languages. This application of AI demonstrates how the technology can be used to enhance localization and personalization across various aspects of the platform, improving the experience for a global audience. Conclusion: What This Means for the Future of Streaming Netflix’s debut of its generative AI-powered search tool is a significant step in the evolution of streaming platforms. By moving towards conversational, natural language interactions powered by AI, Netflix aims to make content discovery more seamless and enjoyable. While challenges remain, particularly regarding user adoption and competition, this move signals a future where AI plays a central role in personalizing and simplifying our digital entertainment experiences. It will be fascinating to observe how users respond to this new way of searching and whether it sets a new standard for the streaming industry.

To read full editions, subscribe . The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) today, as expected, kept interest rates unchanged. Committee members cited a “stabilized” unemployment rate, “solid” labor market and continued elevated inflation. However, they noted there’s now an increased risk that unemployment and inflation will rise in the coming months. Stocks were mostly flat on the news. The S&P 500 was up 0.2% on the day, as of 2:30 pm ET. The Nasdaq Composite was trading 0.3% lower. “If the tariffs that have been announced are sustained, they’re likely to generate a rise in inflation, a slowdown in economic growth and increase in unemployment reflecting a one-time shift in the price level,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said shortly before publication. The Fed’s focus on the unemployment rate in today’s statement suggests that a so-called “Fed put” (the central bank stepping in to lower rates and prevent a sharp market decline) will not come until — or unless — the labor market starts to deteriorate. In other words, should tariffs spur significant layoffs, we could be looking at an interest rate cut sooner rather than later. Committee members did not release projection materials this month, so it’s hard to know how they’re thinking about the impact of new and pending tariffs. In March, FOMC members indicated they still expect two cuts in 2025. It’s been a tumultuous six weeks for markets since the Fed’s last meeting in March. Stocks whipsawed along with President Trump’s tariff policies at the beginning of April — rising and falling as optimism over trade deals fluctuated. In the past couple of weeks, though, major indexes have erased their “Liberation Day” losses. As of Tuesday’s close, the S&P 500 was up 0.5% from April 2. The Nasdaq Composite gained 2.8% in that period, no doubt benefiting from tech giants’ positive Q1 earnings . Investors are, apparently, confident that the looming trade war won’t be so bad after all. Pushing the start date for most tariffs on foreign imports and granting exemptions for the select tech and auto levies helped markets rally. While fears around tariff impact may be easing, analysts warn that many of the trade policies — and their impact on prices, consumer spending and the labor market — remain to be seen. In a constantly changing situation, traders must be cautious to give credence to any single statement. Case in point: Trump just after 2 pm ET said he wasn’t open to lowering the 145% tariff rate on China. This comes hours after China said it agreed to meet with the White House. The decision comes after weeks of President Trump urging Powell to cut rates. Trump quelled fears that he’d attempt to remove Powell, but tension between the two remains. Since November, Powell has been consistent in his stance that he will be waiting and watching the data before making any decisions. So don’t expect committee members to cut rates on headlines.

The company has officially joined forces with major players in the traditional finance sector: Kyobo Securities in South Korea and a key subsidiary of Japan’s SBI Group. This move, announced via Witch’s official X account, signals a serious acceleration plan for their ambitious RWA platform . For those following the convergence of traditional finance and blockchain, this is a compelling development. Witch, known for its work in the NFTs space, is now positioning itself at the forefront of bringing tangible value onto the blockchain. Partnering with established financial institutions like Kyobo Securities and a powerful entity within the SBI Group lends significant credibility and opens doors to vast networks and potential real-world assets. Why are these Partnerships a Game Changer for Witch Crypto? The collaboration between Witch and these financial giants isn’t just a handshake deal; it’s a strategic alignment designed to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning world of tokenized assets. Here’s why these partnerships are particularly impactful for Witch crypto : Credibility and Trust: Partnering with well-regarded institutions like Kyobo Securities and a subsidiary of SBI Group instantly enhances Witch’s standing. These entities operate under strict regulations and have decades of experience in financial markets, bringing a level of trust that is crucial for mainstream RWA adoption. Access to Real-World Assets: Financial institutions have direct access to a wide array of potential RWAs, including real estate portfolios, art collections, intellectual property, commodities, and financial instruments like bonds and equities. These partnerships can provide Witch with a pipeline of high-value assets to tokenize on their platform. Regulatory Navigation: Operating in the RWA space requires navigating complex and often evolving regulatory environments, particularly in markets like South Korea and Japan. Kyobo Securities and SBI Group possess invaluable expertise in these areas, which can help Witch ensure compliance and build a sustainable, legally sound platform. Market Reach and Distribution: These partnerships offer Witch access to established customer bases and distribution channels within the traditional finance sector, potentially accelerating user adoption and the liquidity of tokenized assets. Technological Synergy: While Witch brings blockchain and tokenization expertise, the financial partners can offer insights into existing market infrastructure, security requirements, and client service standards that are essential for building a robust RWA platform . Understanding the Players: Kyobo Securities and SBI Group To fully appreciate the significance of this announcement, it’s helpful to understand the background of Witch’s new partners: Kyobo Securities: A prominent financial services firm in South Korea. They are part of the larger Kyobo Group, a major conglomerate with interests spanning insurance, finance, and other sectors. Kyobo Securities has a strong presence in brokerage, investment banking, and asset management within the Korean market. Their involvement suggests a focus on bringing Korean-based real-world assets or investors onto Witch’s platform. SBI Group: A diversified Japanese financial services company known for its early and significant embrace of blockchain technology and digital assets. SBI Group has various subsidiaries involved in banking, securities, asset management, and venture capital, with a notable focus on crypto and blockchain through entities like SBI Holdings and SBI VC Trade. The partnership with an SBI Group subsidiary indicates a potential focus on the Japanese market and leveraging SBI’s extensive experience in the digital asset space. These partnerships strategically position Witch to tap into two major Asian markets with established financial infrastructure and growing interest in digital assets and tokenization. What Exactly Are Real-World Assets (RWA) and Why Tokenize Them? The term RWA platform refers to a system designed to tokenize assets that exist outside the digital native world of cryptocurrencies and NFTs. Think of anything with tangible or verifiable value in the physical or traditional financial world. Examples include: Real Estate (commercial buildings, residential properties, land) Art and Collectibles (paintings, rare artifacts, luxury goods) Commodities (gold, oil, agricultural products) Financial Instruments (stocks, bonds, private equity, debt) Intellectual Property (music rights, patents, royalties) Natural Resources (timber, mineral rights) Tokenizing these assets involves creating a digital representation (a token, often an NFT for unique items or fungible tokens for divisible assets) on a blockchain. This token represents ownership or fractional ownership of the underlying real-world asset. The benefits of tokenizing RWAs are numerous: Benefit Explanation Increased Liquidity Traditionally illiquid assets (like real estate) can be traded more easily on digital marketplaces, opening them up to a wider pool of buyers and sellers globally. Fractional Ownership High-value assets can be divided into smaller, affordable tokens, allowing more people to invest in portions of expensive items like a piece of art or a large property. Transparency and Auditability Blockchain records provide a transparent and immutable history of ownership and transactions. Accessibility Tokenization can lower barriers to entry for investors who might not have access to traditional investment channels or the capital required for direct ownership. Reduced Costs and Speed Streamlining processes like verification, transfer, and settlement can reduce fees and transaction times compared to traditional methods. The rise of RWA tokenization is seen by many as the next major wave in blockchain adoption, potentially bringing trillions of dollars in value onto decentralized networks. Witch’s move to accelerate its RWA platform is directly aligned with this significant market trend. How Do NFTs Fit into Witch’s RWA Strategy? Witch started as a multi-chain NFTs platform. While some RWAs might be represented by fungible tokens (like tokenized shares of a company), unique assets like a specific property, a piece of art, or a luxury watch are often best represented by Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). An NFT ensures that each token is distinct and verifiable, perfectly suited for proving ownership of a unique real-world item. Witch’s existing expertise and infrastructure for handling NFTs could be a significant advantage in developing its RWA platform . They already have experience with digital asset creation, marketplaces, and potentially linking digital tokens to off-chain information or legal frameworks. The platform could leverage its NFT technology for: Tokenizing unique real estate properties or fractional shares of a single property. Creating verifiable digital certificates of authenticity and ownership for art and collectibles. Representing unique intellectual property rights or licenses. By combining their NFT foundation with the financial and regulatory expertise brought by Kyobo Securities and SBI Group , Witch is building a comprehensive ecosystem for tokenizing and managing a wide variety of real-world assets. What Challenges Lie Ahead for the Witch Crypto RWA Platform? While the potential is immense, building a successful RWA platform , even with strong partners, comes with significant challenges: Regulatory Hurdles: This is perhaps the biggest challenge. Tokenizing traditional assets intersects with existing securities, property, and contract laws, which vary significantly by jurisdiction (South Korea and Japan included). Ensuring full compliance and navigating potential regulatory changes will be ongoing work. Legal Frameworks: Establishing clear legal links between the digital token and the underlying physical asset is crucial. This involves creating robust legal contracts and ensuring that token holders have enforceable rights to the real-world asset. Valuation and Appraisal: Accurately valuing illiquid assets and providing reliable, transparent appraisal methods for their tokenized versions can be complex. Custody and Management: Securely managing the underlying physical assets represented by the tokens, as well as the digital tokens themselves, requires robust infrastructure and trusted processes. Market Adoption: Educating traditional investors and institutions about the benefits and mechanics of tokenized assets, and encouraging adoption, will take time and effort. Technical Integration: Seamlessly integrating blockchain technology with existing financial systems and asset management processes is a complex technical undertaking. The involvement of Kyobo Securities and SBI Group significantly mitigates some of these challenges, particularly regarding regulatory navigation and access to existing financial infrastructure, but they do not eliminate them entirely. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for Investors and the Market? For those interested in the crypto market, blockchain technology, or traditional finance, Witch’s partnerships offer several key takeaways: Growing RWA Trend: This news reinforces the increasing institutional interest and momentum behind real-world asset tokenization. It’s a sector poised for significant growth. Bridging TradFi and DeFi: Collaborations like this are vital for bridging the gap between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi), potentially bringing new capital and use cases to the blockchain space. Opportunity in Asian Markets: The focus on South Korea (via Kyobo Securities ) and Japan (via SBI Group ) highlights the potential for these regions to become significant hubs for RWA tokenization.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/researcher-warns-against-not-holding-xrp-heres-why/,"The recent increase in XRP wallet activity has prompted market observers to issue warnings to those still on the sidelines. Rob Cunningham, a market researcher and writer, has argued that failing to invest in XRP at this stage could prove to be a major missed opportunity, especially as adoption indicators continue to strengthen. Growth in Wallets Holding 10,000 XRP or More According to on-chain data from Glassnode, the number of wallets containing at least 10,000 XRP tokens has surpassed 300,000 for the first time. This milestone represents a significant increase in larger holders, despite the ongoing volatility in the broader crypto market. The asset has struggled to maintain support above the $2.2 mark, with four consecutive days of price declines from May 2 to May 5. Although XRP saw a modest rebound on May 6, it remains under pressure below $2.2, often flipping between acting as resistance and support. Despite this uncertainty, the growing number of addresses with substantial holdings suggests many investors are taking advantage of the current prices to accumulate more XRP. Community Commentary on Whale Behaviour Software engineer and prominent XRP community member Chad Steingraber has highlighted the growing number of whale wallets as a sign of increasing investor confidence. He believes this trend, if sustained, could exert upward pressure on the token’s value in the coming months. In response to these developments, Cunningham conducted an AI-assisted analysis of the wallet distribution. He estimates that of the 300,000 wallets, a significant portion may belong to the same individuals. By his calculation, the actual number of unique holders of wallets with 10,000 XRP or more may be closer to 200,000. Thank you, @ChadSteingraber ! You triggered me to do a @grok search with your post below! “Approximately 0.0032% of the world's adult population (200,000 out of ~6.19 billion adults) owns more than 10,000 XRP. This is a tiny fraction, reflecting the niche nature of cryptocurrency… https://t.co/GEelwGG9uQ — Rob Cunningham | KUWL.show (@KuwlShow) May 4, 2025 Early Adoption Suggests Room for Growth Cunningham emphasized the relative scarcity of high-balance XRP holders when compared to the global adult population. His estimate indicates that only around 0.0032% of adults currently hold 10,000 or more XRP tokens. This low penetration rate, according to him, reinforces the argument that the token remains in the early stages of adoption, even over a decade since its creation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This underrepresentation, in his view, highlights a potential entry point for new investors. Cunningham argues that individuals without XRP exposure are at a disadvantage, especially if predictions about the asset’s future valuation prove accurate. In his words, “the worst place for anyone to be right now is with No Wallet and No XRP” Price Projections Fuel Optimism Several analysts continue to share optimistic long-term price targets for XRP. Last month, market commentator Cryptominder projected that XRP could reach $50 by 2030, a gain of over 2,200% from the current trading price of $2.13. Other analysts are even more bullish, suggesting that a $100 valuation is possible within the decade, driven by increasing adoption and potential regulatory clarity. As the market monitors further developments, the growing interest in XRP from larger holders may serve as a signal for retail investors evaluating whether to enter or expand their positions.

A total of 2 billion SNS tokens (20% of the total supply) will be distributed via airdrop during the Genesis phase. 1.5 billion of these will be allocated to approximately 275,000 wallets that hold .sol domain names at the time of the snapshot. Individual domain owners will be able to apply to benefit directly from this distribution. The remaining 500 million tokens will be donated to ecosystem members to support the development of the SNS community. The project claims that the distribution model adopts the principle of “no pre-sale, no private sale”, and announced that the initial amount to be put into circulation will be only 25% of the total supply.

Priced at $0.1733, it remains a favorite among enthusiasts despite recent market dips. Highlighting its innovative edge, DogeOS, a new platform designed to enhance the Dogecoin blockchain, recently secured $6.9 million in funding. While these developments showcase Dogecoin’s enduring relevance, Ruvi offers an entirely new frontier for investors ready to seize early opportunities for outsized returns. Dogecoin’s Evolution and Ruvi’s Emerging Opportunity Dogecoin’s community-drive and utility have fueled its status as the go-to meme cryptocurrency. The recent $6.9 million investment in DogeOS aims to further strengthen Dogecoin’s ecosystem by enabling consumer-focused applications. However, this technical growth hasn’t significantly impacted DOGE’s price trajectory, which has remained relatively stable over time. For investors seeking heightened growth potential, Ruvi presents an enticing alternative. Its capped token supply of 1.5 billion, paired with an affordable presale price of $0.01 per token, creates the foundation for explosive value increases. Ruvi’s focus on utility via decentralized monetization and AI-driven tools adds to its allure. Ruvi’s Bonus Structure and Investment Scenarios Ruvi’s presale stands out with its sliding bonus structure, rewarding those who act quickly and decisively. These bonuses not only multiply holdings but also create a compounding effect as Ruvi’s value grows post-launch. Here’s how your investment might play out under this structure. Entry-Level Investor ($300) A $300 investment at the presale price of $0.01 per token yields 30,000 tokens. With a 20% bonus applied, you receive an extra 6,000 tokens, totaling 36,000. If Ruvi reaches $2 per token in the future, your portfolio would grow to $72,000. Mid-Tier Investor ($750) Investing $750 buys you 75,000 tokens at the presale price. A 40% bonus adds another 30,000 tokens, creating a total of 105,000 tokens. If Ruvi hits $3 per token, this translates to a substantial $315,000. High-Tier Investor ($5,000) For those willing to commit $5,000, you’d initially secure 500,000 tokens. Ruvi’s 100% bonus for investments at this tier doubles your holdings to 1 million tokens. A modest price increase to $2 per token would transform your investment into a remarkable $2 million. These scenarios illustrate the outsized potential of Ruvi’s presale model, even within conservative price predictions. Benefits of Getting in Early Ruvi’s presale phase represents a rare opportunity to buy in before widespread adoption. Unlike Dogecoin, which has already achieved global recognition, Ruvi is just beginning its lifecycle, leaving room for early participants to secure the most significant gains. Ruvi’s capped supply ensures token scarcity, while its utility-focused features position it uniquely in emerging markets like decentralized content and AI integrations. By acting now, investors can benefit from the bonus structure and the lowest possible token prices. The Final Word Dogecoin’s continued growth and ecosystem expansion are a testament to its staying power, but Ruvi opens the door to an entirely different set of possibilities. Whether you’re investing small or going all in, Ruvi’s presale offers exceptional potential for early backers. Don’t miss out. Join Ruvi’s presale today to secure your stake and be part of what could be the next big breakthrough in cryptocurrency. Timing is critical, and opportunities like this don’t knock twice.

These documents were made public by Coinbase through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. The New York Attorney General’s Request Revealed In June 2023, Shamiso Maswoswe, a New York State Attorney General’s chief official, emailed the SEC requesting the agency to assist in a legal matter involving Ethereum. The legal case was part of a lawsuit against crypto exchange KuCoin . The case claimed Ethereum was being sold as an unregistered security. However, the case outcome would not depend on the SEC’s opinion. The New York Attorney General’s office had jurisdiction over securities and commodities. However, Maswoswe believed the SEC’s support would help protect investors and shape future legal decisions about cryptocurrencies. Whether a cryptocurrency is seen as a security is very important. A security classification would place a cryptocurrency under the SEC’s jurisdiction. That means stricter rules and more government oversight. Meanwhile, the debate over whether Ethereum is a security has been ongoing for years and significantly affects how it is regulated. Gary Gensler’s Views on Ethereum The debate about whether Ethereum is a security started when Gary Gensler was the SEC chair. Gensler was known for his cautious approach toward cryptocurrencies. Although he did not make a clear statement on whether Ethereum should be considered a security , he claimed that many digital assets should fall under the SEC’s jurisdiction. Under Gensler’s leadership, the SEC investigated Ethereum 2.0, a major update for the Ethereum blockchain, which raised concerns within the crypto community. Gensler’s tenure was considered too tough on the crypto industry and stifled innovation and growth. In addition to Ethereum, the documents also show that the SEC discussed whether XRP should be considered a security. An email from 2021 asked if the risks to XRP’s blockchain would increase if Ripple, the company behind XRP, “disappeared.” This shows the SEC’s concern about the future of XRP and the ongoing legal fight with Ripple. SEC Takes New Approach to Crypto Regulation Since these documents were public, the SEC has changed its approach toward crypto regulation. Under new leadership, the agency has dropped charges against major players in the crypto industry, including Coinbase. While the SEC still wants to regulate the crypto industry, it now seems more willing to listen and talk with crypto companies.

In an environment where trends emerge and vanish in hours, the right tools can help users identify promising tokens early, track smart money flows, and execute trades before the broader market catches on. We present the top 5 crypto tools for discovering early-stage gems and hidden alphas in 2025, in which Bitget Wallet Alpha topped the list. 1. Bitget Wallet Alpha: The Ultimate Alpha Hunting Hub With its integrated discovery engine, real-time alerts, and seamless multi-chain trading, Bitget Wallet Alpha offers one of the most complete platforms for finding and acting on alpha in one place. Evolved from MemeX, it combines token discovery, analytics, and instant swaps across 130+ chains. Key Features: Real-Time Discovery: Bitget Wallet Alpha curates trending tokens and early-stage projects through its Hot Picks Leaderboard, pulling insights from onchain activity, volume spikes, and alert frequency. Alpha Signals Engine: The platform tracks factors like 5-minute wallet spikes, early bonding activity, and alert momentum to identify tokens with breakout potential. Maximum Gain Display: Users can see the highest percentage gain reached post-alert, helping evaluate whether a token still offers upside or has peaked. Cross-Chain Execution: The integrated Super DEX allows one-tap trading across Ethereum, Solana, Base, Arbitrum, and many more, with optimized routing for best price and minimal slippage. Simplified Gas Payments: Bitget’s GetGas feature lets users pay fees in stablecoins like USDT or USDC, eliminating the need to manage native gas tokens. Moreover, Bitget Wallet Alpha ’s mobile-first experience enables fast discovery and execution without jumping between tools—a game-changer for traders who rely on speed. 2. DexScreener: A Chart-Lover’s Dream for Spotting Breakouts DexScreener remains a favorite among traders looking for multi-chain analytics and breakout token tracking. It offers robust charting tools, real-time pair rankings, and deep liquidity insights. Key Features: Multi-Chain Coverage: DexScreener monitors thousands of tokens across Ethereum, BNB Chain, Solana, Arbitrum, Polygon, and more. Hot Pair Rankings: The platform surfaces the most active trading pairs across chains, highlighting sudden volume spikes and price moves. Custom Filters: Users can screen by liquidity, age, market cap, or volatility to find under-the-radar tokens gaining traction. While DexScreener is excellent for research and monitoring, it lacks integrated execution and wallet features, making it best as a companion tool to wallets like Bitget Alpha. 3. ave.ai: Smart Money and Narrative Explorer ave.ai specializes in surfacing alpha through smart money tracking and narrative monitoring, making it ideal for traders who follow capital flows and emerging themes. Key Features: Smart Money Wallet Tracking: ave.ai tracks influential wallets, showing where large or sophisticated players are allocating funds in real time. Narrative Dashboards: The platform organizes alpha by narrative (AI, RWA, GameFi, Memecoins), making it easier to align trades with market sentiment. Pre-Launch and Bonding Tokens: ave.ai identifies projects still in bonding or presale phases, offering ultra-early access for high-risk, high-reward hunters. However, ave.ai does not include trading functions, so users need to combine it with an execution platform to act on signals. 4. Axiom: The Alpha Engine for On-Chain Intelligence Axiom has emerged as one of the most advanced platforms for on-chain data querying and insight generation. Built for power users, it allows traders and researchers to uncover hidden patterns and alpha signals directly from blockchain data. Key Features: On-Chain Querying: Axiom enables advanced data queries to track wallet movements, token distributions, contract activity, and more. Custom Alerts: Users can set up personalized triggers to be notified when specific on-chain events or wallet behaviors occur. Developer-Friendly Tools: With its smart contract integration and flexible APIs, Axiom empowers traders to automate strategies and run custom analytics. Although Axiom is incredibly powerful, it requires a learning curve and is best suited for data-driven traders or developers who want to build tailored alpha tools. 5. DEXTools: Reliable OG for DeFi Trading Intel DEXTools remains one of the most widely used DeFi data platforms, offering real-time insights across major DEXs. It’s particularly popular among Ethereum traders looking to catch fresh liquidity pools and token launches. Key Features: Pool Explorer: DEXTools lets users track newly created liquidity pools on Uniswap, Sushiswap, PancakeSwap, and more. Km Whale Tracking: The platform highlights large trades and wallet movements, offering early clues about emerging tokens. DEX Score and Safety Metrics: Built-in analytics rank tokens based on liquidity, transaction history, and contract health. While DEXTools offers powerful analytics, it lacks direct trading functions, making it another platform best paired with a wallet or aggregator. Conclusion: Bitget Wallet Alpha Leads the Pack When it comes to finding early-stage crypto gems and hidden alphas, Bitget Wallet Alpha stands out as the most comprehensive tool. Its combination of discovery, analytics, execution, and security in one seamless package makes it the go-to choice for traders who want to act quickly and confidently. While platforms like DexScreener, ave.ai, Birdeye, and DEXTools offer valuable insights, none match the all-in-one convenience and mobile-first execution of Bitget Wallet Alpha. For traders seeking to stay ahead of the curve and capture explosive opportunities, Bitget Wallet Alpha is the clear winner in 2025.

In a new court filing , Mashinsky’s lawyers say that the government paints an unfair picture that makes it seem like he’s a monster rather than a first-time non-violent offender. “The Court should impose a sentence of no more than 366 days. The government’s venom-laced submission recasts this case as one involving a predator with an intent to ‘target’ victims, ‘harm’ them, and ‘steal’ their money. It concludes by recommending that a first-time, non-violent offender who pled guilty and accepts responsibility receive a death-in-prison sentence.” The lawyers further go on to note that the DOJ is completely ignoring Mashinsky’s past, which includes starting many successful businesses as well as serving for the Israeli army. “There is no acknowledgment of the injuries and losses he suffered as a member of the Israeli Defense Forces. There is not even a passing nod to the businesses he founded over thirty years in heavily regulated environments that brought him success well before Celsius, with nary a blemish on his record. The government would have the Court believe that Alex was born at 59 years old, a fiend. Ignoring his background is unsurprising; it renders all the more absurd the notion that a man dedicated to service throughout his life suddenly underwent a Jekyll-to-Hyde transformation.” Mashinsky was arrested in July 2023 after being charged with violating securities law by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In December 2024, he pleaded guilty to perpetrating a multi-billion-dollar crypto fraud and other market manipulation schemes. At the time, the DOJ said Mashinsky falsely represented Celsius as a safe and secure platform as well as exaggerated its potential for profitability, greatly inflating its user base.

44292173,https://timestabloid.com/?p=66538,1746647760,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Here’s How Shiba Inu (SHIB) Could Turn $1,000 Investment to $10k, $50k, or $100k",https://timestabloid.com/heres-how-shiba-inu-shib-could-turn-1000-investment-to-10k-50k-or-100k/,"Shiba Inu remains a focus for speculative investors hoping to capitalize on long-term price appreciation. With the recent market correction, some see this as an opportunity to acquire the token at lower prices, potentially positioning for substantial returns in the future. At the time of writing, SHIB trades at $0.00001281, reflecting a 2.17% increase over the past 24 hours and a 3.14% decline over the past week. This dip coincided with a broader downturn in the cryptocurrency market, which has been influenced by uncertainty surrounding the U.S. Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision. As a result, the total crypto market capitalization fell by 0.73% to approximately $2.93 trillion. Despite the pullback, investor interest in SHIB remains active. Some market participants are considering investments of around $1,000, anticipating that such an entry could yield significant future returns if the token achieves certain price milestones. Projected SHIB Price Levels for Major Returns A $1,000 investment made when SHIB reached a daily high of $0.00001373 on May 1 would have secured roughly 83 million tokens. However, the current price allows investors to acquire approximately 79.49 million SHIB tokens for the same amount. For this portfolio to grow to $10,000, Shiba Inu would need to reach a price of $0.0001258, an increase of roughly 900%. If the price climbs further to $0.000629, the same holding would be worth about $50,000, representing a 4,900% gain. To achieve a $100,000 portfolio value, SHIB would have to rise to $0.001258, reflecting an approximate increase of 9,900% from its current price. Assuming the token’s circulating supply remains constant, these price levels would significantly raise Shiba Inu’s market capitalization. At $0.0001281, the market cap would be approximately $74.12 billion. At $0.000629 and $0.001281, the capitalization would increase to $370.63 billion and $741.27 billion, respectively.

According to analysts at Changelly , the $0.0001258 price level may be attainable by February 2030. Their forecasts suggest that the $0.000629 target could be reached by mid-2034, specifically around July. As for the highest projection of $0.001258, which implies SHIB would remove two zeros from its current price, analysts estimate this could be achieved between 2035 and 2039. It is important to note that these are speculative forecasts based on market trends and sentiment, not guarantees. Crypto expert Eunice Wong previously stated that SHIB might experience a breakout during the next major bull cycle, possibly reaching early targets such as $0.000125. However, all projections should be treated cautiously, given the high volatility and unpredictability of the cryptocurrency sector. Investors are advised to conduct thorough research and understand the risks involved in speculative investments like Shiba Inu. While the upside potential may be appealing, the path to such returns is neither quick nor certain. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

According to the onchain detective, the $45 million figure represents the latest financial losses in a string of social engineering scams targeting Coinbase users, which ZackXBT said is a problem unique among crypto exchanges: ""Over the past few months, I have reported on nine figures stolen from Coinbase users via similar social engineering scams. Interestingly, no other major exchange has the same problem."" Cointelegraph reached out to Coinbase but was unable to get a response by the time of publication. Source: ZachXBT The claims made by ZackXBT place the total amount lost by Coinbase users to social engineering scams at $330 million annually and reflect the growing number of sophisticated attack strategies employed by threat actors to defraud crypto holders. Related: $330M Bitcoin social engineering theft victim is elderly US citizen FBI issues warnings on social engineering scams targeting crypto users In July 2024, reports emerged that several Coinbase users were targeted by scammers posing as the exchange's support staff. The scammers managed to drain $1.7 million from one user. The United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issued a warning in August 2024, sounding the alarm on scammers posing as crypto exchanges in an attempt to steal user funds and sensitive user data. The FBI expanded this warning in September 2024, highlighting the use of fake employment offers from scammers targeting crypto users. According to the FBI, North Korean state-affiliated hacking groups would direct victims to download malicious software by disguising the software packages as employment tests, job applications, and information on investment opportunities. More recently, in March 2025, crypto users reported an uptick in scam emails imitating legitimate communication from crypto exchanges, directing users to withdraw their funds to external wallets. The growing variety and sophistication of social engineering scams prompted Coinbase chief security officer Phillip Martin to call for streamlining the scam reporting process by having a single, unified framework or repository for identifying and combating scams.

But while Ripple is building in the payment space, another revolutionary project Ruvi AI is making waves by combining AI with blockchain. Ruvi AI – Blockchain + AI Ruvi AI is not just a tech buzzword – it’s a vision for the future. By combining AI with blockchain Ruvi AI offers solutions that are both advanced and practical. The platform is designed to solve challenges across multiple industries from healthcare workflows to supply chain to predictive analytics in finance. Unlike traditional systems Ruvi AI uses blockchain’s transparency and security to create a foundation where AI applications can flourish without compromising data integrity. This allows businesses to unlock valuable insights while keeping their data secure and tamper proof. Ruvi AI is lowering the barriers to entry for advanced technology so all businesses can benefit from this technology. Phenomenal Presale Launch Ruvi AI has got both investor and community attention through its presale performance. Within a few days of launching Phase 1 of the presale the project has sold over 10 million tokens and raised over $100,000. This is a huge success. Tokens are available at $0.01 during Phase 1. But this won’t last long. Once Phase 2 kicks off the token price will increase 50% to $0.015. This will be followed by the beta platform launch which will happen immediately after the presale. By delivering on its roadmap Ruvi AI has proven itself to be an initiative that values transparency and investor commitment. VIP Tiers for Maximum Returns For those who want to maximize their returns Ruvi AI offers VIP tiers with exclusive benefits for early supporters. Two tiers stand out – VIP Tier 3 and VIP Tier 5. VIP Tier 3 To join VIP Tier 3 you need to invest $1,000 and get 100,000 tokens. This tier also comes with 60% bonus so total allocation is 160,000 tokens. At $0.07 listing price this is $11,200. If Ruvi AI hits $1 this would be $160,000. For moderate investors Tier 3 is a no brainer. VIP Tier 5 For bigger investors the perks of VIP Tier 5 are unmatched. With a $5,000 investment you get 500,000 tokens and 100% bonus. This is 1,000,000 tokens. At $0.07 listing price this is $70,000 and at $1 this would be $1,000,000. This tier shows Ruvi AI is serious about rewarding its biggest supporters. Leaderboard Rewards Ruvi AI also has a diverse and inclusive leaderboard reward system to incentivize contributions during the presale phase. Here’s how the rewards look: Top 10 contributors get 500,000 tokens each, which is $35,000 at listing price and $500,000 at $1. Top 50 contributors get 250,000 tokens, which is $17,500 at $0.07 and $250,000 at $1. Top 100 contributors get 100,000 tokens, which is $7,000 at $0.07 and $100,000 at $1. Top 200 contributors get 75,000 tokens, which is $5,250 at $0.07 and $75,000 at $1. Top 500 contributors get 40,000 tokens, which is $2,800 at $0.07 and $40,000 at $1. Top 1000 contributors get 20,000 tokens, which is $1,400 at $0.07 and $20,000 at $1. This is a great way to engage the community and provide value to all participants.

Its unique combination of these two technologies means Ruvi AI is set to lead the next digital wave. With presale success, investor focused VIP tiers and leaderboard rewards Ruvi AI is an opportunity for tech enthusiasts, businesses and investors.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently navigating its fourth presale phase, having raised $7.6 million and sold 443 million tokens to over 9,500 holders. Priced at $0.025, the project promises a 140% return at its $0.06 exchange listing. This shift from meme-driven speculation to a utility-focused platform signals a new chapter for investors seeking substantial gains in 2025’s crypto market. Pepe Coin (PEPE)’s Fleeting Glory Pepe Coin (PEPE) captivated the crypto market with its explosive growth, driven by viral community hype. Its value, however, remains tethered to speculative sentiment, lacking tangible utility. Investors who missed its peak now face a volatile token prone to sharp declines when market leaders like Bitcoin falter. This instability has pushed many to seek projects with stronger foundations. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) emerges as a beacon for these enthusiasts, offering a structured alternative that prioritizes long-term value over fleeting trends. Its presale success underscores a growing preference for practical financial solutions. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s Presale Surge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is accelerating through its fourth presale phase, now 57% filled, with tokens priced at $0.025. Investors purchasing now will see a 20% gain when phase five begins at $0.03. The project’s tokenomics ensure a 140% return at the $0.06 listing, with projections suggesting a climb to $2.50 in 2025, yielding a 9,900% return on investment. Over $7.6 million raised and 9,500 holders reflect robust demand. The opening phase sold out swiftly, signaling urgency for investors to act before phase five’s price hike narrows profit margins. Innovative Lending Fuels Demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is carving a niche with its dual-lending model, blending peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer systems. Lenders deposit assets into liquidity pools, earning interest, while borrowers secure loans with overcollateralized assets, ensuring stability. The platform’s mtTokens, representing deposits, accrue interest over time, offering passive income. A buy-and-distribute mechanism funnels platform revenue into repurchasing MUTM tokens, redistributing them to stakers, and sustaining price growth. Recently, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) launched a dashboard showcasing the top 50 token holders, rewarding them with bonus tokens for maintaining their positions, further incentivizing loyalty. Security and Transparency in Focus Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is prioritizing trust by undergoing a Certik audit of its smart contracts. The team plans to announce the results across social platforms, bolstering investor confidence. This commitment to security aligns with the project’s transparent roadmap, which includes a beta platform launch alongside its exchange debut. Unlike speculative tokens, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s focus on real-world utility through lending and passive income positions it as a stable contender in the crypto market. Investors are drawn to this clarity, especially as phase four’s window for entry at $0.025 rapidly closes. A New Path for Missed Opportunities Pepe Coin (PEPE) enthusiasts who missed its 2023 rally are finding redemption in Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The project’s presale, now in its fourth phase, offers a rare chance to secure tokens at a low entry point before the $0.03 phase five price. With $7.6 million raised and a 140% return locked in at launch, plus a projected $2.50 valuation in 2025, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is redefining high-yield opportunities. Investors eager to avoid past oversights are joining the 9,500 holders already onboard. Visit Mutuum Finance’s official site to explore this DeFi project before phase four sells out.

Beginners are not just collecting coins. They are learning how things work and seeing their progress. And since the $0.0019 price stays locked until May 13, there’s still time to join and share before the presale ends and listings begin.

The Kobeissi Letter’s official account on the social media platform X notes that heading into this year, gold had been underperforming the S&P 500 by approximately 10% since 2020. “However, as uncertainty has risen, GLD is now up +109% since 2020 compared to +74% in the S&P 500. But, why are gold prices surging even as the market recovers? Uncertainty remains the answer.” Source: KobeissiLetter/X The analysts also note that gold funds witnessed approximately $8 billion in net inflows three weeks ago, a record-setting total they say suggests “a continued flight to safety.” “As a result, the four-week moving average of inflows jumped to ~$4 billion, also an all-time high. This is likely the strongest gold market of all time.” Source: KobeissiLetter/X They also say central bank buying remains “historically strong.” The newsletter notes that f oreign holdings of Treasuries as a percentage of US government debt have fallen to approximately 23%, the lowest in more than two decades. The analysts, citing data from macro strategist Otavio Costa, also note that gold holdings as a percentage of global reserves have surged to approximately 18%, the highest in 26 years. Source: KobeissiLetter/X The Kobeissi Letter also points out that the US Dollar Index (DXY) recently plunged to a 52-week low. The DXY measures the strength of the USD against a basket of other major foreign currencies. “The US Dollar, DXY, has weakened by nearly 10% since the trade war began. A weaker dollar makes USD-denominated gold cheaper for foreign investors.

On-chain data and technical analysis suggest $93,000-$95,000 is a critical price range. Bitcoin ETFs are seeing increased inflows, particularly BlackRock's IBIT, signaling potential bullish movement. Crypto regulation remains complex, with some states like New Hampshire moving forward while others stall. By Zain Vawda Bitcoin prices ( BTC-USD ) have been consolidating since April 25 just below the 95000 mark with a brief foray higher being met by selling pressure. The world's largest cryptocurrency continues to defy market dynamics as it now accounts for around 65% of the entire crypto market cap, the highest level since 2021. Bitcoin has enjoyed a rollercoaster ride over the past four months which largely mirrors the overall market dynamic. As usual the naysayers were once again in full voice as price dipped toward the 75000 mark in early April after markets dealt with the shock of US President Donald Trump's universal tariff announcement. Since then however, Bitcoin has risen to a high of around 97900 a gain of around 30% from the early April lows. This at a time when risk assets have struggled and safe haven assets saw significant inflows. Is this another sign that markets are starting to see the world's largest crypto as a safe haven or diversification hedge against uncertainty? I believe it is, but many may disagree. Looking ahead though and there are differing takes on where Bitcoin may be headed. I have been looking through some data from GlassNode and there are some interesting takeaways that paint an interesting picture. Let us break these down below. Glassnode on-chain analytics According to Glassnode, the current price range between 93000 and 95000 where price found support multiple times between November 2024 and February 2025 may hold the key. To understand the current market momentum, we can look at how it reacts to key technical and on-chain indicators. When these two align, they give a stronger, clearer signal. For this analysis, we’re focusing on the 111DMA, a commonly used technical average for measuring Bitcoin momentum, and the Short-Term Holder cost basis, a pricing level that often separates bullish and bearish market trends. 111DMA is at $91.3K, and the Short-Term Holder cost basis is at $93.2K. The price recently moved above both levels and is now trying to stay within this range. This shows a solid upward trend. However, these levels need to be broken and maintained to see further price growth. If the price falls below this zone, it could turn bearish again, leaving investors with significant unrealized losses.

However, in order for the bulls to take charge a break and consolidation above the 95000 handle will likely be needed. ETF inflows return Bitcoin ETFs are enjoying a renaissance of late with BlackRock ishares Bitcoin trust delivering inflows on Friday, May 2 of $674.91 million. No other Bitcoin ETF saw inflows on Friday However, ETF flows have been strong since mid-April. The last 3 days however have seen flows of around $1.52 billion, a sign that a bullish breakout may be incoming? Source: Farside Investors Source: Farside Investors Another positive for ETF flows around Bitcoin comes from BlackRock once more. BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has brought in more money this year than the biggest gold-backed ETF. On May 6, Bloomberg’s Senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas shared that IBIT is now the sixth-highest fund in the US based on year-to-date inflows. The data shows that IBIT has attracted over $6.9 billion since January, beating SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), which brought in about $6.5 billion despite a 23% rise in returns. Is regulation still coming? Crypto regulation in the US has been a major talking point in 2025. There had been hopes that regulation would finally get the clarity many had been hoping for. So far, there has been a lot of movement at the SEC and on the regulatory front but it appears that every step forward is followed by two steps back. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan worries Congress might mess up key crypto regulations at the last moment. The GENIUS Act, once a bipartisan stablecoin win, lost critical support due to concerns about Trump’s role in crypto. This could stall other crypto bills too. Still, Hougan believes crypto can hit new highs, with bitcoin possibly soaring past $200K, if Congress passes stablecoin and market structure bills. ""The next weeks are critical,"" he said. ""Legislation failure could mean a tough summer for crypto, but success could spark an unstoppable bull run."" A positive announcement did materialize today however, with New Hampshire becoming the first U.S. state to approve a ""Strategic Bitcoin Reserve"" bill, allowing its treasury to invest in digital assets. Other states, like Arizona, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, and Texas, are considering similar laws inspired by a plan from a pro-Bitcoin nonprofit. On the other hand, Florida has put its bills, House Bill 487 and Senate Bill 550, on hold, stopping plans to allow certain public funds to invest in bitcoin. All in all a mixed bag and sentiment at present one could say. There does appear to be more optimism than pessimism at this point, so one can only hope that crypto regulation arrives in time and provides a summer crypto boost that many enthusiasts are hoping for. Technical Analysis - BTC/USD Bitcoin (BTC/USD) from a technical standpoint has found support at the 93000 handle which has held firm since April 25. Today's daily candle is on course for a close above the 95000 key level and may close as a hammer candlestick. This could set the stage for further gains, although it is important to remember that the previous foray above this level was met with significant selling pressure at 97000. The next area of resistance rests at the recent high at 97900 before the 100000 level comes into focus. As long as the 93000 handle holds the bulls will remain interested. If the 93000 handle makes way then support may be found at 91804 and the psychological 90000 handle.

According to the company’s analysis, BTC has signaled a strong rally again by easily breaking through the resistance level at $95,900. All eyes are now on the next major resistance area at $98,600. MakroVision described Bitcoin’s recovery from around $75,000 as “impressive.” In particular, the breakdown of the red downtrend line stood out as the technical development that ignited the fuse of the current rise. In the analysis, it was noted that the $98,600 level was an important liquidity area, and that if this level was exceeded, BTC could head towards higher target areas such as $102,000 and $106,400.

In case of a possible decline below this level, the support area around $87,500 continues to maintain its importance. At the end of the analysis, MakroVision stated that Bitcoin is moving towards the next resistance level, while drawing investors' attention to the question: “Will BTC be able to achieve the next breakout or is a new correction wave coming?” *This is not investment advice.
