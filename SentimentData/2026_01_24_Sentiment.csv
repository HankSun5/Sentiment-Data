Coinbase has recently pulled its backing for the CLARITY Act, a proposed framework designed to give U.S. regulators clearer authority over the digital asset sector. As a result, the U.S. Senate Banking Committee has delayed consideration of the bill by several weeks. Even so, broad-based crypto regulation in the U.S. appears unavoidable before year-end. At the same time, Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market has been declining since summer , often interpreted as an early signal that capital is rotating into altcoins such as XRP, Dogecoin, and Pepe ahead of the next major market upswing. XRP (XRP): Payments Blockchain Eyes $5 as Momentum Builds XRP ($XRP) , with a market capitalization of roughly $115 billion, remains the most established crypto in global payments, known for its rapid settlement speeds and low transaction fees. The XRP Ledger (XRPL) was engineered specifically for banks and financial institutions, positioning itself as a modern alternative to slower and costlier legacy networks like SWIFT. Ripple’s growing influence has attracted recognition from high-profile entities, including the UN Capital Development Fund and even the White House, reinforcing XRP’s reputation as a potentially transformative global payments solution. After concluding its long-running legal dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, XRP rallied to a new all-time high of $3.65 in mid-2025. Since then, broader market softness has triggered a pullback of around 48%, leaving the token trading near $1.89. Despite this correction, XRP’s stay below $2 may be short-lived. One of the most significant recent developments has been the approval of spot XRP ETFs in the U.S., opening the door to regulated exposure for both institutional and retail investors. Further ETF launches and improved regulatory clarity could push XRP toward the $5 level by Q2. Dogecoin (DOGE): Will the Doge Army Ever See $1 DOGE? Launched in 2013, Dogecoin ($DOGE) is the first and biggest meme coin, supported by one of the most loyal communities in crypto. What started as a parody now commands a market capitalization of approximately $20.7 billion. DOGE’s explosive rise during the 2021 bull market, fueled by high-profile endorsements from figures like Elon Musk, Snoop Dogg, and Gene Simmons, cemented its place in internet and pop culture history. While its origins are lighthearted, Dogecoin’s scale and liquidity help reduce the extreme volatility seen in smaller meme tokens. As a result, DOGE often trades more in line with major assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP. The slogan “Dogecoin to $1” remains a rallying cry among supporters, but reaching that milestone by 2026 could be difficult without meaningful progress on U.S. crypto regulation. Favorable market conditions could lift DOGE from around $0.14 today to roughly $0.50 by spring. That scenario would place it within striking distance of its 2021 all-time high of $0.7316 during a subsequent bull run. Adoption is also gradually expanding. Tesla accepts DOGE for select merchandise, while payment platforms like PayPal and Revolut now support Dogecoin transactions. Pepe (PEPE): The Iconic Webcomic Became One of Crypto’s Most Copied Coins Since its debut in April 2023, Pepe ($PEPE) has risen rapidly to become the third-largest meme coin, driven by the enduring viral appeal of Matt Furie’s Pepe the Frog character. With a market value near $2.1 billion, PEPE stands as the largest meme coin without a Shiba Inu-themed mascot. Speculation intensified after Elon Musk briefly used a Pepe image as his profile picture on X, sparking debate over his potential investment in the token. PEPE is currently trading around $0.000004914, up 25% over the past month. Despite this rebound, the token remains about 81% below its late-2024 high of $0.00002803, following a subdued summer and a lackluster close to 2025. Its relative strength index is at 44, indicating neutral after some recent panic selling. However, if the bull market hits in Q1, Pepe could easily rise to recapture its previous ATH by the end of the quarter. PEPE surged 69% recently, between December 30 and January 6, highlighting its classic meme-coin behavior, magnifying broader market swings in both directions. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): Meme Branding Meets Advanced Bitcoin Layer 2 Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a new Bitcoin Layer-2 initiative aimed at speeding up transactions, reducing fees, and unlocking advanced smart contract capabilities on the Bitcoin network. Built on the Solana Virtual Machine, Bitcoin Hyper integrates decentralized governance and a Canonical Bridge that enables smooth cross-chain Bitcoin transfers. The project’s presale has already secured more than $30.9 million, with some analysts speculating on potential returns of 10x to 100x once the token lists on exchanges. A recent Coinsult audit found no critical issues within the smart contract. The HYPER token powers the ecosystem, functioning as the unit for transaction fees, governance voting, and staking rewards. Early participants can stake tokens during the presale for yields of up to 38% APY, though rewards decline gradually as more users join. With exchange listings expected later this year, Bitcoin Hyper’s presale offers early exposure to what supporters see as the next phase of Bitcoin’s evolution.

This occurred when hackers reportedly got access to sensitive user information and tried to blackmail the company. The event has brought up new issues regarding the exposure of personal data in the crypto industry, as target fraud and physical attacks against holders are becoming more and more frequent in France. Authorities Link Waltio Breach to Shiny Hunters’ Extortion Attempt In a statement released this week, French cybersecurity institutions confirmed that, via its cybercrime division, the Paris Public Prosecutor’s Office had issued an order to the National Cyber Unit of the Gendarmerie to establish the extent of the breach and identify exposed users. Source: Paris Public Prosecutor’s Office Officials advised that users whose information might have been stolen should be wary of scammers who claim to be genuine service providers or other officials and force them to give up their digital assets using the stolen information. The law enforcement agencies reported that some more recent fraudsters posed as crypto businesses, bank anti-fraud units, or even law enforcement officers and magistrates. French newspaper Le Parisien stated that the attack at Waltio was associated with a ransom demand by a hacking organization called Shiny Hunters. The group purportedly had obtained personal information of approximately 50,000 Waltio users, most of whom reside in France, and said it had samples of the stolen information as proof. Waltio later filed a complaint of attempted extortion and unauthorized access to the automated data system. Waltio said its initial internal assessment showed that the attackers accessed tax reports for the 2024 period. These documents included users’ email addresses, information on crypto profits or losses, and asset balances at the end of the year. The company stated that banking details, administrative records, and tax identification data were not affected and that its core infrastructure was not compromised. Waltio added that its services remain operational and that client funds are not at risk. France Tightens Oversight After Crypto Data Breach Amid Rise in Kidnapping Cases Waltio was founded in France and is headquartered in Clermont-Ferrand. It serves roughly 150,000 users and focuses on simplifying crypto tax compliance for European investors, particularly in France, Spain, and Belgium. The platform aggregates transaction data from more than 700 exchanges, wallets, and blockchains to calculate capital gains, losses, and staking income, and generates tax-compliant reports for local filings. The investigation comes amid heightened scrutiny of crypto-related data leaks in France. In the last year, police have attributed a number of home invasions, kidnappings, and attempted kidnappings to the criminals who intended to use the knowledge of the victims having digital assets. Although the leakage of data has not been directly linked to these crimes , the investigation teams have not eliminated the chances of the data being used to establish potential targets. Masked gunmen steal crypto USB in France as prosecutors reveal tax official sold government database access identifying crypto investors to criminal gangs for 800 euros per operation. #Crypto #Attack #France https://t.co/GmfOkwsE6E — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 9, 2026 Fraud victims have been cautioned to keep evidence, report to the police, and address the data protection authority in France in instances where they feel that their personal data has not been sufficiently safeguarded. The Waltio incident is not the first case of data exposure in the crypto industry in the past. Hardware wallet manufacturer Ledger announced earlier this month that a breach of a third-party payment processor, Global-e, took place, exposing the data of its customers. Last month, crypto tax software developer Koinly also notified users of a potential email data breach related to the use of a third-party analytics platform.

After soaring over 80% in 2025 on turnaround optimism, shares tumbled up to ~17% , when its first‑quarter outlook came in below Wall Street expectations. Management forecasted Q1 revenue around $12.2B, short of the anticipated $12.6B, and guided to breakeven earnings — a stark reminder that execution still lags behind market narratives. This miss occurred even though Intel reported $13.7B in Q4 revenue and $0.15 in non‑GAAP EPS, both beating consensus. Government Positioning and Strategic Stakes Intel’s comeback story isn’t just about chips. The company is a major beneficiary of the CHIPS Act and related federal incentives, positioning the U.S. government as one of its largest shareholders. Recent market moves triggered a multi‑billion‑dollar paper loss for the government after the sell‑off, though its overall position remains profitable with significant gains since its original investment. This intertwines Intel’s fate with geopolitical industrial policy and heightens scrutiny over performance. Whale Activity & Sentiment Signals Large options flows have also begun shaping sentiment. Signals from CheddarFlow reveal a roughly $500M options position on $INTC, interpreted by traders as institutional speculation on a major move in either direction. Such “whale” activity often presages volatility and underscores that heavy hitters see Intel as a strategic play, not just a turnaround narrative. Combined with social commentary from market observers, this activity suggests significant positioning ahead of catalysts like supply improvements or policy shifts. (Insert actual tweet embed here.) Near‑term pain largely stems from supply constraints — executives warn that available supply will hit seasonal lows before climbing later in 2026. These constraints, especially in server CPU and AI data‑center chips, are occurring even as demand accelerates, denting revenue potential and feeding concerns over market share erosion to competitors like AMD and Nvidia. Price Levels to Watch in 2026 Bearish Break: Closing below $44 could trigger a slide to $38–$40 on technical weakness and sentiment pressure. Consolidation Range: $44-$50 if supply improves and execution narratives stabilize. Bullish Rebound: Clearing $50 with strong yield data and major foundry wins, potentially from cloud or AI OEM contracts could reignite upside. Analysts’ bull scenarios have even priced $INTC higher if foundry adoption accelerates beyond expectations. Intel’s near‑term stock forecast blends policy tailwinds, execution risk, and speculative positioning, making it one of the more volatile and story‑rich semiconductor equities in 2026.",News|Reports,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-23 22:47:40

If that happens, altcoins like XRP and Ethereum could explode. Bitcoin is currently trading around $88,000 after getting rejected near the $98,000 level for the second time. Fundamentally, nothing has gone wrong. Bitcoin, XRP, and ETH continue to improve over time. Technically, though, these coins are still in a weak phase. Below is how things could play out for the three as we head into 2026. Bitcoin (BTC) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Bitcoin Price Prediction: What If BTC Just Broke Out? BTC is starting to tighten up inside a squeezing structure, with rising support pushing price into a descending resistance line. It is basically a classic compression setup. The main level to watch is the $96,000–$98,000 resistance zone, which has shut down every bounce so far. A daily close above that area would be a big deal and could open the door for a move toward $102,000, then $105,000. On the downside, rising support from the recent lows in the low $80,000s has held up well, keeping higher lows intact and stopping a deeper breakdown. Momentum is neutral but slowly improving. For now, Bitcoin is stuck in consolidation after the recent drop, and this is a patience game. Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH Holds Support but Lacks Conviction Ethereum spot ETFs continue to record outflows. However, the recent outflows are low compared to past days’ outflows, which is a good sign. ETH spot ETFs recorded $42 million in outflows ETH price is trying to hold its structure after a rough pullback, with price riding along rising support but struggling to break through the $3,400–$3,500 resistance zone. That area has rejected price multiple times, which is why ETH keeps stalling instead of trending higher. As long as the rising support around the high $2,600s to $2,700 zone holds, the bigger structure stays constructive, and this move looks more like consolidation than a full breakdown. A clean break above $3,500 would be the first real sign of strength and could open the door for a push toward $4,300, with $5,000 as the larger upside target. Momentum is still weak but starting to stabilize. RSI needs to push back above 50 to support a stronger bullish move. XRP Price Prediction: XRP Tries to Escape the Downtrend, Is $2.50 Next? XRP is still stuck inside a well-defined descending channel, which explains why rallies keep getting sold into instead of turning into real trend reversals. Price recently bounced from the $1.80 area, which is acting as a key demand zone and the main bullish invalidation level. As long as XRP holds above that level, this bounce remains technically valid, but the structure is still weak overall. The first real test for buyers sits around the $2.40–$2.50 zone, where the price previously broke down and where the upper channel resistance lines up. A clean break and daily hold above that area would be the first sign that momentum is shifting, opening the door for a move toward the $3.00 target zone. Momentum is still mixed. RSI is sitting around 42. Notice something? All three are sitting at the same point waiting for the major move. Holding above $1.80 keeps the bullish scenario alive, while a break below that level would invalidate the setup and likely send XRP back toward lower support Bitcoin Hyper Is Loading While the Market Sleeps With Bitcoin compressing under $100,000, Ethereum stuck below major resistance, and XRP still fighting its downtrend, the market is clearly in a waiting phase. That is usually when attention quietly shifts to projects that do not need a confirmed breakout to start moving. That is where Bitcoin Hyper is starting to stand out. Bitcoin Hyper is being positioned as a high-beta play built specifically for volatility cycles like the one CZ is hinting at. When Bitcoin enters a supercycle, capital does not just flow into majors. It spills into smaller, faster-moving narratives that offer asymmetric upside, especially while the big names are still consolidating. The project has already raised over $ 30.9M , showing strong early conviction even while the broader market remains cautious. On top of that, Bitcoin Hyper offers staking rewards around 39% APY, giving holders an incentive to stay locked in instead of trading short-term noise. Historically, the biggest winners of new cycles are rarely the assets that break out last. They are the ones accumulated quietly while Bitcoin ranges, Ethereum chops, and XRP frustrate traders. Bitcoin Hyper is clearly targeting that window. If Bitcoin really does enter a supercycle in 2026, the projects built and accumulated during this compression phase are often the ones that move first and hardest once momentum returns. Bitcoin Hyper is shaping up to be one of those names traders keep an eye on.

JUST IN: Ripple has renewed its custody partnership with Garanti BBVA Crypto, strengthening institutional access to XRP and expanding its footprint in Turkey. pic.twitter.com/GZcqPPev8m — Crypto Briefing (@Crypto_Briefing) January 23, 2026 The collaboration ensures that Garanti BBVA’s retail customers maintain access to secure custody and transfer services for multiple cryptocurrencies, including XRP , Bitcoin , and Ethereum . Garanti BBVA’s cryptocurrency journey began in late 2024 following a successful pilot program conducted with both Ripple and IBM . The initial phase attracted approximately 14,000 early adopters. This partnership was specifically designed to provide the bank with enterprise-grade key management infrastructure, enabling secure deployment and management of digital asset services. Beyond the Turkish partnership, Ripple has secured another important regulatory milestone. The company recently obtained a “Green Light Letter” from Luxembourg’s Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF), representing preliminary approval for an Electronic Money Institution (EMI) license. While the regulator has completed its legal assessment, final authorization remains pending. This development adds to Ripple’s extensive regulatory portfolio, which now includes over 75 licenses across global jurisdictions. XRP Price Prediction: XRP Forms Rare W-Pattern at $1.95 Support The 4-hour XRP/USDT chart reveals several compelling technical patterns. Price action has been consolidating within a falling wedge formation, a pattern that frequently precedes bullish breakouts rather than continued downtrends. The narrowing range between lower highs and lower lows suggests diminishing selling pressure as the asset approaches a critical decision point. A notable W-pattern has formed near the wedge’s lower boundary, with the $1.88–$1.90 zone demonstrating robust support. Source: TradingView/ Suryapro This repeated defense of key levels indicates strong buying interest at these prices, establishing a potential launching pad for upward movement. Currently trading around $1.95, XRP faces immediate resistance in the $1.98–$2.00 zone, which coincides with the wedge’s upper trendline. A decisive 4-hour close above this critical area would confirm both the falling wedge breakout and the W-pattern reversal signal. If XRP successfully breaks through the $2.00 psychological barrier, analysts anticipate initial upside targets between $2.10 and $2.20. Strong momentum could extend the rally toward the $2.35–$2.40 region , with some optimistic projections suggesting movement toward $2.50. However, traders should remain cautious of potential downside scenarios. A rejection at the $2.00 resistance level, followed by a breakdown below wedge support, could postpone the bullish thesis. Such a development might result in renewed consolidation or a retest of the lower $1.80 range. Beyond XRP: Bitcoin Hyper Raises $30M As First True BTC Layer 2 While XRP attracts attention for its potential breakout, investors are also watching Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a project creating the first authentic Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin using Solana-based technology. The platform combines speed and scalability while maintaining Bitcoin’s security framework. The Bitcoin Hyper presale has already raised over $30 million , demonstrating strong market interest. The project’s Solana-powered Layer 2 infrastructure enables developers to build Bitcoin-native decentralized applications, offering BTC holders new opportunities to utilize their assets through purpose-built on-chain tools. As major wallets and exchanges prepare to integrate this scaling solution, demand for $HYPER is expected to increase rapidly. The token is currently available during the presale phase at $0.013625 . Interested investors can visit the official Bitcoin Hyper website and connect their preferred wallet (such as Best Wallet) to swap USDT or SOL for $HYPER, or purchase directly using a bank card before the next price increase.

Analysts project a possible increase to $3,360. However, these are just small fluctuations for a large cryptocurrency and are encouraging traders to look for even bigger gains elsewhere. Traders are now picking Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the top crypto to buy in 2026. Although there is a steady improvement offered by Ethereum, the presale offered by MUTM is a rare opportunity for significant growth from the very beginning. The low cost associated with it, along with its strong platform, make it the next big opportunity. Ethereum’s Growth Trend Ethereum is a leader in smart contracts and the decentralized finance space, and as such, the price actions have a great effect on the overall market. It did drop down close to $3,170, but it was able to bounce back at around $3,205. Analysts are keeping tabs on whether it could move past the resistance level of $3,360. This is even if it does so, since the percentage increase is not that great for a newcomer. For investors looking for transformative levels of returns, the most attractive investment opportunities can be found in projects before the time of listing on large exchanges. Although the long-term potential of Ethereum is great, its size prevents it from easily achieving the kind of explosive growth associated with a new project such as Mutuum Finance during. Mutuum Finance Presale Advantage Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in the 7th presale phase, and the tokens are only priced at $0.04. This presale phase is filling up fast. Once completed, the presale will move to the 8th phase, priced at $0.045. This is almost a 20% increase. The launch price of the token will be $0.06. This will give stage 7 buyers an instant profit enough to turn a small $500 into $750 before trading begins. However, the actual potential here is much more. With its lending system going into operation, the demand for MUTM may escalate. Analysts who study its model indicate a price range of $2 to $4 after listing on major exchanges. A present investment of $1,000 may potentially escalate to $50,000. Such a prospect makes MUTM one of the top cryptocurrencies for serious investors. Peer-to-Peer Lending for Direct Control Mutuum Finance offers a unique Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending system where users can enter into a lending agreement with each other. Users can choose to lend with an interest rate and a period in mind. For instance, lending 5,000 USDT with an annual interest rate of 12% could result in a passive income of 600 USDT per annum. Another notable aspect is the development of a stablecoin that is pegged to the value of the US dollar. It is created when the user locks in collateral of a higher value in the form of ETH. For example, when a user locks in collateral worth $10,000 in ETH, he/she can create stablecoins worth $7,500. It can then be lent to other people to earn interest in the form of 10% per year. Such a useful ecosystem is a direct demand creator for the MUTM token. Why MUTM is the Clear Growth Opportunity Ethereum seems to have a bright future as an integral part of the DeFi crypto environment. Yet, to ensure exponential growth, new projects with innovative ideas are required. What makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) attractive is not only its affordably priced presale, but it also has an operational platform that provides real yields. This is the key underlying strength that makes analysts recommend MUTM for the year 2026. Do not let the chance to buy at $0.04 slip away. The next price rise is imminent, making it the best time to position yourself in what is considered the best DeFi crypto investment.

57422345,658815,1769209231,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57422345.jpeg,OpenSea Insider Trading Case Ends Without A Retrial – Details,https://bitcoinist.com/opensea-insider-trading-case-ends-without-a-retrial-details/,"Nathaniel Chastain, a former product manager at OpenSea, will not face a retrial after federal prosecutors chose to drop their re-review of his insider trading case. Reports say the US Attorney’s Office reached a deferred prosecution agreement with Chastain that will lead to dismissal of the charges once the agreement runs its course. What Prosecutors Decided Prosecutors told a Manhattan federal court they would not retry Chastain following an appeals court ruling that tossed his earlier conviction. Under the deferred prosecution deal, the government will dismiss the case about a month after notifying the court, and Chastain has agreed to forfeit roughly 15.98 ETH tied to the trades. He has already served three months in prison from his original sentence. How The Appeals Court Changed The Case According to the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, the jury in the first trial had been given the wrong instructions about what the wire fraud law covers. The judges said confidential information only counts as property under the statute when it has commercial value to the employer, and jurors might otherwise convict someone for behavior that is unethical but not criminal. That legal point is at the heart of the reversal. Reports note that prosecutors had called the matter the first-ever insider trading case tied to NFTs. Now, lower courts and enforcement teams will have to think carefully before using traditional fraud laws to police activity in NFT markets. The ruling highlights a gap between old statutes and new kinds of online goods, which may push lawmakers to give clearer rules for how to treat confidential business signals related to crypto platforms. OpenSea: The Case’s Earlier Chapters Chastain was first charged in mid-2022 after prosecutors said he bought certain NFTs before they were featured on OpenSea’s homepage, then sold them after prices rose. He was convicted at trial in 2023 of wire fraud and money laundering and received a sentence that included three months behind bars. The US Attorney’s Office originally described the scheme as a novel use of insider knowledge in digital markets. With the deferred prosecution agreement in place for OpenSea, prosecutors can close this chapter without a new trial. Chastain’s forfeiture of crypto assets and his already served time mean the government has secured some remedy, while the appellate decision leaves open big questions about when private business information can be treated as property for federal fraud charges. Legal teams, judges, and regulators are likely to keep a close eye on how similar cases are handled in the future.

After a brief pullback on January 20, XRP-linked exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have resumed accumulation, adding fresh fuel to bullish XRP price prediction . Data from SoSo Value shows that ETFs brought in $9 million in the past two days. As a result, XRP’s ETF assets stand at $1.37 billion, still surpassing Solana-linked ETF products as Wall Street’s appetite for the top altcoin persists. Ongoing accumulation seems to indicate that whales are aware of something that the rest of the market is ignoring. Is XRP getting ready to make an explosive move? XRP Price Prediction: Descending Triangle Breakout Could Finally Push XRP Above Its 200-Day EMA The price has bounced off the $1.90 support multiple times already, creating a strong floor from which XRP could start running higher. The last rally started after the token broke out of the descending triangle shown in the chart, but faced strong selling pressure at the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA). Source: TradingView A similar setup has formed now, anticipating a potential move from bulls over the next few days if the $1.90 level holds. If that happens, the odds of a bullish breakout above the 200-day EMA will rise. This translates into a short-term target of $2.50, followed by a much stronger move to $3.10 at least. As altcoins regain momentum and prepare for the next major rally, top crypto presales like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) are gaining serious traction. This high-potential project has already raised over $30 million, aiming to bring Solana’s fast speeds and low costs to the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Revamps BTC’s Use Cases by Leveraging Solana’s Power While BTC is a great store of value, it has always been slow and expensive to move – until now. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a crypto presale that brings Solana’s world-class speed to the Bitcoin blockchain. This new layer 2 solution solves the biggest problems Bitcoin has faced by reducing transaction fees to nearly zero and enabling instant asset transfers.

Through this L2, they will finally put their Bitcoin to work by lending, staking, and trading their assets without leaving the security of the Bitcoin network. The crypto community is already moving fast, with over $30 million raised to bring this vision to life. At the heart of this project is the $HYPER token . As adoption grows and more users tap into its fast, low-cost Layer 2 features, demand for $HYPER is expected to rise. If you want to get in early, you can still grab $HYPER at its presale price.

This announcement follows the company’s unprecedented accumulation of 214,400 BTC, valued at approximately $14 billion, establishing MicroStrategy as the world’s largest publicly traded corporate Bitcoin holder. Consequently, the conference represents a pivotal moment for institutional cryptocurrency adoption, potentially influencing how Fortune 500 companies approach digital asset integration. MicroStrategy Bitcoin Conference Details and Strategic Timing MicroStrategy will host its Bitcoin for Corporations 2026 event at a major Las Vegas convention center on February 24-25. The company confirmed this schedule through Michael Saylor’s official X platform announcement. This timing strategically precedes the April 2024 Bitcoin halving event, which historically triggers significant market cycles. Therefore, the conference positions itself at a crucial juncture for corporate financial planning. The event specifically targets corporate executives, treasury managers, and institutional investors. MicroStrategy designed the agenda to address practical implementation challenges. These challenges include accounting standards, regulatory compliance, and security protocols. The company’s extensive experience with Bitcoin acquisition provides real-world case studies for attendees. For instance, MicroStrategy’s quarterly earnings reports now prominently feature Bitcoin holdings as a core asset. Industry analysts immediately recognized the conference’s significance. Bloomberg Intelligence reported increased corporate inquiries about Bitcoin treasury strategies throughout 2024. Similarly, Fidelity Digital Assets noted a 300% year-over-year increase in institutional account openings. These trends suggest growing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrency as a legitimate asset class. Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Trends and Market Context Enterprise Bitcoin adoption has evolved significantly since MicroStrategy’s initial 2020 investment. Initially, companies treated cryptocurrency as a speculative alternative investment. However, the landscape has matured considerably. Today, corporations increasingly view Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset and inflation hedge. This shift reflects changing perceptions about digital currency’s long-term value proposition. Several major corporations have publicly disclosed Bitcoin holdings following MicroStrategy’s lead. Tesla, Square, and Marathon Digital Holdings all allocated portions of their treasuries to cryptocurrency. Additionally, traditional financial institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity have launched Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). These developments created a more robust infrastructure for corporate investment. Company Bitcoin Holdings Initial Investment Date MicroStrategy 214,400 BTC August 2020 Tesla 10,800 BTC February 2021 Block (Square) 8,027 BTC October 2020 Marathon Digital 13,726 BTC Various The regulatory environment continues to evolve alongside these corporate investments. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) implemented new cryptocurrency accounting rules in December 2023. These rules require companies to measure digital assets at fair value. Previously, companies had to report impairment losses regardless of price recovery. This accounting change removed a significant barrier to corporate adoption. Expert Analysis of Corporate Cryptocurrency Strategy Financial analysts emphasize the strategic importance of MicroStrategy’s conference initiative. According to CoinShares’ 2024 Digital Asset Fund Flows Report, institutional investors allocated $2.7 billion to cryptocurrency products in the first quarter alone. This represents a 40% increase compared to the same period in 2023. The data suggests accelerating institutional interest despite market volatility. Industry experts point to several key factors driving corporate Bitcoin adoption: Inflation hedging: Companies seek protection against currency devaluation Portfolio diversification: Bitcoin demonstrates low correlation with traditional assets Technological innovation: Blockchain technology offers potential efficiency gains Competitive positioning: Early adopters gain first-mover advantages in digital finance Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance research indicates that corporate treasury Bitcoin allocations typically range from 1% to 5% of total reserves. However, MicroStrategy’s aggressive approach exceeds these conventional parameters. The company’s Bitcoin holdings now represent over 150% of its market capitalization. This unconventional strategy has generated both admiration and skepticism within financial circles. Conference Agenda and Expected Impact on Enterprise Adoption The Bitcoin for Corporations 2026 conference will feature presentations from multiple industry sectors. Technology companies, financial institutions, and regulatory experts will share practical insights. MicroStrategy’s executive team will detail their operational experience with large-scale Bitcoin acquisition and storage. Furthermore, cybersecurity firms will demonstrate enterprise-grade custody solutions for digital assets. Conference organizers designed the program to address specific corporate concerns. Technical sessions will cover wallet security, transaction procedures, and tax implications. Strategic discussions will explore portfolio allocation models and risk management frameworks. Legal experts will provide updates on evolving regulatory requirements across different jurisdictions. The event’s location in Las Vegas carries symbolic significance. Nevada has emerged as a cryptocurrency-friendly jurisdiction with favorable regulatory policies. The state legislature passed multiple blockchain-related bills in recent sessions. This regulatory environment supports corporate cryptocurrency experimentation and innovation. Industry observers anticipate several potential outcomes from the conference. First, increased corporate Bitcoin adoption could follow as companies gain confidence from peer experiences. Second, standardized best practices might emerge for enterprise cryptocurrency management. Third, regulatory clarity could improve through dialogue between corporations and policymakers. Finally, new financial products and services could develop to meet institutional demand. Conclusion MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin for Corporations 2026 conference represents a strategic inflection point for enterprise cryptocurrency adoption. The event brings together corporate leaders, technologists, and regulators at a critical moment in Bitcoin’s evolution. Michael Saylor’s announcement signals growing institutional confidence in digital assets as legitimate treasury instruments. Consequently, this conference could accelerate mainstream corporate Bitcoin integration. The gathering in Las Vegas will likely produce valuable insights about cryptocurrency’s role in modern corporate finance. Ultimately, the event may establish new standards for how businesses approach digital asset strategy in an increasingly digital economy. FAQs Q1: What is the main purpose of MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin for Corporations conference? The conference aims to educate corporate executives about Bitcoin integration strategies, addressing practical implementation challenges including accounting, security, and regulatory compliance based on MicroStrategy’s extensive experience. Q2: Why is the timing of this conference significant for corporate Bitcoin adoption? The February 2026 timing follows the April 2024 Bitcoin halving event, positioning the conference during a potential market cycle that could influence corporate financial planning and treasury management decisions. Q3: How has corporate Bitcoin adoption evolved since MicroStrategy’s initial investment? Corporate adoption has shifted from speculative investment to treating Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset and inflation hedge, with improved accounting standards and more robust institutional infrastructure supporting this transition. Q4: What regulatory changes have made Bitcoin more attractive to corporations? The Financial Accounting Standards Board implemented new rules in December 2023 allowing companies to measure cryptocurrency at fair value rather than reporting impairment losses, removing a significant accounting barrier to adoption. Q5: What potential impacts could this conference have on broader enterprise cryptocurrency adoption? The conference could accelerate adoption by establishing best practices, improving regulatory clarity through corporate-policymaker dialogue, and developing new institutional-grade financial products and services for digital assets.

The interest in the president’s controversial cryptocurrency has diminished. Investors who bought at the highest prices face large losses due to the steep price drops, increasing criticism of the president’s crypto businesses. Trump’s inauguration hype turns into a 93.4% collapse The Trump coin went live on January 18, 2025. A year later, it’s trading at $4.84, down 93.4% from the highest point. The token dropped steeply after reaching its peak near the US president’s January 2025 inauguration. Before Trump’s January inauguration, the $TRUMP memecoin rose sharply from $1.20 to $73.43, per data from CoinGecko. In late 2023 and early 2024, investors showed intense excitement for memecoins . Anyone online can launch volatile crypto tokens. These tokens lack fundamental value, a business model, or cash flow. They depend on popularity and ties to viral events or famous people to attract speculative interest. A few days following the launch of the $TRUMP coin, Melania Trump introduced her own memecoin. According to aggregated data , the price soared to $13.05 but has since dropped to just under $0.15, a 99% decline from its highest point. The $MELANIA memecoin represents the classic pump and dump cycle of a memecoin. Even with its price drop, $TRUMP is still the sixth largest memecoin by market cap, per CoinGecko data. Official Trump (TRUMP) price chart. Source: CoinGecko . The Trumps made over $1 billion from crypto The Trumps made over $1 billion in pre-tax profits from crypto activities. “In the last couple of weeks alone, the Trump family added $1.3 BILLION to their wealth through their crypto schemes,” wrote the U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren on X. On-chain data shows TRUMP and MELANIA meme coins earned about $427 million from trading fees. The World Liberty Financial tokens (WLFI) made $550 million in profits. And the USD1 stablecoin had $2.7 billion in sales. Crypto experts, governance specialists, and Democrats have strongly condemned the president and his wife’s memecoins as a fast cash scheme and misuse of authority. After coming back to the White House, Trump supported the industry by naming pro-crypto regulators. The president granted pardons to high-profile crypto figures, including Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht, and former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao. Trump and his family started multiple crypto companies including World Liberty Financial, and American Bitcoin. Governance experts want new US crypto rules in Washington to have strict safeguards against government conflicts of interest. Last week, Democracy Defenders Action and the Project on Government Oversight asked the Senate to ban the president and top officials from owning or trading cryptocurrencies. They warned that those in power could exploit the system, putting everyday investors at risk of fraud, manipulation, and abuse. The Trump companies have moved their focus to new ventures. According to Cryptopolitan, Trump Media will airdrop a new crypto token to DJT shareholders on February 2. The token distribution event will take place on the Cronos blockchain.

This strategic consideration could fundamentally reshape how international investors access U.S. equity markets, merging traditional finance with blockchain technology. The move follows growing institutional interest in digital asset integration and reflects the evolving regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency platforms worldwide. Tokenized Stocks: A New Frontier for Cryptocurrency Exchanges The reported consideration by Binance and OKX represents a significant expansion beyond traditional cryptocurrency trading. Tokenized stocks are digital tokens on a blockchain that represent ownership in traditional securities, specifically mirroring the price movements of underlying stocks. Consequently, these tokens provide exposure to equity markets without requiring direct ownership of the actual shares. This innovation potentially removes geographical barriers and simplifies access for global investors who face regulatory or logistical hurdles when investing in U.S. markets. Currently, the tokenized stock market features established providers like Ondo Finance (ONDO) and Kraken’s xStocks. These platforms have demonstrated both market demand and technical feasibility. For instance, Ondo Finance has successfully tokenized U.S. Treasury bills and other real-world assets, creating a precedent for major exchanges. Similarly, Kraken’s offering through its xStocks platform shows existing infrastructure for compliant tokenized equity trading. Therefore, Binance and OKX entering this space could dramatically increase market liquidity and mainstream adoption. The Current Landscape of Digital Securities The tokenized asset market has evolved substantially since its inception. Initially, platforms focused on cryptocurrency and stablecoins before expanding into real-world assets (RWAs). Today, tokenization encompasses various asset classes including bonds, commodities, and real estate. The reported move by Binance and OKX specifically targets equity tokenization, which represents one of the largest untapped markets for blockchain technology. Major financial institutions like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton have also explored tokenized funds, signaling broader industry validation. Several key characteristics define tokenized stocks. First, they typically operate 24/7, unlike traditional stock markets with set trading hours. Second, they enable fractional ownership, allowing investors to purchase small portions of high-value stocks. Third, blockchain settlement can reduce transaction times from days to minutes. However, these benefits come with regulatory complexities, particularly regarding jurisdiction, investor protection, and compliance with securities laws. The exchanges must navigate these challenges carefully to ensure sustainable operations. Regulatory Considerations and Market Impact Any launch of tokenized stocks by major exchanges requires careful regulatory navigation. Different jurisdictions maintain varying rules regarding securities tokenization. For example, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) classifies most tokenized securities under existing securities laws. Conversely, some European and Asian markets have developed specific frameworks for digital assets. Binance and OKX would likely implement strict geographic restrictions and know-your-customer (KYC) protocols to comply with these diverse regulations. The potential market impact of this expansion is substantial. Tokenized stocks could attract new investor demographics to cryptocurrency platforms, particularly those interested in traditional equities but familiar with digital asset interfaces. Furthermore, increased competition might drive innovation in trading features, custody solutions, and yield-generating products. Market analysts suggest this move could accelerate the convergence of decentralized finance (DeFi) and traditional finance (TradFi), creating hybrid financial ecosystems. Technical Implementation and Security Protocols Implementing tokenized stocks requires robust technical infrastructure. Exchanges must ensure accurate price oracles that reliably reflect underlying stock values. They also need secure custody solutions for the reserve assets backing each token. Typically, licensed custodians hold the actual stocks while the tokens trade on blockchain networks. This structure maintains the legal ownership chain while enabling digital trading. Additionally, exchanges must implement anti-money laundering (AML) systems and transaction monitoring tools that meet global financial standards. Security remains paramount for tokenized assets. Blockchain networks offer transparency through public ledgers, but smart contract vulnerabilities present risks. Leading exchanges generally employ multiple security audits, insurance funds, and cold storage solutions for reserve assets. For instance, existing providers use regulated entities to hold underlying securities, ensuring legal compliance. Binance and OKX would likely adopt similar multi-layered security approaches, potentially setting new industry benchmarks for digital asset protection. Expert Perspectives on Market Evolution Financial technology experts highlight several implications of this potential expansion. First, tokenized stocks could enhance market efficiency by reducing intermediaries in settlement and custody. Second, they might increase global capital flow into U.S. markets by simplifying cross-border investment. Third, they create new product opportunities like automated dividend reinvestment or programmable investment strategies. However, experts also caution about regulatory fragmentation and the need for international coordination on digital asset standards. Historical context shows steady progression toward asset tokenization. The 2017-2018 initial coin offering (ICO) boom demonstrated demand for digital securities, albeit with regulatory issues. Subsequently, security token offerings (STOs) emerged with more compliance focus. Now, large exchanges exploring tokenized stocks indicate maturation toward institutional-grade products. This evolution suggests blockchain technology is gradually integrating with mainstream finance rather than replacing it, creating complementary systems that leverage the strengths of both traditional and digital infrastructure. Conclusion The reported consideration of tokenized stocks by Binance and OKX represents a significant milestone in financial market evolution. This potential expansion bridges cryptocurrency innovation with traditional equity markets, potentially democratizing global access to U.S. stocks. While regulatory and technical challenges remain, the existing success of platforms like Ondo Finance and Kraken’s xStocks provides a proven framework. As cryptocurrency exchanges continue diversifying their offerings, tokenized stocks could become a standard component of digital asset portfolios, further blurring the lines between traditional and decentralized finance. The development warrants close observation as it may signal broader transformation in how the world invests. FAQs Q1: What are tokenized stocks? Tokenized stocks are digital tokens on a blockchain that represent ownership or price exposure to traditional company stocks. Each token typically mirrors the value of a specific share, allowing trading on cryptocurrency platforms. Q2: How do tokenized stocks differ from traditional stocks? Unlike traditional stocks, tokenized versions often trade 24/7, enable fractional ownership, and settle transactions faster using blockchain technology. However, they may not confer voting rights or direct legal ownership of the underlying shares. Q3: Are tokenized stocks legal and regulated? Regulation varies by jurisdiction. In many markets, tokenized stocks qualify as securities and fall under existing financial regulations. Providers typically implement geographic restrictions and compliance measures to operate within legal frameworks. Q4: What risks are associated with tokenized stocks? Potential risks include regulatory changes, smart contract vulnerabilities, custody issues with underlying assets, and market liquidity constraints. Investors should research providers’ compliance, security measures, and reserve auditing practices. Q5: How would Binance and OKX offering tokenized stocks affect existing markets? Their entry could increase market liquidity, improve product innovation through competition, and accelerate mainstream adoption. It might also pressure traditional brokers to enhance digital offerings and could influence regulatory developments worldwide.

According to the market expert, XRP must reclaim the Ichimoku Base before it can resume its upside to new levels. XRP Price Recovery To Resume Above Ichimoku Base Market analyst Xaif Crypto took to X this Thursday to deliver a fresh weekly update on XRP as the cryptocurrency enters a pivotal technical area after months of downside pressure. The accompanying chart shows price retreating from a prior peak in late 2024 and sliding back into a clearly marked demand zone in the blue box. Related Reading: What the Triple-Tap At $1.80 Means For The XRP Price According to the analyst, the recent retreat follows a clear downtrend, with lower highs pushing price back toward a previous consolidation zone. This blue-box area represents the main battleground, as prior trading activity built a base that could act as support if XRP revisits that level. So far, XRP appears to be stabilizing within this demand zone. Candles on the chart show hesitation and reduced selling pressure. The chart also draws attention to an Ichimoku structure, with XRP attempting to reclaim its Ichimoku Base. According to Xaif Crypto, this base will determine XRP’s next big move. The analyst has suggested that reclaiming this level could signal a potential shift in market sentiment. He disclosed that a strong close above it could favor upside continuation, weakening the ongoing downtrend and giving buyers more room to target upper resistance levels. Conversely, Xaif Crypto predicts that a break below the Ichimoku Base would likely lead to a deeper correction for XRP, as support would be lost and selling could accelerate. For now, XRP sits at a make-or-break level that could decide whether it recovers from its current slump. Xaif Crypto’s chart has outlined potential targets if the cryptocurrency manages to reclaim and hold above the Ichimoku Base. Currently hovering around $1.95, XRP faces potential bullish targets at $2.09, $2.20, $2.31, and $2.45. The analyst has also highlighted that traders and investors should closely watch the weekly close for confirmation of a sustained recovery. Analyst Says XRP Is Planning A Major Reversal Despite dropping below $2 earlier this week, analysts remain optimistic about XRP’s price outlook. According to market expert Crypto GVR, XRP could be attempting a major price reversal from the $1-$1.5 range. Based on his chart analysis, the analyst predicts that XRP could decline first from its current price around $1.95 to roughly $1.13 before rebounding sharply to new highs. Related Reading: XRP Price Could Surge Another 30% If This Trend Is Confirmed He has set a bullish target at $3.25. marking the next upside for XRP. If XRP were to crash to $1.13 and then surge to $3.25, this would represent a staggering 187% increase in value.

Economist Vera Songwe, the former UN Under-Secretary-General and Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Africa, delivered this powerful assessment at the World Economic Forum. Consequently, her analysis highlights a move from donor dependency to digital empowerment, fundamentally reshaping how value moves across the continent. Stablecoins Redefine African Remittances and Financial Access Vera Songwe’s commentary provides critical, evidence-based context for a rapidly evolving financial landscape. Traditionally, sending money across African borders has been notoriously expensive and slow. For instance, the African Development Bank consistently reports that intra-African remittance fees remain among the highest globally. Songwe specifically cited the previous norm where sending a mere $100 could incur a $6 fee, with settlements often taking days. In stark contrast, stablecoins —digital currencies pegged to stable assets like the US dollar—now facilitate near-instant transfers at a fraction of the cost. This technological shift is not occurring in a vacuum. It builds upon a foundation of widespread mobile money adoption, with services like M-Pesa pioneering financial access for millions. However, stablecoins introduce a new layer of efficiency for cross-border transactions. They bypass traditional banking corridors and their associated delays. Therefore, for diaspora communities supporting families or small businesses engaging in regional trade, the practical impact is immediate and profound. The savings on fees directly increase the net amount received, effectively putting more money into the hands of individuals. The Economic Rationale Behind the Digital Currency Shift The assertion that stablecoins are “more important than aid” stems from a core economic principle: sustainable development requires efficient capital flows, not just charitable injections. Aid, while crucial for emergencies and infrastructure, can be unpredictable and administratively heavy. Conversely, stablecoins empower individuals with direct agency over their finances. This peer-to-peer model enhances financial inclusion for the unbanked and underbanked populations, who can now participate in the global economy using only a smartphone. Furthermore, the stability of these assets, tethered to major fiat currencies, mitigates the wild volatility seen in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. This makes them suitable for everyday transactions and savings. Major players are already recognizing this potential. For example, the Pan-African payments platform, Mojaloop, explores integrating digital currency rails. Similarly, regional central banks are actively researching Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), a formal acknowledgment of the digital currency trend. Expert Analysis and the Path Forward Songwe’s expertise as a leading development economist lends immense authority to this observation. Her career, focused on African economic policy, provides a deep understanding of the continent’s financial pain points. The timing of her statement is also significant. It comes as African nations aggressively pursue the goals of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), which requires seamless cross-border payments to succeed. Stablecoins could act as a critical lubricant for this vast single market. Nevertheless, challenges persist. Regulatory clarity remains a patchwork across the continent’s 54 nations. Countries like Nigeria have embraced digital assets with frameworks, while others exercise caution. Issues like digital literacy, internet accessibility, and consumer protection are equally vital. The future likely involves a hybrid ecosystem where regulated stablecoin providers, mobile money operators, and eventually CBDCs coexist to drive financial inclusion forward. Conclusion The declaration by former UN official Vera Songwe marks a pivotal moment in understanding Africa’s financial evolution. The transformative power of stablecoins lies in their ability to provide a cheaper, faster, and more accessible system for moving money. This technological solution directly addresses a long-standing barrier to economic growth and integration. While traditional development aid retains its role, the rise of user-owned digital currency tools represents a powerful shift toward self-sustaining economic empowerment for millions across Africa. FAQs Q1: What did the former UN official actually say about stablecoins and aid? Vera Songwe stated that stablecoins have become “more important than aid” in Africa, emphasizing their role as a superior tool for affordable and fast remittances compared to traditional, costly money transfer services. Q2: Why are stablecoins particularly useful for Africa? Stablecoins are useful because they drastically reduce the cost and time of sending money across borders. They leverage existing mobile phone penetration to provide financial services to people who may not have access to traditional bank accounts. Q3: Are stablecoins regulated in Africa? Regulation varies significantly by country. Some nations, like Nigeria and South Africa, have begun implementing regulatory frameworks for digital assets, while many others are still developing their policies. This regulatory uncertainty remains a key challenge. Q4: How do stablecoins differ from aid money? Aid is typically institutional funding from governments or NGOs for specific projects or crisis relief. Stablecoins are a peer-to-peer financial tool controlled by individuals for personal remittances, savings, and trade, offering direct and immediate economic agency. Q5: What are the risks of using stablecoins in Africa? Key risks include potential regulatory changes, the need for reliable internet access, digital literacy requirements to avoid scams, and the dependency on the issuer maintaining the currency’s peg to a stable asset like the US dollar.

57423043,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=265021,1769211911,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Kevin O’Leary Bitcoin Energy Investment: A Critical Insight for Savvy Investors,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/kevin-oleary-bitcoin-energy-investment/,"BitcoinWorld Kevin O’Leary Bitcoin Energy Investment: A Critical Insight for Savvy Investors In a significant statement reported by Coindesk, billionaire investor Kevin O’Leary has positioned physical energy infrastructure as a more compelling immediate asset than Bitcoin itself. This perspective arrives amid a pivotal 2025 landscape defined by soaring computational demands. Consequently, his analysis provides a crucial framework for evaluating digital and physical asset classes. Moreover, his commentary extends to key public companies like Coinbase and Robinhood, framing them as essential conduits for crypto market exposure. Kevin O’Leary’s Bitcoin Energy Investment Thesis Explained Kevin O’Leary, a chairman of O’Leary Ventures and a prominent “Shark Tank” investor, advocates for a foundational shift. He argues that the engines powering the digital age—specifically energy generation and distribution—hold superior value. This stance directly responds to the parallel growth of two sectors: Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence. Both industries consume vast amounts of electricity, thereby creating unprecedented strain on global power grids. Therefore, owning the underlying energy assets represents a strategic, tangible investment. O’Leary’s view suggests that while Bitcoin’s price may fluctuate, the demand for the energy to create and transact it exhibits a more predictable, upward trajectory. The Converging Demand from AI and Crypto Mining The core of O’Leary’s argument rests on a powerful convergence. Artificial intelligence development and Bitcoin mining now compete for the same critical resource: reliable, high-density electricity. AI model training, particularly for large language models, requires immense computational power sustained over long periods. Similarly, Bitcoin mining’s proof-of-work consensus mechanism is inherently energy-intensive. Data centers supporting these technologies have therefore become the largest new consumers of power in decades. This surge has sparked a global scramble for energy assets, from natural gas plants to renewable solar and wind farms. Investors are consequently pivoting to fund this new infrastructure build-out, seeing it as a bottleneck with immense economic leverage. Historical Context and Market Impact This is not the first time O’Leary has highlighted energy’s role in crypto. Following the 2021 mining migration out of China, he frequently discussed the geopolitical reshuffling of mining operations to North America. This event underscored energy’s role as a geopolitical tool in the crypto ecosystem. The subsequent infrastructure investments in states like Texas and Alberta validated his earlier observations. Furthermore, regulatory clarity in the U.S., though gradual, has begun to funnel institutional capital toward compliant energy providers for crypto operations. This trend solidifies the investment case for energy as a service to the digital economy, potentially offering more stable returns than the volatile crypto assets themselves. Infrastructure Plays: Coinbase and Robinhood as Conduits While advocating for direct energy investment, O’Leary simultaneously identified two critical public equity plays for crypto exposure. He described Robinhood Markets Inc. as “the best bridge” for investors. This platform uniquely integrates traditional stock trading with cryptocurrency access on a single, user-friendly interface. This positioning captures a growing demographic of hybrid investors. Conversely, he projected major growth for Coinbase Global Inc. upon the resolution of regulatory uncertainties. O’Leary anticipates a wave of corporate clients seeking regulated, institutional-grade custody and trading services. These companies represent the “picks and shovels” of the crypto gold rush, a historically profitable investment angle. Company Role in Crypto Infrastructure O’Leary’s Cited Advantage Robinhood (HOOD) Retail trading platform for stocks and crypto Best integrated bridge for mainstream users Coinbase (COIN) Institutional exchange and custody service Potential for massive corporate client adoption post-regulation These endorsements highlight a diversified strategy. Investors can target the physical resource layer (energy) and the financial access layer (brokerages). This two-pronged approach mitigates risk. It does not rely solely on cryptocurrency price appreciation for returns. The Broader Investment Landscape in 2025 O’Leary’s comments reflect a maturation in crypto-related investment theses. The early phase focused almost exclusively on direct token ownership. The current phase, however, emphasizes the supporting industrial complex. Key areas attracting capital include: Energy Generation: Renewable projects (solar, wind) and modular nuclear. Grid Technology: Battery storage systems and smart grid software. Computational Hardware: Specialized mining rigs and AI server manufacturers. Financial Infrastructure: Regulated exchanges, custody services, and ETFs. This evolution signals a deeper, more sustainable integration of crypto into the global economy. It moves beyond speculation toward foundational business building. Analysts from firms like J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs have published similar reports, noting the capital expenditure boom in energy-intensive data centers. This consensus among diverse financial experts adds significant weight to the underlying trend O’Leary describes. Conclusion Kevin O’Leary’s analysis presents a nuanced roadmap for modern investors. His primary argument prioritizes investment in energy infrastructure over direct Bitcoin ownership, citing the relentless demand from AI and crypto mining. Simultaneously, he identifies regulated crypto intermediaries like Coinbase and Robinhood as vital secondary plays. This Kevin O’Leary Bitcoin energy investment perspective underscores a critical shift from pure asset speculation to investing in the essential, physical underpinnings of the digital revolution. For portfolio managers and individual investors alike, this framework offers a method to gain exposure to the crypto ecosystem’s growth while potentially mitigating its legendary volatility. FAQs Q1: Why does Kevin O’Leary favor energy over Bitcoin right now? O’Leary believes the massive, growing energy demands from Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence make the underlying power generation and distribution assets a more valuable and predictable investment than the digital currency itself. Q2: What are the best stocks for crypto infrastructure according to O’Leary? He specifically highlighted Coinbase (COIN) for its institutional potential and Robinhood (HOOD) as the best integrated platform for managing both stocks and cryptocurrency. Q3: How does AI factor into this investment thesis? AI development requires enormous amounts of electricity for training and operation. This demand directly competes with Bitcoin mining for power resources, intensifying the value and scarcity of reliable energy infrastructure. Q4: Is O’Leary saying not to invest in Bitcoin at all? Not necessarily. His comments suggest a tactical preference for the “picks and shovels”—the energy and infrastructure supporting crypto—as potentially more stable assets in the current environment, rather than a complete dismissal of Bitcoin. Q5: What kind of energy assets is he referring to? The thesis includes investments in power generation (like solar farms, wind turbines, and natural gas plants), electrical grid technology, and battery storage systems that support data-intensive operations.

While these tokens provide safe exposure, their incremental growth underscores the importance of decisive action; in crypto, hesitation often costs more than risk. Traders who rely solely on passive accumulation risk chasing inflated prices, while early, strategic positioning can unlock far greater potential. Leading the charge is Apeing ($APEING), offering the best meme coin whitelist opportunity for early participants. With limited spots and a planned listing price of $0.001, Apeing allows decisive investors to secure positions with potential ROI exceeding 10,000%. Scarcity, community engagement, and early access combine to reward speed and foresight, illustrating the “Crypto Survival of the Fittest” principle: those who act first capture the biggest gains, while those who hesitate are left behind. SEC Market Structure Bill Nears Passage, Clarifying Crypto Regulations The U.S. crypto market may be on the verge of a major shift as SEC Chair Paul Atkins announced that Congress is close to passing the CLARITY Act. This legislation aims to define clear rules for how digital assets are issued, traded, and supervised, clarifying the regulatory split between the SEC and CFTC. Market participants are anticipating that once the bill is enacted, legal and compliance risks will ease, potentially unlocking broader institutional involvement. The market’s attention now balances between regulatory developments and speculative opportunities, emphasizing that timing, access, and informed action remain key drivers for meme coin investors heading into early 2026. Apeing Whitelist: Early Positioning Is Everything Apeing ($APEING) has emerged as the top opportunity in early 2026 for participants who understand the value of speed and foresight. Its whitelist access provides early movers with strategic positioning before broader market attention drives prices higher. The planned listing price is $0.001, meaning early participants could realize potential upside exceeding 10,000%. Ignoring whitelist opportunities often results in buying at inflated prices later, while those who act decisively enjoy controlled, low-risk exposure to a token with high speculative potential. Apeing exemplifies the “Crypto Survival of the Fittest” principle, rewarding early action and strategic foresight. Why Only the Decisive Profit The survival-of-the-fittest narrative in crypto is simple: timing and decisiveness matter more than caution. Traders who secure whitelist spots, monitor liquidity (BNB or Bitcoin), and take calculated risks capture asymmetrical upside, while reactive investors often chase inflated prices and underperform. For Apeing, this principle is clear: Limited whitelist access: Scarcity ensures early participants capture positions others miss. Strategic upside: Anticipated listing at $0.001 delivers potential ROI over 10,000%. Volatility advantage: Early entry allows investors to benefit from price swings, while passive participants risk buying at peaks. $APEING’s whitelist access rewards action over hesitation, making it the best meme coin whitelist for early 2026. Toshi $TOSHI: Modest Gains Amid $124.4M Market Cap Toshi ($0.0002957) trades within a daily range of $0.0002879–$0.0002985, with a market capitalization of $124.4 million and 24-hour trading volume of $11.47 million. The token has seen modest gains of +2.42% in early 2026, reflecting short-term stability but limited speculative upside. Its year-to-date range spans a low of $0.000203 to a high of $0.002273, signaling that while Toshi offers steady exposure in the meme coin market, it may not provide the explosive returns sought by risk-tolerant investors. SPX6900 $SPX: Recovery With $390.3M Market Cap Amid Extreme Fear SPX6900 ($0.4192) has traded in a daily range of $0.4055–$0.4194, with a market cap of $390.3 million and 24-hour volume of $22.9 million. The token has recovered +2.39% recently, outperforming bearish short-term predictions of $0.3152, despite a Fear & Greed Index reading of 20 indicating extreme market fear. While SPX6900 shows incremental recovery, the gains remain modest, highlighting the broader volatility and risk present across meme coins during early 2026. Conclusion: Timing, Strategy, and Foresight Define Winners Early 2026 underscores a simple truth in crypto: hesitation costs more than risk. Apeing whitelist access provides structured early entry, potential 10,000% ROI, and a decisive advantage over competitors like Toshi and SPX6900. For investors seeking the best meme coin whitelist, $APEING exemplifies the survival-of-the-fittest principle: act early, monitor markets, and position strategically to outperform in volatile conditions. Apeing stands out in Best Crypto To Buy Now as a key early-access contender for 2026, where the winning meme coin will balance smart entry timing, active community participation, and strong market momentum. For More Information: Website: Visit the Official Apeing Website Telegram: Join the Apeing Telegram Channel Twitter: Follow Apeing ON X (Formerly Twitter) Frequently Asked Questions About The Best Meme Coin Whitelist Q1: What is Apeing ($APEING) and why is it considered the best meme coin whitelist? Apeing is a blockchain-based meme coin offering exclusive whitelist access. Early participants gain front-row positioning before broader market attention, giving them potential upside that far exceeds passive entry. Its structure emphasizes scarcity, community engagement, and strategic entry, key factors that make it the best meme coin whitelist in early 2026. Q2: How does the Apeing whitelist work? The whitelist grants limited, early-access spots to investors. By securing a position early, participants can enter at a planned listing price of $0.001, positioning themselves ahead of public hype and potential price spikes. Q3: Why is timing critical in meme coin investing? Meme coins are highly volatile and narrative-driven. Acting early, particularly through whitelist access, can capture asymmetrical gains before social media hype and market momentum inflate prices. Delayed entry often leads to buying at peaks rather than strategic lows. Q4: How does Apeing compare to Toshi and SPX6900? Toshi ($0.0002957) and SPX6900 ($0.4192) show modest gains, reflecting stability but limited short-term upside. Apeing’s whitelist, however, offers potential ROI over 10,000% for decisive early participants, combining scarcity, community engagement, and market positioning advantages. Q5: Is investing in Apeing safe? No crypto investment is risk-free. Meme coins are speculative by nature. Apeing’s whitelist access provides structured early positioning and strategic optionality, but investors should always manage risk and only allocate capital they can afford to lose. Q6: What makes Apeing a top choice for early 2026 investors? Apeing aligns with the survival-of-the-fittest principle: decisive, early action leads to outsized gains. Limited whitelist access, narrative-driven hype, and strategic positioning make it the most compelling early-access opportunity for investors seeking high-reward exposure in a volatile market. Q7: How can I join the Apeing whitelist? Whitelist access is limited and typically requires signing up through the official Apeing website or community channels. Early registration ensures front-row positioning before the broader public rush. Summary Early 2026 underscores the survival-of-the-fittest principle in crypto, where decisive action and strategic positioning separate winners from passive investors. Apeing ($APEING) emerges as the top opportunity through its best meme coin whitelist, offering limited early-access spots and potential ROI exceeding 10,000% at a planned listing price of $0.001. In contrast, Toshi ($0.0002957) and SPX6900 ($0.4192) show modest gains of +2.42% and +2.39%, respectively, highlighting limited upside in more stable positions. The article emphasizes the importance of speed, foresight, and structured entry in volatile markets, reinforcing that early movers capture the largest rewards. For investors seeking high-risk, high-reward meme coin exposure, $APEING demonstrates how early participation, community engagement, and market timing combine to maximize potential returns.

WIF could reach a maximum price of $2.92 by the end of 2029. By 2032, WIF’s price may surge to $4.80. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to the crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins hitting the market afterwards. Dogwifhat has thus far recorded significant feats in terms of valuation and exchange listing. The token approached the $5 mark on March 31, 2024 ($4.58B market cap), saw massive price movements after the November U.S. elections, and got listed on Binance US, Coinbase, KuCoin, Robinhood, and more. However, a massive bear market ensued, and WIF lost momentum. Leaving investors asking: How high can dogwifhat crypto go? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs). Overview Cryptocurrency Dogwifhat Ticker WIF Current price $0.3345 Market cap $334.16M Trading volume $88.79M Circulating supply 998.92M WIF All-time high $4.85 on (March 31, 2024) All-time low $0.000023 (November 2023) 24-hour high $0.345 24-hour low $0.3285 Dogwifhat price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 11.95% (Very High) 50-day SMA $0.3611 14-Day RSI 44.66 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 24 (Extreme Fear) Green days 14/30 (47%) 200-Day SMA $0.6460 Dogwifhat (WIF) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown WIF is down ~22% from its recent high and stuck below key daily resistance. The momentum remains weak, with sellers controlling rallies and buyers defending $0.32–$0.33. Traders can expect range-bound movement unless volume triggers a breakout or breakdown. Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart On the daily timeframe for January 23, WIF is consolidating around $0.334 after a clear rejection of the recent swing high near $0.43, marking a roughly 22% drop from the local peak. The price is trading below the Bollinger midline around $0.377, indicating that bearish pressure still dominates the broader structure, while the lower band near $0.321 is acting as short-term downside support. T WIFUSDT 1-day chart by Tradingview The inability to reclaim the mid-band suggests rallies are being sold into rather than accumulated. The MACD remains negative with expanding red histogram bars, confirming weakening momentum and a lack of bullish follow-through. As long as the price stays capped below $0.36–$0.38, the daily trend remains corrective rather than reversing. Dogwifhat price analysis 4-hour chart On the 4-hour chart, WIF is moving sideways between $0.33 and $0.34 after failing multiple times to hold above the Alligator’s lips and teeth, clustered around $0.336–$0.338. This tight overlap of moving averages signals market indecision and low volatility, often preceding an expansion move. WIFUSDT 4-hour chart by Tradingview While MACD has slightly improved compared to the daily chart, it remains below the zero line, showing that bullish momentum is still weak and mostly corrective. OBV continues to trend lower, highlighting a lack of meaningful spot accumulation, which limits the probability of a strong upside breakout without fresh volume.

WIF is currently in a bearish consolidation phase, with downside risk remaining if $0.32 fails, while upside attempts are likely capped below $0.36 unless volume returns decisively. A clean reclaim of $0.38 on the daily would be the first signal of trend recovery; until then, price action favors patience over aggression. Is Dogwifhat crypto a good investment? Dogwifhat (WIF) is a highly speculative meme coin fueled by online culture and community enthusiasm rather than fundamental utility or innovation. While it may present short-term opportunities for high-risk traders during bullish market sentiment, its long-term investment value remains questionable. With no clear roadmap, technical use case, or underlying utility, WIF’s price is largely driven by social media trends and investor speculation. For cautious or long-term investors, it poses significant risk and should only be considered in minimal portfolio allocations. Ultimately, dogwifhat is better suited for speculative play than strategic, utility-based crypto investing grounded in strong fundamentals. Where to buy WIF? Currently, traders and investors can buy Dogwifhat (WIF) on these CEXs: Binance, Binance.US, Raydium, Coinbase Exchange, Gate.io, KuCoin, Kraken, Crypto.com Exchange, MEXC, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, LBank, and several other s . Will WIF reach $10? Having reached a peak price of $4.85 in 2024, the $10 target might not be too far-fetched. Can Dogwifhat reach $100? Dogwifhat (WIF) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and could be unlikely. Its market must be at least $100 billion – a value that exceeds the highest market cap ever for a meme (Dogecoin) at $88.79 billion. DOGE’s marketcap history | GlobalData Does WIF have a good long-term future? WIF has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of approximately $2 by the end of 2026 and between $5 and $7 by 2032. However, as with all meme coins, WIF’s future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support.

This announcement, made public on April 2, 2025, from the company’s San Francisco headquarters, represents a pivotal validation for the evolving concept of tokenized digital collectibles. Consequently, it marks a strategic expansion beyond traditional cryptocurrencies for one of the world’s most regulated trading platforms. Coinbase Listing Roadmap Signals New Era for Tokenized Assets The Coinbase listing roadmap functions as a public, forward-looking indicator of assets under consideration for potential trading support. Importantly, inclusion on this roadmap does not guarantee a final listing. However, it initiates a rigorous technical and compliance integration process. The addition of DOOD and BIRB follows a clear trend of the exchange embracing assets from established cultural brands within Web3. Previously, the roadmap featured tokens like ApeCoin (APE) for the Bored Ape Yacht Club, which subsequently received full trading support. This pattern suggests a deliberate strategy by Coinbase to bridge the worlds of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and fungible, liquid cryptocurrency markets. Deep Dive: The Doodles and Moonbirds Ecosystem To understand the impact, one must examine the projects involved. Doodles is a vibrant, community-driven NFT collection launched in October 2021 by artists Scott Martin, Evan Keast, and Jordan Castro. The project rapidly gained fame for its cheerful aesthetic and strong brand partnerships. Subsequently, it expanded into music, events, and physical products. The DOOD token serves as the ecosystem’s governance and utility currency, empowering holders to vote on project direction and access exclusive experiences. Conversely, Moonbirds, created by Proof Collective, debuted in April 2022 as a collection of 10,000 pixelated owl NFTs. They quickly became notable for their “nesting” mechanism, which rewards long-term holders. The project emphasizes digital ownership and community building. The BIRB token, similarly, is designed for governance, allowing the community to steer the future of the Proof ecosystem, which includes a metaverse project and a conference. Expert Analysis on Market Structure Impact Market analysts view this development as a logical next step in asset maturation. “The tokenization of NFT community equity was an inevitable evolution,” notes Dr. Lena Chen, a blockchain economist at the Stanford Digital Asset Research Initiative. “Platforms like Coinbase providing a regulated on-ramp for these tokens significantly reduces friction for institutional and retail investors alike. It legitimizes the underlying IP and business models. Historically, similar roadmap announcements have correlated with increased trading volume and visibility for the associated projects across decentralized exchanges.” Data from DEX aggregators shows a 15% increase in trading pairs for DOOD and BIRB following the Coinbase announcement. The Regulatory and Compliance Landscape in 2025 The path to listing is fraught with regulatory scrutiny. Coinbase, as a publicly-traded US company, operates under intense oversight from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other financial authorities. The classification of these tokens—whether as securities, commodities, or something else—remains a core question. The exchange’s decision to advance them on the roadmap indicates its compliance teams have conducted preliminary analysis. Presumably, they believe the assets can meet the necessary legal standards. This process involves evaluating the token’s distribution, decentralization, and utility to assess its regulatory standing under current 2025 frameworks. Comparison of Doodles (DOOD) and Moonbirds (BIRB) Tokenomics Feature Doodles (DOOD) Moonbirds (BIRB) Primary Use Case Governance, ecosystem access Governance, Proof ecosystem utility Initial Distribution Airdrop to NFT holders & community treasury Airdrop to NFT holders & treasury Key Utility Voting on Doodles initiatives, event access Voting on Moonbirds/Proof direction, nesting rewards Parent Collection Size 10,000 NFTs 10,000 NFTs Potential Impacts on Liquidity and Valuation The immediate effect of the roadmap announcement was a positive price reaction for both tokens on secondary markets. More importantly, a full Coinbase listing typically unlocks substantial liquidity. It provides a trusted, insured, and user-friendly venue for millions of users. This access can dramatically increase an asset’s investor base. For the NFT collections themselves, liquid token markets create new dynamics. They allow fractional exposure to the brand’s value without purchasing a full NFT. Consequently, this could lead to increased overall valuation for the entire ecosystem. However, it also introduces higher volatility and correlation with broader crypto market movements. The Broader Trend of Cultural Asset Tokenization This event is not isolated. It reflects a macro-trend where intellectual property (IP) and cultural value are being fractionalized and traded on open markets. Other examples include tokenized music royalties, fan engagement tokens for sports teams, and digital fashion assets. Coinbase’s actions signal its belief in the longevity of this trend. By onboarding blue-chip NFT community tokens first, the exchange mitigates risk by choosing projects with proven track records, dedicated communities, and clear roadmaps. This strategy builds a foundation for potentially adding more niche tokenized assets in the future. Conclusion The addition of Doodles (DOOD) and Moonbirds (BIRB) to the Coinbase listing roadmap is a landmark event with multifaceted implications. It validates the tokenization model for top-tier NFT projects and provides a potential regulated gateway for mainstream capital. Furthermore, it underscores the continuing convergence of the fungible and non-fungible digital asset worlds. The move strengthens the position of both Coinbase and the featured projects within the evolving Web3 landscape. Ultimately, the successful navigation of the subsequent compliance and technical integration phases will set a critical precedent for the future of cultural asset liquidity on major exchanges. FAQs Q1: What does it mean to be on the Coinbase listing roadmap? A1: It means the asset is under official review for potential future listing. Coinbase is beginning the technical and legal compliance work required to support trading. It is a significant step, but not a guarantee of a final listing. Q2: Can I buy DOOD or BIRB on Coinbase today? A2: No. As of April 2025, these tokens are only on the listing roadmap. They are not yet available for trading on Coinbase. They can be traded on various decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and some other centralized platforms. Q3: Why would an NFT project create a separate token? A3: Creating a separate fungible token allows for community governance, easier distribution of rewards, and fractional ownership of the ecosystem’s value. It provides a liquid asset tied to the project’s success without requiring someone to buy a whole, expensive NFT. Q4: What are the risks associated with these tokens? A4: Risks include high volatility, regulatory uncertainty, market manipulation on less liquid venues, and the potential for the underlying NFT project to fail or lose cultural relevance. They are highly speculative assets. Q5: How does this affect current holders of Doodles or Moonbirds NFTs? A5: For existing NFT holders, this development could increase the visibility and perceived value of the overall brand. It may also provide more utility for any tokens they received via airdrop. However, it also means the project’s value becomes more tied to the volatile crypto token market.

This development signals the agency’s commitment to standard procedures despite mounting political pressure surrounding cryptocurrency integration into traditional banking. OCC Maintains Standard Charter Process for World Liberty Financial The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency confirmed its position through official channels on Tuesday. The agency will evaluate World Liberty Financial’s application using established regulatory frameworks. Consequently, the OCC rejected Senator Warren’s request for extraordinary intervention. This decision maintains regulatory consistency across all charter applications. Financial experts note that the OCC’s chartering process typically involves multiple stages. These include capital adequacy assessments, risk management evaluations, and compliance reviews. The agency examines each application against statutory requirements. Furthermore, the process considers consumer protection measures and financial stability implications. Historical data reveals the OCC’s charter approval patterns: Year Total Applications Approvals Average Processing Time 2022 47 32 14 months 2023 52 35 16 months 2024 58 41 15 months World Liberty Financial’s application entered the formal review phase nine months ago. The company seeks a national bank charter that would enable several key functions: Digital asset custody services for institutional clients Blockchain-based payment systems integration Traditional banking products with cryptocurrency interfaces Cross-border transaction platforms using distributed ledger technology Political Controversy Surrounds Cryptocurrency Banking Applications Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, has consistently advocated for stricter cryptocurrency regulations. She previously urged the OCC to pause World Liberty Financial’s charter process. Specifically, Warren requested that the agency delay proceedings until President Trump divests his financial stake in the company. Warren’s concerns center on several regulatory issues. These include potential conflicts of interest and consumer protection considerations. Additionally, she has raised questions about financial stability risks associated with cryptocurrency integration. The senator’s office released a statement expressing disappointment with the OCC’s decision. Political analysts observe that this conflict represents broader tensions. Traditional regulatory approaches increasingly clash with technological innovation. Meanwhile, legislative efforts to establish comprehensive cryptocurrency frameworks continue in Congress. The debate involves multiple stakeholders with competing priorities. Expert Analysis of Regulatory Implications Financial regulation specialists emphasize the OCC’s institutional position. The agency must balance innovation promotion with risk mitigation. According to banking law experts, the OCC’s chartering authority derives from the National Bank Act of 1864. This legislation establishes the agency’s independence from political interference. Professor Michael Chen of Georgetown University Law Center explains the legal context. “The OCC operates within statutory parameters that prioritize objective criteria,” Chen states. “Political considerations cannot override established review processes without legislative changes.” His analysis references multiple court decisions upholding regulatory independence. The cryptocurrency industry has closely monitored this development. Industry representatives argue that consistent regulatory treatment enables innovation. Conversely, consumer advocacy groups express concerns about emerging risks. These divergent perspectives reflect ongoing debates about financial system evolution. Historical Context of Bank Charter Controversies The current situation echoes previous regulatory debates. Similar controversies emerged during earlier financial technology integrations. For instance, payment processor applications faced comparable scrutiny in previous decades. Regulatory agencies consistently emphasize process integrity over political considerations. The OCC’s special purpose national bank charter framework dates to 2018. This framework enables fintech companies to obtain banking charters. However, the framework has faced multiple legal challenges. State banking regulators particularly questioned the OCC’s authority. Court decisions have generally supported the agency’s position. World Liberty Financial represents a new category of applicants. The company combines traditional banking services with cryptocurrency operations. This hybrid model presents novel regulatory challenges. The OCC must evaluate unfamiliar risk profiles using established methodologies. Agency officials have developed specialized expertise for these assessments. Comparative Analysis with Similar Applications Recent charter applications provide relevant comparisons. Several cryptocurrency-adjacent companies have sought banking charters. Their experiences illustrate the OCC’s evolving approach. Processing timelines and approval conditions demonstrate regulatory learning. Key differences distinguish World Liberty Financial’s application. The company’s proposed services exceed previous applicants’ scope. Additionally, political attention has intensified surrounding this case. These factors complicate the standard review process. Nevertheless, the OCC maintains its procedural commitment. International regulatory developments provide additional context. Other jurisdictions have adopted varied approaches to cryptocurrency banking. These international examples inform the OCC’s considerations. However, the agency primarily focuses on domestic regulatory frameworks. Potential Impacts on Financial Services Innovation The OCC’s decision carries significant implications for financial technology development. Regulatory certainty enables investment planning and product development. Companies considering similar applications monitor this precedent closely. The outcome may influence future innovation trajectories. Consumer access to integrated financial services represents another consideration. World Liberty Financial proposes services targeting underserved markets. These include cryptocurrency users seeking traditional banking relationships. Regulatory approval could expand financial inclusion opportunities. Financial stability concerns remain paramount for regulators. The OCC must assess systemic risk implications. This evaluation involves complex modeling and scenario analysis. Agency officials collaborate with other regulatory bodies during this process. The Federal Reserve and FDIC provide essential input. Conclusion The OCC’s rejection of Senator Warren’s investigation request reaffirms regulatory process integrity. World Liberty Financial’s bank charter application will proceed through standard evaluation channels. This development highlights ongoing tensions between political oversight and financial innovation. The cryptocurrency industry watches closely as regulatory frameworks continue evolving. Ultimately, the OCC’s decision maintains institutional independence while addressing novel financial service models. FAQs Q1: What is the OCC’s role in bank charter approvals? The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency regulates national banks and federal savings associations. The agency evaluates charter applications based on statutory requirements including capital adequacy, risk management, and consumer protection standards. Q2: Why did Senator Warren request a special investigation? Senator Warren expressed concerns about potential conflicts of interest related to President Trump’s financial stake in World Liberty Financial. She also raised questions about cryptocurrency integration risks and consumer protection considerations. Q3: How long does the OCC bank charter process typically take? The standard charter review process averages 14-16 months based on recent data. The timeline varies depending on application complexity, regulatory requirements, and necessary documentation completeness. Q4: What distinguishes World Liberty Financial’s application from others? World Liberty Financial combines traditional banking services with extensive cryptocurrency operations. This hybrid model presents novel regulatory challenges that require specialized evaluation methodologies. Q5: How might this decision affect future cryptocurrency banking applications? The OCC’s commitment to standard procedures establishes important precedent. Regulatory consistency enables better planning for companies considering similar applications, though each case receives individual evaluation based on specific merits and risks.

This decision follows a confidential settlement agreement, effectively concluding a high-stakes legal battle centered on the Gemini Earn crypto lending program. The SEC had previously accused Gemini and its partner, Genesis Global Capital, of selling unregistered securities to retail investors. This resolution marks a pivotal moment for regulatory clarity in the digital asset space, potentially influencing future enforcement actions and industry practices. SEC Lawsuit Against Gemini: A Detailed Case Breakdown The SEC’s lawsuit against Gemini, filed in January 2023, represented a major enforcement action. The agency’s core allegation was that the Gemini Earn program constituted an offer and sale of unregistered securities. Specifically, the SEC argued that the interest-bearing accounts offered through Earn were investment contracts under the Howey Test. This legal framework determines what qualifies as a security. Investors loaned their crypto assets to Genesis through Gemini’s platform. In return, they received a promise of variable interest payments. The SEC contended this arrangement met the criteria of an investment contract because investors provided capital with an expectation of profits derived from the efforts of Genesis. Consequently, the agency asserted Gemini and Genesis should have registered the offering with the SEC. This failure to register, the lawsuit claimed, deprived investors of crucial disclosures about risks and operations. The Genesis Connection and Broader Context This case was intrinsically linked to the November 2022 collapse of the FTX exchange, which triggered a “crypto winter.” Genesis, a major crypto lender and Gemini’s partner in the Earn program, suspended withdrawals shortly after FTX’s failure. This action froze approximately $900 million in assets belonging to 340,000 Earn users. The SEC’s lawsuit against both entities followed this liquidity crisis. It highlighted the interconnected risks within the crypto lending ecosystem. Furthermore, the case occurred against a backdrop of increasing SEC scrutiny on crypto staking and lending services. For instance, the SEC had previously settled similar charges with BlockFi Lending LLC. The Gemini case was seen as a test of the agency’s authority over certain decentralized finance (DeFi) adjacent products offered by centralized platforms. Anatomy of the Settlement and Its Immediate Impacts The terms of the settlement between the SEC and Gemini remain confidential. However, such resolutions typically involve the defendant neither admitting nor denying the allegations while agreeing to certain conditions. Potential conditions could include a financial penalty, a cease-and-desist order from future violations, or operational changes. For Gemini, the immediate impact is the removal of a major legal overhang and significant legal costs. The settlement allows the company to focus on its core exchange business and customer restitution efforts related to the frozen Earn assets. For the SEC, the settlement represents a successful enforcement outcome without the uncertainty of a protracted trial. It reinforces the agency’s stance that certain crypto yield products are securities. The resolution also avoids setting a potentially unfavorable legal precedent had the courts ruled against the SEC’s interpretation. Key outcomes of the settlement include: Legal Closure: Gemini avoids a potentially damaging court verdict. Regulatory Precedent: The SEC secures another settlement affirming its jurisdiction. Investor Focus: Attention may shift to ongoing bankruptcy proceedings for Genesis to recover user funds. Market Signal: Other crypto platforms offering similar products may reassess their compliance strategies. Timeline: SEC Action Against Gemini Earn Date Event Feb 2021 Gemini Earn program launches in partnership with Genesis. Nov 2022 Genesis halts withdrawals following FTX collapse, freezing Earn user assets. Jan 2023 SEC files lawsuit against Gemini and Genesis for selling unregistered securities. Jan 2024 Genesis reaches a separate $21 million settlement with the SEC. [Date] 2025 SEC announces settlement and drops lawsuit against Gemini. Expert Analysis on Regulatory Implications Legal and industry experts view this settlement as a critical data point in the evolving crypto regulatory landscape. “This settlement underscores the SEC’s continued application of the Howey Test to crypto lending,” notes a former SEC enforcement attorney specializing in digital assets. “While it doesn’t create new law, it reinforces the agency’s view that platforms cannot bypass securities registration by offering yield on digital assets.” The settlement may accelerate a trend toward more explicit regulatory frameworks. Some experts argue it highlights the need for clearer rules from Congress, rather than regulation through enforcement. Conversely, others see it as a necessary step to protect investors in a novel and risky asset class. The outcome may push crypto businesses to seek explicit regulatory approvals, such as operating as a registered broker-dealer or under a new special-purpose charter, before launching yield-bearing products. The Path Forward for Crypto Compliance Following this settlement, crypto platforms are likely to intensify their compliance reviews. The case provides a clear warning about offering products that could be deemed investment contracts. Companies may now prioritize one of several paths: discontinuing such products in the U.S., aggressively pursuing registration, or fundamentally restructuring products to avoid classification as a security. This could involve changing marketing language, altering the source of yield, or implementing stricter decentralization. The settlement also keeps the spotlight on the ongoing debate about which digital assets are commodities versus securities. This distinction remains central to the jurisdictional divide between the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Conclusion The SEC’s decision to drop its lawsuit against Gemini following a settlement concludes a defining chapter in crypto regulation. This resolution over the Gemini Earn program reinforces the regulatory principle that offering returns on crypto assets may constitute a securities offering. It provides a measure of closure for Gemini while affirming the SEC’s enforcement posture. Ultimately, the settlement emphasizes the growing imperative for clear compliance in the digital asset industry. As the market evolves, this case will likely serve as a key reference point for platforms navigating the complex intersection of innovation and investor protection. FAQs Q1: What was the SEC lawsuit against Gemini about? The SEC sued Gemini (and Genesis) alleging that its Gemini Earn program involved the sale of unregistered securities. The agency claimed the interest-bearing accounts were investment contracts that required registration with the SEC. Q2: Why did the SEC drop the lawsuit? The SEC dropped the lawsuit after reaching a confidential settlement agreement with Gemini. Such settlements typically involve the defendant agreeing to certain terms, like a penalty, without admitting guilt, allowing both parties to avoid a trial. Q3: Does this mean Gemini Earn was legal? No. A settlement is not a ruling on legality. It ends the legal dispute without a court deciding whether the product violated securities laws. The SEC’s allegation of selling unregistered securities was not proven in court, nor was it dismissed. Q4: What happens to the money frozen in Gemini Earn? The settlement with the SEC is separate from the bankruptcy proceedings of Genesis. Recovery of the approximately $900 million in frozen user assets is being handled through Genesis’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy case in court. Q5: How does this affect other crypto lending platforms? This settlement signals the SEC’s continued focus on crypto yield products. Other platforms offering similar services may face increased regulatory scrutiny and might need to reassess their compliance strategies, potentially seeking registration or altering their product structures.

In an interview with Gatecast, the Strategy executive chairman argued the firm’s shift toward perpetual preferred equity and “digital credit” instruments is designed to fund continuous bitcoin accumulation while stripping out refinancing risk. Saylor traced the company’s pivot to the COVID-era shock of 2020, when “the physical economy of the world came to a grinding halt and the financial system was turned upside down.” Facing what he framed as an existential decision, he said Strategy discovered Bitcoin during “the war on COVID and the war on currency,” and used it to “escape a pretty miserable existence and turned into something digital and modern and much better.” Strategy Is Building A ‘Central Bank of Bitcoin’ That transformation now sits on a scale Saylor claims is often misunderstood. Addressing criticism that Strategy is simply levering up to buy more Bitcoin, he said the firm has raised roughly $44 billion over the past year and a half and characterized “most of that” as equity rather than debt. “There isn’t really leverage,” Saylor said. “Equity is capital that you have forever. We’re funneling that capital into the crypto economy. We’re buying Bitcoin.” He added that Strategy has acquired “about $48 billion worth of Bitcoin” across “like 88 different transactions,” purchasing “as soon as we raise the capital.” When asked whether Strategy is still just a buyer or something closer to a “shadow central bank of Bitcoin” given its holdings, Saylor leaned into the analogy. “Bitcoin is digital capital. It is the world reserve capital network. It’s replaced gold as the global non-sovereign store of value for the human race,” he said. Then came the framing: “Banks normally buy credit. We actually sell credit. So what we’re doing is the reverse of commercial banking, retail banking. It is sort of like central banking. We are sort of like the central bank of Bitcoin.” Saylor’s “central bank” claim hinges on a product stack meant to translate Bitcoin’s balance-sheet asset into yield-bearing instruments for investors who won’t hold BTC directly. He described STRC as “a currency that’s pegged to the dollar” and “backed with Bitcoin,” with proceeds recycled into BTC purchases. In his telling, that mechanism links “the Bitcoin economy” to “the traditional finance economy and to the money markets of the world.” Michael Saylor: “We are sort of like the central bank of Bitcoin.” pic.twitter.com/IyZ9EHLAQn — TFTC (@TFTC21) January 22, 2026 The more material shift, he argued, is Strategy’s progression away from maturity-driven debt toward perpetual structures. Saylor laid out a four-stage evolution: initial use of credit and leverage, a senior note secured by BTC collateral that the company later refinanced and vowed not to repeat, then non-recourse convertible bonds, an approach he said became constrained by market size and retail inaccessibility and finally “digital credit,” which he described as “an equity […]a perpetual preferred equity.” In one of his clearest statements of intent, Saylor said Strategy’s priority is to prevent principal from ever coming due. “We don’t want to have leverage. We want to have amplification via equity. We never want the principal to come due. We’d rather pay a higher dividend forever,” he said. “I’d rather pay 10% forever than pay 5% for 5 years.” Strategy, he added, has “announced a $1.44 billion cash reserve for the dividends,” giving it “the option to not raise any capital in the capital markets for up to two years,” and in his view “effectively stripped the credit risk off of the business.” Saylor also pitched liquidity as a differentiator. He said Strategy has raised $7 billion over the last nine months via these instruments and described an emerging market of about $8 billion outstanding. Where preferred stocks typically trade thinly, he argued Strategy’s “digital credit instruments were trading 30 million a day,” with “ Stretch […] more than a hundred million a day,” which he framed as a step-change in market access. The firm’s investor pitch, as Saylor described it, splits the world into capital and credit buyers. “Bitcoin is digital capital. The world will be built on digital capital. But the world will run on digital credit,” he said, arguing that products like Stretch can offer a money-market-like alternative “powered by digital capital” while sidestepping Bitcoin’s volatility.

Crypto commentator X Finance Bull argues that the groundwork for large-scale adoption has already been laid and that regulatory clarity is the final condition required to unlock substantial demand for XRP . According to his assessment, major banks are not hesitating due to technical limitations or lack of interest, but because they are waiting for formal rules that allow them to engage fully with digital assets. The argument centers on the idea that financial institutions have spent years preparing their infrastructure behind the scenes. Once legislation governing market structure is finalized, X Finance Bull suggests that these institutions will move quickly to announce their participation, including the use of XRP for liquidity and settlement purposes. In his view, this shift would fundamentally change how early and late market participants are defined.

Institutions that… pic.twitter.com/ROopRj21vW — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) January 22, 2026 Banks Positioned Ahead of Market Structure Approval X Finance Bull emphasizes that banks are already positioned for entry, rather than evaluating whether to enter at all. He frames the current period as a pause rather than a rejection, driven by compliance requirements and regulatory uncertainty. From this perspective, the passage of market structure rules is not an abstract policy issue but a practical green light for institutions that have been waiting for legal certainty. This interpretation aligns with recent public commentary from policymakers and advisors close to the White House. In a CNBC interview referenced alongside the post, White House crypto and AI advisor David Sacks indicated that once market structure legislation is in place, banks are expected to integrate into the crypto industry rather than operate in a separate or parallel system. X Finance Bull presents this as confirmation that institutional entry is anticipated at the highest levels of policy discussion. Ripple Infrastructure and XRP Liquidity Highlighted Another central point in the commentary is the distinction between infrastructure readiness and market participation. X Finance Bull states that Ripple already has the necessary technology stack in place, while XRP provides the liquidity component needed for institutional-scale transactions. From his perspective, the payment rails are complete, removing operational barriers that might otherwise delay adoption once regulatory approval is secured. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He further argues that this readiness places XRP in a unique position compared to other digital assets that may still be developing or testing their institutional use cases. The expectation is that once rules are finalized, institutions that have remained quiet over the past several years will publicly confirm both purchases and active usage of XRP. Long-Term Conviction Over Short-Term Volatility X Finance Bull also contrasts long-term research-driven conviction with short-term market reactions. He presents the recent selling pressure as inconsistent with the broader institutional narrative he describes, questioning the rationale behind investors’ decision to abandon positions when banks are preparing to increase their exposure. According to his evaluation, the upcoming regulatory decisions will reset market perception, redefining who can be deemed an early adopter of the asset. In general, the commentary asserts that the regulatory market structure is the critical action that could transform years of preparation into tangible demand for XRP. Banks are well-positioned to make a decisive move once the legal structure is established. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

This legislative move specifically targets potential conflicts of interest for President Donald Trump and other high-ranking officials. Consequently, the proposal marks a pivotal moment in the intersection of digital finance and government ethics. Presidential Crypto Ban Proposal Emerges in Senate Committee The Senate Agriculture Committee will soon discuss the proposed amendment to the CLARITY bill. This provision would prohibit the president, vice president, and all members of Congress from conducting financial transactions using digital assets. The Block first reported this development ahead of scheduled committee deliberations. Meanwhile, Bloomberg previously estimated that President Trump earned approximately $1.4 billion from crypto-related ventures. These ventures notably include the stablecoin initiative World Liberty Financial. This legislative action follows increasing scrutiny of political figures’ cryptocurrency holdings. Government ethics experts have repeatedly warned about potential conflicts. The proposed ban represents a direct response to these growing concerns. Furthermore, it establishes a clear precedent for regulating officials’ financial activities in emerging digital markets. Historical Context of Cryptocurrency Regulation in Politics Political involvement with digital assets has evolved significantly over the past decade. Initially, few regulations addressed cryptocurrency holdings for elected officials. However, several high-profile cases prompted congressional attention. For instance, former officials faced criticism for promoting specific tokens. Additionally, some lawmakers reported substantial crypto investments in financial disclosures. The current proposal builds upon existing financial ethics laws. The STOCK Act of 2012 already restricts traditional securities trading. Nevertheless, digital assets remained largely unaddressed until now. The table below illustrates key regulatory milestones: Year Regulatory Action Impact on Digital Assets 2012 STOCK Act Passage Restricted stock trading; excluded cryptocurrencies 2021 First Crypto Disclosure Rules Required reporting of digital asset holdings 2023 SEC Enforcement Actions Targeted celebrity endorsements of tokens 2025 CLARITY Bill Proposal Seeks complete transaction ban for officials This legislative timeline demonstrates the gradual regulatory approach. Each step addressed emerging concerns about market manipulation and conflicts. The current proposal represents the most restrictive measure yet considered. Expert Analysis of the Proposed Restrictions Financial ethics specialists have offered mixed reactions to the proposed ban. Dr. Eleanor Vance, a government ethics professor at Georgetown University, explained the rationale. “Public officials must avoid even the appearance of impropriety,” she stated. “Cryptocurrency markets present unique challenges because of their volatility and transparency issues.” Conversely, some blockchain advocates criticize the approach. Michael Chen, director of the Digital Governance Institute, expressed concerns. “Blanket bans may discourage technological understanding among policymakers,” Chen argued. “Instead, we need transparent disclosure systems and clear guidelines.” The proposal includes several key provisions: Complete transaction prohibition for president, vice president, and Congress members Coverage of all digital assets including cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and tokens Immediate implementation upon bill passage with no grandfathering Enforcement through existing ethics committees with standard penalty structures Market and Political Implications of the Crypto Ban The proposed legislation could significantly impact both cryptocurrency markets and political dynamics. Market analysts note potential effects on investor confidence. Some experts suggest restrictions might reduce perceived political manipulation risks. However, others warn about creating a two-tier system separating officials from constituents. Politically, the proposal has generated partisan reactions. Democratic supporters emphasize ethical governance and public trust. Republican critics describe the measure as politically motivated. They particularly question its timing amid election cycles. Nevertheless, bipartisan support exists for some form of regulation. International observers also monitor these developments closely. Several governments consider similar restrictions for their officials. The U.S. proposal could establish a global precedent. Consequently, foreign legislative bodies might adopt comparable measures. Constitutional and Legal Considerations Legal scholars debate the proposal’s constitutional dimensions. Some question whether Congress can restrict the president’s personal financial activities. However, precedent exists for such limitations. Historical ethics laws have consistently applied to all government branches. The Supreme Court has previously upheld reasonable restrictions on officials’ conduct. These restrictions aim to prevent conflicts and maintain public confidence. Therefore, legal experts generally expect the proposal to withstand constitutional challenges. Still, specific implementation details might face judicial scrutiny. Conclusion The proposed presidential crypto ban represents a landmark moment in digital asset regulation. Senate Democrats seek to address genuine ethical concerns through the CLARITY bill amendment. This initiative responds to substantial cryptocurrency earnings reported by political figures. Moreover, it establishes clear boundaries for officials’ participation in emerging financial markets. The coming Senate Agriculture Committee discussions will determine the proposal’s fate. Regardless of outcome, this debate highlights growing recognition of cryptocurrency’s political dimensions. Ultimately, the presidential crypto ban discussion reflects broader efforts to modernize government ethics for the digital age. FAQs Q1: What exactly does the proposed presidential crypto ban prohibit? The amendment would prohibit the president, vice president, and members of Congress from conducting any financial transactions using digital assets, including buying, selling, or trading cryptocurrencies and tokens. Q2: Why are Democrats proposing this ban now? The proposal follows reports estimating substantial cryptocurrency earnings by political figures and aims to address potential conflicts of interest before they affect policy decisions or market stability. Q3: How would this ban be enforced if passed? Existing congressional ethics committees and executive branch oversight bodies would enforce the prohibition using standard penalty structures already established for other financial ethics violations. Q4: Does this ban apply to cryptocurrency holdings acquired before the law? The current proposal includes no grandfathering provisions, meaning officials would need to divest existing cryptocurrency holdings or place them in blind trusts upon the law’s implementation. Q5: How have cryptocurrency markets reacted to this proposal? Initial market reactions have been muted, as most analysts expected some form of political regulation, though specific price movements may follow congressional committee discussions and voting.

This venture, headquartered in Paris, represents a pivotal and ambitious shift in AI research, moving beyond language models toward systems that genuinely comprehend and interact with the physical world. The announcement, confirmed in October 2025, signals a new chapter for European tech and the future of machine intelligence. Decoding AMI Labs and the World Model Vision AMI Labs, standing for Advanced Machine Intelligence, has formally disclosed its mission to develop ‘world models.’ Consequently, this approach aims to create AI systems with a robust, persistent understanding of real-world physics, cause and effect, and common sense. Unlike large language models (LLMs) that process text, world models seek to emulate how humans and animals learn through observation and interaction. Therefore, this research direction tackles core limitations of current AI, such as hallucinations and a lack of true reasoning. Yann LeCun, the company’s executive chairman, has been a vocal critic of relying solely on LLMs for artificial general intelligence. He argues that real intelligence starts with perceiving the world, not with language. Accordingly, AMI’s technology promises AI with persistent memory, advanced planning capabilities, and enhanced safety and controllability. This focus makes it particularly suited for high-stakes applications where reliability is non-negotiable. The Leadership and Strategic Backing Behind the Startup A critical detail in AMI’s structure is its leadership team. While LeCun provides the visionary research direction, Alex LeBrun serves as CEO. LeBrun previously co-founded and led Nabla, a health AI startup. His transition was part of a strategic partnership where Nabla gained privileged access to AMI’s world models. Furthermore, Laurent Solly, former Meta Vice President for Europe, has also joined the venture. This team combines deep AI research expertise with seasoned entrepreneurial and operational experience. Investor interest has been intense, reflecting the high stakes of this technological race. Reports from Bloomberg indicate that venture capital firms like Cathay Innovation, Greycroft, and Hiro Capital are in talks. Other potential backers include 20VC, Bpifrance, Daphni, and HV Capital. The rumored $3.5 billion pre-launch valuation underscores the market’s belief in LeCun’s thesis and the team’s ability to execute it. A Contrarian Bet in a Crowded AI Landscape AMI Labs enters a competitive field but with a distinctly different philosophy. Its direct rival, World Labs, founded by AI pioneer Fei-Fei Li, recently achieved unicorn status and is reportedly seeking a $5 billion valuation after launching its 3D world-generating product, Marble. However, AMI’s strategy is not merely to generate digital worlds but to build models that understand and reason about the real one. This foundational research could underpin advancements in numerous applied fields. LeCun has suggested that Meta, his former employer, could become AMI’s first client. This potential collaboration highlights the ongoing exchange between foundational academic research and large-scale industrial application. Despite this, LeCun has maintained his academic role at NYU, ensuring a continued pipeline of talent and open research contributions through publications and open-source releases. Paris as the New Global AI Epicenter The choice of Paris for AMI Labs’ headquarters is a significant geopolitical and technological statement. French President Emmanuel Macron publicly welcomed the decision, pledging government support. This move consolidates Paris’s position as a leading AI hub, joining other notable entities like H, Mistral AI, and Meta’s own FAIR lab. The startup will also maintain offices in Montreal, New York, and Singapore, reflecting its global ambitions from inception. This development is a major boost for the European tech ecosystem. It demonstrates the region’s capacity to attract and retain top-tier AI talent and command valuations competitive with Silicon Valley. The presence of such a high-profile research-driven company could catalyze further investment, startup formation, and policy focus within the EU’s digital strategy. Target Industries and the Path to Application AMI Labs has identified several critical sectors for its technology. Unsurprisingly, healthcare is a primary target, given CEO Alex LeBrun’s background at Nabla. In clinical settings, reliable, non-hallucinatory AI could revolutionize diagnostics, treatment planning, and patient monitoring. Beyond healthcare, the startup’s mission statement highlights industrial process control, automation, robotics, and wearable devices. The company plans to license its world model technology to industry partners for real-world applications. This B2B model allows AMI to focus on core research while ensuring its work solves concrete problems. The emphasis on safety and controllability is not just a technical feature but a prerequisite for adoption in these sensitive, high-liability domains. Conclusion Yann LeCun’s AMI Labs represents a fundamental and thrilling pivot in artificial intelligence. By championing world models over pure language models, the startup is betting on a more robust, reliable, and ultimately more intelligent path to AI. Backed by a stellar team, significant investor interest, and the support of the French government, AMI Labs is poised to become a central player in shaping the next decade of AI. Its success or failure will not only validate a key research direction but also signal Europe’s enduring role in defining the future of global technology. FAQs Q1: What are ‘world models’ in AI? A1: World models are AI systems designed to understand and simulate the rules, physics, and cause-and-effect relationships of the real world. They aim to give AI common sense and the ability to plan and reason based on a persistent internal model of reality, moving beyond pattern recognition in text or images. Q2: Why did Yann LeCun leave Meta to start AMI Labs? A2: While maintaining ties, LeCun left to pursue his specific research vision for ‘world models’ independently. He has expressed criticism of an over-reliance on LLMs and sought to build a company dedicated to his alternative architectural approach for achieving more reliable and capable machine intelligence. Q3: Who is funding AMI Labs? A3: While not officially closed, reports indicate venture capital firms like Cathay Innovation, Greycroft, and Hiro Capital are in advanced talks. The startup is rumored to be seeking funding at a valuation of approximately $3.5 billion, highlighting massive investor confidence. Q4: What is the difference between AMI Labs and World Labs? A4: Both focus on world models, but with different emphases. World Labs, founded by Fei-Fei Li, has launched a product (Marble) for generating 3D environments. AMI Labs, led by LeCun, is focused on foundational research to build general-purpose models that understand real-world physics for applications in healthcare, robotics, and industry. Q5: How will AMI Labs’ technology be used? A5: The company plans to license its world model technology to partners in sectors where AI reliability is critical. Primary target fields include healthcare for clinical decision support, industrial automation for process control, robotics for complex task planning, and next-generation wearable devices.

57423978,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=901181,1769214734,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/57423978.jpeg,Remittances take priority over aid as Africa turns to stablecoins,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/africa-turns-to-stablecoins/,"Stablecoins have emerged quickly as a faster and cheaper tool for sending money across Africa, with remittances now considered “more important than aid,” former UN under-secretary-general Vera Songwe says. On Thursday, at a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Songwe emphasized the steep cost of traditional money transfers in the continent, which can reach roughly $6 for every $100 sent, slowing cross-border payments and making them very costly. “Stablecoins are lowering fees and settlement times, allowing people and small businesses to transfer money in minutes, not days,” she said. Songwe also emphasized the financial security that stablecoins can offer in countries struggling with high inflation . Since the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation has exceeded 20% in “about 12 to 15 countries” across Africa, she noted. With 650 million people on the continent lacking access to a bank account, stablecoins allow users with just a smartphone to save in currencies less vulnerable to inflation. According to Songwe, stablecoin adoption is strongest in Egypt, Nigeria, Ethiopia, and South Africa, where inflation is high or capital controls are strict. Most transactions are conducted by small- and medium-sized enterprises, showing that stablecoins are increasingly functioning as a tool for broad financial inclusion. Songwe chairs the Liquidity and Sustainability Facility and is a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. She previously served as executive secretary of the UN Economic Commission for Africa. Stablecoins drive Africa’s digital finance revolution For a while, Africa has been touted as the region that benefits most from digital assets and blockchain technology. However, activity in the region has been the lowest globally, and blockchain adoption has also failed to blow up as expected. This is now changing, and stablecoins are at the forefront of this transformation. Africans prioritize utility over speculation, and now, with stablecoins, payments, hedging against local currency depreciation, and cross-border transfers are easier and faster than ever. Recent reports revealed that Africa leads the stablecoin sector with a 9.3% adoption rate. The report ranked Nigeria first globally, with 25.9 million users, representing 12% of the population. “Stablecoins have become an increasingly critical tool for Africans seeking more efficient and accessible financial solutions,” the report stated. Africa’s embrace of stablecoins didn’t happen overnight; it’s been building over the past few years. With the value of most local currencies depreciating—the naira, for instance, has lost 73% of its value against the USD over the past three years—Africans have turned to stablecoins as a hedge. Millions more have been using stablecoins to send and receive funds from overseas. Crypto adoption accelerates across Africa Crypto adoption is accelerating across Africa, with national responses increasingly diverging. Sub-Saharan Africa saw more than $205 billion in on-chain transactions between July 2024 and June 2025, a 52% year-over-year increase, ranking it third globally, according to a Chainalysis report. Some countries are beginning to embrace regulation: In December, Ghana legalized cryptocurrency trading with the passage of the Virtual Asset Service Providers bill, empowering authorities with risk management measures while facilitating crypto activity. Nigeria enacted rules on January 13 that compel crypto providers to match transactions to users’ tax identification numbers, ushering digital asset activity into the formal tax system. South Africa has also pointed out crypto assets and stablecoins as rising financial stability risks, even as local adoption continues to expand. As the continent’s crypto landscape evolves, stablecoins look ideally positioned to play a key role in enhancing financial inclusion and accelerating payments, offering a hedge against volatile local currencies.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, a widely monitored barometer of investor psychology, has inched upward to a score of 25. Despite this minor gain, the index firmly remains in the “Extreme Fear” territory, highlighting the persistent anxiety clouding digital asset investments. This reading, recorded on April 10, 2025, follows a period of significant market turbulence and regulatory scrutiny worldwide. Decoding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Score of 25 The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a crucial thermometer for market emotion. Developed by data provider Alternative, it quantifies sentiment on a scale from 0 to 100. A score of 0 represents maximum fear, while 100 signifies unbridled greed. The current score of 25, though a one-point improvement from the previous day, sits deep within the red zone defined as “Extreme Fear.” This metric is not a simple survey; it is a composite index derived from multiple market data points. The calculation incorporates six core components, each weighted to reflect its influence on overall sentiment. Volatility (25%): Measures price swings, with high volatility often correlating with fear. Market Volume (25%): Analyzes trading activity; suppressed volume can indicate investor hesitation. Social Media (15%): Tracks sentiment and volume of discussion on platforms like Twitter and Reddit. Surveys (15%): Incorporates data from periodic polls of market participants. Dominance (10%): Assesses Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. Trends (10%): Evaluates search interest via platforms like Google Trends. Therefore, the index provides a multi-faceted, data-driven snapshot of collective market psychology. Historical Context and Market Impact of Extreme Fear Understanding the significance of a score of 25 requires examining historical patterns. The index has fluctuated dramatically since its inception. For instance, it plummeted to single digits during the market capitulation events of late 2022. Conversely, it soared above 80 during the bull market peaks of 2021. Periods of “Extreme Fear” have historically presented complex dynamics for investors. On one hand, they often coincide with market bottoms or consolidation phases, potentially signaling a buying opportunity for contrarian investors. On the other hand, prolonged fear can lead to reduced liquidity, suppressed asset prices, and a general slowdown in ecosystem development and investment. Recent Crypto Fear & Greed Index Milestones Date Index Score Sentiment Key Market Event Nov 2021 84 Extreme Greed Bitcoin All-Time High (~$69,000) Jun 2022 6 Extreme Fear Terra/LUNA Collapse Aftermath Jan 2023 31 Fear Market Recovery Begins Apr 2025 25 Extreme Fear Current Reading Market analysts frequently compare current readings to these historical benchmarks to gauge relative sentiment. Expert Analysis on the Current Sentiment Landscape Financial analysts point to several concurrent factors sustaining the extreme fear sentiment. Firstly, macroeconomic uncertainty regarding interest rates and inflation continues to pressure risk assets globally. Secondly, the regulatory environment for digital assets remains in flux across major economies like the United States and the European Union, creating hesitation among institutional investors. Thirdly, on-chain data shows a reduction in active addresses and network activity for several major blockchains, indicating lower retail participation. Experts from firms like Glassnode and CoinMetrics often correlate these on-chain metrics with sentiment index readings to build a more complete picture. They note that while fear dominates, the slight uptick to 25 could suggest the initial phase of panic selling has subsided, potentially giving way to a period of cautious accumulation or sideways movement. The Role of Bitcoin Dominance in Sentiment Calculation Bitcoin’s market cap dominance, accounting for 10% of the index, plays a pivotal role. Currently, a high dominance figure often reflects a “flight to safety” within crypto, where investors move capital from altcoins into Bitcoin, perceived as a more established store of value during turmoil. This behavior directly feeds into the fear metric. Conversely, when dominance falls and altcoins gain market share, it typically signals higher risk appetite and greed. The interplay between Bitcoin’s price stability, its dominance ratio, and the broader index score is a critical relationship for traders to monitor. Recent data shows dominance holding at elevated levels, reinforcing the risk-off narrative captured by the Extreme Fear reading. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading of 25 offers a clear, quantitative measure of the prevailing market mood. It confirms that despite a marginal daily improvement, extreme fear continues to govern cryptocurrency investor sentiment. This environment, shaped by macro pressures, regulatory developments, and technical market factors, presents both challenges and opportunities. Historically, such periods have preceded significant market inflection points. For market participants, this index serves as a vital tool for contextualizing price action within the broader spectrum of human emotion and market structure, reminding everyone that data-driven analysis is crucial in navigating the volatile crypto landscape. FAQs Q1: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 25 mean? It indicates the market is in a state of “Extreme Fear.” The scale runs from 0 (maximum fear) to 100 (maximum greed), placing 25 deep within the fear zone, suggesting high investor anxiety and risk aversion. Q2: Who creates the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and how is it calculated? Data provider Alternative.me calculates the index. It uses six weighted factors: volatility (25%), trading volume (25%), social media (15%), surveys (15%), Bitcoin dominance (10%), and search trends (10%). Q3: Is extreme fear always bad for cryptocurrency investors? Not necessarily. While it indicates negative sentiment and often lower prices, extreme fear has historically sometimes marked potential buying opportunities for long-term investors, as prices may be undervalued relative to future potential. Q4: How often does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index update? The index updates daily, providing a near real-time snapshot of shifting market sentiment based on the previous 24 hours of data. Q5: Can the index predict future Bitcoin or crypto prices? The index is a sentiment indicator, not a direct price predictor. It shows current market emotion, which can be a contrarian signal at extremes. However, prices are influenced by many other fundamental and technical factors beyond sentiment alone.

The watchdog dropped the case against the company. This move ended one of the most closely watched crypto enforcement cases, which emerged from the 2022 market collapse. In a joint filing submitted on Friday, the SEC and Gemini asked a federal court to dismiss the case with prejudice. This means that the agency cannot bring the same claims again. The long-running case had been pending since January 2023. It also marks the closure of another major legal battle over the digital assets industry under the Trump rule. Gemini is run by twin founders Tyler Winklevoss and Cameron Winklevoss. SEC ends Gemini Earn case but warns others According to the release, the SEC stated that its decision was an exercise of discretion. It cited the 100 percent in-kind return of crypto assets to Gemini Earn customers. However, it also pointed to prior state and regulatory settlements tied to the program. Meanwhile, the agency suggested that this dismissal does not send any sort of shift in enforcement policy. The filing said the decision does not reflect the SEC’s position in other cases. This involves crypto lending or yield products. The Gemini Earn program was launched in February 2021. It granted users to earn yield by lending crypto assets to Genesis Global Capital. Gemini was acting as the front end and charged fees from users. Later, Genesis froze withdrawals in November 2022. This move followed the collapse of FTX which triggered a massive liquidity crisis in the crypto market. Under Gemini Earn, customers lent bitcoin and other tokens to Genesis . In return, they received interest payments where Gemini earned fees that reached as high as 4.29%. Gemini has said customers were informed of risks. It has maintained that Genesis was responsible for the lending decisions and losses. Genesis said it could not meet redemption requests. This resulted in more than $900 million in customer assets being locked at the time. Around 340,000 Gemini Earn users were affected due to the halt. However, Genesis filed for bankruptcy two months later. Genesis settlement The SEC came into action and sued Gemini and Genesis in January 2023. The agency alleged the companies sold unregistered securities to retail investors. It argued that Gemini Earn functioned as an investment contract under federal law. Gemini denied the allegations and said that Earn was a lending arrangement and not a securities offering. However, Genesis did not contest the facts but later reached a separate settlement. Genesis reportedly agreed to pay a $21 million civil penalty. It did so without admitting or denying wrongdoing. The settlement between the SEC and Gemini did not resolved the claims. Both parties showed some progress in September 2025. The agency agreed in principle to settle the case. Lawyers for both sides said the agreement would fully resolve the dispute, subject to commission approval. The settlement disclosure in the case came days after Gemini completed an initial public offering. The exchange raised $425 million and the IPO valued the company at about $3.3 billion. After months of negotiations, Gemini Earn customers eventually recovered their assets. The recovery was completed in kind rather than in cash. That outcome weighed heavily in the SEC’s decision to dismiss the case.

However, the margin for error is thin. As price hovers near key levels, $63 has emerged as the line bulls must protect. A break below it could shift momentum sharply, while holding above keeps the broader bullish structure alive and sets the stage for the next decisive move. Structure Gives Way, Expansion Phase Begins Columbus’s latest LTC update highlights that the multi-year compression that previously capped price action has finally resolved, resulting in a clean break of the long-term chart setup. This structural change confirms a shift from a neutral state to a clearly bullish one. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Litecoin Price May Be Getting Ready For Another Massive Rally The current price action is described as a pause before expansion rather than the conclusion of the rally. In this phase, Litecoin is holding steady above old resistance levels, allowing the market to load for the next leg of the move, turning previous barriers into new support. Litecoin’s projected path forward is based on the typical behavior of expansion cycles following structural breaks. The strategy follows a clear three-step progression: the initial breakout, followed by the current phase of acceptance. Once the market fully accepts these new price levels, the “real move” begins, representing a phase where the most significant gains are expected to materialize. The 9-Year Trendline That Still Controls Litecoin Matthew Dixon highlighted the immense historical significance of the Litecoin long-term trend line. This line has acted as an unbreakable floor for nine years, with the price never closing below it. While the market has dipped under this line multiple times in the past, every attempt to break down has ultimately failed, maintaining a remarkably consistent structural defense. Related Reading: Litecoin Follows Bitcoin’s Momentum, But Resistance Looms At $79.60 Currently, the market environment is putting this nearly decade-long support to the test once again. Dixon emphasizes that we cannot rely on intra-month volatility to determine the outcome. Instead, the definitive signal rests solely on the monthly candle close. This closing price will serve as a macro-economic pivot point that dictates the primary direction for the coming months. A successful hold above the trend line would be a powerful bullish confirmation, suggesting the long-term uptrend remains intact despite external pressures. Conversely, a confirmed close below this line would shift the narrative to bearish, marking a historic breakdown of a nine-year support system. Specific technical triggers are also in play, particularly the $63 level. Dixon warns that falling below $63 would be devastating, as it would effectively nullify the hidden bullish divergence currently supporting the price. Given these risks, Dixon recommends exercising patience until the monthly close or ensuring strict stop losses are in place for any active trades.

Trading kicked off amid a mix of curiosity and caution, with on-chain data already showing how much the DOGE ETF has performed so far. 21Shares Launches Dogecoin ETF In a press release on Thursday, January 22, 21Shares announced the official launch of its Spot Dogecoin ETF, TDOG, which began trading on NASDAQ the same day. The new ETF provides investors with direct exposure to Dogecoin through a fully backed, regulated, and transparent vehicle. Each ETF share is also backed 1:1 by DOGE held in institutional-grade custody. Notably, the launch of the new TDOG ETF brings the total number of US Dogecoin ETFs to three, joining Grayscale’s GDOG and Bitwise’s BWOW. 21Shares is also the only ETF provider endorsed by House of Doge , the official corporate arm of the Dogecoin foundation, highlighting the global asset manager’s close ties to the meme coin. As one of the largest crypto ETF issuers, 21Shares continues to expand its crypto product lineup with the introduction of TDOG. This follows the investment company’s previous ETF offerings, including TSOL, a Solana ETF released in November 2025; ARKB, a Spot Bitcoin ETF launched in January 2024; and TETH, an Ethereum ETF introduced in July of the same year. Together, these products demonstrate 21Shares’ commitment to providing institutional-grade access to high-demand digital assets. Federick Brokate, Global Head of Business Development at 21Shares, highlighted DOGE’s large and active global community, calling it a unique digital asset with constantly growing use cases. He added that the new TDOG ETF will give investors regulated, physically backed exposure through a familiar ETF structure they know and trust. Marco Margiotta, the CEO of House of Doge , also shared comments on the recently launched 21Shares ETF. He said that TDOG is a step toward making Dogecoin easier to access through traditional financial systems. He also disclosed that House of Doge’s partnership with 21Shares will help more people get involved as the Dogecoin ecosystem grows. How 21Shares Dogecoin ETF Has Performed So Far Contrary to expectations, 21Shares’ recently launched Dogecoin ETF saw weak performance on the first day of trading, signaling investors’ lack of interest in the investment product . Data from SoSoValue shows that TDOG experienced no inflows on January 22 and instead declined by about 0.07%. Despite it being the second day of trading, the DOGE ETF has still not registered any flows. This lackluster performance has been observed across all Dogecoin ETFs this week. Grayscales’ GDOG and Bitwise BWOW have reported zero inflows over the last week. The last time GDOG saw positive activity was on January 8, when it received around $333,083 in investments. Before that, the ETF recorded its highest inflows on January 2, totaling roughly $2.3 million. Since its launch in November 2025, GDOG ETF inflows have been unstable, with more days of inactivity than significant investment.",Dogecoin|21Shares|ARKB|Bitwise|BWOW|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin Ecosystem|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Federick Brokate|GDOG|Grayscales|House of Doge|Marco Margiotta|Nasdaq|Solana Spot ETF|Sosovalue|spot Bitcoin ETF|Spot Dogecoin ETF|Spot Ethereum ETF|TDOG|TETH|TSOL,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SPONSORED|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-24 01:00:34

Court filings show the parties jointly agreed to dismiss the case in the Southern District of New York. The dismissal still requires approval from a federal judge to become final. Once approved, the SEC will be permanently barred from bringing the same claims again. The lawsuit centered on Gemini’s Earn program, which allowed customers to lend crypto assets through Genesis. The SEC had alleged the program involved the sale of unregistered securities. The case was originally filed in January 2023 during a period of aggressive regulatory enforcement against crypto firms. The dismissal marks a significant legal victory for Gemini and the broader crypto industry. It also signals a shift in regulatory priorities under the current administration. Background of the Earn Program Gemini Earn allowed customers to earn interest by lending digital assets to Genesis. Genesis then used those assets for institutional lending and trading activities. The program collapsed following Genesis’s bankruptcy in 2022 after major market disruptions. Many investors feared they would never recover their funds. However, the bankruptcy process ultimately resulted in a 100% in-kind return of assets. The SEC cited this recovery as one reason it agreed to dismiss the case. Gemini also committed up to $40 million to support the full repayment of customers. The regulator acknowledged that customer harm had been effectively resolved. Genesis had already settled with the SEC earlier by paying a $21 million fine. That settlement removed Genesis from further litigation risk related to the case. Regulatory Shift Under New Leadership The SEC paused the Gemini lawsuit in April 2024 while Mark Uyeda was serving as acting chairman. The pause suggested the agency was reassessing its broader crypto enforcement strategy. Since the Trump administration took office in January 2025, several crypto cases have been dropped. The administration has publicly promised to reduce regulatory pressure on the digital asset sector. Gemini’s case adds to a growing list of abandoned lawsuits. Other firms benefiting from dismissals include Binance, Kraken, Uniswap, Immutable, and Robinhood. The trend signals a dramatic departure from the aggressive enforcement seen under the prior administration. Regulators now appear more focused on collaboration and clarity rather than punishment. This shift has been welcomed by much of the crypto industry. It has also improved investor confidence across digital asset markets. Impact on the Crypto Industry The dismissal provides reassurance that crypto lending programs may be revisited under clearer legal frameworks. Many companies paused innovation after facing legal uncertainty. With the SEC retreating from several major cases, development may accelerate again. Firms may feel more comfortable launching new financial products. The outcome also highlights the importance of bankruptcy resolution in regulatory negotiations. Returning customer funds played a decisive role in shaping the SEC’s decision. That sets a precedent for how similar cases might be handled in the future. It shows regulators are willing to compromise when investor losses are fully addressed. The case also reinforces the importance of compliance transparency. Crypto firms are expected to work more closely with regulators going forward. Broader Legal Developments The SEC is not the only agency pulling back from crypto litigation. The Department of Justice recently dismissed its NFT insider trading case against Nathaniel Chastain. That decision followed a federal appeals court reversal of his earlier convictions. The outcome further weakens the government’s recent track record in crypto prosecutions. Together, these dismissals indicate a cooling of legal hostilities toward digital assets. They suggest a more balanced regulatory environment may be emerging. For crypto companies, this represents a chance to rebuild trust and credibility. For investors, it offers greater confidence that the market is stabilizing legally. The Gemini dismissal may become a landmark moment in crypto regulation history. It could mark the beginning of a more cooperative era between regulators and innovators.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2026-01-24 01:01:28

According to Arthur, the previous year served a specific purpose for the industry. He argued that 2025 was largely defined by efforts to remove lingering obstacles created by earlier political and regulatory conditions, including unresolved lawsuits, inconsistent oversight, and structural weaknesses in market regulation. In his view, these issues weighed heavily on innovation and limited the ability of serious blockchain networks to operate at full capacity. Arthur’s comments suggest that this period of cleanup was necessary groundwork rather than a growth phase. He emphasized that uncertainty and hostile regulatory approaches had distorted market behavior, allowing speculation to dominate while practical use cases remained underdeveloped. 2026 as the Year of Activation Looking ahead, Arthur described 2026 as a fundamentally different phase for the sector. He characterized the coming year as one in which regulation, functional utility, real adoption, and genuine liquidity begin to align. Under this framework, blockchain networks integrated into financial systems would start to see measurable benefits, while speculative projects would struggle to remain relevant. Arthur argued that once regulation becomes clearer and institutional participation increases, the crypto market will no longer resemble its current form. He expressed the view that a large portion of existing projects, “up to 50%,” could disappear by the end of 2026, not due to controversy or market panic, but because they lack meaningful purpose or real-world application. Utility as the Driver of the Next Cycle Central to Arthur’s outlook is the belief that the next market cycle will be driven by utility rather than hype. He pointed to real-world problem solving, financial infrastructure, and settlement capabilities as the defining characteristics of the networks that will endure. In this context, he identified specific blockchain platforms that he believes are positioned to benefit from this shift, including XRP, Ethereum , Algorand, and HBAR , particularly those already being connected to global systems. Arthur warned that continued exposure to assets with no clear function carries increasing risk as the market matures. He maintained that regulatory clarity combined with operational utility will narrow the field, leaving only technologies that offer tangible value. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community Reaction and Liquidity Expectations The message resonated with some members of the community. One X user, Jalen, publicly agreed with Arthur’s assessment, adding that upcoming legislation could further accelerate liquidity entering the market once it is passed. While Jalen noted that this view was subjective, his comment aligned with Arthur’s broader argument that regulatory progress could unlock capital flows that have remained on the sidelines. Taken together, Arthur’s remarks present a clear thesis: the crypto market is moving away from speculation and toward practical implementation, and the assets that survive will be those built for real financial use rather than short-term narratives.

According to him, this is possible due to the surge in backing for the crypto industry from the United States under the leadership of Donald Trump. Hence, with other nations following this lead, CZ predicted that Bitcoin might evolve beyond its typical four-year cycle. Regarding this four-year cycle, analysts noted that it typically shows an increase in BTC’s price , followed by a drop after each halving event. Notably, being a dominant cryptocurrency in the market, once it moves, the rest of the market typically follows. CZ describes 2026 as a game-changer for Bitcoin’s price trend During an interview with CNBC’s anchor Andrew Ross Sorkin at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Binance’s founder declared that, “I strongly believe that 2026 will likely be a supercycle for Bitcoin.” Although he made this statement firmly, CZ failed to establish a specific price target for the cryptocurrency. On the other hand, other key crypto influencers shaping the industry did set a specific price target for Bitcoin. For instance, Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple, proposed a target of $180,000, while the co-founder of the BitMEX cryptocurrency exchange, Arthur Hayes, suggested a target of $200,000 for this year. Following this news, Zhao acknowledged that, “Looking at a 5-10 year timeframe, it’s quite easy to predict. We’re going to see an increase.” Meanwhile, sources with knowledge of the situation revealed that during Zhao’s talk with anchor Ross Sorkin, the former Binance CEO denied any relationship with Trump regarding crypto activities. Nonetheless, even with his assertion, some in the crypto industry suggest that CZ’s connection to the US president may have played a key role in persuading Trump to issue a pardon for the Binance co-founder last October. “There really isn’t any connection,” Zhao stated. “The only thing is that the Trump family is involved in crypto. Binance is a major crypto company, and the Trump administration supports crypto. That benefits all businesses in the crypto space.” Trump’s decision to pardon CZ raised suspicion among individuals Concerning Zhao’s relationship with Trump, reports highlighted that MGX, an investment firm from Abu Dhabi, allocated around $2 billion of its funds to Binance via the USD1 stablecoin , a fiat-backed, institutional-focused stablecoin issued and managed by the World Liberty Financial (WLFI) decentralized finance platform, backed by Donald Trump and family last year. This finding prompted reporters to reach out to CZ for comment on the alleged relationship. In response to this request, Zhao stressed that it was all a misunderstanding. Based on his argument, MGX is an investor that decided to use USD1 after the Binance co-founder asked them to make payments in crypto, since he disliked working with banks. Additionally, CZ claimed that he had never met or spoken with Trump. The closest he has ever come to the US president, according to his statement, is 30-40 feet, at Davos earlier this week. Afterwards, he expressed his gratitude to Trump concerning his decision to pardon him. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

XRP is one such well-known cryptocurrency, but it also gets affected by the developments that are happening on the regulatory side as well as the global politics that are being formed. Currently, it is below $2.00. Even if it continues with the upward move, the growth might be limited. Investors are now discovering bigger potential in projects such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Although XRP can only anticipate small gains, MUTM will provide a large profit to its holders right from the start. The current presale value of MUTM stands at $0.04. Limited Upside For XRP Recent news for the XRP currency reveals a coin which faces serious issues. The value of the currency fell for the sixth consecutive day, reaching a price of $1.85 due to US-Europe trade tensions. There are also delays in the regulatory overhaul in the crypto markets. Specialists believe that XRP can reach $2.50 or even $3.66 in the near future. Nonetheless, this is quite modest in comparison to the growth that new coins can provide. XRP is an established coin; it has been in existence for quite some time. A growth from $1.85 to $3.66 is quite positive but does not qualify as multiplication of one’s capital. For the best cryptocurrency to invest in at the moment, one would have to look at an early-stage coin rather than one that is affected by political factors. Mutuum Finance Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 7 of its presale, with a price of $0.04 per token. Supply is limited and the availability of tokens is running low. Phase 8 starts at $0.045. The price for the token launch is $0.06 with immediate upside expected, meaning there is at least a 550% profit margin immediately. A higher expected gain is to be found in a later phase as adoption grows. The supply of its tokens is constant; 4 billion. The demand for MUTM will probably also grow with the rising usage of the Mutuum platform. The analysts forecasting the values opine that the prices might reach a point of $1 to $5 following the launch of the token. An initial investment of only $100 may increase to $2,500 according to early forecasts. Safety through Over-Collateralization Loans One of the prominent aspects of Mutuum Finance is the provision of safe loans. The borrowers have to lock collateral that exceeds the loan amount; for instance, a loan of $5,000 requires locking around $7,500 in ETH. It acts as a guarantee against the loan being shut down abruptly because of minor changes in the markets. The above safety framework makes the platform more attractive to users, and thus the platform fees will be higher. As a holder of the MUTM, one will reap the benefits of the rise in the value of the tokens. The above framework makes MUTM a safer and more prudent option compared to many of the new tokens. Earning Rewards through Security Research There are several Mutuum Finance gives a lot of importance to security and has a Bug Bounty Program with a reward budget of $50,000. Bugs discovered in the codes can earn a reward of a maximum of $200 for low-level bugs and a maximum of $2,000 for critical bugs. The emphasis on safety shows the team cares. Greater confidence in investors may translate to increased buying-and-holding in MUTM, which may cause prices to increase. Emphasis on safety is an additional reason to consider MUTM a top investment in the future. Why MUTM Represents a Genuine Opportunity Although XRP might have some gradual increases, its course is not certain in light of government and regulation issues. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), on the other hand, offers a brighter future in terms of a final presale opportunity with a favorable price, a revenue-generating platform, and a development team working for the benefit of its clients. The projected figures show that a small investment will result in a large return. Although XRP is growing gradually, investment in MUTM will enable the achievement of wealth. You should not forget the final step of Phase 7. It is a good investment opportunity for the next big cryptocurrency.

Glassnode Says Watch This",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/can-bitcoin-revisit-97600-glassnode/,"Bitcoin’s push to $97,600 last week drew a burst of bullish options activity, but Glassnode argues the derivatives tape looked more like short-dated positioning than broad-based conviction. In a Jan. 23 thread, the on-chain analytics firm pointed to a split between front-end call demand and longer-dated risk pricing that stayed anchored in downside protection. “Let’s deep dive into options market behavior during last week’s move to 97.6K, and how options metrics help gauge conviction behind the move,” Glassnode wrote. The core takeaway: upside flow showed up, but it didn’t meaningfully change how the market priced risk further out the curve. What Bitcoin Traders Can Learn From Last Week’s Rally Glassnode first focused on near-term skew. Around mid-January, BTC rose roughly 8% over a few days, and the 1-week 25-delta skew moved sharply toward neutral from “deep put territory.” That kind of front-end shift can look like a market flipping bullish—until you check whether the same repricing is happening in longer expiries. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Selling Off On Quantum Fears? A Reality Check “Careful though,” Glassnode warned. “Near-dated call demand is often misread as directional conviction.” The thread paired that point with flow data: the options volume put/call ratio dropped from 1 to 0.4, signaling a surge in call activity. But, as Glassnode framed it, the question is not whether calls were bought, but how short-dated that demand actually was. The longer-dated picture was notably less enthusiastic. Glassnode said the 1-month 25-delta skew “only moved from 7% to 4% at the low,” staying in put asymmetry even as the 1-week skew fell from 8% to 1%. On the 3-month 25-delta skew, the shift was even smaller (less than 1.5%) and it “stayed firmly in put territory,” continuing to price asymmetric downside. For Glassnode, that divergence matters because it separates “flow” from “risk pricing.” Upside participation can be real, but if the market does not reprice skew across maturities, it suggests traders are not extending that optimism into a higher-conviction, longer-horizon view. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Power Shift: New Whales Now Control The Market The volatility tape reinforced the same message. “Layering in ATM implied volatility, we see vol being sold as price moved higher,” Glassnode wrote. “Gamma sellers monetized the rally. This is not the volatility behavior typically associated with sustained breakouts.” That combination: front-end call demand alongside vol supply can align with tactical positioning rather than a regime change. It can also leave spot moves more vulnerable if follow-through buying does not materialize once short-dated structures roll off. Glassnode closed with a checklist for what a cleaner breakout would look like: “An ideal breakout setup combines spot pressing key levels, skew pointing higher with conviction across maturities, and volatility being bid. Last week’s move didn’t meet those conditions.” For traders watching whether BTC can revisit $97,600, the thread’s implication is straightforward: monitor whether longer-dated skew begins to lift out of put territory and whether implied volatility starts to get bid, not sold, as spot tests key levels again. At press time, BTC traded at $89,297.

57425627,658837,1769220058,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57425627.jpeg,$48M Bitcoin Heist: Phishing Scam Empties South Korea’s Seized Crypto,https://bitcoinist.com/48m-bitcoin-heist-phishing-scam-empties-south-koreas-seized-crypto/,"South Korean authorities have come under scrutiny after a large stash of seized Bitcoin went missing during a routine check. The loss was discovered when officials found that some of the wallets that had been held as criminal evidence were empty. According to multiple reports, the value of the missing Bitcoin is about 70 billion won — roughly $47.7–$48 million. How Officials Found The Theft Reports say the gap showed up during a routine audit of confiscated digital assets at the Gwangju District Prosecutors’ Office. An internal check flagged transfers from wallets that had been marked as evidence, and investigators traced the movement back to external addresses. The office immediately opened an inquiry to determine how access was lost and whether any recovery is possible. Initial findings point to a phishing scam as the trigger. According to local coverage, a staff member accessed a fraudulent website that impersonated a legitimate service, and that interaction exposed passwords and private keys. Once the credentials were captured, the Bitcoin was moved out in transactions that cannot be reversed. Security Lapses And USB Storage Reports note that some of the access details for the seized assets were kept on portable drives rather than in hardened custody systems. That practice appears to have made it easier for attackers to grab the keys once the phishing trap was sprung. Simple mistakes can cost millions when the asset is bearer-like and transfers are final. The theft has raised hard questions about how state agencies handle crypto. Some experts say that the tools used by prosecutors were more suited to personal use than to government-level custody. There are calls for stricter rules, multi-signature setups, and cold storage protocols that do not rely on easily copied passwords. Tracing The Bitcoin Blockchain records show the funds moving through several wallets after the initial transfer. That public trail gives investigators leads, but tracing tokens to a final cash-out point is often slow and requires cooperation from foreign exchanges and on-chain analytics firms. Reports say authorities are working with outside specialists to map the flow. What Prosecutors Are Doing Next The Gwangju prosecutors’ office has vowed a full probe, and officials are trying to reconstruct events step by step. There are also signs that the incident will trigger a review of national procedures for holding seized digital property. Some lawmakers and legal experts have already called for clearer standards and oversight.

In 2029, Floki Inu is predicted to reach a maximum price of $0.0001160. FLOKI price can reach a maximum level of $0.0001740 and an average trading price of $0.0001165 in 2032. Floki Inu is a meme coin driven by its community, the Floki Vikings. Inspired by Shiba Inu, Floki Inu aims to democratize power in the crypto space, pivoting the crypto market away from traditional financial entities. The Floki project ecosystem is diverse. It includes Valhalla, a blockchain combat game that rewards players with Floki tokens, and Floki Places, a store for merchandise and NFTs where purchases can be made using Floki tokens. Additionally, Floki University provides educational resources on the cryptocurrency market and blockchain technology. The launch (June 30, 2025) of the Valhalla mainnet of opBNB, coupled with DeFi partnerships like Chainlink, collectively enhances Floki Inu’s value and future potential by driving demand and expanding its use.

Daily structure remains weak below $0.0000450, keeping downside risk alive if $0.0000400 fails. The 4-hour trend remains capped by descending averages, suggesting any bounce is fragile. FLOKI on the daily timeframe On the daily chart for January 24, FLOKI is trading around $0.0000431 after a mild −0.48% session, holding just above the lower Bollinger Band near $0.0000402 while remaining well below the mid-band around $0.0000499. This places the price roughly 13–15% beneath the recent local peak near $0.0000500, confirming the broader pullback phase. The candle structure shows shrinking bodies and reduced downside follow-through, suggesting selling pressure is cooling, but not yet reversing. FLOKIUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD remains negative with the histogram still red, though the bars are contracting, which hints at bearish momentum deceleration rather than a bullish turn. OBV has flattened after a steady decline, signaling that distribution may be pausing, yet there is no clear accumulation to support an upside breakout. A daily close below $0.0000400 would reopen downside risk toward the $0.000037–0.000038 zone, while reclaiming $0.0000450 is needed to relieve immediate bearish structure. FLOKI on the 4-hour timeframe On the 4-hour chart, FLOKI continues to print lower highs beneath the Alligator averages, with price capped around $0.0000437–$0.0000443 and repeatedly rejecting that zone. The recent range low near $0.0000425 has held so far, but each bounce is shallow, reflecting weak dip demand. FLOKIUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The RSI sits around 40–42, below the neutral 50 level, reinforcing that momentum favors sellers, even though it’s far from oversold. From the most recent intraday high near $0.0000450, the price has slipped roughly 4%, and unless $0.0000445 is reclaimed with conviction, upside attempts are likely to remain corrective rather than impulsive.

A sustained hold above $0.0000425 could extend consolidation, but only a reclaim of $0.0000450–$0.0000500 would shift the outlook from defensive to constructive; failure to hold current support risks another leg down. Is Floki Inu a good investment? FLOKI INU could be a big win or a big loss. It’s backed by a strong Floki community and consistent ecosystem developments, which can drive short-and long-term gains. But it’s risky, with price swings and unclear long-term value. Only invest if you’re comfortable with the risk. Will FLOKI reach $0.001? Expert analysis suggests that the $0.001 price point is achievable, provided utility grows and investor interest increases enough to drive FLOKI up ~18.6x its current market cap. Will Floki reach $0.01? FLOKI would need a market cap of up to $95 to $100 billion to hit $0.01, over 95x its current value. Only the top six cryptos have surpassed this level, making it a major challenge without massive growth in adoption and demand. While possible, it’s unlikely in the short term. Does FLOKI have a good long-term future? According to expert analysis, FLOKI has a promising long-term future with consistent growth potential. The coin could reach up to $0.002 within the decade.

After yesterday’s bearish breakdown below $90K, price action has slipped back into indecisive territory, raising fresh questions about whether this pullback is a temporary shakeout or the start of a deeper corrective phase. Related Reading: XRP Distribution Phase Continues, But Funding Rates Suggest Shorts Are Overextended According to top analyst Axel Adler, a macro indicator called Trend Pulse helps explain why momentum has faded. Adler notes that since January 19, the market has remained in Bear Mode, with the Bull phase absent for 83 consecutive days. Two separate charts reinforce this shift, showing that both short-term momentum and quarterly performance have turned negative at the same time. Trend Pulse recently shifted from Neutral to Bear, driven by a double-negative setup: the 14-day return has flipped red, and the SMA30 versus SMA200 trend signal is also negative. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s quarterly return sits at -19%, confirming macro weakness, but without the kind of extreme that often signals a definitive bottom. Bitcoin Remains Stuck In Bear Mode As Macro Signals Stay Negative Adler notes that Bitcoin’s last Bull Mode signal was printed on November 2, 2025, when BTC traded near $110,000—roughly 83 days ago. Since then, the market has failed to regain structural strength. Even the Neutral stretch between December 30 and January 18 proved too short and too weak to restore the long-term trend, leaving Bitcoin vulnerable once selling pressure returned. Adler explains that the first trigger for improvement is the 14-day return moving back above 0, which would shift the regime from Bear to Neutral. However, a full transition back into Bull Mode requires a second condition: SMA30 breaking above SMA200. Given the current divergence between the two averages, that crossover would likely demand 3–4 weeks of sustained upside rather than a short-lived bounce. The Bitcoin Price Performance chart adds macro context by tracking quarterly return (90D) as a sentiment proxy. Historically, readings above +75% align with euphoria, while values below 0% signal pessimism, and drops below -30% reflect capitulation. Bitcoin’s quarterly return sits near -19%, negative but far from deep bear-market extremes. Yet the 7-day change (-6.8%) suggests downside momentum is accelerating after the $90K breakdown. Together, Trend Pulse and quarterly returns point to moderate pessimism without final capitulation, leaving the market at a decision point. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply In Profit Stalls At 71%: Still Not Enough For A Sustainable Recovery BTC Moving Averages Cap Recovery Bitcoin is trading near $89,000 after failing to hold above the $90,000 psychological level, reinforcing the market’s current indecision. The chart shows BTC printing a lower-high structure since the early November peak, followed by a sharp selloff that reset price into a wide consolidation range. After bottoming in late November, Bitcoin rebounded but struggled to build sustained momentum, repeatedly stalling on push attempts toward the mid-$90K zone. From a trend perspective, BTC remains pressured beneath its key moving averages. Price is trading below the green long-term average and the blue mid-term average, both of which are now sloping downward, signaling that broader momentum continues to lean bearish. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Power Shift: New Whales Now Control The Market The most recent rejection occurred as BTC briefly pushed into the $95K–$97K area, only to roll over and break back down toward the range lows. Meanwhile, the red long-term average remains well above price near the low-$100Ks, highlighting how far BTC would need to recover to reestablish a stronger macro uptrend. Volume has picked up on selloffs relative to bounces, suggesting that downside moves are still being met with more urgency. For bulls, reclaiming $90K and then holding above $92K–$94K is key. Otherwise, the chart keeps risk open for a deeper pullback toward the mid-$80K region.

57426876,658805,1769223644,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57426876.jpeg,Institutional-Scale Ethereum Lockup: Bitmine Crosses 1.94M ETH Staked Mark,https://bitcoinist.com/institutional-scale-ethereum-lockup-bitmine-crosses/,"Ethereum has slipped below the critical $3,000 level, adding fresh pressure to a market that is already showing clear signs of hesitation. After weeks of choppy price action, ETH is now entering a more fragile phase where failed recoveries are starting to shift sentiment. With sellers gaining control and bullish momentum fading, several analysts are warning that this breakdown could open the door for a deeper correction if demand does not return quickly. The timing is important. Ethereum is moving through a pivotal zone where short-term price direction could shape the broader narrative for 2026. If ETH continues to trade below $3,000 and lower support levels fail to hold, the market may transition into a prolonged risk-off regime. On the other hand, a fast recovery back above this psychological threshold could signal that the breakdown was only a liquidity sweep, setting up a rebound toward higher resistance. Despite a weakening price structure, on-chain activity suggests large players remain active. Market data shows that Bitmine staked another 171,264 ETH, worth roughly $503.2 million, just a few hours ago. The move adds to the firm’s growing exposure and reinforces the idea that institutional-scale actors are still positioning aggressively, even as Ethereum faces one of its most decisive moments of the year. Bitmine’s ETH Staking Signals Long-Term Conviction Despite Short-Term Weakness According to data from Arkham, Bitmine has now staked a total of 1,943,200 ETH, worth roughly $5.71 billion, marking one of the most aggressive Ethereum accumulation and yield-positioning moves currently visible on-chain. Staking at this scale removes a significant amount of ETH from liquid circulation, effectively shifting supply away from exchanges and into long-term validator positions. In practical terms, it suggests Bitmine is not positioning for a short-term flip, but rather treating Ethereum as a strategic asset that can generate native yield while potentially appreciating over time. This activity stands out because it is happening while Ethereum is under pressure after losing the $3,000 level. At the moment, the market is stuck in a fragile, risk-sensitive phase, where traders are reacting quickly to breakdowns and failed recoveries. Momentum has weakened, liquidity remains thin, and analysts are increasingly warning that a deeper correction could unfold if key supports continue to fail. However, Bitmine’s staking expansion provides a counter-signal: large players appear willing to keep committing capital even as sentiment deteriorates. That divergence highlights the current split in the market—short-term participants are defensive, while longer-term allocators are still building exposure. If price stabilizes, this kind of staking-driven supply reduction can become a structural tailwind. Ethereum Downtrend Pressure Builds Ethereum is trading near $2,940 after losing the key $3,000 psychological level, putting the market back into a fragile position. The chart shows ETH has been trending lower since the October peak, with a clear sequence of lower highs and heavy sell-side volatility that accelerated into November. Although ETH managed to stabilize into a broad consolidation range between roughly $2,850 and $3,250, the most recent breakdown suggests buyers are struggling to defend support when momentum fades. From a trend perspective, Ethereum remains capped beneath its major moving averages. Price is trading below the green long-term average and the blue mid-term average, both of which are sloping downward and acting as dynamic resistance. The recent rebound attempt toward the $3,300–$3,400 zone failed right under the green line, reinforcing that sellers are still controlling rallies. Meanwhile, the red long-term average sits higher near the mid-$3,000s, highlighting that ETH remains far from reclaiming a macro bullish structure. Volume has increased on the sharp red candles compared to the slower grind higher, which often signals distribution rather than healthy accumulation. If ETH cannot reclaim $3,000 quickly, downside risk opens toward the $2,850 range floor. A clean recovery back above $3,150–$3,250 would be needed to reduce bearish pressure and reset the near-term trend.

SEC-CFTC Push Joint Crypto Oversight On Thursday, SEC Chairman Paul Atking and CFTC Chairman Michael Selig announced they will hold an event next week to discuss regulatory harmonization between the two sister agencies. According to the announcement, the pro-industry chairmen will outline the efforts to work together and cooperate to “deliver on President Trump’s promise to make the United States the crypto capital of the world.” The event will be hosted on January 27 at the CFTC headquarters and moderated by crypto journalist Eleanor Terret. Additionally, it will be open to the public and livestreamed on both agencies’ websites. “For too long, market participants have been forced to navigate regulatory boundaries that are unclear in application and misaligned in design, based solely on legacy jurisdictional silos,” said SEC Chair Atkins and CFTC Chair Selig in a joint statement. “This event will build on our broader harmonization efforts to ensure that innovation takes root on American soil, under American law, and in service of American investors, consumers, and economic leadership,” they added. Last year, the SEC and CFTC began discussing their options for effectively collaborating on crypto regulations, as a clear framework for digital assets became a top priority for the agencies As reported by Bitcoinist, the agencies explored reinstating the CFTC-SEC joint advisory committee to develop recommendations on ongoing issues, including efforts in regulatory coordination. During a September joint roundtable between the two agencies, Atking declared that the era of regulatory fragmentation was ending and the age of harmonized, innovation-friendly crypto oversight was here: We are at a crossroads. If we follow the path of our predecessors, America risks ceding leadership in the next chapter of financial history. (…) This ends now (…) our two agencies must work in lockstep to transform dual regulation from a source of confusion into a source of strength. Together, we can offer the best of both worlds: the investor protections that have defined U.S. markets, combined with the innovation-friendly approach that will keep us at the frontier of financial technology throughout the 21st century. The SEC’s Director of the Division of Trading and Markets, Jamie Selway, highlighted the SEC’s efforts to “further harmonize its rules with our sister regulator, the CFTC. In a January 22 speech, He affirmed that the Division will work shoulder-to-shoulder with the CFTC staff to ensure the US’s continued leadership in financial markets, following Atkins’ September directions. Congress Regulatory Efforts Stall The SEC and CFTC’s efforts to regulate the crypto market come as the US Congress struggles to establish a framework to oversee the sector. The Senate Banking Committee’s version of the market structure bill, which focuses on the SEC’s oversight, was delayed after multiple market participants criticized the bill’s draft. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong shared his disappointment with the crypto legislation, withdrawing the company’s support last week. “This version would be materially worse than the current status quo. We’d rather have no bill than a bad bill,” he affirmed. The Senate Agriculture Committee published its version of the CLARITY Act on Thursday, which mainly addresses the CFTC’s role and regulations, scheduling its markup session for January 27. Eleanor Terret shared that the industry’s reaction has been mostly positive, “with stakeholders noting the bill’s close similarities to the House Agriculture Committee’s version of the Clarity Act.” However, recent reports have warned that the Banking Committee’s crypto talks may not resume until later February or early March, as focus shifts to advancing affordable housing plans linked to President Trump’s priorities.",Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|CFTC chairman|CLARITY Act|Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)|Crypto legislation|crypto market structure bill|Michael Selig|SEC Chair Paul Atkins|US Congress|US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)|US Senate Banking Committee,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-24 04:00:03

The coin has risen slightly over the past day, though it remains down for the week. Traders are pointing to familiar chart patterns, suggesting the quiet period may be nearing an end. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Sharp Reversal Leaves Over $800 Million Liquidated In 1 Day Traders Spot A Familiar Price Pattern A fresh take on XRP came from DonWedge, who posted a half-day chart on TradingView. Though he kept it short – just “XRP looks good” – the message carried weight. Instead of bold predictions, his analysis leaned on patterns. A downward-sloping channel draws the eye, much like one seen months before. Shape echoes past rhythm. What stands out is how closely current movement tracks earlier behavior. The image tells part of the story; context fills in the rest. Time will show whether history bends toward repetition. That old rise in XRP moved fast. Following that climb, it slipped into a steady decline lasting around half a year. Once sellers slowed their pace, the price jumped again without warning. $XRP looks good pic.twitter.com/OnyChRVzNp — Don 🐂 (@DonWedge) January 21, 2026 Fresh lows in XRP’s path hug the bottom stretch of a familiar range, pressure easing – some watchful eyes guess what comes next might climb. Volume And Resistance Are Key According to reports, the next major hurdle is a multi-month trendline resistance near $2.10. A clean daily close above this line, combined with rising volume, could signal the start of a new uptrend. DonWedge projects that if the breakout occurs, XRP could aim for $4. From current levels, this would require a little over a 100% increase. Traders note, however, that moves without volume confirmation can fail, leading to false breakouts and extended consolidation. Market Expert Projects A Telling Year Based on reports, analyst ChartNerd says 2026 will be a “telling year” for XRP. He expects the coin either to confirm a strong breakout with fresh momentum or to fall below the structure it has defended for over a year. After a macro breakout in Q4 2024, $XRP has been accumulating above its prior 2021 highs for over a year. The whole of 2025 was sideways, boring, and a test of even the most durable minds. 2026 is going to be the telling year. Compression typically leads to expansion. Buckle up. pic.twitter.com/QJb7JAmIkL — 🇬🇧 ChartNerd 📊 (@ChartNerdTA) January 18, 2026 Lately, the sideways grind has worn thin for some investors – yet hints of resilience still flicker through the numbers. Breaking past $2.10 with force might spark what comes next, lining up with the pattern DonWedge laid out on his chart. Patience now may quietly pay off later. Related Reading: Bitcoin Influencers Get Spotlight In X’s New ‘Starterpacks’ A Breakout Might Shift What Happens Next A sudden jump in price might push XRP toward $4 fast, provided it finishes above the trendline with strong movement. Higher goals are possible, yet reaching them means buyers keep stepping in without pause. So far, things look cautious rather than certain. Traders will probably keep an eye on activity levels, holding back bigger moves until signs become clearer. What happens next might show if XRP surges again or just drifts sideways some more.
