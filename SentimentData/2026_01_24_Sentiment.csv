Coinbase has recently pulled its backing for the CLARITY Act, a proposed framework designed to give U.S. regulators clearer authority over the digital asset sector. As a result, the U.S. Senate Banking Committee has delayed consideration of the bill by several weeks. Even so, broad-based crypto regulation in the U.S. appears unavoidable before year-end. At the same time, Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market has been declining since summer , often interpreted as an early signal that capital is rotating into altcoins such as XRP, Dogecoin, and Pepe ahead of the next major market upswing. XRP (XRP): Payments Blockchain Eyes $5 as Momentum Builds XRP ($XRP) , with a market capitalization of roughly $115 billion, remains the most established crypto in global payments, known for its rapid settlement speeds and low transaction fees. The XRP Ledger (XRPL) was engineered specifically for banks and financial institutions, positioning itself as a modern alternative to slower and costlier legacy networks like SWIFT. Ripple’s growing influence has attracted recognition from high-profile entities, including the UN Capital Development Fund and even the White House, reinforcing XRP’s reputation as a potentially transformative global payments solution. After concluding its long-running legal dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, XRP rallied to a new all-time high of $3.65 in mid-2025. Since then, broader market softness has triggered a pullback of around 48%, leaving the token trading near $1.89. Despite this correction, XRP’s stay below $2 may be short-lived. One of the most significant recent developments has been the approval of spot XRP ETFs in the U.S., opening the door to regulated exposure for both institutional and retail investors. Further ETF launches and improved regulatory clarity could push XRP toward the $5 level by Q2. Dogecoin (DOGE): Will the Doge Army Ever See $1 DOGE? Launched in 2013, Dogecoin ($DOGE) is the first and biggest meme coin, supported by one of the most loyal communities in crypto. What started as a parody now commands a market capitalization of approximately $20.7 billion. DOGE’s explosive rise during the 2021 bull market, fueled by high-profile endorsements from figures like Elon Musk, Snoop Dogg, and Gene Simmons, cemented its place in internet and pop culture history. While its origins are lighthearted, Dogecoin’s scale and liquidity help reduce the extreme volatility seen in smaller meme tokens. As a result, DOGE often trades more in line with major assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP. The slogan “Dogecoin to $1” remains a rallying cry among supporters, but reaching that milestone by 2026 could be difficult without meaningful progress on U.S. crypto regulation. Favorable market conditions could lift DOGE from around $0.14 today to roughly $0.50 by spring. That scenario would place it within striking distance of its 2021 all-time high of $0.7316 during a subsequent bull run. Adoption is also gradually expanding. Tesla accepts DOGE for select merchandise, while payment platforms like PayPal and Revolut now support Dogecoin transactions. Pepe (PEPE): The Iconic Webcomic Became One of Crypto’s Most Copied Coins Since its debut in April 2023, Pepe ($PEPE) has risen rapidly to become the third-largest meme coin, driven by the enduring viral appeal of Matt Furie’s Pepe the Frog character. With a market value near $2.1 billion, PEPE stands as the largest meme coin without a Shiba Inu-themed mascot. Speculation intensified after Elon Musk briefly used a Pepe image as his profile picture on X, sparking debate over his potential investment in the token. PEPE is currently trading around $0.000004914, up 25% over the past month. Despite this rebound, the token remains about 81% below its late-2024 high of $0.00002803, following a subdued summer and a lackluster close to 2025. Its relative strength index is at 44, indicating neutral after some recent panic selling. However, if the bull market hits in Q1, Pepe could easily rise to recapture its previous ATH by the end of the quarter. PEPE surged 69% recently, between December 30 and January 6, highlighting its classic meme-coin behavior, magnifying broader market swings in both directions. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): Meme Branding Meets Advanced Bitcoin Layer 2 Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a new Bitcoin Layer-2 initiative aimed at speeding up transactions, reducing fees, and unlocking advanced smart contract capabilities on the Bitcoin network. Built on the Solana Virtual Machine, Bitcoin Hyper integrates decentralized governance and a Canonical Bridge that enables smooth cross-chain Bitcoin transfers. The project’s presale has already secured more than $30.9 million, with some analysts speculating on potential returns of 10x to 100x once the token lists on exchanges. A recent Coinsult audit found no critical issues within the smart contract. The HYPER token powers the ecosystem, functioning as the unit for transaction fees, governance voting, and staking rewards. Early participants can stake tokens during the presale for yields of up to 38% APY, though rewards decline gradually as more users join. With exchange listings expected later this year, Bitcoin Hyper’s presale offers early exposure to what supporters see as the next phase of Bitcoin’s evolution.

This occurred when hackers reportedly got access to sensitive user information and tried to blackmail the company. The event has brought up new issues regarding the exposure of personal data in the crypto industry, as target fraud and physical attacks against holders are becoming more and more frequent in France. Authorities Link Waltio Breach to Shiny Hunters’ Extortion Attempt In a statement released this week, French cybersecurity institutions confirmed that, via its cybercrime division, the Paris Public Prosecutor’s Office had issued an order to the National Cyber Unit of the Gendarmerie to establish the extent of the breach and identify exposed users. Source: Paris Public Prosecutor’s Office Officials advised that users whose information might have been stolen should be wary of scammers who claim to be genuine service providers or other officials and force them to give up their digital assets using the stolen information. The law enforcement agencies reported that some more recent fraudsters posed as crypto businesses, bank anti-fraud units, or even law enforcement officers and magistrates. French newspaper Le Parisien stated that the attack at Waltio was associated with a ransom demand by a hacking organization called Shiny Hunters. The group purportedly had obtained personal information of approximately 50,000 Waltio users, most of whom reside in France, and said it had samples of the stolen information as proof. Waltio later filed a complaint of attempted extortion and unauthorized access to the automated data system. Waltio said its initial internal assessment showed that the attackers accessed tax reports for the 2024 period. These documents included users’ email addresses, information on crypto profits or losses, and asset balances at the end of the year. The company stated that banking details, administrative records, and tax identification data were not affected and that its core infrastructure was not compromised. Waltio added that its services remain operational and that client funds are not at risk. France Tightens Oversight After Crypto Data Breach Amid Rise in Kidnapping Cases Waltio was founded in France and is headquartered in Clermont-Ferrand. It serves roughly 150,000 users and focuses on simplifying crypto tax compliance for European investors, particularly in France, Spain, and Belgium. The platform aggregates transaction data from more than 700 exchanges, wallets, and blockchains to calculate capital gains, losses, and staking income, and generates tax-compliant reports for local filings. The investigation comes amid heightened scrutiny of crypto-related data leaks in France. In the last year, police have attributed a number of home invasions, kidnappings, and attempted kidnappings to the criminals who intended to use the knowledge of the victims having digital assets. Although the leakage of data has not been directly linked to these crimes , the investigation teams have not eliminated the chances of the data being used to establish potential targets. Masked gunmen steal crypto USB in France as prosecutors reveal tax official sold government database access identifying crypto investors to criminal gangs for 800 euros per operation. #Crypto #Attack #France https://t.co/GmfOkwsE6E — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 9, 2026 Fraud victims have been cautioned to keep evidence, report to the police, and address the data protection authority in France in instances where they feel that their personal data has not been sufficiently safeguarded. The Waltio incident is not the first case of data exposure in the crypto industry in the past. Hardware wallet manufacturer Ledger announced earlier this month that a breach of a third-party payment processor, Global-e, took place, exposing the data of its customers. Last month, crypto tax software developer Koinly also notified users of a potential email data breach related to the use of a third-party analytics platform.

After soaring over 80% in 2025 on turnaround optimism, shares tumbled up to ~17% , when its first‑quarter outlook came in below Wall Street expectations. Management forecasted Q1 revenue around $12.2B, short of the anticipated $12.6B, and guided to breakeven earnings — a stark reminder that execution still lags behind market narratives. This miss occurred even though Intel reported $13.7B in Q4 revenue and $0.15 in non‑GAAP EPS, both beating consensus. Government Positioning and Strategic Stakes Intel’s comeback story isn’t just about chips. The company is a major beneficiary of the CHIPS Act and related federal incentives, positioning the U.S. government as one of its largest shareholders. Recent market moves triggered a multi‑billion‑dollar paper loss for the government after the sell‑off, though its overall position remains profitable with significant gains since its original investment. This intertwines Intel’s fate with geopolitical industrial policy and heightens scrutiny over performance. Whale Activity & Sentiment Signals Large options flows have also begun shaping sentiment. Signals from CheddarFlow reveal a roughly $500M options position on $INTC, interpreted by traders as institutional speculation on a major move in either direction. Such “whale” activity often presages volatility and underscores that heavy hitters see Intel as a strategic play, not just a turnaround narrative. Combined with social commentary from market observers, this activity suggests significant positioning ahead of catalysts like supply improvements or policy shifts. (Insert actual tweet embed here.) Near‑term pain largely stems from supply constraints — executives warn that available supply will hit seasonal lows before climbing later in 2026. These constraints, especially in server CPU and AI data‑center chips, are occurring even as demand accelerates, denting revenue potential and feeding concerns over market share erosion to competitors like AMD and Nvidia. Price Levels to Watch in 2026 Bearish Break: Closing below $44 could trigger a slide to $38–$40 on technical weakness and sentiment pressure. Consolidation Range: $44-$50 if supply improves and execution narratives stabilize. Bullish Rebound: Clearing $50 with strong yield data and major foundry wins, potentially from cloud or AI OEM contracts could reignite upside. Analysts’ bull scenarios have even priced $INTC higher if foundry adoption accelerates beyond expectations. Intel’s near‑term stock forecast blends policy tailwinds, execution risk, and speculative positioning, making it one of the more volatile and story‑rich semiconductor equities in 2026.",News|Reports,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-23 22:47:40

If that happens, altcoins like XRP and Ethereum could explode. Bitcoin is currently trading around $88,000 after getting rejected near the $98,000 level for the second time. Fundamentally, nothing has gone wrong. Bitcoin, XRP, and ETH continue to improve over time. Technically, though, these coins are still in a weak phase. Below is how things could play out for the three as we head into 2026. Bitcoin (BTC) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Bitcoin Price Prediction: What If BTC Just Broke Out? BTC is starting to tighten up inside a squeezing structure, with rising support pushing price into a descending resistance line. It is basically a classic compression setup. The main level to watch is the $96,000–$98,000 resistance zone, which has shut down every bounce so far. A daily close above that area would be a big deal and could open the door for a move toward $102,000, then $105,000. On the downside, rising support from the recent lows in the low $80,000s has held up well, keeping higher lows intact and stopping a deeper breakdown. Momentum is neutral but slowly improving. For now, Bitcoin is stuck in consolidation after the recent drop, and this is a patience game. Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH Holds Support but Lacks Conviction Ethereum spot ETFs continue to record outflows. However, the recent outflows are low compared to past days’ outflows, which is a good sign. ETH spot ETFs recorded $42 million in outflows ETH price is trying to hold its structure after a rough pullback, with price riding along rising support but struggling to break through the $3,400–$3,500 resistance zone. That area has rejected price multiple times, which is why ETH keeps stalling instead of trending higher. As long as the rising support around the high $2,600s to $2,700 zone holds, the bigger structure stays constructive, and this move looks more like consolidation than a full breakdown. A clean break above $3,500 would be the first real sign of strength and could open the door for a push toward $4,300, with $5,000 as the larger upside target. Momentum is still weak but starting to stabilize. RSI needs to push back above 50 to support a stronger bullish move. XRP Price Prediction: XRP Tries to Escape the Downtrend, Is $2.50 Next? XRP is still stuck inside a well-defined descending channel, which explains why rallies keep getting sold into instead of turning into real trend reversals. Price recently bounced from the $1.80 area, which is acting as a key demand zone and the main bullish invalidation level. As long as XRP holds above that level, this bounce remains technically valid, but the structure is still weak overall. The first real test for buyers sits around the $2.40–$2.50 zone, where the price previously broke down and where the upper channel resistance lines up. A clean break and daily hold above that area would be the first sign that momentum is shifting, opening the door for a move toward the $3.00 target zone. Momentum is still mixed. RSI is sitting around 42. Notice something? All three are sitting at the same point waiting for the major move. Holding above $1.80 keeps the bullish scenario alive, while a break below that level would invalidate the setup and likely send XRP back toward lower support Bitcoin Hyper Is Loading While the Market Sleeps With Bitcoin compressing under $100,000, Ethereum stuck below major resistance, and XRP still fighting its downtrend, the market is clearly in a waiting phase. That is usually when attention quietly shifts to projects that do not need a confirmed breakout to start moving. That is where Bitcoin Hyper is starting to stand out. Bitcoin Hyper is being positioned as a high-beta play built specifically for volatility cycles like the one CZ is hinting at. When Bitcoin enters a supercycle, capital does not just flow into majors. It spills into smaller, faster-moving narratives that offer asymmetric upside, especially while the big names are still consolidating. The project has already raised over $ 30.9M , showing strong early conviction even while the broader market remains cautious. On top of that, Bitcoin Hyper offers staking rewards around 39% APY, giving holders an incentive to stay locked in instead of trading short-term noise. Historically, the biggest winners of new cycles are rarely the assets that break out last. They are the ones accumulated quietly while Bitcoin ranges, Ethereum chops, and XRP frustrate traders. Bitcoin Hyper is clearly targeting that window. If Bitcoin really does enter a supercycle in 2026, the projects built and accumulated during this compression phase are often the ones that move first and hardest once momentum returns. Bitcoin Hyper is shaping up to be one of those names traders keep an eye on.

JUST IN: Ripple has renewed its custody partnership with Garanti BBVA Crypto, strengthening institutional access to XRP and expanding its footprint in Turkey. pic.twitter.com/GZcqPPev8m — Crypto Briefing (@Crypto_Briefing) January 23, 2026 The collaboration ensures that Garanti BBVA’s retail customers maintain access to secure custody and transfer services for multiple cryptocurrencies, including XRP , Bitcoin , and Ethereum . Garanti BBVA’s cryptocurrency journey began in late 2024 following a successful pilot program conducted with both Ripple and IBM . The initial phase attracted approximately 14,000 early adopters. This partnership was specifically designed to provide the bank with enterprise-grade key management infrastructure, enabling secure deployment and management of digital asset services. Beyond the Turkish partnership, Ripple has secured another important regulatory milestone. The company recently obtained a “Green Light Letter” from Luxembourg’s Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF), representing preliminary approval for an Electronic Money Institution (EMI) license. While the regulator has completed its legal assessment, final authorization remains pending. This development adds to Ripple’s extensive regulatory portfolio, which now includes over 75 licenses across global jurisdictions. XRP Price Prediction: XRP Forms Rare W-Pattern at $1.95 Support The 4-hour XRP/USDT chart reveals several compelling technical patterns. Price action has been consolidating within a falling wedge formation, a pattern that frequently precedes bullish breakouts rather than continued downtrends. The narrowing range between lower highs and lower lows suggests diminishing selling pressure as the asset approaches a critical decision point. A notable W-pattern has formed near the wedge’s lower boundary, with the $1.88–$1.90 zone demonstrating robust support. Source: TradingView/ Suryapro This repeated defense of key levels indicates strong buying interest at these prices, establishing a potential launching pad for upward movement. Currently trading around $1.95, XRP faces immediate resistance in the $1.98–$2.00 zone, which coincides with the wedge’s upper trendline. A decisive 4-hour close above this critical area would confirm both the falling wedge breakout and the W-pattern reversal signal. If XRP successfully breaks through the $2.00 psychological barrier, analysts anticipate initial upside targets between $2.10 and $2.20. Strong momentum could extend the rally toward the $2.35–$2.40 region , with some optimistic projections suggesting movement toward $2.50. However, traders should remain cautious of potential downside scenarios. A rejection at the $2.00 resistance level, followed by a breakdown below wedge support, could postpone the bullish thesis. Such a development might result in renewed consolidation or a retest of the lower $1.80 range. Beyond XRP: Bitcoin Hyper Raises $30M As First True BTC Layer 2 While XRP attracts attention for its potential breakout, investors are also watching Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a project creating the first authentic Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin using Solana-based technology. The platform combines speed and scalability while maintaining Bitcoin’s security framework. The Bitcoin Hyper presale has already raised over $30 million , demonstrating strong market interest. The project’s Solana-powered Layer 2 infrastructure enables developers to build Bitcoin-native decentralized applications, offering BTC holders new opportunities to utilize their assets through purpose-built on-chain tools. As major wallets and exchanges prepare to integrate this scaling solution, demand for $HYPER is expected to increase rapidly. The token is currently available during the presale phase at $0.013625 . Interested investors can visit the official Bitcoin Hyper website and connect their preferred wallet (such as Best Wallet) to swap USDT or SOL for $HYPER, or purchase directly using a bank card before the next price increase.

Analysts project a possible increase to $3,360. However, these are just small fluctuations for a large cryptocurrency and are encouraging traders to look for even bigger gains elsewhere. Traders are now picking Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the top crypto to buy in 2026. Although there is a steady improvement offered by Ethereum, the presale offered by MUTM is a rare opportunity for significant growth from the very beginning. The low cost associated with it, along with its strong platform, make it the next big opportunity. Ethereum’s Growth Trend Ethereum is a leader in smart contracts and the decentralized finance space, and as such, the price actions have a great effect on the overall market. It did drop down close to $3,170, but it was able to bounce back at around $3,205. Analysts are keeping tabs on whether it could move past the resistance level of $3,360. This is even if it does so, since the percentage increase is not that great for a newcomer. For investors looking for transformative levels of returns, the most attractive investment opportunities can be found in projects before the time of listing on large exchanges. Although the long-term potential of Ethereum is great, its size prevents it from easily achieving the kind of explosive growth associated with a new project such as Mutuum Finance during. Mutuum Finance Presale Advantage Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in the 7th presale phase, and the tokens are only priced at $0.04. This presale phase is filling up fast. Once completed, the presale will move to the 8th phase, priced at $0.045. This is almost a 20% increase. The launch price of the token will be $0.06. This will give stage 7 buyers an instant profit enough to turn a small $500 into $750 before trading begins. However, the actual potential here is much more. With its lending system going into operation, the demand for MUTM may escalate. Analysts who study its model indicate a price range of $2 to $4 after listing on major exchanges. A present investment of $1,000 may potentially escalate to $50,000. Such a prospect makes MUTM one of the top cryptocurrencies for serious investors. Peer-to-Peer Lending for Direct Control Mutuum Finance offers a unique Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending system where users can enter into a lending agreement with each other. Users can choose to lend with an interest rate and a period in mind. For instance, lending 5,000 USDT with an annual interest rate of 12% could result in a passive income of 600 USDT per annum. Another notable aspect is the development of a stablecoin that is pegged to the value of the US dollar. It is created when the user locks in collateral of a higher value in the form of ETH. For example, when a user locks in collateral worth $10,000 in ETH, he/she can create stablecoins worth $7,500. It can then be lent to other people to earn interest in the form of 10% per year. Such a useful ecosystem is a direct demand creator for the MUTM token. Why MUTM is the Clear Growth Opportunity Ethereum seems to have a bright future as an integral part of the DeFi crypto environment. Yet, to ensure exponential growth, new projects with innovative ideas are required. What makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) attractive is not only its affordably priced presale, but it also has an operational platform that provides real yields. This is the key underlying strength that makes analysts recommend MUTM for the year 2026. Do not let the chance to buy at $0.04 slip away. The next price rise is imminent, making it the best time to position yourself in what is considered the best DeFi crypto investment.

57422345,658815,1769209231,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57422345.jpeg,OpenSea Insider Trading Case Ends Without A Retrial – Details,https://bitcoinist.com/opensea-insider-trading-case-ends-without-a-retrial-details/,"Nathaniel Chastain, a former product manager at OpenSea, will not face a retrial after federal prosecutors chose to drop their re-review of his insider trading case. Reports say the US Attorney’s Office reached a deferred prosecution agreement with Chastain that will lead to dismissal of the charges once the agreement runs its course. What Prosecutors Decided Prosecutors told a Manhattan federal court they would not retry Chastain following an appeals court ruling that tossed his earlier conviction. Under the deferred prosecution deal, the government will dismiss the case about a month after notifying the court, and Chastain has agreed to forfeit roughly 15.98 ETH tied to the trades. He has already served three months in prison from his original sentence. How The Appeals Court Changed The Case According to the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, the jury in the first trial had been given the wrong instructions about what the wire fraud law covers. The judges said confidential information only counts as property under the statute when it has commercial value to the employer, and jurors might otherwise convict someone for behavior that is unethical but not criminal. That legal point is at the heart of the reversal. Reports note that prosecutors had called the matter the first-ever insider trading case tied to NFTs. Now, lower courts and enforcement teams will have to think carefully before using traditional fraud laws to police activity in NFT markets. The ruling highlights a gap between old statutes and new kinds of online goods, which may push lawmakers to give clearer rules for how to treat confidential business signals related to crypto platforms. OpenSea: The Case’s Earlier Chapters Chastain was first charged in mid-2022 after prosecutors said he bought certain NFTs before they were featured on OpenSea’s homepage, then sold them after prices rose. He was convicted at trial in 2023 of wire fraud and money laundering and received a sentence that included three months behind bars. The US Attorney’s Office originally described the scheme as a novel use of insider knowledge in digital markets. With the deferred prosecution agreement in place for OpenSea, prosecutors can close this chapter without a new trial. Chastain’s forfeiture of crypto assets and his already served time mean the government has secured some remedy, while the appellate decision leaves open big questions about when private business information can be treated as property for federal fraud charges. Legal teams, judges, and regulators are likely to keep a close eye on how similar cases are handled in the future.

After a brief pullback on January 20, XRP-linked exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have resumed accumulation, adding fresh fuel to bullish XRP price prediction . Data from SoSo Value shows that ETFs brought in $9 million in the past two days. As a result, XRP’s ETF assets stand at $1.37 billion, still surpassing Solana-linked ETF products as Wall Street’s appetite for the top altcoin persists. Ongoing accumulation seems to indicate that whales are aware of something that the rest of the market is ignoring. Is XRP getting ready to make an explosive move? XRP Price Prediction: Descending Triangle Breakout Could Finally Push XRP Above Its 200-Day EMA The price has bounced off the $1.90 support multiple times already, creating a strong floor from which XRP could start running higher. The last rally started after the token broke out of the descending triangle shown in the chart, but faced strong selling pressure at the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA). Source: TradingView A similar setup has formed now, anticipating a potential move from bulls over the next few days if the $1.90 level holds. If that happens, the odds of a bullish breakout above the 200-day EMA will rise. This translates into a short-term target of $2.50, followed by a much stronger move to $3.10 at least. As altcoins regain momentum and prepare for the next major rally, top crypto presales like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) are gaining serious traction. This high-potential project has already raised over $30 million, aiming to bring Solana’s fast speeds and low costs to the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Revamps BTC’s Use Cases by Leveraging Solana’s Power While BTC is a great store of value, it has always been slow and expensive to move – until now. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a crypto presale that brings Solana’s world-class speed to the Bitcoin blockchain. This new layer 2 solution solves the biggest problems Bitcoin has faced by reducing transaction fees to nearly zero and enabling instant asset transfers.

Through this L2, they will finally put their Bitcoin to work by lending, staking, and trading their assets without leaving the security of the Bitcoin network. The crypto community is already moving fast, with over $30 million raised to bring this vision to life. At the heart of this project is the $HYPER token . As adoption grows and more users tap into its fast, low-cost Layer 2 features, demand for $HYPER is expected to rise. If you want to get in early, you can still grab $HYPER at its presale price.

This announcement follows the company’s unprecedented accumulation of 214,400 BTC, valued at approximately $14 billion, establishing MicroStrategy as the world’s largest publicly traded corporate Bitcoin holder. Consequently, the conference represents a pivotal moment for institutional cryptocurrency adoption, potentially influencing how Fortune 500 companies approach digital asset integration. MicroStrategy Bitcoin Conference Details and Strategic Timing MicroStrategy will host its Bitcoin for Corporations 2026 event at a major Las Vegas convention center on February 24-25. The company confirmed this schedule through Michael Saylor’s official X platform announcement. This timing strategically precedes the April 2024 Bitcoin halving event, which historically triggers significant market cycles. Therefore, the conference positions itself at a crucial juncture for corporate financial planning. The event specifically targets corporate executives, treasury managers, and institutional investors. MicroStrategy designed the agenda to address practical implementation challenges. These challenges include accounting standards, regulatory compliance, and security protocols. The company’s extensive experience with Bitcoin acquisition provides real-world case studies for attendees. For instance, MicroStrategy’s quarterly earnings reports now prominently feature Bitcoin holdings as a core asset. Industry analysts immediately recognized the conference’s significance. Bloomberg Intelligence reported increased corporate inquiries about Bitcoin treasury strategies throughout 2024. Similarly, Fidelity Digital Assets noted a 300% year-over-year increase in institutional account openings. These trends suggest growing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrency as a legitimate asset class. Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Trends and Market Context Enterprise Bitcoin adoption has evolved significantly since MicroStrategy’s initial 2020 investment. Initially, companies treated cryptocurrency as a speculative alternative investment. However, the landscape has matured considerably. Today, corporations increasingly view Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset and inflation hedge. This shift reflects changing perceptions about digital currency’s long-term value proposition. Several major corporations have publicly disclosed Bitcoin holdings following MicroStrategy’s lead. Tesla, Square, and Marathon Digital Holdings all allocated portions of their treasuries to cryptocurrency. Additionally, traditional financial institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity have launched Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). These developments created a more robust infrastructure for corporate investment. Company Bitcoin Holdings Initial Investment Date MicroStrategy 214,400 BTC August 2020 Tesla 10,800 BTC February 2021 Block (Square) 8,027 BTC October 2020 Marathon Digital 13,726 BTC Various The regulatory environment continues to evolve alongside these corporate investments. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) implemented new cryptocurrency accounting rules in December 2023. These rules require companies to measure digital assets at fair value. Previously, companies had to report impairment losses regardless of price recovery. This accounting change removed a significant barrier to corporate adoption. Expert Analysis of Corporate Cryptocurrency Strategy Financial analysts emphasize the strategic importance of MicroStrategy’s conference initiative. According to CoinShares’ 2024 Digital Asset Fund Flows Report, institutional investors allocated $2.7 billion to cryptocurrency products in the first quarter alone. This represents a 40% increase compared to the same period in 2023. The data suggests accelerating institutional interest despite market volatility. Industry experts point to several key factors driving corporate Bitcoin adoption: Inflation hedging: Companies seek protection against currency devaluation Portfolio diversification: Bitcoin demonstrates low correlation with traditional assets Technological innovation: Blockchain technology offers potential efficiency gains Competitive positioning: Early adopters gain first-mover advantages in digital finance Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance research indicates that corporate treasury Bitcoin allocations typically range from 1% to 5% of total reserves. However, MicroStrategy’s aggressive approach exceeds these conventional parameters. The company’s Bitcoin holdings now represent over 150% of its market capitalization. This unconventional strategy has generated both admiration and skepticism within financial circles. Conference Agenda and Expected Impact on Enterprise Adoption The Bitcoin for Corporations 2026 conference will feature presentations from multiple industry sectors. Technology companies, financial institutions, and regulatory experts will share practical insights. MicroStrategy’s executive team will detail their operational experience with large-scale Bitcoin acquisition and storage. Furthermore, cybersecurity firms will demonstrate enterprise-grade custody solutions for digital assets. Conference organizers designed the program to address specific corporate concerns. Technical sessions will cover wallet security, transaction procedures, and tax implications. Strategic discussions will explore portfolio allocation models and risk management frameworks. Legal experts will provide updates on evolving regulatory requirements across different jurisdictions. The event’s location in Las Vegas carries symbolic significance. Nevada has emerged as a cryptocurrency-friendly jurisdiction with favorable regulatory policies. The state legislature passed multiple blockchain-related bills in recent sessions. This regulatory environment supports corporate cryptocurrency experimentation and innovation. Industry observers anticipate several potential outcomes from the conference. First, increased corporate Bitcoin adoption could follow as companies gain confidence from peer experiences. Second, standardized best practices might emerge for enterprise cryptocurrency management. Third, regulatory clarity could improve through dialogue between corporations and policymakers. Finally, new financial products and services could develop to meet institutional demand. Conclusion MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin for Corporations 2026 conference represents a strategic inflection point for enterprise cryptocurrency adoption. The event brings together corporate leaders, technologists, and regulators at a critical moment in Bitcoin’s evolution. Michael Saylor’s announcement signals growing institutional confidence in digital assets as legitimate treasury instruments. Consequently, this conference could accelerate mainstream corporate Bitcoin integration. The gathering in Las Vegas will likely produce valuable insights about cryptocurrency’s role in modern corporate finance. Ultimately, the event may establish new standards for how businesses approach digital asset strategy in an increasingly digital economy. FAQs Q1: What is the main purpose of MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin for Corporations conference? The conference aims to educate corporate executives about Bitcoin integration strategies, addressing practical implementation challenges including accounting, security, and regulatory compliance based on MicroStrategy’s extensive experience. Q2: Why is the timing of this conference significant for corporate Bitcoin adoption? The February 2026 timing follows the April 2024 Bitcoin halving event, positioning the conference during a potential market cycle that could influence corporate financial planning and treasury management decisions. Q3: How has corporate Bitcoin adoption evolved since MicroStrategy’s initial investment? Corporate adoption has shifted from speculative investment to treating Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset and inflation hedge, with improved accounting standards and more robust institutional infrastructure supporting this transition. Q4: What regulatory changes have made Bitcoin more attractive to corporations? The Financial Accounting Standards Board implemented new rules in December 2023 allowing companies to measure cryptocurrency at fair value rather than reporting impairment losses, removing a significant accounting barrier to adoption. Q5: What potential impacts could this conference have on broader enterprise cryptocurrency adoption? The conference could accelerate adoption by establishing best practices, improving regulatory clarity through corporate-policymaker dialogue, and developing new institutional-grade financial products and services for digital assets.

The interest in the president’s controversial cryptocurrency has diminished. Investors who bought at the highest prices face large losses due to the steep price drops, increasing criticism of the president’s crypto businesses. Trump’s inauguration hype turns into a 93.4% collapse The Trump coin went live on January 18, 2025. A year later, it’s trading at $4.84, down 93.4% from the highest point. The token dropped steeply after reaching its peak near the US president’s January 2025 inauguration. Before Trump’s January inauguration, the $TRUMP memecoin rose sharply from $1.20 to $73.43, per data from CoinGecko. In late 2023 and early 2024, investors showed intense excitement for memecoins . Anyone online can launch volatile crypto tokens. These tokens lack fundamental value, a business model, or cash flow. They depend on popularity and ties to viral events or famous people to attract speculative interest. A few days following the launch of the $TRUMP coin, Melania Trump introduced her own memecoin. According to aggregated data , the price soared to $13.05 but has since dropped to just under $0.15, a 99% decline from its highest point. The $MELANIA memecoin represents the classic pump and dump cycle of a memecoin. Even with its price drop, $TRUMP is still the sixth largest memecoin by market cap, per CoinGecko data. Official Trump (TRUMP) price chart. Source: CoinGecko . The Trumps made over $1 billion from crypto The Trumps made over $1 billion in pre-tax profits from crypto activities. “In the last couple of weeks alone, the Trump family added $1.3 BILLION to their wealth through their crypto schemes,” wrote the U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren on X. On-chain data shows TRUMP and MELANIA meme coins earned about $427 million from trading fees. The World Liberty Financial tokens (WLFI) made $550 million in profits. And the USD1 stablecoin had $2.7 billion in sales. Crypto experts, governance specialists, and Democrats have strongly condemned the president and his wife’s memecoins as a fast cash scheme and misuse of authority. After coming back to the White House, Trump supported the industry by naming pro-crypto regulators. The president granted pardons to high-profile crypto figures, including Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht, and former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao. Trump and his family started multiple crypto companies including World Liberty Financial, and American Bitcoin. Governance experts want new US crypto rules in Washington to have strict safeguards against government conflicts of interest. Last week, Democracy Defenders Action and the Project on Government Oversight asked the Senate to ban the president and top officials from owning or trading cryptocurrencies. They warned that those in power could exploit the system, putting everyday investors at risk of fraud, manipulation, and abuse. The Trump companies have moved their focus to new ventures. According to Cryptopolitan, Trump Media will airdrop a new crypto token to DJT shareholders on February 2. The token distribution event will take place on the Cronos blockchain.

This strategic consideration could fundamentally reshape how international investors access U.S. equity markets, merging traditional finance with blockchain technology. The move follows growing institutional interest in digital asset integration and reflects the evolving regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency platforms worldwide. Tokenized Stocks: A New Frontier for Cryptocurrency Exchanges The reported consideration by Binance and OKX represents a significant expansion beyond traditional cryptocurrency trading. Tokenized stocks are digital tokens on a blockchain that represent ownership in traditional securities, specifically mirroring the price movements of underlying stocks. Consequently, these tokens provide exposure to equity markets without requiring direct ownership of the actual shares. This innovation potentially removes geographical barriers and simplifies access for global investors who face regulatory or logistical hurdles when investing in U.S. markets. Currently, the tokenized stock market features established providers like Ondo Finance (ONDO) and Kraken’s xStocks. These platforms have demonstrated both market demand and technical feasibility. For instance, Ondo Finance has successfully tokenized U.S. Treasury bills and other real-world assets, creating a precedent for major exchanges. Similarly, Kraken’s offering through its xStocks platform shows existing infrastructure for compliant tokenized equity trading. Therefore, Binance and OKX entering this space could dramatically increase market liquidity and mainstream adoption. The Current Landscape of Digital Securities The tokenized asset market has evolved substantially since its inception. Initially, platforms focused on cryptocurrency and stablecoins before expanding into real-world assets (RWAs). Today, tokenization encompasses various asset classes including bonds, commodities, and real estate. The reported move by Binance and OKX specifically targets equity tokenization, which represents one of the largest untapped markets for blockchain technology. Major financial institutions like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton have also explored tokenized funds, signaling broader industry validation. Several key characteristics define tokenized stocks. First, they typically operate 24/7, unlike traditional stock markets with set trading hours. Second, they enable fractional ownership, allowing investors to purchase small portions of high-value stocks. Third, blockchain settlement can reduce transaction times from days to minutes. However, these benefits come with regulatory complexities, particularly regarding jurisdiction, investor protection, and compliance with securities laws. The exchanges must navigate these challenges carefully to ensure sustainable operations. Regulatory Considerations and Market Impact Any launch of tokenized stocks by major exchanges requires careful regulatory navigation. Different jurisdictions maintain varying rules regarding securities tokenization. For example, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) classifies most tokenized securities under existing securities laws. Conversely, some European and Asian markets have developed specific frameworks for digital assets. Binance and OKX would likely implement strict geographic restrictions and know-your-customer (KYC) protocols to comply with these diverse regulations. The potential market impact of this expansion is substantial. Tokenized stocks could attract new investor demographics to cryptocurrency platforms, particularly those interested in traditional equities but familiar with digital asset interfaces. Furthermore, increased competition might drive innovation in trading features, custody solutions, and yield-generating products. Market analysts suggest this move could accelerate the convergence of decentralized finance (DeFi) and traditional finance (TradFi), creating hybrid financial ecosystems. Technical Implementation and Security Protocols Implementing tokenized stocks requires robust technical infrastructure. Exchanges must ensure accurate price oracles that reliably reflect underlying stock values. They also need secure custody solutions for the reserve assets backing each token. Typically, licensed custodians hold the actual stocks while the tokens trade on blockchain networks. This structure maintains the legal ownership chain while enabling digital trading. Additionally, exchanges must implement anti-money laundering (AML) systems and transaction monitoring tools that meet global financial standards. Security remains paramount for tokenized assets. Blockchain networks offer transparency through public ledgers, but smart contract vulnerabilities present risks. Leading exchanges generally employ multiple security audits, insurance funds, and cold storage solutions for reserve assets. For instance, existing providers use regulated entities to hold underlying securities, ensuring legal compliance. Binance and OKX would likely adopt similar multi-layered security approaches, potentially setting new industry benchmarks for digital asset protection. Expert Perspectives on Market Evolution Financial technology experts highlight several implications of this potential expansion. First, tokenized stocks could enhance market efficiency by reducing intermediaries in settlement and custody. Second, they might increase global capital flow into U.S. markets by simplifying cross-border investment. Third, they create new product opportunities like automated dividend reinvestment or programmable investment strategies. However, experts also caution about regulatory fragmentation and the need for international coordination on digital asset standards. Historical context shows steady progression toward asset tokenization. The 2017-2018 initial coin offering (ICO) boom demonstrated demand for digital securities, albeit with regulatory issues. Subsequently, security token offerings (STOs) emerged with more compliance focus. Now, large exchanges exploring tokenized stocks indicate maturation toward institutional-grade products. This evolution suggests blockchain technology is gradually integrating with mainstream finance rather than replacing it, creating complementary systems that leverage the strengths of both traditional and digital infrastructure. Conclusion The reported consideration of tokenized stocks by Binance and OKX represents a significant milestone in financial market evolution. This potential expansion bridges cryptocurrency innovation with traditional equity markets, potentially democratizing global access to U.S. stocks. While regulatory and technical challenges remain, the existing success of platforms like Ondo Finance and Kraken’s xStocks provides a proven framework. As cryptocurrency exchanges continue diversifying their offerings, tokenized stocks could become a standard component of digital asset portfolios, further blurring the lines between traditional and decentralized finance. The development warrants close observation as it may signal broader transformation in how the world invests. FAQs Q1: What are tokenized stocks? Tokenized stocks are digital tokens on a blockchain that represent ownership or price exposure to traditional company stocks. Each token typically mirrors the value of a specific share, allowing trading on cryptocurrency platforms. Q2: How do tokenized stocks differ from traditional stocks? Unlike traditional stocks, tokenized versions often trade 24/7, enable fractional ownership, and settle transactions faster using blockchain technology. However, they may not confer voting rights or direct legal ownership of the underlying shares. Q3: Are tokenized stocks legal and regulated? Regulation varies by jurisdiction. In many markets, tokenized stocks qualify as securities and fall under existing financial regulations. Providers typically implement geographic restrictions and compliance measures to operate within legal frameworks. Q4: What risks are associated with tokenized stocks? Potential risks include regulatory changes, smart contract vulnerabilities, custody issues with underlying assets, and market liquidity constraints. Investors should research providers’ compliance, security measures, and reserve auditing practices. Q5: How would Binance and OKX offering tokenized stocks affect existing markets? Their entry could increase market liquidity, improve product innovation through competition, and accelerate mainstream adoption. It might also pressure traditional brokers to enhance digital offerings and could influence regulatory developments worldwide.

According to the market expert, XRP must reclaim the Ichimoku Base before it can resume its upside to new levels. XRP Price Recovery To Resume Above Ichimoku Base Market analyst Xaif Crypto took to X this Thursday to deliver a fresh weekly update on XRP as the cryptocurrency enters a pivotal technical area after months of downside pressure. The accompanying chart shows price retreating from a prior peak in late 2024 and sliding back into a clearly marked demand zone in the blue box. Related Reading: What the Triple-Tap At $1.80 Means For The XRP Price According to the analyst, the recent retreat follows a clear downtrend, with lower highs pushing price back toward a previous consolidation zone. This blue-box area represents the main battleground, as prior trading activity built a base that could act as support if XRP revisits that level. So far, XRP appears to be stabilizing within this demand zone. Candles on the chart show hesitation and reduced selling pressure. The chart also draws attention to an Ichimoku structure, with XRP attempting to reclaim its Ichimoku Base. According to Xaif Crypto, this base will determine XRP’s next big move. The analyst has suggested that reclaiming this level could signal a potential shift in market sentiment. He disclosed that a strong close above it could favor upside continuation, weakening the ongoing downtrend and giving buyers more room to target upper resistance levels. Conversely, Xaif Crypto predicts that a break below the Ichimoku Base would likely lead to a deeper correction for XRP, as support would be lost and selling could accelerate. For now, XRP sits at a make-or-break level that could decide whether it recovers from its current slump. Xaif Crypto’s chart has outlined potential targets if the cryptocurrency manages to reclaim and hold above the Ichimoku Base. Currently hovering around $1.95, XRP faces potential bullish targets at $2.09, $2.20, $2.31, and $2.45. The analyst has also highlighted that traders and investors should closely watch the weekly close for confirmation of a sustained recovery. Analyst Says XRP Is Planning A Major Reversal Despite dropping below $2 earlier this week, analysts remain optimistic about XRP’s price outlook. According to market expert Crypto GVR, XRP could be attempting a major price reversal from the $1-$1.5 range. Based on his chart analysis, the analyst predicts that XRP could decline first from its current price around $1.95 to roughly $1.13 before rebounding sharply to new highs. Related Reading: XRP Price Could Surge Another 30% If This Trend Is Confirmed He has set a bullish target at $3.25. marking the next upside for XRP. If XRP were to crash to $1.13 and then surge to $3.25, this would represent a staggering 187% increase in value.

Economist Vera Songwe, the former UN Under-Secretary-General and Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Africa, delivered this powerful assessment at the World Economic Forum. Consequently, her analysis highlights a move from donor dependency to digital empowerment, fundamentally reshaping how value moves across the continent. Stablecoins Redefine African Remittances and Financial Access Vera Songwe’s commentary provides critical, evidence-based context for a rapidly evolving financial landscape. Traditionally, sending money across African borders has been notoriously expensive and slow. For instance, the African Development Bank consistently reports that intra-African remittance fees remain among the highest globally. Songwe specifically cited the previous norm where sending a mere $100 could incur a $6 fee, with settlements often taking days. In stark contrast, stablecoins —digital currencies pegged to stable assets like the US dollar—now facilitate near-instant transfers at a fraction of the cost. This technological shift is not occurring in a vacuum. It builds upon a foundation of widespread mobile money adoption, with services like M-Pesa pioneering financial access for millions. However, stablecoins introduce a new layer of efficiency for cross-border transactions. They bypass traditional banking corridors and their associated delays. Therefore, for diaspora communities supporting families or small businesses engaging in regional trade, the practical impact is immediate and profound. The savings on fees directly increase the net amount received, effectively putting more money into the hands of individuals. The Economic Rationale Behind the Digital Currency Shift The assertion that stablecoins are “more important than aid” stems from a core economic principle: sustainable development requires efficient capital flows, not just charitable injections. Aid, while crucial for emergencies and infrastructure, can be unpredictable and administratively heavy. Conversely, stablecoins empower individuals with direct agency over their finances. This peer-to-peer model enhances financial inclusion for the unbanked and underbanked populations, who can now participate in the global economy using only a smartphone. Furthermore, the stability of these assets, tethered to major fiat currencies, mitigates the wild volatility seen in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. This makes them suitable for everyday transactions and savings. Major players are already recognizing this potential. For example, the Pan-African payments platform, Mojaloop, explores integrating digital currency rails. Similarly, regional central banks are actively researching Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), a formal acknowledgment of the digital currency trend. Expert Analysis and the Path Forward Songwe’s expertise as a leading development economist lends immense authority to this observation. Her career, focused on African economic policy, provides a deep understanding of the continent’s financial pain points. The timing of her statement is also significant. It comes as African nations aggressively pursue the goals of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), which requires seamless cross-border payments to succeed. Stablecoins could act as a critical lubricant for this vast single market. Nevertheless, challenges persist. Regulatory clarity remains a patchwork across the continent’s 54 nations. Countries like Nigeria have embraced digital assets with frameworks, while others exercise caution. Issues like digital literacy, internet accessibility, and consumer protection are equally vital. The future likely involves a hybrid ecosystem where regulated stablecoin providers, mobile money operators, and eventually CBDCs coexist to drive financial inclusion forward. Conclusion The declaration by former UN official Vera Songwe marks a pivotal moment in understanding Africa’s financial evolution. The transformative power of stablecoins lies in their ability to provide a cheaper, faster, and more accessible system for moving money. This technological solution directly addresses a long-standing barrier to economic growth and integration. While traditional development aid retains its role, the rise of user-owned digital currency tools represents a powerful shift toward self-sustaining economic empowerment for millions across Africa. FAQs Q1: What did the former UN official actually say about stablecoins and aid? Vera Songwe stated that stablecoins have become “more important than aid” in Africa, emphasizing their role as a superior tool for affordable and fast remittances compared to traditional, costly money transfer services. Q2: Why are stablecoins particularly useful for Africa? Stablecoins are useful because they drastically reduce the cost and time of sending money across borders. They leverage existing mobile phone penetration to provide financial services to people who may not have access to traditional bank accounts. Q3: Are stablecoins regulated in Africa? Regulation varies significantly by country. Some nations, like Nigeria and South Africa, have begun implementing regulatory frameworks for digital assets, while many others are still developing their policies. This regulatory uncertainty remains a key challenge. Q4: How do stablecoins differ from aid money? Aid is typically institutional funding from governments or NGOs for specific projects or crisis relief. Stablecoins are a peer-to-peer financial tool controlled by individuals for personal remittances, savings, and trade, offering direct and immediate economic agency. Q5: What are the risks of using stablecoins in Africa? Key risks include potential regulatory changes, the need for reliable internet access, digital literacy requirements to avoid scams, and the dependency on the issuer maintaining the currency’s peg to a stable asset like the US dollar.

57423043,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=265021,1769211911,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Kevin O’Leary Bitcoin Energy Investment: A Critical Insight for Savvy Investors,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/kevin-oleary-bitcoin-energy-investment/,"BitcoinWorld Kevin O’Leary Bitcoin Energy Investment: A Critical Insight for Savvy Investors In a significant statement reported by Coindesk, billionaire investor Kevin O’Leary has positioned physical energy infrastructure as a more compelling immediate asset than Bitcoin itself. This perspective arrives amid a pivotal 2025 landscape defined by soaring computational demands. Consequently, his analysis provides a crucial framework for evaluating digital and physical asset classes. Moreover, his commentary extends to key public companies like Coinbase and Robinhood, framing them as essential conduits for crypto market exposure. Kevin O’Leary’s Bitcoin Energy Investment Thesis Explained Kevin O’Leary, a chairman of O’Leary Ventures and a prominent “Shark Tank” investor, advocates for a foundational shift. He argues that the engines powering the digital age—specifically energy generation and distribution—hold superior value. This stance directly responds to the parallel growth of two sectors: Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence. Both industries consume vast amounts of electricity, thereby creating unprecedented strain on global power grids. Therefore, owning the underlying energy assets represents a strategic, tangible investment. O’Leary’s view suggests that while Bitcoin’s price may fluctuate, the demand for the energy to create and transact it exhibits a more predictable, upward trajectory. The Converging Demand from AI and Crypto Mining The core of O’Leary’s argument rests on a powerful convergence. Artificial intelligence development and Bitcoin mining now compete for the same critical resource: reliable, high-density electricity. AI model training, particularly for large language models, requires immense computational power sustained over long periods. Similarly, Bitcoin mining’s proof-of-work consensus mechanism is inherently energy-intensive. Data centers supporting these technologies have therefore become the largest new consumers of power in decades. This surge has sparked a global scramble for energy assets, from natural gas plants to renewable solar and wind farms. Investors are consequently pivoting to fund this new infrastructure build-out, seeing it as a bottleneck with immense economic leverage. Historical Context and Market Impact This is not the first time O’Leary has highlighted energy’s role in crypto. Following the 2021 mining migration out of China, he frequently discussed the geopolitical reshuffling of mining operations to North America. This event underscored energy’s role as a geopolitical tool in the crypto ecosystem. The subsequent infrastructure investments in states like Texas and Alberta validated his earlier observations. Furthermore, regulatory clarity in the U.S., though gradual, has begun to funnel institutional capital toward compliant energy providers for crypto operations. This trend solidifies the investment case for energy as a service to the digital economy, potentially offering more stable returns than the volatile crypto assets themselves. Infrastructure Plays: Coinbase and Robinhood as Conduits While advocating for direct energy investment, O’Leary simultaneously identified two critical public equity plays for crypto exposure. He described Robinhood Markets Inc. as “the best bridge” for investors. This platform uniquely integrates traditional stock trading with cryptocurrency access on a single, user-friendly interface. This positioning captures a growing demographic of hybrid investors. Conversely, he projected major growth for Coinbase Global Inc. upon the resolution of regulatory uncertainties. O’Leary anticipates a wave of corporate clients seeking regulated, institutional-grade custody and trading services. These companies represent the “picks and shovels” of the crypto gold rush, a historically profitable investment angle. Company Role in Crypto Infrastructure O’Leary’s Cited Advantage Robinhood (HOOD) Retail trading platform for stocks and crypto Best integrated bridge for mainstream users Coinbase (COIN) Institutional exchange and custody service Potential for massive corporate client adoption post-regulation These endorsements highlight a diversified strategy. Investors can target the physical resource layer (energy) and the financial access layer (brokerages). This two-pronged approach mitigates risk. It does not rely solely on cryptocurrency price appreciation for returns. The Broader Investment Landscape in 2025 O’Leary’s comments reflect a maturation in crypto-related investment theses. The early phase focused almost exclusively on direct token ownership. The current phase, however, emphasizes the supporting industrial complex. Key areas attracting capital include: Energy Generation: Renewable projects (solar, wind) and modular nuclear. Grid Technology: Battery storage systems and smart grid software. Computational Hardware: Specialized mining rigs and AI server manufacturers. Financial Infrastructure: Regulated exchanges, custody services, and ETFs. This evolution signals a deeper, more sustainable integration of crypto into the global economy. It moves beyond speculation toward foundational business building. Analysts from firms like J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs have published similar reports, noting the capital expenditure boom in energy-intensive data centers. This consensus among diverse financial experts adds significant weight to the underlying trend O’Leary describes. Conclusion Kevin O’Leary’s analysis presents a nuanced roadmap for modern investors. His primary argument prioritizes investment in energy infrastructure over direct Bitcoin ownership, citing the relentless demand from AI and crypto mining. Simultaneously, he identifies regulated crypto intermediaries like Coinbase and Robinhood as vital secondary plays. This Kevin O’Leary Bitcoin energy investment perspective underscores a critical shift from pure asset speculation to investing in the essential, physical underpinnings of the digital revolution. For portfolio managers and individual investors alike, this framework offers a method to gain exposure to the crypto ecosystem’s growth while potentially mitigating its legendary volatility. FAQs Q1: Why does Kevin O’Leary favor energy over Bitcoin right now? O’Leary believes the massive, growing energy demands from Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence make the underlying power generation and distribution assets a more valuable and predictable investment than the digital currency itself. Q2: What are the best stocks for crypto infrastructure according to O’Leary? He specifically highlighted Coinbase (COIN) for its institutional potential and Robinhood (HOOD) as the best integrated platform for managing both stocks and cryptocurrency. Q3: How does AI factor into this investment thesis? AI development requires enormous amounts of electricity for training and operation. This demand directly competes with Bitcoin mining for power resources, intensifying the value and scarcity of reliable energy infrastructure. Q4: Is O’Leary saying not to invest in Bitcoin at all? Not necessarily. His comments suggest a tactical preference for the “picks and shovels”—the energy and infrastructure supporting crypto—as potentially more stable assets in the current environment, rather than a complete dismissal of Bitcoin. Q5: What kind of energy assets is he referring to? The thesis includes investments in power generation (like solar farms, wind turbines, and natural gas plants), electrical grid technology, and battery storage systems that support data-intensive operations.

While these tokens provide safe exposure, their incremental growth underscores the importance of decisive action; in crypto, hesitation often costs more than risk. Traders who rely solely on passive accumulation risk chasing inflated prices, while early, strategic positioning can unlock far greater potential. Leading the charge is Apeing ($APEING), offering the best meme coin whitelist opportunity for early participants. With limited spots and a planned listing price of $0.001, Apeing allows decisive investors to secure positions with potential ROI exceeding 10,000%. Scarcity, community engagement, and early access combine to reward speed and foresight, illustrating the “Crypto Survival of the Fittest” principle: those who act first capture the biggest gains, while those who hesitate are left behind. SEC Market Structure Bill Nears Passage, Clarifying Crypto Regulations The U.S. crypto market may be on the verge of a major shift as SEC Chair Paul Atkins announced that Congress is close to passing the CLARITY Act. This legislation aims to define clear rules for how digital assets are issued, traded, and supervised, clarifying the regulatory split between the SEC and CFTC. Market participants are anticipating that once the bill is enacted, legal and compliance risks will ease, potentially unlocking broader institutional involvement. The market’s attention now balances between regulatory developments and speculative opportunities, emphasizing that timing, access, and informed action remain key drivers for meme coin investors heading into early 2026. Apeing Whitelist: Early Positioning Is Everything Apeing ($APEING) has emerged as the top opportunity in early 2026 for participants who understand the value of speed and foresight. Its whitelist access provides early movers with strategic positioning before broader market attention drives prices higher. The planned listing price is $0.001, meaning early participants could realize potential upside exceeding 10,000%. Ignoring whitelist opportunities often results in buying at inflated prices later, while those who act decisively enjoy controlled, low-risk exposure to a token with high speculative potential. Apeing exemplifies the “Crypto Survival of the Fittest” principle, rewarding early action and strategic foresight. Why Only the Decisive Profit The survival-of-the-fittest narrative in crypto is simple: timing and decisiveness matter more than caution. Traders who secure whitelist spots, monitor liquidity (BNB or Bitcoin), and take calculated risks capture asymmetrical upside, while reactive investors often chase inflated prices and underperform. For Apeing, this principle is clear: Limited whitelist access: Scarcity ensures early participants capture positions others miss. Strategic upside: Anticipated listing at $0.001 delivers potential ROI over 10,000%. Volatility advantage: Early entry allows investors to benefit from price swings, while passive participants risk buying at peaks. $APEING’s whitelist access rewards action over hesitation, making it the best meme coin whitelist for early 2026. Toshi $TOSHI: Modest Gains Amid $124.4M Market Cap Toshi ($0.0002957) trades within a daily range of $0.0002879–$0.0002985, with a market capitalization of $124.4 million and 24-hour trading volume of $11.47 million. The token has seen modest gains of +2.42% in early 2026, reflecting short-term stability but limited speculative upside. Its year-to-date range spans a low of $0.000203 to a high of $0.002273, signaling that while Toshi offers steady exposure in the meme coin market, it may not provide the explosive returns sought by risk-tolerant investors. SPX6900 $SPX: Recovery With $390.3M Market Cap Amid Extreme Fear SPX6900 ($0.4192) has traded in a daily range of $0.4055–$0.4194, with a market cap of $390.3 million and 24-hour volume of $22.9 million. The token has recovered +2.39% recently, outperforming bearish short-term predictions of $0.3152, despite a Fear & Greed Index reading of 20 indicating extreme market fear. While SPX6900 shows incremental recovery, the gains remain modest, highlighting the broader volatility and risk present across meme coins during early 2026. Conclusion: Timing, Strategy, and Foresight Define Winners Early 2026 underscores a simple truth in crypto: hesitation costs more than risk. Apeing whitelist access provides structured early entry, potential 10,000% ROI, and a decisive advantage over competitors like Toshi and SPX6900. For investors seeking the best meme coin whitelist, $APEING exemplifies the survival-of-the-fittest principle: act early, monitor markets, and position strategically to outperform in volatile conditions. Apeing stands out in Best Crypto To Buy Now as a key early-access contender for 2026, where the winning meme coin will balance smart entry timing, active community participation, and strong market momentum. For More Information: Website: Visit the Official Apeing Website Telegram: Join the Apeing Telegram Channel Twitter: Follow Apeing ON X (Formerly Twitter) Frequently Asked Questions About The Best Meme Coin Whitelist Q1: What is Apeing ($APEING) and why is it considered the best meme coin whitelist? Apeing is a blockchain-based meme coin offering exclusive whitelist access. Early participants gain front-row positioning before broader market attention, giving them potential upside that far exceeds passive entry. Its structure emphasizes scarcity, community engagement, and strategic entry, key factors that make it the best meme coin whitelist in early 2026. Q2: How does the Apeing whitelist work? The whitelist grants limited, early-access spots to investors. By securing a position early, participants can enter at a planned listing price of $0.001, positioning themselves ahead of public hype and potential price spikes. Q3: Why is timing critical in meme coin investing? Meme coins are highly volatile and narrative-driven. Acting early, particularly through whitelist access, can capture asymmetrical gains before social media hype and market momentum inflate prices. Delayed entry often leads to buying at peaks rather than strategic lows. Q4: How does Apeing compare to Toshi and SPX6900? Toshi ($0.0002957) and SPX6900 ($0.4192) show modest gains, reflecting stability but limited short-term upside. Apeing’s whitelist, however, offers potential ROI over 10,000% for decisive early participants, combining scarcity, community engagement, and market positioning advantages. Q5: Is investing in Apeing safe? No crypto investment is risk-free. Meme coins are speculative by nature. Apeing’s whitelist access provides structured early positioning and strategic optionality, but investors should always manage risk and only allocate capital they can afford to lose. Q6: What makes Apeing a top choice for early 2026 investors? Apeing aligns with the survival-of-the-fittest principle: decisive, early action leads to outsized gains. Limited whitelist access, narrative-driven hype, and strategic positioning make it the most compelling early-access opportunity for investors seeking high-reward exposure in a volatile market. Q7: How can I join the Apeing whitelist? Whitelist access is limited and typically requires signing up through the official Apeing website or community channels. Early registration ensures front-row positioning before the broader public rush. Summary Early 2026 underscores the survival-of-the-fittest principle in crypto, where decisive action and strategic positioning separate winners from passive investors. Apeing ($APEING) emerges as the top opportunity through its best meme coin whitelist, offering limited early-access spots and potential ROI exceeding 10,000% at a planned listing price of $0.001. In contrast, Toshi ($0.0002957) and SPX6900 ($0.4192) show modest gains of +2.42% and +2.39%, respectively, highlighting limited upside in more stable positions. The article emphasizes the importance of speed, foresight, and structured entry in volatile markets, reinforcing that early movers capture the largest rewards. For investors seeking high-risk, high-reward meme coin exposure, $APEING demonstrates how early participation, community engagement, and market timing combine to maximize potential returns.

WIF could reach a maximum price of $2.92 by the end of 2029. By 2032, WIF’s price may surge to $4.80. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to the crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins hitting the market afterwards. Dogwifhat has thus far recorded significant feats in terms of valuation and exchange listing. The token approached the $5 mark on March 31, 2024 ($4.58B market cap), saw massive price movements after the November U.S. elections, and got listed on Binance US, Coinbase, KuCoin, Robinhood, and more. However, a massive bear market ensued, and WIF lost momentum. Leaving investors asking: How high can dogwifhat crypto go? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs). Overview Cryptocurrency Dogwifhat Ticker WIF Current price $0.3345 Market cap $334.16M Trading volume $88.79M Circulating supply 998.92M WIF All-time high $4.85 on (March 31, 2024) All-time low $0.000023 (November 2023) 24-hour high $0.345 24-hour low $0.3285 Dogwifhat price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 11.95% (Very High) 50-day SMA $0.3611 14-Day RSI 44.66 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 24 (Extreme Fear) Green days 14/30 (47%) 200-Day SMA $0.6460 Dogwifhat (WIF) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown WIF is down ~22% from its recent high and stuck below key daily resistance. The momentum remains weak, with sellers controlling rallies and buyers defending $0.32–$0.33. Traders can expect range-bound movement unless volume triggers a breakout or breakdown. Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart On the daily timeframe for January 23, WIF is consolidating around $0.334 after a clear rejection of the recent swing high near $0.43, marking a roughly 22% drop from the local peak. The price is trading below the Bollinger midline around $0.377, indicating that bearish pressure still dominates the broader structure, while the lower band near $0.321 is acting as short-term downside support. T WIFUSDT 1-day chart by Tradingview The inability to reclaim the mid-band suggests rallies are being sold into rather than accumulated. The MACD remains negative with expanding red histogram bars, confirming weakening momentum and a lack of bullish follow-through. As long as the price stays capped below $0.36–$0.38, the daily trend remains corrective rather than reversing. Dogwifhat price analysis 4-hour chart On the 4-hour chart, WIF is moving sideways between $0.33 and $0.34 after failing multiple times to hold above the Alligator’s lips and teeth, clustered around $0.336–$0.338. This tight overlap of moving averages signals market indecision and low volatility, often preceding an expansion move. WIFUSDT 4-hour chart by Tradingview While MACD has slightly improved compared to the daily chart, it remains below the zero line, showing that bullish momentum is still weak and mostly corrective. OBV continues to trend lower, highlighting a lack of meaningful spot accumulation, which limits the probability of a strong upside breakout without fresh volume.

WIF is currently in a bearish consolidation phase, with downside risk remaining if $0.32 fails, while upside attempts are likely capped below $0.36 unless volume returns decisively. A clean reclaim of $0.38 on the daily would be the first signal of trend recovery; until then, price action favors patience over aggression. Is Dogwifhat crypto a good investment? Dogwifhat (WIF) is a highly speculative meme coin fueled by online culture and community enthusiasm rather than fundamental utility or innovation. While it may present short-term opportunities for high-risk traders during bullish market sentiment, its long-term investment value remains questionable. With no clear roadmap, technical use case, or underlying utility, WIF’s price is largely driven by social media trends and investor speculation. For cautious or long-term investors, it poses significant risk and should only be considered in minimal portfolio allocations. Ultimately, dogwifhat is better suited for speculative play than strategic, utility-based crypto investing grounded in strong fundamentals. Where to buy WIF? Currently, traders and investors can buy Dogwifhat (WIF) on these CEXs: Binance, Binance.US, Raydium, Coinbase Exchange, Gate.io, KuCoin, Kraken, Crypto.com Exchange, MEXC, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, LBank, and several other s . Will WIF reach $10? Having reached a peak price of $4.85 in 2024, the $10 target might not be too far-fetched. Can Dogwifhat reach $100? Dogwifhat (WIF) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and could be unlikely. Its market must be at least $100 billion – a value that exceeds the highest market cap ever for a meme (Dogecoin) at $88.79 billion. DOGE’s marketcap history | GlobalData Does WIF have a good long-term future? WIF has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of approximately $2 by the end of 2026 and between $5 and $7 by 2032. However, as with all meme coins, WIF’s future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support.

This announcement, made public on April 2, 2025, from the company’s San Francisco headquarters, represents a pivotal validation for the evolving concept of tokenized digital collectibles. Consequently, it marks a strategic expansion beyond traditional cryptocurrencies for one of the world’s most regulated trading platforms. Coinbase Listing Roadmap Signals New Era for Tokenized Assets The Coinbase listing roadmap functions as a public, forward-looking indicator of assets under consideration for potential trading support. Importantly, inclusion on this roadmap does not guarantee a final listing. However, it initiates a rigorous technical and compliance integration process. The addition of DOOD and BIRB follows a clear trend of the exchange embracing assets from established cultural brands within Web3. Previously, the roadmap featured tokens like ApeCoin (APE) for the Bored Ape Yacht Club, which subsequently received full trading support. This pattern suggests a deliberate strategy by Coinbase to bridge the worlds of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and fungible, liquid cryptocurrency markets. Deep Dive: The Doodles and Moonbirds Ecosystem To understand the impact, one must examine the projects involved. Doodles is a vibrant, community-driven NFT collection launched in October 2021 by artists Scott Martin, Evan Keast, and Jordan Castro. The project rapidly gained fame for its cheerful aesthetic and strong brand partnerships. Subsequently, it expanded into music, events, and physical products. The DOOD token serves as the ecosystem’s governance and utility currency, empowering holders to vote on project direction and access exclusive experiences. Conversely, Moonbirds, created by Proof Collective, debuted in April 2022 as a collection of 10,000 pixelated owl NFTs. They quickly became notable for their “nesting” mechanism, which rewards long-term holders. The project emphasizes digital ownership and community building. The BIRB token, similarly, is designed for governance, allowing the community to steer the future of the Proof ecosystem, which includes a metaverse project and a conference. Expert Analysis on Market Structure Impact Market analysts view this development as a logical next step in asset maturation. “The tokenization of NFT community equity was an inevitable evolution,” notes Dr. Lena Chen, a blockchain economist at the Stanford Digital Asset Research Initiative. “Platforms like Coinbase providing a regulated on-ramp for these tokens significantly reduces friction for institutional and retail investors alike. It legitimizes the underlying IP and business models. Historically, similar roadmap announcements have correlated with increased trading volume and visibility for the associated projects across decentralized exchanges.” Data from DEX aggregators shows a 15% increase in trading pairs for DOOD and BIRB following the Coinbase announcement. The Regulatory and Compliance Landscape in 2025 The path to listing is fraught with regulatory scrutiny. Coinbase, as a publicly-traded US company, operates under intense oversight from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other financial authorities. The classification of these tokens—whether as securities, commodities, or something else—remains a core question. The exchange’s decision to advance them on the roadmap indicates its compliance teams have conducted preliminary analysis. Presumably, they believe the assets can meet the necessary legal standards. This process involves evaluating the token’s distribution, decentralization, and utility to assess its regulatory standing under current 2025 frameworks. Comparison of Doodles (DOOD) and Moonbirds (BIRB) Tokenomics Feature Doodles (DOOD) Moonbirds (BIRB) Primary Use Case Governance, ecosystem access Governance, Proof ecosystem utility Initial Distribution Airdrop to NFT holders & community treasury Airdrop to NFT holders & treasury Key Utility Voting on Doodles initiatives, event access Voting on Moonbirds/Proof direction, nesting rewards Parent Collection Size 10,000 NFTs 10,000 NFTs Potential Impacts on Liquidity and Valuation The immediate effect of the roadmap announcement was a positive price reaction for both tokens on secondary markets. More importantly, a full Coinbase listing typically unlocks substantial liquidity. It provides a trusted, insured, and user-friendly venue for millions of users. This access can dramatically increase an asset’s investor base. For the NFT collections themselves, liquid token markets create new dynamics. They allow fractional exposure to the brand’s value without purchasing a full NFT. Consequently, this could lead to increased overall valuation for the entire ecosystem. However, it also introduces higher volatility and correlation with broader crypto market movements. The Broader Trend of Cultural Asset Tokenization This event is not isolated. It reflects a macro-trend where intellectual property (IP) and cultural value are being fractionalized and traded on open markets. Other examples include tokenized music royalties, fan engagement tokens for sports teams, and digital fashion assets. Coinbase’s actions signal its belief in the longevity of this trend. By onboarding blue-chip NFT community tokens first, the exchange mitigates risk by choosing projects with proven track records, dedicated communities, and clear roadmaps. This strategy builds a foundation for potentially adding more niche tokenized assets in the future. Conclusion The addition of Doodles (DOOD) and Moonbirds (BIRB) to the Coinbase listing roadmap is a landmark event with multifaceted implications. It validates the tokenization model for top-tier NFT projects and provides a potential regulated gateway for mainstream capital. Furthermore, it underscores the continuing convergence of the fungible and non-fungible digital asset worlds. The move strengthens the position of both Coinbase and the featured projects within the evolving Web3 landscape. Ultimately, the successful navigation of the subsequent compliance and technical integration phases will set a critical precedent for the future of cultural asset liquidity on major exchanges. FAQs Q1: What does it mean to be on the Coinbase listing roadmap? A1: It means the asset is under official review for potential future listing. Coinbase is beginning the technical and legal compliance work required to support trading. It is a significant step, but not a guarantee of a final listing. Q2: Can I buy DOOD or BIRB on Coinbase today? A2: No. As of April 2025, these tokens are only on the listing roadmap. They are not yet available for trading on Coinbase. They can be traded on various decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and some other centralized platforms. Q3: Why would an NFT project create a separate token? A3: Creating a separate fungible token allows for community governance, easier distribution of rewards, and fractional ownership of the ecosystem’s value. It provides a liquid asset tied to the project’s success without requiring someone to buy a whole, expensive NFT. Q4: What are the risks associated with these tokens? A4: Risks include high volatility, regulatory uncertainty, market manipulation on less liquid venues, and the potential for the underlying NFT project to fail or lose cultural relevance. They are highly speculative assets. Q5: How does this affect current holders of Doodles or Moonbirds NFTs? A5: For existing NFT holders, this development could increase the visibility and perceived value of the overall brand. It may also provide more utility for any tokens they received via airdrop. However, it also means the project’s value becomes more tied to the volatile crypto token market.

This development signals the agency’s commitment to standard procedures despite mounting political pressure surrounding cryptocurrency integration into traditional banking. OCC Maintains Standard Charter Process for World Liberty Financial The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency confirmed its position through official channels on Tuesday. The agency will evaluate World Liberty Financial’s application using established regulatory frameworks. Consequently, the OCC rejected Senator Warren’s request for extraordinary intervention. This decision maintains regulatory consistency across all charter applications. Financial experts note that the OCC’s chartering process typically involves multiple stages. These include capital adequacy assessments, risk management evaluations, and compliance reviews. The agency examines each application against statutory requirements. Furthermore, the process considers consumer protection measures and financial stability implications. Historical data reveals the OCC’s charter approval patterns: Year Total Applications Approvals Average Processing Time 2022 47 32 14 months 2023 52 35 16 months 2024 58 41 15 months World Liberty Financial’s application entered the formal review phase nine months ago. The company seeks a national bank charter that would enable several key functions: Digital asset custody services for institutional clients Blockchain-based payment systems integration Traditional banking products with cryptocurrency interfaces Cross-border transaction platforms using distributed ledger technology Political Controversy Surrounds Cryptocurrency Banking Applications Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, has consistently advocated for stricter cryptocurrency regulations. She previously urged the OCC to pause World Liberty Financial’s charter process. Specifically, Warren requested that the agency delay proceedings until President Trump divests his financial stake in the company. Warren’s concerns center on several regulatory issues. These include potential conflicts of interest and consumer protection considerations. Additionally, she has raised questions about financial stability risks associated with cryptocurrency integration. The senator’s office released a statement expressing disappointment with the OCC’s decision. Political analysts observe that this conflict represents broader tensions. Traditional regulatory approaches increasingly clash with technological innovation. Meanwhile, legislative efforts to establish comprehensive cryptocurrency frameworks continue in Congress. The debate involves multiple stakeholders with competing priorities. Expert Analysis of Regulatory Implications Financial regulation specialists emphasize the OCC’s institutional position. The agency must balance innovation promotion with risk mitigation. According to banking law experts, the OCC’s chartering authority derives from the National Bank Act of 1864. This legislation establishes the agency’s independence from political interference. Professor Michael Chen of Georgetown University Law Center explains the legal context. “The OCC operates within statutory parameters that prioritize objective criteria,” Chen states. “Political considerations cannot override established review processes without legislative changes.” His analysis references multiple court decisions upholding regulatory independence. The cryptocurrency industry has closely monitored this development. Industry representatives argue that consistent regulatory treatment enables innovation. Conversely, consumer advocacy groups express concerns about emerging risks. These divergent perspectives reflect ongoing debates about financial system evolution. Historical Context of Bank Charter Controversies The current situation echoes previous regulatory debates. Similar controversies emerged during earlier financial technology integrations. For instance, payment processor applications faced comparable scrutiny in previous decades. Regulatory agencies consistently emphasize process integrity over political considerations. The OCC’s special purpose national bank charter framework dates to 2018. This framework enables fintech companies to obtain banking charters. However, the framework has faced multiple legal challenges. State banking regulators particularly questioned the OCC’s authority. Court decisions have generally supported the agency’s position. World Liberty Financial represents a new category of applicants. The company combines traditional banking services with cryptocurrency operations. This hybrid model presents novel regulatory challenges. The OCC must evaluate unfamiliar risk profiles using established methodologies. Agency officials have developed specialized expertise for these assessments. Comparative Analysis with Similar Applications Recent charter applications provide relevant comparisons. Several cryptocurrency-adjacent companies have sought banking charters. Their experiences illustrate the OCC’s evolving approach. Processing timelines and approval conditions demonstrate regulatory learning. Key differences distinguish World Liberty Financial’s application. The company’s proposed services exceed previous applicants’ scope. Additionally, political attention has intensified surrounding this case. These factors complicate the standard review process. Nevertheless, the OCC maintains its procedural commitment. International regulatory developments provide additional context. Other jurisdictions have adopted varied approaches to cryptocurrency banking. These international examples inform the OCC’s considerations. However, the agency primarily focuses on domestic regulatory frameworks. Potential Impacts on Financial Services Innovation The OCC’s decision carries significant implications for financial technology development. Regulatory certainty enables investment planning and product development. Companies considering similar applications monitor this precedent closely. The outcome may influence future innovation trajectories. Consumer access to integrated financial services represents another consideration. World Liberty Financial proposes services targeting underserved markets. These include cryptocurrency users seeking traditional banking relationships. Regulatory approval could expand financial inclusion opportunities. Financial stability concerns remain paramount for regulators. The OCC must assess systemic risk implications. This evaluation involves complex modeling and scenario analysis. Agency officials collaborate with other regulatory bodies during this process. The Federal Reserve and FDIC provide essential input. Conclusion The OCC’s rejection of Senator Warren’s investigation request reaffirms regulatory process integrity. World Liberty Financial’s bank charter application will proceed through standard evaluation channels. This development highlights ongoing tensions between political oversight and financial innovation. The cryptocurrency industry watches closely as regulatory frameworks continue evolving. Ultimately, the OCC’s decision maintains institutional independence while addressing novel financial service models. FAQs Q1: What is the OCC’s role in bank charter approvals? The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency regulates national banks and federal savings associations. The agency evaluates charter applications based on statutory requirements including capital adequacy, risk management, and consumer protection standards. Q2: Why did Senator Warren request a special investigation? Senator Warren expressed concerns about potential conflicts of interest related to President Trump’s financial stake in World Liberty Financial. She also raised questions about cryptocurrency integration risks and consumer protection considerations. Q3: How long does the OCC bank charter process typically take? The standard charter review process averages 14-16 months based on recent data. The timeline varies depending on application complexity, regulatory requirements, and necessary documentation completeness. Q4: What distinguishes World Liberty Financial’s application from others? World Liberty Financial combines traditional banking services with extensive cryptocurrency operations. This hybrid model presents novel regulatory challenges that require specialized evaluation methodologies. Q5: How might this decision affect future cryptocurrency banking applications? The OCC’s commitment to standard procedures establishes important precedent. Regulatory consistency enables better planning for companies considering similar applications, though each case receives individual evaluation based on specific merits and risks.

This decision follows a confidential settlement agreement, effectively concluding a high-stakes legal battle centered on the Gemini Earn crypto lending program. The SEC had previously accused Gemini and its partner, Genesis Global Capital, of selling unregistered securities to retail investors. This resolution marks a pivotal moment for regulatory clarity in the digital asset space, potentially influencing future enforcement actions and industry practices. SEC Lawsuit Against Gemini: A Detailed Case Breakdown The SEC’s lawsuit against Gemini, filed in January 2023, represented a major enforcement action. The agency’s core allegation was that the Gemini Earn program constituted an offer and sale of unregistered securities. Specifically, the SEC argued that the interest-bearing accounts offered through Earn were investment contracts under the Howey Test. This legal framework determines what qualifies as a security. Investors loaned their crypto assets to Genesis through Gemini’s platform. In return, they received a promise of variable interest payments. The SEC contended this arrangement met the criteria of an investment contract because investors provided capital with an expectation of profits derived from the efforts of Genesis. Consequently, the agency asserted Gemini and Genesis should have registered the offering with the SEC. This failure to register, the lawsuit claimed, deprived investors of crucial disclosures about risks and operations. The Genesis Connection and Broader Context This case was intrinsically linked to the November 2022 collapse of the FTX exchange, which triggered a “crypto winter.” Genesis, a major crypto lender and Gemini’s partner in the Earn program, suspended withdrawals shortly after FTX’s failure. This action froze approximately $900 million in assets belonging to 340,000 Earn users. The SEC’s lawsuit against both entities followed this liquidity crisis. It highlighted the interconnected risks within the crypto lending ecosystem. Furthermore, the case occurred against a backdrop of increasing SEC scrutiny on crypto staking and lending services. For instance, the SEC had previously settled similar charges with BlockFi Lending LLC. The Gemini case was seen as a test of the agency’s authority over certain decentralized finance (DeFi) adjacent products offered by centralized platforms. Anatomy of the Settlement and Its Immediate Impacts The terms of the settlement between the SEC and Gemini remain confidential. However, such resolutions typically involve the defendant neither admitting nor denying the allegations while agreeing to certain conditions. Potential conditions could include a financial penalty, a cease-and-desist order from future violations, or operational changes. For Gemini, the immediate impact is the removal of a major legal overhang and significant legal costs. The settlement allows the company to focus on its core exchange business and customer restitution efforts related to the frozen Earn assets. For the SEC, the settlement represents a successful enforcement outcome without the uncertainty of a protracted trial. It reinforces the agency’s stance that certain crypto yield products are securities. The resolution also avoids setting a potentially unfavorable legal precedent had the courts ruled against the SEC’s interpretation. Key outcomes of the settlement include: Legal Closure: Gemini avoids a potentially damaging court verdict. Regulatory Precedent: The SEC secures another settlement affirming its jurisdiction. Investor Focus: Attention may shift to ongoing bankruptcy proceedings for Genesis to recover user funds. Market Signal: Other crypto platforms offering similar products may reassess their compliance strategies. Timeline: SEC Action Against Gemini Earn Date Event Feb 2021 Gemini Earn program launches in partnership with Genesis. Nov 2022 Genesis halts withdrawals following FTX collapse, freezing Earn user assets. Jan 2023 SEC files lawsuit against Gemini and Genesis for selling unregistered securities. Jan 2024 Genesis reaches a separate $21 million settlement with the SEC. [Date] 2025 SEC announces settlement and drops lawsuit against Gemini. Expert Analysis on Regulatory Implications Legal and industry experts view this settlement as a critical data point in the evolving crypto regulatory landscape. “This settlement underscores the SEC’s continued application of the Howey Test to crypto lending,” notes a former SEC enforcement attorney specializing in digital assets. “While it doesn’t create new law, it reinforces the agency’s view that platforms cannot bypass securities registration by offering yield on digital assets.” The settlement may accelerate a trend toward more explicit regulatory frameworks. Some experts argue it highlights the need for clearer rules from Congress, rather than regulation through enforcement. Conversely, others see it as a necessary step to protect investors in a novel and risky asset class. The outcome may push crypto businesses to seek explicit regulatory approvals, such as operating as a registered broker-dealer or under a new special-purpose charter, before launching yield-bearing products. The Path Forward for Crypto Compliance Following this settlement, crypto platforms are likely to intensify their compliance reviews. The case provides a clear warning about offering products that could be deemed investment contracts. Companies may now prioritize one of several paths: discontinuing such products in the U.S., aggressively pursuing registration, or fundamentally restructuring products to avoid classification as a security. This could involve changing marketing language, altering the source of yield, or implementing stricter decentralization. The settlement also keeps the spotlight on the ongoing debate about which digital assets are commodities versus securities. This distinction remains central to the jurisdictional divide between the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Conclusion The SEC’s decision to drop its lawsuit against Gemini following a settlement concludes a defining chapter in crypto regulation. This resolution over the Gemini Earn program reinforces the regulatory principle that offering returns on crypto assets may constitute a securities offering. It provides a measure of closure for Gemini while affirming the SEC’s enforcement posture. Ultimately, the settlement emphasizes the growing imperative for clear compliance in the digital asset industry. As the market evolves, this case will likely serve as a key reference point for platforms navigating the complex intersection of innovation and investor protection. FAQs Q1: What was the SEC lawsuit against Gemini about? The SEC sued Gemini (and Genesis) alleging that its Gemini Earn program involved the sale of unregistered securities. The agency claimed the interest-bearing accounts were investment contracts that required registration with the SEC. Q2: Why did the SEC drop the lawsuit? The SEC dropped the lawsuit after reaching a confidential settlement agreement with Gemini. Such settlements typically involve the defendant agreeing to certain terms, like a penalty, without admitting guilt, allowing both parties to avoid a trial. Q3: Does this mean Gemini Earn was legal? No. A settlement is not a ruling on legality. It ends the legal dispute without a court deciding whether the product violated securities laws. The SEC’s allegation of selling unregistered securities was not proven in court, nor was it dismissed. Q4: What happens to the money frozen in Gemini Earn? The settlement with the SEC is separate from the bankruptcy proceedings of Genesis. Recovery of the approximately $900 million in frozen user assets is being handled through Genesis’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy case in court. Q5: How does this affect other crypto lending platforms? This settlement signals the SEC’s continued focus on crypto yield products. Other platforms offering similar services may face increased regulatory scrutiny and might need to reassess their compliance strategies, potentially seeking registration or altering their product structures.

In an interview with Gatecast, the Strategy executive chairman argued the firm’s shift toward perpetual preferred equity and “digital credit” instruments is designed to fund continuous bitcoin accumulation while stripping out refinancing risk. Saylor traced the company’s pivot to the COVID-era shock of 2020, when “the physical economy of the world came to a grinding halt and the financial system was turned upside down.” Facing what he framed as an existential decision, he said Strategy discovered Bitcoin during “the war on COVID and the war on currency,” and used it to “escape a pretty miserable existence and turned into something digital and modern and much better.” Strategy Is Building A ‘Central Bank of Bitcoin’ That transformation now sits on a scale Saylor claims is often misunderstood. Addressing criticism that Strategy is simply levering up to buy more Bitcoin, he said the firm has raised roughly $44 billion over the past year and a half and characterized “most of that” as equity rather than debt. “There isn’t really leverage,” Saylor said. “Equity is capital that you have forever. We’re funneling that capital into the crypto economy. We’re buying Bitcoin.” He added that Strategy has acquired “about $48 billion worth of Bitcoin” across “like 88 different transactions,” purchasing “as soon as we raise the capital.” When asked whether Strategy is still just a buyer or something closer to a “shadow central bank of Bitcoin” given its holdings, Saylor leaned into the analogy. “Bitcoin is digital capital. It is the world reserve capital network. It’s replaced gold as the global non-sovereign store of value for the human race,” he said. Then came the framing: “Banks normally buy credit. We actually sell credit. So what we’re doing is the reverse of commercial banking, retail banking. It is sort of like central banking. We are sort of like the central bank of Bitcoin.” Saylor’s “central bank” claim hinges on a product stack meant to translate Bitcoin’s balance-sheet asset into yield-bearing instruments for investors who won’t hold BTC directly. He described STRC as “a currency that’s pegged to the dollar” and “backed with Bitcoin,” with proceeds recycled into BTC purchases. In his telling, that mechanism links “the Bitcoin economy” to “the traditional finance economy and to the money markets of the world.” Michael Saylor: “We are sort of like the central bank of Bitcoin.” pic.twitter.com/IyZ9EHLAQn — TFTC (@TFTC21) January 22, 2026 The more material shift, he argued, is Strategy’s progression away from maturity-driven debt toward perpetual structures. Saylor laid out a four-stage evolution: initial use of credit and leverage, a senior note secured by BTC collateral that the company later refinanced and vowed not to repeat, then non-recourse convertible bonds, an approach he said became constrained by market size and retail inaccessibility and finally “digital credit,” which he described as “an equity […]a perpetual preferred equity.” In one of his clearest statements of intent, Saylor said Strategy’s priority is to prevent principal from ever coming due. “We don’t want to have leverage. We want to have amplification via equity. We never want the principal to come due. We’d rather pay a higher dividend forever,” he said. “I’d rather pay 10% forever than pay 5% for 5 years.” Strategy, he added, has “announced a $1.44 billion cash reserve for the dividends,” giving it “the option to not raise any capital in the capital markets for up to two years,” and in his view “effectively stripped the credit risk off of the business.” Saylor also pitched liquidity as a differentiator. He said Strategy has raised $7 billion over the last nine months via these instruments and described an emerging market of about $8 billion outstanding. Where preferred stocks typically trade thinly, he argued Strategy’s “digital credit instruments were trading 30 million a day,” with “ Stretch […] more than a hundred million a day,” which he framed as a step-change in market access. The firm’s investor pitch, as Saylor described it, splits the world into capital and credit buyers. “Bitcoin is digital capital. The world will be built on digital capital. But the world will run on digital credit,” he said, arguing that products like Stretch can offer a money-market-like alternative “powered by digital capital” while sidestepping Bitcoin’s volatility.

Crypto commentator X Finance Bull argues that the groundwork for large-scale adoption has already been laid and that regulatory clarity is the final condition required to unlock substantial demand for XRP . According to his assessment, major banks are not hesitating due to technical limitations or lack of interest, but because they are waiting for formal rules that allow them to engage fully with digital assets. The argument centers on the idea that financial institutions have spent years preparing their infrastructure behind the scenes. Once legislation governing market structure is finalized, X Finance Bull suggests that these institutions will move quickly to announce their participation, including the use of XRP for liquidity and settlement purposes. In his view, this shift would fundamentally change how early and late market participants are defined.

Institutions that… pic.twitter.com/ROopRj21vW — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) January 22, 2026 Banks Positioned Ahead of Market Structure Approval X Finance Bull emphasizes that banks are already positioned for entry, rather than evaluating whether to enter at all. He frames the current period as a pause rather than a rejection, driven by compliance requirements and regulatory uncertainty. From this perspective, the passage of market structure rules is not an abstract policy issue but a practical green light for institutions that have been waiting for legal certainty. This interpretation aligns with recent public commentary from policymakers and advisors close to the White House. In a CNBC interview referenced alongside the post, White House crypto and AI advisor David Sacks indicated that once market structure legislation is in place, banks are expected to integrate into the crypto industry rather than operate in a separate or parallel system. X Finance Bull presents this as confirmation that institutional entry is anticipated at the highest levels of policy discussion. Ripple Infrastructure and XRP Liquidity Highlighted Another central point in the commentary is the distinction between infrastructure readiness and market participation. X Finance Bull states that Ripple already has the necessary technology stack in place, while XRP provides the liquidity component needed for institutional-scale transactions. From his perspective, the payment rails are complete, removing operational barriers that might otherwise delay adoption once regulatory approval is secured. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He further argues that this readiness places XRP in a unique position compared to other digital assets that may still be developing or testing their institutional use cases. The expectation is that once rules are finalized, institutions that have remained quiet over the past several years will publicly confirm both purchases and active usage of XRP. Long-Term Conviction Over Short-Term Volatility X Finance Bull also contrasts long-term research-driven conviction with short-term market reactions. He presents the recent selling pressure as inconsistent with the broader institutional narrative he describes, questioning the rationale behind investors’ decision to abandon positions when banks are preparing to increase their exposure. According to his evaluation, the upcoming regulatory decisions will reset market perception, redefining who can be deemed an early adopter of the asset. In general, the commentary asserts that the regulatory market structure is the critical action that could transform years of preparation into tangible demand for XRP. Banks are well-positioned to make a decisive move once the legal structure is established. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

This legislative move specifically targets potential conflicts of interest for President Donald Trump and other high-ranking officials. Consequently, the proposal marks a pivotal moment in the intersection of digital finance and government ethics. Presidential Crypto Ban Proposal Emerges in Senate Committee The Senate Agriculture Committee will soon discuss the proposed amendment to the CLARITY bill. This provision would prohibit the president, vice president, and all members of Congress from conducting financial transactions using digital assets. The Block first reported this development ahead of scheduled committee deliberations. Meanwhile, Bloomberg previously estimated that President Trump earned approximately $1.4 billion from crypto-related ventures. These ventures notably include the stablecoin initiative World Liberty Financial. This legislative action follows increasing scrutiny of political figures’ cryptocurrency holdings. Government ethics experts have repeatedly warned about potential conflicts. The proposed ban represents a direct response to these growing concerns. Furthermore, it establishes a clear precedent for regulating officials’ financial activities in emerging digital markets. Historical Context of Cryptocurrency Regulation in Politics Political involvement with digital assets has evolved significantly over the past decade. Initially, few regulations addressed cryptocurrency holdings for elected officials. However, several high-profile cases prompted congressional attention. For instance, former officials faced criticism for promoting specific tokens. Additionally, some lawmakers reported substantial crypto investments in financial disclosures. The current proposal builds upon existing financial ethics laws. The STOCK Act of 2012 already restricts traditional securities trading. Nevertheless, digital assets remained largely unaddressed until now. The table below illustrates key regulatory milestones: Year Regulatory Action Impact on Digital Assets 2012 STOCK Act Passage Restricted stock trading; excluded cryptocurrencies 2021 First Crypto Disclosure Rules Required reporting of digital asset holdings 2023 SEC Enforcement Actions Targeted celebrity endorsements of tokens 2025 CLARITY Bill Proposal Seeks complete transaction ban for officials This legislative timeline demonstrates the gradual regulatory approach. Each step addressed emerging concerns about market manipulation and conflicts. The current proposal represents the most restrictive measure yet considered. Expert Analysis of the Proposed Restrictions Financial ethics specialists have offered mixed reactions to the proposed ban. Dr. Eleanor Vance, a government ethics professor at Georgetown University, explained the rationale. “Public officials must avoid even the appearance of impropriety,” she stated. “Cryptocurrency markets present unique challenges because of their volatility and transparency issues.” Conversely, some blockchain advocates criticize the approach. Michael Chen, director of the Digital Governance Institute, expressed concerns. “Blanket bans may discourage technological understanding among policymakers,” Chen argued. “Instead, we need transparent disclosure systems and clear guidelines.” The proposal includes several key provisions: Complete transaction prohibition for president, vice president, and Congress members Coverage of all digital assets including cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and tokens Immediate implementation upon bill passage with no grandfathering Enforcement through existing ethics committees with standard penalty structures Market and Political Implications of the Crypto Ban The proposed legislation could significantly impact both cryptocurrency markets and political dynamics. Market analysts note potential effects on investor confidence. Some experts suggest restrictions might reduce perceived political manipulation risks. However, others warn about creating a two-tier system separating officials from constituents. Politically, the proposal has generated partisan reactions. Democratic supporters emphasize ethical governance and public trust. Republican critics describe the measure as politically motivated. They particularly question its timing amid election cycles. Nevertheless, bipartisan support exists for some form of regulation. International observers also monitor these developments closely. Several governments consider similar restrictions for their officials. The U.S. proposal could establish a global precedent. Consequently, foreign legislative bodies might adopt comparable measures. Constitutional and Legal Considerations Legal scholars debate the proposal’s constitutional dimensions. Some question whether Congress can restrict the president’s personal financial activities. However, precedent exists for such limitations. Historical ethics laws have consistently applied to all government branches. The Supreme Court has previously upheld reasonable restrictions on officials’ conduct. These restrictions aim to prevent conflicts and maintain public confidence. Therefore, legal experts generally expect the proposal to withstand constitutional challenges. Still, specific implementation details might face judicial scrutiny. Conclusion The proposed presidential crypto ban represents a landmark moment in digital asset regulation. Senate Democrats seek to address genuine ethical concerns through the CLARITY bill amendment. This initiative responds to substantial cryptocurrency earnings reported by political figures. Moreover, it establishes clear boundaries for officials’ participation in emerging financial markets. The coming Senate Agriculture Committee discussions will determine the proposal’s fate. Regardless of outcome, this debate highlights growing recognition of cryptocurrency’s political dimensions. Ultimately, the presidential crypto ban discussion reflects broader efforts to modernize government ethics for the digital age. FAQs Q1: What exactly does the proposed presidential crypto ban prohibit? The amendment would prohibit the president, vice president, and members of Congress from conducting any financial transactions using digital assets, including buying, selling, or trading cryptocurrencies and tokens. Q2: Why are Democrats proposing this ban now? The proposal follows reports estimating substantial cryptocurrency earnings by political figures and aims to address potential conflicts of interest before they affect policy decisions or market stability. Q3: How would this ban be enforced if passed? Existing congressional ethics committees and executive branch oversight bodies would enforce the prohibition using standard penalty structures already established for other financial ethics violations. Q4: Does this ban apply to cryptocurrency holdings acquired before the law? The current proposal includes no grandfathering provisions, meaning officials would need to divest existing cryptocurrency holdings or place them in blind trusts upon the law’s implementation. Q5: How have cryptocurrency markets reacted to this proposal? Initial market reactions have been muted, as most analysts expected some form of political regulation, though specific price movements may follow congressional committee discussions and voting.

This venture, headquartered in Paris, represents a pivotal and ambitious shift in AI research, moving beyond language models toward systems that genuinely comprehend and interact with the physical world. The announcement, confirmed in October 2025, signals a new chapter for European tech and the future of machine intelligence. Decoding AMI Labs and the World Model Vision AMI Labs, standing for Advanced Machine Intelligence, has formally disclosed its mission to develop ‘world models.’ Consequently, this approach aims to create AI systems with a robust, persistent understanding of real-world physics, cause and effect, and common sense. Unlike large language models (LLMs) that process text, world models seek to emulate how humans and animals learn through observation and interaction. Therefore, this research direction tackles core limitations of current AI, such as hallucinations and a lack of true reasoning. Yann LeCun, the company’s executive chairman, has been a vocal critic of relying solely on LLMs for artificial general intelligence. He argues that real intelligence starts with perceiving the world, not with language. Accordingly, AMI’s technology promises AI with persistent memory, advanced planning capabilities, and enhanced safety and controllability. This focus makes it particularly suited for high-stakes applications where reliability is non-negotiable. The Leadership and Strategic Backing Behind the Startup A critical detail in AMI’s structure is its leadership team. While LeCun provides the visionary research direction, Alex LeBrun serves as CEO. LeBrun previously co-founded and led Nabla, a health AI startup. His transition was part of a strategic partnership where Nabla gained privileged access to AMI’s world models. Furthermore, Laurent Solly, former Meta Vice President for Europe, has also joined the venture. This team combines deep AI research expertise with seasoned entrepreneurial and operational experience. Investor interest has been intense, reflecting the high stakes of this technological race. Reports from Bloomberg indicate that venture capital firms like Cathay Innovation, Greycroft, and Hiro Capital are in talks. Other potential backers include 20VC, Bpifrance, Daphni, and HV Capital. The rumored $3.5 billion pre-launch valuation underscores the market’s belief in LeCun’s thesis and the team’s ability to execute it. A Contrarian Bet in a Crowded AI Landscape AMI Labs enters a competitive field but with a distinctly different philosophy. Its direct rival, World Labs, founded by AI pioneer Fei-Fei Li, recently achieved unicorn status and is reportedly seeking a $5 billion valuation after launching its 3D world-generating product, Marble. However, AMI’s strategy is not merely to generate digital worlds but to build models that understand and reason about the real one. This foundational research could underpin advancements in numerous applied fields. LeCun has suggested that Meta, his former employer, could become AMI’s first client. This potential collaboration highlights the ongoing exchange between foundational academic research and large-scale industrial application. Despite this, LeCun has maintained his academic role at NYU, ensuring a continued pipeline of talent and open research contributions through publications and open-source releases. Paris as the New Global AI Epicenter The choice of Paris for AMI Labs’ headquarters is a significant geopolitical and technological statement. French President Emmanuel Macron publicly welcomed the decision, pledging government support. This move consolidates Paris’s position as a leading AI hub, joining other notable entities like H, Mistral AI, and Meta’s own FAIR lab. The startup will also maintain offices in Montreal, New York, and Singapore, reflecting its global ambitions from inception. This development is a major boost for the European tech ecosystem. It demonstrates the region’s capacity to attract and retain top-tier AI talent and command valuations competitive with Silicon Valley. The presence of such a high-profile research-driven company could catalyze further investment, startup formation, and policy focus within the EU’s digital strategy. Target Industries and the Path to Application AMI Labs has identified several critical sectors for its technology. Unsurprisingly, healthcare is a primary target, given CEO Alex LeBrun’s background at Nabla. In clinical settings, reliable, non-hallucinatory AI could revolutionize diagnostics, treatment planning, and patient monitoring. Beyond healthcare, the startup’s mission statement highlights industrial process control, automation, robotics, and wearable devices. The company plans to license its world model technology to industry partners for real-world applications. This B2B model allows AMI to focus on core research while ensuring its work solves concrete problems. The emphasis on safety and controllability is not just a technical feature but a prerequisite for adoption in these sensitive, high-liability domains. Conclusion Yann LeCun’s AMI Labs represents a fundamental and thrilling pivot in artificial intelligence. By championing world models over pure language models, the startup is betting on a more robust, reliable, and ultimately more intelligent path to AI. Backed by a stellar team, significant investor interest, and the support of the French government, AMI Labs is poised to become a central player in shaping the next decade of AI. Its success or failure will not only validate a key research direction but also signal Europe’s enduring role in defining the future of global technology. FAQs Q1: What are ‘world models’ in AI? A1: World models are AI systems designed to understand and simulate the rules, physics, and cause-and-effect relationships of the real world. They aim to give AI common sense and the ability to plan and reason based on a persistent internal model of reality, moving beyond pattern recognition in text or images. Q2: Why did Yann LeCun leave Meta to start AMI Labs? A2: While maintaining ties, LeCun left to pursue his specific research vision for ‘world models’ independently. He has expressed criticism of an over-reliance on LLMs and sought to build a company dedicated to his alternative architectural approach for achieving more reliable and capable machine intelligence. Q3: Who is funding AMI Labs? A3: While not officially closed, reports indicate venture capital firms like Cathay Innovation, Greycroft, and Hiro Capital are in advanced talks. The startup is rumored to be seeking funding at a valuation of approximately $3.5 billion, highlighting massive investor confidence. Q4: What is the difference between AMI Labs and World Labs? A4: Both focus on world models, but with different emphases. World Labs, founded by Fei-Fei Li, has launched a product (Marble) for generating 3D environments. AMI Labs, led by LeCun, is focused on foundational research to build general-purpose models that understand real-world physics for applications in healthcare, robotics, and industry. Q5: How will AMI Labs’ technology be used? A5: The company plans to license its world model technology to partners in sectors where AI reliability is critical. Primary target fields include healthcare for clinical decision support, industrial automation for process control, robotics for complex task planning, and next-generation wearable devices.

57423978,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=901181,1769214734,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/57423978.jpeg,Remittances take priority over aid as Africa turns to stablecoins,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/africa-turns-to-stablecoins/,"Stablecoins have emerged quickly as a faster and cheaper tool for sending money across Africa, with remittances now considered “more important than aid,” former UN under-secretary-general Vera Songwe says. On Thursday, at a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Songwe emphasized the steep cost of traditional money transfers in the continent, which can reach roughly $6 for every $100 sent, slowing cross-border payments and making them very costly. “Stablecoins are lowering fees and settlement times, allowing people and small businesses to transfer money in minutes, not days,” she said. Songwe also emphasized the financial security that stablecoins can offer in countries struggling with high inflation . Since the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation has exceeded 20% in “about 12 to 15 countries” across Africa, she noted. With 650 million people on the continent lacking access to a bank account, stablecoins allow users with just a smartphone to save in currencies less vulnerable to inflation. According to Songwe, stablecoin adoption is strongest in Egypt, Nigeria, Ethiopia, and South Africa, where inflation is high or capital controls are strict. Most transactions are conducted by small- and medium-sized enterprises, showing that stablecoins are increasingly functioning as a tool for broad financial inclusion. Songwe chairs the Liquidity and Sustainability Facility and is a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. She previously served as executive secretary of the UN Economic Commission for Africa. Stablecoins drive Africa’s digital finance revolution For a while, Africa has been touted as the region that benefits most from digital assets and blockchain technology. However, activity in the region has been the lowest globally, and blockchain adoption has also failed to blow up as expected. This is now changing, and stablecoins are at the forefront of this transformation. Africans prioritize utility over speculation, and now, with stablecoins, payments, hedging against local currency depreciation, and cross-border transfers are easier and faster than ever. Recent reports revealed that Africa leads the stablecoin sector with a 9.3% adoption rate. The report ranked Nigeria first globally, with 25.9 million users, representing 12% of the population. “Stablecoins have become an increasingly critical tool for Africans seeking more efficient and accessible financial solutions,” the report stated. Africa’s embrace of stablecoins didn’t happen overnight; it’s been building over the past few years. With the value of most local currencies depreciating—the naira, for instance, has lost 73% of its value against the USD over the past three years—Africans have turned to stablecoins as a hedge. Millions more have been using stablecoins to send and receive funds from overseas. Crypto adoption accelerates across Africa Crypto adoption is accelerating across Africa, with national responses increasingly diverging. Sub-Saharan Africa saw more than $205 billion in on-chain transactions between July 2024 and June 2025, a 52% year-over-year increase, ranking it third globally, according to a Chainalysis report. Some countries are beginning to embrace regulation: In December, Ghana legalized cryptocurrency trading with the passage of the Virtual Asset Service Providers bill, empowering authorities with risk management measures while facilitating crypto activity. Nigeria enacted rules on January 13 that compel crypto providers to match transactions to users’ tax identification numbers, ushering digital asset activity into the formal tax system. South Africa has also pointed out crypto assets and stablecoins as rising financial stability risks, even as local adoption continues to expand. As the continent’s crypto landscape evolves, stablecoins look ideally positioned to play a key role in enhancing financial inclusion and accelerating payments, offering a hedge against volatile local currencies.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, a widely monitored barometer of investor psychology, has inched upward to a score of 25. Despite this minor gain, the index firmly remains in the “Extreme Fear” territory, highlighting the persistent anxiety clouding digital asset investments. This reading, recorded on April 10, 2025, follows a period of significant market turbulence and regulatory scrutiny worldwide. Decoding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Score of 25 The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a crucial thermometer for market emotion. Developed by data provider Alternative, it quantifies sentiment on a scale from 0 to 100. A score of 0 represents maximum fear, while 100 signifies unbridled greed. The current score of 25, though a one-point improvement from the previous day, sits deep within the red zone defined as “Extreme Fear.” This metric is not a simple survey; it is a composite index derived from multiple market data points. The calculation incorporates six core components, each weighted to reflect its influence on overall sentiment. Volatility (25%): Measures price swings, with high volatility often correlating with fear. Market Volume (25%): Analyzes trading activity; suppressed volume can indicate investor hesitation. Social Media (15%): Tracks sentiment and volume of discussion on platforms like Twitter and Reddit. Surveys (15%): Incorporates data from periodic polls of market participants. Dominance (10%): Assesses Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. Trends (10%): Evaluates search interest via platforms like Google Trends. Therefore, the index provides a multi-faceted, data-driven snapshot of collective market psychology. Historical Context and Market Impact of Extreme Fear Understanding the significance of a score of 25 requires examining historical patterns. The index has fluctuated dramatically since its inception. For instance, it plummeted to single digits during the market capitulation events of late 2022. Conversely, it soared above 80 during the bull market peaks of 2021. Periods of “Extreme Fear” have historically presented complex dynamics for investors. On one hand, they often coincide with market bottoms or consolidation phases, potentially signaling a buying opportunity for contrarian investors. On the other hand, prolonged fear can lead to reduced liquidity, suppressed asset prices, and a general slowdown in ecosystem development and investment. Recent Crypto Fear & Greed Index Milestones Date Index Score Sentiment Key Market Event Nov 2021 84 Extreme Greed Bitcoin All-Time High (~$69,000) Jun 2022 6 Extreme Fear Terra/LUNA Collapse Aftermath Jan 2023 31 Fear Market Recovery Begins Apr 2025 25 Extreme Fear Current Reading Market analysts frequently compare current readings to these historical benchmarks to gauge relative sentiment. Expert Analysis on the Current Sentiment Landscape Financial analysts point to several concurrent factors sustaining the extreme fear sentiment. Firstly, macroeconomic uncertainty regarding interest rates and inflation continues to pressure risk assets globally. Secondly, the regulatory environment for digital assets remains in flux across major economies like the United States and the European Union, creating hesitation among institutional investors. Thirdly, on-chain data shows a reduction in active addresses and network activity for several major blockchains, indicating lower retail participation. Experts from firms like Glassnode and CoinMetrics often correlate these on-chain metrics with sentiment index readings to build a more complete picture. They note that while fear dominates, the slight uptick to 25 could suggest the initial phase of panic selling has subsided, potentially giving way to a period of cautious accumulation or sideways movement. The Role of Bitcoin Dominance in Sentiment Calculation Bitcoin’s market cap dominance, accounting for 10% of the index, plays a pivotal role. Currently, a high dominance figure often reflects a “flight to safety” within crypto, where investors move capital from altcoins into Bitcoin, perceived as a more established store of value during turmoil. This behavior directly feeds into the fear metric. Conversely, when dominance falls and altcoins gain market share, it typically signals higher risk appetite and greed. The interplay between Bitcoin’s price stability, its dominance ratio, and the broader index score is a critical relationship for traders to monitor. Recent data shows dominance holding at elevated levels, reinforcing the risk-off narrative captured by the Extreme Fear reading. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading of 25 offers a clear, quantitative measure of the prevailing market mood. It confirms that despite a marginal daily improvement, extreme fear continues to govern cryptocurrency investor sentiment. This environment, shaped by macro pressures, regulatory developments, and technical market factors, presents both challenges and opportunities. Historically, such periods have preceded significant market inflection points. For market participants, this index serves as a vital tool for contextualizing price action within the broader spectrum of human emotion and market structure, reminding everyone that data-driven analysis is crucial in navigating the volatile crypto landscape. FAQs Q1: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 25 mean? It indicates the market is in a state of “Extreme Fear.” The scale runs from 0 (maximum fear) to 100 (maximum greed), placing 25 deep within the fear zone, suggesting high investor anxiety and risk aversion. Q2: Who creates the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and how is it calculated? Data provider Alternative.me calculates the index. It uses six weighted factors: volatility (25%), trading volume (25%), social media (15%), surveys (15%), Bitcoin dominance (10%), and search trends (10%). Q3: Is extreme fear always bad for cryptocurrency investors? Not necessarily. While it indicates negative sentiment and often lower prices, extreme fear has historically sometimes marked potential buying opportunities for long-term investors, as prices may be undervalued relative to future potential. Q4: How often does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index update? The index updates daily, providing a near real-time snapshot of shifting market sentiment based on the previous 24 hours of data. Q5: Can the index predict future Bitcoin or crypto prices? The index is a sentiment indicator, not a direct price predictor. It shows current market emotion, which can be a contrarian signal at extremes. However, prices are influenced by many other fundamental and technical factors beyond sentiment alone.

The watchdog dropped the case against the company. This move ended one of the most closely watched crypto enforcement cases, which emerged from the 2022 market collapse. In a joint filing submitted on Friday, the SEC and Gemini asked a federal court to dismiss the case with prejudice. This means that the agency cannot bring the same claims again. The long-running case had been pending since January 2023. It also marks the closure of another major legal battle over the digital assets industry under the Trump rule. Gemini is run by twin founders Tyler Winklevoss and Cameron Winklevoss. SEC ends Gemini Earn case but warns others According to the release, the SEC stated that its decision was an exercise of discretion. It cited the 100 percent in-kind return of crypto assets to Gemini Earn customers. However, it also pointed to prior state and regulatory settlements tied to the program. Meanwhile, the agency suggested that this dismissal does not send any sort of shift in enforcement policy. The filing said the decision does not reflect the SEC’s position in other cases. This involves crypto lending or yield products. The Gemini Earn program was launched in February 2021. It granted users to earn yield by lending crypto assets to Genesis Global Capital. Gemini was acting as the front end and charged fees from users. Later, Genesis froze withdrawals in November 2022. This move followed the collapse of FTX which triggered a massive liquidity crisis in the crypto market. Under Gemini Earn, customers lent bitcoin and other tokens to Genesis . In return, they received interest payments where Gemini earned fees that reached as high as 4.29%. Gemini has said customers were informed of risks. It has maintained that Genesis was responsible for the lending decisions and losses. Genesis said it could not meet redemption requests. This resulted in more than $900 million in customer assets being locked at the time. Around 340,000 Gemini Earn users were affected due to the halt. However, Genesis filed for bankruptcy two months later. Genesis settlement The SEC came into action and sued Gemini and Genesis in January 2023. The agency alleged the companies sold unregistered securities to retail investors. It argued that Gemini Earn functioned as an investment contract under federal law. Gemini denied the allegations and said that Earn was a lending arrangement and not a securities offering. However, Genesis did not contest the facts but later reached a separate settlement. Genesis reportedly agreed to pay a $21 million civil penalty. It did so without admitting or denying wrongdoing. The settlement between the SEC and Gemini did not resolved the claims. Both parties showed some progress in September 2025. The agency agreed in principle to settle the case. Lawyers for both sides said the agreement would fully resolve the dispute, subject to commission approval. The settlement disclosure in the case came days after Gemini completed an initial public offering. The exchange raised $425 million and the IPO valued the company at about $3.3 billion. After months of negotiations, Gemini Earn customers eventually recovered their assets. The recovery was completed in kind rather than in cash. That outcome weighed heavily in the SEC’s decision to dismiss the case.

However, the margin for error is thin. As price hovers near key levels, $63 has emerged as the line bulls must protect. A break below it could shift momentum sharply, while holding above keeps the broader bullish structure alive and sets the stage for the next decisive move. Structure Gives Way, Expansion Phase Begins Columbus’s latest LTC update highlights that the multi-year compression that previously capped price action has finally resolved, resulting in a clean break of the long-term chart setup. This structural change confirms a shift from a neutral state to a clearly bullish one. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Litecoin Price May Be Getting Ready For Another Massive Rally The current price action is described as a pause before expansion rather than the conclusion of the rally. In this phase, Litecoin is holding steady above old resistance levels, allowing the market to load for the next leg of the move, turning previous barriers into new support. Litecoin’s projected path forward is based on the typical behavior of expansion cycles following structural breaks. The strategy follows a clear three-step progression: the initial breakout, followed by the current phase of acceptance. Once the market fully accepts these new price levels, the “real move” begins, representing a phase where the most significant gains are expected to materialize. The 9-Year Trendline That Still Controls Litecoin Matthew Dixon highlighted the immense historical significance of the Litecoin long-term trend line. This line has acted as an unbreakable floor for nine years, with the price never closing below it. While the market has dipped under this line multiple times in the past, every attempt to break down has ultimately failed, maintaining a remarkably consistent structural defense. Related Reading: Litecoin Follows Bitcoin’s Momentum, But Resistance Looms At $79.60 Currently, the market environment is putting this nearly decade-long support to the test once again. Dixon emphasizes that we cannot rely on intra-month volatility to determine the outcome. Instead, the definitive signal rests solely on the monthly candle close. This closing price will serve as a macro-economic pivot point that dictates the primary direction for the coming months. A successful hold above the trend line would be a powerful bullish confirmation, suggesting the long-term uptrend remains intact despite external pressures. Conversely, a confirmed close below this line would shift the narrative to bearish, marking a historic breakdown of a nine-year support system. Specific technical triggers are also in play, particularly the $63 level. Dixon warns that falling below $63 would be devastating, as it would effectively nullify the hidden bullish divergence currently supporting the price. Given these risks, Dixon recommends exercising patience until the monthly close or ensuring strict stop losses are in place for any active trades.

Trading kicked off amid a mix of curiosity and caution, with on-chain data already showing how much the DOGE ETF has performed so far. 21Shares Launches Dogecoin ETF In a press release on Thursday, January 22, 21Shares announced the official launch of its Spot Dogecoin ETF, TDOG, which began trading on NASDAQ the same day. The new ETF provides investors with direct exposure to Dogecoin through a fully backed, regulated, and transparent vehicle. Each ETF share is also backed 1:1 by DOGE held in institutional-grade custody. Notably, the launch of the new TDOG ETF brings the total number of US Dogecoin ETFs to three, joining Grayscale’s GDOG and Bitwise’s BWOW. 21Shares is also the only ETF provider endorsed by House of Doge , the official corporate arm of the Dogecoin foundation, highlighting the global asset manager’s close ties to the meme coin. As one of the largest crypto ETF issuers, 21Shares continues to expand its crypto product lineup with the introduction of TDOG. This follows the investment company’s previous ETF offerings, including TSOL, a Solana ETF released in November 2025; ARKB, a Spot Bitcoin ETF launched in January 2024; and TETH, an Ethereum ETF introduced in July of the same year. Together, these products demonstrate 21Shares’ commitment to providing institutional-grade access to high-demand digital assets. Federick Brokate, Global Head of Business Development at 21Shares, highlighted DOGE’s large and active global community, calling it a unique digital asset with constantly growing use cases. He added that the new TDOG ETF will give investors regulated, physically backed exposure through a familiar ETF structure they know and trust. Marco Margiotta, the CEO of House of Doge , also shared comments on the recently launched 21Shares ETF. He said that TDOG is a step toward making Dogecoin easier to access through traditional financial systems. He also disclosed that House of Doge’s partnership with 21Shares will help more people get involved as the Dogecoin ecosystem grows. How 21Shares Dogecoin ETF Has Performed So Far Contrary to expectations, 21Shares’ recently launched Dogecoin ETF saw weak performance on the first day of trading, signaling investors’ lack of interest in the investment product . Data from SoSoValue shows that TDOG experienced no inflows on January 22 and instead declined by about 0.07%. Despite it being the second day of trading, the DOGE ETF has still not registered any flows. This lackluster performance has been observed across all Dogecoin ETFs this week. Grayscales’ GDOG and Bitwise BWOW have reported zero inflows over the last week. The last time GDOG saw positive activity was on January 8, when it received around $333,083 in investments. Before that, the ETF recorded its highest inflows on January 2, totaling roughly $2.3 million. Since its launch in November 2025, GDOG ETF inflows have been unstable, with more days of inactivity than significant investment.",Dogecoin|21Shares|ARKB|Bitwise|BWOW|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin Ecosystem|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Federick Brokate|GDOG|Grayscales|House of Doge|Marco Margiotta|Nasdaq|Solana Spot ETF|Sosovalue|spot Bitcoin ETF|Spot Dogecoin ETF|Spot Ethereum ETF|TDOG|TETH|TSOL,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SPONSORED|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-24 01:00:34

Court filings show the parties jointly agreed to dismiss the case in the Southern District of New York. The dismissal still requires approval from a federal judge to become final. Once approved, the SEC will be permanently barred from bringing the same claims again. The lawsuit centered on Gemini’s Earn program, which allowed customers to lend crypto assets through Genesis. The SEC had alleged the program involved the sale of unregistered securities. The case was originally filed in January 2023 during a period of aggressive regulatory enforcement against crypto firms. The dismissal marks a significant legal victory for Gemini and the broader crypto industry. It also signals a shift in regulatory priorities under the current administration. Background of the Earn Program Gemini Earn allowed customers to earn interest by lending digital assets to Genesis. Genesis then used those assets for institutional lending and trading activities. The program collapsed following Genesis’s bankruptcy in 2022 after major market disruptions. Many investors feared they would never recover their funds. However, the bankruptcy process ultimately resulted in a 100% in-kind return of assets. The SEC cited this recovery as one reason it agreed to dismiss the case. Gemini also committed up to $40 million to support the full repayment of customers. The regulator acknowledged that customer harm had been effectively resolved. Genesis had already settled with the SEC earlier by paying a $21 million fine. That settlement removed Genesis from further litigation risk related to the case. Regulatory Shift Under New Leadership The SEC paused the Gemini lawsuit in April 2024 while Mark Uyeda was serving as acting chairman. The pause suggested the agency was reassessing its broader crypto enforcement strategy. Since the Trump administration took office in January 2025, several crypto cases have been dropped. The administration has publicly promised to reduce regulatory pressure on the digital asset sector. Gemini’s case adds to a growing list of abandoned lawsuits. Other firms benefiting from dismissals include Binance, Kraken, Uniswap, Immutable, and Robinhood. The trend signals a dramatic departure from the aggressive enforcement seen under the prior administration. Regulators now appear more focused on collaboration and clarity rather than punishment. This shift has been welcomed by much of the crypto industry. It has also improved investor confidence across digital asset markets. Impact on the Crypto Industry The dismissal provides reassurance that crypto lending programs may be revisited under clearer legal frameworks. Many companies paused innovation after facing legal uncertainty. With the SEC retreating from several major cases, development may accelerate again. Firms may feel more comfortable launching new financial products. The outcome also highlights the importance of bankruptcy resolution in regulatory negotiations. Returning customer funds played a decisive role in shaping the SEC’s decision. That sets a precedent for how similar cases might be handled in the future. It shows regulators are willing to compromise when investor losses are fully addressed. The case also reinforces the importance of compliance transparency. Crypto firms are expected to work more closely with regulators going forward. Broader Legal Developments The SEC is not the only agency pulling back from crypto litigation. The Department of Justice recently dismissed its NFT insider trading case against Nathaniel Chastain. That decision followed a federal appeals court reversal of his earlier convictions. The outcome further weakens the government’s recent track record in crypto prosecutions. Together, these dismissals indicate a cooling of legal hostilities toward digital assets. They suggest a more balanced regulatory environment may be emerging. For crypto companies, this represents a chance to rebuild trust and credibility. For investors, it offers greater confidence that the market is stabilizing legally. The Gemini dismissal may become a landmark moment in crypto regulation history. It could mark the beginning of a more cooperative era between regulators and innovators.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2026-01-24 01:01:28

According to Arthur, the previous year served a specific purpose for the industry. He argued that 2025 was largely defined by efforts to remove lingering obstacles created by earlier political and regulatory conditions, including unresolved lawsuits, inconsistent oversight, and structural weaknesses in market regulation. In his view, these issues weighed heavily on innovation and limited the ability of serious blockchain networks to operate at full capacity. Arthur’s comments suggest that this period of cleanup was necessary groundwork rather than a growth phase. He emphasized that uncertainty and hostile regulatory approaches had distorted market behavior, allowing speculation to dominate while practical use cases remained underdeveloped. 2026 as the Year of Activation Looking ahead, Arthur described 2026 as a fundamentally different phase for the sector. He characterized the coming year as one in which regulation, functional utility, real adoption, and genuine liquidity begin to align. Under this framework, blockchain networks integrated into financial systems would start to see measurable benefits, while speculative projects would struggle to remain relevant. Arthur argued that once regulation becomes clearer and institutional participation increases, the crypto market will no longer resemble its current form. He expressed the view that a large portion of existing projects, “up to 50%,” could disappear by the end of 2026, not due to controversy or market panic, but because they lack meaningful purpose or real-world application. Utility as the Driver of the Next Cycle Central to Arthur’s outlook is the belief that the next market cycle will be driven by utility rather than hype. He pointed to real-world problem solving, financial infrastructure, and settlement capabilities as the defining characteristics of the networks that will endure. In this context, he identified specific blockchain platforms that he believes are positioned to benefit from this shift, including XRP, Ethereum , Algorand, and HBAR , particularly those already being connected to global systems. Arthur warned that continued exposure to assets with no clear function carries increasing risk as the market matures. He maintained that regulatory clarity combined with operational utility will narrow the field, leaving only technologies that offer tangible value. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community Reaction and Liquidity Expectations The message resonated with some members of the community. One X user, Jalen, publicly agreed with Arthur’s assessment, adding that upcoming legislation could further accelerate liquidity entering the market once it is passed. While Jalen noted that this view was subjective, his comment aligned with Arthur’s broader argument that regulatory progress could unlock capital flows that have remained on the sidelines. Taken together, Arthur’s remarks present a clear thesis: the crypto market is moving away from speculation and toward practical implementation, and the assets that survive will be those built for real financial use rather than short-term narratives.

According to him, this is possible due to the surge in backing for the crypto industry from the United States under the leadership of Donald Trump. Hence, with other nations following this lead, CZ predicted that Bitcoin might evolve beyond its typical four-year cycle. Regarding this four-year cycle, analysts noted that it typically shows an increase in BTC’s price , followed by a drop after each halving event. Notably, being a dominant cryptocurrency in the market, once it moves, the rest of the market typically follows. CZ describes 2026 as a game-changer for Bitcoin’s price trend During an interview with CNBC’s anchor Andrew Ross Sorkin at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Binance’s founder declared that, “I strongly believe that 2026 will likely be a supercycle for Bitcoin.” Although he made this statement firmly, CZ failed to establish a specific price target for the cryptocurrency. On the other hand, other key crypto influencers shaping the industry did set a specific price target for Bitcoin. For instance, Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple, proposed a target of $180,000, while the co-founder of the BitMEX cryptocurrency exchange, Arthur Hayes, suggested a target of $200,000 for this year. Following this news, Zhao acknowledged that, “Looking at a 5-10 year timeframe, it’s quite easy to predict. We’re going to see an increase.” Meanwhile, sources with knowledge of the situation revealed that during Zhao’s talk with anchor Ross Sorkin, the former Binance CEO denied any relationship with Trump regarding crypto activities. Nonetheless, even with his assertion, some in the crypto industry suggest that CZ’s connection to the US president may have played a key role in persuading Trump to issue a pardon for the Binance co-founder last October. “There really isn’t any connection,” Zhao stated. “The only thing is that the Trump family is involved in crypto. Binance is a major crypto company, and the Trump administration supports crypto. That benefits all businesses in the crypto space.” Trump’s decision to pardon CZ raised suspicion among individuals Concerning Zhao’s relationship with Trump, reports highlighted that MGX, an investment firm from Abu Dhabi, allocated around $2 billion of its funds to Binance via the USD1 stablecoin , a fiat-backed, institutional-focused stablecoin issued and managed by the World Liberty Financial (WLFI) decentralized finance platform, backed by Donald Trump and family last year. This finding prompted reporters to reach out to CZ for comment on the alleged relationship. In response to this request, Zhao stressed that it was all a misunderstanding. Based on his argument, MGX is an investor that decided to use USD1 after the Binance co-founder asked them to make payments in crypto, since he disliked working with banks. Additionally, CZ claimed that he had never met or spoken with Trump. The closest he has ever come to the US president, according to his statement, is 30-40 feet, at Davos earlier this week. Afterwards, he expressed his gratitude to Trump concerning his decision to pardon him. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

XRP is one such well-known cryptocurrency, but it also gets affected by the developments that are happening on the regulatory side as well as the global politics that are being formed. Currently, it is below $2.00. Even if it continues with the upward move, the growth might be limited. Investors are now discovering bigger potential in projects such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Although XRP can only anticipate small gains, MUTM will provide a large profit to its holders right from the start. The current presale value of MUTM stands at $0.04. Limited Upside For XRP Recent news for the XRP currency reveals a coin which faces serious issues. The value of the currency fell for the sixth consecutive day, reaching a price of $1.85 due to US-Europe trade tensions. There are also delays in the regulatory overhaul in the crypto markets. Specialists believe that XRP can reach $2.50 or even $3.66 in the near future. Nonetheless, this is quite modest in comparison to the growth that new coins can provide. XRP is an established coin; it has been in existence for quite some time. A growth from $1.85 to $3.66 is quite positive but does not qualify as multiplication of one’s capital. For the best cryptocurrency to invest in at the moment, one would have to look at an early-stage coin rather than one that is affected by political factors. Mutuum Finance Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 7 of its presale, with a price of $0.04 per token. Supply is limited and the availability of tokens is running low. Phase 8 starts at $0.045. The price for the token launch is $0.06 with immediate upside expected, meaning there is at least a 550% profit margin immediately. A higher expected gain is to be found in a later phase as adoption grows. The supply of its tokens is constant; 4 billion. The demand for MUTM will probably also grow with the rising usage of the Mutuum platform. The analysts forecasting the values opine that the prices might reach a point of $1 to $5 following the launch of the token. An initial investment of only $100 may increase to $2,500 according to early forecasts. Safety through Over-Collateralization Loans One of the prominent aspects of Mutuum Finance is the provision of safe loans. The borrowers have to lock collateral that exceeds the loan amount; for instance, a loan of $5,000 requires locking around $7,500 in ETH. It acts as a guarantee against the loan being shut down abruptly because of minor changes in the markets. The above safety framework makes the platform more attractive to users, and thus the platform fees will be higher. As a holder of the MUTM, one will reap the benefits of the rise in the value of the tokens. The above framework makes MUTM a safer and more prudent option compared to many of the new tokens. Earning Rewards through Security Research There are several Mutuum Finance gives a lot of importance to security and has a Bug Bounty Program with a reward budget of $50,000. Bugs discovered in the codes can earn a reward of a maximum of $200 for low-level bugs and a maximum of $2,000 for critical bugs. The emphasis on safety shows the team cares. Greater confidence in investors may translate to increased buying-and-holding in MUTM, which may cause prices to increase. Emphasis on safety is an additional reason to consider MUTM a top investment in the future. Why MUTM Represents a Genuine Opportunity Although XRP might have some gradual increases, its course is not certain in light of government and regulation issues. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), on the other hand, offers a brighter future in terms of a final presale opportunity with a favorable price, a revenue-generating platform, and a development team working for the benefit of its clients. The projected figures show that a small investment will result in a large return. Although XRP is growing gradually, investment in MUTM will enable the achievement of wealth. You should not forget the final step of Phase 7. It is a good investment opportunity for the next big cryptocurrency.

Glassnode Says Watch This",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/can-bitcoin-revisit-97600-glassnode/,"Bitcoin’s push to $97,600 last week drew a burst of bullish options activity, but Glassnode argues the derivatives tape looked more like short-dated positioning than broad-based conviction. In a Jan. 23 thread, the on-chain analytics firm pointed to a split between front-end call demand and longer-dated risk pricing that stayed anchored in downside protection. “Let’s deep dive into options market behavior during last week’s move to 97.6K, and how options metrics help gauge conviction behind the move,” Glassnode wrote. The core takeaway: upside flow showed up, but it didn’t meaningfully change how the market priced risk further out the curve. What Bitcoin Traders Can Learn From Last Week’s Rally Glassnode first focused on near-term skew. Around mid-January, BTC rose roughly 8% over a few days, and the 1-week 25-delta skew moved sharply toward neutral from “deep put territory.” That kind of front-end shift can look like a market flipping bullish—until you check whether the same repricing is happening in longer expiries. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Selling Off On Quantum Fears? A Reality Check “Careful though,” Glassnode warned. “Near-dated call demand is often misread as directional conviction.” The thread paired that point with flow data: the options volume put/call ratio dropped from 1 to 0.4, signaling a surge in call activity. But, as Glassnode framed it, the question is not whether calls were bought, but how short-dated that demand actually was. The longer-dated picture was notably less enthusiastic. Glassnode said the 1-month 25-delta skew “only moved from 7% to 4% at the low,” staying in put asymmetry even as the 1-week skew fell from 8% to 1%. On the 3-month 25-delta skew, the shift was even smaller (less than 1.5%) and it “stayed firmly in put territory,” continuing to price asymmetric downside. For Glassnode, that divergence matters because it separates “flow” from “risk pricing.” Upside participation can be real, but if the market does not reprice skew across maturities, it suggests traders are not extending that optimism into a higher-conviction, longer-horizon view. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Power Shift: New Whales Now Control The Market The volatility tape reinforced the same message. “Layering in ATM implied volatility, we see vol being sold as price moved higher,” Glassnode wrote. “Gamma sellers monetized the rally. This is not the volatility behavior typically associated with sustained breakouts.” That combination: front-end call demand alongside vol supply can align with tactical positioning rather than a regime change. It can also leave spot moves more vulnerable if follow-through buying does not materialize once short-dated structures roll off. Glassnode closed with a checklist for what a cleaner breakout would look like: “An ideal breakout setup combines spot pressing key levels, skew pointing higher with conviction across maturities, and volatility being bid. Last week’s move didn’t meet those conditions.” For traders watching whether BTC can revisit $97,600, the thread’s implication is straightforward: monitor whether longer-dated skew begins to lift out of put territory and whether implied volatility starts to get bid, not sold, as spot tests key levels again. At press time, BTC traded at $89,297.

57425627,658837,1769220058,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57425627.jpeg,$48M Bitcoin Heist: Phishing Scam Empties South Korea’s Seized Crypto,https://bitcoinist.com/48m-bitcoin-heist-phishing-scam-empties-south-koreas-seized-crypto/,"South Korean authorities have come under scrutiny after a large stash of seized Bitcoin went missing during a routine check. The loss was discovered when officials found that some of the wallets that had been held as criminal evidence were empty. According to multiple reports, the value of the missing Bitcoin is about 70 billion won — roughly $47.7–$48 million. How Officials Found The Theft Reports say the gap showed up during a routine audit of confiscated digital assets at the Gwangju District Prosecutors’ Office. An internal check flagged transfers from wallets that had been marked as evidence, and investigators traced the movement back to external addresses. The office immediately opened an inquiry to determine how access was lost and whether any recovery is possible. Initial findings point to a phishing scam as the trigger. According to local coverage, a staff member accessed a fraudulent website that impersonated a legitimate service, and that interaction exposed passwords and private keys. Once the credentials were captured, the Bitcoin was moved out in transactions that cannot be reversed. Security Lapses And USB Storage Reports note that some of the access details for the seized assets were kept on portable drives rather than in hardened custody systems. That practice appears to have made it easier for attackers to grab the keys once the phishing trap was sprung. Simple mistakes can cost millions when the asset is bearer-like and transfers are final. The theft has raised hard questions about how state agencies handle crypto. Some experts say that the tools used by prosecutors were more suited to personal use than to government-level custody. There are calls for stricter rules, multi-signature setups, and cold storage protocols that do not rely on easily copied passwords. Tracing The Bitcoin Blockchain records show the funds moving through several wallets after the initial transfer. That public trail gives investigators leads, but tracing tokens to a final cash-out point is often slow and requires cooperation from foreign exchanges and on-chain analytics firms. Reports say authorities are working with outside specialists to map the flow. What Prosecutors Are Doing Next The Gwangju prosecutors’ office has vowed a full probe, and officials are trying to reconstruct events step by step. There are also signs that the incident will trigger a review of national procedures for holding seized digital property. Some lawmakers and legal experts have already called for clearer standards and oversight.

In 2029, Floki Inu is predicted to reach a maximum price of $0.0001160. FLOKI price can reach a maximum level of $0.0001740 and an average trading price of $0.0001165 in 2032. Floki Inu is a meme coin driven by its community, the Floki Vikings. Inspired by Shiba Inu, Floki Inu aims to democratize power in the crypto space, pivoting the crypto market away from traditional financial entities. The Floki project ecosystem is diverse. It includes Valhalla, a blockchain combat game that rewards players with Floki tokens, and Floki Places, a store for merchandise and NFTs where purchases can be made using Floki tokens. Additionally, Floki University provides educational resources on the cryptocurrency market and blockchain technology. The launch (June 30, 2025) of the Valhalla mainnet of opBNB, coupled with DeFi partnerships like Chainlink, collectively enhances Floki Inu’s value and future potential by driving demand and expanding its use.

Daily structure remains weak below $0.0000450, keeping downside risk alive if $0.0000400 fails. The 4-hour trend remains capped by descending averages, suggesting any bounce is fragile. FLOKI on the daily timeframe On the daily chart for January 24, FLOKI is trading around $0.0000431 after a mild −0.48% session, holding just above the lower Bollinger Band near $0.0000402 while remaining well below the mid-band around $0.0000499. This places the price roughly 13–15% beneath the recent local peak near $0.0000500, confirming the broader pullback phase. The candle structure shows shrinking bodies and reduced downside follow-through, suggesting selling pressure is cooling, but not yet reversing. FLOKIUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD remains negative with the histogram still red, though the bars are contracting, which hints at bearish momentum deceleration rather than a bullish turn. OBV has flattened after a steady decline, signaling that distribution may be pausing, yet there is no clear accumulation to support an upside breakout. A daily close below $0.0000400 would reopen downside risk toward the $0.000037–0.000038 zone, while reclaiming $0.0000450 is needed to relieve immediate bearish structure. FLOKI on the 4-hour timeframe On the 4-hour chart, FLOKI continues to print lower highs beneath the Alligator averages, with price capped around $0.0000437–$0.0000443 and repeatedly rejecting that zone. The recent range low near $0.0000425 has held so far, but each bounce is shallow, reflecting weak dip demand. FLOKIUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The RSI sits around 40–42, below the neutral 50 level, reinforcing that momentum favors sellers, even though it’s far from oversold. From the most recent intraday high near $0.0000450, the price has slipped roughly 4%, and unless $0.0000445 is reclaimed with conviction, upside attempts are likely to remain corrective rather than impulsive.

A sustained hold above $0.0000425 could extend consolidation, but only a reclaim of $0.0000450–$0.0000500 would shift the outlook from defensive to constructive; failure to hold current support risks another leg down. Is Floki Inu a good investment? FLOKI INU could be a big win or a big loss. It’s backed by a strong Floki community and consistent ecosystem developments, which can drive short-and long-term gains. But it’s risky, with price swings and unclear long-term value. Only invest if you’re comfortable with the risk. Will FLOKI reach $0.001? Expert analysis suggests that the $0.001 price point is achievable, provided utility grows and investor interest increases enough to drive FLOKI up ~18.6x its current market cap. Will Floki reach $0.01? FLOKI would need a market cap of up to $95 to $100 billion to hit $0.01, over 95x its current value. Only the top six cryptos have surpassed this level, making it a major challenge without massive growth in adoption and demand. While possible, it’s unlikely in the short term. Does FLOKI have a good long-term future? According to expert analysis, FLOKI has a promising long-term future with consistent growth potential. The coin could reach up to $0.002 within the decade.

After yesterday’s bearish breakdown below $90K, price action has slipped back into indecisive territory, raising fresh questions about whether this pullback is a temporary shakeout or the start of a deeper corrective phase. Related Reading: XRP Distribution Phase Continues, But Funding Rates Suggest Shorts Are Overextended According to top analyst Axel Adler, a macro indicator called Trend Pulse helps explain why momentum has faded. Adler notes that since January 19, the market has remained in Bear Mode, with the Bull phase absent for 83 consecutive days. Two separate charts reinforce this shift, showing that both short-term momentum and quarterly performance have turned negative at the same time. Trend Pulse recently shifted from Neutral to Bear, driven by a double-negative setup: the 14-day return has flipped red, and the SMA30 versus SMA200 trend signal is also negative. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s quarterly return sits at -19%, confirming macro weakness, but without the kind of extreme that often signals a definitive bottom. Bitcoin Remains Stuck In Bear Mode As Macro Signals Stay Negative Adler notes that Bitcoin’s last Bull Mode signal was printed on November 2, 2025, when BTC traded near $110,000—roughly 83 days ago. Since then, the market has failed to regain structural strength. Even the Neutral stretch between December 30 and January 18 proved too short and too weak to restore the long-term trend, leaving Bitcoin vulnerable once selling pressure returned. Adler explains that the first trigger for improvement is the 14-day return moving back above 0, which would shift the regime from Bear to Neutral. However, a full transition back into Bull Mode requires a second condition: SMA30 breaking above SMA200. Given the current divergence between the two averages, that crossover would likely demand 3–4 weeks of sustained upside rather than a short-lived bounce. The Bitcoin Price Performance chart adds macro context by tracking quarterly return (90D) as a sentiment proxy. Historically, readings above +75% align with euphoria, while values below 0% signal pessimism, and drops below -30% reflect capitulation. Bitcoin’s quarterly return sits near -19%, negative but far from deep bear-market extremes. Yet the 7-day change (-6.8%) suggests downside momentum is accelerating after the $90K breakdown. Together, Trend Pulse and quarterly returns point to moderate pessimism without final capitulation, leaving the market at a decision point. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply In Profit Stalls At 71%: Still Not Enough For A Sustainable Recovery BTC Moving Averages Cap Recovery Bitcoin is trading near $89,000 after failing to hold above the $90,000 psychological level, reinforcing the market’s current indecision. The chart shows BTC printing a lower-high structure since the early November peak, followed by a sharp selloff that reset price into a wide consolidation range. After bottoming in late November, Bitcoin rebounded but struggled to build sustained momentum, repeatedly stalling on push attempts toward the mid-$90K zone. From a trend perspective, BTC remains pressured beneath its key moving averages. Price is trading below the green long-term average and the blue mid-term average, both of which are now sloping downward, signaling that broader momentum continues to lean bearish. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Power Shift: New Whales Now Control The Market The most recent rejection occurred as BTC briefly pushed into the $95K–$97K area, only to roll over and break back down toward the range lows. Meanwhile, the red long-term average remains well above price near the low-$100Ks, highlighting how far BTC would need to recover to reestablish a stronger macro uptrend. Volume has picked up on selloffs relative to bounces, suggesting that downside moves are still being met with more urgency. For bulls, reclaiming $90K and then holding above $92K–$94K is key. Otherwise, the chart keeps risk open for a deeper pullback toward the mid-$80K region.

57426876,658805,1769223644,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57426876.jpeg,Institutional-Scale Ethereum Lockup: Bitmine Crosses 1.94M ETH Staked Mark,https://bitcoinist.com/institutional-scale-ethereum-lockup-bitmine-crosses/,"Ethereum has slipped below the critical $3,000 level, adding fresh pressure to a market that is already showing clear signs of hesitation. After weeks of choppy price action, ETH is now entering a more fragile phase where failed recoveries are starting to shift sentiment. With sellers gaining control and bullish momentum fading, several analysts are warning that this breakdown could open the door for a deeper correction if demand does not return quickly. The timing is important. Ethereum is moving through a pivotal zone where short-term price direction could shape the broader narrative for 2026. If ETH continues to trade below $3,000 and lower support levels fail to hold, the market may transition into a prolonged risk-off regime. On the other hand, a fast recovery back above this psychological threshold could signal that the breakdown was only a liquidity sweep, setting up a rebound toward higher resistance. Despite a weakening price structure, on-chain activity suggests large players remain active. Market data shows that Bitmine staked another 171,264 ETH, worth roughly $503.2 million, just a few hours ago. The move adds to the firm’s growing exposure and reinforces the idea that institutional-scale actors are still positioning aggressively, even as Ethereum faces one of its most decisive moments of the year. Bitmine’s ETH Staking Signals Long-Term Conviction Despite Short-Term Weakness According to data from Arkham, Bitmine has now staked a total of 1,943,200 ETH, worth roughly $5.71 billion, marking one of the most aggressive Ethereum accumulation and yield-positioning moves currently visible on-chain. Staking at this scale removes a significant amount of ETH from liquid circulation, effectively shifting supply away from exchanges and into long-term validator positions. In practical terms, it suggests Bitmine is not positioning for a short-term flip, but rather treating Ethereum as a strategic asset that can generate native yield while potentially appreciating over time. This activity stands out because it is happening while Ethereum is under pressure after losing the $3,000 level. At the moment, the market is stuck in a fragile, risk-sensitive phase, where traders are reacting quickly to breakdowns and failed recoveries. Momentum has weakened, liquidity remains thin, and analysts are increasingly warning that a deeper correction could unfold if key supports continue to fail. However, Bitmine’s staking expansion provides a counter-signal: large players appear willing to keep committing capital even as sentiment deteriorates. That divergence highlights the current split in the market—short-term participants are defensive, while longer-term allocators are still building exposure. If price stabilizes, this kind of staking-driven supply reduction can become a structural tailwind. Ethereum Downtrend Pressure Builds Ethereum is trading near $2,940 after losing the key $3,000 psychological level, putting the market back into a fragile position. The chart shows ETH has been trending lower since the October peak, with a clear sequence of lower highs and heavy sell-side volatility that accelerated into November. Although ETH managed to stabilize into a broad consolidation range between roughly $2,850 and $3,250, the most recent breakdown suggests buyers are struggling to defend support when momentum fades. From a trend perspective, Ethereum remains capped beneath its major moving averages. Price is trading below the green long-term average and the blue mid-term average, both of which are sloping downward and acting as dynamic resistance. The recent rebound attempt toward the $3,300–$3,400 zone failed right under the green line, reinforcing that sellers are still controlling rallies. Meanwhile, the red long-term average sits higher near the mid-$3,000s, highlighting that ETH remains far from reclaiming a macro bullish structure. Volume has increased on the sharp red candles compared to the slower grind higher, which often signals distribution rather than healthy accumulation. If ETH cannot reclaim $3,000 quickly, downside risk opens toward the $2,850 range floor. A clean recovery back above $3,150–$3,250 would be needed to reduce bearish pressure and reset the near-term trend.

SEC-CFTC Push Joint Crypto Oversight On Thursday, SEC Chairman Paul Atking and CFTC Chairman Michael Selig announced they will hold an event next week to discuss regulatory harmonization between the two sister agencies. According to the announcement, the pro-industry chairmen will outline the efforts to work together and cooperate to “deliver on President Trump’s promise to make the United States the crypto capital of the world.” The event will be hosted on January 27 at the CFTC headquarters and moderated by crypto journalist Eleanor Terret. Additionally, it will be open to the public and livestreamed on both agencies’ websites. “For too long, market participants have been forced to navigate regulatory boundaries that are unclear in application and misaligned in design, based solely on legacy jurisdictional silos,” said SEC Chair Atkins and CFTC Chair Selig in a joint statement. “This event will build on our broader harmonization efforts to ensure that innovation takes root on American soil, under American law, and in service of American investors, consumers, and economic leadership,” they added. Last year, the SEC and CFTC began discussing their options for effectively collaborating on crypto regulations, as a clear framework for digital assets became a top priority for the agencies As reported by Bitcoinist, the agencies explored reinstating the CFTC-SEC joint advisory committee to develop recommendations on ongoing issues, including efforts in regulatory coordination. During a September joint roundtable between the two agencies, Atking declared that the era of regulatory fragmentation was ending and the age of harmonized, innovation-friendly crypto oversight was here: We are at a crossroads. If we follow the path of our predecessors, America risks ceding leadership in the next chapter of financial history. (…) This ends now (…) our two agencies must work in lockstep to transform dual regulation from a source of confusion into a source of strength. Together, we can offer the best of both worlds: the investor protections that have defined U.S. markets, combined with the innovation-friendly approach that will keep us at the frontier of financial technology throughout the 21st century. The SEC’s Director of the Division of Trading and Markets, Jamie Selway, highlighted the SEC’s efforts to “further harmonize its rules with our sister regulator, the CFTC. In a January 22 speech, He affirmed that the Division will work shoulder-to-shoulder with the CFTC staff to ensure the US’s continued leadership in financial markets, following Atkins’ September directions. Congress Regulatory Efforts Stall The SEC and CFTC’s efforts to regulate the crypto market come as the US Congress struggles to establish a framework to oversee the sector. The Senate Banking Committee’s version of the market structure bill, which focuses on the SEC’s oversight, was delayed after multiple market participants criticized the bill’s draft. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong shared his disappointment with the crypto legislation, withdrawing the company’s support last week. “This version would be materially worse than the current status quo. We’d rather have no bill than a bad bill,” he affirmed. The Senate Agriculture Committee published its version of the CLARITY Act on Thursday, which mainly addresses the CFTC’s role and regulations, scheduling its markup session for January 27. Eleanor Terret shared that the industry’s reaction has been mostly positive, “with stakeholders noting the bill’s close similarities to the House Agriculture Committee’s version of the Clarity Act.” However, recent reports have warned that the Banking Committee’s crypto talks may not resume until later February or early March, as focus shifts to advancing affordable housing plans linked to President Trump’s priorities.",Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|CFTC chairman|CLARITY Act|Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)|Crypto legislation|crypto market structure bill|Michael Selig|SEC Chair Paul Atkins|US Congress|US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)|US Senate Banking Committee,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-24 04:00:03

The coin has risen slightly over the past day, though it remains down for the week. Traders are pointing to familiar chart patterns, suggesting the quiet period may be nearing an end. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Sharp Reversal Leaves Over $800 Million Liquidated In 1 Day Traders Spot A Familiar Price Pattern A fresh take on XRP came from DonWedge, who posted a half-day chart on TradingView. Though he kept it short – just “XRP looks good” – the message carried weight. Instead of bold predictions, his analysis leaned on patterns. A downward-sloping channel draws the eye, much like one seen months before. Shape echoes past rhythm. What stands out is how closely current movement tracks earlier behavior. The image tells part of the story; context fills in the rest. Time will show whether history bends toward repetition. That old rise in XRP moved fast. Following that climb, it slipped into a steady decline lasting around half a year. Once sellers slowed their pace, the price jumped again without warning. $XRP looks good pic.twitter.com/OnyChRVzNp — Don 🐂 (@DonWedge) January 21, 2026 Fresh lows in XRP’s path hug the bottom stretch of a familiar range, pressure easing – some watchful eyes guess what comes next might climb. Volume And Resistance Are Key According to reports, the next major hurdle is a multi-month trendline resistance near $2.10. A clean daily close above this line, combined with rising volume, could signal the start of a new uptrend. DonWedge projects that if the breakout occurs, XRP could aim for $4. From current levels, this would require a little over a 100% increase. Traders note, however, that moves without volume confirmation can fail, leading to false breakouts and extended consolidation. Market Expert Projects A Telling Year Based on reports, analyst ChartNerd says 2026 will be a “telling year” for XRP. He expects the coin either to confirm a strong breakout with fresh momentum or to fall below the structure it has defended for over a year. After a macro breakout in Q4 2024, $XRP has been accumulating above its prior 2021 highs for over a year. The whole of 2025 was sideways, boring, and a test of even the most durable minds. 2026 is going to be the telling year. Compression typically leads to expansion. Buckle up. pic.twitter.com/QJb7JAmIkL — 🇬🇧 ChartNerd 📊 (@ChartNerdTA) January 18, 2026 Lately, the sideways grind has worn thin for some investors – yet hints of resilience still flicker through the numbers. Breaking past $2.10 with force might spark what comes next, lining up with the pattern DonWedge laid out on his chart. Patience now may quietly pay off later. Related Reading: Bitcoin Influencers Get Spotlight In X’s New ‘Starterpacks’ A Breakout Might Shift What Happens Next A sudden jump in price might push XRP toward $4 fast, provided it finishes above the trendline with strong movement. Higher goals are possible, yet reaching them means buyers keep stepping in without pause. So far, things look cautious rather than certain.

Senators from both parties have submitted a flurry of changes to the pending bill — popularly known as the CLARITY Act in its current draft — ahead of a key markup session later this month. Among the most contentious proposals are ethics-focused provisions aimed at curbing potential conflicts of interest among senior government officials. Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado was among the lawmakers who sought to add the “Digital Asset Ethics Act” to the bill, an amendment that would bar top officials like the President, Vice President, and members of Congress from certain crypto-related financial transactions. Currently, the bill is scheduled for debate in the Senate Agricultural Committee on Tuesday next week. Senators suggested changes to stop fake transactions at digital asset kiosks The proposed ethics amendment aims to ease concerns among many Democrats about Trump and his family’s involvement in crypto. Bloomberg puts Trump’s crypto-related earnings at approximately $1.4 billion, driven in part by the DeFi and stablecoin project World Liberty Financial. Not to mention, the president’s family maintains a 20% stake in the mining company American Bitcoin. Lawmakers also submitted amendments to curb fake transactions at digital asset kiosks, including one from Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., that would hold off a crypto bill until at least four CFTC commissioners are confirmed. The issue has sparked debate among lawmakers, as the CFTC currently has only one commissioner, Chair Michael Selig, out of a possible five, and no more than three can belong to the same political party. Republicans and Democrats are still split on several fundamental policy issues on the bill, Sen. John Boozman, R-Ark., chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee, shared Wednesday. He added, however, that he appreciates the teamwork that helped improve the legislation. For the crypto structure bill to pass in the Senate, Democrats must weigh in, since 60 votes are needed, meaning at least 7 Democrats would have to support it, even with all Republicans on board. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand believes the crypto market structure bills will advance Even though Republicans and Democrats haven’t reached a consensus, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, D-NY, said she remains hopeful the committee’s updated crypto legislation will move forward. “Senators have been working on a bipartisan basis for the last six months pretty intensely, and we have two different bills,” Gillibrand told reporters. She argued that both bills, the one under the Agriculture Committee, which oversees the CFTC, and the second bill, still under debate by the Banking Committee, responsible for the SEC and banking regulations, are being advanced together. The Democratic senator, though not a member of the Agriculture Committee, has been engaged in negotiations on the crypto legislation. However, the markup hearing on the Senate Banking Committee’s draft digital asset legislation, originally scheduled for Jan. 15, was delayed at the last minute due to opposition from crypto companies such as Coinbase . When asked about the possibility of delays for the Senate Agriculture Committee’s hearing, Gillibrand contended that, despite unresolved bipartisan issues, she expects the markup to go ahead on Tuesday. She further asserted that the Agriculture Committee’s draft is still under review and hopes senators will continue to collaborate to amend and improve it. However, she encouraged Senators to look back on some bipartisan compromises they made on an earlier draft of the bill that were later omitted. She said, “My hope is that those senators can get back to the drawing board and try to re-include some of those compromises that I thought were very strong.” The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter.

After repeated failures to reclaim this psychological threshold, price action has started to reflect a lack of conviction on both sides, with buyers hesitating to step in aggressively and sellers pressing every rebound attempt. While the broader trend has not fully collapsed, the inability to hold key levels is increasing uncertainty around Bitcoin’s next major move. Related Reading: XRP Distribution Phase Continues, But Funding Rates Suggest Shorts Are Overextended Top analyst Darkfost argues that on-chain signals are starting to mirror conditions typically seen near the end of prolonged drawdowns. According to his analysis, Bitcoin’s unrealized profits and losses are sliding back toward levels that have historically appeared only at the exit of bear markets, when the market has already absorbed a deep reset in sentiment. This shift suggests that stress is building under the surface, even if price has not yet entered a full capitulation phase. Since Bitcoin’s last all-time high, Darkfost notes that many late-arriving investors have moved into uncomfortable territory, facing mounting downside pressure as the market cools. As a result, unrealized profits are shrinking, unrealized losses are expanding, and the overall balance continues to deteriorate—an environment that often forces traders into a decisive choice between holding through volatility or exiting under stress. Decision Point For Bitcoin Investors Darkfost highlighted a chart based on an adjusted version of NUPL (Net Unrealized Profit/Loss), designed to capture investor stress more accurately during shifting market regimes. Instead of relying solely on the standard market cap, the model incorporates the realized capitalization of both Short-Term Holders (STHs) and Long-Term Holders (LTHs), then compares that blended realized foundation against Bitcoin’s traditional market cap. The result is a clearer view of how much profit or loss sits “on paper” across the market, filtered through a more structural lens. To reduce noise and better define trend shifts, the metric is smoothed using an average, producing what Darkfost refers to as aNUPL. The key takeaway is that Bitcoin is approaching levels that have historically forced investors into a binary decision. When unrealized profits compress and unrealized losses expand to these ranges, holders typically face two outcomes: hold and continue accumulating, or capitulate and lock in losses. That difference in behavior becomes critical because it shapes liquidity, sentiment, and the next directional trend. If long-term participants absorb the pressure and keep holding, the market can stabilize and rotate back into recovery. But if selling accelerates from stressed cohorts, the decline can deepen into a broader bear phase. This is why tracking realized and unrealized profit dynamics remains essential, especially during periods of uncertainty. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply In Profit Stalls At 71%: Still Not Enough For A Sustainable Recovery Bitcoin Consolidates After Sharp Weekly Breakdown Bitcoin is trading around $89,000 on the weekly chart after a steep selloff that pushed the price out of its prior distribution zone. The latest candle reflects heavy downside pressure, with BTC dropping roughly 4.8% on the week and struggling to stabilize near a key pivot that has repeatedly acted as support and resistance throughout the cycle. After failing to hold above the psychological $90,000 threshold, the market is now trapped in a tight consolidation range, suggesting traders are waiting for confirmation before committing to a larger move. Related Reading: Ethereum Supply Tightens On Binance As Reserves Hit Lowest Level Since 2016 From a trend standpoint, Bitcoin remains vulnerable as it trades below the blue moving average, which is now acting as overhead resistance near the low-$100K region. The rejection from that dynamic level aligns with the broader structure: BTC topped near the mid-$120K range, then entered a sharp corrective leg that reset momentum into early 2026. While the green moving average continues to slope upward and is approaching the current price zone, the market has not yet shown the strength needed to reclaim its former trend trajectory. Importantly, the weekly structure is now compressing. If buyers can defend the $88K–$90K region and push BTC back above $92K–$95K, it would signal a recovery attempt toward the moving average band. However, a sustained failure here increases the risk of a deeper retracement toward the low-$80K zone, where prior demand previously emerged.

57428512,658861,1769230837,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57428512.jpeg,Crypto Company Ledger Plans US IPO With Valuation Expected To Top $4 Billion,https://bitcoinist.com/ledger-us-ipo-valuation-expected-to-top-4-billion/,"Ledger, the French maker of hardware wallets for crypto assets, is reportedly moving ahead with plans for a potential initial public offering (IPO) in New York, signaling continued momentum in public market interest for digital asset companies. The listing would place Ledger among a growing group of crypto firms seeking access to US capital markets, following the recent public debut of BitGo earlier this week. Ledger Taps Wall Street Giants For US IPO The move comes amid a broader initial public offering wave that gained strong traction throughout 2025, when several major crypto-native companies either went public or began laying the groundwork to do so. Firms such as Circle (CRLC), Bullish (BLSH), eToro (ETOR), Figure (FIGR), and Gemini (GEMI) have already gone public in the US, while Grayscale and Kraken remain part of the renewed IPO push, with filings submitted and preparations still underway. According to a report by the Financial Times, Ledger has engaged investment banks including Goldman Sachs and Barclays to advise on its initial public offering in the United States. People familiar with the matter say the offering could value the company at more than $4 billion. While the IPO could take place as soon as this year, sources cautioned that the plans remain subject to change. Ledger’s reported IPO ambitions come as BitGo opened trading on Thursday with its shares jumping 24.6%, giving the company a valuation of approximately $2.59 billion. BitGo and several of its existing shareholders sold 11.8 million shares priced above the initially marketed range of $15 to $17, raising $212.8 million in the process. BitGo Sets Tone For 2026 Crypto IPOs Market experts have pointed to BitGo’s performance as an important signal for the broader crypto IPO landscape. Lukas Muehlbauer, an IPOX research associate, described BitGo’s listing as the first major test of investor demand for crypto-related offerings in 2026. He noted that while Gemini went public near the peak of the crypto market last year, BitGo entered the market during a period of recent selloffs, making its reception particularly telling. Muehlbauer added that BitGo’s positioning as a profitable and regulated “digital asset infrastructure company,” rather than a business tied directly to token price movements, helped insulate it from “Bitcoin’s (BTC) day-to-day volatility.” Beyond Ledger, expectations are building that the pipeline of crypto IPOs will continue to grow. In addition to Kraken and Grayscale, industry experts believe the coming year could bring an even larger number of crypto-related IPOs in the US. “2025 marked the professionalization of crypto, and the public markets noticed,” said Mike Bellin, a partner at PwC who leads the firm’s US IPO practice. Some offerings, however, have faced delays. Elliot Han, chief investment officer at C1 Fund, said that the fourth quarter could have seen an even higher number of IPOs. He pointed to the federal government’s prolonged shutdown as a key factor that pushed several listings into the first quarter of 2026. Han also noted that heightened stock market volatility toward the end of the third quarter added further complications.

Short positions bore the overwhelming brunt of this financial pressure, particularly in Bitcoin and Ethereum perpetual futures markets. This significant liquidation event highlights the volatile nature of cryptocurrency derivatives trading and its substantial impact on market dynamics. Crypto Liquidations Analysis: Breaking Down the $216M Event The cryptocurrency perpetual futures market witnessed extraordinary activity during this liquidation period. Bitcoin led the cascade with $110 million in liquidated positions, while Ethereum followed closely with $92.47 million. Solana recorded $13.59 million in liquidations, completing the top three affected assets. These figures represent forced position closures by exchanges when traders cannot meet margin requirements. Market analysts immediately noted the disproportionate impact on short sellers. Approximately 78.92% of Bitcoin liquidations involved short positions, indicating traders betting on price declines faced significant losses. Similarly, 64.85% of Ethereum liquidations affected short positions, and 57.63% of Solana liquidations impacted bearish traders. This pattern suggests a rapid price movement upward triggered margin calls across major exchanges. 24-Hour Cryptocurrency Liquidation Breakdown Asset Total Liquidations Short Position Percentage Long Position Percentage Bitcoin (BTC) $110 million 78.92% 21.08% Ethereum (ETH) $92.47 million 64.85% 35.15% Solana (SOL) $13.59 million 57.63% 42.37% Other Assets ~$0.94 million Data varies Data varies Understanding Perpetual Futures Market Mechanics Perpetual futures contracts differ significantly from traditional futures. These derivative instruments lack expiration dates, allowing traders to maintain positions indefinitely. However, they incorporate funding rate mechanisms that periodically transfer funds between long and short positions. This structure maintains contract prices close to underlying spot prices while creating complex risk dynamics. Several key factors contributed to this liquidation event: Leverage ratios averaging 10-25x across major exchanges Funding rate fluctuations increasing costs for short positions Market sentiment shifts triggering rapid price movements Cascading liquidations creating chain reaction effects Exchange protocols automatically trigger liquidations when positions reach specific thresholds. Consequently, these forced closures often accelerate price movements in the triggering direction. This phenomenon creates feedback loops that can dramatically amplify market volatility within compressed timeframes. Historical Context and Market Comparisons The March 2025 liquidation event represents the most significant short-dominated liquidation since November 2023. During that previous period, Bitcoin experienced $150 million in liquidations with 72% affecting short positions. However, the combined $216 million across multiple assets in 2025 demonstrates broader market participation in derivative trading. Market data reveals increasing correlation between major cryptocurrency assets during volatility events. When Bitcoin experiences significant liquidations, Ethereum and other major altcoins typically follow similar patterns within hours. This interconnectedness reflects growing institutional participation and cross-margin trading strategies across cryptocurrency derivatives platforms. Bitcoin’s Dominant Role in Market Liquidations Bitcoin consistently leads cryptocurrency liquidation events due to its market dominance and high liquidity. The $110 million in Bitcoin liquidations represented approximately 51% of the total $216 million event. This disproportionate impact stems from Bitcoin’s status as the primary collateral asset across derivative platforms and its role as a market sentiment indicator. The 78.92% short position liquidation rate for Bitcoin suggests several market dynamics. First, many traders positioned for continued price declines before the liquidation event. Second, rapid price appreciation triggered margin calls on these leveraged short positions. Third, the cascading effect of these liquidations likely contributed to further upward price pressure during the period. Exchange data indicates Binance, Bybit, and OKX processed the majority of Bitcoin liquidations. These platforms dominate cryptocurrency derivatives trading with sophisticated risk management systems. However, even robust systems cannot prevent liquidations when markets move rapidly against highly leveraged positions. Ethereum and Altcoin Liquidation Dynamics Ethereum’s $92.47 million in liquidations marked its second-largest event in twelve months. The 64.85% short position liquidation rate reflects Ethereum’s unique market positioning. As the leading smart contract platform, Ethereum often experiences different volatility patterns than Bitcoin despite general correlation during extreme events. Several factors contributed to Ethereum’s significant liquidation volume: Protocol upgrade anticipation affecting trader positioning DeFi activity fluctuations influencing ETH demand Staking derivative products creating additional leverage exposure Institutional Ethereum futures introducing traditional market dynamics Solana’s $13.59 million in liquidations, while smaller in absolute terms, represented significant relative impact given its market capitalization. The 57.63% short position liquidation rate indicates balanced but bearish positioning before the volatility event. Solana’s growing derivatives market presence contributes to its increasing inclusion in major liquidation events. Expert Analysis of Market Implications Financial analysts emphasize several important implications from this liquidation event. First, the dominance of short position liquidations suggests underlying market strength despite volatility. Second, the substantial volumes indicate growing cryptocurrency derivatives market maturity and liquidity depth. Third, the event demonstrates improved exchange risk management compared to previous market cycles. Regulatory observers note increasing attention to cryptocurrency derivatives following such events. Multiple jurisdictions have proposed leverage limits on retail cryptocurrency trading. These proposals aim to reduce systemic risk from cascading liquidations while maintaining market functionality. The March 2025 event provides empirical data for these regulatory discussions. Market structure analysts highlight the role of automated trading systems during liquidation events. Algorithmic traders often provide liquidity during volatility but may also amplify movements through similar positioning. This creates complex interactions between human traders, algorithmic systems, and exchange risk protocols during high-volatility periods. Risk Management Lessons from the Liquidation Event The $216 million liquidation event offers valuable risk management insights for cryptocurrency traders. Position sizing emerges as the primary consideration, with excessive leverage creating vulnerability to relatively small price movements. Diversification across assets and instruments provides some protection but cannot eliminate systemic market risk during correlated events. Several practical strategies can mitigate liquidation risk: Conservative leverage ratios below 5x for most positions Multiple collateral types to reduce correlation risk Stop-loss orders at appropriate technical levels Regular position monitoring during high-volatility periods Understanding exchange-specific liquidation protocols and fees Exchange transparency regarding liquidation processes has improved significantly since 2023. Most major platforms now provide detailed documentation of their margin systems, liquidation triggers, and auction mechanisms. This transparency helps traders make informed decisions about position management and platform selection. Conclusion The $216 million cryptocurrency liquidation event dominated by short positions represents a significant market occurrence with multiple implications. Bitcoin led with $110 million in liquidations, while Ethereum and Solana contributed substantial additional volumes. The dominance of short position liquidations suggests underlying market strength despite volatility pressures. This event highlights the growing sophistication and risks of cryptocurrency derivatives markets while providing valuable data for traders, analysts, and regulators. As cryptocurrency markets continue maturing, such liquidation events will likely decrease in frequency but increase in absolute scale due to growing market participation and capital allocation. FAQs Q1: What causes cryptocurrency liquidations? Cryptocurrency liquidations occur when leveraged positions cannot meet margin requirements. Exchanges automatically close these positions to prevent losses exceeding collateral. Rapid price movements often trigger cascading liquidations across multiple traders. Q2: Why were short positions disproportionately affected? Short positions faced higher liquidation rates because traders had positioned for price declines before rapid appreciation. When prices rose against these leveraged short positions, margin calls forced closures, creating upward price pressure. Q3: How do perpetual futures differ from regular futures? Perpetual futures lack expiration dates and use funding mechanisms to track spot prices. Regular futures have set expiration dates and settle based on predetermined prices. Perpetual contracts enable continuous position maintenance with periodic funding payments. Q4: Which exchanges experienced the most liquidations? Major derivatives exchanges including Binance, Bybit, and OKX processed most liquidations. These platforms dominate cryptocurrency derivatives trading with sophisticated margin systems handling high volumes during volatility events. Q5: Can traders prevent liquidations? Traders can reduce liquidation risk through conservative leverage, diversified collateral, stop-loss orders, and careful position monitoring. However, rapid unexpected price movements can still trigger liquidations despite risk management measures.

The FCA emphasizes that rules are meant to set industry standards and not eliminate inherent investment risks, although the consumer duty requires firms to act in good faith. The UK regulator plans to collect all feedback by March 12 and open an application gateway for cryptoasset approvals in September. The FCA hopes to be done with all this before October, when new rules, including those already registered under money-laundering regulations (MLRs), will be authorized. The FCA has also set out proposals on how conduct standards, safeguarding, and redress will apply to crypto firms. These proposals are expected to continue the regulator’s progress towards an open, competitive, and sustainable crypto market that investors can trust. The consumer duty sets standards for crypto companies to ensure that they deliver positive outcomes for customers while helping them navigate their financial lives. Final consultation follows the package of proposals last December According to the FCA, these final consultations follow a package of proposals set out last December on applying the same approach to traditional finance in crypto. The regulator seeks to provide clear information for consumers, with well-balanced requirements for companies and flexibility to support innovation. The UK regulator is consulting on how the consumer duty will be supported by additional non-Handbook guidance to ensure companies deliver sufficient outcomes for retail customers. It will also seek feedback on its approach to handling conflicts and redress in order to ensure consumers have a clear path to resolving issues. Moreover, the FCA is looking at how to apply key conduct rules to crypto activities so that companies act transparently and fairly. Rules on buying crypto on credit and reducing the risks of harm from borrowing to invest will also be considered. The regulator is also following feedback on its approach to categorizing crypto firms under the Certification Regime and the Senior Managers Regime. Standards for staff skills and knowledge need to be set so that firms have competent employees managing crypto services. The FCA also wants crypto firms to report data to the regulator so that it can monitor risks and supervise operations effectively. It reminds investors that crypto is largely unregulated in the UK and is currently used for financial promotions and financial crimes. FCA awards Ripple MLR registration The FCA recently awarded MLR registration to XRP issuer Ripple, following its start of accepting applications last September. According to a notice published on its official website on January 22, the road to formal crypto regulation in the UK became clearer at the end of last year, with legislation from the Treasury extending existing financial rules to include crypto firms. Meanwhile, the FCA said earlier this month that crypto firms looking to offer services in the UK would be required to be authorized under the new rules taking effect in October 2027. The requirement also applies to crypto firms already registered under its MLRs. Crypto firms must also comply with operational resilience, consumer duty, financial crime, and governance requirements. The firms already registered under anti-money laundering or payment regulations will need full authorization, while those authorized by the FSMA must vary their permissions. However, the FCA does not plan to extend Financial Service Compensation Scheme (FSCS) protection to cryptoassets. The FSCS provides compensation for customers when companies cannot meet their liabilities. That will not be the same with investors in crypto firms that go out of business. These customers will not be able to claim compensation for investment losses, even those arising from regulated crypto activities. There are also potential inconsistencies in this approach, according to the FCA. Claims about shares held in custody will be covered by the FSCS, but claims about safeguarding tokens representing shares on blockchains will not be covered.

I’ve seen this story repeat across cycles. People who nailed Bitcoin early. People who rode Dogecoin memes at the perfect time. And people who watched XRP and Ethereum when they were still “small”, then blinked… and the numbers changed forever. If you’re reading this today, you’re not here for fleeting hype – you’re on the hunt for the next big early-stage crypto opportunities , the kind that may seem quiet at first but turns into a legend later. The question is simple: will your future self thank you for acting now, or will you regret missing out? Here’s the truth: APEMARS is the one you don’t want to overlook in 2026. With Stage 4 closing in less than 12 hours, this is your chance to get in before the price surge. Don’t miss your shot at the next 1000x opportunity – this is the best crypto to buy now. Keep reading, because what comes next could change everything. Grab APEMARS ($APRZ) Stage 4 Now Before Next Price Jump If XRP and Ethereum taught the market anything, it’s this: the best entries often look “too early” until they suddenly look “too late.” That’s why APEMARS ($APRZ) Stage 4 presale matters. It’s not about chasing something that already ran. It’s about positioning while the story is still being written, when participation feels quiet, and the crowd hasn’t fully arrived. With APEMARS ($APRZ), Over 500 holders are already on board, over 4.88 billion tokens have been sold, and more than $108k has been raised. The Burning Mechanism: Built To Tighten Supply Pressure Over Time One of the easiest mistakes investors make is thinking price only moves because of hype. Real moves happen when hype meets structure. APEMARS ($APRZ) features a burning mechanism that reduces the available supply over time, creating a “tighter” market dynamic as momentum grows. The psychology here is simple: when demand increases but the accessible supply doesn’t grow the same way, price pressure can build faster than people expect. Burns are not a magic button, but they can be a powerful design lever when combined with community attention, exchange liquidity, and a clear launch plan. And here’s the part that matters for buyers: burns create a story that keeps repeating in people’s heads, “What if supply keeps shrinking while interest keeps rising?” That single thought is the fuel behind some of the most emotional bull runs in crypto history. Ecosystem Reserve: The “Healthy Trading” Foundation After Launch A project can have attention and still fail if trading conditions are messy. That’s where APEMARS ($APRZ) adds a practical layer: Liquidity & Ecosystem Reserve. This reserve is structured to support: DEX liquidity pools, post-launch stabilization, ecosystem tools and expansion, and healthier trading conditions after launch. In plain words: it’s meant to help the market breathe. Liquidity matters because it reduces chaos. Stabilization planning matters because it reduces the risk of a “one big move” wiping out confidence. Expansion matters because strong ecosystems don’t rely on a single moment, they build a path for what comes next. Early-Stage Opportunity: Turning $2,000 into a Potential $366,000 with APEMARS A $2,000 investment in APEMARS Stage 4 at $0.00003003 per token could secure around 66.6 million $APRZ tokens. If the listing price reaches $0.0055, this stake may be worth approximately $366,000, highlighting the presale’s extraordinary growth potential for early investors ready to enter before the mainstream market catches on. How To Buy APEMARS ($APRZ) In Stage 4 Buying should feel simple, because when steps are confusing, people hesitate, and hesitation is how “early” turns into “late.” Visit the official APEMARS ($APRZ) presale page. Connect your wallet. Choose your payment option. Enter the amount you want to buy. Confirm the transaction in your wallet. Save your confirmation details for your records. If you’ve ever said “I was going to buy XRP” or “I almost bought ETH,” this is the moment where you don’t repeat the pattern. You don’t need to shout. You just need to act while it’s still early. XRP: From Pennies To A Price People Still Talk About XRP’s early days were the definition of “blink, and you’ll miss it.” Historical price data shows a launch-era price around $0.00589 and a low near $0.00294. That’s not “cheap.” That’s “almost ignored.” Then reality arrived: XRP reached a high of around $3.84. Read that again. A coin that once lived under a cent climbed into multi-dollar territory. That kind of move doesn’t just change portfolios, it changes lives. And it also creates a special kind of pain: the pain of being right about the idea, but late on the timing. Ethereum: The Opportunity Every Investor Reflects On Ethereum is the poster child for missed timing. Data shows an ICO price around $0.3080, with an early low of $0.4457 and a later peak of $4,552. That’s the difference between “interesting” and “historic.” And this is exactly why so many people feel the regret so deeply: Ethereum wasn’t hidden. It wasn’t invisible. It was right there, just early enough to feel uncertain, and just new enough to feel risky. This is what missed ICO pain looks like: You didn’t miss the coin. You missed the moment. And the market doesn’t refund missed moments. Conclusion: Make The Next Regret Someone Else’s Story XRP and Ethereum didn’t become painful memories because people never heard of them. They became painful memories because people heard, hesitated, and delayed. They waited for “clearer signals,” and by the time the signal was obvious, the best entry window had already moved. APEMARS Stage 4 presale is not about guaranteeing anything. It’s about giving yourself a fair shot at the kind of positioning that creates the biggest stories in crypto, the early chapters, not the late summaries. If you’re searching for early-stage crypto opportunities and asking what’s the best crypto to buy now, this is the type of moment you lean into before the crowd makes it trendy. XRP and Ethereum taught an unforgettable lesson: the market rewards courage early, not certainty late. APEMARS ($APRZ) stands out this year because it combines a supply-focused burn design, stage-based urgency, and a liquidity-and-ecosystem plan built for healthier trading after launch, the kind of structure serious buyers look for in a presale opportunity.

The digital asset, designed for fast cross-border payments, faces both unprecedented opportunities and regulatory challenges. This comprehensive analysis examines XRP’s potential trajectory through 2030, focusing on whether the cryptocurrency can realistically achieve the $5 milestone that many investors anticipate. Market data from Q1 2025 shows XRP trading within a defined range, but multiple factors could significantly alter its course in coming years. XRP Price Prediction: Analyzing the 2026 Landscape Financial analysts project several scenarios for XRP in 2026 based on current market conditions. The cryptocurrency’s performance largely depends on three key factors: regulatory clarity, institutional adoption, and broader market trends. According to data from multiple blockchain analytics firms, XRP transaction volume increased by 34% year-over-year in 2024. This growth suggests expanding utility beyond speculative trading. Several banking institutions have recently announced pilot programs using Ripple’s technology. These developments could drive demand for XRP as a bridge currency. However, regulatory decisions in major markets continue to create uncertainty. The SEC’s ongoing position on cryptocurrency classification remains a significant variable. Market sentiment typically reacts strongly to regulatory announcements, creating volatility that affects price predictions. Technical Analysis and Historical Patterns Technical analysts examine historical price patterns to identify potential future movements. XRP has demonstrated specific resistance and support levels over the past five years. The $1.20 level has served as a psychological barrier multiple times. Breaking through this resistance consistently would require substantial buying pressure. Trading volume analysis reveals increased institutional participation since 2023, which could provide more stability. Market capitalization comparisons show XRP maintaining its position among top cryptocurrencies. This relative stability suggests established network effects. The circulating supply dynamics also influence price projections. Unlike purely inflationary cryptocurrencies, XRP’s supply mechanism follows a different model. Understanding this distinction is crucial for accurate forecasting. Ripple’s Ecosystem Development Through 2027 Ripple continues expanding its partnerships and technological infrastructure. The company recently announced several central bank digital currency initiatives. These projects could integrate XRP into national payment systems. Such integration would represent a significant adoption milestone. Real-world utility fundamentally drives long-term value in cryptocurrency markets. The development of Ripple’s liquidity hub and other enterprise solutions creates additional demand channels. Financial institutions using these services often require XRP for settlement. This creates organic buying pressure separate from speculative trading. The correlation between partnership announcements and price movements demonstrates this relationship clearly. XRP Price Prediction Scenarios 2026-2028 Year Conservative Scenario Moderate Scenario Bullish Scenario 2026 $0.85 – $1.20 $1.20 – $1.80 $1.80 – $2.50 2027 $1.10 – $1.60 $1.60 – $2.40 $2.40 – $3.50 2028 $1.40 – $2.00 $2.00 – $3.00 $3.00 – $4.20 These scenarios consider multiple variables including adoption rates, regulatory developments, and overall cryptocurrency market growth. The conservative scenario assumes gradual adoption with persistent regulatory challenges. The moderate scenario incorporates successful resolution of major legal questions. The bullish scenario requires both regulatory clarity and accelerated institutional adoption. The Path to $5: Critical Factors for 2029-2030 Achieving the $5 price target requires specific conditions to align. Market analysts identify several prerequisites for this milestone. First, XRP must capture a significant portion of the cross-border payments market. Current estimates suggest this market could exceed $30 trillion annually by 2030. Even a small percentage would represent substantial transaction volume. Second, regulatory frameworks must evolve to provide clearer guidelines. The lack of regulatory certainty currently limits institutional investment. Several legislative proposals in major economies could address this issue. Their passage and implementation would remove significant barriers to adoption. Third, technological advancements must continue improving XRP’s utility. The development team regularly updates the XRP Ledger with new features. These enhancements address scalability, security, and functionality concerns. Successful implementation maintains XRP’s competitive advantage against newer payment cryptocurrencies. Comparative Analysis with Other Payment Cryptocurrencies XRP competes in the payment-focused cryptocurrency segment. Several other projects target similar use cases. Understanding this competitive landscape helps evaluate XRP’s potential market share. Key competitors include established cryptocurrencies and newer blockchain projects. Each offers different technical approaches and partnership strategies. Transaction Speed: XRP processes transactions in 3-5 seconds compared to traditional systems requiring days Cost Efficiency: Average transaction fees remain below $0.01 despite network congestion Energy Consumption: The XRP Ledger uses a consensus mechanism requiring minimal energy compared to proof-of-work systems Institutional Backing: Ripple’s established partnerships with financial institutions provide competitive advantage These characteristics position XRP favorably for institutional adoption. However, competition continues intensifying as blockchain technology evolves. Maintaining technological leadership requires ongoing research and development investment. Expert Perspectives and Market Sentiment Analysis Financial institutions and research firms publish regular analyses of XRP’s potential. These reports consider macroeconomic factors alongside cryptocurrency-specific developments. Recent surveys show growing institutional interest in payment-focused cryptocurrencies. This trend could benefit XRP significantly if regulatory conditions improve. Market sentiment indicators provide additional insight into price direction. Social media analysis, search trends, and derivatives market data all contribute to sentiment measurement. Currently, sentiment appears cautiously optimistic with periods of volatility around regulatory announcements. This pattern likely continues until clearer regulations emerge. Historical analysis reveals that XRP often leads market rallies following positive regulatory developments. This pattern suggests pent-up demand awaiting regulatory clarity. The resolution of major legal cases typically triggers significant price movements. Investors monitor these developments closely for trading signals. Risk Factors and Potential Challenges Several risks could derail optimistic price predictions. Regulatory uncertainty remains the most significant concern. Different jurisdictions continue developing conflicting approaches to cryptocurrency regulation. This fragmentation creates compliance challenges for global payment networks. Technological competition presents another challenge. New blockchain projects constantly emerge with different approaches to payments. Some offer features that XRP currently lacks. Maintaining technological relevance requires continuous innovation and adaptation. Market dynamics also create risks. Cryptocurrency markets remain highly correlated despite diversification efforts. Broader market downturns typically affect all cryptocurrencies regardless of individual fundamentals. This correlation could limit XRP’s upside during general market declines. Conclusion XRP’s path to $5 involves navigating complex regulatory landscapes and accelerating institutional adoption. The cryptocurrency possesses strong fundamentals for cross-border payments, but external factors significantly influence its trajectory. Our XRP price prediction analysis suggests gradual appreciation through 2030 under favorable conditions. Achieving the $5 target requires alignment of regulatory clarity, technological advancement, and market adoption. Investors should monitor regulatory developments and partnership announcements closely, as these factors will likely determine XRP’s price movement in coming years. The cryptocurrency’s unique position in payment infrastructure provides distinct advantages, but realizing its full potential depends on broader market and regulatory evolution. FAQs Q1: What is the most realistic XRP price prediction for 2026? Most analysts project XRP trading between $0.85 and $2.50 in 2026, depending on regulatory developments and adoption rates. The moderate scenario suggests a range of $1.20 to $1.80 based on current trends. Q2: Can XRP realistically reach $5 by 2030? Yes, under specific conditions including regulatory clarity, significant institutional adoption, and technological advancement. The bullish scenario in our analysis suggests this target is achievable if multiple positive factors align. Q3: What are the main factors affecting XRP’s price? Key factors include regulatory decisions, institutional adoption rates, technological developments, broader cryptocurrency market trends, and competition from other payment-focused cryptocurrencies. Q4: How does XRP’s utility affect its price prediction? XRP’s utility as a bridge currency for cross-border payments creates organic demand beyond speculation. Increased real-world usage typically supports price stability and gradual appreciation over time. Q5: What risks could prevent XRP from reaching price targets? Major risks include unfavorable regulatory decisions, technological obsolescence, increased competition, broader market downturns, and failure to achieve sufficient institutional adoption.

According to reports from Wu Blockchain on March 15, 2025, the project will implement a phased unlock schedule designed to balance immediate accessibility with long-term ecosystem stability, while simultaneously launching a competitive staking program. This announcement follows the project’s earlier strategic partnership with World Liberty Financial (WLFI), highlighting SpaceCoin’s growing footprint in the convergence of blockchain and telecommunications. SpaceCoin Airdrop Details and Phased Distribution Schedule The SpaceCoin airdrop distribution plan introduces a structured, two-season approach for releasing SPACE tokens to eligible participants. For Season One, the project will unlock 25% of the allocated tokens immediately at the Token Generation Event (TGE). Consequently, the remaining 75% will distribute in equal monthly installments over the subsequent three months. This gradual release mechanism aims to mitigate potential market volatility often associated with large, instantaneous token unlocks. Furthermore, Season Two of the airdrop will commence precisely one month after the TGE. This phase features a slightly accelerated schedule, with 33.3% of its allocation unlocking each month for three consecutive months. Therefore, the entire airdrop distribution will conclude within a four-month timeframe from the initial TGE. The project’s whitepaper clarifies that eligibility for these airdrops is based on prior engagement, including participation in testnets, liquidity provision, or involvement in the earlier WLFI token swap. Season One: 25% unlocked at TGE, 75% vested monthly over 3 months. Season Two: Begins 1 month post-TGE, 33.3% unlocked monthly for 3 months. Total Timeline: Full distribution completes within 4 months of the TGE. Strategic Context and the Satellite Internet Vision SpaceCoin operates as a decentralized project aiming to leverage blockchain technology and satellite constellations to provide global internet access. The SPACE token serves as the native economic and governance unit within this ecosystem, facilitating transactions, incentivizing network operators, and enabling community-led protocol upgrades. This airdrop initiative strategically expands the token’s holder base, decentralizing ownership ahead of mainnet operations. Industry analysts often compare this model to other decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN). For instance, projects like Helium pioneered token incentives for wireless network coverage. However, SpaceCoin’s focus on satellite infrastructure presents distinct technical and regulatory challenges, alongside a significantly broader potential coverage area. The tokenomics, including this airdrop, are designed to bootstrap a global community of users and supporters who are invested in the network’s long-term success. Expert Analysis on Vesting Schedules and Market Impact Vesting schedules, like the one SpaceCoin employs, are a common tool for managing token supply inflation. “A phased unlock protects early adopters by preventing a sudden flood of sell pressure,” explains Dr. Anya Sharma, a blockchain economist at the Digital Assets Research Institute. “However, the true test is whether the project can deliver enough utility and development progress during the vesting period to encourage holders to retain their tokens rather than liquidate them upon each unlock.” Data from similar airdrop events in 2023 and 2024 shows that projects with clear, ongoing development milestones during their vesting periods experienced 40-60% lower sell-off rates at unlock events. SpaceCoin’s roadmap indicates several technical milestones aligned with its unlock schedule, including the launch of its first pilot satellite cluster and the rollout of its developer SDK. Comparative Airdrop Vesting Structures (2024-2025) Project Immediate Unlock Vesting Period Key Feature SpaceCoin (Season 1) 25% 3 Months Monthly Linear Unlock Project Astra (2024) 10% 24 Months 6-Month Cliff Orbital Chain 0% 12 Months Quarterly Unlocks Staking Program and Partnership Background Alongside the airdrop news, SpaceCoin revealed a limited-time staking program for SPACE token holders. This program offers a 10% Annual Percentage Rate (APR) for participants who lock their tokens in designated smart contracts. Staking typically serves two primary functions: it secures the network by committing tokens to the protocol and provides holders with a yield-generating opportunity, which can incentivize long-term holding rather than short-term trading. This announcement logically follows SpaceCoin’s previous partnership with World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a digital asset banking platform. That collaboration involved a token swap, allowing WLFI users early exposure to the SPACE token. The partnership was framed as a step toward bridging traditional finance with decentralized infrastructure projects. The current staking program may be particularly attractive to those earlier participants looking to generate passive income from their holdings while the satellite network undergoes development. It is important to note that staking rewards are usually generated from protocol emissions or fee revenue. The 10% APR offered by SpaceCoin is competitive within the current market landscape, where rates for established proof-of-stake networks often range between 3% and 7%. However, potential stakers must always consider the smart contract risks and the volatile nature of the underlying asset. Regulatory and Technological Considerations The intersection of satellite technology and cryptocurrency presents a unique regulatory frontier. SpaceCoin’s operations may fall under the purview of both telecommunications regulators and financial authorities like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or its international equivalents. The project’s team has stated its commitment to engaging with regulators, particularly concerning the classification of the SPACE token. Technologically, decentralized satellite internet faces hurdles related to latency, ground station deployment, and cost. While blockchain can efficiently handle coordination and payments, the physical layer of launching and maintaining satellites remains capital-intensive. The success of the SPACE token economy is inherently tied to the project’s ability to overcome these real-world engineering challenges and deliver a functional, competitive service. Conclusion The SpaceCoin airdrop distribution plan represents a carefully structured initiative to decentralize ownership of the SPACE token while managing market dynamics. By implementing a phased unlock over four months and coupling it with a 10% APR staking program, the project aims to reward early supporters and align their incentives with long-term network growth. This move, building upon the foundational WLFI partnership, underscores SpaceCoin’s strategic approach to building a community-driven satellite internet ecosystem. As the Token Generation Event approaches, the market will closely watch the execution of this plan and the subsequent development progress of this ambitious decentralized infrastructure project. FAQs Q1: What is the total percentage of SPACE tokens unlocked immediately at the TGE? A1: For Season One of the airdrop, 25% of the allocated tokens are unlocked immediately at the Token Generation Event. The remainder vests linearly over the next three months. Q2: When does Season Two of the SpaceCoin airdrop begin? A2: Season Two is scheduled to begin exactly one month after the Token Generation Event (TGE). Q3: What is the purpose of the SPACE token staking program? A3: The staking program allows token holders to lock their SPACE to earn rewards (a 10% APR), which helps secure the network and incentivizes long-term participation rather than short-term selling. Q4: How does SpaceCoin’s vesting schedule compare to other projects? A4: SpaceCoin’s schedule is relatively short and linear (3-4 months total), offering quicker access than some projects with year-long cliffs but more gradual than an immediate 100% unlock, aiming to balance accessibility with market stability. Q5: What was the significance of the earlier World Liberty Financial (WLFI) partnership? A5: The WLFI partnership involved a token swap, integrating SpaceCoin with a digital asset banking platform and providing an early distribution channel for the SPACE token ahead of the public airdrop.

In a decision that has drawn bipartisan attention, Comptroller of the Currency Jonathan V. Gould affirmed that the agency will not delay its review of the application submitted by World Liberty Financial (WLF) on January 7. Reports highlighted that US Senator Elizabeth Warren, a ranking member of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, recommended a postponement. She advised that the process be delayed until US President Donald Trump decides to sell his holdings in the cryptocurrency decentralized finance (DeFi) platform. Senator Warren raises concerns about Trump and his family’s participation in WLF In a statement dated Friday, January 23, the head of the OCC, Jonathan Gould, mentioned that the submitted application from WLF will be reviewed under the current regulations. Moreover, he assured that there will be no political or personal financial relationships that would impact the bank charter assessment in any way. Concerning Warren’s letter, Gould declared that, “The OCC plans to fulfill its responsibilities instead of following your request,” further adding that, “The OCC’s charter application process should be neutral and nonpartisan, and under my guidance, it will remain that way.” Meanwhile, the OCC head also affirmed that WLF’s application will face close scrutiny, similar to those the OCC has handled previously. It is worth noting that what triggered Warren to request a delay in the review process was the fact that Trump and his three sons: Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, and Barron Trump are listed on the World Liberty Financial’s website as co-founders. Additionally, the Senator raised concerns regarding the billions in unrealized paper wealth the platform generated for their family. This situation sparked further concerns when WLF submitted an application to expand its cryptocurrency business on January 7. This expansion motive consisted of acquiring permission to internally provide, store, and convert their USD1 stablecoin rather than relying on third-party firms such as BitGo, a digital asset infrastructure and financial services company. The OCC simplifies the process of acquiring national trust banking charters Established in March 2025, USD1 has gained significant popularity as the preferred means of payment, settlement, and treasury tasks internationally. As a result, the stablecoin secured the sixth position in terms of market value after its value rose to $4.2 billion. Regarding WLF’s application for a national trust bank charter, reports highlighted that crypto firms encountered difficulties in attempts to acquire national trust banking charters in the past. However, after several considerations, a major transformation was observed in December last year when the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued five conditional approvals to leading cryptocurrency and blockchain infrastructure companies: Circle, Ripple , Fidelity Digital Assets, BitGo, and Paxos. This shift in decision indicates that the currency regulator is exploring integrating cryptocurrency services into traditional financial frameworks. Meanwhile, in a notice made public earlier last month, the OCC alleged that its decision to issue conditional approvals for BitGo, Fidelity Digital Assets, and Paxos was intended to convert their current state-level trust firms into federally chartered national trust banks. Following this statement, Gould, the Comptroller of the Currency, commented that, “New companies entering the federal banking sector benefit consumers, the banking industry, and the economy.” He added that, “the OCC will keep creating opportunities for both traditional and innovative financial services to ensure that the federal banking system adapts to changes in finance and supports a modern economy.” Sharpen your strategy with mentorship + daily ideas - 30 days free access to our trading program",News|DeFi|TRUMP|U.S.|WLF,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-24 05:30:27

The Cardano ecosystem continues developing while market analysts examine multiple technical and fundamental factors that could influence ADA’s valuation trajectory. Cardano Price Prediction: Analyzing the $2 Milestone Potential Cardano’s journey toward the $2 price point involves complex market dynamics and technological developments. The blockchain platform, founded by Charles Hoskinson, has established itself as a third-generation cryptocurrency with a research-driven approach. Market analysts typically examine several key factors when predicting ADA’s price movement, including network adoption, technological upgrades, and broader cryptocurrency market trends. Historical data shows Cardano reached its all-time high of $3.10 in September 2021 during the previous bull market cycle. However, achieving consistent valuation above $2 requires sustained network growth and increased utility. The cryptocurrency market’s volatility means predictions must consider multiple scenarios rather than providing definitive forecasts. Technical Analysis and Historical Patterns Technical analysts examine Cardano’s price charts for patterns that might indicate future movements. The $2 level represents both a psychological barrier and a significant resistance point based on previous trading activity. Chart patterns from previous cycles suggest that breaking through major resistance levels typically requires substantial trading volume and positive market sentiment. Market capitalization calculations reveal that reaching $2 would require ADA’s market value to increase significantly from current levels. This growth would need to be supported by either increased adoption, reduced circulating supply, or a combination of both factors. The total cryptocurrency market expansion also plays a crucial role in determining individual asset valuations. Cardano’s Fundamental Developments Through 2026 Cardano’s development roadmap includes several key upgrades that could influence ADA’s price trajectory. The blockchain’s transition to a fully decentralized governance model through the Voltaire era represents a significant milestone. This development allows ADA holders to participate directly in network decision-making through voting mechanisms. Additionally, the continued expansion of decentralized applications on the Cardano network contributes to fundamental value. As more developers build on the platform and users engage with dApps, network utility increases. This utility growth typically correlates with increased demand for ADA tokens, which are required for transaction fees and staking operations. The Cardano ecosystem’s focus on academic research and peer-reviewed development distinguishes it from many blockchain projects. This methodological approach aims to create sustainable, long-term solutions rather than rapid feature deployment. Market observers monitor how this development philosophy impacts adoption rates and network security. Market Adoption and Institutional Interest Institutional adoption represents another crucial factor for Cardano’s price potential. Financial institutions increasingly explore blockchain integration for various use cases, including cross-border payments and asset tokenization. Cardano’s regulatory-compliant approach and emphasis on formal verification make it attractive for enterprise applications. Geographic adoption patterns also influence ADA’s market dynamics. Different regions exhibit varying levels of Cardano integration, with some countries embracing the technology more rapidly than others. These regional adoption rates affect overall network growth and token demand across global markets.

Monetary policy decisions by central banks, inflation rates, and global economic growth patterns all influence investor behavior across asset classes. Cryptocurrencies increasingly correlate with traditional financial markets during certain economic conditions. Regulatory developments represent another crucial macroeconomic factor. Governments worldwide continue developing cryptocurrency frameworks that affect adoption, trading, and institutional participation. Clear regulatory guidelines typically support market stability and growth, while uncertain or restrictive policies can create headwinds for price appreciation. Technological innovation beyond blockchain also influences cryptocurrency markets. Advances in quantum computing, artificial intelligence integration, and cybersecurity all potentially impact blockchain security and utility. Cardano’s research-focused approach positions it to adapt to these technological shifts, though the timing and impact remain uncertain. Expert Perspectives and Analytical Models Financial analysts employ various models when predicting cryptocurrency prices. These approaches range from traditional discounted cash flow adaptations to network value metrics specific to blockchain assets. Most experts emphasize the importance of considering multiple scenarios rather than relying on single-point predictions. Historical volatility patterns suggest that cryptocurrency markets experience cyclical behavior with periods of rapid appreciation followed by consolidation or correction. Understanding these cycles helps contextualize price predictions within broader market dynamics. The relationship between Bitcoin dominance and altcoin performance also influences ADA’s potential trajectory. Risk Factors and Market Uncertainties All price predictions involve inherent uncertainties, particularly in rapidly evolving cryptocurrency markets. Several risk factors could impact Cardano’s ability to reach the $2 price level between 2026 and 2030: Technological Challenges: Unexpected difficulties implementing planned upgrades Competitive Pressure: More rapid innovation by competing platforms Regulatory Changes: Unfavorable policy developments in major markets Market Sentiment Shifts: Changes in investor psychology and risk appetite Security Incidents: Successful attacks on the Cardano network or major applications These risks highlight the importance of diversified investment approaches and thorough due diligence. While Cardano’s development team emphasizes security and methodical progress, external factors beyond their control can significantly influence market outcomes. The Role of Community and Governance Cardano’s decentralized governance model represents both an opportunity and a challenge for long-term development. Community voting determines treasury fund allocation and protocol upgrade decisions.

The company announced on January 23, 2025, that it successfully mined 155 BTC during the previous week. Subsequently, Bitdeer executed a strategic sale of 152.7 BTC, resulting in a net addition to its corporate treasury and bringing its total holdings to 1,504.4 BTC. This precise balance between production and liquidation offers a compelling case study in institutional cryptocurrency asset management. Bitdeer BTC Mining Operational Analysis Bitdeer’s weekly production of 155 BTC represents significant computational power and energy investment. The company operates large-scale data centers across strategic global locations, including the United States and Norway. These facilities leverage access to stable, often renewable, energy sources to maintain competitive operational costs. Consequently, the firm’s hash rate contribution to the Bitcoin network remains substantial. Each Bitcoin mined validates transactions and secures the blockchain, a process requiring immense proof-of-work. Furthermore, the regularity of this production report underscores operational consistency, a key metric for investors assessing mining enterprises. The mined Bitcoin enters the company’s financial ecosystem as a primary revenue-generating asset. The Economics of Production and Sale The near-immediate sale of 152.7 BTC, or roughly 98.5% of the week’s production, reveals a deliberate treasury strategy. Companies like Bitdeer must manage cash flow to cover significant operational expenditures (OpEx). These costs primarily include: Energy Consumption: Electricity is the single largest cost for Bitcoin mining. Hardware Maintenance: ASIC miners require cooling and eventual replacement. Infrastructure Costs: Data center leases, security, and network connectivity. Personnel and Administration: Salaries for technical and management staff. By converting the majority of new Bitcoin into fiat currency, Bitdeer ensures liquidity to meet these obligations without needing to dip into its core treasury reserves. This approach mitigates risk during periods of Bitcoin price volatility. Strategic Treasury Management in Cryptocurrency Bitdeer’s updated holdings of 1,504.4 BTC represent a formidable corporate treasury, valued at tens of millions of dollars depending on market prices. This reserve acts as a long-term strategic asset on the company’s balance sheet. Holding such an amount indicates a strong bullish conviction on Bitcoin’s future value from the company’s leadership. However, it also requires sophisticated risk management. The decision to sell most weekly production while holding a large reserve is a hybrid strategy. It balances immediate financial needs with long-term exposure to potential Bitcoin appreciation. Other public mining companies, like Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms, employ varying strategies, from holding all mined Bitcoin to selling significant portions, as shown in the comparison below. Recent Weekly Bitcoin Mining & Sale Strategies (Sample) Company BTC Mined (Approx.) BTC Sold (Approx.) Primary Strategy Bitdeer 155 152.7 High Sell-Through for OpEx Marathon Digital ~1,200 0 Full Accumulation Riot Platforms ~500 ~450 Partial Sale for Growth This table illustrates there is no one-size-fits-all model. Each company’s approach depends on its cash position, debt levels, growth ambitions, and market outlook. Bitdeer’s model suggests a focus on sustainable, cash-flow-positive operations. Expert Insights on Mining Economics Industry analysts often highlight the importance of a mining company’s cost per coin. Firms with access to low-cost, stable power can mine Bitcoin profitably even at lower market prices. Bitdeer’s geographic diversification is a key defensive measure. For instance, during a regional energy price spike, operations can be shifted or scaled in other locations. Moreover, the regular sale of coins provides a predictable revenue stream in traditional currency, which is appealing for financial planning and reporting. This operational transparency, as shown in their weekly public updates, builds trust with shareholders and the market. It demonstrates a mature, accountable approach compared to the opaque operations common in the industry’s earlier years. The Broader Impact on the Bitcoin Network Large, publicly-traded miners like Bitdeer play a crucial role in the Bitcoin ecosystem’s health and security. Their substantial hash power contributes directly to network security, making a 51% attack exponentially more difficult and expensive. Furthermore, their operational decisions can influence market dynamics. The sale of over 150 BTC weekly adds consistent, predictable sell-side pressure to the market. However, this is typically absorbed by institutional and retail demand. The net effect is a contribution to market liquidity and price discovery. Importantly, these companies are also major drivers of innovation in mining hardware and renewable energy integration, pushing the entire industry toward greater efficiency and sustainability. Regulatory and Market Context for 2025 The current regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency mining continues to evolve. In the United States, the SEC’s stance on Bitcoin ETFs has brought more institutional capital into the space, indirectly benefiting miners by validating the asset class. However, potential regulations around energy usage reporting and carbon emissions could impact operations. Bitdeer’s reported activities show compliance and adaptation to this environment. Their business model, which includes cloud mining services for retail clients, also adapts to market demand. As Bitcoin’s halving events periodically reduce the block reward, mining efficiency becomes paramount. Companies must continuously upgrade hardware and optimize operations to maintain profitability, a cycle that favors well-capitalized, professional firms like Bitdeer. Conclusion The recent report from Bitdeer BTC mining operations provides a clear window into the sophisticated mechanics of modern cryptocurrency production. The company’s ability to mine 155 BTC and strategically sell 152.7 BTC within the same week highlights a disciplined, financially-prudent approach. This balance ensures operational continuity, manages market risk, and steadily grows a substantial Bitcoin treasury. As the industry matures, such transparent and strategic management will likely define the leading players. Bitdeer’s actions reinforce its position as a significant and stable contributor to both the Bitcoin network’s security and the evolving digital asset economy. FAQs Q1: What does it mean that Bitdeer “mined” 155 BTC? A1: Mining is the process of using powerful computers to solve complex mathematical problems that validate and secure transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. As a reward for this computational work, which consumes significant electricity, the network grants new Bitcoin to the successful miner. Bitdeer’s 155 BTC represents its share of the global block rewards for that period. Q2: Why would Bitdeer sell almost all the Bitcoin it just mined? A2: The primary reason is to cover operational costs (OpEx) like electricity, hardware maintenance, and salaries, which are paid in traditional fiat currency. Selling a large portion of production ensures the company has immediate cash flow to remain solvent and profitable without needing to sell from its long-term treasury holdings, especially during periods of price volatility. Q3: How significant is a treasury of 1,504.4 BTC for a company like Bitdeer? A3: It is a major strategic asset. This reserve, worth tens of millions of dollars, acts as a long-term investment on the company’s balance sheet. It signals confidence in Bitcoin’s future value and provides a financial cushion. The company can potentially use it as collateral, hold it for appreciation, or sell portions to fund major expansions without taking on excessive debt. Q4: How does Bitdeer’s strategy compare to other major Bitcoin miners? A4: Strategies vary. Some miners, like Marathon Digital, have historically held all mined Bitcoin, betting heavily on long-term price increases. Others, like Bitdeer and Riot Platforms, sell a significant portion to cover costs and fund operations. Bitdeer’s high sell-through rate suggests a strong focus on maintaining positive cash flow and operational stability in the near term. Q5: What is “cloud mining” and how does Bitdeer use it? A5: Cloud mining allows individuals or companies to rent mining power from a large data center operator like Bitdeer without owning or maintaining the physical hardware. Bitdeer operates both proprietary mining for its own treasury and offers cloud mining contracts to clients. This dual model diversifies its revenue streams between direct Bitcoin production and service fees.

Holdings Hit Coinbase,https://bitcoinist.com/gamestop-76m-bitcoin-loss-holdings-coinbase/,"On-chain data from CryptoQuant shows GameStop has deposited its entire Bitcoin stack into Coinbase Prime, a potential sign of selling. GameStop Has Transferred 4,710 BTC To Coinbase Prime In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant has revealed how GameStop just moved all its Bitcoin holdings to Coinbase Prime, the institutional prime brokerage wing of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. GameStop is an American videogame retailer that’s considered the largest chain of its kind in the world. In recent years, the company has seen a decline as physical gaming stores have increasingly lost relevance in the digital era. In 2025, the struggling retailer diversified by adopting a Bitcoin treasury reserve, following in the footsteps of other firms like Strategy. As the chart below, shared by CryptoQuant, shows, the company bought 4,710 BTC between May 14th and 23rd. These purchases involved an average buying price of $107,900 per token, costing GameStop a total of $504 million. It’s also visible in the graph that the company has cleared out all of its wallets recently, with its total holdings dropping to zero. GameStop has made these moves as the asset has gone through a bearish turn since October. As this other chart showcases, the firm’s reserve was trading a notable amount below its investment value before the outflows occurred. According to CryptoQuant, the transfer of GameStop’s holdings to Coinbase Prime could be a sign that the retailer is preparing to sell, a move that would lock in losses of around $76 million at current prices. The potential sale of GameStop’s Bitcoin reserve has come alongside a significant number of store closures. According to a blog that compiles data using the retailer’s online store locator, 470 stores have so far either been confirmed to be closing or closed this January. Back in 2021, GameStop was the highlight of a “meme stock” frenzy, in which its share price saw a 1,500% spike alongside a short squeeze over the course of two weeks. Later in that year, the company decided to take a gamble on a non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace, attempting to ride the NFT craze of the period. Its platform hit the market in 2022, but it wasn’t long before GameStop started winding it down, and ultimately shuttered its doors in early 2024.

Despite the pullback, several on‑chain and market indicators are pointing to a possible breakout from current levels, driven largely by a sharp decline in XRP held on exchanges. XRP Exchange Balances Slide To 1.5B Market analyst Sam Daodu notes that over the past months, a substantial portion of XRP has steadily moved off centralized trading platforms and into long‑term storage and institutional custody. On‑chain figures indicate that XRP exchange balances dropped from roughly 4 billion tokens in early 2025 to about 1.5 billion by late December. This 57% decline represents the steepest annual reduction in XRP exchange supply on record. Related Reading: Binance Forms New Company In Greece, Moves Forward With MiCA Licensing Data from CryptoQuant reinforces this trend, showing shrinking XRP reserves on major trading platforms such as Binance, where balances continued to fall into early 2026. At the same time, wallet accumulation has increased, particularly among institutional custody accounts. Daodu argues that with fewer tokens available on exchanges, buying pressure that previously moved XRP only marginally can now drive gains of 10% to 15% within days. When combined with approximately $1.37 billion in XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows recorded since November 2025, Daodu believes the conditions favor a potential breakout toward the $4 to $5 range, rather than another rally that stalls below $3. Bullish, Base, And Bearish Scenarios Looking ahead, Daodu outlines three broad price paths for XRP, each tied to how exchange balances and ETF inflows evolve. In a bullish scenario, the altcoin could move into the $4 to $5 range if monthly ETF inflows average $300-$500 million and exchange balances fall below 1.5 billion tokens. A more neutral outcome would see XRP trading between $2.50 and $3.50. This scenario assumes ETF inflows slow to roughly $50 million to $70 million per week and exchange balances continue to decline at a steadier pace. Related Reading: Expert Analyzes XRP, Ethereum, And Solana: Predictions For The Next Altcoin Season The bearish case hinges on the possibility that the supply contraction thesis proves overstated. If rapid transfers refill exchange order books, escrow releases increase selling pressure, or ETF demand slows due to tighter macroeconomic conditions, XRP could lose support. In that scenario, prices may fall below $2.00 and revisit the $1.60 level during periods of risk aversion. Prolonged uncertainty could see XRP trading between $1.50 and $2.00 for much of 2026, according to the analyst. At the time of writing, the altcoin was trading at $1.94. This represented losses of 4% and 8% over seven and fourteen-day periods, respectively. This positions the fifth-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market cap 46% below the current all-time high of $3.64 reached back in July of last year.

This substantial movement, valued at approximately $300 million, represents one of the most significant single-transaction stablecoin inflows to a major exchange this quarter. Consequently, analysts and traders are now scrutinizing the potential implications for market liquidity and price action. USDC Transfer Analysis: Deconstructing the $300 Million Binance Movement The blockchain analytics platform Whale Alert first reported this transaction. The funds originated from a single, unidentified wallet address. This address lacked any publicly known affiliation with institutional entities or venture capital firms. The transfer executed seamlessly on the Ethereum network, incurring a standard gas fee. Such a direct, high-value move to a centralized exchange like Binance typically precedes several possible actions. For instance, the holder may intend to trade for other assets, provide liquidity, or participate in exclusive exchange offerings. To understand the scale, consider this comparison with recent activity. The table below outlines notable stablecoin transfers to centralized exchanges (CEXs) in early 2025. Date Amount Stablecoin Destination Mar 10, 2025 150M USDT Coinbase Mar 15, 2025 85M DAI Kraken Mar 21, 2025 300M USDC Binance This transaction stands out for its sheer size and its use of USDC. As a fully regulated stablecoin issued by Circle, USDC is often the instrument of choice for large, compliance-conscious entities. Therefore, this move carries different connotations than a similar transfer in Tether (USDT) might. Context and Background of Major Crypto Whale Transactions Historically, massive stablecoin inflows to exchanges have served as a leading indicator for market volatility. They increase the immediate buying power available on the platform. Analysts often interpret these deposits as preparatory steps for large purchases. However, alternative explanations exist. The entity could be an over-the-counter (OTC) desk facilitating a client trade, a fund rebalancing its treasury, or even a protocol moving funds for operational purposes. Furthermore, the “unknown wallet” aspect is crucial. Blockchain is transparent, but identity is not. The wallet’s history would reveal its behavioral patterns. For example, was it newly funded? Did it receive funds from known institutional addresses? Was this a one-time event or part of a series? These are the questions blockchain sleuths investigate. Meanwhile, the timing is also noteworthy. It occurred amidst a period of relative consolidation for Bitcoin and Ethereum, following a bullish first quarter. Expert Insights on Market Impact and Motives Market veterans emphasize the need for cautious interpretation. “A single transaction, while eye-catching, is not a definitive market signal,” notes a veteran analyst from a blockchain intelligence firm. “We must correlate it with order book depth, derivatives market data, and broader capital flow trends. The key is whether this USDC gets converted into spot assets like BTC or ETH, or if it remains as stablecoin liquidity.” Evidence from past cycles shows varied outcomes. In some cases, similar deposits preceded aggressive buying that pushed prices higher. In others, the funds were used to short the market via perpetual futures contracts. The intent often becomes clear within 24-48 hours through on-chain tracking of subsequent transactions from the receiving Binance wallet. Regulatory developments also provide context. Increased clarity in major economies like the EU and the U.S. has prompted more institutional capital to use compliant stablecoins like USDC for entry and exit. Potential Implications for Traders and the Broader Ecosystem For active traders, this event triggers several monitoring protocols. First, they watch Binance’s BTC/USDC and ETH/USDC order books for large bid walls. Second, they observe funding rates in the perpetual swap markets for signs of building leverage. Third, they track the flow of funds from Binance’s hot wallets to cold storage, which can indicate exchange net flows. The broader implications are significant: Liquidity Injection: Adds substantial stablecoin liquidity to Binance, potentially lowering slippage for large trades. Market Sentiment: Can be perceived as bullish (fuel for buying) or bearish (preparation for selling pressure). Stablecoin Dominance: Reinforces USDC’s role as a primary settlement layer for large-scale crypto finance. Regulatory Scrutiny: Highlights the traceability of such transactions, supporting arguments for transparent blockchain analytics over traditional finance. Ultimately, the market’s reaction will depend on revealed intent. The coming days will provide more data points. Will the entity accumulate blue-chip cryptocurrencies? Will it provide liquidity for a new launchpad project? Or will the funds move to another venue? The blockchain ledger will disclose all answers in due time. Conclusion The 300 million USDC transfer to Binance is a powerful reminder of the scale and transparency of modern digital asset markets. This transaction underscores the critical importance of on-chain analysis for understanding market structure. While the immediate motive remains unknown, the movement significantly alters the liquidity landscape on one of the world’s largest exchanges. Market participants should therefore focus on corroborating data rather than speculating. The true impact of this USDC transfer will be determined by the subsequent on-chain actions it enables. FAQs Q1: What does a large USDC transfer to Binance usually mean? Typically, it signals that a major holder is preparing to execute a large trade. They need stablecoins on the exchange to buy other cryptocurrencies or to participate in specific financial products offered on the platform. Q2: Why is the wallet “unknown” if blockchain is transparent? Blockchain shows the wallet address and all its transactions, but linking that address to a real-world identity (like a company or person) is difficult without that entity publicly announcing it or using a known, labeled address. Q3: Could this transaction be related to an OTC deal? Yes, it’s a strong possibility. Large over-the-counter trades often settle by moving stablecoins to an exchange as one step in the process, allowing the counterparty to withdraw the assets easily. Q4: How does this affect the price of Bitcoin or Ethereum? It doesn’t directly affect the price until the USDC is used to place buy or sell orders. However, it increases the potential buying pressure on the exchange, which can influence trader psychology and market sentiment in the short term. Q5: Is USDC different from other stablecoins in this context? Yes. USDC is issued by regulated financial institutions and is often preferred by institutions and funds that prioritize compliance. A large USDC move can sometimes imply involvement from a more traditional finance-oriented entity compared to other stablecoins.

57428729,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=265101,1769235310,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin ETF Outflows Spark Concern: $103.5M Exit Marks Fifth Straight Day of Withdrawals,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-etf-outflows-fifth-day/,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin ETF Outflows Spark Concern: $103.5M Exit Marks Fifth Straight Day of Withdrawals In a significant shift for the nascent cryptocurrency investment sector, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs witnessed a collective net outflow of $103.5 million on January 23, 2025, extending a concerning trend to five consecutive days of negative flows according to data from Farside Investors. This persistent withdrawal pattern, notably led by industry titans BlackRock and Fidelity, raises critical questions about short-term investor sentiment and the maturation of these landmark financial products. Bitcoin ETF Outflows: A Detailed Breakdown of the Fifth Day The data for January 23 reveals a clear narrative. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), a dominant force since its launch, accounted for the vast majority of the day’s exit, recording a substantial single-day outflow of $101.6 million. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) contributed a smaller, yet notable, withdrawal of $1.9 million. This activity resulted in the fifth straight session where redemptions exceeded creations across the spot Bitcoin ETF complex. Consequently, analysts are now scrutinizing this streak against the historical inflows that characterized the products’ explosive debut period just over a year prior. The Broader Market Context and Historical Comparison To understand the impact, one must examine the timeline. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first batch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, triggering an initial wave of massive institutional and retail investment. For months, funds like IBIT and FBTC consistently saw net positive inflows, often measured in the hundreds of millions daily. Therefore, a five-day outflow sequence represents a notable deviation. Market observers point to several concurrent factors: potential profit-taking after a price rally, rotating investor interest into other asset classes, or broader macroeconomic uncertainty influencing risk appetite. This context is crucial for a balanced analysis. Analyzing the Drivers Behind Persistent Withdrawals Several evidence-based factors could explain this trend. First, Bitcoin’s price action often directly influences ETF flows. A period of consolidation or correction following a gain can trigger profit-taking through these liquid ETF vehicles. Second, the macroeconomic environment plays a role. Shifts in interest rate expectations or dollar strength can pressure all risk assets, including crypto proxies. Third, internal fund dynamics matter. Some early investors may be rebalancing portfolios after the initial allocation phase. Finally, competition is emerging. The success of spot Bitcoin ETFs has paved the way for filings around spot Ether ETFs, potentially causing some capital to reposition in anticipation. Key potential drivers include: Profit-taking behavior after a significant asset price increase. Broader financial market volatility and shifting risk sentiment. Natural portfolio rebalancing by institutional allocators. Evolving regulatory news and its impact on investor confidence. Expert Perspectives on ETF Flow Dynamics Financial analysts specializing in exchange-traded products emphasize that flow volatility is normal, especially for new asset classes. “While five days of outflows capture attention, it’s essential to view them within the multi-billion-dollar net inflow story since launch,” notes a veteran ETF strategist. “These products provide unprecedented transparency. We can now see real-time institutional sentiment shifts that were previously opaque.” Furthermore, the concentrated outflows from the largest funds suggest this may be a specific reallocation event rather than a wholesale abandonment of the Bitcoin ETF thesis. The long-term test will be whether flows stabilize and resume a growth trajectory. The Impact on Bitcoin Price and Market Structure The relationship between ETF flows and the underlying Bitcoin price is symbiotic. Substantial net inflows typically create buying pressure on the spot market, as authorized participants must acquire Bitcoin to back new shares. Conversely, sustained outflows can impose selling pressure. The recent $103.5 million exit, while meaningful, represents a fraction of the total assets under management (AUM) held by these ETFs, which collectively exceed $40 billion. Thus, the direct market impact may be muted. However, the psychological impact is significant. Continuous outflow data can influence trader sentiment and potentially exacerbate short-term price movements, creating a feedback loop that experts monitor closely. Conclusion The fifth consecutive day of Bitcoin ETF outflows , totaling $103.5 million on January 23, serves as a pivotal moment for market observers. Led by withdrawals from BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC, this trend highlights the evolving and sometimes volatile nature of capital allocation in cryptocurrency investment vehicles. While not indicative of a structural failure, these flows provide transparent, real-time insight into institutional sentiment and market mechanics. Ultimately, monitoring these patterns will remain essential for understanding the long-term integration of Bitcoin into the global regulated financial system. FAQs Q1: What does “net outflow” mean for a Bitcoin ETF? A1: A net outflow occurs when the dollar value of shares redeemed by investors exceeds the value of new shares created on a given day. It indicates more money is leaving the ETF than entering it. Q2: Why are outflows from BlackRock’s IBIT particularly significant? A2: IBIT is the largest spot Bitcoin ETF by assets. Major moves in this fund often signal broader institutional behavior and can have a disproportionate impact on overall market sentiment and liquidity. Q3: Could these outflows cause the price of Bitcoin to fall? A3: They can contribute to downward pressure. To fulfill redemptions, authorized participants may sell Bitcoin from the ETF’s holdings. However, many other factors also influence Bitcoin’s price. Q4: Is a five-day outflow streak unusual for new ETFs? A4: Periods of outflow are common for all ETFs, even successful ones. For a new and volatile asset class like cryptocurrency, such volatility in flows is expected as the market finds equilibrium. Q5: Where does the outflow data come from, and is it reliable? A5: Firms like Farside Investors compile this data from public disclosures by the ETF issuers and national exchanges. It is considered highly reliable and is published daily for market transparency.

Spot Ethereum ETFs Grapple with Sustained Withdrawals Data from the prominent analytics firm Farside Investors reveals a clear pattern of capital exit from spot Ethereum ETFs. This multi-day outflow event, concentrated in late January 2025, marks one of the most prolonged periods of net negative movement for these funds since their landmark approval and launch. The consistent withdrawals suggest a recalibration among institutional and retail investors, potentially driven by broader macroeconomic factors or specific developments within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Consequently, fund managers now face the challenge of stabilizing assets under management during this phase of apparent consolidation. Breaking Down the January 23 Outflow Figures The daily snapshot from Farside provides a detailed breakdown of the outflows, highlighting divergent performances among the major fund issuers. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), one of the largest and most closely watched products, experienced a significant single-day outflow of $44.5 million. Simultaneously, Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) saw outflows of $10.8 million. However, Grayscale’s newer and lower-fee Mini Ethereum Trust (ETH) partially counteracted this trend by attracting a net inflow of $9.2 million. This internal shift indicates that cost-conscious investors may be moving capital between products from the same provider to optimize for expense ratios, even during a broader withdrawal period. Contextualizing the Outflow Trend To understand this trend, one must consider the lifecycle of cryptocurrency ETPs. Initial launch periods often generate substantial inflows driven by pent-up demand and novelty. After this phase, flows typically become more reactive to external market drivers such as Ethereum’s price volatility, regulatory news, interest rate expectations, and the performance of competing asset classes like equities or bonds. The four-day outflow pattern in January 2025 may reflect a response to specific events, including potential regulatory clarifications from the SEC, movements in the underlying ETH price, or profit-taking after a period of accumulation. Historical data from spot Bitcoin ETFs shows similar periods of consolidation following initial surge phases, suggesting this may be a standard maturation process for crypto-based investment vehicles. Comparative Analysis with Bitcoin ETF Flows The behavior of spot Ethereum ETFs often draws comparisons to their Bitcoin counterparts, which have a longer track record. While Bitcoin ETFs have also experienced periods of outflows, they have generally demonstrated stronger cumulative net inflows over time. The recent pressure on ETH funds could highlight a divergence in investor perception between the two leading cryptocurrencies. Some analysts point to factors like Ethereum’s evolving transition to a full proof-of-stake consensus, ongoing upgrades like Dencun, and its utility in decentralized finance (DeFi) as variables that create a different risk-reward profile compared to Bitcoin’s digital gold narrative. This differentiation directly influences fund flow dynamics. Key factors influencing ETF flows include: Underlying Asset Performance: Daily changes in the price of ETH. Macroeconomic Environment: Shifts in interest rates and inflation expectations. Regulatory Landscape: Statements or actions from the SEC or other regulators. Competitive Fund Launches: New products with lower fees or novel structures. General Market Sentiment: The overall risk-on or risk-off appetite of investors. The Role of Fees and Product Differentiation The contrasting flow between Grayscale’s ETHE and its Mini ETH fund underscores the critical importance of management fees in this competitive market. The higher-fee ETHE product has historically battled outflows as investors seek more cost-efficient exposure. The mini fund’s ability to attract inflows amidst a sector-wide downturn is a powerful testament to this fee sensitivity. This dynamic pressures all issuers to continuously evaluate their fee structures to retain and attract capital. Furthermore, product differentiation beyond fees—such as staking yield integration for Ethereum ETFs—remains a topic of intense discussion and could be a future catalyst for flow reversals if approved by regulators. Expert Perspective on Market Phases Market analysts often describe the flow patterns of new financial instruments as moving through distinct phases: adoption, normalization, and maturity. The current outflow trend for spot Ethereum ETFs likely represents the normalization phase, where initial excitement subsides and flows become dictated by fundamental and technical factors rather than novelty. This phase is crucial for establishing a stable baseline of assets under management. Data from traditional finance indicates that ETFs surviving this normalization phase often go on to see sustained, long-term growth as they become entrenched components of investor portfolios. Potential Implications for the Ethereum Ecosystem Sustained outflows from spot ETFs, while concerning for fund issuers in the short term, do not necessarily reflect a negative long-term outlook for Ethereum itself. The ETFs represent just one channel for institutional exposure. However, large-scale redemptions can create indirect selling pressure on the underlying market if the authorized participants facilitating the ETF creation/redemption process need to sell ETH to raise cash. Monitoring the relationship between ETF flow data and on-chain exchange flows provides a more complete picture of net market selling pressure. The resilience of the Ethereum network, measured by metrics like active addresses, transaction volume, and total value locked in DeFi, often provides a more fundamental health check than secondary market fund flows alone. Conclusion The fourth consecutive day of net outflows from U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs, totaling $41.7 million on January 23, 2025, highlights a period of reassessment for this investment vehicle class. While leading funds from BlackRock and Grayscale faced withdrawals, the inflow into Grayscale’s lower-cost mini fund reveals an active, fee-sensitive investor base. These spot Ethereum ETF outflows represent a natural maturation phase following their launch, influenced by fees, market sentiment, and the performance of the underlying ETH asset. As the market digests this data, the long-term success of these products will depend on their ability to offer efficient, compliant exposure to Ethereum’s evolving value proposition, navigating both crypto-native and traditional financial currents. FAQs Q1: What does a “net outflow” mean for an ETF? A1: A net outflow occurs when the total value of shares redeemed from an ETF exceeds the total value of shares created or purchased on a given day. It indicates that more investors are withdrawing money from the fund than are adding money. Q2: Why is Grayscale’s Mini ETH fund seeing inflows while its main ETHE fund sees outflows? A2: The primary reason is the significant difference in management fees. The Mini ETH fund charges a much lower fee, prompting cost-conscious investors to shift their capital from the higher-fee ETHE product to maintain exposure to Ethereum at a lower cost. Q3: Do ETF outflows directly cause the price of Ethereum to drop? A3: Not directly, but they can contribute to selling pressure. When shares are redeemed, the authorized participant may need to sell some of the underlying ETH held by the fund to pay the redeeming investor, which can increase sell orders on the market. Q4: Is a four-day outflow trend unusual for a new ETF? A4: It is not uncommon. New ETFs often experience volatile flows after their launch period as the market finds an equilibrium. Periods of outflows can follow initial inflows as early investors take profits or rebalance portfolios. Q5: Where can investors find reliable data on daily ETF flows? A5: Analytics firms like Farside Investors, Bloomberg, and ETF.com compile and publish daily flow data for ETFs, including cryptocurrency funds. Fund issuers like BlackRock and Grayscale also report assets under management (AUM) figures, from which flow trends can be inferred.

57428964,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=265107,1769236211,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Ethereum Quantum Security: Foundation Launches Urgent Post-Quantum Team to Shield Billions,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ethereum-quantum-security-post-quantum-team/,"BitcoinWorld Ethereum Quantum Security: Foundation Launches Urgent Post-Quantum Team to Shield Billions In a decisive move to safeguard the future of the world’s second-largest blockchain, the Ethereum Foundation has officially launched a dedicated Post-Quantum team. This strategic initiative, announced in Zurich, Switzerland, on March 15, 2025, directly counters the looming threat quantum computing poses to cryptographic security. Consequently, the foundation is mobilizing developers and researchers to future-proof a network securing over $500 billion in value. Ethereum Quantum Security Becomes a Core Priority The Ethereum Foundation has formally elevated quantum resistance to a core strategic priority. This decision reflects a proactive stance within the blockchain industry. Quantum computers, which leverage quantum mechanics, threaten to break the cryptographic algorithms that secure digital wallets and transaction signatures. Therefore, the foundation’s new Post-Quantum team will coordinate a multi-pronged defense strategy. This team will immediately begin hosting bi-weekly developer sessions. These sessions aim to enhance user wallet security through collaborative discussions. Key discussion topics will include advanced in-protocol cryptographic tools, secure account abstraction pathways, and efficient signature aggregation structures. Moreover, this initiative represents a significant shift from theoretical concern to practical implementation. The foundation recognizes that quantum advancements, while still emerging, could eventually compromise current encryption standards like ECDSA. As a result, early preparation is critical for maintaining long-term trust and asset security on the Ethereum network. Mobilizing Research with Substantial Financial Backing Parallel to its operational efforts, the Ethereum Foundation is making a major financial commitment to foundational research. Specifically, the organization has allocated $2 million in prize funding to accelerate quantum-resistant cryptography. This funding targets two critical areas of development essential for Ethereum quantum security. The Poseidon Prize ($1 million): This prize focuses on strengthening the Poseidon hash function. Poseidon is a zk-SNARK-friendly hash function crucial for Ethereum’s layer-2 scaling and privacy solutions like zk-Rollups. Enhancing its quantum resistance is vital for the entire scalability ecosystem. The Proximity Prize ($1 million): Dedicated to broader research into quantum-resistant technology, this prize encourages innovation in post-quantum cryptography (PQC). PQC involves creating new algorithms that even powerful quantum computers cannot easily break. This dual approach ensures both immediate protocol components and long-term cryptographic standards receive dedicated support. Furthermore, it incentivizes global academic and cryptographic research communities to contribute directly to blockchain security. The Looming Quantum Threat Timeline Experts generally agree that cryptographically relevant quantum computers are likely years, if not decades, away. However, the “harvest now, decrypt later” attack vector presents a clear and present danger. In this scenario, a malicious actor could record encrypted blockchain transactions today and decrypt them later once a quantum computer is available. This risk makes preemptive action not just prudent but essential for protecting long-lived assets and smart contracts. The table below outlines the primary cryptographic elements at risk and the general timeline of concern: Cryptographic Element Use in Ethereum Quantum Vulnerability Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) Secures transactions and wallet ownership. High – Shor’s algorithm could break it. Keccak-256 (SHA-3) Core hashing function for block integrity. Moderate – Grover’s algorithm halves its security. zk-SNARKs Proof Systems Enables private and scalable layer-2 solutions. Varies – Depends on underlying cryptographic assumptions. Transitioning these systems requires extensive research, testing, and community coordination. The Ethereum Foundation’s team will spearhead this complex technical migration. Industry Context and the Race for Quantum Resistance The Ethereum Foundation’s announcement places it at the forefront of a broader industry-wide awakening. Notably, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has been standardizing post-quantum cryptographic algorithms for several years. Several blockchain projects are now exploring integrations with these NIST-finalized algorithms. Ethereum’s approach, however, is uniquely comprehensive. It combines immediate developer education with long-term research grants. This strategy acknowledges that a successful transition depends on more than just new algorithms. It requires seamless integration into wallets, smart contracts, and the core protocol without disrupting user experience or decentralization. Additionally, the foundation’s public commitment provides a clear signal to enterprises and institutional investors. It demonstrates that Ethereum’s governance is actively managing long-term existential risks. This action could influence other major blockchain ecosystems to accelerate their own quantum preparedness roadmaps. Expert Perspectives on the Proactive Move Cryptography experts view the foundation’s initiative as a necessary and timely step. Dr. Anna Kramer, a post-quantum cryptography researcher cited in the original CoinDesk report, emphasized the importance of early-stage development. “Cryptographic transitions are measured in decades, not years,” she stated. “Beginning this work now, while quantum threats are still theoretical, provides the necessary runway for robust, community-vetted solutions.” This expert insight underscores the foresight behind the launch. The foundation is not responding to an immediate breach but building a defensive moat years in advance. Conclusion The launch of the Ethereum Foundation’s Post-Quantum team marks a pivotal moment for blockchain security. By declaring Ethereum quantum security a strategic priority, allocating significant resources, and mobilizing its developer community, the foundation is taking definitive action. This proactive defense against future quantum computing threats aims to protect the network’s integrity, user assets, and foundational promise of decentralized trust. The journey to a quantum-resistant Ethereum will be complex and collaborative. However, this structured initiative provides a critical framework for ensuring the blockchain’s resilience for decades to come. FAQs Q1: What is the main goal of the Ethereum Foundation’s new Post-Quantum team? The primary goal is to research, develop, and implement quantum-resistant cryptographic solutions for the Ethereum blockchain. This protects user wallets and network integrity from future threats posed by advanced quantum computers. Q2: How soon do we need quantum-resistant cryptography for Ethereum? While powerful quantum computers are not imminent, the “harvest now, decrypt later” threat requires immediate action. Transitioning cryptography is a multi-year process, so starting now is essential for a secure transition before threats materialize. Q3: What are the Poseidon and Proximity Prizes? These are two $1 million research prizes funded by the Ethereum Foundation. The Poseidon Prize strengthens the quantum resistance of the Poseidon hash function. The Proximity Prize funds general research into quantum-resistant technology for blockchain. Q4: Will upgrading to quantum-resistant cryptography require users to take action? Ideally, the transition will be seamless for most users through protocol-level upgrades. However, wallet providers and smart contract developers will likely need to update their software to support new cryptographic standards in the future.

The post highlighted Hoskinson’s response to criticism from parts of the XRP community . The remarks were delivered in a video captioned in the post and focused on clarifying Hoskinson’s position toward the XRP community, explaining why reactions to certain comments have at times been heightened. The exchange reflects ongoing sensitivities within the digital asset space, particularly where regulatory history and prominent industry figures intersect. Charles Hoskinson responds to criticism from the XRP community: There’s no issue with the XRPL community. They’re great people. The sensitivity comes from the SEC lawsuit and past history. Any criticism of Brad gets made bigger than it really is. pic.twitter.com/7LfPUDkcJO — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) January 22, 2026 Hoskinson’s View on the XRPL Community In the video referenced by Xaif Crypto, Hoskinson emphasized that he does not hold negative views toward the XRPL community. He described members of that community as constructive participants in the broader digital asset sector and rejected the idea of an underlying conflict between Cardano and XRPL supporters. According to Hoskinson, the perception of hostility often arises not from substantive disagreement, but from how criticism is interpreted and amplified. He explained that reactions are frequently shaped by the long-running regulatory pressures faced by XRP , particularly the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit and earlier industry disputes. In Hoskinson’s view, this history has contributed to an atmosphere where comments, especially those involving figures such as Brad Garlinghouse, are sometimes received with greater intensity than intended. He suggested that criticism in a general or policy-focused context can be interpreted as personal or adversarial due to these lingering tensions. Regulatory History and the Clarity Act Hoskinson also referenced legislative efforts, including the Clarity Act , to illustrate how complex policy discussions can become mischaracterized. He noted that the act began with what he considered a solid initial structure, but later underwent extensive changes through numerous amendments. This point was raised to underscore how nuanced regulatory conversations can be reduced to simplified narratives, which then feed into broader misunderstandings between communities. By highlighting this example, Hoskinson appeared to argue that disagreements over regulation or governance should not be viewed as attacks on specific projects or communities. Instead, he framed them as part of a necessary, and often messy, process of developing clearer rules for the digital asset industry.

While identifying as an XRP holder , the commenter argued that some community members can become overly influenced by the opinions and behavior of prominent figures, rather than forming independent judgments. He further stated his belief that Hoskinson and Brian Armstrong are advocating for the interests of everyday participants in the space, rather than acting against specific projects. Overall, the exchange reflects a continuing effort by industry leaders to address misunderstandings between different digital asset communities. Hoskinson’s remarks, as presented by Xaif Crypto, focused on reducing perceived friction and encouraging a more measured interpretation of criticism, particularly in a sector still shaped by unresolved regulatory history.

Dogecoin Could Be Trading Inside A Falling Wedge Pattern In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has shared a Falling Wedge that Dogecoin is potentially trading inside on the weekly timeframe. A “Wedge” is a pattern from technical analysis (TA) that forms whenever the asset’s price trades between two converging trendlines. A “Triangle” consolidation channel also involves converging trendlines, but the difference from a Wedge is that it either involves one trendline that’s horizontally flat or trendlines that converge with an opposite slope. On the other hand, a Wedge involves trendlines sloped in the same direction. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply Overhang Likely To Cap Rallies Above $98,400, Glassnode Says When these lines point in the up direction, the pattern formed is known as a Rising Wedge. Similarly, their being sloped downward creates a Falling Wedge. The latter is the Wedge of interest in the current discussion. Like other consolidation patterns in TA, the upper line of a Falling Wedge is also likely to be a source of resistance, while the lower one is that of support. A breakout of either of these bounds can signal a sustained move in that direction. Wedges are generally considered to be either continuation or reversal patterns, depending on the prevailing price trend. When a Falling Wedge is preceded by an upward price trajectory, the pattern is assumed to be one pertaining to a bullish continuation. Similarly, it acts as a reversal pattern during a downtrend. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the Falling Wedge that Dogecoin has been stuck inside for the past year: As displayed in the above graph, Dogecoin’s weekly price has retraced to the lower level of the Falling Wedge recently, suggesting the pattern’s support is being retested. In the same chart, the analyst has highlighted some Falling Wedges that Dogecoin traveled through in the past. It would appear that each of these ended up holding as bullish continuation patterns and led to upward breakouts. In terms of the width, the latest Wedge has been the largest among these. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Whiplash: Mood Sours From Greed To Extreme Fear In Days “Dogecoin $DOGE tends to respect wedge structures, and a breakout from this one could be powerful,” noted Martinez. It now remains to be seen whether the support line of the channel will hold for the memecoin this time and if a breakout will follow. DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is floating around $0.125, down more than 9% over the last seven days.

With momentum weakening and volatility picking up, traders are now watching whether this pullback becomes a temporary reset or the start of a deeper downside move. Analysts remain divided on the outlook, as some argue XRP is entering a bearish continuation phase, while others believe the market is simply clearing leverage before a rebound. Either way, the coming sessions are shaping up to be decisive for short-term direction. A report from Arab Chain adds an important layer of context by focusing on Binance flow dynamics. According to the report, data from Binance’s XRP platform shows the 30-day correlation between price and CVD (Cumulative Volume Delta) sitting near 0.61, which signals a moderate to strong positive relationship between price action and net volume flows. In simple terms, XRP’s recent moves have not been disconnected from trading activity. Instead, price changes appear to be relatively supported by actual volume behavior rather than isolated technical noise. This matters because when price and CVD remain positively linked, the market is often viewed as structurally aligned, suggesting trend confirmation rather than a random bounce. For XRP, this correlation could become a key signal as bulls fight to defend $1.90. XRP’s CVD Confirmation Score Shows Base-Building, Not Capitulation Arab Chain explains that while the 30-day price–CVD correlation remains positive, the latest CVD reading is still relatively negative, signaling that accumulated selling pressure has not yet flipped into net buying dominance. This is a critical nuance. Rather than acting like a simple “buy” or “sell” trigger, the metric functions as a confirmation score, meaning it evaluates whether price action is internally supported by volume flows instead of offering a clean entry signal. In other words, it helps traders judge the quality of the trend and whether market behavior is coherent beneath the surface. The real value of this framework is its ability to detect divergence early. If XRP’s price attempts to recover while correlation deteriorates, or if CVD stays negative during upside moves, it would suggest hidden weakness and a higher probability that rallies are being sold into. That kind of imbalance often appears before sharp reversals, especially in uncertain conditions where liquidity is thin and momentum-driven positioning dominates. In the current context, however, the market is sending a more balanced message. The persistence of a positive correlation despite ongoing price weakness implies that XRP may be entering a base-building phase, where selling pressure is being absorbed gradually rather than accelerating into aggressive distribution. Trend Weakness Keeps Bulls On Defense XRP is trading near $1.91 on the 3-day chart after failing to reclaim the $2.00 level, keeping the market in a fragile short-term position. The structure shows that XRP topped above $3.50 during the mid-2025 rally, but the move has since unraveled into a steady downtrend defined by lower highs and repeated breakdowns. After the sharp leg lower in October, the price attempted to stabilize, but the recovery lacked follow-through and has gradually faded into a tighter compression zone. From a trend perspective, XRP remains capped below its major moving averages. The blue average is sloping downward and sits above price near the mid-$2 range, reinforcing a bearish bias and limiting upside attempts. The green average is also flattening and rolling over, confirming that momentum has weakened across multiple timeframes. Meanwhile, XRP is now leaning directly on the red long-term average, which is rising toward the current price and acting as a key support reference around the $1.85–$1.90 region. Price action over the last several candles suggests a base-building process, but it is still premature to call a reversal. Bulls need to defend this support zone and reclaim $2.00–$2.10 to shift momentum back in their favor. If XRP loses the rising long-term average, downside risk increases toward $1.70 and potentially the mid-$1.50 area, where demand previously stepped in.

He shared a video featuring Sal Gilbertie, CEO of Teucrium, discussing developments that could redefine Ripple’s role in global finance. The focus is on two pivotal factors: the Clarity Act and a potential Ripple banking license. Clarity Act as a Milestone Gilbertie emphasized the Clarity Act as a milestone for decentralized finance. He noted, “The transition of TradFi to DeFi will be defined and accelerated when that passes.” This legislation could create a regulatory environment that enables digital assets and DeFi platforms to integrate more fully with traditional financial systems. Ripple, with its existing XRP holdings, stands to benefit directly from these changes. However, the Clarity Act is facing criticism from key players in the crypto industry. Coinbase has withdrawn its support , and others, such as Charles Hoskinson, have criticized Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse for supporting it. BREAKING As banks move to suppress stablecoin yields, a much larger shift is taking shape. Ripple and $XRP are positioning to become a core pillar of global financial capital. This goes well beyond the Clarity Act. The system is moving. The play is already live. pic.twitter.com/RjGwgJe2tv — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) January 22, 2026 Potential Ripple Banking License A more immediate development, according to Gilbertie, is the prospect of Ripple receiving a banking license. He stated, “If Ripple is granted a banking license, they become, with their current XRP holdings, quite possibly one of the top 50, maybe the top 30 well-capitalized banks.” This status would significantly strengthen Ripple’s balance sheet and solidify its position in both conventional finance and crypto markets. The company has already received conditional approval , and many experts believe XRP could benefit significantly once Ripple obtains its license. Impact on XRP and Capitalization The combination of a regulatory framework through the Clarity Act and enhanced capitalization via a banking license would place Ripple in a unique position. It could emerge as a key participant in global finance, leveraging XRP to manage liquidity and capital efficiently. Gilbertie further noted that an increase in XRP’s price would amplify Ripple’s capital base, reinforcing its stability and market influence.

As traditional banks move to limit yields on stablecoins, Ripple and XRP are positioned to fill gaps in global financial infrastructure. The strategic potential of XRP extends beyond trading or investment. With regulatory clarity and institutional integration , XRP could become a central asset for financial operations and cross-border transactions. These elements position Ripple and XRP as foundational pillars of the evolving global economic system. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

At the opening days of the year, the US president ordered a military operation in Venezuela, following which Nicolas Maduro (the leader of the South American country) and his wife were captured and taken to the States. While Trump’s administration charged him with drug trafficking, the huge petrol reserves of Venezuela sparked speculation that the action had other motives, too. Now, POTUS has fixed his gaze on Greenland, the world’s largest island, claiming the US should possess it. The territory belongs to Denmark, a country which happens to be a NATO ally of the USA… The drama has already started to negatively affect some financial and crypto markets, while a potential annexation by America is likely to have an even greater impact. We asked four of the most popular AI-powered chatbots if Bitcoin (BTC) is about to explode or collapse if this becomes reality. Here are the answers. A Massive Decline and Then? According to ChatGPT, such a move would be “a historic geopolitical rupture,” not just a normal headline. It is expected to cause huge panic among investors, and BTC is likely to witness a 10% to 25% dump immediately after the theoretical announcement. The chatbot assumed that the downfall could soon be followed by a resurgence and even a potential boom, similar to what happened after the start of the Russia/Ukraine war. At the same time, ChatGPT warned that BTC’s collapse might be much more substantial if the US annexes Greenland by force, which could spiral into open conflict with NATO members. In that case, the price of the cryptocurrency could nosedive by 40% and even 50% in the first hours after the “global shock” scenario. Grok, the AI chatbot integrated into X, assumed that the United States would most likely drop its plans to acquire the island, as this would have major implications for its European partners. Nonetheless, if annexation were to occur, BTC could plummet by up to 30% in the first weeks, which would align with a possible stock market crash. Google’s Gemini also provided an interesting answer. It claimed that BTC could tumble by 30% after such a groundbreaking announcement, but later it might open the door to a major rally. “An annexation – especially if forced – would be astronomically expensive and diplomatically isolating. If the US government prints more money to fund expansionism or if the “weaponization” of the dollar leads to a loss of its reserve status, Bitcoin’s value as a “stateless” currency would skyrocket. In the aftermath, the Greenland saga could eventually push BTC towrd $1.6 million in a multi-year timeframe.” No Big Drama? Perplexity was the only AI-powered chatbot (among those we consulted) to claim that the hypothetical US annexation of Greenland is unlikely to cause significant volatility in BTC. It assumed that the recent threats and talks on the matter have already played their role, and now it is time for the asset to recover. “When threats stop escalating and worst-case scenarios are taken off the table, risk appetite returns quickly, allowing BTC to rebound,” it concluded.

After a sharp selloff, the token has stabilized and staged a modest recovery, but the broader technical structure remains fragile, with sellers still dominating the medium-term trend. At the time of reporting, XRP was trading at $1.92 , according to CoinCodex data, just below a critical $1.95 resistance zone. Well, this level coincides with a descending trendline that has repeatedly capped recent rallies. Although buyers have defended lower levels and sparked a short-term bounce, momentum remains weak, suggesting bulls lack the strength for a decisive breakout. HolderStat suggests the recent price uptick is a corrective bounce, not yet a true trend reversal. Such rallies often follow sharp declines as short sellers cover and bargain hunters step in, but without strong volume and a decisive break above resistance, they tend to fade and invite renewed selling. The $1.95 level is now the key battleground. A clear breakout and sustained close above this falling trendline would signal a meaningful shift in market structure, potentially restoring bullish control and paving the way for higher price targets. Ripple Now Holds Over 75 Global Regulatory Licenses — A Major Milestone for Crypto Compliance Ripple has surpassed 75 regulatory licenses and approvals worldwide, according to crypto researcher SMQKE, marking one of the most extensive compliance footprints in the crypto industry. Therefore, the milestone highlights Ripple’s deliberate push to integrate with traditional financial systems, reinforcing its credibility and positioning XRP for broader institutional adoption. Ripple now holds regulatory licenses across major financial hubs, including Europe, the UK, Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, and North America. In the UK, it secured both an Electronic Money Institution (EMI) license and crypto asset registration from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), enabling it to provide regulated digital payment and asset services in one of the world’s most established financial markets. Ripple has secured key regulatory approvals in Europe, including preliminary EMI authorization in Luxembourg, enabling it to scale licensed services across the EU under the unified MiCA framework. These approvals are strategically vital, granting passporting rights that allow Ripple to operate throughout all 27 member states without seeking separate national licenses. This regulatory footprint goes beyond compliance, it underpins Ripple’s ambition to make XRP and its payment solutions accessible to banks, payment firms, and institutional investors. By aligning with local financial laws, Ripple reduces legal uncertainty, strengthens trust, and opens the door to institutional adoption, an essential step toward moving crypto from speculative trading to real-world financial infrastructure. Conclusion XRP remains constrained below a critical descending resistance, with current gains largely corrective rather than trend-defining. A decisive breakout above $1.95 is needed for bulls to regain momentum and signal a potential shift toward sustained upward movement. Until then, near-term price action remains uncertain, emphasizing the significance of this key barrier. Meanwhile, Ripple’s attainment of over 75 global regulatory licenses highlights its commitment to compliance, transparency, and integration with traditional finance. This expanding regulatory footprint not only strengthens XRP’s legitimacy but also positions it for broader institutional adoption and cross-border payment innovation.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-24 07:11:12

Crypto startups have successfully raised over $1 billion in capital during the first weeks of the year. This significant fundraising milestone arrives despite recent remarks from former President Donald Trump that injected fresh uncertainty into digital asset markets. Data from blockchain analytics firm DeFiLlama confirms this substantial capital inflow, highlighting a continued, albeit more measured, belief in the long-term infrastructure of the decentralized economy. Crypto Startup Funding Weathers the Political Storm The investment landscape for digital assets often reacts to regulatory and political signals. Consequently, recent comments from prominent political figures created palpable tension. However, venture capital firms and institutional investors appear to be looking beyond short-term headlines. Specifically, they are focusing on foundational technology. In the third week of January alone, 14 separate crypto startups secured a combined $362 million. This weekly surge pushed the cumulative total for 2025 past the $1 billion mark. This activity clearly indicates that sophisticated capital remains committed to the blockchain thesis. Nevertheless, a year-over-year comparison reveals a more nuanced story. The current fundraising volume shows a decline of more than 50% compared to the same period in 2024. This slowdown reflects a broader cooling from the frenetic investment pace of the previous bull market. Investors are now exercising greater selectivity. They are prioritizing startups with clear regulatory pathways, robust business models, and tangible utility over speculative narratives. Breaking Down the Major Investment Deals A closer examination of January’s deals reveals where smart money is flowing. The landscape is no longer dominated by consumer-facing apps and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols alone. Instead, significant capital is targeting the essential plumbing and regulated avenues of the crypto economy. BitGo’s Landmark Raise: The single largest investment went to cryptocurrency custody firm BitGo, which secured $213 million. This capital was raised through an initial public offering (IPO), a traditional finance pathway that signals maturity and a focus on regulatory compliance. Custody services are critical for institutional adoption, as they provide the security required for large-scale asset management. The Tokenization Surge: Another major recipient was Superstate, a firm specializing in blockchain-based investment products. It raised $83 million in a Series B funding round. Significantly, the round was led by Bain Capital Crypto, a heavyweight in the venture world. Superstate’s flagship product is a tokenized fund based on U.S. Treasury bonds, bridging traditional finance (TradFi) with blockchain efficiency. Expert Insight: The Shift to Infrastructure and Real-World Assets Industry analysts point to a strategic pivot in investment focus. “The funding pattern we see in early 2025 is not about chasing the next meme coin or viral app,” notes a veteran fintech analyst at a major investment bank. “It’s a deliberate allocation toward infrastructure—like custody, security, and compliance tools—and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. These are the sectors that build the bridge for trillion-dollar traditional markets to enter the blockchain space. The reduced total volume, compared to 2024, isn’t a sign of weakness but of refinement. The market is maturing.” This analysis is supported by the deal flow. Funding is concentrating on companies that solve real problems: securing digital assets, ensuring regulatory clarity, and creating on-chain representations of established financial instruments like bonds and funds. The following table illustrates the contrast in investment themes between the 2024 bull market and the current 2025 climate: 2024 Bull Market Focus 2025 Selective Market Focus Consumer DeFi & Gamification Institutional Custody & Security Speculative NFT Projects Real-World Asset (RWA) Tokenization Layer 1 Protocol Hype Scalability & Interoperability Solutions Metaverse & Web3 Social Regulatory Technology (RegTech) The Broader Context and Future Implications This sustained funding occurs within a complex global macroeconomic environment. Interest rates remain elevated in many jurisdictions, typically pressuring growth-oriented tech investments. However, the blockchain sector is carving out its own narrative. The promise of tokenization—bringing stocks, bonds, and commodities onto transparent, programmable ledgers—presents a multi-trillion dollar opportunity that is attracting serious capital from traditional finance giants. Furthermore, the political uncertainty cited in reports, while impactful on short-term trader sentiment, seems less relevant to venture capitalists with a 5-10 year horizon. Their investments are bets on technological displacement and new financial architectures, not on quarterly price movements. The continued flow of capital, even at a moderated pace, suggests that these investors see the recent market volatility as a separating event, distinguishing robust projects from weaker ones. Conclusion The data delivers a clear, dual message. First, crypto startup funding remains robust, with over $1 billion deployed in early 2025, proving the sector’s resilience. Second, the investment thesis has evolved, becoming more sophisticated and infrastructure-heavy. While the total volume has cooled from its bull market peak, the quality and strategic direction of the capital have improved significantly. The money is now targeting the foundational layers required for mass adoption: secure custody, compliant tokenization, and regulated bridges to the old financial world. This shift marks not a retreat, but the next, more mature phase of blockchain’s integration into the global economy. FAQs Q1: What was the largest crypto startup funding round in January 2025? A1: The largest round was a $213 million IPO by cryptocurrency custody firm BitGo, highlighting strong investor interest in institutional-grade security infrastructure. Q2: How does 2025 crypto startup funding compare to 2024? A2: While over $1 billion has been raised in early 2025, this represents a decline of more than 50% compared to the same period in 2024, indicating a more selective and mature investment environment. Q3: What is Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization, and why is it getting funded? A3: RWA tokenization involves creating digital tokens on a blockchain that represent ownership of traditional assets like treasury bonds or real estate. It is attracting major funding because it promises to bring massive TradFi liquidity onto blockchain networks, improving efficiency and accessibility. Q4: Did political uncertainty really not affect crypto venture funding? A4: While political remarks can cause short-term market volatility, the data shows venture capital continued to flow. This suggests institutional investors are making long-term bets on blockchain technology’s infrastructure, looking beyond temporary political headlines. Q5: What sectors within crypto are receiving the most venture capital now? A5: Current funding is heavily focused on institutional infrastructure (custody, security), regulatory technology (RegTech), and Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization platforms, moving away from purely consumer-centric or speculative applications.

Key Takeaways: Former Olympian Ryan Wedding was arrested in Mexico and extradited to the US after years on the FBI’s Most Wanted list. Authorities allege he ran a cartel-linked cocaine network and used crypto to launder proceeds. US officials say the operation generated over $1 billion annually and spanned multiple countries. Wedding, 44, was taken into custody in Mexico late Thursday and transferred to the United States on Friday, according to US officials. The former athlete, who competed for Team Canada at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, had been listed among the FBI’s Ten Most Wanted fugitives, with a reward of up to $15 million offered for information leading to his capture. Former Olympic Snowboarder Faces US Charges in Global Drug Case US Attorney General Pam Bondi said Wedding, whom she described as a “onetime Olympian snowboarder-turned alleged violent cocaine kingpin,” will face federal charges in the US related to drug trafficking, murder, and operating a criminal enterprise spanning multiple countries. FBI Director Kash Patel confirmed the arrest in a post on X, crediting cooperation with Mexican authorities for locating Wedding after more than a decade on the run.

Castillo’s quick return… pic.twitter.com/wsrS3eWa2k — FBI Director Kash Patel (@FBIDirectorKash) January 23, 2026 Investigators allege that Wedding played a senior role in cocaine distribution networks tied to Mexico’s Sinaloa Cartel, overseeing shipments from Colombia into the United States and Canada. According to US officials, the operation generated more than $1 billion annually in illegal proceeds at its peak. The US Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctioned Wedding in November, accusing his organization of using cryptocurrency to move and launder drug profits. In its notice, the Treasury said digital assets were used to obscure the flow of funds and conceal large sums derived from narcotics trafficking. Mexico’s Security Secretary Omar García Harfuch said Wedding voluntarily surrendered at the U.S. Embassy before being handed over to the FBI. Patel later told reporters that Wedding had been hiding in Mexico for over 10 years and was believed to be under cartel protection. Wedding arrived Friday at Ontario International Airport in Southern California, where federal officials held a press conference following his transfer. Authorities said they seized firearms, luxury vehicles, artwork, and other assets connected to the alleged criminal enterprise, and indicated further arrests may follow as the investigation continues. Ryan Wedding’s Earlier Cocaine Case Predates Latest US Charges This is not Wedding’s first encounter with US law enforcement. In 2008, he was arrested in California in a cocaine trafficking sting involving a Vancouver-based operation. He was convicted in 2009 and sentenced to four years in prison, before being released around 2011. The arrest comes as crypto-related crime remains a growing concern. According to Chainalysis, illicit cryptocurrency addresses received a record $154 billion in 2025 , a sharp increase from the year before. In another case, US prosecutors have charged a 23-year-old Brooklyn resident , Ronald Spektor, with stealing roughly $16 million in cryptocurrency from around 100 Coinbase users through an alleged phishing and social engineering scheme.

Aside from its backing from the Trump family, the USD1’s rapid growth has also come due to strategic partnerships with major exchanges like Binance. World Liberty’s USD1 stablecoin has outpaced PayPal’s PYUSD. Source: CoinMarketCap . How did USD1 outpace PYUSD? Eric Trump formally announced on the social media platform X that the stablecoin for World Liberty Financial (WLFi), known as USD1, is now larger than PayPal’s digital dollar (PYUSD). Recent market data shows that USD1 holds a market capitalization of almost $4.5 billion, passing PayPal’s PYUSD, which sits at $3.76 billion. PayPal is a global fintech giant with millions of users, while USD1 was launched less than a year ago. The USD1 stablecoin actually jumped out of the gate when it was used to complete a $2 billion MGX investment into Binance. Since then, the project has made aggressive expansion moves, such as its partnership with Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. In late 2025, Binance launched a “booster program” for USD1. This program offered investors annual returns of up to 20% for holding the token in flexible savings accounts. The GENIUS Act, which was signed into law by President Trump in July 2025, prohibits stablecoin issuers from paying interest directly to holders; therefore, exchange-based “earn” programs have become the primary way for users to get rewards. This incentive led to a massive influx of capital, and USD1’s market cap jumped by hundreds of millions of dollars in just a few months. World Liberty Financial has focused on “Real-World Asset” (RWA) tokenization. In early January 2026, the project began tokenizing commodities like oil, gas, and timber, using USD1 as the primary currency for these settlements. Trump family crypto ventures According to recent reports, the Trump family’s crypto ventures have generated over $1 billion in proceeds since the start of 2025. Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. have led the expansion, which now includes the WLFI governance token that is currently valued at a market cap of $4.7 billion and a new Bitcoin mining operation called American Bitcoin. American Bitcoin saw its stock price jump 14% earlier this month, and the company recently disclosed a treasury of over 5,000 BTC. World Liberty Financial applied for a U.S. national trust bank charter on January 8, 2026. If the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) approves the application, the family will be allowed to operate a regulated bank that can issue and safeguard USD1 under federal oversight. Also in January, WLFI announced a strategic partnership with Spacecoin, a project that uses a network of satellites to provide decentralized internet and banking to remote areas. All of these developments are leading up to the World Liberty Forum , which will be held at Mar-a-Lago on February 18, 2026.

This precise balance in trader positioning offers a compelling snapshot of a market in a state of tentative neutrality, where neither bullish nor bearish forces currently hold decisive sway. The data, sourced directly from exchange-provided metrics, provides institutional and retail traders alike with a critical, real-time gauge of collective market sentiment and potential directional bias. Decoding the BTC Perpetual Futures Long/Short Ratio The long/short ratio represents a fundamental metric in derivatives trading. It measures the percentage of open positions betting on a price increase (long) versus those betting on a decline (short). Analysts scrutinize this data because significant imbalances can signal overcrowded trades and potential market reversals. Conversely, a balanced ratio, as observed currently, often indicates a period of consolidation or indecision. Perpetual futures, unlike traditional dated contracts, have no expiry, making them a preferred instrument for continuous speculation and hedging. Their popularity means their collective positioning offers a high-fidelity read on trader psychology. Monitoring this ratio across different venues is crucial. Each exchange possesses a unique user demographic. For instance, Binance’s vast global user base often reflects broader retail sentiment, while Bybit and OKX cater to significant professional and algorithmic trading communities. Therefore, a consistent pattern across all three platforms carries substantial weight, suggesting the neutral sentiment is widespread and not isolated to a single trader cohort. A Detailed Breakdown of Exchange-Specific Data The 24-hour snapshot ending March 21, 2025, reveals an almost uncanny symmetry in positioning. The aggregate data across Binance, Bybit, and OKX showed 49.74% of accounts held long positions, while 50.26% were short. This represents a net difference of merely 0.52 percentage points, a statistically negligible margin that underscores the market’s equilibrium. A closer examination of each exchange’s data provides further nuance and confirms the overarching trend. Exchange Long Positions Short Positions Net Bias Binance 50.07% 49.93% +0.14% (Slightly Long) Bybit 50.14% 49.86% +0.28% (Slightly Long) OKX 50.36% 49.64% +0.72% (Slightly Long) Overall Aggregate 49.74% 50.26% -0.52% (Slightly Short) Notably, all three individual exchanges reported a marginal long bias. However, the aggregate figure tips slightly short. This minor discrepancy can be attributed to variations in the total open interest weighting of each exchange. It highlights the importance of analyzing both consolidated and venue-specific data. The key takeaway remains the absence of any extreme skew. For context, ratios exceeding 55% long or short are typically viewed as significant, often preceding violent ‘long squeeze’ or ‘short squeeze’ events where one side is forced to rapidly unwind positions. Historical Context and Market Impact Such a balanced BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio is historically significant. Markets frequently oscillate between periods of extreme greed and fear, especially following major volatility events like ETF approvals, regulatory announcements, or macroeconomic shifts. The current data suggests a potential cooling-off period. Traders may be digesting recent price action, awaiting clearer macroeconomic signals, or reassessing their strategies ahead of the next Bitcoin halving cycle. This equilibrium reduces the immediate risk of a violent, liquidity-driven move stemming from derivatives markets alone. Furthermore, this data interacts with other critical on-chain and off-chain metrics. For example, analysts often cross-reference the futures funding rate—a periodic payment between longs and shorts that maintains the perpetual contract’s price peg. A neutral long/short ratio alongside a neutral or slightly positive funding rate reinforces the picture of a stable, non-speculative derivatives environment. This stability can provide a healthier foundation for spot market price discovery, as extreme leverage is not currently distorting the market. Interpreting Neutral Sentiment for Future Price Action A balanced market is a double-edged sword for analysts. On one hand, it indicates a lack of strong conviction, which can lead to range-bound price action. On the other hand, it represents a coiled spring; a fundamental catalyst or major news event can trigger a powerful move as one side of the market quickly gains dominance. The current environment places greater emphasis on external catalysts, such as: Macroeconomic Data: U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate decisions and inflation reports. Regulatory Developments: Clarity from global regulators on digital asset frameworks. On-Chain Activity: Movements by large Bitcoin holders (whales) or changes in exchange reserves. Spot Market Flows: Net inflows or outflows from major spot Bitcoin ETFs. In essence, the derivatives market has reset to a neutral state, effectively passing the baton to spot market dynamics and real-world events to determine the next major trend. This is often considered a healthier market structure than one driven predominantly by leveraged speculation, which can exacerbate volatility and lead to unsustainable price moves. Conclusion The latest BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio presents a fascinating case study in market psychology. The near-perfect 50/50 split across Binance, Bybit, and OKX underscores a period of remarkable balance and collective indecision among traders. This equilibrium suggests the market is in a consolidation phase, digesting previous information and awaiting new catalysts. For investors, this neutral derivatives backdrop may signal reduced near-term volatility risk from leverage unwinds, focusing attention instead on fundamental and macroeconomic drivers. Monitoring shifts away from this delicate balance will be crucial for anticipating the market’s next significant move, making the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio an indispensable tool for informed market participation. FAQs Q1: What does a 50/50 BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio mean? A1: A 50/50 ratio indicates a perfect balance between traders betting on price increases (longs) and those betting on decreases (shorts). It generally reflects neutral market sentiment, a lack of strong directional bias, and can precede periods of consolidation or a significant breakout following a new catalyst. Q2: Why is the ratio different on Binance, Bybit, and OKX? A2: Each exchange has a different user base comprising retail traders, professional firms, and algorithmic systems. Slight variations in the ratio are normal and reflect the unique sentiment and trading strategies prevalent on each platform. The overall trend, however, is what analysts find most significant. Q3: Is a balanced long/short ratio bullish or bearish? A3: It is inherently neutral. It is neither bullish nor bearish but signifies equilibrium. It suggests the market is not over-leveraged in one direction, which reduces the immediate risk of a violent squeeze. The next price trend will likely be determined by external fundamental factors rather than derivatives positioning alone. Q4: How often does this ratio update? A4: The data typically updates in real-time or at very short intervals (e.g., every few minutes) on exchange websites and data aggregators. The 24-hour snapshot provides a smoothed, broader view of sentiment, reducing the noise from intraday fluctuations. Q5: How should a trader use this information? A5: Traders use this ratio as a contrarian indicator at extremes and a confirmation tool at neutral levels. When the ratio becomes extremely skewed (e.g., 70% long), it can signal a crowded trade and a potential reversal. At current neutral levels, it advises traders to look to other indicators—like spot price action, volume, and on-chain data—for clearer directional signals.

In this article, we will review those, especially the latest one, and examine the disappointing price performance of the underlying asset. Latest Pi Network Updates Shortly after 2026 began, the Pi Network team introduced its first update for the year, which allowed developers to integrate PI app payments into their applications in under ten minutes, as promised. This became possible after implementing a new developer library, reducing the payment integration process to a much shorter timeframe. Such a simplification allows users to spend more time creating and improving their products, aligning with the project’s longer-term strategy to strengthen and expand the ecosystem’s utility. The second update, announced earlier this week, builds on the first as it introduced an easy PI payment integration directly within the Pi App Studio, which allows creators to add in-app settlements to their applications without writing any code or having technical expertise. The team clarified that the payments are still limited to Test-Pi, but promised that this beta version lays the groundwork for future Mainnet-enabled monetization. Once this update is deployed to the Mainnet, creators will be able to add payment interactions that apply to a single active session, including unlocking features or purchasing in-app items. Pi Network’s team also launched a creator-focused event within the Pi App Studio, which will allow 1,000 qualified participants to receive 5 PI token credits, usable exclusively within the platform for app creation and customization. Separately, the Core Team announced on X that it had deployed a 2025 review button in the app, allowing users to review their 2025 mining summary.

As the geopolitical tension between allies worsened, PI joined the rest of the crypto market and dumped by double digits to under $0.18, which was inches away from the ATL of $0.172 marked in October. Despite some positive news in terms of token withdrawals from exchanges, the asset has failed to stage a meaningful recovery and now trades at $0.183, which shows a 1% daily decline and a whopping 11% weekly drop. Given its substantial downfall on a macro basis, some analysts offered their view on what the team should change to improve PI’s performance.

The 7-Year Comeback You Can’t Ignore,https://coinpaper.com/13994/could-xrp-eclipse-gold-the-7-year-comeback-you-can-t-ignore,"Is XRP Poised to Outperform Gold? Analysts Say the Shift Could Be Massive Renowned analyst X Finance Bull has ignited renewed crypto excitement, signaling that XRP could be poised for a historic surge against traditional assets like gold. After seven years of decline and market doubt, the GOLD/XRP chart is now showing patterns that suggest a potential major turnaround. X Finance Bull notes that XRP has traversed the full market cycle, from distribution, where early holders exit, to capitulation, defined by panic selling, and accumulation, where astute investors quietly buy at discounts. Charts now hint at early expansion, suggesting XRP may be entering a fresh growth phase. Supporting this, XRP’s open interest has recently surpassed its 30-day average, signaling renewed market engagement. Well, this potential shift highlights a growing trend in crypto markets known as rotation flows. While gold has long been seen as a safe store-of-value and hedge against uncertainty, XRP offers value through utility, powering cross-border payments, liquidity solutions, and financial infrastructure. As investors seek assets that combine practical use with liquidity, capital could increasingly move from traditional stores-of-value like gold into XRP, positioning it as a key beneficiary. Therefore, X Finance Bull predicts XRP could surge 10x before mainstream recognition, warning that many investors will remain skeptical until the rally is in motion. This shift in value perception, from traditional assets to digital alternatives, could redefine investment strategies for both retail and institutional players. Notably, XRP’s bold advance comes despite gold’s strong performance, which has surged over 70% since last year. Why does this matter? Well, positioning ahead of market rotations is crucial. As X Finance Bull highlights, the current chart setup signals more than technical shifts, it reflects a redefinition of value in the digital era. If the projected GOLD/XRP flippening occurs, early adopters could witness a transformative surge, elevating XRP from a cryptocurrency to a credible alternative to traditional stores of value like gold. Conclusion XRP’s potential to outpace gold signals more than speculation, it highlights a shift in how value is recognized. After a prolonged decline, early gains suggest XRP may be entering a phase of accelerated growth. Therefore, understanding the rotation from traditional stores-of-value to utility-driven assets is crucial. Whether XRP delivers a 10x surge or redefines market perceptions, the message is clear: static assets are giving way to dynamic, utility-based alternatives, and early action could pay off.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-24 07:45:40

Moreover, he noted that he doesn’t care about the assets’ price moves and explained why. Price Moves Don’t Bother Kiyosaki On a self-asked question whether the investor and author cares when BTC, gold, and silver go up and down, he explicitly said “No, I don’t care.” This is because there are larger issues at hand, such as the quickly growing national debt of the US. Additionally, the purchasing power of the world’s reserve currency, the US dollar, continues to decline, he added. Bloomberg reported yesterday that the greenback registered its worst trading week against other fiat currencies since June last year. Kiyosaki also asked why investors should be focused on the price of the four aforementioned assets when the “world has incompetent, highly educated PhDs controlling the Fed, the Treasury, and [the] US Government.” Instead, his investment strategy is to just “keep buying more gold, silver, Bitcoin, and Ethereum and get richer.” Interestingly, his statement now comes just a couple of months after he said he had disposed of his BTC stash (worth over $2 million at the time) to purchase two surgery centers and invest in a billboard business. Nevertheless, he added that he will continue buying BTC with the proceeds of those cash-flow businesses. Silver Dominates The author of the Rich Dad, Poor Dad best-seller has been a long-time proponent of silver as well, even in times when it seemed the metal was stuck without any big moves. In the past several months, though, it has become a top gainer, surging by triple digits to another all-time high of over $100 as of January 23. In a new post on X, Kiyosaki explained why he believes silver is “superior,” and predicted that its rally will not stop soon. Moreover, he noted that a price tag of $200 per ounce in 2026 is a realistic target. WHY SILVER is SUPERIOR Gold and silver have been money for thousands of years.

Related Reading: Dogecoin Foundation-Backed ETF Launches On Nasdaq As Analysts Call For Massive DOGE Rally XRP Enters Inflection Point After retesting the $1.90 area on Friday morning, XRP saw a 4.6% intraday bounce toward the mid-zone of its local range. Over the past five days, the cryptocurrency has been hovering in the $1.85-$2.00 price range, failing to hold the upper zone of this range. Market watcher ChartNerd pointed out a key reversal pattern that could signal a massive price expansion may be around the corner, noting that the altcoin is at a “critical inflection point” as it retests a macro support zone. He explained that a running flat ABC correction formation is “a sophisticated structure where the failure of the ‘C’ wave to breach previous lows signals underlying bullish strength.” XRP has been mirroring the same structure over the past 400 days, which would point “toward a structural breakout, marking the transition from a yearly long base into a new primary uptrend” if it resolves. As the chart shows, “the wave counts repeating toward the structure are evident in XRP’s price action,” and as long as the macro support holds, around the $1.80 area, the C wave “could be working in the bulls’ defense.” We could be just building a base above $1.80, marking the C wave in this running flat correction before the major breakout. ChartNerd added that there could be a scenario in which XRP deviates below its major support before a V-shape recovery. However, he warned that losing this area would not be healthy, detailing that the only way to invalidate the pattern would be for the price to close below the structure’s support, retest it as resistance, and drop to lower levels. XRP’s Price Defends Macro Support The analyst emphasized the importance of the $1.80 level, noting that XRP has been defending this territory for over a year and could lead to a new all-time high (ATH) rally. “This is a macro accumulation zone, and we evidently also have two major levels of descending resistance for XRP,” he detailed, highlighting that when the first multi-month descending resistance broke, the altcoin rallied to a new all-time high. It’s pretty simple: we have descending resistance on our heads at the moment, and we once had a point of contact on this resistance at the $2.40 high (…) So, at this moment in time, the simplicity tells us: break the descending resistance, and this is where XRP really starts gearing up for further expansion. Based on this, ChartNerd asserted that if the altcoin defends the $1.80 macro support, then a similar rally is likely. Similarly, he pointed to a bullish reversal structure building below the key $2.70 resistance on XRP’s chart. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $80,000?

Now, the price is retesting the pattern’s breakout level as support and could be preparing to climb toward the level it started forming. “So XRP just needs to defend the guard at $1.80, and this is where we could be looking for that sort of major expansion and looking to press back up to the target of $2.70,” before potentially challenging its pre-Q4 range, he concluded.

57431284,658858,1769241621,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57431284.jpeg,Bitcoin Difficulty Drops 3.3% As Miners Pull Back Hashrate,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-difficulty-drops-3-3-miners-back-hashrate/,"On-chain data shows the Bitcoin mining Difficulty has seen a downward adjustment following the decline in the network Hashrate. Bitcoin Blockchain Has Eased Mining Difficulty According to data from CoinWarz , the Bitcoin mining Difficulty has gone through a decline in the latest network adjustment. The “ Difficulty ” here refers to a metric built into the blockchain that controls how hard miners would find it to discover a block . The indicator’s value automatically changes roughly every two weeks in events called adjustments, based on how miners performed since the last such event. The blockchain follows one simple rule to adjust the Difficulty: miner blockchain production rate should converge to 10 minutes per block. If miners find the average block in an interval greater than 10 minutes, then the network responds by raising its Difficulty just enough that these validators are slowed back down to the standard rate. On the other hand, this cohort performing slower than needed forces the blockchain to ease things up. The latest Bitcoin Difficulty adjustment occurred on Thursday, and as the below chart shows, it resulted in a decrease for the metric. Prior to the change, the indicator had a value of 146.47 trillion hashes. Now, it has dropped to 141.67 trillion hashes, indicating a decrease of 3.28%. This is the second-consecutive reduction in the network Difficulty. In fact, the indicator has been in a long-term decline since November, with five of the six Difficulty changes that have occurred in the period leading to a drop in its value. Even the one adjustment that didn’t lead to a decrease in the metric had an almost neutral effect, so while the decline didn’t strengthen during it, it didn’t correspond to a change of direction either. The reason for this long drawdown in the Bitcoin Difficulty lies in the trend witnessed by the Hashrate , a measure of the total amount of computing power connected by the miners to the network. As data from Blockchain.com shows, the 7-day average value of the Hashrate has been going down during the last few months. On January 18th, the 7-day average Bitcoin Hashrate fell to 978.8 exahashes per second (EH/s), its lowest level since the first half of September. The indicator has observed a rebound since this low, but its value still remains notably lower than earlier in the month. Miners’ pace tends to directly correlate with the amount of computing power that they possess, so a decline in the Hashrate usually results in a correction for the Difficulty. The continued downtrend in the former since October is why the latter has also plunged. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $90,000, down more than 5% over the last week.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin difficulty|bitcoin hashrate|Bitcoin Miners|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MINING|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-24 08:00:21

According to crypto analyst XRP Captain (@UniverseTwenty), this target represents a 4.90x increase from its current levels. The analyst highlighted the long-term holders of XRP since 2017, implying strong community support and conviction behind the token. #XRP price with market cap of #ETH ath market cap 9.60$ per #XRP and it's going to happen we all know who is holding #XRP since 2017 pic.twitter.com/fajijJab79 — XRP CAPTAIN (@UniverseTwenty) January 22, 2026 XRP’s Current Position At present, XRP sits significantly below Ethereum’s market cap, at 0.20x of ETH. Its market capitalization stands at approximately $119 billion, while Ethereum has $583 billion. This gap indicates substantial room for growth if XRP continues to attract institutional and retail adoption. XRP Captain emphasized the importance of long-term holding patterns in positioning the token for this growth. The cryptocurrency has remained within a consolidation range for the past 13 months . During this period, market activity has been steady, with XRP establishing a foundation that could support higher valuations. Consolidation phases like this often precede decisive price movements, particularly for assets with increasing adoption. Factors Supporting XRP’s Growth Several elements contribute to XRP’s bullish outlook. Ripple has been expanding its global partnerships. These collaborations include financial institutions and payment networks that enhance XRP’s utility. By securing new licenses and regulatory approvals, Ripple continues to integrate XRP into traditional financial systems, increasing its relevance as a transactional and settlement asset. Growing adoption also strengthens XRP’s potential. Digital payments and cross-border transfers are increasingly favoring efficient and low-cost solutions. XRP’s technology offers both speed and scalability, positioning it as a competitive option. XRP Captain noted that those holding XRP since 2017 are well aware of its long-term potential , suggesting confidence in its ability to reach higher valuations. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Legislative clarity is another factor supporting XRP’s trajectory. Regulatory recognition provides legitimacy, which can attract new investors and institutions. XRP’s compliance efforts with regulators further enhance its credibility, reinforcing the token’s ability to compete with major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. Potential Market Impact If XRP reaches Ethereum’s market cap, its price would rise to $9.60. This scenario reflects strong growth potential and positions XRP as a major player in the cryptocurrency market. The combination of long-term holder confidence, regulatory progress, and expanding partnerships creates an environment conducive to significant price gains. Analysts see XRP’s technology and strategic positioning as key drivers that could elevate it above Ethereum. This would make it the second-largest cryptocurrency, achieving a feat many have predicted for years . Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Buterin stresses that it is the work of the Ethereum developers and cypherpunk community to ensure user independence without being hostile to institutions. According to Buterin, the relationship between cypherpunks and large corporations or governments is far from simple. He points out that governments and corporations are not always enemies of privacy tools and open systems, nor are they guaranteed allies. They usually support open systems in one area while pushing for control in another. Buterin points to several recent examples, noting that the EU has signaled strong support for open-source software. At the same time, some EU officials push for Chat Control, requiring encrypted messaging to have backdoors. He also cited the U.S. Patriot Act, which he says remains in effect with little interest in repealing it from either Democrats or Republicans. Buterin says institutions play both sides in the cypherpunk debate According to the Ethereum co-founder, institutions play both sides of the cypherpunk debate, and this pattern reflects a basic mindset: control everything possible and resist control by others. However, he concludes that cypherpunks need not be hostile to institutions, though they should firmly defend their core interests. For Ethereum users, Buterin believes that the core interest is building social, financial, and identity systems that protect user freedom and self-sovereignty. He calls Ethereum a censorship-resistant world computer, where no one has to approve of every activity running on it. In his view, building strong systems on top of Ethereum to compete both against CEXs and within blockchain ecosystems is what matters. “At best, we can interoperate with the non-cypherpunk world to better bootstrap the cypherpunk world…Synergies like this should be explored across all domains.” – Vitalik Buterin , Co-founder of Ethereum According to Buterin, institutions will favor self-custody and staking going forward, supporting Ethereum’s decentralization. He also noted that KYC and privacy technologies evolve in parallel with ongoing debates around zero-knowledge proofs. The Ethereum co-founder further stated that institutions are currently focusing on data security and sovereignty to maximize control and minimize reliance on external parties. Stablecoins to sit at the center of the control war Buterin says stablecoins will be one of the main battlefields between crypto privacy supporters and institutions. He emphasizes that governments and large corporations want digital currencies they can rely on, but also want strong control over risk, compliance, and rules. Meanwhile, stablecoin issuers in the EU will prefer blockchains not dominated by U.S. governance, while U.S.-based issuers will prefer the opposite, according to Buterin. The political balance is expected to influence which chains institutions choose. At the same time, the Ethereum co-founder expects governments to push harder for KYC and monitoring of stablecoin use. Buterin also projects that privacy around stablecoins will continue to improve, adding that user privacy protection tools will grow stronger and that non-KYC stablecoins are not likely to disappear. He points to ideas like zero-knowledge proofs of money sources, which could allow users to prove compliance without revealing everything. However, Buterin warns that these tools will trigger deep disagreements inside the crypto space. According to Buterin, spreads on decentralized stablecoins can also decrease if it is easy for people to run arbitrage strategies where they hold positive quantities of a centralized stablecoin and negative quantities of the decentralized one. He also believes that traditional financial institutions should explore improving the liquidity of their stablecoins to use them for hedging existing risks. On the other hand, the Ethereum executive notes that institutions want to retain full control over their own stablecoin wallets and infrastructure. He also explains that it is up to cypherpunks and Ethereum developers to ensure that regular users continue to have access to self-sovereign, secure ways to hold and use stablecoins.

This decisive action, captured by blockchain analysts, provides a critical real-time case study into high-stakes crypto portfolio management and prevailing market pressures as we move through 2025. Ethereum Whale Transaction Details and Immediate Impact According to prominent on-chain analyst ai_9684xtpa, the whale address executed a substantial transfer early today. The entity deposited 1,999 ETH, valued at approximately $5.92 million, to a major cryptocurrency exchange. Consequently, this move signals a potential readiness to sell. The transaction history reveals this whale originally acquired 6,411 ETH last year at an average price of $3,873 per token. Therefore, selling the deposited coins at current market prices would result in an estimated loss of $1.815 million. The address retains a significant holding of 3,803 ETH, worth over $11 million, indicating a partial repositioning rather than a full exit. Analyzing the Whale’s Cost Basis and Market Context This transaction did not occur in a vacuum. The broader cryptocurrency market, particularly Ethereum, has experienced notable volatility over the past twelve months. The whale’s entry price of $3,873 sits considerably above recent trading ranges, illustrating the challenging environment for large-scale investors who entered during previous market cycles. Market data shows Ethereum has struggled to reclaim its previous all-time highs, facing consistent resistance levels. This context makes the decision to deposit funds, despite the paper loss, particularly noteworthy for market observers. The Strategic Implications of Large Exchange Deposits Moving assets from a private wallet to a centralized exchange is a precursor action with several potential interpretations. Analysts typically view such deposits as preparatory steps for selling, collateralizing loans, or participating in exchange-specific yield products. For instance, a deposit of this magnitude can immediately increase selling pressure on the order books. Alternatively, the whale might seek liquidity for other investments or to cover obligations without selling the entire portfolio. The retained 3,803 ETH suggests a strategic recalibration rather than a loss of confidence in Ethereum’s long-term thesis. Liquidity Access: Exchanges provide immediate fiat or stablecoin conversion. Risk Management: Cutting losses on a portion of a position can hedge further downside. Portfolio Rebalancing: The move may fund new allocations in other digital assets or sectors. On-Chain Analysis as a Market Health Indicator The work of analysts like ai_9684xtpa provides transparency into the actions of large holders, offering valuable signals for the wider market. Tracking whale wallets has become a fundamental aspect of crypto market analysis. Significant deposits to exchanges often correlate with increased volatility or impending price movements. Furthermore, monitoring unrealized losses across major wallets helps gauge overall market stress and potential sell-side pressure. This specific case highlights the tangible financial consequences of timing and entry points in a volatile asset class. Comparative Whale Behavior in Current Market Conditions Recent months have shown varied behavior among Ethereum’s largest holders. Some whales have continued accumulating on price dips, demonstrating a dollar-cost averaging strategy. Others, like the subject of this report, appear to be managing losses. The table below contrasts common whale strategies observed in Q1 2025: Strategy Typical On-Chain Signal Market Interpretation Accumulation Transfers from exchanges to cold wallets Bullish long-term conviction Distribution Large deposits to exchanges (as seen here) Potential selling pressure or need for liquidity Hodling No movement from long-term wallets Neutral, waiting for price targets Staking/DeFi Transfers to staking contracts or DeFi protocols Seeking yield while remaining exposed Conclusion The Ethereum whale’s deposit of $5.92 million, facing a potential $1.8 million loss, serves as a powerful reminder of the risks inherent in cryptocurrency markets. This event underscores the importance of entry strategy, portfolio management, and the critical role of on-chain analytics. While the move indicates a significant financial decision for one entity, the whale’s remaining $11 million ETH holding suggests a nuanced approach to risk. For the broader market, such transactions provide essential, real-time data on investor sentiment and potential price pressure, making transparent blockchain analysis an indispensable tool for understanding digital asset dynamics in 2025. FAQs Q1: What is a cryptocurrency ‘whale’? A cryptocurrency whale is an individual or entity that holds a large enough amount of a specific digital asset that their trades can potentially influence market prices. Q2: Why would a whale sell at a loss? Whales may sell at a loss for several reasons, including risk management to prevent further losses, needing liquidity for other obligations, tax-loss harvesting strategies, or rebalancing their portfolio into other assets. Q3: How do analysts track whale transactions? Analysts use blockchain explorers and specialized software to monitor large wallets identified through on-chain activity. They track movements to and from exchanges, DeFi protocols, and between wallets. Q4: Does a large exchange deposit always mean an immediate sale? Not always. While it is a strong indicator, deposits can also precede using funds as collateral for loans, transferring between exchange accounts, or participating in exchange-only offerings like launchpads or earn products. Q5: What impact does this have on the average Ethereum investor? A single whale deposit can increase immediate selling pressure, potentially lowering the price. However, it also provides market transparency. For long-term investors, it emphasizes the importance of sound entry points and diversification, rather than reacting to single transactions.

The new legislation is not limited to businesses, as residents are also covered under the new bill that was submitted this week. The bill, Senate Bill 2064, was introduced by Senator Dusty Deevers during the 2026 legislative session. It establishes a legal framework for the use of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange and compensation without officially recognizing the asset as a legal tender. The bill mentions that it does not conflict with the United States Constitution’s prohibition on states declaring legal tender other than gold and silver. Instead, it will recognize Bitcoin as a financial instrument being used within the legal frameworks of the country. Oklahoma releases new bill focused on BTC payments According to Senate Bill 2064 , it would provide state employees in Oklahoma with the option to receive their salaries or wages in Bitcoin. The payment is expected to be based on the asset’s market value at the start of a pay period or at the time of payment. Employees would also be allowed to choose their payment preference at the beginning of every pay period, where they could choose to take their pay in Bitcoin, US dollars, or a combination of both. Payments are also expected to be deposited in a self-hosted wallet under the control of the employee or a third-party custodial account of the employee’s choice. The legislation will also provide vendors in contract with the state an option to take their payment in Bitcoin on a per-transaction basis. The value of the Bitcoin payment would be determined by the price of the asset at the time of the transaction, unless otherwise stated in a written agreement. Aside from payroll and procurement, the bill also allows private businesses and residents in Oklahoma to negotiate and receive payments in Bitcoin. This means that the bill enforces the use of the asset as a voluntary medium of exchange across the state. According to reports, SB 2064 includes several provisions, including ones aimed at limiting regulatory friction for Bitcoin native businesses. Firms dealing exclusively in crypto and do not exchange them would be exempted from Oklahoma’s money transmitter licensing requirements. The new bill could take effect in November 2026 The bill also directs the Oklahoma State Treasurer to issue a request for proposals for a crypto firm that would be used to process Bitcoin payments for state employees and vendors. While selecting a provider, the Treasurer is expected to consider several factors, including fees, transaction speed, relevant state licenses, custody options, and cybersecurity practices. The Treasurer is expected to finalize all contracts with a provider by January 1, 2027. In addition, the Treasurer is also expected to promote the rules for implementing the program. The current bill follows a previous one introduced by Oklahoma State Senator Dusty Deevers in January 2025. It was called the Bitcoin Freedom Act (SB 325) and was designed to allow employees, vendors, and businesses choose if they want to receive and make payments in Bitcoin while creating a legal framework for the use of the asset in the state’s economy. The move follows States like New Hampshire and Texas in looking into several ways to integrate Bitcoin into public finance. New Hampshire passed the country’s first Strategic Bitcoin Reserve law, allowing the state to hold about 5% of its funds in high-cap digital assets. In addition, it also approved a Bitcoin-backed municipal bond. On the other hand, Texas created its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and made the first US state Bitcoin ETF purchase of around $5 million. If passed, the new legislation would take effect in Oklahoma in November 2026, adding the state to a small list of US states looking into the direct integration of Bitcoin into government payment systems. The Oklahoma Tax Commission would also be tasked with issuing guidance on the tax treatment of digital assets received as payment starting from January 2027, addressing an area that has often created uncertainty for employees and employers.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) The new cryptocurrency that has been in the spotlight is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . It is developing a decentralized lending protocol that is based on two markets. The former is a P2C market employing a liquidity pool. Lenders provide assets and are given mtTokens displaying their position and APY. Under the circumstances that the demand to borrow more money goes high, the APY may climb up to mid-single digits. Borrowing is done by borrowers through the liquidity pool by pledging collateral under certain loan-to-value ratios like 50 or 65%. The second market is P2P. Borrowers are matched with lenders in an equal fashion with regards to collateral and liquidation. Liquidity is unlocked to a borrower without the need to sell any assets and in event of the fall of market prices too far, liquidation bots safeguard lenders. The same structure is manifested in distribution. In early 2025, Mutuum Finance started its presale at the price of$ 0.01. MUTM is currently at $0.04 in the presale Phase 7, which is a 300 percent increase of the first stage. It has raised a total of 19.9M and 18,900 holders have been onboarded and 830M tokens sold. V1 Launch and First Pricing Model V1 is the strongest milestone in the future. Based on the official X statement of the team, the V1 protocol will be released in the Sepolia testnet in Q1 2026. V1 features collateral regulations, liquidation frameworks, debt accounting and ETH and USDT backing. Analysts define V1 as the shift at which Mutuum Finance will transition into utility since borrowing and lending will start generating data and revenue. Security validation has been done as well. Mutuum Finance successfully completed an independent audit with Halborn Security and has a 90 out of 100 score on token scan by CertiK. According to these future milestones, certain analysts opine that a repricing by MUTM to the $0.10 to $0.14 routes is likely to happen once V1 is operational and mainnet follows. This would translate into a 150%-250% appreciation of the current position of 0.04 on the basis of utility activation instead of sentiment. Second Pricing Model MtTokens are another product used by Mutuum Finance in its fee model. In the process of making borrowers pay interest, some of the funds are paid to lenders via mtTokens. The other portion will be bought in the open market as MUTM. The bought tokens are in turn re-assigned to mtToken stakers in the safety module. Analysts point out this type of buy-and-distribute model since it links token demand to the amount borrowed rather than attention hours. In case of expansion in borrowing, the revenue grows, and the pressure to buy rises. The accuracy of pricing of collateral and liquidation logic will be supported by oracles. Price feeds should be accurately priced in high volatility since the distortion of price feeds can instigate unnecessary liquidation. According to analysts, oracle reliability is among the most crucial layers by lending systems that are planning to scale. In this type of revenue-based valuation, the analysts following crypto forecasts calculate that MUTM may go to $0.18-$24 in 2027 as the volume of borrowing increases. It is about a 350% to 500% upsurge on the current price under the sustained use and moderate demand by lenders. Looking Forward Some analysts have likened Mutuum Finance to early Aave structurally. The analogy is not one of architecture. It is about sequencing. Aave came to the limelight at the point at which borrowing information started developing, when fee structures were apparent, and when collateral reasoning proved to be robust. The same happens in the case of Mutuum Finance as V1 is going to release its testnet and security verification is finalized. The larger idea of Mutuum Finance consists of creating a lending protocol that processes collateral, demand of borrowing, stability and revenue of usage instead of social stories. It is why some analysts say it is among the best crypto assets to have long-term exposure and why others consider it another crypto candidate that could 10x on utility adoption within the 2026 2027 window.

Key Takeaways: The SEC dropped its case after Gemini Earn investors were fully repaid in crypto. Repayments came through the Genesis bankruptcy process in mid-2024. The decision hinged on a 100% in-kind return of customer assets. In a joint filing submitted Friday to federal court in Manhattan, the SEC and Gemini Space Station cited the complete repayment of assets to users of the Gemini Earn program through the Genesis Global Capital bankruptcy process. The repayments were completed between May and June 2024, according to the court document. SEC Drops Gemini Case After Earn Investors Made Whole The regulator said the decision followed the “100 percent in-kind return” of crypto assets to affected investors, meaning customers received the same digital assets they had originally deposited rather than cash equivalents. Based on that outcome, the SEC concluded that dismissing its claims against Gemini was appropriate. The case stems from charges brought in January 2023, when the SEC accused Gemini Trust Company and Genesis Global Capital of offering unregistered securities through the Gemini Earn program. Under the arrangement, Gemini users loaned their crypto to Genesis in exchange for yield, with Gemini acting as the platform intermediary. The SEC has dismissed its lawsuit against the Winklevoss twins–backed Gemini over its earn product pic.twitter.com/aq35vpGxG7 — 0xMarioNawfal (@RoundtableSpace) January 23, 2026 At its peak, the Gemini Earn program held approximately $940 million in customer assets. That balance was frozen in November 2022 when Genesis halted withdrawals amid broader market turmoil following the collapse of several major crypto firms. Genesis later filed for bankruptcy, triggering months of negotiations among creditors, regulators, and counterparties. Unlike many firms that failed during the 2022 crypto downturn, Genesis ultimately returned customer assets rather than liquidating holdings and distributing cash proceeds. That outcome played a central role in the SEC’s decision to unwind its case against Gemini. SEC Drops Gemini Case as Crypto Policy Softens and Exchange Grows The dismissal comes amid a broader shift in the SEC’s approach to digital asset regulation under US President Donald Trump. The administration has signaled a more accommodating stance toward the crypto sector, with Trump publicly pledging to support mainstream adoption of digital assets and ease regulatory pressure on the industry. In its filing, the SEC stressed that the dismissal does not reflect its position on other crypto-related enforcement actions, underscoring that the decision was specific to the facts of the Gemini case. The exchange has continued to expand its institutional footprint following the resolution of the Earn dispute. Gemini made a high-profile debut on Nasdaq last year, reflecting renewed investor interest in regulated crypto platforms as the market rebounds. According to LSEG data, the company is currently valued at approximately $1.14 billion.

In 2028, it will range between $0.46 and $0.56, with an average price of $0.48. In 2031, it will range between $1.44 and $1.74, with an average price of $1.49. Unlike the common sentiment of being a meme token, ApeCoin (APE) has utility. APE is the native token of ApeChain. The token also has utility within an affiliated company, Yuga Labs, the firm behind the Otherside metaverse, Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), and Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) NFTs. Will APE reach $1? What will its price be in 2028? Let’s explore these and more in the Cryptopolitan Price Prediction from 2026 to 2032. Overview Cryptocurrency ApeCoin Symbol APE Current price $0.1884 Market cap $141.79M Trading volume $22.49M Circulating supply 752.65M All-time high $39.40 on March 17, 2022 All-time low $0.1624 on Oct 11, 2025 24-hour high $0.1948 24-hour low $0.1873 APE price analysis: Technical indicators Metric Value Price volatility 5.37% 50-day SMA $0.2186 200-day SMA $0.4418 Sentiment Bearish Green days 13/30 (43%) Fear and Greed Index 24 (Extreme Fear) APE price analysis At the time of writing (January 24), APE’s price dropped by 0.42% in 24 hours, underperforming the broader cryptocurrency market, which is up 0.11%. The coin fell 9.72% in the last 30 days. Its trading volume dropped by 13.56% in 24 hours, indicating a lack of market conviction. APE/USD 1-day chart analysis APEUSD chart by TradingView APE fell below $0.5 in October, and by January 2026, had fallen below $0.3, following a sharp decline over the last few months. In the third week, it fell below $0.2. The MACD histogram indicates its negative momentum slowed over the last 3 days. Its volatility rose over the same period. APE/USD 4-hour chart analysis APEUSD chart by TradingView The 4-hour chart highlights APE’s run this week. The coin remained neutral with a few failed recovery attempts, with the last attempt at $0.25. The 4-hour timeframe shows that its volatility is dropping. APE technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 0.2053 SELL SMA 5 0.1985 SELL SMA 10 0.2080 SELL SMA 21 0.2122 SELL SMA 50 0.2186 SELL SMA 100 0.2915 SELL SMA 200 0.4418 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 0.2140 SELL EMA 5 0.2156 SELL EMA 10 0.2144 SELL EMA 21 0.2153 SELL EMA 50 0.2470 SELL EMA 100 0.3182 SELL EMA 200 0.4265 SELL What to expect from the APE price analysis next? Over the short term, APE’s price analysis indicates that APE is neutral, as its positive momentum slows the recent drop. The Fear and Greed Index shows a greed sentiment among traders. Falling trading volumes confirm low conviction in the market trend. Why is APE down? APE’s rally reflects NFT sector tailwinds as the BAYC market cap surged, event-driven speculation, and technical momentum. Can ApeCoin reach $1? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, APE will break above $1 in 2030, driven by the growing utility and applications, such as in the metaverse. Will APE reach $100? It is unlikely that the APE price will be extended to $100 in the foreseeable future. At such a valuation, APE will be more valuable than the USDT stablecoin, which is more of a ‘household’ cryptocurrency. Can ape coin hit $1000? It is unlikely that the APE price will reach $1000 before 2031. Does ApeCoin have a future? With the launch of ApeChain, ApeCoin now has more utility and is, therefore, much more likely to last into the future. How much is ApeCoin worth in 2026? For 2026, the APE coin price will range between $0.10 and $0.33. The average price for the year will be $0.22. Is APE a good investment? APE’s utility is growing, and the launch of ApeChain is anticipated to attract more projects that use the APE token either for governance or settling fees on the chain. Yuga Labs and other new firms will likely promote APE. Recent news While Solana’s low fees attracted new users, the dissolution of ApeCoin DAO (99.66% approval) alienated decentralization advocates. ApeCo’s 10M APE treasury allocation ($3.72M) added inflationary pressure.

The agency claimed the platforms are aiding fraudsters in defrauding honest Nigerians through fraudulent schemes. The call was made by Wilson Uwujarem, Director of Public Affairs at the EFCC, during a briefing to the media about the negligence and compromise of financial institutions in the country. Uwujarren mentioned that the compromise has seen several Nigerians become victims of these crimes, noting that they have cumulatively lost billions of naira to these bad actors. He added that the EFCC has been able to uncover several frauds carried out in the Nigerian financial system. Nigeria’s EFCC wants platforms aiding fraudsters prosecuted In his statement, Uwujaren mentioned that so far, the agency has been able to uncover more than N18.7 billion in investment scams, while noting that fraudulent transactions with the use of digital asset accounts for N162 billion. He also accused one new generation bank, six fintechs, and some microfinance banks of helping these fraudsters launder their criminal proceeds. He mentioned that these institutions lacked the mandatory due diligence needed for heavy transactions. “It is worrisome that investigations by the EFCC showed that cryptocurrency transactions to the tune of N162 billion passed through a new generation bank without any due diligence. Investigations also showed that a single customer maintained 960 accounts in the new generation bank, and all the accounts were used for fraudulent purposes,” Uwujaren said. He added that the financial institutions were clearly compromised and allowed the fraudsters to move their illicit funds. Uwujaren mentioned that, like in every case that the EFCC reviewed, the fraudsters then change the funds into digital assets and move them to safe destinations after moving the funds through the Nigerian banking system. He also used the opportunity to call on all regulatory bodies to ensure banks carry out mandatory regulatory checks, including Know Your Customer (KYC), Customer Due Diligence (CDD), Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs), and others. The director also instructed the regulators to ensure that deposit money banks, fintechs, and micro finance banks found complicit in aiding fraudsters should be suspended and referred to the EFCC for thorough investigation and possible prosecution. Uwujaren added that some of the fraudsters used an airline discount scheme to lure their victims, while a company named Fred and Farid Investment Limited was complicit in fraudsters luring innocent Nigerians into a bogus investment scheme. Scammers targeting Nigerians in bogus investment schemes The director mentioned that the modus operandi of the scammers in the airline scam involved carefully devised airline discount information that any unsuspecting foreign traveler would fall for. “What they do is to advertise a discount system in the purchase of flight tickets of a particular foreign carrier. The payment module is designed in such a way that its victims would be convinced that the payment is actually made into the account of the airline. No sooner is the payment made than the passenger’s entire funds in his bank account are emptied,” he added. Uwujaren added that more than 700 victims fell into the trap of the fraudsters through the scheme, estimating the total loss to be around N651 million. He claimed that the EFCC was able to recover part of the funds for the victims of the scam, but cautioned Nigerians to be more vigilant. He added that more than 200,000 victims were scammed in another case they were looking into. He noted that the perpetrators raked in more than N18 billion through nine companies. He claimed that the company used bogus investment arrangements to lure unsuspecting residents of the country. Uwujaren said the nine companies offered several investment packages where users were allowed to purchase and invite others to earn more. He added that some of the perpetrators are foreign nationals, noting that the three Nigerian accomplices behind the crime have been arrested and charged in court. Don’t just read crypto news.

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $150L by the end of 2026 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2032, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Bitcoin’s outlook for 2026 has become highly debated. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs and the rally after the halving were expected to bring more clarity, but instead they’ve brought mixed volatility in Bitcoin price forecast. However, top analysts are bullish on BTC price prediction this year. Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, has predicted that Bitcoin could reach about $250,000 by 2026. He bases this view on Bitcoin’s limited supply and the possibility that institutions and major companies will continue to adopt it. Investor and author Robert Kiyosaki has made a similar prediction, arguing that Bitcoin’s scarcity makes it a strong store of value in a world where traditional currencies are becoming less stable. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction 2026 model.

Currently, the price is aiming for a consolidation within a bearish channel. BTC price analysis 1-day chart: Bitcoin faces selling pressure Analyzing the daily Bitcoin price chart, we see that Bitcoin faces bearish pressure as it dropped toward $89.4K. Currently, the BTC price is facing minor selling domination around immediate support channels. The 24-hour volume has dropped to $1.15 billion, showing a decline in trading interest today. BTC is trading at $89,581, decreasing by over 0.1% in the last 24 hours. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has dropped from its previous level and trades at 43.6, hinting that a bearish correction is on the edge. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. BTC/USD 4-hour price chart: Selling domination rises around EMA trend lines The 4-hour Bitcoin price chart suggests that bears are strengthening their position to hold the price below the EMA trend lines. However, buyers are aiming for a trend continuation above $100K. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a negative region at 0.07, showing that short-term sellers are taking a chance to accelerate a downward trend. However, the MACD indicator has formed green candles above the signal line, and the indicator aims for positive momentum, strengthening long-position holders’ confidence.

The hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin is attempting to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a recovery rally in the coming hours. If BTC’s price holds momentum above $91,410, it will fuel a bullish rally to $97,998. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $87,097, beginning a bearish trend to $84,509. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin down today? Bitcoin faced a surge in selling pressure as buyers failed to push the price above immediate fib levels. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $100K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC As reported by Cryptopolitan , Metaplanet increased its Bitcoin holdings by purchasing 4,279 BTC for $451.06 million at an average price of $105,412. The report revealed that the company held 35,102 BTC as of December 30, 2025 Bitcoin price prediction January 2026 Bitcoin’s price dropped toward $84K due to the rising bearish threat. However, it is now facing minor accumulation, which could mean we’ll see a recovery around January 2026. Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $95,000 and be pushed further, at least $105,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $82,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction January 2026 $82,000 $95,000 $105,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2026 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the years following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price after a downturn in 2025. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2026. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2026 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $150,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. Bitcoin price prediction 2028 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2028, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491. The potential maximum price is estimated to be $216,738, with an average value of $170,100. Bitcoin price prediction 2029 By 2029, Bitcoin’s price is expected to reach a low of $164,063. Maximum price projections are as high as $244,142, averaging about $185,068 for the year. Bitcoin price forecast 2030 Projections for 2030 suggest that Bitcoin could be valued at a minimum of $195,629. The price may peak at as much as $255,321, with an average throughout the year expected to be around $200,312. Bitcoin (BTC) price prediction 2031 The forecast for 2031 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $225,903 and potentially rise to a maximum of $270,593. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $248,568 throughout the year. Bitcoin price prediction 2032 The forecast for 2032 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $285,058 and potentially rise to a maximum of $350,548.

This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen the Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2026, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $150,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $100,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,738 by the end of 2028. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history: Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone. In May, Bitcoin price skyrocketed and it formed a new ATH at $111,970. However, the price declined later, toward $104K. By the end of June, BTC price reclaimed the $108K level. In July, BTC price triggered a surge toward $123K; however, it faced strong selling pressure later. In mid-August, the price of Bitcoin surged above $124K. However, the price failed to maintain its momentum as it dropped below $110K in early-September. By the end of September, the price of Bitcoin dropped further and touched a low around $108K. In October, the price of Bitcoin crashed heavily below $110K. The price crashed further toward $84K in November. Bitcoin ended December 2025 on a bearish note by trading below $90K.",Crypto Price Predictions|BTC,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|UNI|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-24 08:59:43
57431286,658869,1769245214,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57431286.jpeg,"Monero, Zcash, And Dash Prohibited In India Amid Money-Laundering Crackdown",https://bitcoinist.com/monero-zcash-and-dash-prohibited-in-india/,"India’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU‑IND) has launched a fresh anti‑money‑laundering crackdown aimed at privacy‑focused cryptocurrencies. The move targets Monero (XMR), Zcash (ZEC), and Dash (DASH), which together represent the largest and most widely used privacy coins globally. India Tightens Crypto Oversight Details of the action were shared on Friday by market analyst MartyParty on social media platform X (previously Twitter), who notes that FIU‑IND has issued a directive to crypto exchanges registered in India, instructing them to immediately suspend deposits, withdrawals, and trading activity for Monero, Zcash, and Dash. At the heart of the regulator’s concerns is the technology underpinning these assets. Privacy coins rely on advanced cryptographic techniques designed to obscure transaction details, wallet balances, and user identities. Monero uses ring signatures to hide the sender and receiver, Zcash allows shielded transactions that conceal transaction data, and Dash offers optional privacy features. While these tools are valued by users seeking confidentiality, regulators argue they make it difficult for exchanges to meet know‑your‑customer (KYC) and transaction‑monitoring obligations. The regulator views these features as posing elevated risks related to money laundering, terrorist financing, and sanctions evasion. The latest directive applies to all cryptocurrency exchanges registed in the country, which currently includes crypto platforms operating in compliance with Indian regulations. They have been instructed to stop supporting the assets, including delisting, blocking all deposits and withdrawals, and disabling any associated trading pairs. Monero, Zcash, And Dash Show Mixed Market Reaction The latest action builds on a broader regulatory push by Indian authorities. In October 2025, FIU‑IND ordered internet service providers to block access to 25 offshore crypto exchanges that failed to register. By contrast, only a handful of exchanges currently remain fully registered and compliant in the country. Binance, Mudrex, Coinbase, CoinSwitch (CoinSwitch Kuber), and ZebPay continue to operate legally in India. Despite the regulatory pressure , market prices for the targeted privacy coins showed short‑term resilience. Over the past 24 hours, all three assets posted gains after recovering from sharp losses earlier in the week. Monero was trading at $524 at the time of writing, up 3.5% on the day. Zcash also rebounded modestly, rising 2.2% to trade at $372. Dash recorded the strongest daily performance, jumping 11.6% during the same period. However, the broader trend remains negative. According to CoinGecko data , Monero, Zcash, and Dash are still down sharply on a weekly basis, with losses of approximately 21%, 8%, and 20% respectively over the past seven days.

CZ Rejects Allegations Of Binance’s Political Links Attention on Zhao intensified after President Trump issued a pardon in October 2025, a move that prompted renewed criticism from Democratic lawmakers and fueled questions about Binance’s alleged political and business connections. Addressing the controversy in a recent interview with CNBC, Zhao said claims of a business relationship with the Trump family are inaccurate. “There’s no business relationship whatsoever,” Zhao stated. The former executive added that the narrative surrounding the pardon and Binance’s alleged ties to Trump had been “misconstrued.” Related Reading: Binance Forms New Company In Greece, Moves Forward With MiCA Licensing Much of the scrutiny centers on Binance’s connection to the Trump-linked decentralized finance (DeFi) venture World Liberty Financial (WLFI). That connection traces back to a $2 billion investment made in March 2025 by MGX, a state‑owned firm based in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. MGX invested in Binance using USD1, a stablecoin created by World Liberty Financial. Zhao emphasized that the payment method was chosen by the investor, not Binance. “MGX is the investor. They choose USD1,” he said. “My request to them was they pay us in crypto. I don’t want to deal with banks, really.” According to Zhao, the use of the venture’s USD1 stablecoin has been wrongly interpreted as evidence of a deeper relationship. “Many people misconstrued that,” he added. WLFI Push Back On Political Influence Claims In a statement, WLFI spokesperson David Wachsman said the company played no role in the pardon process. “As we have stated many times, WLFI is not a political organization and had zero role in the pardon process,” Wachsman said. “To imply otherwise is dangerous and false.” Trump himself downplayed any personal connection in a November interview with CBS’s 60 Minutes. “I have no idea who he is,” the president said of Zhao. Trump added that he had been told Zhao was “a victim, just like I was and just like many other people, of a vicious, horrible group of people in the Biden administration.” Additional attention has focused on Binance’s lobbying efforts in Washington. NBC News reported during the week of the pardon that Binance had hired Checkmate Government Relations, a lobbying firm led by Charles McDowell, who is a friend of Donald Trump Jr. Related Reading: Expert Analyzes XRP, Ethereum, And Solana: Predictions For The Next Altcoin Season According to disclosures, the firm was paid $450,000 to lobby the White House and the Treasury Department on matters including “executive relief” and digital asset‑related financial services policy. Zhao denied that any lobbying effort was connected to his pardon. “There is a lot of media saying that there is some deal in place to get me the pardon,” he told CNBC in Davos. “As far as I know, that does not exist at all.” Binance’s former CEO also said he has never spoken directly with President Trump. “The closest that I got to him was today when he was doing the Board of Peace session,” Zhao said. “I was in the audience, about 30 to 40 feet away from him.” At the time of writing, Binance Coin (BNB) was trading at $893, having recorded a 4% drop over the previous week. However, it is one of the few cryptocurrencies to have retained gains year-to-date, with an increase of 30% in that time.

Here’s Next Likely Action,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-showing-same-setup-as-mastercard-and-visa-heres-next-likely-action/,"Crypto analyst Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto) recently shared a chart comparing XRP’s current price action to the historical stock movements of Mastercard and Visa. The analysis highlights that both payment giants followed a pattern that XRP is now showing. This comparison provides insight into potential growth trajectories for XRP from its current price of $1.95. Mastercard and Visa Patterns Mastercard’s stock moved from approximately $12 to $527.57. This represents a gain of roughly 4,296%. Visa rose from around $12 to $325.28, representing 2,611% increase. Both companies displayed a three-phase progression in price growth, marked by periods of consolidation followed by strong upward moves. XRP is currently in a setup that mirrors the early stages of these phases. This analysis suggests that the asset has the potential for significant gains if the pattern holds. Mastercard and Visa stock showed the same setup $XRP is showing now pic.twitter.com/gxupXWwPwh — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) January 22, 2026 Applying Historical Gains to XRP Using Mastercard’s 4,296% percentage increase, XRP’s current price of $1.95 could theoretically reach approximately $85.72. Similarly, applying Visa’s 2,611% gain gives a potential target of $52.86. These targets put XRP in a larger position compared to its current valuation, assuming the historical pattern repeats in the crypto market. Phase Progression Analysis The chart shows XRP moving through three distinct phases, similar to Mastercard and Visa. Phase 1 is the initial accumulation and early breakout. The asset began forming this with its brief resurgence in early January . Following Phase 1, XRP will experience a rapid surge. This move will push it to Phase 2, where another brief consolidation will occur. Phase 3 represents the final stop before more accelerated gains. XRP is currently transitioning from Phase 1 to Phase 2, which aligns with the historical trajectory of the two stocks. If the asset follows a comparable progression, it could experience rapid growth in the upcoming months . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Strategic Outlook Investors observing XRP should consider both the historical analogs of Mastercard and Visa and the ongoing market conditions. The alignment of these phases reinforces confidence in XRP’s growth potential while highlighting measurable targets based on established performance. XRP’s potential to reach these double-digit levels marks a significant opportunity for investors tracking the asset’s trajectory. The comparison provides a clear method to assess realistic upside, grounded in historical stock performance.

The move highlights BTC’s dominance across the crypto space, currently commanding over $1.5 trillion in market capitalization, while the closest asset, ETH, commands only $356 billion. BTC dominance is up 59% as of now, followed by ETH at 11%; the rest of the cryptocurrencies command a cumulative 29% share of the market. At the time of publication, BTC was down 5.97% on the weekly chart, trading at $89,449, with a market cap of $1.79 trillion. ETH had lost 10.24% on the weekly chart, trading at $2,953, with a market cap of $356.4 billion. The third-largest token by market cap so far is XRP, with a market cap of $116.5 billion. The XRP token was down 7% on the weekly chart, trading at $1.91. According to a Cryptopolitan report , spot crypto ETFs typically offer the most direct exposure to crypto by holding BTC, ETH, and XRP. The spot ETF’s value moves in correlation with the real-time price of the underlying token, with minimal deviation. BlackRock’s IBIT ETF leads the Spot BTC ETF space As of now, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) ETF is one of the largest spot BTC ETFs. Additionally, there is the VanEck Ethereum ETF (ETHV), providing exposure to Ethereum, and the REX Osprey SOL plus Stacking ETF (SSF) for Solana. Meanwhile, crypto ETFs tracking BTC hold approximately 1,502,560 BTC, according to on-chain data . That is roughly $134.5 billion in value, commanding approximately 7% of the total BTC supply. IBIT ETF commands the space, with total net assets of $69.75 billion, followed by Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), with total net assets of $17.37 billion. US BTC Spot ETF breakdown. Source: SoSoValue . Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) is the third-largest spot crypto ETF for BTC, with total net assets of around $14.4 billion. At the time of publication, IBIT ETF had realized a cumulative net inflow of $62.9 billion, FBTC had $11.46 billion, while GBTC had lost approximately $25.5 billion due to withdrawals. Investors have shown interest in ETFs due to their regulatory oversight, which provides greater transparency and protection. ETFs also offer easy access, just like regular stocks traded on U.S. stock exchanges. The CTX ETF offers diversified risk by holding multiple crypto assets. The strategy tends to spread the risk across such that if one asset in the basket underperforms, others might be in the green, balancing out the portfolio. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

The numbers mark a significant jump from the 7% share Apple held in 2024, making this the iPhone’s best performance yet in India, which ranks as the world’s second-biggest smartphone market by total units sold. Apple expands stores and adjusts pricing strategy India’s broader phone market, however, stayed stuck in place. Total shipments held steady at between 152 million and 153 million devices for the full year, according to market estimates. Tarun Pathak, who heads devices and ecosystems research at Counterpoint , pointed to several factors behind Apple’s gains. He cited the company’s range of phone models, increasing demand from buyers who see the iPhone as a status symbol, and better distribution across different sales networks. Apple executives have been highlighting India’s importance in recent months. During an earnings call in October, CEO Tim Cook said the company “set an all-time revenue record in India.” Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh added that active iPhone users in the country hit their highest level ever, while buyers upgrading from older iPhones reached a quarterly peak. The company didn’t break out specific India revenue numbers during that call. Apple has also been building up its presence on the ground. Last month, the company opened its fifth retail store in India, located in Noida. That marked another step in a store expansion push that kicked off in 2023. The company has also been increasing the number of iPhones made inside India’s borders. Earlier this month, Apple rolled out a new subscription package called Apple Creator Studio in India. The bundle, which includes creative software like Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro, costs ₹399 per month, or about $4.35. That price sits roughly 66% below the $12.99 monthly charge in the United States, showing how Apple is adjusting its pricing strategy for the Indian market. Premium phones gain ground as overall sales stall The robust iPhone performance coincided with a difficult period for the Indian phone market as a whole. According to Counterpoint’s tracking, total shipments have remained close to 152 million units for the past four years. Despite the often hectic holiday shopping season, shipments actually decreased by 8% to 10% in the latter three months of 2025 compared to the same period the previous year. Source: Counterpart research monthly India smartphone tracker. Pathak gave a number of explanations for the stopped growth. Individuals are keeping their phones longer before getting new ones. The number of people switching from basic feature phones to smartphones is declining. And more buyers are turning to refurbished handsets instead of new ones. Phones at higher price points continued to gain ground, but overall sales remained unchanged. Devices priced above ₹30,000, roughly $327, grew 15% during 2025 compared to the previous year. These pricier models made up 23% of all phones shipped, the largest portion ever recorded, according to Counterpoint data. That shift toward expensive phones has worked in favor of brands like Apple that focus on the higher end of the market, even as cheaper phone sales slowed down. Looking at total unit shipments, Chinese brand Vivo led the Indian market in 2025 with a 23% share, Counterpoint reported. Samsung came in second with 15%, followed by Xiaomi at 13%. Despite its record results, Apple didn’t crack the top three sellers by volume. That underscores how Android brands targeting budget-conscious buyers still control most of India’s market, even as premium devices claim a growing share. For 2026, Counterpoint predicts India’s smartphone market will shrink by about 2%. The firm warned that rising memory prices could hurt demand for cheaper phones priced below ₹15,000, under $170. Phone makers might respond by cutting back on cashback deals, reducing phone specs, or pushing prices higher. Still, average phone prices are expected to climb 5% in 2026, following a 9% increase in 2025. That suggests the trend toward pricier phones will continue.

The filings, submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on January 23, propose ETFs that would track the CoinDesk Crypto 20 Index, a benchmark measuring the performance of 20 leading digital assets by adjusted market capitalization. One ETF would cover Bitcoin and large altcoins like Ether , Solana, XRP, and Cardano, while another fund would exclude Bitcoin and use long index futures and short Bitcoin futures. Ark Invest to list the new ETFs on NYSE Arca ARK Invest’s new ETFs are set to debut on NYSE Arca, as the asset manager joins other companies vying for investors in diversified crypto ETFs. Late last year, WisdomTree also filed to register a CoinDesk 20 Fund in Delaware, marking a preliminary step toward a U.S.-listed ETF tracking the CoinDesk 20 index of the largest cryptocurrencies by market value. Moreover, similar to Cathie Wood’s firm, ProShares is seeking to introduce a CoinDesk Crypto 20 ETF that would track the index through derivatives rather than owning cryptocurrencies outright. Meanwhile, aside from the planned ETF launches, Cathie Wood’s firm has been dipping its hand in several other investments. For instance, Wood snapped up $7.27 million worth of Netflix shares on January 21. ARK’s Next Generation Internet ETF added 83,368 shares of Netflix Inc. despite the streaming company’s recent earnings release, which showed mixed performance. Over the past six months, Netflix stock has lost over 31% of its value; nonetheless, it still represents a 150% gain over the past three years. Around the same time, ARK Genomic Revolution ETF and ARK Innovation ETF collectively purchased 89,501 shares of Tempus AI, while ARKQ purchased 111,439 shares of WeRide Inc. ARK Invest maintains its 2030 bullish Bitcoin projections With one of its planned ETFs excluding Bitcoin, it raises questions about whether the company is losing faith in the asset. Nevertheless, speaking recently on Bitcoin, ARK’s David Puell said the next phase of the BTC market will be driven less by belief in the asset and more by the level and structure of investor exposure. He remarked, “In prior cycles, a lot of the infrastructure was still being built. Now the question is no longer if you invest in Bitcoin, but how much Bitcoin you want and through what vehicle.” For the time being, he found, the ETFs and digital asset treasury structures already have absorbed about 12% of Bitcoin’s total supply, well above expectations, and have been a significant source of price movement through 2025 — a trend he said would only continue into 2026. But he noted that, although demand has surged, early Bitcoin holders are taking profits at price peaks. However, the firm still has a bullish long-term outlook for Bitcoin, with a bear case around 2030 of roughly $300,000, a base case near $710,000, and a bull case of about $1.5 million per Bitcoin. Bitcoin fuels the firm’s lower and base-case estimates, and institutional adoption is the largest driver of the bull-case projections, according to Puell. He further commented that macro conditions — possibly the end of U.S. monetary tightening — could bolster Bitcoin, as risk assets generally thrive amid elevated liquidity. He remarked, “For bitcoin, U.S. liquidity matters more than global M2.” Join a premium crypto trading community free for 30 days - normally $100/mo.",News|ADA|Ark Invest|BTC|ETH|SOL|XRP,EN,0,0,ADA|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-24 09:50:49

A review of the chart shows that at the bottom, the “Basically a Fire Sale” band signals extreme undervaluation tied to capitulation and long-term accumulation, placing the cryptocurrency between $40,864.57 and $53,396.65 on February 1. Bitcoin Rainbow chart. Source: BlockhainCenter Next, the “BUY!” band reflects deep undervaluation with improving sentiment and historically strong long-term entry points, ranging from $53,396.65 to $72,004.99. Above it, the “Accumulate” band shows Bitcoin still undervalued but stabilizing, with gradual position-building typical in the $72,004.99 to $92,992.69 range. The “Still cheap” band suggests Bitcoin remains attractively priced as broader awareness grows, spanning $92,992.69 to $120,134.75. The “HODL!” band represents fair valuation within Bitcoin’s long-term growth trend, encouraging holding over aggressive buying, between $120,134.75 and $157,341.11. Beyond that, the “Is this a bubble?” band captures rising speculation and volatility from $157,341.11 to $200,444.36. The “FOMO intensifies” band marks momentum-driven gains outpacing fundamentals, projected at $200,444.36 to $256,880.02. The “Sell. Seriously, SELL!” band signals historically overheated conditions with elevated downside risk, ranging from $256,880.02 to $334,429.07. At the top, the “Maximum Bubble Territory” band reflects extreme speculation and unsustainable price acceleration, spanning $334,429.07 to $449,773.31 for February 1, 2026. Bitcoin price analysis With Bitcoin trading around $89,300 as of January 24, the price sits near the upper end of the “Accumulate” band. If Bitcoin continues to follow the Rainbow Chart’s long-term trend without entering a euphoric phase, the model suggests a transition into the “Still cheap” band by early 2026, implying a potential range of $92,992.69 to $120,134.75. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Technically, Bitcoin is slightly below its 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) of $90,313 and well below the 200-day SMA at $105,072. This setup points to near-term weakness and a broader cooling in longer-term momentum. The 14-day RSI stands at 42.84, placing Bitcoin in neutral territory but leaning lower. This indicates selling pressure has eased, though momentum remains insufficient to confirm a strong bullish reversal.

The step would open access to Bitcoin and Ethereum for people who have worked with the bank for years, not for every customer. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Sharp Reversal Leaves Over $800 Million Liquidated In 1 Day Private Clients First According to a Bloomberg report, the service would start in Switzerland and be offered only to select private banking clients, with any wider rollout dependent on rules and demand. The move is careful and measured. It is being tested with a narrow set of clients before any wider push is considered. How It Would Work Reports note that UBS has been talking with outside firms about providing the trading, custody and compliance pieces needed to make crypto trading run smoothly. Partners would likely handle technical tasks while UBS keeps the client relationship front and center. Those talks have been going on for months, and no final deals are said to be done yet. Why Now Wealthy clients have been asking for ways to own digital assets safely. UBS has run pilots on tokenized funds and has worked on blockchain payments before. The bank’s size and reputation mean it can offer a more cautious path into crypto than many smaller players. At the same time, changes in regulation and the broader market have made the plan more realistic than it might have seemed a few years ago. Based on reports, the initial offering would focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum. More coins could be added later, but that would depend on which assets meet the bank’s risk and compliance checks. UBS will reportedly decide what custody model to use and whether it needs third parties for trade execution. No launch date has been set. A Broader Trend Banks from different countries are slowly giving rich clients more ways to touch crypto, but each does it in its own style. Some offer ETFs and funds. Some go further and let clients trade coins directly. UBS’s cautious design fits a pattern where big banks move slowly, testing the systems before widening access. A handful of recent moves by other institutions show the same pattern. Related Reading: Bitcoin Influencers Get Spotlight In X’s New ‘Starterpacks’ What Comes Next Reports note that regulators and client interest will help decide how fast this goes. If rules in the US and other places stay friendly and clients respond, the offering could broaden beyond Switzerland. If not, the bank could keep the plan tightly limited. For now, the idea remains a plan under discussion rather than a product on the market. UBS’s steps reflect growing demand from wealthy investors for safer ways to hold crypto through trusted firms. The bank’s careful progress shows how traditional finance is testing the waters without rushing in.

While this remains unconfirmed, the report signals a shift in how major financial institutions could approach digital assets. Crypto commentator John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) shared this observation on X. The possibility of JPMorgan increasing its XRP holdings has generated interest because it aligns with ongoing momentum in U.S.-based spot XRP ETFs. RUMOR WATCH Sources suggest JPMorgan Chase may be quietly building exposure to $XRP ahead of potential spot ETF approvals. If confirmed, this would mark a major shift in institutional positioning toward crypto infrastructure. pic.twitter.com/zrzRfDY8Qd — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) January 22, 2026 XRP ETF Dominance U.S. spot XRP ETFs launched in late 2025 delivered historic results. Canary Capital’s XRPC ETF debuted on Nasdaq in mid-November and recorded approximately $58 million in trading volume on its first day. Other ETFs, including Franklin Templeton’s EZRP, Amplify’s XRPM, Bitwise’s XRP, 21Shares’ TOXR, and REX-Osprey’s XRPR, also launched between November and December 2025, attracting substantial investor interest. By the second half of December, spot XRP ETFs crossed $1.3 billion in assets under management. These products recorded positive weekly inflows through the end of the year, demonstrating sustained investor confidence in XRP as a liquid and accessible asset. Momentum Could Extend Into 2026 The strong performance of these products provides a clear context for why major institutions like JPMorgan might consider increasing exposure to XRP. ETFs offer regulated, transparent, and scalable access to XRP, making it easier for institutional players to enter the market. With multiple spot XRP ETFs showing record-breaking performance , it is reasonable to expect that 2026 could continue this growth trend. Investors see a pathway for XRP to benefit from broader adoption in financial markets. Spot XRP ETFs serve as a vehicle for institutions and retail investors to gain direct exposure without managing custody. Early inflows and high trading volume indicate that investor demand is not only substantial but also sustained, reinforcing the digital asset’s positioning within regulated channels. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Outlook for XRP U.S. spot XRP ETFs have proven strong institutional and retail interest in the asset. The combination of record-breaking ETF performance and rumors of JPMorgan exposure suggests a potential continuation of momentum in 2026. While the rumor is unconfirmed, it reinforces the narrative that XRP is becoming an increasingly relevant asset for institutional portfolios. With more ETFs set to join the market this year, JP Morgan Chase might not be the only institution increasing its XRP exposure.

BNB Chain’s Chief Growth Officer, Nina Rong, announced the compromise on X late on January 23, claiming the team had received reports about their CoinMarketCap account being hacked. At the time, she said they were still trying to confirm the details with the security and internal audit team. She warned users to be cautious when making any investment decision on any content posted on social media. How was the BNB Chain account compromised? Some hours after her first post, Rong shared another update that revealed the results of the investigation. According to her, the findings led them to believe the attack originated from a previous vulnerability linked to the CoinMarketCap community platform. “We have taken immediate action to keep the account secure and added safeguards to prevent a recurrence,” Rong wrote on X. Meanwhile, in the official post mortem, the community was commended for its vigilance which helped them flag the compromise quickly. “Security and user protection remain top priorities, and we’ll continue to monitor the situation closely,” the post mortem read . The previous CoinMarketCap vulnerability it spoke of was one that surfaced last year June when the security team identified a vulnerability related to a doodle image displayed on its homepage. BNB Chain’s account was hacked in 2025 Unlike the AI-generated image shared on the BNB Chain’s account on the platform, which seemed harmless, the doodle image the attackers posted on June 20, 2025, contained a link that triggered malicious code via an API call. This resulted in an unexpected popup for some users who visited the homepage. Once discovered, the CoinMarketCap team jumped into action to get rid of the problematic content. They identified the root cause and put comprehensive measures in place to isolate and mitigate the issue. “We can confirm all systems are now fully operational, and CoinMarketCap is safe and secure for all users,” the team wrote in the post mortem at the time. Account compromise has led to memecoins The AI-generated picture that was posted on BNB Chain’s CoinMarketCap account was one that depicted crypto’s golden boy, Changpeng Zhao posing with a pup named WAFFLE that had on a Binance hat. People on X seem to believe the same people behind the image may have bundled or promoted a memecoin called $WAFFLE on the BNB Chain . The picture made it look like an official endorsement from the BNB Chain’s team or, at the very least, a fun tie-in. The opportunists did not wait too long before they pulled the rug on the token around a $40k market cap. However, after the rug, the BNB trenches took over, running a CTO in an attempt to revive the token. The playbook is not a new one. In the past, a similar incident occurred, where hackers promoted a memecoin called $4, which pumped as high as 500% before rugging the token for around $4k in profits. Victims were later compensated, and rather than letting the token die, the BNB community rallied together in a bid to “mock the hacker.” They collectively bought the token and pumped it higher than it had previously been, flipping off the scammer and turning it into a viral narrative. Even CZ got involved at the time, highlighting what happened in a post on X where he revealed the hacker “dumped ALL his tokens for a $4k gain,” while “the community took over and bought the meme coin higher, as a mock to the hacker. Funniest come back by the community!” he wrote . Following the CTO and that vague endorsement from CZ, the token ran on steroids, reaching peaks of around $200M market cap at some point and helping many traders make bank in the process. The token became yet another symbol of community resilience on the BNB Chain and spawned related hype around BNB’s Four.meme as a token launchpad. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

According to authorities, the BitConnect crypto fraud is a case that involved several illicit acts, including global fraud, kidnapping, and extortion involving thousands of Bitcoin and millions in cash. According to the statement by the Indian agency, the suspects were arrested by officers attached to its Ahmedabad zonal office under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. The officials mentioned that the arrested suspects were 33-year-old Nikunj Pravinbhai Bhatt and 49-year-old Sanjay Kotadia. They claimed the suspects were arrested in an extortion case in relation to the BitConnect fraud . India’s ED apprehends two connected to the BitConnect crypto fraud group The money laundering investigation opened against the suspects was due to the multiple FIRs registered by the CID Crime branch in Surat against BitConnect founder Satish Jurjibhai Kumbhani and others. According to investigators, Kumbhani and his associates allegedly induced the public to invest in BitConnect Coin, with the organizers stealing the proceeds of the investment scheme to purchase Bitcoin and other luxury properties. The scheme ran between November 2016 and January 2018, involving the offering of unregistered digital assets through BitConnect’s Lending Program, which targeted investors worldwide, including multiple investors across India. In its statement, the ED mentioned that BitConnect claimed that it was a high-yield investment platform. The platform claimed to use a proprietary volatility trading bot that could generate returns of up to 40% every month for its users. The agency noted that the claims were lies and used to create a false sense of platform growth, including several fabricated daily returns of around 1% on its website. The funds were later diverted into digital assets controlled by the accused and his associates rather than being used for trading. The second FIR was registered in relation to the kidnapping of two associates of Kumbhani, Piyush Savaliya and Dhaval Mavani, allegedly ordered by Shailesh Bhatt. Authorities claimed that the kidnapping was to recover an investment in BitConnect Coin that was stolen by the associates. They claimed that he was able to extort 2,254 Bitcoin, 11,000 Litecoin, and Rs. 14.5 crore in cash from Mavani in exchange for his release. The ED mentioned that Nikunj Bhatt was an accomplice in the kidnapping and extortion. The agency claimed he received around 266 Bitcoin for his part in the operation, but has now gained control of 10.9 Bitcoin from his payment stash. Authorities claimed the suspects were involved in kidnappings The Indian agency claimed that Bhatt knowingly routed more than 246 Bitcoin using third-party crypto wallets to conceal ownership and origin, converting them into Ethereum and USDT before eventually moving them to multiple wallets, including those linked to Sanjay Kotadia. The ED also found that at least Rs. 20.70 crore was moved by Bhatt to wallets associated with Kotadia for crypto trading purposes, with Kotadia also taking Rs. 4.05 crore for similar purposes. The ED carried out searches at five locations on January 9, which led to the seizure of several digital devices, incriminating documents, cash, and freezing of assets, including shares and digital assets. The value of frozen assets was estimated to be around Rs. 19 crore. The Indian agency claimed that both men gave incomplete disclosures and lied during questioning, attempting to obstruct the probe despite repeated opportunities to cooperate. Due to this reason, the Indian agency branded them a flight risk and asked the court to allow them keep both of them in custody. The court granted four days of custody, urging the ED to charge the men as soon as investigations are wrapped up. Forensic analysis by the ED also showed transactions and exchanges showing the link between the two arrested men. The ED says investigations are still ongoing, but they have been able to seize Rs. 2,170 crore from one of the main accused. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

They seek assets in their first utility cycles and not tokens, which are mature. The on-chain behavior analysts note that the trend is re-forming with a group of Solana holders positioning into a cheaper altcoin sitting way below the dollar but soon reaching its next price level at 0.06. Solana (SOL) Solana (SOL) is still among the biggest smart contract networks in the market. It trades near to the figure of $128 with a market worth approximately $72B. Solana achieved good returns in the previous big cycle with users and developers joining its ecosystem. The initial rush catapulted SOL to the highest ranking in the Layer 1 assets and also made it a favorite among the big holders. Based on its current size, the analysts have indicated that forward returns can lack a resemblance to previous stages. SOL is being resisted at $138 to $152. The depth of liquidity is increased at this point and may slow down the revaluation. Some analysts have issued weaker predictions in the year 2026 and 2027 as a result of the gravity of the valuation. Unless new catalysts appear, they anticipate slower appreciation. This does not render SOL unattractive but instead it drives whales to seek out tokens at earlier stages of development where they could form much faster. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of the new cheap cryptocurrencies whales have been investing in. It is constructing a decentralized lending protocol having two markets in which loans and deposits can be borrowed and lent. The lenders provide assets in the pooled market and receive APY in the form of mtTokens. Through collateral, borrowers can access liquidity at specified loan-to-value trades offs. In the direct matching market, users borrow on the same basis but not depending on common liquidity. Mutuum Finance started its presale in early 2025 at $0.01. In Phase 7, the token is currently at $0.04. It is already funded at 19.9M and has 18,900 holders. The supply of 4B has sold 830M tokens. The opening price will be at 0.06 which will put Phase 1 participants with an increase of 500% on their entrance price. Utility Exposure As per the official X account of the team , Mutuum Finance is going to roll out its V1 protocol on Sepolia testnet in Q1 2026. V1 has collateral regulations, liquidation regimes and ETH and USDT support. Analysts reckon this will make Mutuum Finance no longer developmental but executional whereby borrowing volumes and fee data starts to take shape. It is one of the best windows with regard to early positioning. The mechanics of Mutuum Finance associates the lending process with the token in the form of mtTokens. In the process of paying interest, a portion of the income is paid to the lenders and the rest of the money is spent on buying MUTM in the open market. These acquired tokens are reallocated to stakers of the safety module of the mtTokens. Analysts attribute this to be attractive, as it generates buy pressure on the basis of revenue and not attention. When the borrowing goes up, the buy pressure goes up. Such a structure makes MUTM distinct concerning narrative-based assets that are subjected to social cycles. Size and Liquidity Asymmetry Solana whales realize that there are more multipliers developed faster in small assets. SOL has a market cap of 72B, and requires heavy inflows in order to have price movement. The Mutuum Finance is at the beginning of its lifecycle as its supply is still in the distribution stage and utility is yet to come. According to analysts, this size imbalance is one of the main reasons whales rotate into new crypto assets before they activate. They prefer tokens that do not require deep liquidity to reprice. In this context, some analysts outline a scenario where MUTM could move from its current presale band toward a $0.20 to $0.30 valuation during 2026, representing a potential 400% to 650% appreciation as the protocol enters its first functional cycle. Phase 7 is selling better than the previous stages. The observers in the market cited a recent whale allocation of $115K as evidence of long-term conviction. Mutuum Finance has also undergone an independent audit by Halborn Security and has a score of 90 out of 100 in CertiK token scan. This has played a significant role among whales due to the fact that DeFi protocols require security validation to process collateral and liquidation. Looking Ahead Other participation tools have been used to support onboarding. A 24-hour leaderboard was introduced daily to reward the best contributor with $500 in MUTM. The access to the card payment has increased the participation by eliminating the complicated conversions. Analysts attribute such mechanics to decreasing friction in late stages of distribution. Solana is still an important asset and whales seeking a higher asymmetry have been moving to Mutuum Finance as it enters its first utility window. Having set up V1 activation, as well as, revenue-related mechanics, analysts believe MUTM has turned into one of the most popular crypto assets that whales are monitoring before it hits the next price level of $0.06.

During the third week of January alone, investors put $362 million into 14 different crypto startups. That brings this year’s total past $1 billion, according to numbers from DeFiLlama . Early-stage investors hold steady The steady funding comes at a time when Trump’s trade threats have sent shockwaves through stock markets and other traditional investments. But people who invest in new companies say that kind of day-to-day market drama doesn’t really affect their decisions. “The ‘Sell America’ trade we are seeing is mostly occurring in the public markets, not on the fundraising scene,” said Annabelle Huang, who runs Altius and previously worked as a venture partner at Amber Group. She explained that venture capitalists work with young companies in early stages, so they don’t move in lockstep with broader market swings in the short run. Some investors are actually seeing opportunity in the current global tensions, Huang added. “They’re essentially looking for the next Palantir or Anduril, which are companies that benefit from the heightened tensions we’re seeing,” she noted. Still, she warned that “the uncertainty around geopolitical risks should bring caution to all investors.” It’s worth noting that fundraising numbers are down more than 50% compared to the same time last year, when crypto markets were riding high during a major rally. Where the money went The week’s biggest deals show how investors are picking their spots carefully. BitGo led the pack with a massive initial public offering that brought in $213 million, based on Nasdaq records. The company’s stock market debut was by far the largest transaction of the week. Superstate grabbed $83 million in a Series B funding round. Bain Capital Crypto and Distributed Global led the investment. The company works on tokenization, which means putting traditional assets on blockchain technology. It creates tokenized investment products, including a mutual fund based on Ethereum that tracks short-term U.S. government bonds. The company has filed paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission for this product. A Solana-based prediction market called Space completed a $14 million public token sale, showing that investors remain interested in betting platforms. The platform says it provides a fast environment for betting on economic, political, and cultural outcomes. Big traditional banks are also starting to warm up to digital money. UBS, the Swiss banking giant, is working on plans to offer cryptocurrency investments to some of its private banking customers , Bl oomberg News reported, citing sources with knowledge of the situation. The bank is now choosing partners to help launch the crypto service. UBS provides wealth management, investment banking, and asset management to individuals, companies, and institutions worldwide. The bank handles assets and creates investment solutions for clients across the globe. According to the report, UBS plans to start by letting a small group of private bank clients in Switzerlan d tr ade Bitcoin and Ether. If things go well and regulations allow it, the service could spread to other regions, including Asia-Pacific and the United States. UBS wouldn’t comment directly on the Bloomberg story. However, a company spokesperson said the bank i s wa tching digital asset developments closely and looking at projects that fit with what clients want, regulatory changes, market movements, and risk management. The spokesperson also pointed to the importance of distributed ledger technology like blockchain, which makes digital assets possible.

Prosecutors in Moscow accuse the EU-registered trading platform of actively supporting the Ukrainian side since the start of the full-scale Russian invasion nearly four years ago, and blame it for facilitating capital flight from Russia. Russian prosecutors target cryptocurrency exchange WhiteBIT Russia’s Prosecutor General’s Office has declared the activities of WhiteBIT and its network of affiliates and subsidiaries in the fintech W Group, “undesirable” in the Russian Federation, without elaborating on the consequences. A statement issued Friday alleged: “This European crypto trading platform is used by cryptocurrency exchanges and exchangers to conduct various transactions, including organizing ‘gray’ schemes to withdraw funds from Russia, as well as other illegal activities.” Russian prosecutors also highlighted that the exchange has actively supported the Ukrainian Armed Forces since the first days of what Moscow continues to call “the special military operation” on the territory of its neighbor. WhiteBIT is being accused of “implementing various programs in collaboration with the Kyiv regime institutions,” according to the press release, which further detailed: “In 2022, WhiteBIT’s management transferred a total of approximately $11 million to them. $900,000 was allocated for the purchase of drone systems.” The prosecutor’s office pointed out that the crypto company’s executives participate in international charity auctions, donating the proceeds for the same purpose. It noted that some of the UAVs purchased with the money end up in the hands of the Azov Brigade of Ukraine’s National Guard, regarded by Russia as a terrorist organization. “WhiteBIT cooperates with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine. Since May 2022, the exchange has been providing technical support to the United24 fundraising platform, created at the initiative of the President of Ukraine to collect cryptocurrency donations,” the announcement added, quoted by Russian-language crypto media in the region. Ukrainian-rooted WhiteBIT is one of Europe’s largest coin trading platforms WhiteBIT, which brands itself as the largest European crypto exchange by traffic, is certainly among the top trading venues for digital assets on the Old Continent. Founded by Ukrainian entrepreneur Volodymyr Nosov in 2018 and registered in Lithuania, it has become a major global platform, as part of the W Group, with millions of users across many countries. Nosov, who is also the CEO of WhiteBIT, has been recognized for his efforts to promote crypto adoption in wartorn Ukraine, including through various partnerships and charitable initiatives. Ukrainian coin usage spiked amid the bitter war with Russia, which also brought fiat restrictions imposed by the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) under martial law during the initial stages of the conflict. The invaded Eastern European nation ranked among the world’s top adopters in the 2025 Geography of Cryptocurrency report produced by the blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis. The authorities in Kyiv have been taking steps to legalize cryptocurrencies and properly regulate the country’s growing digital-asset economy. Their first attempt to do that, in early 2022, was postponed by the Russian military attack, which started in February of that year. In September 2025, lawmakers in the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine’s unicameral legislature, approved a bill “On Virtual Asset Markets,” as reported by Cryptopolitan. At the time, Nosov welcomed the development, emphasizing its significance: “A window of opportunity has opened for attracting crypto investments and repatriating foreign assets of Ukrainian crypto enthusiasts.” Meanwhile, Russia has also taken the path toward regulating rather than banning cryptocurrencies and related activities, although it’s clearly going to do it the Russian way. The country legalized the mining of digital currencies in August 2024 and introduced an “experimental” legal regime for limited crypto transactions the following spring. The temporary arrangement has been mainly used to bypass Western financial restrictions in cross-border trade and for strictly controlled crypto investment by “highly qualified” investors. Then, in late December 2025, the Bank of Russia announced a new regulatory concept that aims to recognize cryptocurrencies and stablecoins as “monetary assets” and expand investor access. Officials in Moscow are insisting the nation needs its own crypto infrastructure to tap into the profits generated by the booming mining sector, reduce dependence on foreign trading platforms and limit capital flight through digital assets.

Several altcoins have posted impressive gains over the past 24 hours, especially HYPE, which was in a free-fall state for about a week before that. BTC Stands Still Below $90K The primary cryptocurrency traded high during the previous weekend at over $95,000. However, the geopolitical tension between the US and the EU skyrocketed after the former’s president announced a new set of tariffs if the latter’s members continue to refuse to reach a deal on Greenland. As things progressed between the two, BTC kept dropping after the Asian and futures markets opened on Monday morning. It dumped to $92,000, but the bears kept the pressure on, and bitcoin quickly lost the $90,000 support. It fell further to a multi-week low of $87,200 on Wednesday when Trump took the stage in Davos.

OpenAI launched the initiative under its global OpenAI for Countries program, selecting a host of countries as the initial participants. These countries include Singapore, the United Arab Emirates, Greece, Estonia, Kazakhstan, and Jordan. The inclusion of Kazakhstan in the initiative marks a milestone in the country’s education and digital transformation agenda. With the inclusion, the country becomes the first Central Asian country to be invited by the artificial intelligence firm to be part of the program. The program will enable the introduction of ChatGPT Edu, a specialized educational version of the artificial intelligence, into national education systems, as reported in a statement shared by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education. Kazakhstan set to participate in OpenAI’s Edu Initiative According to reports, the statement was implemented under agreements reached following a Memorandum of Cooperation (MoC) signed in November 2025 during the visit of President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev to the United States. The participation of Kazakhstan and other countries in the program reflects a keen approach to artificial intelligence as a tool that helps teachers and educators rather than replacing them in the educational setting. The integration of ChatGPT Edu is expected to reduce the administrative and methodological tasks for teachers while allowing more personalized and higher-quality learning. While the initiative was implemented under a MoC signed in the United States, the main agreement was concluded between OpenAI , Freedom Holding, and regional partner Bilim Group. Under the program, 165,000 ChatGPT Edu licenses will be provided free to educational institutions in Kazakhstan. The licenses are expected to be spread across preschool, secondary, technical, and vocational educators, with about 100,000 licenses already earmarked for them. In addition, administrators and higher education faculty members would be provided with 62,800 licenses, while 2,200 licenses would be allocated to the participants in the Astana Hub ecosystem. The initiative was seen as a welcome development by stakeholders in Kazakhstan , with most of them highlighting the good it could do in the country. Deputy Prime Minister hails the Edu program The program was also hailed by Zhaslan Madiyev, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Digital Development, Innovation and Aerospace Industry, who said the initiative reflected the long-term vision of Kazakhstan. “We view ChatGPT Edu as a practical tool to support educators and develop a strong research environment, fully aligned with national education standards, security requirements, and the principle of equal access,” he said. In addition, the Minister of Science and Higher Education, Sayasat Nurbek, noted that the program is designed to improve academic capacity rather than automated education. “Artificial intelligence is not a substitute for people; it is a tool that amplifies human thinking when used critically and responsibly. Kazakhstan is not preparing users of AI; we are preparing its creators,” he said. ChatGPT Edu will help teachers create lesson materials, assignments, and assessments. In addition, it will also adapt content to different skill levels and work in Kazakh, Russian, and English. While AI can be used to assist in preparing evaluation criteria, the main activities, which include grading, remain solely with the educators. “Artificial intelligence should enhance the role of teachers by taking on non-core tasks,” Minister of Education Zhuldyz Suleimenova said. The program is expected to include regular training sessions conducted by specialists from OpenAI to ensure consistent, effective, and responsible use of ChatGPT Edu across teaching, administration, and research. Educational institutions will operate within secure, dedicated digital workspaces that are fully in line with the data protection and information security legislation in the country. Managing Director of Astana Hub Valeriya Te mentioned that the initiative will support several programs, including Tomorrow School and Tech Orda.

Analyzing the Massive USDT Whale Transfer Blockchain data confirms the substantial movement of Tether’s USDT stablecoin. This transaction represents one of the most significant single transfers of 2025, involving nearly three-quarters of a billion dollars in value. Whale Alert, a trusted service monitoring large blockchain transactions, publicly reported this activity, providing verifiable transparency for market participants. Consequently, analysts began examining the potential motivations and implications immediately. The transfer originated from a wallet associated with the HTX exchange, formerly known as Huobi. It then moved to an address identified as part of the Aave Protocol’s ecosystem on the Ethereum blockchain. Aave operates as a leading decentralized, non-custodial liquidity market protocol. Users can participate as depositors to supply liquidity and earn passive income, or as borrowers to obtain overcollateralized loans. Transaction Metric Detail Asset Tether (USDT) Amount 770,000,000 Approximate USD Value $769,000,000 Source HTX Exchange Wallet Destination Aave Protocol Network Ethereum Context and Background of the HTX and Aave Platforms Understanding the entities involved provides crucial context for this transaction. HTX, a major global cryptocurrency exchange founded in 2013, serves millions of users. The platform offers spot trading, derivatives, and custodial services. Aave, launched in 2017, stands as a pillar of the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) sector. It allows users to lend and borrow a wide variety of cryptocurrencies without an intermediary. This movement from a centralized exchange (CEX) to a decentralized protocol (DeFi) potentially indicates a larger trend. Institutional and large-scale investors often seek yield-generating opportunities beyond simple exchange holdings. The DeFi sector typically offers these opportunities through mechanisms like liquidity provisioning and lending. Therefore, a transfer of this magnitude suggests sophisticated capital allocation. HTX (Huobi): A centralized, custodial trading platform. Aave: A decentralized, non-custodial liquidity market. USDT (Tether): A fiat-collateralized stablecoin pegged to the US Dollar. Expert Analysis of Market Impact and Motivations Market analysts propose several plausible explanations for such a significant capital movement. Primarily, the entity behind the transfer likely seeks to earn yield on a stablecoin position. By supplying USDT as liquidity to Aave, the holder can earn interest from borrowers paying variable or stable rates. Given the size, even a modest annual percentage yield (APY) generates substantial passive income. Alternatively, this could represent collateral preparation for a leveraged position. A user might deposit USDT on Aave to borrow another asset, aiming to capitalize on market movements. Another possibility involves treasury management for a large institution, fund, or trading firm moving capital into a DeFi yield strategy. Regardless of the specific motive, the action demonstrates growing confidence in DeFi infrastructure’s security and reliability for handling ultra-large sums. Historically, large stablecoin movements often precede or follow significant market volatility. They can signal accumulation, distribution, or portfolio rebalancing. However, a direct move from an exchange to a lending protocol more strongly suggests a yield-seeking strategy rather than imminent spot market trading. This distinction is important for market sentiment interpretation. Technical and Economic Implications for DeFi The injection of $769 million in USDT liquidity directly impacts the Aave protocol’s metrics. It substantially increases the total value locked (TVL) in the USDT lending pool, potentially lowering borrowing rates for that asset due to increased supply. This creates a more favorable environment for traders and protocols seeking USDT loans for arbitrage, leverage, or operational needs. From a technical perspective, the transaction validates the scalability and robustness of both the Ethereum network and the Aave smart contracts. Handling a transaction of this value requires confidence in the underlying technology’s security. Furthermore, it highlights the maturing bridge between traditional centralized finance mindsets and decentralized finance applications, showcasing how capital seamlessly flows between these worlds. Regulatory observers also note such transactions. The transparent nature of blockchain allows for this tracking, which contrasts with opaque traditional finance movements. This transparency can aid in understanding capital flows but also raises discussions about privacy and surveillance in public ledger systems. Conclusion The reported 770 million USDT transfer from HTX to Aave represents a landmark event in 2025’s digital asset landscape. It underscores the deepening integration between centralized exchanges and decentralized finance protocols. This movement likely reflects a strategic decision for yield generation or collateral management by a major market participant. Ultimately, it signals growing institutional-scale utilization of DeFi, reinforcing the sector’s role in the broader financial ecosystem. Monitoring the subsequent on-chain activity of this capital will provide further insights into sophisticated crypto-economic strategies. FAQs Q1: What does a “whale transfer” mean in cryptocurrency? A whale transfer refers to a transaction involving a very large amount of cryptocurrency, typically initiated by an entity or individual (a “whale”) holding substantial funds capable of influencing market prices. Q2: Why would someone move USDT from an exchange to Aave? The primary reasons are to earn interest by supplying liquidity to the lending pool or to use the USDT as collateral to borrow other assets on the Aave platform, often for leveraged trading strategies or yield farming. Q3: Is a transfer of this size safe on the blockchain? Yes, the security depends on the blockchain network (Ethereum) and the smart contracts of the receiving protocol (Aave). Both are extensively audited and tested, though all blockchain interactions carry inherent smart contract and systemic risks. Q4: How does this transaction affect USDT borrowing rates on Aave? Adding a massive supply of USDT to the Aave liquidity pool typically increases the available funds for borrowing, which can put downward pressure on the borrowing interest rates for USDT, making it cheaper to borrow. Q5: Can the owner of this USDT be identified? While the blockchain address is public and transparent, the real-world identity of the owner is pseudonymous and not directly revealed by the transaction data alone, unless the entity voluntarily discloses ownership or is identified through other means.

While the premier cryptocurrency has cooled off over the past few days, optimism has never been this high in the market over the last couple of months. Adding to this optimism is Binance’s co-founder and former CEO, Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao, who predicted an extremely positive outlook for Bitcoin in 2026. BTC Could Abandon 4-Year Cycle Theory In 2026: CZ In a CNBC interview at the World Economic Forum, CZ said that he has “strong feelings” that the Bitcoin price will enter a supercycle in 2026. This prediction came as a response to the interviewer’s question about Zhao’s Bitcoin price outlook. In an economic context, a supercycle refers to an extended period characterized by the explosive growth of an asset or sector. Unlike a typical short-term rally triggered by hype and speculation, supercycles signal a significant shift underpinned by strong fundamentals over an extended period. Zhao explained to the interviewer that the price of Bitcoin moves in a four-year cyclical pattern, spanning periods of all-time highs and cycle lows. However, the former Binance CEO agreed with the ongoing narrative that believes that the premier cryptocurrency will break the four-year cycle theory this year. When asked about his strategy and current portfolio, CZ mentioned that he doesn’t trade the crypto market but rather accumulates coins with long-term promise. Specifically, the prominent crypto leader said that he keeps accumulating Bitcoin and BNB, the Binance ecosystem’s native token. In his interview, CZ also talked about life after his four-month stint in jail, mentioning his work with YZi Labs, Giggle Academy, and as a crypto advisor to various governments. Zhao, who received a pardon from United States President Donald Trump in October 2025, clarified the rumors around receiving clemency for violating the US Bank Secrecy Act. It is worth noting that CZ is not the first personality in the crypto space to speak about the Bitcoin price abandoning the halving-associated four-year cycle for a supercycle. Fidelity Labs managing partner, Parth Gargava, had echoed a similar sentiment about the BTC market earlier in the new year. Gargava highlighted three drivers as the factors behind the transition from the typical four-year cycle to a supercycle. “Steady buy-in by institutions focused on ETFs, policy, and market maturation and changing correlations,” the Fidelity executive listed as the catalysts behind the shifting market landscape.

Traders and investors are keenly observing if this is a sign of an impending turnaround or a prolonged decline. The outcome could significantly impact the performance of different coins. Readers can find out which tokens might be poised for growth in this uncertain market phase. Cardano Nears Key Resistance; Eyes on Potential Rebound Source: tradingview Cardano (ADA) is currently trading between the mid-thirty cents to just over forty cents. The coin has seen a drop of over fifty percent in the past six months. However, it might make a comeback if it breaks through this resistance level near forty-five cents. The next significant target would be around fifty cents, which represents a roughly twenty percent potential rise. On the downside, support levels are holding strong near thirty-four cents. With a Relative Strength Index close to forty-four, the coin is in a neutral zone, hinting at a possible recovery. Keep an eye on these levels as Cardano aims for a rebound. Conclusion ADA is holding its ground near a crucial support level. This stability might hint at an early reversal, suggesting that further decline could be avoided. Current trends indicate a possible shift in momentum. Continued monitoring of ADA's performance will be essential to determine its next direction.

For XRP, moments of market fear frequently revive a deeper discussion about utility, scalability, and the role blockchain technology could play in global finance. While charts dominate daily conversations, XRP’s long-term value proposition continues to rest on whether its technology achieves meaningful adoption in real-world payment systems. That long-term narrative resurfaced through a recent post shared by X Finance Bull on X, which highlighted a video of Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse speaking directly to central bankers. The resurfaced remarks arrived at a time when XRP’s price action unsettled many traders. However, attention has been redirected to the original problem Ripple set out to solve: the inefficiency of global payments. Hey $XRP Army, if you’re feeling scared by the price action today, think back to this moment Brad stood in front of central banks and clearly explained why Bitcoin can’t scale global payments, but XRP can When massive $XRP adoption kicks in Price will move higher Lock in pic.twitter.com/RmPmBUKzYB — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) January 23, 2026 Bitcoin’s Structural Limits in Payments In the video, Garlinghouse clearly explains why Bitcoin struggles to function as a global payments rail. He points to transaction speed and cost as major constraints , especially for high-frequency or low-value transfers. According to Garlinghouse, “Bitcoin today, per transaction basis, is rather slow and expensive,” a limitation that becomes more pronounced at scale. He contrasts this with XRP’s design, noting that the digital asset processes transactions far more efficiently. “XRP is very fast, about a thousand times faster per transaction and 1,000x cheaper,” Garlinghouse stated, emphasizing that its architecture suits real-time settlement rather than store-of-value use cases. Liquidity on Demand and the End of Pre-Funding Garlinghouse also addresses a core inefficiency in correspondent banking: pre-funded nostro and vostro accounts. He explains that these accounts trap capital and slow international transfers. “Our view in the future is you don’t have this pre-funding, and instead you can use a digital asset to have global liquidity on demand,” he said. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This model enables institutions to source liquidity instantly, even in less liquid currency corridors. By using digital assets as a bridge, financial institutions can move value without maintaining idle balances across multiple jurisdictions. The Internet of Value in Practice Ripple’s broader vision extends beyond large corporate settlements. Garlinghouse describes a future “Internet of Value,” where payments move as seamlessly as data. He highlights that the same infrastructure can support a multinational transferring $100 million and a freelancer in the Philippines receiving a $30 payment from a company in London. Both transactions benefit from speed, cost efficiency, and reliability. Adoption as the Defining Catalyst Analysts and commentators, including X Finance Bull, argue that XRP’s price will respond decisively once large-scale adoption materializes. This thesis ties valuation to usage rather than speculation. If banks, payment providers, and enterprises increasingly rely on XRP for on-demand liquidity, market dynamics could shift rapidly. In that context, short-term price fear may matter less than whether XRP fulfills the role its creators envisioned from the beginning.

Several digital currencies are experiencing notable accumulation. This article will uncover which coins are showing signs of potential growth, capturing the interest of savvy traders and setting the stage for a notable comeback. Dive in to discover the digital assets poised for a resurgence. NEAR Protocol: A Hidden Gem in the Upcoming Altcoin Surge Source: tradingview NEAR Protocol stands out with its high-speed, easy-to-use blockchain designed for scalability and low transaction costs. As the crypto market dips, NEAR is catching the eye of many who believe an altcoin season is approaching. It uses sharding technology, which boosts its capability to handle more transactions quickly. With a strong developer community and growing ecosystem, NEAR is positioned well for future growth. This coin's potential shines, especially when compared to similar moments in past cycles. Many investors are keeping a close watch, believing NEAR could lead the charge when the market turns bullish again. HYPE Token's Bright Future Amid Potential 2021 Market Patterns Source: tradingview HYPE Token is making waves in the crypto world. It's an innovative digital currency that focuses on decentralized applications and smart contracts. In the current market, where optimism echoes the patterns of 2021, HYPE stands out with its robust technology and motivated community. Its emphasis on ease of use and security makes it appealing. While the big players in the market are experiencing fluctuations, HYPE’s unique features could attract investors looking for the next big altcoin opportunity. As interest in decentralized finance grows, HYPE might be perfectly positioned to thrive. OKB Set to Shine as Altcoin Season Approaches: A Hidden Gem? Source: tradingview OKB is the utility token of the OKX exchange, connecting users to a world of opportunities. This coin lets holders enjoy trading fee discounts and access many platform features. OKB stands out for its strong ties with the popular trading platform and its dedicated user base. The coin's unique perks and growing ecosystem make it a promising choice for crypto enthusiasts. As market patterns echo 2021's bull runs, OKB might pull off a remarkable performance. With increasing adoption and real-use cases, OKB offers attractiveness in the current market cycle, setting the stage for significant gains ahead. BNB: A Bright Star in the Next Crypto Bull Run Source: tradingview Binance Coin (BNB) is the native coin of Binance, the largest crypto exchange. It started as a utility token to reduce trading fees but has grown beyond this. BNB is now used for many services on Binance’s blockchain too. Its active use and consistent burning, which reduces supply, make it promising. In the upswing like 2021, BNB shone brightly, showing strong growth. Its connection with Binance and an active user base offer a blend of scarcity and utility. As we anticipate another altcoin season, BNB appears well-positioned to rocket upwards, making it appealing in this market cycle. Conclusion Big players in the market continue to invest in specific cryptocurrencies. NEAR, HYPE, OKB, and BNB are still seeing steady accumulation. This trend suggests confidence in these coins' potential. The continued interest by large investors highlights their belief in the long-term viability of these assets.

The platform shared a post-mortem on X on January 23 stating that the incident happened when an unexpected scale-up error reset funding indices to zero, distorting funding P&L and forcing liquidations during the brief maintenance window. Paradex confirmed that the issue was operational, not the result of a hack or security breach. Paradex is an on-chain derivatives platform that allows traders to take leveraged, permanent bets while maintaining control over their money, rather than depositing assets with a centralized exchange. Paradex implements rollback after database upgrade malfunction Incident Post-Mortem – Jan 19 What happened On Jan 19, a planned 30-minute maintenance window to upgrade our database (to support growing demand) encountered unexpected issues during the scale-up process. A race condition during a service restart, while critical data… — Paradex (@paradex) January 23, 2026 Paradex said that a complete rollback to a healthy pre-maintenance condition was necessary due to the extent of the interruption across several users and marketplaces, making targeted solutions impractical. The platform briefly blocked access and initiated rollback procedures to restore the chain to a snapshot taken before the upgrade began. To ensure a controlled recovery, it canceled all open orders except take-profit and stop-loss orders. The platform further revealed that during a brief post-only period, a few users were impacted by aggressive trades that skewed prices and led to additional liquidations, mostly in PAXG. In response to impacted users, the platform stated that it had refunded $650,000 to 200 accounts from the Liquidator Vault after auditing every account affected by improper liquidations (as well as other lingering issues ). It further revealed that by Monday, January 26, all remaining data inconsistency concerns on the Portfolio and Vault pages should be fixed. Following the incident, Paradex said it implemented enhanced service restart procedures and additional data validation safeguards. The platform went on to say that it implemented a revised scale-up process for full-downtime maintenance periods. It also rolled out post-only period price band protection. The exchange further said that the changes it introduced since then strengthen its ability to operate safely as the system scales. Paradex, however, acknowledged the incident as its first chain rollback, describing it as “an undesired but necessary action to protect users and restore network integrity.” Infrastructure failures expose fragility across global trading platforms Recent incidents demonstrate how access to the cryptocurrency market and futures trading can be hampered by operational and infrastructure issues rather than hacking. On October 10 of last year, the decentralized exchange dYdX suspended trading for around eight hours due to mispriced trades and liquidations caused by a code-ordering issue and delayed oracle restarts. Cryptopolitan reported that the exchange proposed a governance vote to compensate impacted traders with up to $462,000 from the protocol’s insurance fund. Apart from dYdX, this incident put Binance’s trading services under pressure due to significant price fluctuations, user complaints, and regulatory attention. Traders expressed their displeasure with Binance due to technical issues that prevented them from completing their holdings. This entailed the depeg of Ethena’s USDe synthetic stablecoin and UI issues that showed several tokens with prices below zero. Following the outage, sources reported that Binance did not take responsibility for traders’ losses. Nonetheless, the crypto exchange launched a $400 million assistance program for affected individuals . The project included $100 million for affected industry participants and $300 million in token vouchers. Technical issues have also affected traditional derivatives markets. In November of 2025, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) suspended trading for almost ten hours due to a cooling failure at a CyrusOne data center in Illinois following concerns from traders. In the same month, Cloudflare, a provider of internet infrastructure, announced a “internal service degradation.” Users were temporarily unable to access exchanges, wallets, and data dashboards due to a problem affecting the front ends of numerous major cryptocurrency platforms. The downtime affected crypto firms such as Coinbase, Blockchain.com, BitMEX, Ledger, and DefiLlama. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

The shift follows Square’s November 2025 decision to enable roughly 4 million U.S. merchants to accept Bitcoin payments with zero processing fees through 2026. According to Fox5Vegas , at Cane Juice Bar and Cafe on Rainbow near Windmill, district manager Tyler Peterson serves fresh-pressed sugar cane juice that customers can pay for with cash, card, or Bitcoin after eight months of crypto implementation. “ Bitcoin is getting very popular with mainstream people, not just the people that are actually into things like cryptocurrencies, ” Peterson said, noting the payment option helps the business “ move forward ” while attracting new customers who specifically seek Bitcoin-accepting locations. According to FOX5, more businesses across Las Vegas are now accepting Bitcoin payments, from chains like Steak ’n Shake to small shops and medical practices. Merchants said Bitcoin helps attract new customers and cut costs, while Square has enabled about 4 million U.S. merchants… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 24, 2026 Small Business Growth Through Bitcoin Maps Peterson confirmed customers who normally wouldn’t know about his shop come in specifically to use Bitcoin, with calls and inquiries arriving regularly. “ So actually some customers we have generated off of accepting Bitcoin, ” Peterson said. “ That Bitcoin map is helping us out a lot .” Consumers can locate Bitcoin-accepting businesses through dedicated Bitcoin maps or Cash App’s directory feature, creating organic discovery channels for merchants willing to accept crypto payments. Jeremy Querci, a Bitcoin consultant with Sovreign, explained that businesses accepting Bitcoin now range from medical practices to juice bars to children’s play places, with payment processing requiring just a few taps on a phone. “ At the time of checkout, you say you want to pay in Bitcoin and the business can bring up a QR code that you scan with your phone with any Bitcoin app, ” Querci said, while Peterson asserted the technology will become progressively easier as “it’s the future.” National Chains Lead Corporate Bitcoin Adoption The momentum extends beyond small businesses into major restaurant chains, with Steak ‘n Shake announcing this week plans to pay all hourly employees at company-operated restaurants a Bitcoin bonus of $0.21 for every hour worked starting March 1, with funds accessible after a two-year vesting period. Steak 'n Shake announces Bitcoin hourly bonus for workers starting March 1, expanding its treasury strategy that contributed to 15% same-store sales growth. #Bitcoin #Salary https://t.co/HjlPK3TLtN — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 21, 2026 CEO Will Reeves positioned the move as part of the 91-year-old burger chain’s transformation into “ a real bitcoin company, putting sound money into the hands of working Americans. “ Lightning Network payments enabled across all U.S. Steak ‘n Shake locations in mid-May 2025 brought transaction fee savings of nearly 50% compared with credit cards, alongside roughly 15% increases in same-store sales in the months following launch. The rollout received public backing from Jack Dorsey, who enthusiastically endorsed the chain’s Bitcoin adoption plans when the company first polled followers about accepting crypto. Infrastructure Advances Enable Mainstream Payments Cash App rolled out Bitcoin Lightning payments and stablecoin transfers in November 2025, allowing eligible users to pay over the Lightning Network in seconds with no fee using either BTC or USD balances after scanning a Lightning QR code. The app introduced Bitcoin Map, an in-app directory that helps customers find nearby Square merchants and other businesses accepting Bitcoin, enabling users to locate stores, get directions, and pay directly over Lightning at checkout. Just yesterday, crypto payments firm Mercuryo partnered with Visa to enable near-real-time conversion of digital assets into fiat currency, allowing users to send proceeds directly to Visa debit and credit cards via Visa Direct. “ This partnership with Visa will further enhance Mercuryo’s ability to deliver a fast, low-cost user experience ,” said Mercuryo co-founder and CEO Petr Kozyakov, noting the integration reduces friction historically associated with moving funds across borders or cashing out digital assets. The corporate adoption mirrors explosive growth across the broader crypto payments landscape, with crypto card volumes surging from roughly $100 million monthly in early 2023 to over $1.5 billion by late 2025, representing a 106% compound annual growth rate, according to Artemis Analytics. Source: Artemis Annualized volumes now exceed $18 billion, while traditional peer-to-peer stablecoin transfers grew just 5% to $19 billion over the same period. At the time of publication, Bitcoin is trading around $89,500, down roughly 5% over the previous week, as Bitcoin spot ETFs experienced steep outflows totaling $1.62 billion across four trading days amid compressed yields on basis trades that dropped below 5% from around 17% a year ago.

Polymarket data shows a 45% probability that gold will outperform both BTC and the S&P 500 next year. Bitcoin, long seen as the premier digital store of value, lags at 36%, while the S&P 500 trails at just 17%. Amid ongoing market volatility, investor confidence in gold is surging. Long valued as a safe-haven, gold is now outperforming even top cryptocurrencies, drawing both institutional and retail attention after gaining over 70% since last year. The timing of this shift is critical. Gold has hit a new all-time high of $4,982 per ounce, driven by inflationary pressures, geopolitical tensions, and volatile interest rates. Analysts note that these macroeconomic factors, coupled with capital rotating into safer assets, position gold as a potential top performer in 2026. While Bitcoin dominates the crypto space, its volatility deters risk-averse investors, currently trading at the $89K zone. As a result, Polymarket odds show traders see Bitcoin’s upside but are increasingly valuing gold’s stability, a subtle rotation from speculative assets to reliable stores of value. Amid this shift, XRP may be primed to outpace gold after seven years of decline. Historically a safe haven during financial turbulence, gold is poised for renewed prominence in 2026, reaffirming its role as a cornerstone of diversified portfolios. While Bitcoin continues to attract growth-focused investors, gold’s hedge against uncertainty may trigger significant accumulation as the year begins. For those shaping strategic portfolios, this marks a critical juncture: will Bitcoin reclaim dominance, or will gold’s historic resilience define the next market cycle? Either way, 2026 could be a turning point where traditional and digital stores of value compete for supremacy. Gold is back, not as a relic, but as a powerful force in tomorrow’s financial landscape. Conclusion As gold outpaces Bitcoin and the S&P 500 in 2026, it shows that markets are cyclical and sentiment can shift fast. While digital assets grab headlines, gold’s enduring stability and record highs reinforce its role as a reliable hedge and portfolio anchor. With Bitcoin and equities poised for swings, gold is reclaiming its place as a dominant store of value, making 2026 a pivotal year for growth-minded and risk-conscious investors alike.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-24 11:12:03

In 2026, the way bettors place wagers on races has evolved, with cryptocurrencies becoming an increasingly popular payment option. This guide explains how to bet on horse racing with crypto , from choosing the right platform to understanding odds, markets, and payouts. Whether you are new to racing or transitioning from traditional betting, crypto brings speed, flexibility, and global access to an otherwise traditional betting market. What Is Horse Racing Crypto Betting? Horse racing crypto betting allows players to place wagers on races using cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, or stablecoins instead of fiat money. The betting mechanics remain the same — only the payment layer changes. With horse racing betting with crypto, deposits are made directly from a crypto wallet, bets are placed on available race markets, and winnings are withdrawn back to the wallet without involving banks or card processors. This approach appeals to bettors who value faster payouts and fewer payment restrictions. Why Use Crypto for Horse Racing Bets Crypto has proven to be a natural fit for horse racing wagering for several reasons: Speed: Crypto deposits are typically instant, and withdrawals are often processed faster than traditional banking methods. Global access: Bettors can access races from different countries without worrying about local banking limitations. Payment independence: No cards, chargebacks, or third-party payment blocks. Control: Funds remain under the bettor’s control until placed on a wager. These advantages have driven steady growth in horse racing crypto betting, particularly among experienced bettors who value efficiency. How to Bet on Horse Racing with Crypto: Step-by-Step Step 1: Choose a Crypto Betting Platform The first step is selecting a platform that supports horse racing and crypto payments. Look for clear betting rules, transparent odds, and a solid reputation. Some platforms focus on decentralized or crypto-native infrastructure, while others adapt traditional racebooks to accept digital assets. Step 2: Deposit Crypto After registration, deposit your preferred cryptocurrency into your betting account. Most platforms provide a wallet address or QR code. Always double-check the network and address before sending funds. Step 3: Select a Race and Market Browse available races by region, track, or start time. Once you select a race, review the available betting markets and odds. Step 4: Place Your Bet Choose your stake, confirm the odds, and place the bet. Crypto platforms usually lock odds at the moment of confirmation, just like traditional sportsbooks. Step 5: Withdraw Winnings After the race is settled, winnings can be withdrawn back to your wallet. With crypto horse racing betting, payouts are typically processed much faster than bank-based methods. Popular Horse Racing Betting Markets Explained Horse racing offers a wide range of markets, making it attractive to both beginners and advanced bettors. Win: Your selected horse must finish first. Place: The horse must finish within the top positions (usually first or second). Show: The horse must finish in the top three. Each-way: A combination of win and place bets. Exacta: Picking the first two horses in the correct order. Trifecta: Picking the first three horses in exact order. Superfecta: Picking the first four finishers. Many platforms also offer live or in-play betting, allowing wagers to be placed as races approach the start. Using Dexsport for Horse Racing Crypto Betting Dexsport is a licensed, decentralized sportsbook and casino platform built specifically for crypto users who prioritize speed, privacy, and transparency. Launched in 2022, the platform operates under regulation from the Government of the Autonomous Island of Anjouan (Union of Comoros) and has positioned itself as a full Web3 betting ecosystem rather than a traditional sportsbook with crypto add-ons. One of Dexsport’s defining characteristics is its no-KYC approach. Players can register instantly using email, Telegram, or DeFi wallets such as MetaMask and Trust Wallet, without submitting personal documents. This makes the platform particularly attractive for bettors who want to place horse racing bets with crypto while maintaining full anonymity. Key Features of Dexsport Decentralized, crypto-native platform with on-chain transparency No identity verification required for registration or betting Over 40 supported cryptocurrencies across 20 blockchain networks Fast, fee-free deposits and withdrawals On-chain bet tracking, allowing wagers and outcomes to be verified publicly Cash Out feature available on in-play bets, enabling early profit locking or risk reduction Dexsport has also undergone smart contract audits by CertiK and Pessimistic and holds approvals from ECHELON, reinforcing its credibility within the global Web3 gaming ecosystem.

The platform’s multi-chain support reduces delays caused by network congestion, while its crypto-only payment system ensures that payouts are not slowed down by banking procedures. Odds, Payouts, and Crypto Withdrawals Horse racing odds may be presented as fixed odds or through pari-mutuel systems, depending on the platform. Fixed odds lock in your payout when the bet is placed, while pari-mutuel payouts depend on the total betting pool. With online horse racing crypto betting, payouts are calculated automatically once results are finalized. Crypto withdrawals usually follow shortly after settlement, though processing times depend on platform approval systems and blockchain conditions. Safety Tips and Bankroll Management Horse racing can be unpredictable, making discipline essential: Set a clear bankroll and stick to it Avoid chasing losses across multiple races Start with simple markets before moving to exotic bets Test withdrawals with small amounts before scaling up Responsible bankroll management is just as important as selecting the right horses. Legal Considerations for Horse Racing Crypto Betting Regulations around horse racing and crypto betting vary by country. Some jurisdictions permit horse racing bets but restrict online gambling payments, while others allow offshore platforms to operate with limited oversight. Bettors should always understand local laws and use platforms responsibly. Crypto simplifies payments, but it does not remove the need to comply with regional regulations. Horse Racing Crypto Betting Trends in 2026 By 2026, several trends are shaping the market: Increased adoption of crypto-native racebooks Faster payout expectations as a standard Growth of mobile-first betting platforms Greater interest in global race coverage As technology improves, crypto is becoming a mainstream option rather than a niche alternative. Final Thoughts Horse racing remains a sport where timing, knowledge, and discipline play a decisive role — and crypto has only enhanced that experience. Faster payouts, global access, and direct wallet control have made crypto betting an increasingly attractive option for modern players. In 2026, crypto sportsbooks offer a practical alternative to traditional racebooks by removing banking friction and providing greater flexibility across betting markets. Platforms like Dexsport demonstrate how decentralized infrastructure, transparent operations, and competitive bonuses can improve the overall betting process. By choosing reliable crypto sportsbooks, understanding horse racing markets, and managing bankroll responsibly, bettors can take full advantage of what crypto-based horse racing betting has to offer — both now and in the years ahead.",More News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitzo', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitzo,2026-01-24 11:15:51

However, it is very volatile, and human traders can find it difficult to monitor and navigate continuously. AI crypto trading agents have become essential tools for trading in and navigating the crypto markets. They offer automated crypto trading strategies that respond to market movements faster than manually stacking up gains. The top AI trading bots in 2026 are trading software that can perform sentiment analysis, pattern recognition, and strategy optimization, going beyond simple automation. The market for free cryptocurrency trading bots has expanded dramatically, and professional traders managing large portfolios can now access sophisticated features through paid cryptocurrency AI tools. This guide examines both free crypto trading bot 2026 options and premium AI tools for crypto trading, providing detailed comparisons of AI crypto trading software to help you select the right automated crypto trading agents that suit your investment strategy. What Are AI Trading Agents? AI trading agents are software that use artificial intelligence to trade crypto with little or no human interaction. AI agents use algorithms and machine learning models to determine the best investment strategies based on market conditions, in contrast to traditional bots that trade according to a predetermined set of rules. The core technologies behind the best AI trading bots 2026 include the following: Machine Learning (ML) AI trading bots use ML to improve performance over time by learning from their previous performance, historical price data, trading volumes, and other market conditions. ML enables these trading bots to identify patterns that human technical analysis might miss. Natural Language Processing (NLP) NLP enables AI tools for crypto trading to analyze and understand social media , news articles, which will help it determine current market sentiments. According to some experts, trading strategies that include market sentiments often outperform other types of strategies by up to 18% in the crypto market. Reinforcement Learning This type of core tech helps automated crypto trading agents optimize decision-making by rewarding profitable trades and penalizing losses. This creates a system that helps the agent to continuously refine its trading strategy. How AI Agents Work in Crypto Markets It is important for traders to understand how AI crypto trading agents work to help them select the tools that best align with their trading goals and strategy. The best AI trading bots 2026 function through the following processes: Data Ingestion These paid crypto AI tools and free versions of crypto trading bots continuously collect information from multiple sources, including exchange price feeds, trading volumes, blockchain metrics, and social sentiment indicators. High-frequency data collection allows the AI tools for crypto trading to detect opportunities within milliseconds. Strategy Generation & Optimization Using machine learning algorithms, automated crypto trading agents identify profitable patterns and generate trading strategies. AI-driven cryptocurrency trading systems can process over a hundred thousand market signals simultaneously, far exceeding anything a regular human can do. Risk Management The best AI crypto trading bots implement dynamic position sizing, stop-loss automation, and portfolio rebalancing. Instead of using fixed position sizes when trading, these AI crypto trading software consider the market volatility and account balance to help reduce the risk of making large losses. Execution Timing By examining order flow, liquidity depth, and past volatility trends, AI cryptocurrency trading agents identify exact entry and exit points. When compared to manual trading, using AI bots to trade cryptocurrencies can greatly reduce slippage. Self-Learning Behavior In order to improve performance over time, the most sophisticated AI tools for cryptocurrency trading use reinforcement learning, modifying parameters according to which strategies yield the highest risk-adjusted returns. What To Consider Before Choosing an AI Trading Tool The following are the important factors to evaluate before making a choice out of the numerous AI crypto trading agents: Security & Custodial Access According to cybersecurity firm CipherTrace, over $300 million in cryptocurrency was stolen through compromised trading bot API keys. When connecting crypto trading bots, free or paid versions, to your exchange accounts, you should never expose your API keys. The best AI trading bots 2026 use read-only or trade-only permissions without withdrawal capabilities so even if your API keys are compromised, your money can’t be withdrawn. Always verify that AI crypto trading software employs encryption and two-factor authentication. Backtesting & Historical Performance Any AI tools for crypto trading that you can trust would allow you to look under the hood to transparent backtest results and assess how their automated crypto trading strategies stack up over time. As a general rule, be skeptical of platforms that claim consistently high monthly returns if you can’t verify them by yourself. Customizability vs Pre-Built Strategies Some AI crypto trading agents are beginner-friendly, offering plug-and-play strategies, while others allow experienced traders with technical knowledge to design and tweak their own strategies. The best trading bots provide a balance between ease of use and customizability, giving you an option to choose depending on your needs and requirements. Pricing Structure Some crypto trading bots offer a free tier, which often includes basic features with limitations on trading volume and complex strategies. Paid tools typically charge monthly subscriptions depending on features, performance, and customizability. Supported Exchanges Before choosing an AI crypto trading software, ensure that it works with the exchanges you use. Most automated crypto trading platforms support major exchanges like Binance, Coinbase , and Kraken. Community & Support An AI trading tool with a strong user community and reliable customer support can make a huge difference, especially when you need to debug or refine strategies.

Unlike most team sports, races are short, markets move quickly, and betting volume concentrates in narrow time windows just before the start. By 2026, this dynamic has made horse racing one of the most demanding sports for online betting platforms. As traditional racebooks continue to rely on banking systems and regional restrictions, many bettors are shifting toward horse racing crypto betting online . Crypto-based platforms offer faster access to markets, direct wallet payments, and fewer interruptions during peak betting moments. This article explores which crypto betting sites are best suited for horse racing in 2026 and what makes a platform truly capable of handling fast-moving race markets. How Horse Racing Betting Markets Differ From Other Sports Horse racing betting operates under a fundamentally different structure than football, basketball, or tennis. Races are frequent, often overlapping across tracks and countries, and most betting activity happens minutes — sometimes seconds — before the race begins. Another key difference is market variety. While many sports focus on spreads and totals, horse racing relies heavily on outcome-based and combination bets. This creates complex pricing dynamics and requires platforms to handle rapid odds updates without freezing markets or delaying bet execution. Because of this structure, horse racing betting with crypto has gained traction among bettors who need uninterrupted access to markets and quick settlement after results are finalized. Crypto-native platforms are often better equipped to support multiple tracks, international race cards, and high-frequency betting activity without the bottlenecks seen on traditional racebooks. In the next section, we’ll break down what specifically makes a horse racing crypto betting site suitable for fast markets — and why not all crypto sportsbooks meet those standards. What Makes a Crypto Horse Racing Betting Site Ideal in 2026 Not every crypto sportsbook is built to handle horse racing efficiently. While many platforms technically offer racing markets, only a smaller group is truly optimized for the fast, high-turnover nature of the sport. In 2026, bettors look beyond basic crypto support. The real difference lies in how a platform performs under pressure — especially in the minutes leading up to post time. A strong horse racing crypto betting site typically shares several key characteristics. Stable market execution close to race start, without frequent suspensions Rapid odds updates that reflect late money flows accurately Support for multiple tracks and regions, often running simultaneously Quick bet confirmation, even during peak traffic Fast settlement once results are official These factors matter more in horse racing than in most other sports. A delay of a few seconds can mean missed odds or rejected wagers, particularly for bettors targeting value late in the market. Another important aspect is platform flexibility. Horse racing bettors often place a mix of simple and complex bets within a short time frame. Platforms that struggle with combination wagers or restrict certain bet types close to the start quickly lose relevance. This is where horse racing crypto betting sites tend to outperform traditional racebooks. Crypto-native infrastructure allows platforms to process deposits, wagers, and withdrawals without relying on banking intermediaries — reducing friction during the busiest moments of the betting cycle. In short, the ideal platform in 2026 is not just one that accepts crypto, but one that is structurally designed for fast-moving racing markets. Best Horse Racing Crypto Betting Sites in 2026 Not all crypto betting platforms are equally suited for horse racing. Some excel at fast execution and late market access, while others focus on broader sportsbook coverage with racing included as an add-on. Below are crypto platforms that stand out in 2026 for their ability to handle fast-moving horse racing markets, reliable payouts, and overall usability. Dexsport — Built for Fast Crypto Betting Markets Dexsport stands out as a platform designed from the ground up for speed, transparency, and uninterrupted betting. Rather than adapting traditional sportsbook infrastructure, it operates as a crypto-native ecosystem — a key advantage for horse racing. Race markets benefit from quick bet confirmation and minimal friction close to post time. The platform’s decentralized architecture allows bettors to enter and exit positions without relying on banking systems or delayed approvals. Key strengths for horse racing bettors include: Crypto-only deposits and withdrawals across multiple networks No mandatory KYC for registration or betting Fast market access during peak race windows Cash-out functionality for in-play risk management On-chain transparency for wager verification For bettors who focus on timing and execution rather than bonus chasing, Dexsport fits naturally into a fast-market betting strategy. Lucky Block — Crypto Platform With Broad Sports Focus Lucky Block approaches betting as part of a wider crypto ecosystem, combining sportsbook, casino, and esports under one interface. Its visual design is modern and performance-oriented, and payouts are often processed within minutes. The platform supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies and offers very low minimum deposits, which makes it accessible to casual users. From a racing perspective, Lucky Block is more suitable for bettors who mix horse racing with other sports rather than focusing exclusively on race markets. Pros worth noting: Wide crypto support and near-instant payouts Large welcome bonus and frequent promotion Simple onboarding, including wallet-based access However, horse racing markets are not always as deep or consistently available as on specialized racebooks. Some users also report account checks during withdrawals, which can slow down access to funds during busy periods. BetOnline — Traditional Racebook With Crypto Support BetOnline is one of the most established offshore sportsbooks still active in 2026. Its racebook offering is integrated alongside sports betting, casino games, and poker, creating an all-in-one environment. For horse racing bettors, BetOnline provides familiarity. Markets are clearly structured, race listings are extensive, and crypto payments are supported alongside fiat options. What BetOnline does well: Strong racebook experience with multiple tracks Early lines and consistent market availability Crypto withdrawals that are faster than many legacy platforms That said, the interface feels dated compared to newer crypto-native sites, and identity verification may be required for larger withdrawals. BetOnline suits bettors who prefer a traditional betting flow with the added convenience of crypto payments. BetNow — Straightforward Crypto Horse Racing Betting BetNow focuses on simplicity. Its platform is built for casual and mid-level bettors who want quick access to betting markets without advanced tools or complex layouts. Horse racing is offered as part of a broader sportsbook and casino setup. Markets cover the basics, and crypto deposits and withdrawals are supported with relatively low entry requirements. Key characteristics include: Beginner-friendly interface Integrated racebook alongside major sports Fast crypto payouts for most users The trade-off is depth. Live betting options and advanced race analytics are limited, and bonus wagering requirements can be higher than average. BetNow works best for bettors who place occasional race bets rather than high-frequency strategies. Each of these platforms serves a slightly different type of bettor. Some prioritize speed and market access, others value familiarity or low entry barriers. Understanding these differences is essential when choosing among horse racing crypto betting sites built for fast markets. How Blockchain Improves Horse Racing Betting Blockchain technology has quietly reshaped how horse racing bets are placed and settled. While the core of the sport remains unchanged, the infrastructure behind betting has become faster, more transparent, and less dependent on intermediaries. One of the biggest improvements is execution. Crypto-based platforms process wagers directly, without routing payments through banks or card networks. This reduces delays, especially in the narrow time window before post time when markets are most active. Another major shift is transparency. On crypto-native platforms, transactions and bet records are easier to track and verify. This adds confidence in markets where timing and accuracy are critical. Blockchain-driven betting also improves global access. Horse racing runs nearly around the clock, across different regions and time zones. Crypto platforms make it easier to access international tracks without worrying about local banking restrictions or currency conversions. In practical terms, blockchain improves horse racing betting by offering: Faster bet confirmation near race start Quicker settlement once results are official Reduced reliance on third-party payment providers Greater consistency during high-traffic periods These advantages are especially noticeable for bettors focused on fast markets rather than long-term futures. Tips for Betting on Fast Crypto Horse Racing Markets Speed alone does not guarantee success. Horse racing remains one of the most volatile betting environments, and fast execution must be paired with discipline and preparation. One of the simplest rules is timing. Markets often move sharply in the final minutes before a race. Being able to place a bet quickly matters, but so does knowing when not to chase shifting odds. A few practical tips help manage fast-market conditions: Place test bets early to understand how a platform behaves near post time Focus on markets you understand rather than spreading stakes across too many races Avoid platforms that frequently suspend markets before the start Keep bet sizes consistent to reduce emotional decisions Another important consideration is withdrawals. Before committing larger amounts, test the payout process with a small win. Platforms built for fast markets should handle withdrawals with the same efficiency as deposits. Finally, remember that fast markets reward preparation. Bettors who approach races with a clear plan tend to perform better than those reacting late to odds movement. What to Avoid on Crypto Horse Racing Betting Sites Not every platform that offers crypto betting is suited for horse racing. Some issues only become visible once real money is on the line — often at the worst possible moment, right before a race goes off. One common problem is market freezing. Certain platforms suspend betting too early, especially when liquidity spikes. This makes it difficult to react to late information or odds movement. Another red flag is inconsistent execution. If bets take several seconds to confirm — or worse, fail altogether — the platform is not built for fast markets. Things worth watching out for include: Frequent market suspensions close to post time Slow or unreliable bet confirmation Hidden withdrawal checks triggered after wins Poor coverage of international tracks Vague rules around bet settlement Bonus structures can also be misleading. Aggressive promotions sometimes come with restrictive wagering requirements that limit flexibility on horse racing markets. For anyone serious about horse racing crypto betting online, avoiding these pitfalls is just as important as choosing the right odds. Final Thoughts Horse racing is one of the most demanding betting environments in the world. Markets move fast, margins are thin, and timing often determines the difference between value and missed opportunity. In 2026, horse racing betting with crypto has become a practical solution for bettors who need speed, flexibility, and uninterrupted market access. Crypto-native platforms remove banking friction and are better equipped to handle the rapid pace of race betting. The best horse racing crypto betting sites are not defined by flashy promotions alone, but by execution quality, reliability near post time, and fast settlements once races are decided. Platforms built for fast markets — like Dexsport — reflect this shift toward efficiency-first betting. By understanding how racing markets work, choosing the right platform, and avoiding structural weak points, bettors can navigate horse racing crypto betting sites with greater confidence and control.",More News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|MARKET|MINING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Daily', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptodaily,2026-01-24 11:25:01

The flagship cryptocurrency, which looked set for a return to six-figure valuation barely over a week ago, now seems to have lost all its bullish momentum. Broadly speaking, these recent struggles put to rest questions around the “relief rallies” to the upside, and correlate more with the current bear market structure. However, the latest on-chain evaluation shows that the Bitcoin price woes could worsen from here on out. Expert Explains Why $60,000 Is Possible For BTC Price In a recent post on the X platform, Alphractal CEO and founder Joao Wedson said that the Bitcoin price could still have room to fall below the $60,000 level. This not-so-optimistic prediction is based on the number of days Bitcoin has traded at prices higher than today. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply In Profit Stalls At 71%: Still Not Enough For A Sustainable Recovery According to Wedson, there have been 355 days when the Bitcoin price has traded at levels higher than today. This figure was derived from the “Days Spent at a Profit” metric, which tracks the number of days in Bitcoin’s history where the market price was higher than the current price. This indicator measures how much price action — in the past — has occurred above the current price level. From a historical standpoint, an increase in the number of “Days Spent at a Profit” tends to occur during bear cycles or extended periods of sideways movement, implying that different investor groups are holding BTC at a price higher than their cost bases. As Wedson highlighted, the “Days Spent at a Profit” metric reached around 775 days as the Bitcoin price approached a bottom. Going by this historical context, the current level of this indicator (355 days) suggests that the flagship cryptocurrency is still a distance away from extreme levels often associated with bearish market bottoms. Ultimately, this deduction means that the price of Bitcoin could still be at risk of an extended decline over the next 300 days. According to the Alphractal, this extended period of price decline could see BTC revisit $60,000, potentially triggering significant liquidations among retail investors and institutional players who entered the market post-ETF. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $89,900, reflecting no significant change in the past 24 hours. However, the market leader is currently down by over 5% on the weekly timeframe, while nearly 30% adrift its all-time high of $126,080. Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Revisit $97,600?

Here’s What It Means,https://timestabloid.com/more-traders-are-betting-against-xrp-on-binance-heres-what-it-means/,"XRP’s funding rates on Binance have turned negative, indicating that more traders are currently betting against the asset. This development points to a market setup that could trigger significant short-term movements if buying pressure increases. Crypto commentator Xaif (@XaifCrypto) drew attention to this trend with a chart showing the funding rates alongside XRP’s USD price. XRP funding rates on Binance are negative. That means more traders are betting against XRP (shorts). When too many people short, even a small move up can force them to close. This often leads to a bounce or short squeeze. Keep an eye on it. $XRP pic.twitter.com/GsHJeWZENI — Xaif Crypto| (@Xaif_Crypto) January 22, 2026 XRP’s Negative Funding Rates The chart shows periods where funding rates dip below zero, signaling that short positions dominate the market. Xaif noted, “That means more traders are betting against XRP (shorts).” Negative funding rates suggest that traders who hold long positions receive payments from short sellers, reflecting the cost of borrowing XRP to maintain short positions. The chart shows multiple clusters of negative funding rates over the last several months. These areas, particularly those in mid-2025 and late 2025 into early 2026, demonstrate heightened short-term activity. Historically, when short positions accumulate to this degree, even modest upward price movements can force traders to close their positions, creating a rapid price rebound . XRP Price Response to Market Pressure The chart links funding rate trends with XRP’s price movements. While XRP sometimes showed consolidation, spikes in funding rate activity correspond with notable price surges. XRP showed this activity in late 2024 before the 500% rally and in mid-2025 before its run to a new all-time high . When the market faces an excess of shorts, any buying pressure can accelerate upward price movements. Xaif emphasized this dynamic, noting, “When too many people short, even a small move up can force them to close. This often leads to a bounce or short squeeze.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Short Squeeze Potential The current negative funding rates suggest that XRP could be positioned for that short squeeze . Traders holding short positions may be vulnerable if buying momentum increases. A short squeeze occurs when traders are compelled to buy back the asset to cover their positions, amplifying price growth in the process. This makes monitoring funding rates crucial for understanding potential market behavior. XRP’s funding rates, combined with its price trends, indicate a market environment in which positioning imbalances could trigger significant movements. Observing these patterns provides insight into potential price acceleration points. Traders who track funding rate changes can gain an advantage in anticipating market responses, particularly during periods of concentrated short activity.

While price action remains compressed, a series of institutional and regulatory developments this week is reshaping how the market views Bitcoin’s longer-term role. South Korea’s $48M Bitcoin Custody Breach Raises Alarms South Korean authorities are investigating the disappearance of roughly 70 bn won ($48 mn) worth of seized Bitcoin from official custody. The issue surfaced during a routine audit by the Gwangju District Prosecutors’ Office, according to local reports. Preliminary findings suggest the loss resulted from a phishing attack, after a staff member reportedly accessed a fake website, leading to leaked credentials. While details remain limited due to the ongoing investigation, the case has reignited debate around how governments store and protect confiscated digital assets. South Korean prosecutors investigate disappearance of seized Bitcoin following phishing attack Multiple Bitcoins went missing in mid-2025 after private key credentials were exposed in a phishing attack, resulting in irreversible transfers — crypto.news (@cryptodotnews) January 23, 2026 Importantly, the incident does not reflect a failure of the Bitcoin network itself. Instead, it underscores weaknesses in human processes and custody frameworks. Long term, this type of breach may push governments toward stricter crypto custody standards, ironically strengthening institutional confidence rather than weakening it. You can't make this up.

According to Bloomberg, the bank is assessing third-party partners to support the rollout. UBS plans to make cryptocurrency investing available for some private banking clients in what could become a significant move into digital assets for the wealth manager https://t.co/pWi6Inm9AP — Bloomberg (@business) January 23, 2026 If successful, UBS could later expand the service into the US and Asia-Pacific, aligning with similar initiatives from Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan. The move reflects growing demand among high-net-worth investors for crypto exposure through trusted, regulated institutions, rather than exchanges alone. Bitwise’s Bitcoin-Gold ETF Signals Macro Thinking Adding to the institutional theme, Bitwise Asset Management has launched the Bitwise Proficio Currency Debasement ETF (BPRO) on the NYSE. Unlike spot Bitcoin ETFs, BPRO is actively managed and blends Bitcoin, gold, precious metals, and mining equities, with at least 25% allocated to gold at all times. The fund carries a 0.96% expense ratio and targets long-term investors focused on capital preservation. By pairing Bitcoin with gold, Bitwise frames BTC as a macro hedge against currency debasement, not a speculative trade. Bitcoin Price Forecast: $89,500 Range Tightens as Breakout Pressure Builds Bitcoin is trading near $89,500, holding inside a narrowing range after a sharp rejection from the $97,000 peak earlier this month. On the 2-hour chart, price action points to compression rather than breakdown. BTC continues to defend the $87,300–$88,000 support band, an area repeatedly tested and protected by buyers. Long lower candlestick wicks around this zone suggest sellers are struggling to gain follow-through, signaling thinning supply at lower levels. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview From a structural view, Bitcoin remains anchored to a rising trendline that has guided price higher since the $83,800 low. While price briefly slipped below the 50-EMA and 100-EMA, it has stabilized near the 200-EMA, which is flattening instead of rolling over. This behavior typically reflects a transition phase, not a confirmed trend reversal. The broader setup resembles a descending flag within an ascending channel, a formation that often resolves in the direction of the prevailing trend. Momentum supports this outlook. RSI has rebounded from oversold levels near 30 and is now hovering around 48–50, signaling balance rather than renewed selling pressure. Recent candles show smaller bodies and reduced volatility, often seen before range expansion. If BTC dips, $87,400 remains key support. A push above $90,980 would open the path toward $92,400 and $94,250. Trade setup: Buy near $88,000–$87,500, target $94,000, stop below $85,500. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of BTC on Solana? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the BTC ecosystem. While BTC remains the gold standard for security, Bitcoin Hyper adds what it always lacked: Solana-level speed.

The move to active engineering comes as the blockchain industry confronts accelerating timelines for quantum computing threats. The non-profit organization behind the Ethereum blockchain has announced the formation of a dedicated Post Quantum (PQ) team, led by Thomas Coratger, with support from Emile, a cryptographer behind the leanVM project that forms the cryptographic cornerstone of Ethereum’s quantum defense strategy. This is coming just a few days after Coinbase established an independent advisory board on quantum computing, which includes Ethereum researcher Justin Drake, who made the announcement of the latest EF Post Quantum team. Drake wrote on X , “Today marks an inflection in the Ethereum Foundation’s long-term quantum strategy.” He stated, “Our journey began in 2019, with the “Eth3.0 Quantum Security” presentation at StarkWare Sessions. Since 2024, PQ has been central to the @leanEthereum vision. The pace of PQ engineering breakthroughs since then has been nothing short of phenomenal,” adding that after years of preparatory work, “timelines are accelerating. Time to go full PQ.” What threats await the crypto space with quantum computing? There is growing concern that quantum computers could eventually crack the elliptic curve cryptography, which most blockchain networks operate on, and this could potentially expose wallet keys and compromise billions of pounds in digital assets. While expert estimates vary widely on when such threats might materialize, ranging from as soon as 2028 to several decades away, the consensus is building that preparation cannot wait. Industry experts estimate a five to fifteen-year timeline before quantum computers could potentially break current cryptographic standards, according to research from Chainalysis . The challenge is compounded by “harvest now, decrypt later” scenarios, where adversaries could collect and store cryptographic data today to crack it once quantum computing advances enough to do that. How is the Ethereum Foundation preparing for the post-quantum phase? The EF is placing substantial resources behind its quantum resistance efforts. Drake wrote, “Today we are announcing a $1M Poseidon Prize to harden the Poseidon hash function. We are betting big on hash-based cryptography to enjoy the strongest and leanest cryptographic foundations.” He also mentioned that the prize complements another $1 million initiative called the Proximity Prize, calling on the community to check it out as well. Previously, the foundation awarded $12 million to STARKware for work on Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent Arguments of Knowledge (zk-STARKS), which are central to the post-quantum strategy alongside hash-based cryptography. Multi-client post-quantum consensus devnets are already operational, with participation from established teams. The coordination for that section is being managed by Will Corcoran through the weekly PQ interop calls. Antonio Sanso, a researcher at Ethereum, will lead bi-weekly All Core Devs breakout calls beginning next month to coordinate development of post-quantum transaction signatures and account abstraction features. The foundation is also leveraging artificial intelligence for cryptographic verification, with Drake noting that Alexander Hicks, who works with the EF, ran a specialized maths AI for eight hours at a $200 cost. Drake stated that the AI “one-shotted a formal proof one of the hardest lemmas in the foundations of hash-based snarks.” According to Drake, the feat is mind-blowing, and applied cryptography will never be the same as a result. A comprehensive roadmap targeting “zero loss of funds and zero downtime” during the transition will be published on pq.ethereum.org, though specific timelines remain under wraps. The foundation plans workshops with a PQ day scheduled to be held in Cannes on March 29, 2026. Drake also mentioned that the EF will be hosting a 3-day PQ event in October, and it will be attended by top experts. There is also a six-part educational video series on Ethereum’s PQ strategy that will be released by the ZKPodcast, and materials for enterprises and nation-states are being prepared by the foundation’s Enterprise Acceleration team.

The Next Move Won’t Be Small,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-is-coiling-like-a-spring-the-next-move-wont-be-small/,"XRP has entered a decisive phase where price compression often precedes expansion . After a sharp rejection from recent highs, volatility has tightened, and the market now trades in a narrow range that reflects hesitation rather than stability. Such periods rarely persist for long, especially after strong directional moves, making the current structure one of the most important setups in recent weeks. This technical situation gained attention following an analysis shared by Xaif on X, which examined XRP’s 4-hour chart and highlighted a developing volatility coil . The post arrived as XRP struggled to reclaim lost ground, refocusing trader attention on key technical levels that could determine the next major move. Tight Consolidation After a Sharp Decline XRP pulled back aggressively from the $2.00 region and then transitioned into tight sideways movement. Price now oscillates between approximately $1.92 and $1.96, signaling a pause where buyers and sellers continue to test each other’s resolve. This behavior often reflects indecision, but it also signals that the market prepares for resolution rather than continuation of drift. $XRP is coiling like a spring the next move won’t be small. Price is compressing right at the Tenkan–Kijun zone after a sharp drop. This circled area shows tight consolidation usually where the next move gets decided. A clean break above 1.95–1.96 opens room for a relief push. https://t.co/b7ddNsb4tX pic.twitter.com/yCrvW0DKyB — Xaif Crypto| (@Xaif_Crypto) January 23, 2026 According to CoinMarketCap data, XRP currently trades near $1.91 as of report time, posting a modest 0.41% gain over the past 24 hours. Despite this uptick, price has not escaped the consolidation range , keeping volatility compressed. Ichimoku Signals a Volatility Coil Xaif’s analysis focuses on XRP compressing directly around the Ichimoku Tenkan-Sen and Kijun-Sen lines on the 4-hour timeframe. These levels often act as short-term balance zones where momentum resets. When price clusters tightly around both lines after a strong move, it typically signals stored energy rather than exhaustion. Historical Ichimoku backtests show that similar consolidation patterns frequently precede 5% to 10% directional moves once price breaks the structure. This statistical tendency adds weight to the current setup and explains why traders closely monitor this zone. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Levels That Will Define Direction XRP remains technically bearish while it trades below the broader downtrend line. A clean 4-hour close above the $1.95–$1.96 resistance zone would mark a short-term shift in momentum and open room for a relief rally. Such a breakout would likely attract momentum traders looking for continuation toward higher resistance levels. On the downside, strong support sits between $1.88 and $1.90. A decisive loss of that range would invalidate the consolidation thesis and expose XRP to renewed selling pressure, especially if overall market sentiment weakens. A Move Is Building, Not Fading XRP continues to compress rather than trend, a condition that historically resolves with force. While direction remains undecided, the structure suggests that the next move will arrive with speed and size. As volatility tightens further, the market approaches a point where patience gives way to momentum. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The individual in question, Sen Hok Ling, is a Malaysian international and a known ally of the incarcerated Qian. According to the United Kingdom’s CPS, Ling is a professional money launderer who received 83.7 BTC from Qian between February and April 2024. He cashed out the Bitcoin stash in the United Arab Emirates, sending the funds to accounts based in the country and through other third-party platforms where he converted it into cash. “Ling took part in a sophisticated money laundering operation which laundered many millions of pounds from the proceeds of crime,” said Adrian Foster, Chief Crown Prosecutor of the Crown Prosecution Service Proceeds of Crime Division, in a statement. United Kingdom’s CPS orders money launderer to return stolen funds Ling was sentenced to four years and 11 months in prison last November after pleading guilty to a one-count charge of money laundering in relation to the offence. He was sentenced alongside Qian, identified as Yadi Zhang, who received 11 years and eight months following a guilty plea for two counts of money laundering offences. Prosecutors are now asking Ling to return $7.6 million from the funds that he laundered while the operation was still active. ⚖️ @CPSUK with @metpoliceuk obtained multi-million-pound Confiscation Order against convicted money launderer Seng Hok Ling https://t.co/8qveSYwPr0 pic.twitter.com/83o8LWOcDY — Crown Prosecution Service (@CPSUK) January 22, 2026 According to previous reports, Qian ran a Ponzi scheme in China between 2014 and 2017. She used a company called Lantian Gerui, mostly targeting elderly Chinese investors. The scheme was able to con more than 128,000 out of their pensions and life savings, with most of them lured under the promise of elaborate returns. The fraudsters also held big banquets and roadshows, inviting the son-in-law of Chairman Mao to an event at one point. United Kingdom Prosecutors claimed that payouts stopped in 2017, and Qian was able to convert some of her ill-gotten funds into crypto and fled the country. They claimed that she arrived in the United Kingdom with a passport under the name Yadi Zhang and set about reinventing herself. She tried to cash out the Bitcoin to purchase high-end properties in London, but was unable to do so due to know-your-customer requirements. Instead, she settled for a $21,000-a-month mansion in Hampstead Heath, London. Seized Bitcoin stash still a subject of debate After she arrived in the United Kingdom, her diary showed that she plotted to rub shoulders with European aristocracy, jotting down hopes to purchase a Swedish castle, becoming friends with a duke, and acquiring a British bank. Qian also thought about becoming Queen of Liberaland, referring to an unrecognized microstate in the Danube River where Tron founder Justin Sun is the prime minister. However, her thoughts were cut short when she was arrested in York in April 2024. United Kingdom authorities carried out a raid on her Hampstead mansion and discovered 61,000 BTC, the largest crypto seizure in the history of the United Kingdom. The seized digital asset, which is currently worth $5.4 billion, remains the subject of debate. Investors in Lantian Gerui did not pay in crypto and are estimated to have lost a combined $600 million, a fraction of the total worth of the Bitcoin seized from her. Meanwhile, civil proceedings are still ongoing to decide how the Bitcoin will be disbursed. While victims will eventually be reimbursed, the additional funds may end up in the United Kingdom Treasury. Nico Harris, CEO at digital assets recovery firm CryptoCare, mentioned that the UK’s Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 empowers authorities to seize funds from fraud even if it originates overseas. “The law allows the UK to retain such funds, typically directing them to the Treasury or law enforcement,” he said. Harris has suggested that the United Kingdom establish a strategic reserve with the funds. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Our ENA price prediction expects a maximum of $0.82 in 2026. In 2032, we expect the ENA price to achieve $7.38. Ethena is a stablecoin project built on Ethereum that offers USDe, a fully decentralized coin pegged to the US dollar. Unlike stablecoins such as USDC or USDT, USDe doesn’t depend on banks or centralized companies for reserves. Instead, it uses a cash-and-carry trading strategy to keep its value equal to the dollar. For investors who prioritize decentralization, USDe could be an appealing choice — especially since it currently offers staking rewards above 9%. However, critics caution that since the project is still new, it’s uncertain whether USDe’s high yields and dollar peg can remain stable during a market downturn. Based on these developments, we’ve compiled our Ethena price prediction from 2026-2032. In this article, we’ll find out “Will ENA reach $10?” and explore the factors behind ENA price prediction.

However, if the ENA price successfully breaks above $0.1947, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $0.2244. ENA/USDT Chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, ENA price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.1703, resulting in a correction to $0.1495. Is ENA a good investment? Whether ENA is a good investment depends on your goals and how much risk you’re comfortable with. Ethena has been ranked among the 100 cryptocurrencies. Still, there are questions about its demand, given its similarity to algorithmic stablecoins — a concept that lost trust after LUNA’s collapse in 2022. Even so, Ethena has shown strong performance during market surges, making it a solid project in the crypto market. If you believe in the project’s future and don’t mind the ups and downs, it might be worth putting in a small amount. Why is the ENA price down today? ENA’s price gained selling pressure around recent highs, resulting in a minor downward push. This created a push toward $0.175. Will Ethena price recover? If buyers hold above the $0.25 level, we might see a comeback in buying demand. Will ENA reach $10? ENA price might reach the $10 mark in 2035 if buying demand surges and ENA attracts altcoin investors. Will ENA reach $100? The $100 mark is a distant dream for ENA. This price level is achievable in the long run if ENA continues to expand its offerings and attract buying demand. Is Ethena a good long-term investment? ENA has gained popularity due to strong community support. However, conducting thorough research into their long-term potential is crucial to determine if they represent a viable long-term investment.

ENA historical price sentiment ENA Price History: Coinmarketcap Ethena’s price history from mid-2024 to late 2025 shows a period of intense volatility marked by sharp fluctuations in both price and market capitalization. In early 2024, Ethena traded strongly, reaching highs around $1.20 in April, supported by high trading volumes exceeding $8 billion. However, by mid-2024, the token began to decline steadily, closing near $0.38 by July as investor sentiment weakened and market activity cooled. The latter half of 2024 saw further instability. Ethena’s price dropped as low as $0.20 in September, reflecting a major correction phase in the broader crypto market. Despite these setbacks, the token demonstrated resilience, climbing back above $1.00 by December 2024. This late-year rally suggested renewed interest from traders and potential ecosystem developments. In 2025, Ethena continued to experience wide swings. The token opened the year near $1.25 but faced sustained downward pressure through the spring, dipping below $0.30 by June. A strong recovery followed in the third quarter, with prices surpassing $0.70 in August and stabilizing near $0.50 by October. Throughout this period, Ethena’s market cap ranged from $1 billion to over $5 billion. In early November, the price of ENA declined toward $0.3. By the end of November, ENA declined below $0.23. ENA ended December on a bearish note by trading around $0.2.",Crypto Price Predictions|ENA|Ethena,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|ENA|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-24 12:14:57

Solana (SOL), often discussed alongside Ethereum in debates about network performance and user activity, remains a focal point for traders and longer-term holders. While near-term volatility persists, forward-looking expectations suggest a bullish move for early 2026. SOL currently trades at $128.27, down 1.11% from the previous day. The token has demonstrated resilience in the face of recent market pullbacks, consolidating alongside other major assets . However, it remains well below prior cycle highs. Against this backdrop, we asked ChatGPT for a direct price outlook for Solana on February 1, 2026. The AI chatbot gave a detailed response, focused on cycle timing, market structure, and Solana’s positioning within the wider digital asset ecosystem. ChatGPT’s Price Prediction for Solana (SOL) The AI’s response set a base-case target of $165, a likely range between $140 and $210. In its assessment, ChatGPT stated that “SOL above $150 by Feb 1, 2026 feels more likely than not,” positioning $165 as “a fair midpoint.” These figures place Solana meaningfully above its current price, while stopping short of calling for an extreme upside scenario . Key Factors Supporting the Solana (SOL) Forecast The rationale behind the projection centers on several factors. First is cycle timing. According to the AI, early 2026 still falls within the post-halving expansion phase, a period when altcoins have historically attracted capital. This context supports expectations for continued participation in assets like SOL. Second, the forecast emphasizes Solana’s functional role in the market. The AI notes that Solana has established itself as a high-throughput network supporting consumer-focused crypto activity, including payments, decentralized finance, and high-volume trading segments. That positioning underpins the assumption that network usage and visibility will remain strong in 2026. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Scenario-Based Price Targets ChatGPT further refined its price targets. In a bearish case, ChatGPT places SOL near $140, assuming a sideways market and sustained Bitcoin dominance . The base case of around $165 reflects a balanced environment where altcoin participation improves without reaching speculative excess. In a bullish scenario, the AI sees $210 or higher as achievable if capital rotation accelerates and a broader altcoin rally takes hold. ChatGPT is bullish on Solana, expecting it to rise before the start of February. If the asset can build enough momentum, it could kickstart a run toward a new all-time high .

Farcaster’s co-founder, Dan Romero, said the platform remains operational, noting that it has over 100,000 funded wallets and had 250,000 active monthly users in December. Meanwhile, Romero clarified that the news about Farcaster shutting down was just a rumor. He pointed out that the acquirer, venture-backed startup Neynar, plans to shift the company to a more developer-focused direction. Merkle Manufactory, the company behind Farcaster , started raising the $180 million it is refunding to investors in July 2022, when it received $30 million from venture capital a16z crypto. In March 2024, the company held another Paradigm-led funding round, reportedly pushing its valuation above $1 billion. Romero says the decision is five years in the making According to the Merkle co-founder, the decision to return the $180 million follows five years of development efforts and an attempt to steward investor capital responsibly. He mentioned that Merkle has raised the entire $180 million over its lifetime. Romero’s remarks prompted a response from Farcaster investor Balaji Srivasan, who confirmed that investors were receiving their funds back. Srinivasan also expressed his satisfaction over how the Farcaster team is working on the decentralized social infrastructure. Antonio Martínez, another Farcaster and Neynar investor, also backed Romero’s post on X. The early Farcaster user called the shutdown claims complete bullshit and defended Farcaster’s initial objective of establishing a permissionless social network where users control their own data. However, other Farcaster users following the conversation are unconvinced about the decision to refund the $180 million, among other issues recently plaguing the company. Specifically, they are questioning how a firm that raised $150 million in 2024 could sell to a firm that raised far less. Meanwhile, a Farcaster builder believes the company’s problems stem from its leadership and limited community input. The builder stresses that Neynar’s takeover only works if incentives and governance become more open, while other users and developers point to the difficulty of building social networks at scale. For now, the debate remains split among the crypto audience. Some see the investor refund as a rare and orderly outcome, while others view it as a very expensive experiment that falls short of expectations. Farcaster generated $2.8M in revenue over five years Farcaster’s revenue has failed to keep pace with costs, and estimates show that the company has generated approximately $2.8 million in revenue over five years despite raising $180 million. Even the Clanker acquisition, a company generating more than $50 million in fees, failed to reverse the trend. Meanwhile, Farcaster’s future now depends on whether the builder-focused model can succeed where a social network approach failed. On the other hand, Akshat Vaidya, the co-founder and managing partner at Maelstrom, believes that scaling DeFi social is brutal. “Tokens and onchain ownership are nice features, but they don’t solve the chicken-egg problem: nobody posts daily where their audience isn’t already living.” – Akshat Vaidya , Co-founder and managing partner at Maelstrom Notably, several efforts to improve the Farcaster social network failed to work out as planned until the latest Neynar acquisition was announced. Many crypto users are reportedly monitoring developments around the decentralized social project to understand what is actually happening. Lia Savillo, the head of socials at Hype, also observes that on-chain social is not dying. She noted that the next era of on-chain social platforms will be built by teams that prioritize sustainability, infra, and UX over ideology. Savillo adds that the recent moves, including the developments with Farcaster, feel like a healthy correction. According to Savillo, early on-chain socials were driven by ideals and culture. Still, now she emphasizes that long-term viability requires operators who treat it like infrastructure, not a movement. Savillo adds that these changes across decentralized social suggest that the space is growing and shifting from founder-led experimentation to teams optimized for developer speed, reliability, and scale.

According to analysts looking at the 2-year window, 3 assets can be seen as having long-term potential, albeit due to entirely different reasons. Two of them are the firmly established foundation of the market, and the third one is a new cheap altcoin that has not reached its initial wave of usage yet. Bitcoin (BTC) The digital asset market is still anchored on Bitcoin BTC. It is trading around $89K at a market cap of about $1.78T. Bitcoin remains the primary store of value in crypto portfolios, and most institutional funds bench on BTC to position long-term. This notwithstanding its power, chart analysts indicate resistance in the range of $92K to $98K. BTC has previously tried these sectors and failed to make a break unless there is fresh demand. Having reached its valuation of some trillion dollars, analysts anticipate that the company will grow at a slower rate in 2026 and 2027. Other price estimates reveal that Bitcoin will gain by a moderate 20% to 40% in the same year. That represents a lower return profile as compared to the previous cycles. Investors who want to get a greater upside are now combining BTC with smaller assets which are yet to be fully priced. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum ETH is used differently. It is trading at approximately $2,900 and its market cap is almost $350B. Ether leads the smart contract market, and is the primary settlement layer of the DeFi and token issuance. Adoption is still ongoing in staking, tokenization as well as rollup ecosystems. This is also true of ETH which experiences resistance at around $3,200 and at around 3,450. The breakouts are not as dramatic and slow due to the depth of liquidity. A number of 2026- 2027 Ethereum forecasts demonstrate moderate growth unless novel fee cycles or substantial institutional demand comes. ETH has remained a core position by many long-term investors. Nevertheless, the hunt of greater multiples has shifted the focus on what crypto to purchase beyond the large-cap cluster. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is that new crypto type of category. It is creating a lending protocol, with collateral conditions, borrowing machinery and two live markets. One market consumes liquidity pools that provide lenders with assets and receive APY in the form of mtTokens. The other permits direct matching in loan-to-value conditions like 35% or 75%. At the start of the early distribution phase in 2025, Mutuum Finance was trading at $0.01. During Phase 7, the token is currently at $0.04. It has raised a total of $19.9M, 18,900 holders are registered and 830M tokens sold. Out of the 4B supply, 1.82B or 45.5% are early access. The participants in Phase 1 will be aligned to 500% appreciation at the pricing point at the launching official price of $0.06. The official X account of the team states that V1 protocol will be released in the Sepolia testnet in Q1 2026. Utility Mechanics and Price Modeling Analysts who monitor DeFi crypto assets indicate that the token model of Mutuum Finance is outstanding due to its connection with the usage. Part of the revenue transfers to lenders via mtTokens when borrowers pay interest. The other portion is to buy MUTM in the open market. Bought tokens are recast to the stakers of the safety module of the mtTokens. This is referred to as a buy and distribute model. Analysts believe this equates token demand to the activity of borrowing as opposed to the attention cycles. The reliability of pricing is based on correct collateral information. Mutuum Finance is a decentralized finance company where oracles are utilized to provide data to the liquidation engine. This reduces undesirable instances of liquidation in high volatility, as well as securing lenders. Within a price model based on utility, a number of analysts project MUTM to be within the $0.18 to $0.24 price range in 2027. With the current level of $0.04, it would mean an increase of 350%-500% with the conditions of healthy borrowing. Stablecoin and Layer-2 Growth An overcollateralized stablecoin is also part of the roadmap. Individuals will be able to mint a stablecoin without the necessity to sell assets. Borrowers of stablecoins are more likely to remain longer in lending ecosystems to amplify earnings predictability and result in several times greater APY to residents. Expansion of the layers (layer 2) will also be done. Layers-2 access has the potential to cut fees and enhance user experience on smaller portfolios. According to analysts, the two features widen addressable demand and enhance user retention after the protocol is active. Bitcoin’s and Ethereum’s scale restricts the potential through 2026 and 2027. Mutuum Finance comes into the picture as a future crypto competitor since it is at the first toe of its utility window. Assuming its usage form and revenue logic is realized, analysts believe that MUTM may be among the best crypto opportunities to appreciate over the next several years, with some estimating 900% upside in constructive bullish scenarios.

57435810,658882,1769257829,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57435810.jpeg,Bitcoin Approaches Key Monthly Close — Here Are 3 Likely Scenarios,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-monthly-close-here-three-likely-scenarios/,"In the last week, Bitcoin suffered another correction wave with prices dropping to around $88,000 as the crypto market continues to face a weak investor appetite. While the premier cryptocurrency has experienced some slight relief, an approaching monthly close indicates the market is at a critical juncture that could define its price direction for February. Bitcoin Market Weighs Rebalance Or Complete Breakdown According to seasoned analyst KillaXBT , Bitcoin is heading into a pivotal monthly close next week, as recent price action suggests the market is approaching an inflection point. Notably, after sweeping external highs near $94,600 earlier in the month, BTC has since faced firm rejection, pushing price back toward the lower end of its recent range between $88,000-$90,000. The rejection from these highs resulted in pronounced upper wicks on higher timeframes, a structure that often signals aggressive selling pressure. However, KillaXBT explains that such wicks are frequently partially or fully retraced, due to liquidity. With a full trading week still remaining before the monthly candle closes, the market analyst postulates that there are three primary scenarios that could determine price direction for February. Firstly, Bitcoin could rise into the end of the month, allowing for a stronger monthly close. Under this scenario, February could begin with price forming the upper portion of the current wick, potentially revisiting the low-to-mid $90,000s before rolling over later in the month toward the $83,800 region. In the second scenario, Bitcoin closes the month near current levels around $89,000, followed by an early-February move to hunt liquidity in the $91,000–$92,000 range before resuming a downward trend. Interestingly, both scenarios align with the idea that the market may first move higher to rebalance liquidity before resolving lower. The third scenario presents a more severe outcome that aligns with a potential market breakdown. In this case, KillaXBT forecasts Bitcoin could retrace below the weekly and monthly open at $87,664 and close beneath this level before February. The analyst describes this scenario as “violently bearish”, as it increases the probability of a rapid move towards a lower support in the new month. Notably, KillaXBT favors the first two scenarios, as the present sentiment being heavily bearish indicates that most investors are least expecting a move to the higher side. However, the analyst also emphasizes that the loss of $83,800 support in any scenario would significantly alter the outlook for any remaining long exposure.

57434750,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=901365,1769258139,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/57434750.jpeg,Arthur Hayes predicts Bitcoin boost as Federal Reserve mulls yen support,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/dollar-printing-to-support-yen-may-boost-btc/,"Arthur Hayes, co-founder of cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX, has sparked fresh debate in financial markets by suggesting that potential US Federal Reserve intervention to support the weakening Japanese yen could spark a major rally in Bitcoin (BTC). Hayes says that if such support involves increased US dollar liquidity — effectively “printing money” — it may fuel a significant surge in Bitcoin’s price . His remarks come amid growing expectations that Japanese authorities may intervene in currency markets to shore up the yen, after a string of sharp moves in the dollar-yen exchange rate recently raised speculation of intervention. Traders have interpreted large one-day gains in the yen as a sign that central banks could be readying to take action. Some traders have also said the New York Fed has reached out to large banks to gauge market conditions in the yen market, fueling rumors that US monetary authorities are considering possible intervention. Hayes explained in a write-up on the social networking site X that if the Federal Reserve responded by creating bank reserves—often referred to by critics as “printing dollars”—and then proceeds from these reserves to sell the dollars for yen, this would expand market liquidity worldwide. To him, they might be placed on the Fed’s weekly balance sheet as part of foreign-currency-denominated assets. Analysts raise concerns regarding the fate of the dollar On Friday, January 23, reports indicated that the yen posted its biggest single-day gain against the dollar since August after officials from the United States and Japan signaled they are ready to intervene to stop the yen’s decline. Later that day, the New York Fed reached out to potential trading partners, as instructed by the Treasury Department, to review exchange rates. In response to this announcement, several individuals expressed mixed reactions, sparking a heated debate. In attempts to address this controversy, sources noted that the Fed was inquiring about current rates, particularly for the dollar/yen pair, if potential trading partners decided to trade dollars and yen in the currency markets. It is worth noting that the New York Fed executes transactions on behalf of the Treasury. Meanwhile, reports unveiled that a rate check typically indicates that authorities are anxious regarding currency stability and, therefore, could trigger immediate intervention. On the other hand, financial reports dated January 23 noted that the dollar declined by 1.7% compared to the yen. This situation intensified when these reports confirmed that the dollar weakened against other Asian currencies, including the Taiwanese dollar and the South Korean won. The unexpected result followed a volatile week in the US and Japan financial markets, highlighting gaps in current policy frameworks on both sides of the ocean. Investors expressed worries about increased government borrowing Earlier, US Treasury bond yields soared amid a selloff that several traders anticipated was driven by concerns about US President Donald Trump’s intentions regarding Greenland . However, this was not the case for Scott Bessent, the United States Secretary of the Treasury. According to him, this situation stemmed from the impact of surging yields on Japanese government bonds. Following Bessent’s claim, sources reported that long-term Japanese government bonds declined sharply as investors raised concerns about increased government borrowing amid a surprise election scheduled for February 8 this year. In the meantime, the Prime Minister of Japan, Sanae Takaichi, who just assumed her role in October, alleged that she requested the election to strengthen her coalition government’s hold on power. After conducting research, analysts found that the main reason for the sudden decline in bond prices was Takaichi’s pledge to suspend taxes on the sale of groceries for 2 years during the election.

This strategic initiative, reported by CoinDesk in early 2025, targets high-value assets like private credit and trade finance. Consequently, it signals a significant maturation of on-chain financial infrastructure for major investors. R3 Solana Yields: Bridging Enterprise and High-Performance Blockchain Enterprise blockchain consortium R3 will leverage Solana’s architecture to generate yields for institutional clients. This development marks a pivotal convergence of traditional finance’s demand for reliable returns with blockchain’s efficiency. R3’s co-founder, Todd McDonald, explicitly endorsed Solana’s technical merits for this role. He cited its high throughput, transaction-focused design, and scalable architecture as critical advantages. Furthermore, this partnership represents a calculated shift. R3, known for its Corda platform tailored for financial institutions, is now integrating with a public, high-speed blockchain. This integration suggests a growing institutional comfort with public ledger technology for specific, high-value use cases. The targeted assets—private credit and trade finance—are traditionally opaque and illiquid markets. Therefore, bringing them on-chain promises enhanced transparency and settlement speed. The Institutional Drive for On-Chain Yield The global search for yield has intensified in the current macroeconomic climate. Institutional portfolios increasingly require diversified, non-correlated assets. On-chain yield products, particularly those backed by real-world assets (RWA), have emerged as a compelling solution. R3’s initiative directly taps into this trend by focusing on private credit and trade finance. These sectors represent multi-trillion dollar markets traditionally inaccessible to most investors. Why Solana? A Technical and Strategic Rationale R3’s selection of Solana is not arbitrary. It follows a period of extensive network stability and developer growth. McDonald’s statement underscores a technical evaluation. Solana’s architecture enables thousands of transactions per second at low cost. This capability is essential for institutional-scale operations involving complex financial instruments. Moreover, its single global state simplifies the auditing and compliance processes crucial for regulated entities. The table below contrasts key attributes relevant to institutional deployment: Attribute Relevance for Institutional Yields High Throughput Enables simultaneous processing of numerous, complex financial transactions. Low Transaction Cost Makes micro-transactions and frequent settlements economically viable. Fast Finality Provides near-instant settlement certainty, reducing counterparty risk. Robust Developer Ecosystem Ensures ongoing innovation and maintenance of financial primitives. Additionally, Solana’s focus on a single, streamlined chain reduces operational complexity compared to multi-chain or layer-2 solutions. This simplicity is a significant factor for risk-averse institutional technology teams. Impact and Future Trajectory for Blockchain Finance This announcement has immediate and long-term implications for the digital asset landscape. Primarily, it validates public blockchains as viable venues for structured, institutional-grade financial products. It also accelerates the convergence of decentralized finance (DeFi) mechanics with traditional finance (TradFi) compliance and security standards. The move could catalyze several key developments: Increased Capital Inflow: Major funds may allocate more to on-chain vehicles, seeing reputable firms like R3 building infrastructure. Regulatory Scrutiny and Clarity: As large-scale capital moves on-chain, regulatory frameworks will likely evolve more rapidly. Product Innovation: Other enterprise blockchain providers may pursue similar integrations, fostering competition. Market Legitimization: It strengthens the case for blockchain’s utility beyond speculation into core financial services. Ultimately, the success of this initiative will depend on execution. Key factors include the actual yield generated, the robustness of legal structures, and the seamless integration with existing institutional workflows. However, the strategic intent is clear: to build a seamless bridge for traditional capital to access the efficiency of blockchain networks. Conclusion The launch of R3 Solana yields represents a definitive step toward institutional maturity for blockchain technology. By targeting high-value private credit and trade finance markets, R3 is addressing a clear need for efficient, transparent yield generation. This partnership leverages Solana’s technical strengths to meet the rigorous demands of institutional investors. As a result, it sets a new benchmark for how enterprise and public blockchain ecosystems can collaborate to reshape global finance. FAQs Q1: What exactly is R3 launching on Solana? R3 is creating a platform to generate yields for institutional investors using the Solana blockchain. The platform will specifically focus on tokenizing and managing yield-bearing assets like private credit loans and trade finance agreements. Q2: Why did R3 choose Solana over other blockchains? R3 leadership cited Solana’s high transaction throughput, low costs, and transaction-focused architecture as key reasons. These features are essential for handling the volume and complexity of institutional financial products efficiently and at scale. Q3: What are the target assets for these yields? The primary targets are institutional-grade private credit and trade finance. These are lending and financing activities typically conducted between large corporations and financial institutions, representing massive but traditionally illiquid markets. Q4: How does this differ from regular DeFi yield farming? This initiative is institutionally focused, meaning it involves regulated entities, compliance with financial laws, and deals with large-ticket, real-world assets. It prioritizes security, legal structure, and integration with traditional finance systems over the permissionless, retail-focused nature of much DeFi yield farming. Q5: What does this mean for the future of institutional crypto adoption? This is a significant validation signal. It demonstrates that major enterprise blockchain firms see public networks like Solana as mature enough for critical financial infrastructure. It will likely encourage other traditional financial institutions to explore similar on-chain offerings for their clients.

57434734,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=265126,1769258711,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Stablecoin Interest Ban Sparks Fears of Devastating Capital Flight from US Markets,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/stablecoin-interest-ban-capital-flight/,"BitcoinWorld Stablecoin Interest Ban Sparks Fears of Devastating Capital Flight from US Markets WASHINGTON, D.C. — May 15, 2025 — A critical provision within the proposed U.S. Crypto-Asset Market Structure (CLARITY) Act is triggering alarm across financial markets. Experts now warn that a potential ban on interest payments for stablecoins could initiate a significant and damaging exodus of capital from regulated American markets. This regulatory move, intended to provide clarity, may instead push vast sums into opaque offshore financial systems and unregulated synthetic dollar products, fundamentally undermining U.S. competitiveness in the digital asset arena. Stablecoin Interest Ban: The Core of the CLARITY Act Controversy The CLARITY Act represents a landmark legislative effort to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets in the United States. However, its treatment of payment stablecoins has become a focal point of intense debate. A specific provision seeks to prohibit issuers of these dollar-pegged tokens from offering interest or yield to holders. Proponents argue this measure protects consumers from undisclosed risks and separates payment tools from investment products. Conversely, industry experts contend the policy is dangerously myopic. They assert it ignores the fundamental economic mechanics of modern digital finance. Consequently, this ban could create severe unintended consequences for market stability and national financial influence. Mechanics of Stablecoin Yield and Market Impact Stablecoins like USDC and USDT currently generate yield for issuers and, sometimes, for holders through a straightforward process. Issuers hold reserves primarily in ultra-safe, short-term assets such as Treasury bills. The interest earned on these multi-billion dollar reserve portfolios can then be shared. This model provides a low-risk return in the digital economy. A ban disrupts this economic incentive. It would effectively force capital to seek returns elsewhere. Colin Butler, Head of Markets at Mega Matrix, emphasizes this point. He states that such a rule would not eliminate demand for yield. Instead, it would simply redirect that demand toward less transparent and potentially riskier jurisdictions. This capital flight poses a direct threat to the depth and liquidity of regulated U.S. markets. The Looming Threat of Offshore Capital Flight The most immediate and concerning risk identified by analysts is the migration of capital to offshore financial centers. Jurisdictions with more permissive or ambiguous regulatory stances on digital assets stand to gain immensely. Colin Butler explicitly warns that funds might flow into opaque offshore financial markets. These markets often lack the robust consumer protections, transparency requirements, and anti-money laundering safeguards mandated in the United States. Therefore, a policy designed to reduce risk domestically could inadvertently increase systemic risk globally. It would also cede American oversight and auditing power over significant financial flows. The table below outlines the potential shift in capital destinations: Current Destination (Under US Regulation) Potential Offshore Alternative Key Risk Factor Interest-bearing USDC/USDT in regulated entities Non-interest bearing stablecoins in US wallets Loss of yield for US consumers and businesses Capital held in compliant US digital asset platforms Capital moved to exchanges in less-regulated jurisdictions Reduced investor protection and regulatory oversight Transparent reserve reporting to US authorities Opaque custody and reserve practices offshore Increased counterparty and solvency risk The Rise of Regulatory Arbitrage and Synthetic Dollars Beyond simple geographic flight, the proposed ban actively incentivizes financial innovation designed to circumvent the rules. Andrei Grachev, a founding partner at Falcon Finance, highlights this critical loophole. He suggests capital will inevitably shift to synthetic dollar products that exist outside the legal definition of a payment stablecoin. Grachev specifically cites Ethena’s USDe as a prime example. Products like USDe use complex derivatives strategies, often involving staked Ethereum and short futures positions, to maintain a soft peg to the US dollar while offering substantial yield. Because they do not claim to be backed by traditional cash and cash-equivalent reserves, they may evade the CLARITY Act’s strictures. This creates a two-tier system: heavily regulated, low-yield official stablecoins versus lightly regulated, high-yield synthetic alternatives . The latter operates in a significant regulatory gray area, attracting capital seeking returns that U.S. policy now forbids. Undermining US Competitiveness in Digital Finance The collective impact of capital flight and regulatory arbitrage strikes at the heart of U.S. financial leadership. For decades, the depth, safety, and rule-of-law in American markets have attracted global capital. The digital asset sector presented an opportunity to extend this leadership into the 21st century. However, experts argue that the stablecoin interest ban could achieve the opposite effect. Andrei Grachev contends that such a ban could ultimately undermine U.S. competitiveness. By pushing innovation and capital offshore, the U.S. would lose its ability to shape the standards and practices of the future monetary system. Other global financial hubs, including the UK, EU, Singapore, and the UAE, are advancing their own crypto frameworks. These frameworks often seek to attract business by balancing innovation with consumer protection. A restrictive U.S. stance could therefore cede ground to these competing jurisdictions at a pivotal moment in financial history. Loss of Market Share: U.S.-based crypto exchanges and service providers could see assets under management decline as users seek yield elsewhere. Erosion of Dollar Dominance: While synthetic dollars are pegged to USD, the ecosystems and trading pairs that develop around them may operate entirely outside the U.S. banking and regulatory perimeter. Stifling Domestic Innovation: Entrepreneurs and developers may choose to launch new financial products in more accommodating jurisdictions from the outset. Historical Context and the Path Forward This debate echoes historical financial regulatory challenges. Past attempts to overly restrict financial activities, such as certain offshore banking rules, have often led to sophisticated workarounds rather than elimination of the activity. The proposed stablecoin interest ban faces a similar dynamic. The underlying demand for efficient, yield-generating digital dollar instruments is robust and global. Policymakers now face a critical choice. They can either design a regulatory framework that safely accommodates this demand within the U.S. oversight regime, or they can enact rules that export the activity—and its associated risks—to shadows beyond their reach. The final version of the CLARITY Act, and its treatment of this issue, will signal the United States’ strategic approach to the next era of finance. Conclusion The proposed stablecoin interest ban within the CLARITY Act presents a significant policy dilemma. While aiming to protect consumers and define clear boundaries, it risks triggering substantial capital flight to offshore and synthetic dollar products. Experts like Colin Butler and Andrei Grachev warn that this outcome would not only fail to address underlying market desires for yield but could also actively harm U.S. financial competitiveness and global influence. The ultimate impact of this stablecoin interest ban will depend on whether legislators can balance necessary safeguards with the realities of a dynamic, global digital capital market. The stability of the future financial system may hinge on getting this balance right. FAQs Q1: What is the CLARITY Act and what does it propose for stablecoins? The Crypto-Asset Market Structure (CLARITY) Act is proposed U.S. legislation to create a regulatory framework for digital assets. A key provision would ban issuers of payment stablecoins from offering interest or yield to holders, classifying them strictly as payment tools rather than investment products. Q2: Why do experts believe a stablecoin interest ban would drive capital offshore? Capital naturally seeks return. If regulated U.S. stablecoins cannot offer yield, investors and institutions will move funds to jurisdictions or products that can. This includes offshore exchanges and synthetic dollar products that exist outside the proposed legal definitions, leading to capital flight from regulated markets. Q3: What are synthetic dollar products like Ethena’s USDe? Synthetic dollar products are crypto assets designed to track the value of the US dollar using complex derivatives strategies (like collateralized debt positions and futures contracts) rather than holding traditional cash reserves. They often offer high yields and may operate in regulatory gray areas not covered by stablecoin-specific laws. Q4: How could this affect the average cryptocurrency user in the United States? U.S. users may lose access to simple, low-risk yield options on their dollar-pegged crypto holdings. They may face pressure to use unfamiliar offshore platforms with less legal protection or to engage with more complex and risky synthetic assets to achieve similar returns. Q5: What is the main argument against the interest ban? The main argument is that it will not eliminate the demand for yield but will instead push the associated activity, capital, and innovation into less-regulated, opaque, and potentially riskier corners of the global financial system, thereby reducing U.S. oversight and competitiveness while increasing systemic risk.

Meanwhile, renowned analyst Ali Martinez provides some key insights on the LINK market, highlighting the potential price targets for the next breakout. Related Reading: Litecoin Structure Intact, But $63 Remains The Line Bulls Must Defend Chainlink In Compression Phase Between $12-$15 — What Next? In a recent X post, Martinez shares an analysis of the LINK 12-hour chart, which shows the altcoin has been range-bound between key support at $11.89 and resistance near $14.64, a structure that has remained intact over multiple trading sessions stretching back to 2025. This price behavior implies that neither bulls nor bears have been able to assert sustained control as each attempt to push higher has been capped near the upper boundary of the channel, while pullbacks have consistently found buyers around the $11.89 support zone. From a technical standpoint, the channel highlights a phase of consolidation following earlier volatility. Therefore, this structure may be laying the groundwork for a more decisive move once the price escapes the current boundaries. The $14.64 resistance level remains the key hurdle for bullish continuation. A confirmed breakout above this zone, ideally supported by rising volume, could reignite upside momentum with potential targets set at $17.00. On the downside, a loss of the $11.89 support could change the technical outlook, exposing LINK to deeper retracements, with potential around $10.00. For now, however, this support has held firm, reinforcing the validity of the channel and keeping bearish momentum in check.

The Road to $21.5 Is Beginning,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-xrp-rally-is-starting-the-road-to-21-5-is-beginning/,"Market transitions rarely feel obvious in real time. They often emerge quietly, after extended periods of consolidation and uncertainty, when sentiment still leans cautious. XRP now appears to be entering such a transition, where price behavior suggests accumulation rather than distribution and structure begins to favor expansion over decline. That view aligns with a recent analysis shared by CW on X, a crypto analyst with a PhD in Materials Science, who examined XRP through the lens of Elliott Wave theory. His assessment suggests that the market has already shifted into the early stages of a new bullish cycle, setting the foundation for a much larger move. Elliott Wave Analysis Points to a New Phase CW’s outlook relies on Elliott Wave structure, which maps market movements as repeating cycles driven by crowd psychology. According to his analysis, XRP has completed a prolonged corrective phase that followed its previous macro advance. The market now appears to be transitioning into a fresh impulsive wave. The $XRP rally is starting. The road to $21.5 is beginning. This is the Phase 4 peak. The first goal is to break through the ATH. https://t.co/kK0V4VgacH pic.twitter.com/WScCa1xzXS — CW (@CW8900) January 23, 2026 This phase transition matters because impulsive waves historically produce the strongest price appreciation. CW identifies the current period as the opening of Phase 4, a stage that has previously marked the most explosive portion of XRP’s bull cycles. The All-Time High as the First Major Test Before XRP can fully enter price discovery, it must overcome a critical technical barrier. The prior all-time high near $3.84 stands as the first major objective in the emerging rally. A decisive break above this level would confirm a higher high on the macro timeframe and validate the broader bullish structure. Such breakouts often shift market behavior. Once price moves beyond a former peak, selling pressure typically thins, and momentum-driven participation tends to accelerate. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why the $21.5 Target Defines the Cycle CW’s $21.5 projection represents the anticipated peak of Phase 4 within the current Elliott Wave cycle. The target derives from Fibonacci extensions applied to XRP’s completed wave structure and mirrors proportional advances seen in earlier cycles. Rather than depending on short-term indicators, the projection reflects long-term symmetry, historical price behavior, and completed corrective patterns. This approach grounds the forecast in structure rather than speculation. Structure Favors Expansion Over Volatility Although short-term pullbacks remain possible , CW’s analysis emphasizes the broader trend rather than daily price swings. The current structure suggests that XRP has shifted from correction to expansion, a transition that typically unfolds over months. If this wave interpretation continues to play out, XRP’s focus will likely move from defending support to extending gains. In that context, the path toward $21.5 begins not with sudden hype, but with a confirmed structural shift that now points higher.

Savings accounts that pay interest on digital assets have become mainstream. Gone are the days when earning yield meant locking funds for months or navigating complex on-chain protocols. In 2026, flexible savings accounts with transparent rates and instant access have become the standard. This review explains how these accounts work, why they matter, and which platforms currently offer the best blend of security, yield, and liquidity. How Crypto Savings Accounts Work A crypto savings account functions like a traditional bank savings account, but with higher potential returns and greater flexibility. You deposit assets such as BTC or stablecoins, and the platform lends them to borrowers, uses them in liquidity markets, or deploys them in low-risk yield strategies. Interest is then paid back to you, usually on a daily, weekly, or monthly schedule. The key difference in 2026 is that many accounts no longer require fixed lock-ups. Instead, they provide daily interest with instant access to funds, shifting the emphasis from yield maximization to user control and transparency. Clapp Flexible Savings: Simple, Daily Interest With Full Access Clapp is one of the most user-friendly and predictable savings products in the market. Clapp Flexible Savings account allows users to earn interest on popular cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and fiat, including BTC, USDT, USDC, and EUR. Once funds are deposited, interest starts accruing immediately and is credited daily. There are no lock-ups, no penalties for early withdrawal, and no hidden tiers affecting your earnings. The interest rate for stablecoins and EUR is currently 5.2%, displayed clearly in the app with no conditional strings attached. Users retain full liquidity: sell, transfer, or convert assets at any time without impacting accrued interest or reducing the earning rate. Clapp also smooths the bridge between traditional and crypto finance. SEPA Instant makes EUR deposits straightforward and fast, and interest begins as soon as the funds clear. Custody is backed by Fireblocks’ institutional-grade infrastructure, and Clapp Finance operates as a registered VASP in the Czech Republic under EU compliance standards. This combination of daily interest, instant access, transparent rates, and regulated custody places Clapp at the forefront of flexible savings solutions in 2026. Binance Earn: Scale, Variety, and Flexible Yield Binance Earn continues to be one of the broadest crypto yield marketplaces. It offers flexible savings accounts that accrue interest daily or periodically while allowing users to withdraw assets on demand. In addition to flexible products, Binance features locking terms, Launchpool incentives, and staking options. The platform’s global scale and liquidity supply deep markets for major tokens, but regulatory availability varies by jurisdiction. Rates tend to compete for high-volume assets, especially stablecoins. For users comfortable navigating a wide product set and monitoring changing APYs, Binance Earn provides flexibility and reach. Coinbase: Regulated Yields With Simplicity Coinbase’s savings and rewards products appeal to users seeking regulated, straightforward yield without excessive complexity. The platform’s primary focus is compliance and ease of use. Its yield products include rewards on select cryptocurrencies and staking on supported Proof-of-Stake networks. While Coinbase does not offer the highest yields on the market, it provides predictable returns within a fully regulated framework. Interest is generated based on on-chain rewards or established lending markets, making it suitable for users who prioritize clarity and regulatory oversight over maximum APY. Ledn: Conservative Yield With Transparent Risk Ledn’s savings accounts emphasize conservatism and transparency. The platform focuses on BTC and USDC, using fully collateralized lending models with frequent proof-of-reserves attestations. Ledn’s approach is not about chasing high yields; it’s about predictable, documented returns with clear audit trails. The trade-off is a narrower asset set and generally lower APYs compared to more aggressive platforms. For holders focused on preserving capital and earning modest yield without complex products, Ledn remains a reputable option. How to Compare Crypto Savings Accounts in 2026 Evaluating savings platforms requires attention to several practical factors: Liquidity versus yield: Flexible accounts prioritize access and daily accrual. Fixed terms offer higher rates but reduce access. Transparency of rates: Clearly displayed APYs with documented yield mechanics reduce uncertainty. Custody and compliance: Platforms with regulated status or institutional custody decrease counterparty risk. Asset support: Broader asset coverage allows earnings across more of your portfolio. Interest frequency: Daily accrual compounds faster and gives clearer insight into earnings. These criteria help users distinguish between products that merely promise high APY and those that deliver steady, accessible yield. Final Thought Crypto savings accounts are now a mainstream part of earning passive income. In 2026, the emphasis has shifted toward daily interest, liquidity, and transparent yield generation — a trend that favors platforms designed for user control over speculative strategies. Clapp Flexible Savings product leads with daily payouts, clear rates, and unrestricted access. Other providers like Bitget, Binance, Coinbase, and Ledn each serve different priorities, from asset breadth to regulated simplicity and conservative yield. FAQ: Best Crypto Savings Accounts in 2026 What is a crypto savings account?A crypto savings account lets you deposit digital assets and earn interest over time. Yield is typically generated through lending, liquidity markets, or collateralized strategies. Do I lose access to my crypto?Flexible savings accounts do not lock funds. You retain access and can withdraw or convert assets at any time without penalties. How often is interest credited?Most flexible products credit interest daily, though schedules vary by provider. Daily accrual compounds faster and provides better transparency. Are interest rates guaranteed?Rates are generally variable and can change with market demand. Platforms with transparent APYs and clear yield mechanisms provide better predictability. Is my crypto safe?No product is risk-free. Custodial risk, counterparty exposure, and platform solvency are ongoing considerations. Platforms with regulatory clarity and institutional custody help reduce these risks.

Cryptocurrency gains 0.54% of its value. GRT coin faces resistance around $0.0386. On January 24, 2026, The Graph price analysis revealed an increasing trend. The altcoin’s price increased to $0.0367 in the past 24 hours. At the same time, the currency gained 0.54% of its value today. Despite the bearish price movement a day ago, market events remained favorable for the bulls today as the token’s value increased. The Graph 1-day chart analysis The one-day price chart of The Graph confirmed a bullish trend in the market. The cryptocurrency’s value has increased to $0.0367 over the last 24 hours. The high volatility levels also suggest a higher chance of a reversal or further increase in the price levels. The distance between the Bollinger Bands defines the intensity of volatility. This distance is wide, suggesting high volatility in the market. Currently, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance, has moved to $0.0449. Conversely, its lower limit, serving as the support, has moved to $0.0355. GRT/USD 1-day price chart. Image source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator confirms rising buying interest. The index has increased to the 41 level today and is trending within the neutral region. If bullish momentum continues to grow, further stability in the market can be expected. The Graph 4-hour chart analysis The four-hour price analysis of The Graph coin indicates a bearish trend. Sellers are now aiming for a push lower, below immediate support levels, as the selling pressure is returning. The Bollinger Bands have converged, as the distance between the indicator’s arms is narrow, resulting in low volatility levels. This decrease in volatility signifies higher market predictability in the short term. Moving forward, the upper Bollinger Band has shifted to $0.0375, indicating the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger Band has moved to $0.0362, securing the support. GRT/USD 4-hour price chart. Image source: TradingView The RSI indicator is moving downwards within the neutral area for now, and it is trending below the centerline of the neutral region. The indicator’s value decreased to 42 in the last four hours. The downward curve on the RSI graph represents an imbalanced trading setup in the market. A further downside is possible given the recent bearish progression.

The Graph price analysis gives a relatively bullish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. The coin’s price increased to $0.0367 in the past 24 hours. A continuation of the current price action might bring more opportunities for investors. The high volatility on the daily chart shows that there is a higher chance of further price increments, which, if they occur, can lead to a retest of the $0.0386 resistance. Why is GRT up? The increase in the Graph’s value could be attributed to the general market sentiment. Moreover, the past four days supported the bulls, as the price was increasing, so the coin is moving up today after continuing its uptrend. Is The Graph a good investment? The Graph rivals some Web2 data oracles for its efficiency and low costs. GRT, its native token, however, remains a victim of general market dynamics and high volatility. If observed over the larger picture, the current sentiment is bearish, with predictions pointing to higher price growth. It is advised to do your own research and conduct investment advice before investing in the volatile market. Will GRT reach $0.5? The Graph token should trade above $0.3 in 2032. In that year, the price will range between $0.298007 and $0.322841, which is quite lower than $0.5. Will GRT reach $1? Per the analysts’ The Graph forecast, it remains unlikely that GRT will get to $1 by 2032. Will GRT reach $10? Considering GRT’s current price and market cap, it remains highly unlikely that it will reach $10 in the next ten years. Does GRT have a good long-term future? According to the market assumptions, GRT is set to trade higher in the years to come. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Hence, it is advised to do your own research and conduct in-depth investment advice before investing in the volatile market.

Crypto savings accounts allow holders to put unused assets to work, generating passive income while retaining liquidity. These products have evolved beyond simple earn programs into flexible savings accounts , fixed-term deposits, staking, and structured yield products, each with different trade-offs in yield, lock-up terms, and access. This review highlights the top crypto savings platforms available today, comparing their approach to yield, liquidity, asset support, and transparency. Clapp Flexible Savings — Daily Interest, Instant Access, Clear Yields Clapp’s Flexible Savings account exemplifies the newer generation of crypto yield products that prioritize liquidity and transparency. Instead of tying users into fixed terms or tiered rates, Clapp delivers a straightforward savings experience with daily interest accrual, no lock-ups, and clear, fixed APYs displayed in the app. Interest begins accumulating immediately upon deposit for assets including BTC, USDT, USDC, and EUR. For stablecoins and EUR, Clapp currently offers 5.2% APY with no hidden tiers or conditional bonuses — what you see is what you earn. Full 24/7 withdrawal access ensures users can move, sell, or convert assets at any time without forfeiting earned interest. Clapp’s infrastructure is built around compliance and security: Clapp Finance is a registered VASP in the Czech Republic operating under EU AML standards, and assets are secured through Fireblocks’ institutional-grade custody. By combining predictable yields with open liquidity, Clapp appeals to users seeking a true savings-style account for crypto. Binance — Scale and Variety Across Earn Products Binance Earn remains one of the most comprehensive options for earning yield across crypto assets. Flexible savings products on Binance allow users to earn interest while maintaining liquidity, earning daily or periodic payouts depending on the product. Combined with fixed-term products and staking options, Binance offers one of the largest suites of earn products in the industry. The platform’s global scale provides deep liquidity and broad asset coverage, though regulatory availability may vary by region. Rates on stablecoins and major cryptocurrencies tend to be competitive, especially for users who closely monitor shifting APYs and promotions. Coinbase — Simple, Compliance-Focused Yield Coinbase positions its yield offerings for users who prioritize regulatory clarity and ease of use. Its savings-style products focus on a curated set of assets, including staking on supported Proof-of-Stake tokens and interest rewards on select stablecoins. Unlike some platforms with broad yield marketplaces, Coinbase limits its offerings to assets with transparent reward mechanisms. Yields on staking products vary by network and are governed by on-chain reward schedules, making Coinbase especially appealing to users who prioritize compliance and straightforward reward structures. YouHodler — High Potential Yield with Advanced Features YouHodler delivers some of the higher headline yields across stablecoins and other assets, supported by a suite of products including traditional savings, structured earn, and leverage-enabled features. This diversity allows yield-hungry users to pursue returns beyond simple savings, although it introduces complexity and risk compared to pure savings accounts. YouHodler’s flexible savings products can generate competitive returns, but they co-exist with multi-feature tools that require a deeper understanding of yield generation mechanics. Ledn — Conservative, Transparent Savings for BTC and USDC Ledn focuses on conservative yield with transparency. Its interest accounts for Bitcoin and USDC operate on fully collateralized lending models, supported by regular proof-of-reserves attestations. Ledn does not chase high promotional rates; instead, it prioritizes transparent execution and predictable returns. This makes it appealing for users who seek stable yields on major assets without complex product layers. How to Evaluate Crypto Savings Accounts in 2026 When choosing a savings platform, consider these core factors: Liquidity vs. yield trade-off: Flexible savings offer instant access; fixed yields often require lock-ups for higher APYs. Transparency: Clearly displayed APYs and documented yield mechanics signal stronger risk management. Custody and regulation: Platforms with clear regulatory standing and institutional custody infrastructure reduce counterparty risk. Asset support: The range of supported cryptocurrencies affects your ability to earn interest across your portfolio. Payout frequency: Daily accrual compounds returns faster, especially on stablecoin balances. Final Thoughts Crypto savings accounts have matured into essential tools for earning passive income on digital assets in 2026. While options vary from simple yield accounts to advanced staking and structured products, the best platforms balance security, liquidity, and transparency. Clapp’s Flexible Savings stands out for users who want daily interest with full liquidity and clear, fixed rates. Bitget and Binance offer breadth and flexibility across asset types and product structures, Coinbase emphasizes compliance and simplicity, YouHodler targets higher potential yield with advanced features, and Ledn prioritizes conservative, transparent execution. Understanding your own priorities — whether it’s access, yield, or simplicity — will guide you to the savings account that aligns with your strategy. FAQ: Crypto Savings Accounts in 2026 What is a crypto savings account? A crypto savings account allows you to deposit digital assets and earn interest over time. Yield is typically generated through lending, collateralized strategies, or low-risk market activity, depending on the platform. What is the difference between flexible and fixed crypto savings? Flexible savings allow you to withdraw funds at any time while continuing to earn interest. Fixed savings require locking assets for a set period in exchange for higher rates but reduced liquidity. How often is interest paid? This depends on the platform. Some accounts credit interest daily, others weekly or monthly. Daily accrual compounds faster and offers greater transparency. Are crypto savings accounts safe? They are not risk-free. Risks include custodial risk, counterparty exposure, and regulatory changes. Platforms with clear regulation, transparent yield models, and reputable custody providers reduce — but do not eliminate — these risks. Why do interest rates differ so much between platforms? Rates depend on asset demand, lending activity, risk appetite, and whether funds are locked. Higher APYs often reflect higher risk or reduced liquidity. Can I earn interest on both crypto and fiat? Some platforms support both. For example, Clapp allows users to earn interest on BTC, stablecoins, and EUR, helping bridge traditional finance and crypto.

These indicators describe outcomes. They rarely explain how leadership is established in the first place. In practice, projects tend to secure their position much earlier, through visibility and recognition. Before users commit capital, they encounter names repeatedly, across media, search results, and news feeds. By the time financial metrics begin to diverge, the competitive hierarchy is often already set. At Outset PR, market dominance is approached as a visibility problem. The objective is to establish a concentrated media presence quickly, allowing a project to anchor itself within a defined segment before competitors achieve comparable exposure. Mindshare precedes metrics For most crypto participants, decision-making is compressed. Users do not assess every new protocol or token independently. Instead, they rely on familiar signals: known brands, repeated mentions, and coverage from recognizable outlets. When a category is mentioned—wallets, Layer 2 networks, launchpads—only a limited number of projects come to mind. Those names benefit from accumulated exposure rather than superior technical understanding among users. In effect, they have already cleared the first barrier to adoption: recall. Why many projects fail to lead Projects that struggle to dominate their segment often do so not because of product deficiencies, but because their visibility is fragmented. Narratives are dispersed across unrelated topics, preventing search engines and readers from associating the brand with a specific use case. Media placements are selected for prestige rather than performance, resulting in brief attention spikes that fade quickly. In many cases, PR activity consists of isolated announcements rather than sustained presence. The result is exposure without accumulation—coverage that does not compound into recognition. Engineering visibility at scale Outset PR treats market dominance as a function of speed, volume, and distribution mechanics. Media outlets are selected based on their ability to surface content through Google Top Stories and Discover, where readers are already consuming adjacent news. Coverage is deployed in high volume over short timeframes to establish immediate presence, often within weeks rather than quarters. Content is structured to persist beyond the initial distribution window, allowing articles to continue ranking in search results after active promotion subsides. Campaigns are frequently tailored to specific regions, reinforcing visibility among local audiences and strengthening relevance in targeted markets. Not every exposure is expected to convert immediately. Repeated visibility keeps a project familiar. When user intent forms later, recognition already exists. Controlled visibility, not ubiquity Market dominance does not require universal exposure. It requires being difficult to ignore within a defined segment, geography, and period of time. In an industry where attention is limited and trust develops through repetition, structured visibility often separates category leaders from projects that fail to gain traction. That dynamic underpins Outset PR’s framework—and explains why concentrated, high-intensity presence can outweigh slower, diffuse exposure in crypto markets.

Here’s What It Means",https://timestabloid.com/no-xrp-price-discovery-for-2922-days-heres-what-it-means/,"XRP has been trading without breaking into new price discovery for 2,922 days, according to the latest chart shared by crypto analyst Bird (@Bird_XRPL). On the monthly chart, XRP remains below the levels it reached during previous major rallies. The asset has shown periods of high volatility in the past, but for nearly 8 years, it has largely stayed within established price zones. This extended period of consolidation indicates a market that is holding its structure. Bird previously noted that the asset has been trading sideways for 416 days , suggesting a prolonged accumulation phase. These long consolidation periods often precede significant price moves, as market participants adjust positions in anticipation of a breakout. XRP hasn’t broken into price discovery for 2,922 days… and counting https://t.co/8Le7sBZeSs pic.twitter.com/Avfe1Ie67e — Bird (@Bird_XRPL) January 23, 2026 Current Market Levels At the time of his analysis, XRP traded near $1.90. The chart shows the asset is well below its peak of $3.65 that it reached in July 2025. Monthly candles show repeated testing of support levels near $0.50 after the breakout in 2017. The digital asset experienced another breakout in 2024, but did not climb significantly higher than previous peaks. Volume patterns also provide insight. For over 2,922 days without price discovery, XRP has accumulated significant trading volume, totaling over $176 billion. This level of activity demonstrates consistent market interest and the potential for strong momentum once a breakout occurs . Technical Perspective Technically, the chart reveals compression in price action. XRP has maintained a clear range for years, moving between established highs and lows. The prolonged sideways movement often reduces short-term volatility while building pressure for larger directional moves. Bird’s post emphasizes the importance of the extended trading period. Extended ranges like this can lead to concentrated buying pressure as the asset approaches resistance levels. This setup frequently precedes periods of rapid gains once market conditions align. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Potential Market Behavior Given the consolidation duration, XRP is positioned for an explosive phase if it breaks above prior highs. Historical cycles suggest that periods of extended accumulation can produce above-average gains when the price discovery finally sets in. Market participants may anticipate a renewed uptrend as the asset tests previous resistance levels. Investors monitoring XRP should note the significance of nearly 8 years of combined trading and consolidation activity. Breakouts after such extended ranges often occur rapidly, with increased volatility and trading volume. This suggests that XRP may see another phase of price discovery once it surpasses the previous highs. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The decision, confirmed by multiple official sources, signals a preference for stability over further tightening. This move carries broad implications not only for global markets, but also for crypto, where liquidity cycles, funding conditions, and cross-border carry trades increasingly shape price behavior. As a data-driven crypto PR agency, Outset PR watches market developments to shape market-fit narratives, seize moments of opportunity, and drive sustained market relevance. BOJ Holds at 0.75% Amid Bond Market Strain and Political Pressures The Bank of Japan chose to keep rates unchanged in January 2026 as it navigates a sensitive macro backdrop: Bond market volatility: Japanese government bonds have experienced sharp swings in recent weeks, making policymakers hesitant to add stress by adjusting rates. Political timing: With snap elections approaching, the central bank is prioritizing policy continuity. Economic projections: Updated forecasts show inflation remaining near or above the 2% target, while GDP growth expectations have been revised upward—supporting a cautious, potentially hawkish stance. In effect, the BOJ is holding steady while keeping the door open for future tightening depending on inflation durability. Why This Matters for Crypto Markets Although Japanese monetary policy may appear geographically isolated, its influence on global liquidity is material for risk assets like Bitcoin and large altcoins. Two key mechanisms explain why: 1. Yen Carry Trade Flows For decades, traders borrowed in yen at ultra-low rates to invest in higher-yielding global assets.With BOJ rates now at a three-decade high: The yen carry trade becomes less attractive, reducing global leverage. Funding conditions tighten across international markets, including crypto. Risk appetite can weaken as investors reduce exposure to volatile assets. 2. Japanese Yield Volatility Rising or unstable JGB yields often spill over into global fixed-income markets, influencing liquidity conditions everywhere. Higher-yield environments generally: Increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets (BTC, ETH) Encourage deleveraging Create spillover effects into crypto derivatives markets This partly explains why crypto markets reacted immediately following the BOJ announcement. Crypto Market Reaction: Risk Appetite Softens Over the past 24 hours: Total crypto market cap declined around 1% Fear indicators shifted from neutral to fear, suggesting declining investor confidence Trading volumes fell roughly one-third according to one BOJ-focused market recap Markets turned “choppy” as traders balanced BOJ policy, bond volatility, and derivatives expiry flows Bitcoin itself traded mostly sideways, fluctuating within a narrow range from the high-$80,000s to around $90,000, reflecting indecision rather than panic. Source: coinmarketcap The reaction underscores how sensitive crypto markets are to global macro signals—even when those signals originate outside Western monetary centers. Visibility Matters During Macro Shifts: How Outset PR Optimizes Crypto PR Budgets Macro events like the BOJ’s rate decision not only affect asset prices—they affect narrative cycles, media interest, and the competition for visibility among crypto projects. In periods of tighter liquidity, every PR dollar must work harder, and this is precisely where Outset PR’s data-driven approach stands out. Traditionally, crypto PR meant placing stories wherever possible, hoping coverage translated into visibility. But impressions and actual reach often diverged sharply, leaving founders unsure whether a campaign genuinely moved the needle. Outset PR solved this inefficiency with its proprietary Syndication Map , a tool built by the agency’s analysts to identify which media outlets consistently generate the largest traffic flows and downstream republications.Smarter Campaigns, Lower Costs Rather than scattershot outreach, Outset PR builds tightly optimized campaigns focused on impact over volume. By prioritizing publications that consistently deliver ROI, clients avoid overspending on low-visibility outlets. Well-placed articles rarely stay in one location. Outset PR campaigns frequently achieve 10x visibility as stories are syndicated across: CoinMarketCap Binance Square Yahoo Finance Additional aggregators and financial outlets A standout example is StealthEX, whose targeted tier-1 placement strategy resulted in 92 republications and more than 3 billion total impressions. Setting a New Standard for Crypto PR As macro forces like BOJ policy influence market sentiment, projects must communicate clearly, strategically, and efficiently. Outset PR’s data-first methodology allows teams to extend reach even during risk-off periods—a competitive advantage when visibility becomes harder to earn. Bottom Line The BOJ’s January decision to keep rates at 0.75% reinforces a cautious but steady policy stance. For crypto, the implications are immediate: tighter funding dynamics, softer risk appetite, reduced volumes, and choppier price action. While the market reaction thus far has been modest, macro conditions remain fragile—and traders should continue monitoring BOJ policy as a meaningful driver of global liquidity and crypto volatility.

On-chain data from RWA.xyz showed that the total value has increased by around 7.59% over the past seven days. The data revealed that the total value of U.S. Treasuries now stands at $10.13 billion. Across 64 assets, there are nearly 59,000 holders, and the average 7-day APY is 3.28%, down from 5.28% a week earlier. Tokenized U.S. Treasuries lead growth across networks Tokenized U.S. Treasuries are digital representations of U.S. government debt, an asset that has long supported the contemporary economy. The money invested by an institution or, less frequently, an individual purchasing a tokenized U.S. Treasury is subsequently used to buy actual U.S. Treasury notes or short-term loans backed by Treasuries. In exchange, the investor receives a token that yields. According to the latest treasury product metrics, Circle USYC from Circle International was the most popular tokenized U.S. Treasury product, with a $1.69 billion market capitalization and a 7-day annual percentage yield of 3.01%. Ondo U.S. Dollar Yield (USDY) owned $1.20 billion, and BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund ( BUIDL ) held $1.68 billion. Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (BENJI), at $892 million, and Ondo Short-Term US Government Bond Fund (OUSG), at $733 million, were two other noteworthy products. According to market cap by network, most tokenized U.S. Treasury products (and similar digital assets) were held in Ethereum , totaling around $5.6 billion. BNB Chain followed with $2.1 billion, while Stellar took third place with $698.7 million. Solana, Aptos, and Avalanche C-Chain held $510.8 million, $331.3 million, $238.4 million, respectively. Arbitrum held the lowest with $199.1 million. Regarding net flows, over the last 30 days, Ondo’s USDY led with $567 million, followed by Centrifuge’s JTRSY with $240 million. Franklin’s BENJI and Spiko’s USTBL earned $71 million and $51 million, respectively, while Circle’s USYC contributed $164 million. Tokenized treasuries drive blockchain access for diverse investors Tokenized U.S. Treasury instruments continue to draw significant attention from institutional and high-net-worth investors, but their high minimum investment requirements and screening procedures remain a challenge. BlackRock’s BUIDL, for example, has a $5 million minimum investment requirement, which reflects its focus on institutional investors. Other products similarly maintain eligibility requirements to guarantee participation by qualified buyers. On the other hand, some products, such as Ondo’s USDY, which currently has over 17,000 individual holders, target retail investors, especially those outside the United States. According to Arkham Intelligence research, these products offer several key advantages to holders, including the ability to be exchanged and redeemed 24/7, since they are on-chain. The U.S. government and reputable investment management companies such as BlackRock also back them. Additionally, they can be used as collateral in DeFi. These features, however, are making tokenized U.S. Treasuries more popular, which appeals to both institutional and individual investors. Building on this trend, investment giant BlackRock has identified tokenization and cryptocurrency as the “themes driving markets” in 2026. In the 2026 Thematic Outlook, BlackRock pointed out that tokenization, or the digital representation of real-world assets like stocks and real estate, is gaining traction. According to the investment firm, this shift is part of a change in how investors access markets. An early example of a tokenized asset is a stablecoin, such as one backed by the U.S. dollar. “In our view, as tokenization continues to rise, so will the opportunity to access assets beyond cash and U.S. Treasuries via the blockchain,” the report stated. It specifically mentioned the Ethereum blockchain as a potential beneficiary of tokenization expansion, given its widespread use in developing decentralized apps and token infrastructure.

This development marks a pivotal moment in the evolving NFT landscape, signaling strategic shifts within the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. Consequently, the platform now operates exclusively in withdrawal-only mode, enabling users to secure their digital assets before the final closure. Understanding the Nifty Gateway Shutdown Announcement Nifty Gateway communicated its decision through official channels on Monday morning. The platform will permanently cease all trading, minting, and marketplace operations at 11:59 PM UTC on February 23. However, the withdrawal functionality remains active until that deadline. This announcement follows months of industry speculation about the platform’s future amid changing market conditions. Notably, the NFT sector has experienced substantial volatility since its 2021 peak, with trading volumes declining across most major platforms throughout 2024. Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, acquired Nifty Gateway in 2019. The platform quickly gained prominence through high-profile NFT drops featuring artists like Beeple, Pak, and Trevor Jones. During its operational period, Nifty Gateway facilitated over $1.2 billion in NFT transactions, according to blockchain analytics firm DappRadar. The shutdown represents a strategic realignment for Gemini as the company focuses resources on core exchange services and regulatory compliance initiatives. Immediate Impact on Digital Art Collectors Digital art collectors holding assets on Nifty Gateway must take immediate action. The platform has established clear procedures for asset migration. Users should complete all withdrawals before the February 23 deadline to avoid potential complications. Fortunately, the process involves connecting a compatible cryptocurrency wallet and transferring NFTs to self-custody solutions. Several alternative marketplaces have already announced support for former Nifty Gateway users, including OpenSea, Rarible, and Foundation. The following table outlines key dates and actions for affected users: Date Action Required Status February 10-23, 2025 Withdraw all NFTs and funds Active February 23, 2025 Platform shutdown complete Scheduled Post-February 23 No access to marketplace Inactive Industry experts recommend that collectors verify wallet compatibility before initiating transfers. Additionally, users should document their transaction history for tax and ownership verification purposes. The blockchain’s immutable nature ensures that NFT ownership records remain secure regardless of marketplace status, but accessibility depends on proper wallet management. Historical Context of NFT Market Evolution The NFT market has undergone remarkable transformation since its emergence. Initially, platforms like Nifty Gateway democratized digital art collection through user-friendly interfaces and credit card integration. However, market dynamics shifted significantly throughout 2023 and 2024. Trading volumes declined approximately 65% from their 2022 peak, according to CryptoSlam data. This contraction prompted consolidation within the industry, with several smaller platforms either closing or merging with larger entities. Several factors contributed to this market correction: Regulatory developments: Increased scrutiny from global financial authorities Technological maturation: Migration toward more efficient blockchain networks Collector behavior changes: Shift toward utility-focused NFTs rather than pure collectibles Economic conditions: Broader cryptocurrency market volatility affecting discretionary spending Nifty Gateway’s closure reflects these broader industry trends rather than isolated operational challenges. The platform maintained a loyal user base throughout its operational period but faced increasing competition from both established marketplaces and emerging decentralized alternatives. Expert Analysis: What This Means for Digital Art Dr. Elena Rodriguez, blockchain researcher at Stanford University, provides valuable perspective on this development. “Platform closures represent natural market evolution,” she explains. “The NFT ecosystem is maturing beyond speculative trading toward sustainable models emphasizing artist support and collector value.” Rodriguez notes that while marketplace consolidation may continue, the fundamental technology supporting digital ownership remains robust. Her research indicates that artist royalties and secondary market mechanisms have become increasingly important considerations for collectors. Market data supports this analysis. According to NonFungible.com’s 2024 report, the average holding period for NFTs increased from 45 days in 2022 to 180 days in 2024. This suggests a shift toward longer-term collecting rather than rapid trading. Additionally, platforms emphasizing artist relationships and community building have demonstrated greater resilience during market downturns. The closure of Nifty Gateway may accelerate this trend toward more specialized, community-focused marketplaces. Technical Considerations for Asset Migration Users migrating assets from Nifty Gateway must understand several technical considerations. First, Ethereum network gas fees fluctuate based on congestion, potentially affecting withdrawal costs. Second, compatibility between wallet types and alternative marketplaces requires verification. Third, metadata preservation ensures that digital art maintains its associated information across platforms. Most NFTs utilize standardized formats like ERC-721, facilitating relatively straightforward transfers between compatible systems. The migration process involves these essential steps: Connect a Web3 wallet (MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, etc.) to Nifty Gateway Navigate to the withdrawal section of the user dashboard Select individual NFTs or use bulk selection tools Confirm blockchain transactions and pay associated gas fees Verify successful transfers on blockchain explorers like Etherscan Connect the same wallet to alternative marketplaces for continued trading Technical support remains available through Nifty Gateway’s help center until the shutdown date. The platform has committed to maintaining comprehensive documentation throughout the transition period. Users experiencing difficulties should consult these resources promptly, as support availability will cease after February 23. Broader Implications for Cryptocurrency Platforms The Nifty Gateway shutdown carries implications beyond the NFT sector. Gemini’s decision reflects strategic prioritization within the competitive cryptocurrency exchange landscape. Regulatory compliance, security infrastructure, and core trading services demand increasing resources as the industry matures. This move follows similar consolidations across cryptocurrency verticals throughout 2024, including lending platform adjustments and derivatives market restructuring. Market analysts observe that successful cryptocurrency businesses increasingly focus on sustainable revenue models rather than speculative ventures. The NFT marketplace sector demonstrated this pattern clearly, with platforms emphasizing artist partnerships and collector communities outperforming those focused primarily on trading volume. This evolution suggests that future NFT platforms may adopt hybrid models combining marketplace functionality with social features and educational resources. Furthermore, the integration of traditional financial elements continues to shape platform development. Several marketplaces now offer installment payment options, insurance products for digital assets, and institutional-grade custody solutions. These developments indicate maturation toward mainstream adoption, albeit with occasional setbacks like platform closures. The cryptocurrency industry’s resilience stems from its decentralized foundation, allowing innovation to continue despite individual platform challenges. Conclusion The Nifty Gateway shutdown represents a significant moment in digital art history, marking the closure of a pioneering NFT marketplace that helped popularize blockchain-based collectibles. While the platform’s February 23 closure date concludes one chapter, the broader NFT ecosystem continues evolving toward more sustainable models. Collectors must act promptly to secure their assets through proper withdrawal procedures before the deadline. Ultimately, this development reflects natural market consolidation rather than fundamental weakness in digital ownership concepts. The blockchain infrastructure supporting NFTs remains robust, ensuring that properly migrated assets retain their value and accessibility across alternative platforms. FAQs Q1: What happens to my NFTs if I don’t withdraw them before February 23? Your NFTs remain securely stored on the blockchain, but you will lose access through the Nifty Gateway interface. You must use your private keys and a compatible wallet to access them directly after the shutdown. Q2: Can I still trade my NFTs after withdrawing them from Nifty Gateway? Yes, you can trade withdrawn NFTs on any compatible marketplace like OpenSea, Rarible, or Foundation by connecting the same wallet containing your assets. Q3: Will Nifty Gateway provide any compensation or refunds to users? The platform has not announced compensation programs. Users retain full ownership of their digital assets and can withdraw them without fees beyond standard blockchain gas costs. Q4: How does this affect artists who previously sold work on Nifty Gateway? Artists maintain ownership rights and royalties as encoded in their smart contracts. They should direct collectors to alternative marketplaces for future secondary sales. Q5: What alternatives exist for NFT collectors after Nifty Gateway closes? Multiple established platforms continue operating, including OpenSea, Rarible, Foundation, SuperRare, and emerging decentralized alternatives like Blur and LooksRare.

Without swift intervention to steady the ship, the BTC treasury firm could be removed from the Nasdaq stock exchange. Companies have recently made headlines for buying into the “Bitcoin treasury” trend, holding BTC on their balance sheets to boost shareholder value. However, for companies like K Wave Media and Canaan Inc., the accompanying regulatory compliance is proving harsher than anticipated. K Wave Media under threat of delisting K Wave Media (KWM) has become the latest firm to announce a deficiency notice from Nasdaq. A similar notification was sent to Canaan Inc. (CAN) earlier in the month. K Wave Media, a South Korean-based cultural innovation firm that transitioned into digital asset management, reported that it received a written notice dated January 22, 2026, stating that it is no longer in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(C). This rule requires companies listed on the Nasdaq Global Market to maintain a minimum Market Value of Listed Securities (MVLS) of at least $50 million. The Nasdaq Stock Market has given K Wave 180 days to comply. Compliance means that the company’s MVLS must close at or above $50 million for at least 10 consecutive business days before the June 2026 deadline. The company received a previous warning on January 7, when its stock fell below the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement. Currently, K Wave shares are trading around $0.45, a massive drop from their 2025 highs. Cryptopolitan previously reported that Canaan Inc. also received a notice from the exchange because its American Depositary Shares (ADSs) had traded below $1.00 for 30 consecutive business days. Canaan has a July 13 deadline to fix the price deficiency. If it fails, it may have to resort to a reverse stock split or face removal from the exchange. What options do BTC treasury firms have to avoid delisting? For companies like K Wave and Canaan, the most common “quick fix” for a minimum bid price deficiency is a reverse stock split, which involves reducing the number of outstanding shares to artificially increase the price of each remaining share. However, when Digital Currency X Technology (DCX), a digital asset treasury firm with over $1.4 billion in reported BTC holdings, was notified on January 20 that it is scheduled for delisting on January 29, the company was denied the standard 180-day grace period because it had already performed multiple reverse splits in the past two years. K Wave Media has already appointed a new Chief Financial Officer, Yong Fang, to navigate these “complex financial landscapes.” The company has stated that it remains committed to its long-term strategy and is evaluating all available options to restore compliance. Canaan has also said it will take “ reasonable measures” to maintain its status. Deficiency notices are becoming increasingly common as Bitcoin itself remains strong, but the stocks of the companies with “Bitcoin treasuries” often suffer from high volatility and liquidity issues. In December 2025, the Bitcoin treasury firm Kindly MD (NAKA) received a similar notice and has until June 2026 to bring its stock price back above $1.00. Strive (ASST), which recently completed its acquisition of Semler Scientific on January 16, 2026, to become the 11th-largest public holder of Bitcoin, saw its shares tumble below $0.90 shortly after the merger. Despite holding over 12,797 BTC, Strive’s stock has declined nearly 80% since September 2025. Massive firms like Strategy (MicroStrategy) continue to grow, now holding 709,715 BTC, which it acquired for $53.92 billion at an average price of $75,979 per Bitcoin as of January 20.

The underlying asset has also suffered within the same timeframe, dropping below $2.00 and erasing much of the early 2026 gains. Weekly Outflows Dominate As reported at the time, the spot XRP ETFs registered their first red day on January 7 after being on a massive roll that continued nearly two months, since the first one, Canary Capital’s XRPC, debuted on November 13. Nevertheless, that week still ended with more net inflows as investors managed to offset the one-day losses. The subsequent trading week was all green , with almost $57 million entering the funds. However, the first trading day of the previous week brought all that to an end, as investors pulled out $53.32 million, the largest daily net outflow ever for the XRP ETFs. Given the fact that it was a shorter trading week, with Monday being MLK Day in the US, investors failed to rally and make up the losses. The net inflows for January 21 were just $7.16 million, followed by even more modest $2.09 million on Thursday, and $3.43 million on Friday. Data from SoSoValue shows that the net outflows for the four-day trading period stand at $40.64 million, making it the first red week since XRPC saw the light of day. The cumulative net inflows have also declined from a peak of $1.28 billion to $1.23 billion. XRP ETF Flows on SoSoValue XRP Suffers After skyrocketing at the start of 2026 from under $1.90 to $2.40, XRP was quickly rejected and driven south to $2.10, where it spent several days. However, the broader market’s correction prompted by the growing geopolitical tension brought it to its starting positions of around $1.90 as of press time. Analyst CW believes the price moves over the ongoing weekend would be crucial for the asset’s near-term performance, especially since it has returned “within the convergence after a fake breakout.” They noted that XRP can finally rally but only after it breaks out of its current pattern. $XRP is back within the convergence after a fake breakout.

OP has fallen more than 93.7% from its peak and hit a low of $0.2519 last month. This marked the token’s lowest price level ever in December. In response, Optimism DAO delegates are voting on a proposal to use protocol revenue to buy back OP tokens. The vote began on Thursday and will last six days, concluding on January 28. At the time of writing, delegates have cast more than 4.2 million votes in favor of the proposal, compared with just over 491.9K votes against it. Voters have the option to vote for, against, or abstain. The buyback proposal passes if the ‘for’ votes exceed the quorum and if the ‘for’ votes, relative to the total votes, exceed the approval threshold. The quorum for this proposal is at 30% and the approved threshold is 94.40%. If approved, the proposal would require the Optimism Foundation to spend half of the Superchain’s monthly revenue on purchasing OP. As revenue grows, the foundation would be required to buy more OP tokens each month. Supporters say this mechanism could help support the token’s price. The vote on OP tokens buyback is live. Source: Optimism website . DAO members split over OP’s buyback plans But the proposal has split the DAO. Some delegates support the plan, while others think it wastes funds and weakens Optimism’s financial runway. Critics point out that Optimism is currently a net seller of OP. PaperImperium, an Optimism DAO delegate, believes OP holders should vote against this buyback proposal. He thinks it is illogical to use valuable assets to buy back OP while continuing to sell tokens, especially if it shortens the project’s runway. PaperImperium is also concerned about OP buybacks execution. He said, “…This proposal uses an OTC desk instead of using Optimism’s own chain, which is a bad look.” The program is planned to operate over the counter (OTC) rather than on open markets. This means purchases would not directly affect OP market prices. Michael Vander Meiden, an Optimism DAO delegate, warned in a forum post that OTC buybacks could allow employees or investors to sell unlocked tokens into the program. He said , “This would be concerning because it defeats the purpose of aligning incentives, with unlocks currently happening at a rate much higher than the planned buybacks.” The Optimism Foundation said it chose OTC execution to simplify the process. It pledged to publicly report all OTC trades on stats[dot]optimism[dot]io or the governance forum. The debate comes in spite of Optimism’s expanding role in blockchain technology. Its OP Stack powers over 50 blockchains, such as Uniswap’s Unichain, Coinbase’s Base , Kraken’s Ink, Zora Network, Sam Altam’s World Chain and other blockchains. Can buybacks fix token slumps? Skepticism toward buybacks extends beyond Optimism. Researchers at Messari say that buyback strategies often waste money. They divert funds from marketing and growth, and the overall impact of buybacks on token prices is minimal. Several crypto projects considered ending token buyback programs. Siong Ong, founder of Jupiter DEX asked community members if the exchange should stop buying JUP tokens back since it did not benefit the price. The DEX spent more than $70 million on buybacks last year, and the price didn’t move much. GFXlabs argued in a forum post that Optimism should prioritize creating and sharing a business plan for long-term financial sustainability. He added that a buyback does not address this issue and could make it worse. Several DAO members have echoed these points. Supporters of the proposal think it represents progress. Milo Bowman, an Optimism DAO delegate, said that running buybacks alongside emissions is acceptable even if they partially offset each other. He added that the buyback framework allows participants to better model the outcomes of a potential 100-fold growth of the Superchain.

This move marks a power play by the asset management firm to further establish itself in the cryptocurrency space. Grayscale Looks To Add To List Of Crypto-Linked ETFs On Friday, January 23, Grayscale filed an S-1 registration statement with the SEC to launch a spot BNB exchange-traded fund in the US. According to the SEC filing, the proposed Grayscale ETF would hold the Binance ecosystem’s native token directly and issue shares designed to track the token’s market value. This Grayscale investment product, if approved, would offer US investors exposure to the BNB token without having to own or hold the asset themselves. The asset manager’s registration statement also revealed that the exchange-traded fund would trade on the Nasdaq exchange under the ticker symbol GBNB, subject to regulatory approval. It is worth mentioning that Grayscale is not the first asset manager to file for a spot BNB ETF, as VanEck applied as far back as April 2025. However, this latest filing reflects the firm’s resolve to expand its list of crypto-linked investment products, especially after the successful launch of the Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. It was always only a matter of time before BNB, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, received extra attention from institutions focused on exchange-traded products. As such, this move by Grayscale has caught the attention of the cryptocurrency market, including former Binance CEO Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao. In a Friday post on the social media platform X, CZ said that Grayscale’s submission of its S-1 filing to the SEC represents a small step toward making the United States the capital of crypto. “A small step in helping to make America the Capital of Crypto, by giving access to the 3rd largest crypto,” the Binance co-founder wrote on Friday. Meanwhile, Bloomberg ETF expert James Seyffart concurred that a spot ETF approval could mean that the BNB token will be classified as a commodity rather than a security. This is because the approval of an exchange-traded fund is often an indication that the SEC views the underlying asset as a commodity rather than as a security. BNB Price At A Glance After making a play for $900 on Friday afternoon, the price of BNB now stands at around $890. According to data from CoinGecko, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency is down by nearly 5% in the past seven days.",Crypto News|binance|BNB|bnbusdt|crypto news|Grayscale|Spot BNB ETF,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-24 14:00:37

The new initiative comes as blockchain networks face mounting pressure to defend against quantum computing threats that industry experts increasingly warn could materialize within years rather than decades. Ethereum researcher Justin Drake announced the team formation on Friday, revealing that Thomas Coratger will lead the effort alongside Emile, a core contributor to leanVM. “ After years of quiet R&D, EF management has officially declared PQ security a top strategic priority, ” Drake said, adding that the foundation has been developing its quantum strategy since a 2019 presentation at StarkWare Sessions.

Antonio Sanso will kick off bi-weekly All Core Devs Post Quantum breakout calls next month, focusing on user-facing security, including dedicated precompiles, account abstraction, and transaction signature aggregation with leanVM. The foundation announced two $1 million prize competitions to strengthen cryptographic foundations. The newly launched Poseidon Prize targets the hardening of the Poseidon hash function, while the existing Proximity Prize continues to drive hash-based cryptography research. “ We are betting big on hash-based cryptography to enjoy the strongest and leanest cryptographic foundations, ” Drake stated. Multi-client post-quantum consensus development networks are already operational, with pioneer teams including Zeam, Ream Labs, PierTwo, Gean client, and Ethlambda working alongside established consensus clients Lighthouse, Grandine, and Prysm. Weekly post-quantum interop calls, coordinated by Will Corcoran, are managing collaborative technical development across these diverse implementation teams. The foundation will host a three-day expert workshop in October, bringing together top specialists from around the world, building on last year’s post-quantum workshop in Cambridge. An additional dedicated post-quantum day is scheduled for March 29 in Cannes, ahead of EthCC, to create multiple forums for advancing research and coordination across the global Ethereum development community. Industry Voices Split on Timeline Urgency The quantum threat has divided blockchain leaders on both timeline predictions and strategic priorities. Independent Ethereum educator sassal.eth called quantum computing “ a very real threat for blockchains ” that is “ coming sooner than most people think, ” praising the foundation’s defensive preparations. Pantera Capital General Partner Franklin Bi predicted that traditional financial institutions will struggle with the transition to post-quantum cryptography. “ People are over-estimating how quickly Wall Street will adapt to post-quantum cryptography, ” Bi said, adding that blockchain networks possess unique capabilities for system-wide upgrades at a global scale. The post-quantum race begins. My prediction: People are over-estimating how quickly Wall Street will adapt to post-quantum cryptography.

Bitcoin community assessments remain sharply contested. Vitalik Buterin previously shared Metaculus data showing a median 2040 timeline for quantum computers breaking modern cryptography, with roughly a 20% probability before the end of 2030. Metaculus's median date for when quantum computers will break modern cryptography is 2040: https://t.co/Li8ni8A9Ox Seemingly about a 20% chance it will be before end of 2030. — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) August 27, 2025 Blockstream CEO Adam Back has dismissed near-term concerns , claiming practical threats remain decades away and accusing critics of creating unnecessary market alarm. Project ZKM contributor Stephen Duan acknowledged transition challenges while calling quantum resistance “ inevitable ,” noting that his team will soon upgrade multiset hashing to a lattice-based construction. ZKsync inventor Alex Gluk also said the network’s Airbender prover is already “ 100% PQ-proof, ” highlighting Ethereum’s unmatched ability to adapt to emerging threats while maintaining its position as the global financial settlement layer. Foundation Plans Comprehensive Roadmap Release The Ethereum Foundation will publish detailed strategic guidance on pq.ethereum.org covering full transition planning to achieve zero loss of funds and zero downtime over the coming years. Drake highlighted recent artificial intelligence breakthroughs in formal proof generation, noting that specialized mathematics AI recently completed one of the hardest lemmas in hash-based SNARK foundations in a single eight-hour run costing $200.

Over the past year, Ripple has advanced through regulatory, institutional, and infrastructure milestones that collectively reshaped how XRP fits into global finance. These changes did not rely on speculation or promises. They emerged from executed deals, formal approvals, and expanding real-world use cases that now demand closer examination. A recent timeline shared by Cryptoinsightuk on X brings these developments into sharp focus, tracing Ripple’s strategic progress from mid-2025 through early 2026. The timeline highlights how legal clarity, acquisitions, and institutional integrations converged to redefine XRP’s market position. Take note $XRP holders https://t.co/bBhdUzqIJD pic.twitter.com/kya84rprcw — Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk) January 23, 2026 Legal Resolution Removes the Primary Constraint In August 2025, Ripple secured the final resolution of its long-running SEC lawsuit. This outcome eliminated the most significant regulatory barrier facing XRP in the United States. With legal uncertainty resolved, regulators moved forward on spot XRP ETF applications. By November 2025, multiple spot XRP ETFs launched across major exchanges, opening compliant access for institutional and traditional investors and shifting XRP into a regulated investment category. Ripple Expands Through Targeted Acquisitions Ripple paired regulatory progress with aggressive expansion. In September 2025, it acquired Rail for $200 million , integrating approximately 40 additional payment licenses into Ripple Payments. This move unified cross-border payments, FX, and stablecoin settlement under a single compliant infrastructure. The company followed with a $1 billion acquisition of G Treasury in October 2025. This deal pushed Ripple into corporate treasury management, adding cash management and FX hedging tools designed for enterprise clients. Ripple also strengthened its custody stack by acquiring Palisade, extending wallet-as-a-service technology for institutional users. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 RLUSD Becomes a Settlement Layer for Tokenized Assets RLUSD emerged as a central pillar of Ripple’s strategy in 2025. In September, institutions such as Franklin Templeton, DBS, and Securitize integrated RLUSD as a settlement asset. This enabled its use in tokenized funds, including BlackRock’s BUIDL and Franklin Templeton’s on-chain products. These integrations positioned RLUSD as a functional settlement infrastructure rather than a passive stablecoin. By December 2025, Ripple expanded RLUSD into Ethereum Layer-2 networks, including Optimism and Base, using standardized cross-chain frameworks to support high-frequency transactions and liquidity. Institutional Capital and Banking Ambitions Take Shape Institutional confidence deepened when Fortress and Citadel participated in a $500 million investment round into Ripple, bringing major Wall Street firms directly into its ownership structure. In early 2026, Ripple advanced its banking ambitions by filing for a U.S. OCC bank charter and securing UK regulatory approvals from the FCA. These steps positioned Ripple to operate closer to the core of traditional financial systems. Taken together, the developments outlined by Cryptoinsightuk point to a consistent pattern. Ripple has methodically aligned XRP with regulated finance, institutional capital, and tokenized asset infrastructure. For XRP holders, the message is clear. The conversation has shifted from potential to positioning. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The regulator filed a joint stipulation to dismiss the case with prejudice, meaning it cannot be refiled. The decision followed the return of funds to Gemini Earn users through the Genesis Global Capital bankruptcy process. Gemini Earn allowed customers to lend crypto to Genesis in exchange for interest, before withdrawals were halted during the 2022 market downturn. The SEC sued Gemini and Genesis in January 2023, alleging the Earn program amounted to an unregistered securities offering. The case became one of several high-profile enforcement actions launched after a series of crypto collapses triggered investor losses across the sector. Gemini Earn Case Tied to Genesis Collapse Genesis froze withdrawals in November 2022, shortly after the collapse of FTX, citing liquidity issues. At the time, Gemini said roughly $940 million belonging to Earn customers was locked on the platform. The freeze left thousands of retail users unable to access their funds and sparked legal and regulatory scrutiny. As a result, Genesis filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January 2023. The bankruptcy process became central to determining whether Earn users could recover their crypto. Over time, Genesis reached agreements with creditors that enabled distributions of digital assets rather than cash equivalents. Between May and June 2024, Earn customers received full recoveries of their crypto assets, returned in kind. The SEC later cited the completion of this recovery process as a key factor in deciding to end its case against Gemini. Regulatory Pressure Builds, Then Eases While the SEC dropped its claims against Gemini , Genesis resolved its own dispute with the regulator earlier. In March 2024, Genesis agreed to a final judgment that included a $21 million civil penalty and a permanent injunction, without admitting or denying the allegations. The Gemini dismissal comes as the SEC faces growing pressure over its approach to crypto enforcement. Courts have pushed back on several agency arguments, while policymakers debate clearer rules for digital asset products, including lending and yield programs. For Gemini, the end of the lawsuit removes a major legal overhang tied to one of the industry’s most damaging failures. However, the case leaves broader questions unresolved about how crypto lending products should be regulated in the United States and where the line falls between securities offerings and financial services products.

The two organizations signed a memorandum of understanding to strengthen Solana’s local ecosystem and expand institutional-ready products tied to the blockchain network. Consequently, the deal signals growing interest from major Korean financial firms as crypto adoption rises and regulators sharpen their approach to oversight. Hanwha Targets Solana Education and Product Growth Under the agreement , Hanwha will support training efforts around Solana’s development tools and broader ecosystem. Additionally, the firm plans to explore Solana-based exchange-traded products as it builds regulated options for investors. Hanwha also intends to publish custody guidelines designed for Solana-linked assets. Hence, the partnership aims to improve operational standards as institutions seek safer entry points. The company framed the collaboration as a step toward building a stronger digital asset foundation inside Korea’s fast-moving market. Moreover, the Solana Foundation plans to support adoption efforts through deeper ties with local financial infrastructure. Solana Foundation Flags Korea as a Priority Market Solana Foundation President Lily Liu described South Korea as a strategic market for global crypto growth. She said, “Korea is emerging as a key market for global crypto adoption, where regulatory clarity, institutional infrastructure and world-class developer talent converge.” Liu also explained the role the partnership could play in expanding the network’s reach. She said, “This MOU bridges the trusted infrastructure of a leading conglomerate with the innovation of the Solana ecosystem, enabling digital asset innovation to scale globally through Hanwha’s international network.” Significantly, her comments show how Solana views institutional partnerships as a pathway to larger adoption. ETFs and Local Momentum Build the Case Solana’s growth in the exchange-traded market has added momentum to the project’s institutional push. In the United States, Solana exchange-traded funds began trading in late 2025. This rollout started with the Bitwise Solana Staking ETF in October. Eight Solana-linked ETFs now trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Their combined assets under management have surpassed $1 billion in just over two months. Meanwhile, Hanwha has positioned itself as an early mover in Korea’s asset management space for digital assets. Between 2020 and 2021, it formed a dedicated digital asset team and published research. Additionally, the firm created a Digital Asset Business Team last year under its chief marketing officer. Hanwha’s chief marketing officer, Choi Young-jin, said the talks with Liu shaped the agreement. He also said the firm plans to build digital income-focused business models around Solana. Consequently, both sides appear to be aligning for a longer-term expansion in Korea.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-24 14:10:54

At the same time, the underlying asset’s price has tumbled by double digits over the past week or so and is currently struggling below a few key levels that could lead to even more retracements. Whales and ETF Investors Reduce Holdings Citing data from Santiment, Martinez posted on X a chart indicating that whales’ ETH holdings actually increased slightly at the start of the new year, going toward 31 million tokens. However, it has been mostly downhill since then, with the number plummeting to just over 29 million as of January 23. This means that they have “redistributed 1.63 million Ethereum (ETH)” since 2026 started, Martinez said . The situation with the spot Ethereum ETFs is similarly disturbing. The funds attracted over $400 million by January 6, lost a similar amount by January 9, and then went on an impressive five-day streak in the middle of the month, gaining nearly $500 million. However, the previous shorter trading week saw over $600 million being pulled out, with the total cumulative net inflows dropping to $12.30 billion – the lowest levels since mid-August.

It started 2026 with an impressive run that drove it above $3,300 within a week and to over $3,400 within two weeks. However, it followed the broader market’s performance and slumped beneath the crucial $3,000 support, where it currently struggles. Further data from Martinez suggests the asset needs to reclaim the $3,085 level to stage a more pronounced bullish breakout. For now, though, ETH remains miles below it. $3,085.

Together, the signals point to pressure on late buyers and a market testing whether it can stabilize after the latest drop. Bitcoin aNUPL returns to post bear market zone Bitcoin’s adjusted unrealized profit and loss indicator has fallen back to levels last seen near prior bear market exits, according to a CryptoQuant chart shared by analyst Darkfost on X. The chart tracks an adjusted Net Unrealized Profit Loss metric, or aNUPL, alongside BTC price from 2022 through early 2026. It shows unrealized profits and losses trending lower since the latest all time high, while price stays well above the 2022 lows. BTC: adjusted Net Unrealized Profit/Loss NUPL. Source: CryptoQuant / Darkfost Darkfost said the decline suggests many late arriving buyers now sit under heavier pressure than earlier holders. As a result, the post argues that unrealized profit conditions have weakened, even as Bitcoin trades in a higher range than earlier in the cycle. The analyst described the aNUPL as a smoothed version of NUPL that compares the realized capitalization of short term holders and long term holders against market capitalization. In the post, Darkfost said these levels often coincide with periods where holders either continue holding through drawdowns or sell into losses, which can influence whether the market shifts into a deeper downturn or stabilizes into a recovery phase.

Ted wrote that Bitcoin “could repeat the last two bottom structures,” pointing to the visual symmetry between past and present price action.

By 2029, ADAUSD could reach $2.19. By 2032, Cardano might reach a maximum price of $6.81. Cardano is a third-generation blockchain platform launched in 2017 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson. Designed for decentralized applications and smart contracts, it uses Ouroboros—a unique, energy-efficient Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. Cardano’s two-layer architecture separates transactions from smart contracts, enhancing scalability and flexibility. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, is used for transaction fees, staking, and governance, allowing holders to influence the platform’s future. Emphasizing a research-driven, peer-reviewed development approach, Cardano aims to tackle blockchain challenges like scalability and sustainability, making it a strong alternative to platforms like Ethereum. Perhaps you’re wondering: with its innovative technology, can Cardano’s ADA reach new all-time highs soon? Let’s uncover what the future holds for Cardano. Overview Cryptocurrency Cardano Token ADA Price $0.3586 Market Cap $12.92B Trading Volume (24-hour) $375.27M Circulating Supply 44.99B ADA All-time High $3.10 on Sept 02, 2021 All-time Low $0.01735 on Oct 01, 2017 24-hour High $0.3688 24-hour Low $0.3533 Cardano price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 5.79% (High) 50-day SMA $ 0.3904 14-Day RSI 44.28 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 25 (Extreme Fear) Green Days 13/30 (43%) 200-day SMA $ 0.6185 Cardano (ADA) price analysis Price is trending lower after rejection near $0.40, with ADA hovering around the $0.35 to $0.36 support zone Short-term momentum is weak with repeated lower highs and small red candles Buyers must defend $0.35 or risk a deeper pullback toward $0.33 Cardano price analysis 1-day chart: Cardano stabilizes near $0.36 after rejection at $0.42, eyes $0.40 reclaim ADA is consolidating after a sharp mid-January selloff. The latest daily candle on Jan 24, shows a mild dip, with ADA closing near $0.359 after trading between $0.358 and $0.362. ADA’s price previously spiked toward $0.42 twice (early and mid-January) but failed to hold above the $0.40 zone, triggering a breakdown into the $0.35 area. Since then, candles suggest stabilization and small rebound attempts. ADAUSD 1-day price chart by TradingView Key support sits around $0.35 to $0.34, while resistance is $0.37, then $0.39 to $0.40. Bulls need follow-through volume to reclaim $0.37. If $0.35 breaks, downside risk extends to $0.33. Holding $0.35 and flipping $0.40 would restore the uptrend in the coming sessions. ADA price analysis 4-hour chart: Cardano stalls near $0.36 as price compresses between $0.35 support and $0.37 resistance Cardano is drifting sideways on the 4-hour chart, holding near $0.3585 after an earlier sell-off from the $0.39 area. Recent candles show tight ranges and repeated closes around the $0.36 handle, suggesting indecision and fading momentum. Immediate support sits at $0.355–$0.350, where buyers previously defended long lower wicks. A break below could reopen $0.34. ADAUSD 4-hour price chart by TradingView On the upside, resistance clusters at $0.365–$0.370; reclaiming it would signal a short-term reversal and target $0.38. Until then, expect choppy consolidation with quick fakeouts. Trend structure still leans bearish with lower highs, so bulls need a clean higher low and strong breakout to flip bias.

Cardano appears to be entering a consolidation phase after recent volatility, with price hovering around the $0.35–$0.36 region. Bulls are attempting to defend this zone, which has acted as short-term support, while sellers remain active near $0.37. If ADA holds above $0.35, a rebound toward $0.38–$0.40 could follow, especially if broader market sentiment improves. However, a decisive breakdown below $0.35 would expose downside risk toward $0.33. Momentum indicators likely remain neutral to slightly bearish, suggesting traders should watch for volume expansion and a clear directional breakout before positioning aggressively. Why is Cardano down today? Cardano is down mainly due to short-term selling pressure after failing to hold recent rebound levels near the $0.40–$0.42 zone. The charts show lower highs followed by consecutive red candles, suggesting traders are taking profits and momentum has weakened. Price is hovering around the $0.35–$0.36 area, which signals fading bullish conviction after earlier attempts to recover. Broader market softness is also likely adding pressure, as altcoins often track Bitcoin and Ethereum moves. Without a strong breakout catalyst, ADA appears stuck in a corrective phase while buyers wait for clearer support confirmation. Is Cardano a good investment? Cardano (ADA) presents a mixed investment opportunity. It is a third-generation blockchain that aims to solve scalability issues and enhance security through its Proof-of-Stake mechanism. While some analysts predict significant price increases by 2030, others caution that it remains a high-risk investment due to the volatile nature of the crypto market. Investors should consider their risk tolerance and research before investing, as Cardano’s future performance is uncertain and contingent on market conditions and technological advancements. Will Cardano recover? Cardano’s recovery potential depends on market sentiment and adoption. Despite past challenges, its projected price increase in 2026, potentially reaching $1, has significantly bolstered confidence in the coin’s future. Will Cardano reach $5? Cardano hitting $5 seems quite achievable given past levels. With its ATH around $3.10, $5 would only need to beat that peak by about 60%. A solid bull run and some serious adoption could usher in a unit price of $5. Will Cardano reach $10? Cardano hitting $10 is a long shot. Its all-time high was around $3.10 back in 2021, so $10 would mean more than tripling that peak. From current prices, that’s over a 13x jump. While crypto can be unpredictable, that would need massive adoption and a bull run far beyond what we saw in 2021. Will Cardano reach $50? Cardano hitting $50 is extremely likely. With ADA’s current supply of around 35 billion tokens, a $50 price would require a market cap of approximately $1.75 trillion. Even in crypto’s craziest bull runs, that kind of valuation doesn’t happen for altcoins. What is the Cardano forecast for 2040? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2040 is highly speculative as it depends on multiple factors, including adoption, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and macroeconomic conditions. However, if Cardano continues its development in smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and blockchain efficiency, it could see widespread adoption, driving its price higher. Some optimistic projections suggest that ADA could reach double-digit prices, possibly ranging from $10 to $50 or more. However, in a bearish scenario, where regulatory hurdles and competition slow its progress, ADA could struggle to maintain high valuations. What will be the future price of Cardano in 2050? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2050 is highly speculative, but if blockchain adoption continues to grow and Cardano successfully scales its smart contract ecosystem, its price could see significant appreciation. What that number will be remains to be seen. Does Cardano have a good long-term future? Cardano (ADA) has the potential for a positive long-term future, primarily driven by its technological advancements and growing ecosystem. The platform’s unique features, such as its focus on scalability and partnerships with various institutions, position it well for future adoption. However, its success will depend on overcoming regulatory scrutiny and challenges related to developer engagement. Recent news/opinion on Cardano Cardano closed 2025 with major progress toward fully decentralized governance driven by the implementation of CIP-1694 and active community participation. The Cardano Foundation supported this transition through responsible voting power distribution, a complete tenure on the Interim Constitutional Committee, and extensive DRep activity. Delegation programs expanded with over 360 million ADA assigned to builders and adoption-focused DReps. Governance accessibility improved through open-source voting tools, educational resources, flow charts, and community events. Collaboration with Intersect strengthened committees across civics, technical steering, budget planning, and strategy. Overall, 2025 marked a year of maturation and unity as Cardano advanced its long-term decentralized governance vision. 2025 was a monumental year for Cardano governance.

By 2027, Cardano’s price could trade at a maximum of $1.60. Cardano’s historic price sentiment Cardano price history by Coingecko Cardano, founded in 2015 and launched in 2017, gained popularity for its eco-friendly Ouroboros Proof-of-Stake system and affordability. The 2021 Alonzo upgrade introduced smart contracts, boosting scalability and interoperability, driving ADA to its all-time high of $3.09 before dropping to $0.22 by mid-2023. In 2024, ADA showed volatility, peaking at $1.3264 in December before closing the year at $0.8451 after multiple corrections throughout the year. 2025 began with ADA near $1.09 but prices fell below $0.60 by March, then recovered above $0.70 by May and ranged between $0.51–$0.82 through July. From August to November 2025, ADA fluctuated between $0.74 and $0.96, showing brief rallies followed by pullbacks, with current consolidation around $0.80. In early October 2025, Cardano (ADA) traded around $0.78–$0.82, showing mild bullish momentum after September’s consolidation. Mid-October saw a decline toward $0.70, as selling pressure increased and market sentiment weakened. By early November, ADA stabilized between $0.68 and $0.72. In early November ADA traded around $0.61 — closing at about $0.609 on Nov 1 and $0.612 on Nov 2 . Over the next two weeks it held in the $0.58–0.61 range before gradually drifting lower. Mid-November saw modest strength, with ADA climbing to ~$0.53–0.56 before breaking lower around Nov 14. By Nov 20–22 the price dipped under $0.41–$0.43, reflecting broader downward pressure. In late November and early December ADA continued sliding — arriving near $0.38–0.44 by Dec 3–4, then trading close to $0.42–$0.43 around Dec 6–7. From Dec 4–Dec 31, 2025, Cardano traded mostly sideways between $0.42 and $0.48, dipping to around $0.41 mid-December before recovering and closing the year near $0.46 as buyers gradually regained control. From Jan 1 to Jan 7, 2026, ADA opened the year around $0.46, climbed steadily through early January, briefly testing $0.52 on Jan 6, then consolidated near $0.50–$0.51 by Jan 7, showing improving bullish momentum.",Crypto Price Predictions|ADA,EN,0,0,ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|FORKS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-24 14:25:00

If true, this could signal a notable step toward mainstream crypto adoption. However, KFC, Ripple, and major payment processors have yet to confirm the reports. The post on X, formerly Twitter, claims that select fast‑food outlets in Phoenix are piloting XRP as a payment option. This has sparked excitement in crypto circles, highlighting how rare direct cryptocurrency acceptance remains at major retail chains, outside of established payment platforms like Flexa, Coinbase Commerce, or Whitepay. If accurate, the sighting is significant because this development could accelerate XRP mainstream adoption by introducing everyday consumers to digital-asset checkouts. However, history suggests such initiatives are often limited or promotional rather than broad rollouts. KFC’s 2018 ‘Bitcoin Bucket’ in Canada, processed through a third party, serves as a cautionary example. Well, global crypto adoption at point-of-sale is rising, primarily through third-party processors and regional pilots. Binance Pay, for instance, has enabled thousands of merchants in markets like South Africa, including major chain outlets, to accept crypto, demonstrating how local operators can test adoption independently of a global corporate mandate. Conclusion Reports of XRP being accepted at select KFC locations in Phoenix are generating buzz, but remain unconfirmed. If verified, it could mark a significant step toward mainstream crypto adoption in retail, reflecting growing brand interest in digital currencies.

ETH tests support near $2,950 as traders watch $3,300 resistance Meanwhile, a daily ETH/USDT chart shared on X by That Martini Guy shows Ether trading near $2,950 after a sharp pullback from the $3,300 area. The chart marks $3,300 as a key resistance zone, with a higher supply band near $3,600 where price previously stalled. On the downside, the graphic highlights a support region just above $2,900, which price is currently testing after the latest sell-off. Ethereum USDT Daily Support and Resistance Chart. Source: That Martini Guy on X The structure shows Ether moving within a broad range that has defined recent price action. After failing to hold above $3,300, ETH slid quickly back into the middle of the range, then dipped toward the lower support zone. The analyst’s annotations suggest that a sustained move back above $3,300 would reopen the path toward the $3,600 area, while continued weakness could expose the lower boundary near $2,800. The chart frames the current level as a decision point. Holding above the $2,900–$3,000 zone would keep Ether inside its established range, while a confirmed break below would shift focus to the next marked support near $2,800.

The flagship cryptocurrency has been hovering around the $90,000 mark, as the market can’t seem to make a decision concerning the next price direction. As Bitcoin faced a mild sell-off, which, in turn, drove its price to fall from its recent highs, specific market participants were under severe pressure, including the miners. Interestingly, a recent on-chain evaluation has raised the possibility that miners’ stress might be ending soon. Miner Financial Health Flashes Classic Reversal Sign In a January 23 post on the social media platform X, market expert Axel Adler Jr highlighted that the Bitcoin miners might have started their post-capitulation recovery journey. The relevant indicator here is the Miner Financial Health Index (7D-SMA). Related Reading: Bitcoin Stuck In Bear Mode For 83 Days: Trend Pulse Confirms Structural Weakness For context, this metric tracks the balance between miner revenue and miner selling pressure. Hence, it reflects whether miners are net BTC distributors or accumulators. Simply put, the metric shows if Bitcoin miners are under pressure, stable, or even profitable. Capitulation events often reflect on the Miner Health Index as a negative value, as the amount of BTC spent surpasses the amount of BTC earned. On the other hand, miners are typically said to be in the recovery phase when the balance between revenue and spending starts to lean away from the negative. From the chart shared by the analyst, it is apparent that the index has taken on an uptrend, targeting neutral levels on the metric’s charts. History shows that the index does not merely target the neutral mark when it trends upward. Hence, if history were to repeat itself, the Bitcoin miners could be in for a rewarding ride, having survived the most recent capitulation event. Interestingly, the price of Bitcoin appears to have a directly proportional relationship with the Miner Health Index. Bitcoin Price Gathers Momentum As Market Condition Shifts In a separate post on X, Bitcoin Vector highlighted that Bitcoin might be garnering strength for a significant move in the near term. According to the analytics platform, this development coincides with the market exiting what was previously a “high-risk environment.” Bitcoin Vector explained that this exit from a risky market environment was last seen in April 2025, just before the bull run resumed. The on-chain analytics firm explained that we could be witnessing the late stages of a classic momentum bottoming pattern, which historically leads to large rallies. Essentially, there has to be one last push lower in price and, at the same time, a momentum boost to the upside, for the bullish signal to be completely formed. As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at around $89,830 with no significant movement in the past 24 hours.

Given the historical impact of tariffs or even their threat on BTC, it’s worth keeping an eye on the asset’s price moves over the next 48 hours. Minutes ago, Trump took it to Truth Social to warn Canada about the aforementioned 100% tariffs if Prime Minister Mark Carney strikes a deal to become a “drop off port” for China to “send goods and products into the United States.” He went even further, claiming that such a deal with the Asian giant could be devastating to Canada’s economic prosperity: “China will eat Canada alive, completely devour it, including the destruction of their businesses, social fabric, and general way of life.” The first reports about this “new strategic partnership” between Canada and China emerged about a week ago. The preliminary trade deal aims at reducing tariffs, including a commitment to import almost 50,000 EVs from China at preferential tariff rates. Before today’s threat, Trump withdrew his invitation for Canada to join his Board of Peace initiative after claiming during his Davos speech that Canada “lives because of the United States.” Bitcoin’s price has been severely impacted by even the mere threats of tariffs from the US against other nations, especially if they are supposed to be allied countries. Recall that just last week, after Trump announced new tariffs against several EU states, BTC tumbled from over $95,000 to $87,000 from Monday until Wednesday. It briefly dipped by a more modest $500 minutes ago after Trump’s statement on Truth Social, but more volatility could be expected on Monday morning when other financial markets open. BTCUSD Jan 24.

The last time that exit queues dominated was in December 2025, after reaching a peak in September. 976,509 active validators have staked over 36.3 million ETH, which is nearly 30% of the total supply, as of the time of writing. Source: Validator Queue Why is Ethereum’s validator entry queue congested? The rise of the entry queue has been fueled largely by institutional participants taking major positions in Ethereum staking. As of January 19, 2026, Tom Lee’s BitMine, the leading Ethereum treasury firm, had staked 1,838,003 ETH , which was worth $5.9 billion at $3,211 per ETH. BitMine now holds over 4.2 million ETH, which is nearly 3.5% of ETH’s total circulating supply. Lee, who is the chairman of BitMine, stated, “BitMine has staked more ETH than other entities in the world. At scale (when Bitmine’s ETH is fully staked by MAVAN and its staking partners), the ETH staking fee is $374 million annually (using 2.81% CESR), or greater than $1 million per day.” 73.57% of Grayscale’s ETH holdings are staked as of the time of writing. The asset manager has since become the first US Ethereum exchange-traded product to distribute staking rewards to investors in January 2026, with Purpose Investments set to follow suit on January 30. SharpLink Gaming, operating under the ticker SBET, has emerged as the first publicly listed company to use ETH as its primary treasury asset. The firm has generated over 11,600 ETH from staking activities since launching its Ethereum treasury in June 2025. Technical upgrades reduced barriers to entry Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade in May 2025 contributed to lowering the barriers for large-scale staking operations. The update increased the maximum validator stake from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH and also enabled automatic compounding of rewards. This has made it easier for institutional players to manage large positions without operating thousands of separate validators. With 29.88% of ETH’s supply now locked in staking contracts and the current annual percentage rate at 2.83%, the network faces a tightening of liquid supply. Analysts suggest this could support price appreciation, with some forecasting moves toward $4,000 to $6,000 in 2026. Critics claim that the concentration of staking power among institutional players threatens the very core of Ethereum, which is decentralization. However, people like Lee disagree with that take, as he believes that someone accounting for 10% of a system does not equate to them being in control of it. The leadership of BitMine has stated that they want to acquire more ETH and raise their percentage of holdings to 5% of token supply. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

More optimistic forecasts propose potential highs approaching $700. These predictions assume continued development and moderate adoption increases. The cryptocurrency’s performance will likely correlate with broader market conditions. Potential regulatory developments in the United States and European Union could significantly impact prices. Technological improvements scheduled for implementation before 2026 may enhance network utility. Several specific factors could influence the 2026 Bitcoin Cash price prediction. Increased merchant adoption through payment processors would boost transaction volume. Integration with decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms might create additional use cases. The potential approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs could generate positive spillover effects. However, competition from other payment-focused cryptocurrencies presents ongoing challenges. Market analysts emphasize the importance of monitoring these developments throughout 2025. Comparative Market Analysis Bitcoin Cash occupies a unique position within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The table below compares key metrics with similar payment-focused cryptocurrencies: Cryptocurrency Market Position Primary Use Case 2024 Transaction Volume Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Top 30 Peer-to-peer payments 150K daily average Litecoin (LTC) Top 20 Fast transactions 300K daily average Bitcoin SV (BSV) Top 60 Enterprise blockchain 50K daily average This comparative analysis helps contextualize Bitcoin Cash’s market position. The cryptocurrency’s emphasis on low-cost transactions distinguishes it from competitors. However, market share competition remains intense within the payment cryptocurrency sector. Bitcoin Cash Price Prediction 2027: Mid-Term Projections Projections for 2027 incorporate additional variables including potential macroeconomic conditions. Analysts consider possible Federal Reserve interest rate policies and global economic growth rates. These factors influence investor risk appetite across all asset classes. Bitcoin Cash price predictions for 2027 typically range between $400 and $800. The higher end of this range approaches the significant $1000 milestone. Achievement would require substantial adoption increases and favorable market conditions. Technological developments expected by 2027 could enhance Bitcoin Cash’s value proposition.

The 2030 Horizon: Long-Term Bitcoin Cash Forecast Long-term Bitcoin Cash price predictions for 2030 involve greater uncertainty but follow identifiable trends. Conservative analysts suggest a price range between $600 and $900. More optimistic forecasts propose potential highs exceeding $1200. These projections assume sustained technological development and increasing adoption. The cryptocurrency’s ability to maintain relevance amid evolving blockchain innovations remains crucial. Broader cryptocurrency market maturation could benefit established projects like Bitcoin Cash. Several potential scenarios could influence the 2030 Bitcoin Cash price prediction: Mass adoption scenario: Widespread merchant acceptance drives transaction volume Regulatory clarity scenario: Clear global regulations reduce uncertainty Technological stagnation scenario: Limited development reduces competitive advantage Market saturation scenario: Increased competition limits growth potential Each scenario carries different implications for Bitcoin Cash’s price trajectory. Most analysts emphasize probabilistic thinking rather than definitive predictions. The cryptocurrency’s performance will likely depend on execution against its roadmap and market conditions. Expert Consensus and Divergence Cryptocurrency analysts exhibit both consensus and divergence in their Bitcoin Cash price predictions. Most experts agree that network fundamentals will determine long-term value. However, opinions vary regarding adoption timelines and competitive positioning. Some analysts emphasize Bitcoin Cash’s established brand recognition and developer community. Others highlight challenges from newer blockchain platforms with advanced features. This diversity of perspectives reflects the cryptocurrency market’s inherent uncertainty. Will Bitcoin Cash Hit $1000? Critical Factors and Probability Assessment The $1000 price target represents a significant psychological and technical milestone for Bitcoin Cash. Achievement would require approximately a 300% increase from current price levels. Historical data shows that cryptocurrencies frequently experience such movements during bull markets. However, past performance never guarantees future results. Several specific factors will determine whether BCH reaches $1000 between 2026 and 2030. Market capitalization calculations provide context for the $1000 target. At this price, Bitcoin Cash’s market capitalization would approach $20 billion assuming current circulating supply. This valuation would place BCH among the top 15 cryptocurrencies based on current rankings. Comparable market capitalizations exist for projects with similar utility and adoption metrics. The target appears achievable given historical cryptocurrency market cycles. Critical factors influencing the $1000 milestone probability include: Bitcoin market cycles: BCH typically correlates with BTC during bull markets Adoption metrics: Transaction volume and active address growth rates Development progress: Successful implementation of roadmap features Regulatory environment: Clarity regarding cryptocurrency treatment globally Competitive landscape: Bitcoin Cash’s position relative to alternative payment systems Probability assessments vary among analysts. Some estimate a 40-50% chance of Bitcoin Cash reaching $1000 by 2030. Others suggest higher probabilities during specific market conditions. Most emphasize that cryptocurrency investments carry substantial risk regardless of predictions. Conclusion Bitcoin Cash price predictions for 2026 through 2030 involve complex analysis of multiple factors. The potential for BCH to reach $1000 depends on technological development, market adoption, and broader cryptocurrency trends. While historical patterns and current fundamentals suggest possible achievement of this milestone, investors should approach predictions with appropriate caution. The cryptocurrency market remains highly volatile and unpredictable. Responsible investment decisions require thorough research beyond price predictions alone. Bitcoin Cash continues evolving as a payment-focused cryptocurrency with an established community and development roadmap. Its future trajectory will ultimately reflect both execution and market conditions. FAQs Q1: What is the most realistic Bitcoin Cash price prediction for 2026? Most analysts project a Bitcoin Cash price range between $300 and $500 for 2026, assuming moderate adoption growth and stable market conditions. These predictions incorporate current network metrics and development timelines. Q2: How does Bitcoin Cash differ from Bitcoin in terms of price drivers?

XRP Technical Outlook: $1.90 Support Tested as XRP Nears a Breakout Decision Technically, XRP price prediction is neutral as XRP is compressing inside a symmetrical triangle, formed by lower highs from $2.40 and higher lows near $1.87. The 50-EMA around $1.97 caps short-term rallies, while the 200-EMA near $2.02 reinforces resistance. RSI near 48–50 signals balance rather than exhaustion. XRP Price Chart – Source: Tradingview A confirmed break above $1.96 could open a move toward $2.05–$2.15, while a loss of $1.88 would expose $1.83. Until then, XRP remains in decision mode. XRP Trade setup: Buy on a confirmed break above $1.96, target $2.10–$2.15, stop below $1.88. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of BTC on Solana?

The video, which was entirely computer-generated, depicted former Kathmandu mayor Balendra Shah, former head of the electricity sector Kulman Ghising, and leader of the Rastriya Swatantra Party Rabi Lamichhane walking together. Many people thought a new political alliance was emerging when the video went viral on the internet. However, because the entire encounter was computer-generated, the three politicians never really met. Audio forgeries spread through social networks The fake video represents just one example of AI-manufactured content now saturating Nepal’s digital spaces as the vote approaches. The election takes place merely six months after violent demonstrations led by young people demanding an end to corruption. Those protests forced out then-prime minister K.P. Sharma Oli and left the nation’s political system in turmoil. Digital forgeries targeting well-known individuals have flourished as a result of this crisis of confidence. The Rastriya Swatantra Party’s vice president, Swarnim Wagle, has filed a complaint with the Nepal Police Cyber Bureau. A phony audio tape was made to give the impression that he had a discussion with the prime minister of India, which never took place. These audio fakes pose unique risks in Nepal, as demonstrated by Poynter’s fact-checking efforts . Voice messages travel quickly through family chat groups and social media, often reaching receivers who are unable to confirm their legitimacy. The unreliability of tools used to identify altered audio means that ordinary people have limited means of distinguishing between falsehoods and the truth. Attempts by the government to control the issue have frequently made matters worse. Due to their failure to register with regulators, Facebook, X, and YouTube were blocked by authorities during the demonstrations in September. The ban triggered more violence instead of calming tensions. Reuters documented at least 77 deaths and thousands of injuries during the chaos that followed. Officials eventually lifted the restrictions, but the incident showed why heavy-handed blocking doesn’t work. False information simply moved to harder-to-monitor channels. Nepal’s Election Commission has tried addressing these challenges through policy. Their 2021 “Policy on the use of social media in Electoral Management ” set initial guidelines. A new draft code of conduct for the upcoming vote specifically bans false information and fake accounts intended to sway voters. However, specialists warn that these rules need immediate updates for the age of generative AI. Questions remain unanswered: What exactly constitutes synthetic media? Should campaigns disclose content created with AI assistance? Who is held accountable when fake information spreads? Experts call for a coordinated response Without perfect regulations in place, specialists and monitoring groups are pushing for broader solutions. Poynter and similar media organizations recommend several steps: news organizations and fact-checkers should investigate every viral video like a crime, tracing its origin and demonstrating how they verified it. Political parties and candidates should promise not to use deepfakes and clearly label any AI-created material. Social media companies should establish quick-response teams familiar with Nepal’s languages and politics. Regular citizens should take a “ten-second triage” approach, stopping, checking, and confirming before they share shocking claims. The Nepal Police Cyber Bureau is already preparing for more advanced attacks on the technical side. SP Ray, an official with the bureau, said, “AI is getting bigger and being used in more ways. Soon we may see crimes and cyberattacks that AI makes easier. ” Ray also noted the technology’s relative newness might provide some breathing room. He believes AI tech is still in its infancy and is just being adopted by the public, so it may take a little longer to use it as a tool of destruction. “We are well-equipped to fight these crimes and threats, and we should be,” Ray said. He added reassurance: “Nepal Police can look into any action. The only thing that will take time to look into is attacks from foreign soil. “ Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

This high-stakes event, designed to stimulate on-chain activity, has already generated remarkable trading volumes, with the current leader surpassing 765,000 USDT in cumulative volume. The competition represents a significant initiative within the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, highlighting the ongoing efforts by major platforms to boost user engagement and network utility through incentivized mechanisms. Ave.ai BNB Chain Competition Mechanics and Prize Structure The Ave.ai and BNB Chain trading competition employs a sophisticated three-tiered reward system to cater to various participant levels. Firstly, a participation reward pool of 20,000 USDT is distributed among all users who achieve a minimum trading volume of 200 USDT on the BNB Chain via the Ave.ai platform. This tier encourages broad involvement rather than rewarding only elite traders. Secondly, a tiered airdrop allocates a 15,000 USDT pool to participants who reach specific, higher volume thresholds, creating intermediate goals for motivated traders. Finally, the most competitive segment is the leaderboard competition, where the top 200 traders vie for a substantial 65,000 USDT pool, with the ultimate winner claiming a grand prize of 10,000 USDT. Participants gain automatic entry simply by logging into the Ave.ai platform and executing trades on the BNB Chain network. The platform’s infrastructure then tallies all on-chain volume transparently. This seamless integration lowers the barrier to entry, a common strategy in DeFi to foster adoption. Industry analysts often note that such competitions serve dual purposes: they stress-test platform infrastructure under high volume conditions while providing valuable data on user trading behaviors and preferences. Strategic Context of On-Chain Trading Incentives Incentivized trading competitions have become a cornerstone strategy for blockchain ecosystems aiming to increase Total Value Locked (TVL) and daily active users. The BNB Chain, as one of the largest smart contract platforms by user base, frequently partners with leading DeFi applications like Ave.ai to maintain network vitality. These events directly impact key metrics watched by developers and investors, such as daily transaction count and gas fee consumption. Historically, similar campaigns on other chains like Ethereum Layer-2s and Solana have led to temporary but significant spikes in network activity, sometimes revealing scalability limits or introducing new users to advanced trading tools like limit orders and cross-chain swaps. The structure of this particular competition reveals a focus on sustainable engagement. By rewarding participation and tiered achievement alongside a high-stakes leaderboard, it avoids the “winner-takes-most” pitfall that can discourage broader community involvement. Data from previous quarters shows that well-structured trading contests can retain a notable percentage of new users post-event, converting competition participants into regular platform users. This aligns with Ave.ai’s stated goal of boosting consistent on-chain trading activity, not just creating a short-term volume spike. Expert Analysis on DeFi Engagement Models Financial technology researchers point to several proven benefits of such trading competitions. Primarily, they accelerate user education. Participants often explore advanced platform features they might otherwise ignore. Furthermore, these events generate extensive, real-time on-chain data. Analysts can study this data to understand market sentiment, liquidity patterns, and the effectiveness of different incentive models. For the BNB Chain ecosystem, a successful competition reinforces its position as a vibrant hub for DeFi innovation, potentially attracting more developers to build on its infrastructure. The transparent and automated nature of on-chain tracking also builds trust, as participants can independently verify their standing and the fairness of the competition—a critical factor in the trust-sensitive cryptocurrency space. Competition Timeline and Anticipated Finale The competition commenced in early January 2025 and is scheduled to conclude precisely on January 26. With the deadline approaching, Ave.ai has reported that rivalry for the top leaderboard positions is intensifying significantly. This is a typical pattern observed in time-bound trading events, where strategic trading activity often concentrates in the final days as participants make last-minute pushes to secure or improve their rankings. The substantial prize pool acts as a powerful motivator. The current leading volume of over 765,000 USDT demonstrates the high capital commitment from top contenders. Ave.ai has also highlighted additional resources available to participants, including access to an official alpha investment research community. This community provides on-chain data analysis and the latest trading strategies, adding an educational layer to the competitive event. Offering such resources is considered a best practice, as it helps users make more informed decisions, which can lead to healthier trading activity and reduce the risk of uninformed speculation. The platform’s multi-chain aggregation capability is a key feature here, allowing users to potentially source liquidity and opportunities across multiple networks, though the competition volume is specifically measured on BNB Chain. Conclusion The final days of the Ave.ai and BNB Chain $100K trading competition mark a pivotal moment for participant engagement and on-chain metric growth. This event exemplifies a strategic, multi-tiered approach to fostering DeFi ecosystem activity, blending broad accessibility with high-stakes competition. The transparent, on-chain mechanics of the contest and its focus on real trading volume contribute meaningfully to the BNB Chain’s network effects. As the January 26 deadline closes in, the intense battle for the leaderboard top spot not only highlights the competitive spirit within the crypto community but also underscores the effectiveness of well-designed incentive programs in driving sustainable platform adoption and user education in the dynamic world of decentralized finance.

Coinbase’s technical team typically performs maintenance during lower-traffic periods, though global operations mean some regions inevitably experience peak-hour interruptions. The exchange’s transparent communication about maintenance schedules reflects growing regulatory expectations for digital asset platforms. Furthermore, these procedures demonstrate Coinbase’s commitment to operational excellence in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency sector. Impact on Global Cryptocurrency Trading Activities The scheduled maintenance directly affects trading activities across Coinbase’s global user base, particularly impacting regions where the 3:00 p.m. UTC window aligns with active trading hours. European markets will experience the maintenance during late afternoon trading, while North American users face morning market interruptions. Asian markets encounter evening trading disruptions during this maintenance period. Historical data shows that major exchange maintenance typically causes temporary liquidity reductions across connected trading pairs. However, experienced traders often anticipate these events and adjust their strategies accordingly. Market volatility sometimes increases slightly before scheduled maintenance as participants position themselves for the temporary trading halt. Other cryptocurrency exchanges frequently experience increased trading volumes during competitor maintenance periods. This phenomenon demonstrates the interconnected nature of global digital asset markets. During previous Coinbase maintenance windows, competing platforms like Kraken and Gemini reported measurable volume increases. The cryptocurrency market’s 24/7 nature means maintenance scheduling requires careful consideration of global trading patterns. Coinbase’s choice of timing reflects analysis of historical trading data to minimize user impact. Nevertheless, some disruption remains unavoidable given the platform’s substantial market share. Users should monitor alternative trading venues during maintenance if immediate transaction execution becomes necessary. Technical Infrastructure Improvements and Security Enhancements Server maintenance enables crucial technical improvements that benefit users long-term. These scheduled updates typically include security patch implementations, database optimizations, and performance enhancements.

Following these practices minimizes potential inconvenience during essential infrastructure updates. Essential preparation checklist: Complete pending transactions before maintenance begins Note any open orders for post-maintenance verification Ensure two-factor authentication devices function properly Bookmark Coinbase status page for maintenance updates Identify alternative platforms for urgent trading needs Communication channels provide maintenance updates throughout the process. Coinbase typically utilizes email notifications, in-app alerts, and social media announcements. The exchange’s status page offers real-time updates during maintenance procedures. Users should monitor these channels for maintenance completion notifications. Historical patterns show most maintenance completes within announced timeframes, though complex updates sometimes require extended periods. The cryptocurrency industry generally maintains transparent communication during such events. This transparency builds user trust despite temporary service interruptions. Following maintenance completion, users should verify account functionality and report any irregularities promptly through official support channels. Historical Context of Exchange Maintenance Evolution Cryptocurrency exchange maintenance procedures have evolved significantly since Bitcoin’s early days. Initially, exchanges conducted maintenance with minimal warning, causing substantial market disruptions. The 2014 Mt. Gox incident highlighted the critical importance of transparent maintenance procedures. Industry standards developed gradually through collective experience and regulatory guidance. Today, major exchanges follow formalized maintenance protocols with advanced user notification. These procedures reflect the cryptocurrency sector’s maturation toward traditional financial industry practices. Scheduled maintenance now represents standard operational procedure rather than exceptional events. This evolution demonstrates the industry’s growing emphasis on reliability and user experience. Recent Major Exchange Maintenance Windows Comparison Exchange Maintenance Duration Advance Notice Primary Purpose Coinbase (Jan 2025) 3 hours 72 hours Server upgrades Binance (Dec 2024) 4 hours 96 hours Wallet integration Kraken (Nov 2024) 2.5 hours 48 hours Security updates Gemini (Oct 2024) 3.5 hours 72 hours System migration Regulatory developments increasingly influence exchange maintenance procedures. Financial authorities worldwide now expect cryptocurrency platforms to maintain operational transparency. Scheduled maintenance announcements demonstrate compliance with these evolving expectations. The cryptocurrency industry’s infrastructure continues maturing alongside regulatory frameworks. Future maintenance procedures will likely incorporate additional user protection measures.

As global markets revisit the efficiency of cross-border payments , earlier enterprise solutions are attracting renewed attention. One such solution has resurfaced, offering a timely reminder of how blockchain-based settlement can operate without traditional intermediaries. A recent post by SMQKE on X draws attention to a short animated demonstration of R3’s Corda Settler, first introduced in 2018, showcasing XRP as the bridge asset . The reappearance of this demonstration coincides with XRP’s renewed presence in enterprise blockchain discussions, prompting fresh analysis of its real-world utility. Demonstrating Atomic Settlement on Corda The video outlines a settlement process between two companies operating on the Corda network. As the beneficiary, Company A selects the currency it wants to receive and chooses U.S. dollars. Another Video Demonstration of R3’s Corda Settler using XRP. Watch. pic.twitter.com/MWlUB8S6Py — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) January 24, 2026 The system immediately retrieves a live exchange rate from a trusted oracle and updates the settlement terms. Company A reviews the proposal and applies a notary signature, ensuring transaction finality within Corda’s permissioned framework. The updated obligation then reaches Company B, the payer. Company B reviews the amount in its preferred currency, pounds sterling, while the system calculates the exact XRP required using the oracle-provided rate. After approval, Company B initiates settlement by sending XRP to a designated address on the XRP Ledger. Oracle Monitoring and Ledger Confirmation Once Company B submits the payment, the oracle actively monitors the XRP Ledger. After the ledger confirms receipt of the correct XRP amount, the oracle generates a cryptographic proof of settlement. The system automatically submits this proof back to the Corda network, closing the obligation without manual intervention. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This process completes the transaction atomically. Company A receives the USD-equivalent value, and Company B fulfills its obligation in full. The system finalizes settlement in seconds, reduces counterparty exposure, and eliminates the need for correspondent banks or prefunded accounts. Relevance Amid Renewed Enterprise Interest Although R3 has explored multiple settlement assets over time, the XRP-based Corda Settler demonstration remains significant. The workflow shows how a public blockchain can integrate seamlessly with a permissioned enterprise network while preserving compliance and auditability. XRP functions strictly as a neutral liquidity bridge , enabling value transfer without serving as a long-term store of funds. The resurfaced video has generated notable engagement within the digital asset community, reflecting sustained interest in XRP’s enterprise applications. As institutions continue to evaluate blockchain-based settlement infrastructure, this demonstration reinforces a practical takeaway. Years before today’s renewed focus on tokenized finance, XRP already demonstrated its capacity to support fast, verifiable, and intermediary-free cross-border settlement at scale.

Market analyst Xaif Crypto notes the change could take effect by Q2 2026, bringing XRP under the country’s Financial Instruments and Exchange Act (FIEA). Japan’s proposed classification of XRP under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act marks a major step in formalizing digital asset regulation. By clarifying compliance for exchanges, institutions, and retail investors, it reduces legal uncertainty and strengthens the trading environment. Concurrently, the nation is leveraging the XRP Ledger as the foundation of its emerging tokenized economy. If Japan classifies XRP as a financial product under the FIEA, it could set a landmark precedent for other cryptocurrencies navigating the country’s strict regulatory landscape. While most digital assets are currently regulated as crypto assets under the Payment Services Act, this move would impose tighter oversight, including exchange licensing, anti-money laundering rules, and stronger investor protections, potentially opening the door for major firms to officially adopt XRP. Why does this matter? Well, Japan is fine-tuning its crypto policies to balance innovation with consumer protection, aiming for Q2 2026 implementation. This proactive approach gives the market time to adapt to evolving compliance standards, while major Japanese banks accelerate adoption of the XRP Ledger, signaling growing institutional support for digital assets. Therefore, Japan’s recognition of XRP as a financial product could set a benchmark for global crypto regulation. With the U.S. and EU still debating XRP’s legal status, Japan’s approach may guide other jurisdictions in balancing innovation, risk management, and investor protection. This move also signals growing mainstream legitimacy for cryptocurrencies, reflecting the evolving synergy between blockchain innovation and traditional finance. Conclusion Japan’s decision to classify XRP as a financial product under the FIEA is a landmark moment for the token and the wider crypto market. By offering clear regulatory guidance, Japan protects investors while creating conditions that could draw significant institutional interest.

This analysis provides a data-driven TRUMP meme coin price prediction for 2026 through 2030, examining the complex factors that could influence its journey toward the symbolic $50 threshold. Market analysts globally are scrutinizing this asset’s volatility and its dependence on external political narratives. TRUMP Meme Coin Price Prediction: Foundation and Context The TRUMP meme coin emerged as a cryptocurrency leveraging the name and public persona of a prominent political figure. Consequently, its valuation demonstrates an unusual correlation with political news cycles and mainstream media coverage, unlike traditional cryptocurrencies tied to technological utility. Historical data from 2023-2024 shows extreme price swings following major political events, debates, and election milestones. For instance, trading volumes have spiked by over 300% during key political announcements, according to aggregated exchange data. This establishes a precedent for high volatility driven by non-financial catalysts. Market Mechanics and Liquidity Analysis Understanding the $TRUMP price prediction requires examining its underlying market structure. The coin operates primarily on decentralized exchanges, which impacts liquidity and price stability. Furthermore, its tokenomics, including total supply and distribution mechanisms, play a crucial role. A comparative analysis with earlier political meme coins reveals common patterns of rapid appreciation followed by prolonged consolidation phases. Market depth charts consistently show thinner order books compared to top-tier meme coins, amplifying price movements from relatively small capital inflows or outflows. Expert Perspectives on Long-Term Viability Financial analysts and blockchain researchers offer mixed views on the long-term trajectory of politically-themed cryptocurrencies. Some experts from institutions like the Digital Asset Research Consortium highlight the novelty and community-driven nature of such assets. They point to the sustained, albeit niche, trading communities that form around them. Conversely, other analysts emphasize the regulatory risks and inherent volatility that make long-term price predictions exceptionally challenging. These experts often reference the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s evolving stance on celebrity and politician-associated tokens as a critical variable. Key factors identified by analysts include: Regulatory Environment: Future clarifications on crypto asset classification could significantly impact accessibility and trading. Political Cycle Correlation: The coin’s price has historically shown sensitivity to election periods and policy announcements. Broader Crypto Market Health: $TRUMP does not trade in isolation; its price is partially tethered to Bitcoin and Ethereum market trends. Community Engagement: The size and activity of the holder community directly influence trading volume and price support levels. Price Forecast Framework: 2026 to 2030 Scenarios Constructing a TRUMP price prediction involves modeling multiple scenarios based on different assumptions about market adoption, regulatory outcomes, and political developments. The following table outlines potential annual average price ranges under conservative, moderate, and optimistic conditions, synthesized from several algorithmic and sentiment analysis models. Year Conservative Scenario Moderate Scenario Optimistic Scenario Primary Driver 2026 $5 – $12 $10 – $22 $18 – $35 Post-election sentiment, crypto market cycle 2027 $8 – $15 $15 – $28 $25 – $45 Regulatory clarity, exchange listings 2028 $10 – $18 $18 – $32 $30 – $50+ Mainstream media attention, community growth 2029 $12 – $20 $20 – $38 $35 – $60+ Technological integration, broader adoption 2030 $15 – $25 $25 – $45 $40 – $75+ Long-term holder consolidation, macro trends These scenarios are not financial advice but analytical frameworks based on extrapolated volatility, historical beta relative to Bitcoin, and projected community metrics. The path to $50, therefore, appears most plausible under a sustained optimistic scenario combining favorable regulatory news, increased trading platform adoption, and continuous engagement from its core community. However, achieving and maintaining that level would require a significant expansion of the asset’s market capitalization and a substantial shift in its perceived value beyond mere political symbolism. The $50 Threshold: A Technical and Sentiment Analysis The question of whether the $TRUMP price can hit $50 is both a technical and psychological one. Technically, it would require a multi-fold increase from its typical trading ranges, demanding substantial new capital inflow. From a market sentiment perspective, $50 represents a major psychological resistance level. Historical analysis of other meme coins shows that breaking such round-number milestones often triggers increased volatility, with potential for both rapid rallies and sharp corrections. The asset would likely need to demonstrate some form of sustained utility or governance function to support such a valuation long-term, moving beyond pure speculative trading. Comparative Risks and Market Considerations Investors considering this TRUMP meme coin price prediction must weigh several unique risks. Primarily, the asset’s value is intrinsically linked to the public perception of an individual, making it susceptible to unforeseen personal or political events. Additionally, the broader cryptocurrency market’s maturity will influence all altcoins, including meme-based variants. The potential for increased regulatory scrutiny on politically-linked digital assets remains a persistent overhang. Finally, the innovative yet unpredictable nature of blockchain technology means new platforms or competitor tokens could rapidly alter the market landscape. Conclusion This TRUMP meme coin price prediction for 2026 through 2030 illustrates a path defined by high volatility and external dependency. While the $50 price point is mathematically possible under a confluence of optimistic circumstances—including favorable regulation, market expansion, and sustained community interest—it represents a significant challenge. The asset’s journey will serve as a notable case study in the longevity and price discovery mechanisms of politically-themed cryptocurrencies. Ultimately, its price will be a function of narrative, liquidity, and its ability to carve a niche within the ever-evolving digital asset ecosystem. FAQs Q1: What is the TRUMP meme coin? The TRUMP meme coin ($TRUMP) is a cryptocurrency created on a blockchain network that leverages the name and imagery associated with a former U.S. President. It operates primarily as a community-driven, speculative digital asset within the broader meme coin category. Q2: What are the main factors influencing the TRUMP price prediction? Key factors include political news cycles, regulatory developments for cryptocurrencies, overall crypto market trends, trading volume and liquidity on supported exchanges, and the growth and engagement level of its holder community. Q3: Is the $50 price target for $TRUMP realistic by 2030? Analytically, reaching $50 is possible but would require a specific set of optimistic conditions to align, including significant increases in market capitalization, sustained positive sentiment, and broader adoption. It remains a highly speculative target given the asset’s volatility. Q4: How does the TRUMP coin differ from other meme coins like Dogecoin? While both are community-driven, Dogecoin has achieved wider merchant acceptance and a longer history. The TRUMP coin’s value proposition is more tightly coupled with political sentiment and events, creating a different risk and correlation profile. Q5: Where can someone trade the TRUMP meme coin? The coin is typically traded on various decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and may be listed on some centralized platforms. Potential traders must conduct their own research to find current, reputable exchanges that support the asset, acknowledging the associated risks of trading volatile cryptocurrencies.

Consequently, the Bitcoin SV price prediction for the period spanning 2026 to 2030 has emerged as a significant topic of technical and fundamental discussion. This analysis will examine the critical factors that could influence BSV’s journey, including its underlying technology, market adoption, and the formidable challenge of reaching the $100 price threshold. Bitcoin SV Price Prediction: Foundational Context and Current Market Position Bitcoin SV (BSV), which stands for “Satoshi’s Vision,” originated from a hard fork of Bitcoin Cash in November 2018. Proponents champion its commitment to restoring the original Bitcoin protocol as outlined in the 2009 whitepaper. Furthermore, they emphasize its focus on massive on-chain scaling for enterprise use. As of 2025, BSV maintains a distinct position within the broader crypto ecosystem, often evaluated separately from its BTC and BCH counterparts. Its market performance remains tethered to developments in its core protocol, regulatory news concerning its associated entities, and broader macroeconomic trends affecting digital assets. Understanding this unique positioning is essential for any forward-looking Bitcoin SV price prediction. Technical and Fundamental Analysis for the 2026 Horizon A credible Bitcoin SV price prediction for 2026 must integrate multiple analytical frameworks. From a technical perspective, historical price action shows BSV reacting strongly to key support and resistance levels. Fundamentally, several factors will be decisive: Network Utility & Adoption: Growth in daily transaction volume and enterprise contracts building on the BSV blockchain. Regulatory Landscape: Legal clarity or challenges in major jurisdictions, which have historically caused significant price volatility. Developer Activity: The health and growth of the project’s developer community and ecosystem. Macroeconomic Climate: Interest rate environments and institutional cryptocurrency investment trends. Analysts from firms like CoinShares and Arcane Research often note that BSV’s price is less correlated with general crypto market sentiment than major assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum. This relative independence presents both unique risks and potential opportunities for investors considering a long-term Bitcoin SV price prediction. Expert Perspectives on Scaling and Utility Industry reports frequently cite the project’s claimed technical advantages, such as extremely low transaction fees and high throughput, as potential long-term value drivers. However, experts like David Schwartz, Ripple’s CTO, have publicly debated the trade-offs of such scaling approaches. A 2024 report by the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance highlighted that real-world adoption metrics, rather than theoretical capacity, ultimately drive sustainable valuation. Therefore, any serious Bitcoin SV price prediction must monitor tangible adoption data from sources like CoinMetrics and TokenAnalyst throughout 2025 and 2026. The 2027-2030 Forecast: Pathways to the $100 Milestone The central question surrounding the extended Bitcoin SV price prediction is the feasibility of BSV reaching $100. Achieving this represents a substantial increase from its typical trading range in the mid-2020s. This target depends on a confluence of bullish scenarios materializing over several years. First, widespread enterprise adoption for data-intensive applications like supply chain tracking or micropayments would need to materialize. Second, the broader cryptocurrency market would likely need to enter a new major bullish cycle, driven by factors such as ETF proliferation or central bank digital currency integration. Third, BSV would need to maintain or improve its technological edge and security without major controversies. Conversely, significant headwinds could impede progress. Persistent regulatory scrutiny, intense competition from other scalable blockchains, or failure to grow its developer ecosystem could suppress price growth. Historical data from CryptoCompare shows that BSV has experienced sharp rallies followed by prolonged consolidations, a pattern that may continue. A balanced Bitcoin SV price prediction for 2030 must account for this high-volatility profile. Year Key Price Driver Potential Bullish Scenario Potential Bearish Scenario 2026 Regulatory Clarity Clear guidelines boost institutional interest. Restrictive rulings limit exchange access. 2027 Ecosystem Growth Major enterprise partnership announced. Developer activity stagnates or declines. 2028-2030 Market Cycle & Adoption BSV becomes a standard for data notarization. Superior competitor technology emerges. Comparative Analysis with Broader Market Trends Evaluating a Bitcoin SV price prediction in isolation provides an incomplete picture. Therefore, analysts must compare its potential trajectory with that of the wider digital asset market. Data from Bloomberg and the Brave New Coin indices show that during altcoin seasons, smaller-cap assets like BSV can outperform Bitcoin significantly. However, during market contractions or “crypto winters,” they often face deeper drawdowns. The project’s focus on a specific niche—large-scale data processing—could shield it from direct competition with smart contract platforms like Ethereum or Solana. Alternatively, this niche focus could also limit its total addressable market. Monitoring the ratio of BSV’s market cap to the total crypto market cap offers a crucial metric for its relative success within any long-term Bitcoin SV price prediction model. Conclusion Constructing a reliable Bitcoin SV price prediction for 2026 through 2030 requires a multifaceted approach that weighs its unique technological proposition against market realities. The path to a $100 BSV price is not linear and hinges on the successful execution of its scaling vision, favorable regulatory developments, and sustained ecosystem growth. While the potential for significant appreciation exists, particularly in a broad crypto bull market, investors must acknowledge the inherent volatility and project-specific risks. Ultimately, the long-term valuation of Bitcoin SV will be determined by its demonstrable utility and adoption, making ongoing analysis of on-chain metrics and real-world use cases more valuable than speculative price targets alone. FAQs Q1: What is the main factor that could help Bitcoin SV (BSV) reach $100 by 2030? The primary factor would be substantial, verifiable enterprise adoption of its blockchain for high-volume data applications, proving its scaling claims and generating sustained network demand. Q2: How does BSV’s technology differ from Bitcoin (BTC), and why does it matter for price? BSV focuses on massively scaling block size to facilitate low-cost microtransactions and data logging, adhering to a specific interpretation of Satoshi’s original plan. This differentiation matters because its value proposition is tied directly to utility as a data ledger, not primarily as “digital gold.” Q3: What are the biggest risks to the positive Bitcoin SV price prediction? Key risks include adverse regulatory actions targeting the project or its proponents, failure to attract a robust developer ecosystem, and the emergence of competing technologies that offer similar scalability with greater decentralization or security. Q4: Do mainstream financial institutions consider BSV in their crypto analyses? While major institutions like Fidelity or JPMorgan primarily focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum in published reports, specialized crypto research firms and some hedge funds do analyze BSV, often categorizing it as a “protocol utility” asset rather than a mainstream store of value. Q5: Where can investors find reliable data to track the fundamentals behind a Bitcoin SV price prediction? Investors should monitor on-chain metrics from platforms like CoinMetrics and Glassnode, review developer activity on GitHub, and follow transaction volume and enterprise use-case announcements from the BSV ecosystem itself, while cross-referencing with independent analyses.

The Ministry of Digital Development and Information said the money will go toward research on making AI systems work better with less power, training people from high school through university level, and helping businesses put AI to work. The announcement, as reported by Reuters, continues a pattern of AI spending that started picking up speed in 2023. Last year, Singapore put aside S$500 million for powerful computers needed to run AI programs in both government offices and private companies. The government also committed another S$500 million to AI Singapore, a program meant to build up the country’s AI skills from the ground up. Back in 2023, researchers working through AI Singapore built a language model called Sea-Lion, short for Southeast Asian Languages in One Network. As reported by Cryptopolitan earlier, the project cost S$70 million, and companies like Indonesia’s GoTo started using it. The team put out an updated version in October 2025 that works with Qwen, a system from China’s Alibaba, and handles languages spoken across the region, including Burmese, Filipino, Indonesian, Malay, Tamil, Thai, and Vietnamese. Region-wide push for AI dominance Australia put out its National AI Plan 2025 in December, setting up an AI Safety Institute and laying out plans to build more infrastructure and train workers. Japan moved earlier, passing a law in May 2025 to encourage AI research and development. The law created an AI Strategic Headquarters led by the prime minister. India joined in during November 2025, publishing official guidance on AI that marks the country’s shift toward formal rules on how the technology should be used. The rush of government action comes as companies worldwide spend heavily on AI. American firms, not counting the ones building AI systems, spent about $86 billion on the technology in 2025, according to market research. That number is expected to jump to $131 billion in 2026. But investors are getting pickier about where they put their money. They’re starting to see a difference between companies spending billions to build AI and companies selling the equipment and services those builders need. The ones providing infrastructure are starting to look like safer bets. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

The price increase will take the value of the HINU token from $0.00025636 to $0.00025735. The project’s pre-launch phase began on April 1, 2025. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market continued its broad decline, with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) recording only marginal gains, while altcoin momentum continues fading. The market cap is marginally down at $3.02 trillion. Husky Inu AI (HINU) Ready For Next Price Increase Husky Inu AI (HINU) is set for the next price increase of its pre-launch phase, which will take the value of the HINU token from $0.00025636 to $0.00025735. The project’s pre-launch phase began on April 1, 2025. The regular increases in the value of the HINU token enable the project to continue fundraising while empowering its growing community and existing token holders. The primary goal of the pre-launch phase is to secure capital, fund platform improvements, undertake market initiatives, and support broader ecosystem expansion. The project’s official launch is on March 27, 2026. However, the team is open to moving the launch to an earlier or later date. The project team will conduct a series of review meetings to determine the project’s launch date. The first two review meetings were held on July 1, 2025, and October 1, 2025, while the third is scheduled for January 1, 2026. Market Momentum Fades The cryptocurrency market extended its recent decline, with most tokens trading in the red. Despite the drawdown, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) registered marginal increases over the past 24 hours. BTC briefly reclaimed $90,000 on Friday, reaching an intraday high of $90,866 before losing momentum and dropping to $89,301. The flagship cryptocurrency is currently trading around $89,519, marginally up over the past 24 hours as markets settle into a weekend lull. ETH followed a similar trajectory, reclaiming $3,000 for a fleeting moment before dropping to $2,931. Ripple (XRP) overcame substantial selling pressure to register a 0.40% increase to $1.91. Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) registered a marginal decline to $127, and Dogecoin (DOGE) is down almost 1% at $0.124. Cardano (ADA) is trading around $0.359, and Chainlink (LINK) is down 0.50% at $12.20. Stellar (XLM), Hedera (HBAR), Litecoin (LTC), Toncoin (TON), and Polkadot (DOT) have also registered notable declines over the past 24 hours. Is Bitcoin (BTC) In The Early Stages Of A Bear Market? Analysts studying data from TradingView believe Bitcoin’s (BTC) drop below $90,000 has pushed on-chain profitability metrics into negative territory, indicating an entry into a bear market. According to CryptoQuant’s weekly newsletter, Bitcoin holders are transitioning from booking profits to realizing losses for the first time in over two years. The report noted that net realized profit/loss has fallen to 69,000 BTC over the past 30 days, indicating a substantial decline in market strength. “Bitcoin holders began realizing net losses for the first time since October 2023. Realized profits peaks have been declining since March 2024, an indication that prices are losing momentum as the bull market ends.” Annual net realized profits have also fallen sharply from 4.4 million BTC in October to $2.5 million BTC, levels last seen in March 2022. The decline reinforces the theory that on-chain dynamics are consistent with early bear market conditions.

In parallel, StorX has also enabled institutional access through Fireblocks , extending support to secure custody, treasury management, and transaction workflows used by regulated financial institutions, exchanges, and asset managers. The update was disclosed by StorX Network on January 14, 2026, positioning $SRX as increasingly compatible with institutional-grade digital asset infrastructure. https://x.com/StorXNetwork/status/2012136272450715836 Why BitGo matters for “institutional-grade” crypto BitGo is a long-standing digital asset infrastructure provider that positions its offering around regulated/qualified custody, governance controls, and operational workflows used by institutions. BitGo has also said it safeguards 600+ tokens across multiple chains and has built custody offerings designed for institutional requirements. For DePIN networks, where tokens are tied to real-world infrastructure incentives, custody support is often treated as a “plumbing” milestone : it doesn’t change the protocol, but it can make the asset easier to hold for allocators who can’t (or won’t) self-custody. Alongside BitGo custody, $SRX also offers broad self-custody wallet coverage, increasing operational accessibility for both retail and professional users. StorX’s official wallet support list includes D’CENT, Guarda, ELLIPAL, Trezor, Infinity Wallet, and ONTO Wallet, spanning mobile apps, desktop/web wallets, and hardware options. StorX has also published an integration guide for adding SRX to the Tangem app, extending SRX’s availability into another hardware-wallet ecosystem used for cold-storage-style custody workflows. On the trading side, $SRX is available on exchanges such as BTSE, Bitmart, MEXC, BingX, Biconomy, Bitrue, Coinstore, and Probit, providing liquidity across both retail and professional trading environments. Why this listing is strategically timed StorX positions itself in the DePIN segment through decentralized cloud storage , using token incentives to coordinate node operators and expand infrastructure capacity. With SRX now supported by a major custody provider, StorX can credibly pitch SRX as “institution-ready” infrastructure exposure rather than purely retail flow, particularly at a time when DePIN, as a category, is being tracked more formally by market data providers. For context, CoinMarketCap’s DePIN research has described a sector with hundreds of projects and a market cap in the tens of billions of dollars , alongside billions raised across the category, evidence that DePIN is moving from niche to investable theme for larger capital pools. What this could signal: SRX positioning for the next leg of DePIN market access From a market-structure perspective, custody is a prerequisite for several downstream channels, OTC facilitation, treasury holdings, fund mandates, and risk-managed storage for professional operators. By securing BitGo custody support, StorX can argue SRX is building the institutional “checklist” (custody → broader access → deeper liquidity), aligning with how other infrastructure tokens have historically expanded distribution. BitGo removes a major operational blocker , and that’s often how tokens transition from “tradable” to “allocatable” for institutional buyers. How StorX’s DePIN Model Operates At the protocol level, StorX Network operates a decentralized storage model in which node owners supply unused disk capacity to the network and earn $SRX rewards for providing encrypted, redundant storage services. User data is fragmented, encrypted, and distributed across multiple independent nodes, reducing reliance on centralized data centres and mitigating single-point-of-failure risks. End users, including individuals and enterprises, can access decentralized storage and backup services through StorX’s platform , while node operators are incentivized to maintain uptime and performance through protocol-level economics. This dual-sided model aligns infrastructure providers and storage consumers within a token-driven framework that is increasingly characteristic of the DePIN sector.",Industry Thoughts,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-24 15:26:20

According to market expert Crypto Bullet, this recurring structure could signal another major correction for BTC ahead. However, this time the leading cryptocurrency could give up almost a quarter of its current value. 2022 Bitcoin Chart Pattern Signals Over 20% Crash In his technical analysis released on X, Crypto Bullet revealed that Bitcoin is currently repeating a 2022 structure that could lead to a more than 20% decline in its value. To support his bearish outlook, the analyst presented a parallel chart comparing Bitcoin’s price action from 2023-2022 and 2025-2026, highlighting similar technical patterns, price behavior, and Moving Averages (MA). During the 2022 cycle, Bitcoin experienced a similar pattern, beginning with a test of the 100-day Moving Average (MA100) , highlighted as the blue trendline on the chart. After facing rejection at that level, the price pulled back to a nearby support zone inside a rising channel. From there, BTC staged a sharp rally, surging to fresh highs around $48,500, where it aligned with the 200-day Moving Average (MA200), marked in orange. However, the recovery proved short-lived. Bitcoin soon reversed course and failed to reclaim the MA200 as support. Once the cryptocurrency’s price structure was lost, downside momentum accelerated, pushing the price into a much deeper correction toward the $20,000 level. According to Crypto Bullet, Bitcoin is repeating this exact pattern in 2026. It has already retested the MA100, gotten rejected, and moved lower into a support zone within a similar ascending channel . The chart also showed that in both cycles, BTC reached a “market cycle top,” first around December 2023 and then again in November 2025, before breaking down and entering a consolidation phase . Given how closely Bitcoin is mirroring its 2022 setup, Crypto Bullet has forecast another dramatic price crash , predicting a more than 23.5% drop from its current price near $89,500 to $68,450. Before this decline happens, the analyst expects BTC to experience a short-term recovery , potentially climbing back above the $100,000 psychological level to reach $102,000. Bitcoin Could Still Rally To $92,000 Crypto analyst Tyrex has stated that Bitcoin has been consolidating for the past 48 hours, with price holding above $89,000 for most of that period. Despite the muted price action , he believes that BTC could soon rally to $92,000. The analyst also noted that the broader market is in a state of fear , with many traders anticipating further declines in Bitcoin. However, the analyst cautions that this expected drop may be a trap. He points out that an ascending channel is forming on Bitcoin’s chart, prompting him to adopt a more bullish outlook despite the prevailing bearish sentiment and sideways price movement.

Trump posted the threat on social media, calling Prime Minister Mark Carney “Governor Carney” in what’s become his ongoing joke about wanting Canada as America’s 51st state. He said Canada was “sorely mistaken” for opening its doors to more Chinese electric vehicles. “China will eat Canada alive, completely devour it, including the destruction of their businesses, social fabric, and general way of life,” Trump wrote. He said if Canada makes a deal with China, “it will immediately be hit with a 100% Tariff against all Canadian goods and products coming into the U.S.A.” This comes after Canada and China announced a big trade agreement last week. The deal lowers trade barriers between the two countries and rebuilds ties that had fallen apart. It’s a clear break from Trump’s trade policies. Carney traveled to Beijing last Friday and met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. No Canadian leader had visited China’s capital in eight years. Carney said China expects to cut tariffs on Canadian rapeseed, also known as canola. Canada’s side of the bargain? It will let 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles into its market at a tariff rate of about 6%, scrapping a 100% surtax. China will also offer visa-free travel to Canadians. _*]:min-w-0 gap-3""> Carney takes aim at Trump in Davos Right after signing the deal, Carney gave a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. He warned against coercion by great powers; everyone knew he meant Trump, even though he didn’t say the name. Carney took aim at using “tariffs as leverage, financial infrastructure as coercion, supply chains as vulnerabilities to be exploited.” Trump didn’t take that lying down. He accused Canada of ingratitude for American military protection and said the country “lives because of the United States.” Carney rejected that claim . There’s more. Trump withdrew an invitation for Canada to join his so-called Board of Peace just a week after Carney had signed onto it. Trump said Canada opposes his planned “Golden Dome” missile-defense project, though it’s not clear if that’s actually Ottawa’s position. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said this week that Trump had asked Canada to take part in the project. At Davos, Carney called on middle powers to band together to resist intimidation from great powers. Unclear terms and trade agreement details Nobody’s quite sure what Trump means by a “deal”, the Canada-China pact was basically a trade, focused on agriculture and electric vehicles. The White House didn’t immediately respond to questions. It’s also unclear what any change would mean for goods traded under the USMCA trade deal. Right now, goods under that agreement are typically tariff free, which means most Canadian exports to the US face no tariff. The current tariff for non-excluded goods is 35%, with different rates for certain sectors like steel and aluminum. Things between Washington and Ottawa have gotten ugly since Trump’s return to the White House. His decision to raise tariffs on goods from Canada triggered widespread outrage. Many Canadians are boycotting American products and skipping travel to the US. Canada has historically routed much of its trade south to the US. Now the country is aggressively looking to increase trade ties east to Europe and west to Asia. That includes sealing this trade deal with China and seeking new links with India—two countries that openly feuded with Carney’s predecessor, Justin Trudeau, in recent years.

The session, titled “SEC–CFTC Harmonization: U.S. Financial Leadership in the Crypto Era,” is scheduled for Jan. 27 from 10 a.m. to 11 a.m. Eastern at the CFTC’s Washington headquarters. It will be open to the public and livestreamed on the SEC website. The event will begin with opening remarks from SEC Chair Paul S. Atkins followed by remarks from CFTC Chair Michael S. Selig. A moderated discussion will follow, with the two regulators expected to discuss how the agencies can better align their approaches to digital asset oversight. Crypto journalist Eleanor Terrett will moderate the session. Doors open at 9:30 a.m., and in-person attendees must register in advance, though online attendance requires no registration. Atkins and Selig issued a joint statement ahead of the event saying the discussion will build on existing efforts to harmonize regulations and reduce uncertainty caused by legacy jurisdictional silos. They said unclear lines between what the SEC and CFTC regulate have long complicated compliance for firms operating in both securities and commodities markets. Regulatory Coordination: Past Efforts and Future Focus The Jan. 27 event follows a series of public coordination efforts by the two agencies. In September 2025, the SEC and CFTC held a joint roundtable focused on regulatory harmonization and clearer frameworks for crypto markets. Panelists at that session emphasized the need for clear rules to prevent firms from relocating innovation offshore and discussed topics such as 24/7 trading and innovation exemptions for decentralized finance. That same month, the agencies issued a joint harmonization statement outlining areas where coordination might improve regulatory clarity. It noted priorities such as aligning capital and margin standards, harmonizing product definitions, and considering coordinated exemptions under existing law to allow certain digital asset activities to proceed safely. The harmonization push reflects broader industry and legislative debates in Washington over crypto policy. The SEC and CFTC have historically operated with separate mandates — the SEC oversees securities markets while the CFTC regulates commodities and derivatives. Crypto assets often fall into both categories, prompting calls from stakeholders to clarify each agency’s role. What the Event Could Mean for Markets Industry observers see next week’s event as a sign of growing regulatory cooperation. Clear and aligned rules could reduce compliance costs and legal ambiguity for exchanges, traders and other digital asset firms. The discussion may also touch on emerging issues such as decentralized finance, perpetual contracts and 24/7 trading, which have been central to past coordination talks between the SEC and CFTC . The regulators’ approach to harmonization may influence ongoing congressional efforts to codify crypto law, including bills that would define digital asset categories and clarify agency jurisdiction. A coordinated framework from the SEC and CFTC could shape how lawmakers and industry participants view federal oversight of digital markets in the years ahead.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,COMMODITY|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-24 15:53:09

Li Yunfei, general manager of BYD’s brand and public relations division, announced the overseas sales goal at a media briefing in Shanghai on Saturday. The target represents an increase from the 1.05 million vehicles the company sold outside China last year. The push for more international sales comes as BYD deals with a tougher environment in its home market. Strong performance abroad last year helped the automaker claim the top spot globally for electric vehicles, pushing past Tesla. But now the company faces weakening demand in China as the government pulls back on programs that encouraged people to buy electric cars, and local rivals step up their game. The new target may fall short of what some financial analysts expected. Citigroup said in November that BYD was working toward overseas sales of 1.5 million to 1.6 million units in 2026, based on talks with company leaders. _*]:min-w-0 gap-3""> China Scales Back EV Incentives China’s electric vehicle market is entering a new phase this year with major changes to government support programs. Since January 1, buyers of new energy vehicles no longer get a full tax break on their purchases. Instead, they now receive only half of the previous exemption, according to CarNewsChina. Market watchers predict growth in electric and plug-in hybrid vehicle sales will slow down this year. Bloomberg reports that combined sales of these vehicles are expected to grow by around 10% in 2026, a sharp drop from the 18% growth seen in 2025. The Chinese government has also changed how its trade-in program works. New rules raise the minimum price needed to get the maximum rebate, which means cheaper models get less support. These adjusted subsidies particularly affect brands like BYD that focus on lower-priced vehicles. BYD and other Chinese electric vehicle makers now operate in a changed landscape. At home, they must work harder for each sale as government help decreases and more companies fight for customers. Abroad, they face barriers like tariffs but also see opportunities as major markets like Europe consider new approaches. Europe takes a welcoming approach The European Union is considering a new approach that would replace high import taxes with minimum price requirements. This shift signals improving relations between the two sides after months of trade friction. Under the European plan, Chinese carmakers would agree to sell their vehicles at or above certain prices instead of paying tariffs at the border. The pricing system would factor in government subsidies that manufacturers receive. Chinese brands have been making steady progress in Europe despite the tariffs. In November 2025, they held 12.8% of the European electric vehicle market. That growing presence shows Chinese carmakers can compete even when facing extra costs at the border. BYD’s rise comes as Tesla struggles with its own challenges. Tesla’s 2025 deliveries fell 8.6% to 1.64 million from 1.79 million in 2024, marking a second consecutive year of decline for the American electric vehicle maker. The drop helped BYD secure its position as the world’s largest electric vehicle seller . For BYD, the strategy seems clear. Grow overseas sales to make up for slower growth at home. Whether the company can reach its 1.3 million unit target, or push higher as some analysts predicted, will depend on how quickly these market changes unfold in both China and Europe over the coming months.

However, due to the impending 2026, analysts are doubting whether it has a valuation profile that gives them enough room to enjoy a significant upside. As XRP continues to border the 116B market capital mark, investors are rethinking the potential returns of the asset in the long-term and also considering new competitors that are about to undergo their initial utility cycles. Ripple (XRP) Ripple is trading at a value of close to $1.90 and its market capital is approximately $117B. Previously, XRP has gained substantial attention owing to its banking integrations, speed in settlement and regulatory transparency. That formed one of the most significant initial spikes in the history of large-cap altcoins and established XRP as one of the key financial assets in the payments sector. The present-day environment appears to be different. XRP is currently under resistance against the range of $2.10-$2.30. The asset has already tried to break through those levels several times, but it has not been successful without fresh catalysts. At this massive valuation base, analysts predict sluggish and tamed performance in the years 2026 and 2027. Even most of the long-term forecasts indicate that XRP will not rise by more than 15% to 35% percent over the same term. Although bearish, it has less asymmetry and a later stage profile of smaller tokens which have not been fully discovered in the price. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of the new tokens that are currently attracting attention of investors who owned XRP in the past. It is developing a decentralized lending protocol that has two markets which are borrowing and lending. The lenders in the pooled market provide assets and are issued with the mtTokens that reflect the position they hold and the amount of interest they have earned. Liquidity is unlocked by the borrowers when they use collateral at specified loan-to-value ratios. In the direct matching market, the borrowing is done on the same terms but without recourse to common liquidity. The initial distribution of Mutuum Finance was 2025, which was distributed at a price of $0.01. The token now sits at $0.04 in Phase 7. The project has already collected $19.9M and added 18,900 holders onboard. The total quantity of tokens sold out of the 4B supply is 830M. Out of that delivery, 1.82B tokens or 45.5% are subject to early access. The price will be introduced at $0.06 that puts the Phase 1 participants in a position that will reflect a 500% increase in their price since the time they join. Why MUTM is Viewed as Early XRP Analysts have discussed three reasons why certain investors feel that Mutuum Finance may end up following the progress made by early XRP albeit in a different field of the market. To start with, the two assets did not pursue a narrative but instead started with a foundation by building infrastructure. XRP specialised in setting systems and institutional rails. Mutuum Finance is developing lending infrastructure with collateral, liquidation and borrowing infrastructure. According to analysts, the infrastructure tokens are usually identified in the development process as opposed to realized. Second, the two assets were pegged on adoption preceding speculation. The most active steps that XRP took included the beginning of settlement flows through banks. Analysts predict that the discovery moment of Mutuum Finance will be its V1 when borrowing, data on APY and revenue will be visible first. Third, both assets utilized organized token models as opposed to open inflation. In its early development, XRP followed the fixed supply model. The fixed supply of 4B is distributed in phases with revenue-based acquisition and selling processes by means of mtTokens in Mutuum Finance. Analysts contend that it brings incentive excitation between token holders, lenders and borrowers. Signals and Factors of Participation Roadmap Phase 7 has been gaining more momentum than the previous steps. Analysts pointed to a recent whale allocation of %115K as an indication that bigger investors are placing before V1. Security has also contributed towards participation. Mutuum Finance was independently audited by Halborn Security and has a 90 out of 100 score on token scan by CertiK. Onboarding tools have been used to facilitate user participation. As part of the project, it has a daily 24-hour leaderboard which compensates the top contributor with $500 in MUTM. Card payment support is another area that has increased participation by reducing the barrier to participation by users who do not have crypto assets. The majority of investors who had previously received early XRP gains are now placing funds in assets with their first utility cycle. According to the analysts, Mutuum Finance meets that description because it is in the process of approaching V1 and stabilizing the distribution phase. To investors considering what crypto to buy in 2026 positioning, the lifecycle stage difference is the primary factor that has put MUTM on the comparison lists with XRP.

Presently, the altcoin is trading within a range of $155-$160, but an emerging chart pattern indicates an impending price breakout. Related Reading: XRP Price Recovery Is Possible If It Reclaims This Ichimoku Base AAVE Falling Wedge Nears Explosion Point, $145 As Key Price Floor In an X post on January 23, popular market expert Ali Martinez shares an insightful analysis of the AAVEUSD 4-hour chart, showing the altcoin is approaching a critical market juncture. Notably, a key support zone of $144 sits at the base of a broader descending structure that has defined AAVE’s price action since last year. Martinez’s analysis shows that AAVE is trading within a falling wedge formation, characterized by a series of lower highs capped by a descending trendline and relatively stable support near the $145 region. This price formation often represents a period of consolidation following sustained downside pressure, as sellers gradually lose momentum while buyers defend a key floor. For context, since topping out above the $350 level earlier in the cycle, AAVE has experienced a steady corrective move, with price stepping down through multiple horizontal levels near $240, $200, and $162. The loss of these zones shifted short-term momentum firmly in favor of sellers, making the current support range even more important. At present, AAVE is trading in the mid $150s, leaving limited room before a direct retest of the $144.93 support. However, this level has already acted as a demand zone multiple times during the current downtrend, reinforcing its significance. According to Martinez’s analysis, a clean break below $145 could force an accelerated downside move, with the next major support area set around $125. In that scenario, price acceptance below the wedge structure would likely confirm a continuation of the broader bearish trend. Conversely, holding the $145 support may provide the conditions for a technical rebound. A successful defense of this level, combined with a break above the descending trendline, could allow AAVE to reclaim higher resistance zones around $162 and potentially $200 over time. While such a move would not immediately invalidate the larger corrective structure, it would suggest improving market balance and decreased selling pressure.

Meanwhile, the daily trading volume is up by 6.07% and valued at $362.59 million. With price compressing toward the apex of the falling wedge, traders should expect increased volatility in the coming AAVE trading sessions. For now, the price moves at $144.93 as a pivotal inflection point for determining the next directional move.

In the world of digital assets, the path to building substantial wealth is increasingly defined by identifying foundational infrastructure projects that underpin tomorrow’s financial systems. Success does not come from chasing hype or speculative trends; it emerges from aligning with networks that solve real-world problems and scale over time. A recent post by XRP Update on X emphasized this principle, highlighting six cryptocurrencies—XRP, Stellar (XLM), Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR), Algorand (ALGO), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Flare (FLR)—as critical components of the infrastructure layer shaping the future of finance. The post underscores a straightforward yet powerful approach: build positions in these foundational assets, hold through market cycles, and allow time to compound potential returns. This is all you need to become a millionaire. The infrastructure layer of the future: $XRP $XLM $HBAR $ALGO $DOGE $FLR Build. Hold. Let time do the rest. pic.twitter.com/Ci2FaISfnn — XRP Update (@XrpUdate) January 23, 2026 XRP and Cross-Border Settlements XRP remains the cornerstone of blockchain-based cross-border payment infrastructure . Its high-speed transaction capabilities, low fees, and growing integration with financial institutions make it a practical bridge for global liquidity. By supporting tokenized assets and enterprise adoption, XRP strengthens its role as a foundational layer for institutional finance, offering both utility and long-term growth potential. Emerging Networks Driving Scalability Beyond XRP, networks like XLM, HBAR, and ALGO provide unique technological advantages. XLM facilitates efficient, low-cost global remittances and microtransactions. HBAR’s Hedera network delivers enterprise-grade speed and energy-efficient consensus mechanisms for large-scale applications. ALGO powers scalable decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions and tokenized ecosystems. Together, these networks demonstrate that long-term value stems from solving real financial and operational challenges. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community and Programmable Assets DOGE and FLR contribute differently but meaningfully. DOGE benefits from widespread adoption and community engagement, demonstrating the power of social-driven network effects. FLR enables programmable value transfer and smart contract functionality, integrating legacy blockchains and broadening use-case adoption. These assets highlight that infrastructure value is not solely technical—it also grows from community support, developer engagement, and real-world integration. Build, Hold, and Let Time Work The strategy articulated by XRP Update is simple yet profound: accumulate positions in robust infrastructure projects and allow time for adoption, regulatory clarity, and network effects to unfold. Historical performance across these ecosystems shows that early accumulation, combined with patient holding, can translate into exponential gains. Market cycles may test conviction, but disciplined investors who focus on foundational networks stand to benefit from long-term compounding. In essence, the path to potential wealth in crypto is less about speculation and more about aligning with durable, scalable, and widely adopted networks. XRP, XLM, HBAR, ALGO, DOGE, and FLR collectively form the infrastructure layer of the future—build, hold, and let time do the rest.

The social media company cut roughly 1,000 workers from its Reality Labs division last week, representing a 10% reduction in that unit’s workforce, according to CNBC. The job losses hit teams working on Quest VR headsets particularly hard. Groups developing Horizon Worlds, Meta’s social VR platform, saw significant cuts, and the company closed down some of its internal production studios. Expensive vision loses momentum Reality Labs will now concentrate more on wearable technology, such as its Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses produced in collaboration with partner EssilorLuxottica, and artificial intelligence initiatives, according to Meta. Beyond its first release, the firm declined to speak further. For a corporation that prioritized virtual reality only a few years ago, the withdrawal represents a significant shift. The current VR market began when Meta paid $2 billion to acquire Oculus in 2014. When CEO Mark Zuckerberg renamed Facebook to Meta, it signaled his commitment to building what he called the metavers e, in terconnected digital worlds where people would work and play. However, that vision has proven expensive. Reality Labs has burned through more than $70 billion in losses since late 2020. “I can see how it feels like a VR winter,” said Jessica Young, who makes content for Horizon Worlds as an independent creator. The company’s shift became clear at its Connect conference in 2025. Meta typically unveils new Quest headsets at these fall gatherings, but this time around, no VR hardware appeared. Instead, the company showed off its $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses , which feature a small built-in screen. “If Meta’s not putting out a new headset for another year or two, it’s going to feel stale,” Young said. “It already kind of does.” Meta’s technology leader, Andrew Bosworth, pushed back against suggestions that the company is walking away from virtual reality entirely. “We’re still continuing to invest heavily in this space, but obviously, VR is growing less quickly than we hoped,” Bosworth tol d te ch newsletter Sources. “And so you want to make sure that your investment is right-sized. ” Bosworth also shared a post from Palmer Luckey , who co-founded Oculus, stating that Meta still has the “largest team working on VR by about an order of magnitude.” Industry faces reality check Still, market watchers see bigger changes ahead. Research firm IDC noted in a December report that the Extended Reality market, which includes VR headsets, mixed-reality devices, and smart glasses, is going through a major shift. Jitesh Ubrani, who studies the market for IDC, sai d VR headset s ap peal mainly to a narrow group of video game enthusiasts. Regular consumers haven’t embraced wearing “big, bulky headsets” for extended periods, despite predictions from tech companies about a decade ago that they would. “The market has spoken,” Ubrani said. “There are certain niche audiences that will continue to use these headsets, but it’s not going to be broadly appealing.” Andrew Eiche runs Owlchemy Labs, a VR game studio owned by Google. He sai d th e industry made a mistake by comparing VR headsets to smartphones and expecting similar mass adoption. He called this a “strategic mistake.” Eiche also criticized Meta’s heavy promotion of Horizon Worlds, saying it made life harder for outside developers trying to reach Quest users. “We’re at the mercy of Meta,” Eiche said, adding that this “creates a situation where if Meta pulls back, we all pull back.” Meta’s cutbacks included ending a program that helped businesses use Quest headsets for tasks like employee training sessions. Sean Mann, who leads startup RP1, which makes software for accessing virtual worlds, sai d Me ta missed opportunities by focusing too narrowly on gaming rather than exploring wider uses for VR technology. Young plans to keep creating for Horizon Worlds even as Meta reshapes the platform into a mobile gaming service similar to Roblox. But she’s not excited about the mobile direction, saying the VR-focused version during the pandemic era had something special that may now be lost.

While short-term price action reflects broader market caution, Solana’s underlying activity tells a very different story. Network usage, institutional interest, and upcoming protocol upgrades are all accelerating, creating a widening gap between price and fundamentals as the market heads deeper into 2026. This divergence is shaping Solana’s near-term outlook and its longer-term investment narrative. Solana Finds Balance Near $126 After January Pullback Solana ended the session near $126.72, with daily trading volume around $2.74 bn and a market capitalization just under $72 bn, ranking the token #7 globally. The recent pullback follows a rejection near $147.50, with price now consolidating inside a defined support band between $124 and $127. On the technical side, SOL remains below its 50-EMA near $134 and 200-EMA around $136, confirming that short-term momentum has cooled. However, candlestick behavior has shifted. Recent sessions show smaller bodies and reduced downside follow-through, suggesting selling pressure is fading rather than accelerating. As long as $125 holds, the move looks corrective, not structural. On-Chain Activity Remains Firm Despite Price Weakness While price has softened, Solana’s network activity continues to expand at record speed. Key on-chain metrics stand out: DEX volume reached $107 bn, surpassing Ethereum, Base, and BSC combined in recent periods Stablecoin transfer volume climbed to $312 bn, highlighting real payment and settlement use Active addresses surged to 27.1 million, up more than 50% week over week Staking participation hit all-time highs, signaling long-term confidence rather than speculative churn These figures point to real demand rather than short-term trading flows, reinforcing Solana’s role as a high-throughput settlement layer. Real-World Asset Tokenization Gains Momentum on Solana Institutional adoption is quietly reshaping Solana’s positioning. Enterprise blockchain firm R3 is building Solana-native infrastructure focused on private credit and trade finance, while Coinbase completed full Solana chain integration, expanding liquidity access across major regions. At the same time, Solana has crossed $1 bn in tokenized real-world assets, supported by flows tied to BlackRock’s BUIDL initiative and rising USDC velocity. This shift is reframing Solana from a speculative trading chain into an institutional-grade platform for tokenized finance. Solana (SOL/USD) Technical Outlook: $125 Support Tested as $136 Comes Into Focus From a price perspective, Solana price prediction seems bearish as SOL is testing a rising trendline that originates from December lows. RSI remains subdued near 38–40, reflecting caution but not exhaustion. A clean break below $124 would expose $120.90, while a reclaim above $131.50 would signal renewed upside toward $136 and $141.60. Solana Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Looking further ahead, the upcoming Alpenglow upgrade, targeting faster finality and expanded block capacity, reinforces Solana’s long-term thesis. If fundamentals continue to outpace price, the current range may prove to be a positioning phase rather than a peak. Solana Trade idea: Buy near $124–$125, target $136, stop below $120.90.

The recent price action resembles a pullback within a broader range rather than a confirmed trend reversal, but the rejection at key moving averages and supply zones has shifted the short-term balance of risk toward further consolidation and possible downside tests before any renewed advance. Bitcoin Price Analysis: The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, the asset has rolled over from the $95,000 resistance band, which aligns with the underside of the 100-day moving average and sits well below the declining 200-day moving average. The prior ascending wedge that developed from the $82,000 demand region has now broken to the downside, and spot is trading around the former breakout and local support near $89,000–$90,000. As long as the market remains capped below the 100-day moving average and fails to reclaim the broken wedge structure, the broader picture favors a range between the $82,000–$84,000 demand zone and the $95,000–$97,000 supply zone, with risk of a deeper test toward the lower boundary if bounces continue to be sold. BTC/USDT 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour chart shows the breakdown from the rising channel that carried the asset from approximately $84,000 to the recent $96,000 high. After losing the channel support and the $90,000 intraday pivot, the price has found tentative support just above $88,000–$89,000, coinciding with the origin of the last impulsive leg higher. Momentum on the 4-hour RSI has rebounded from oversold territory but remains below prior highs, suggesting only a corrective bounce so far within a short-term downtrend. A sustained recovery above $92,000 would open the door to a retest of $95,000, whereas failure to hold $88,000–$89,000 would significantly increase the probability of a move toward the $82,000 daily demand region, or even lower. On-Chain Analysis The adjusted SOPR (aSOPR) and its 30-day EMA have been trending lower for several months, moving from clearly profitable territory above 1.03–1.04 to below the neutral band around 1.00. This indicates that realized profits on spent outputs have steadily compressed and that an increasing share of coins is being sold near breakeven, with intermittent episodes of realized losses when aSOPR dips below 1. Structurally, such a decline in realized profitability typically signals a late-cycle or post-euphoric phase in which speculative excess is being unwound and weaker hands gradually exit. If aSOPR stabilizes around 1 while price holds higher-timeframe support, it would suggest a healthier, more balanced market that is flushing out marginal sellers without broad capitulation; a sustained drop of the 30-day exponential moving average of the aSOPR below 1, by contrast, would point to a deeper profit-taking and loss-realization regime consistent with a more extended corrective phase.

57438273,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=901584,1769273744,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/57438273.jpeg,European investors begin pulling back from US stocks amid Trump trade threats,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trump-risks-10-4-trillion-investor-exodus-us/,"President Donald Trump’s aggressive stance toward Europe may be pushing away some of the biggest buyers of American stocks, even as he celebrates record market highs and predicts further gains. Trump said he expects the US stock market to double from its current record levels, which he takes credit for achieving. But there’s a problem. Foreign investors, particularly from Europe, have been huge buyers of US stocks in recent years. Their money has helped push market indexes to the records Trump likes to talk about. Now, his harsh words and threats toward European nations could drive these investors away. Vincent Mortier works as chief investment officer at Amundi SA, Europe’s biggest asset manager, handling €2.3 trillion ($2.7 trillion). He told Bloomberg that clients are asking to move money out of US investments. “We are seeing more clients wanting to diversify away from the US. We saw that trend start in April 2025, but it has somewhat accelerated this week,” Mortier explained. He noted that moving away from US investments will take time and careful planning. Investors need to decide how to shift from major benchmarks and protect themselves from dollar swings. The S&P 500 fell 2.1% on Tuesday after Trump’s tariff announcement targeting eight European nations. At stake? $10.4 trillion in US stocks owned by Europeans , with over half that total coming from those same eight countries now facing his threats. Europeans own 49% of all US stocks held by foreign investors, according to Hugo Ste-Marie, a strategist at Scotiabank. That’s enough to impact the market. To be fair, European countries probably won’t work together to dump US assets all at once. The real concern isn’t government action. But as Trump keeps making threats and insulting comments, money managers from London to Berlin to Madrid are getting more questions from clients about reducing US holdings. US s tocks no longer the o nly winner For many years, cutting back on US stocks would have been a mistake. American stocks did much better than other developed markets. But things have changed since Trump took office. As the dollar weakened and European spending picked up, global markets left US stocks in the dust. Last year’s winners: South Korea’s Kospi up 80%, Europe’s Stoxx 600 up 32%, Japan’s Topix up 23%, and Canada’s benchmark up 28%. The S&P 500? Just 16%. Canada’s margin of victory was the largest seen in 20 years The past three years saw Europeans expand their US stock positions by $4.9 trillion, a 91% increase. Walking away from that now would signal a major strategic shift. That includes both new buying and gains from rising prices, based on Federal Reserve data from January 9 that covers through September. Greenland’s SISA Pension manages around 7 billion Danish kroner ($1.1 billion) and has roughly 50% in US investments, mostly stocks. The board has talked about selling. So far, there hasn’t been much stock selling, though some pension funds like Denmark’s AkademikerPension are getting rid of US Treasury holdings. Trump has warned that large-scale selling would bring “big retaliation,” keeping the threat of financial punishment on the table. For some Europeans, his threats have become too much. “As investors reposition for a new cycle, we believe allocations to European assets could accelerate this year,” Raphael Thuin, head of capital markets strategies at Paris-based Tikehau Capital SCA, which manages over €50 billion ($59 billion). He said clients in Europe and Asi a br ing up this topic frequently. Right now, the threat to American stocks from Europeans pulling back is limited. But it adds another worry for a market already trading at very high values. “This is really an environment where you don’t want to be all exposed to US equities or US assets, especially not the dollar,” said Mathieu Racheter, head of equity strategy at Julius Baer & Co., which manages 520 billion Swiss francs ($662 billion). Canada sets a precedent There’s history here. Last year, Canadians pushed their pension fund managers to reduce US stock holdings after Trump said he would use “economic force” to make Canada the 51st state. At Davos, Prime Minister Mark Carney said countries need to rethink their financial ties with the US since Trump has turned that relationship into a weapon. “If you asked an economist what the textbooks say happens with tariffs, it’s that it would be difficult for the exporting country, but what we’re seeing right now, at least in financial markets, is kind of the opposite,” said Sebastien Page, chief investment officer at T. Rowe Price, which manages nearly $1.8 trillion. “It motivates domestic investments, and it motivates diversifying trade partners.” Daily ETF flow data shows there has been “little change” in foreign investor demand for US equity funds so far, JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote on Wednesday.

The price action is now testing whether the early-January rebound was merely a short-covering rally within a broader downtrend or the start of a more durable base. Ripple Price Analysis: The USDT Pair On the daily chart, XRP/USDT is trading just above the major horizontal demand zone around $1.80–$1.90 after being rejected from the $2.40 supply band and the declining 100-day and 200-day moving averages. The moving averages continue to slope lower, confirming a medium-term bearish bias, while daily RSI has cooled from overbought levels back toward neutral, consistent with a fading bounce. As long as the $1.80–$1.90 floor holds, the structure can still evolve into a basing range, with $2.20–$2.40 as the first upside threshold that must be reclaimed to argue for trend reversal; a decisive daily close below $1.80 would instead open room toward the October capitulation lows around $1.60 and, if pressure persists, the higher-timeframe lower demand zone near $1.20–$1.30. The BTC Pair Against Bitcoin, the XRP/BTC pair is hovering around 2,100–2,200 sats mark after a sharp rejection from the 2,400 sats resistance band and the cluster of the 100-day and 200-day moving averages. The pair remains locked in a structural downtrend, with each rally into the 2,400–2,500 sats area repeatedly sold and momentum failing to establish higher highs. The lower support zone lies around 1,900–2,000 sats, where a recent downside wick indicates some demand, but until daily closes reclaim at least the 2,400–2,500 sats region and the key moving averages, relative performance continues to favor BTC. A breakdown below 1,800 sats would confirm renewed underperformance and could extend the slide toward the prior major demand area closer to 1,500 sats.

The liquidations were of both bullish and bearish bets on the asset in one day. The recent trend of Bitcoin has been quite volatile. In the midst of all this volatility, a new project is emerging and rising fast. Currently priced at just $0.04 in its presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining traction due to the existence of its working protocol with real yield. This is the reason many experts are of the view that it can be the next crypto to explode in the market, providing users with a much smoother growth trajectory as opposed to the erratic market performance of the likes of Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s Volatility Creates Unsafe Conditions The recent market action illustrates the risks associated with trading top cryptocurrencies when one has a significant amount of money borrowed. The whipsawing action in the Bitcoin price has created huge losses for everyone, which proves that even seasoned traders are at risk of going broke in a short period of time. This isn’t a good environment in which one could create wealth steadily. It proves that the old way of hoping that the price will go up isn’t a good strategy at all. Nowadays, investors are looking for more substance in the projects they invest in. They are looking for assets with real use and returns instead of just looking at the charts. This makes Mutuum Finance a top contender for the next crypto to explode. Secure Early Gains with the Mutuum Presale The opportunity to get into the market is presented through the Mutuum Finance presale, where the opportunity is very clear. The project is in Phase 7, where the token is being sold for $0.04, a price that is going to increase to $0.045 very soon. This is, therefore, an opportunity that a small investor should take advantage of, especially if you consider that you can get 6,250 MUTM tokens with an investment of $250. When this token is launched for the first time on an exchange for $0.06, this amount translates to an investment of $375. This represents an increase of $125 prior to any market gains. This is why this crypto is considered to be among the top to buy before the start of its major growth phase. Earn Reliable Yield with Peer-to-Contract Pools Mutuum Finance enables the generation of passive income through its Peer to Contract, or P2C, technology. Users are able to add an asset such as USDT to a collective pool. This collective pool is then able to generate interest from borrowers. For instance, a user is able to generate a yield of 15% on a $2,000 deposit. This means that an individual can earn $300 just by providing that level of liquidity within a single year. The yield compounds, which means that the money earns more money. This is a safe and profitable return that cannot be had with Bitcoin. It is a key feature that provides value and reinforces the notion that this could be the next crypto to explode. Secure Investment with a Professional Security Audit Trust is essential in cryptocurrency. Mutuum Finance guarantees security by undergoing an audit with Halborn Security, a leading blockchain security company. This involved auditing all of the lending and borrowing codes to ensure that any problems are fixed. It also has a $50,000 bug bounty program to encourage people to find any bugs. This shows the team is serious about the safety of the users’ money. In the cryptocurrency industry, where many projects have failed due to security issues, this step is vital. It provides investors with confidence, and therefore, MUTM is more secure compared to other new cryptocurrency ventures, making it the best crypto to buy for the long term. The Clear Choice for Explosive Growth While the risks of volatility are a danger for the value of Bitcoin, the presale route taken by Mutuum Finance provides an immediate path to capitalizing on its value while the system of P2C provides a long-term source of revenue through its security system. So, if you’re wondering what is the next crypto to explode, then the evidence is clear. It is going to be MUTM. MUTM is building a robust ecosystem. The opportunity to get in on the lowest price is available, and it is soon going away as Phase 7 is filling up.

Notably, the premier cryptocurrency has taken on a consolidatory stance in the past day, as if to lend credence to growing hopes of some price recovery. However, a recent on-chain analysis points out that Bitcoin’s outward show of resilience might merely be theatrical and that the flagship cryptocurrency could be facing a dark future ahead. Bitcoin Enters 30-Day Cumulative Realized Loss Phase Since October 2023 In a recent Quicktake post on CryptoQuant, crypto education and research group XWIN Research Japan dissects the present on-chain situation of Bitcoin, with the center of attraction being the Bitcoin Net Realized Profit/Loss metric, which shows the leading cryptocurrency has recorded a net realized loss on a 30-day basis for the first time since October 2023. However, the losses seen in 2023 were short-lived and rapidly retraced, unlike the current decline, which is broader and more persistent, suggesting a possible structural shift in market dynamics. At this moment, it appears that investors are less-interested in “buying the dip,” nor are they looking to “HODL” through the Bitcoin price action, and are more willing to accept losses. For this reason, the market can be more plausibly described as being in a state of caution. It is, however, worth mentioning that the present phase does not necessarily precede a market crash. If anything, it reflects that Bitcoin may be entering a more volatile phase, independent of speculative frenzies. Realized Profits Signal Late-Stage Of Bull Cycle XWIN Research further reinforces the hypotheses by referencing the trend in realized profits. According to the market experts, Realized Profits peaked in March 2024 at approximately 1.2 million BTC, and reduced slightly to 1.1 million in December 2024. As of July, 2025, realized profits had sharply dropped to 517,000 BTC, reflecting an increasing exit of profit-taking activity within the market. But this pales in comparison to the lower 331,000 BTC recorded in October. The analytics group explained that this contraction occurred despite a rise in prices, thus suggesting an absence of deep upside momentum. The group further highlights that this is a telltale sign of a late-stage bull market, one which was seen in 2021-2022. In this period, realized profits slowly dropped before the Bitcoin price flipped bearish. More shockingly, the annual timeframe tells a similar story, with annual net realized profits contracting from 4.4 million BTC to 2.5 million BTC, just within October 2025 and early 2026. This is also similar to the phase that preceded the bear market of 2022. In essence, Bitcoin is in a transitioning phase, from a mature bull phase to a volatile environment. As of this writing, the Bitcoin price stands at $89,462.

History shows that early believers in transformative technologies can see extraordinary growth , often eclipsing conventional financial strategies. The key lies in identifying assets with real-world utility, network effects, and long-term adoption potential—qualities that distinguish lasting winners from fleeting hype. A recent post by Cobb on X highlights this lesson by comparing XRP’s performance over the past 12 years with the returns of major tech stocks. While early investments in companies like Nvidia, Tesla, and Broadcom generated seven-figure returns, XRP’s growth over a slightly shorter timeline illustrates the transformative potential of digital assets. According to Cobb, a $5,000 investment in XRP 12 years ago would be worth approximately $4.8 million today—a result that surpasses even the most celebrated tech stock gains. If you put $5,000 in XRP just 12 years ago you would have $4.8M https://t.co/Ppy1f5rxbl — Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL) January 23, 2026 Learning From Tech Titans Historical performance in tech offers perspective. A $5,000 stake in Nvidia 15 years ago would have grown to roughly $1.65 million, while Tesla would have turned the same sum into $1.45 million. Broadcom, Lam Research, Micron, KLA, ASML, AMD, Netflix, Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, Applied Materials, and Microsoft similarly delivered substantial returns. These examples demonstrate how innovation drives long-term market value. Yet XRP’s results highlight that disruptive assets outside traditional equity markets can sometimes outperform even these iconic companies. XRP’s Utility and Adoption XRP’s exponential growth stems from more than market speculation. Its core value lies in enabling fast, low-cost, and scalable cross-border payments . Financial institutions, enterprises, and payment networks increasingly rely on XRP for liquidity and settlement, reinforcing its practical utility. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This adoption creates network effects that drive long-term value, a dynamic similar to how early tech companies scaled by solving real-world problems. The combination of utility, speed, and growing institutional acceptance underpins XRP’s remarkable performance. The Power of Patience and Conviction Cobb’s comparison emphasized a timeless investment principle: early identification of transformative assets, coupled with patience , can produce life-changing results. Investors who recognized the potential of blockchain-based financial infrastructure and held their positions through market volatility have been richly rewarded. In conclusion, the contrast between tech stocks and XRP underscores the importance of foresight, innovation, and long-term conviction. XRP’s journey from a niche blockchain token to a widely adopted financial instrument exemplifies how strategic early investment in digital assets can generate extraordinary wealth. Cobb’s analysis serves as a compelling reminder: identifying foundational innovations and allowing time to work can transform modest capital into substantial fortunes.

In a post on X, David said that he started accumulating in October 2024, grabbing 12.69 million ounces, which is 1.5% of the world’s annual silver supply. No ETFs. No leverage. Just raw metal. Now, as you should know, shortly after that, silver started a monster rally that is still very much ongoing, along with its big sister gold, which is basically worth $5,000 right now, as Cryptopolitan reported live yesterday. The metals rally came right after the US equity cash open. Markets are now deep in a precious metals stampede. David says system is collapsing, crypto is a trap In his X post, David said: “Here are the reasons I invested close to a billion dollars in precious metals over the past six months, including the purchase of 1.5% of the annual global silver supply (12.69 million ounces). The global monetary system is about to collapse (The Great Reset, or Basel Endgame). The biggest credit bubble in history will soon pop ($300T).” David said $28 trillion in U.S. Treasuries were coming due in the next four years, and the only way out was printing “an obscene amount” of dollars. He blamed Trump’s tariffs, saying they were speeding up the collapse “by design.” Then he got blunt. “Gold and silver are the only meaningful life raft. Physical possession is everything. The whole world right now is a sophisticated game of musical chairs; the chairs are precious metals. Crypto is a psyop. Those who purchase will have no chair when the music stops.” David said real estate, stocks, bonds, and crypto would all drop in value compared to metals. He warned that the banking system was set up to take customer assets to prop itself up. “You have ZERO counterparty risk with precious metals,” he wrote . “I’m up 20% already on most of my purchases. This is not a drill. Your grandkids someday will either muse or lament this financial decision you’re now faced with. Don’t fail them.” Earlier today, David posted this:- “I’ve officially made more money in precious metals in a year than I did in in tech in 20 years. Everyone’s invited to the party. It’s still early. Really early.” Analysts warn silver rally could flip fast Back in 2022, David got removed from Entrata’s board after sending an email that claimed the COVID vaccine was part of a plan by Jews to wipe out Americans. CEO Adam Edmunds and other board members responded by trying to understand why those kinds of messages are written and said they would push back against antisemitism going forward. Entrata, the company David founded, builds software for property management. The platform combines accounting, websites, utilities, marketing, leasing, and more into one system. As for the trade itself, David didn’t share how much he paid per ounce. But given the price action, he could be up over 250% already. That puts him in Buffett territory. Berkshire Hathaway once held 129.7 million ounces of silver in the late ’90s. They dumped it by 2006, making a massive profit. Now it’s David’s turn. Rhona O’Connell from StoneX said silver’s rally is “self-propelled.” She said gold is getting support from global risk, and silver’s cheaper price tag is pulling in buyers. But she also dropped a warning: “As and when cracks start to appear, they could easily become chasms. Buckle up.” Demand isn’t all sunshine. Michael Widmer at BofA said silver’s fair value is closer to $60. He thinks solar panel demand peaked in 2025 and said industrial use is falling as prices surge. Traders are now watching the gold-to-silver ratio. On Friday, it fell to 50-to-1. That’s down from 105-to-1 in April. Silver’s outperformance has never been this sharp since 1983, according to LSEG data. In 2025, silver jumped 147%. So far in 2026, it’s already up 40%.",OP-ED|Silver,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-24 17:10:11

Naturally, Wall Street traders weren’t quiet either. Many pointed to calls made by the New York Fed to several big financial firms, asking questions about the yen exchange rate. But things aren’t so smooth in Washington. If Japan is expecting a clean team-up, good luck. The US Treasury and Federal Reserve aren’t even pretending to get along right now. And that’s not great if you’re trying to manage currency chaos. Bessent blames Japan bonds, not dollar strength While traders were looking at dollar-yen volatility, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent threw cold water on the idea of joint intervention. Instead of pointing fingers at exchange rates or the dollar, Scott said it was Japan’s own bond market causing the drama. Long-term Japanese government bonds took a hit on Tuesday after Prime Minister Takaichi Sanae called a snap election for February 8. Investors expect more government borrowing if she wins, especially since she’s pushing a two-year cut to grocery sales tax. That promise spooked bondholders. Yields jumped. Scottie said that’s what made the yen wobble, not US actions. So while everyone thought the Fed might step in, Scott was saying, in effect: don’t blame us. Now, keeping US Treasury yields low is a major goal for Donald Trump’s administration. That matters for everything from federal debt to mortgage rates. A strong dollar makes that harder. So, if Scott thinks Japan’s domestic choices are to blame for the yen’s mess, he’s not likely to push for joint rescue action. But he’s not just being analytical. He’s been locked in a growing fight with Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Bessent joins Trump in attacking Powell Scott used to bite his tongue. Not anymore. After months of nudging Powell behind the scenes, he joined Trump’s public push to dump him. In Davos, Scott went on record bashing Powell’s leadership. He took issue with Powell’s decision to show up at Supreme Court hearings involving Lisa Cook, a Fed governor Trump is trying to remove. “If you’re trying not to politicize the Fed, for the Fed chair to be sitting there, trying to put his thumb on the scale, is a real mistake,” Scott said on CNBC. Powell didn’t clap back. He rarely does. But earlier this month, he accused the Justice Department of using criminal threats to force the Fed into cutting rates, something Trump has wanted since day one. Powell hasn’t said a word about the yen, Japan, or intervention. He’s got bigger fires. But if Japan really wants coordinated action, someone’s going to have to make a call. And right now, there’s no trust between Powell and Scott. History shows rare but possible joint action Joint intervention doesn’t happen often. The US has only done it three times since 1996, the last being in 2011, after the earthquake in Japan. Even then, it took all G7 members working together. Japan last acted in July 2024, buying yen and selling about $35 billion, or 5.53 trillion yen. That was huge. But it was solo. Scott might not need the Fed’s green light if he decides to go it alone. He’s already shown he’s willing to break rules. Last fall, he directed Treasury to buy Argentine pesos, just to help President Javier Milei, a Trump ally, ahead of the election. That wasn’t about market stability. That was straight-up political. If he backed Milei, he might be ready to back Takaichi too. Problem is, the Fed still controls the mechanics if the US is going to touch yen. And Powell isn’t one to follow orders. If Scott tries to push a yen intervention without Powell, that’ll spark a way bigger fight. Basic economics: the Treasury can’t act without the Fed’s help in execution. If Japan needs the US to act, they’re not just watching the markets; they’re watching the drama inside Washington.",OP-ED|Federal Reserve|Yen,EN,0,0,ASIA|FIAT|REGULATION|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-24 17:24:17

Prices dipped while a whale quietly bought millions in XAUT, a gold-backed token, signaling a short-term move toward traditional hedges. Related Reading: Bitcoin Influencers Get Spotlight In X’s New ‘Starterpacks’ Whales Move Into Tokenized Gold According to on-chain trackers, one address moved $1.53 million in USDC into Hyperliquid to buy XAUT. Reports note that the same wallet had earlier bought about 481 XAUT, a purchase worth roughly $2.38 million. The address still holds close to $1.44 million in USDC, which suggests more purchases could follow. These moves were picked up on public blockchains and then flagged by analysts watching large transfers. This kind of action can matter. When big players shuffle cash, smaller traders often take notice and hedge their bets. The shift is not proof of a long-term trend, but it shows that, at least for now, some large holders prefer gold exposure over extra crypto risk. Whales are buying gold, not crypto. ~30 mins ago, whale 0x6B99 deposited 1.53M $USDC into Hyperliquid to buy $XAUT again. He has already bought 481.6 $XAUT($2.38M) and still holds 1.44M $USDC, which may be used to buy more $XAUT.https://t.co/0uV2kNEiD0 pic.twitter.com/rYA09b1OEn — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) January 23, 2026 Gold And Silver Hit Fresh Highs Reports say gold has been moving sharply higher, with spot prices climbing close to $5,000 per ounce in global trading this week. Silver also rose above $100 per ounce, with intraday gold prints near $4,988 before settling. Traders tie the surge to geopolitical tensions and the idea that interest rates may ease, which encourages money into metal-based stores of value. A weaker dollar has also helped. Market chatter points to increased demand as investors seek steadier places to park capital while global politics and policy choices create more worry. Bitcoin’s Price Action And Market Mood Bitcoin traded around $88,653 at one stage, slipping about 1% on the day and nearly 30% below its prior cycle top. That gap is large. It has market participants questioning whether BTC will stay the go-to hedge during times of high stress. Some long-term holders remain confident. Others are watching liquidity and macro signals more closely. Reports have disclosed renewed criticism from economist Peter Schiff, who argued that Bitcoin has underperformed versus gold since 2021. He highlighted the opportunity cost for investors holding BTC while metals climb to record prices. Schiff wrote on social platforms that precious metals are outperforming and that this weak run for Bitcoin weakens its role as a store of value in the eyes of some.

Deliver chips when demand explodes. Instead, they torched every bridge. When Donald Trump gave Intel nearly $9 billion and backed it as an America-first tech firm, everyone expected a full comeback. The stock jumped 120% in five months. Investors thought orders would roll in fast. They were right. Orders came. But Intel wasn’t ready. For months, Intel had been cutting production on older lines. So when AI companies needed processors, the company had nothing. They failed to deliver. The stock collapsed 17%, wiping out over $46 billion. Wall Street found out the hard way. Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein said, “The stock went vertical on vibes and tweets. In theory, they should be in place to capitalize on this demand, but they’re not. What a shame.” Intel wasted the AI wave with no plan and no chips Intel got flooded with demand from AI data centers. They couldn’t supply the chips. Chief Executive Lip-Bu Tan admitted, “I’m disappointed we were not fully able to meet the demand from markets.” Chief Financial Officer David Zinsner said, “It’s just literally hand-to-mouth, what we can get out of the fab and what we can get to customers is how we’re managing it.” Lip-Bu stepped in March 2025. But most of the mess started before him. Former CEO Pat Gelsinger had poured billions into new fabs. Problem was, no one had signed up to use them. Those customers never showed. At the same time, Pat shut down the exact tools and capacity Intel would later need. Intel lost $10 billion in manufacturing alone last year. Meanwhile, GPU makers like Nvidia and AMD kept climbing. Intel sat out. They didn’t build AI-ready chips. They didn’t plan for the shift. And they definitely didn’t expect the CPU comeback. In late 2025, OpenAI, Google, and Amazon Web Services realized AI models also needed more CPUs to run. Fast. Those were the same older chips Intel had just stopped producing. In July, Intel took an $800 million loss selling off older manufacturing machines. David told analysts, “Mostly older tools that we just couldn’t find a purpose for.” Three months later, those same chips were suddenly in high demand. Intel had no inventory and didn’t want to restart production. David said, “Obviously, we’re not looking to build more capacity there, and so as we get more demand, we’re constrained. In some ways, we’re living off of inventory.” Intel has no customer for its future tech and no timeline either Intel’s 14A process still has zero customers. Nothing. No deals. And the company refuses to build more facilities until someone signs up. So the timeline keeps slipping. Their top rival, TSMC, is already building new U.S. fabs while Intel stalls. Inside the company, leadership says to be patient. Lip-Bu is working hard to bring in a customer. But no one at Intel is promising any real announcement. Someone familiar with the plans said the company will instead raise capital spending on 14A later this year. That’s how they’ll “signal” a partner was signed. No names. No contracts. Just a hint. Lip-Bu admitted it’s a long road. “We are on a multiyear journey. It will take time and resolve.” That’s the best they’ve got right now. To cut losses, Intel said in July it would fire 15% of its workers, cancel fab plans in Europe, and delay its Ohio plant. David said Intel will increase tool spending again in 2026 to deal with the chip shortage. But Rasgon from Bernstein said :- “They either didn’t see the demand or didn’t believe it was real. They had an opportunity to provide a lot of supply and they didn’t. That’s disappointing.” Intel already retired the tools for its Emerald Rapids and Granite Rapids CPU lines.

A revealing 5-level scale now measures foundation model companies not by their current revenue, but by their explicit monetization intent. This framework provides essential clarity in an ecosystem where billions flow to organizations with dramatically different commercial aspirations. AI Labs Commercial Ambitions: The New Measurement Framework The artificial intelligence sector has entered a unique maturation phase where veteran researchers from major technology companies launch independent laboratories. Simultaneously, legendary academics establish ventures with ambiguous commercial goals. Industry observers note this divergence creates significant market confusion. Consequently, a new analytical framework categorizes AI labs based on their stated monetization objectives rather than financial performance. This 5-level scale ranges from purely philosophical research organizations to aggressively commercial enterprises. Significantly, the framework measures ambition rather than success. Each level represents distinct strategic positioning within the competitive AI landscape. Major technology analysts have adopted this scale to evaluate emerging players and established giants alike. Foundation Model Monetization: The Five Distinct Levels The classification system provides clear benchmarks for assessing AI laboratory intentions. Level 5 organizations already generate millions daily through enterprise contracts and consumer products. These include OpenAI with its ChatGPT ecosystem and Anthropic with its Claude enterprise solutions. Level 4 companies maintain detailed multi-stage plans targeting market dominance and substantial revenue generation within specific timeframes. Level 3 entities possess promising product concepts they will reveal strategically. Level 2 organizations have preliminary commercialization concepts without detailed roadmaps. Level 1 operations prioritize philosophical research over financial returns. This spectrum helps investors allocate capital appropriately based on risk tolerance and return expectations. Investment Patterns and Commercial Expectations Venture capital firms poured approximately $42.7 billion into AI startups during 2024 according to PitchBook data. Surprisingly, many investments targeted Level 1 and Level 2 organizations with minimal commercial infrastructure. This funding pattern reflects investor confidence in long-term AI potential rather than short-term returns. However, market analysts predict increasing pressure for monetization as capital deployment scales. The current investment climate allows researchers substantial freedom in commercial positioning. Major funding rounds frequently occur without detailed business plans or revenue projections. This environment enables pure research but creates valuation challenges for later-stage investors. Consequently, the 5-level scale provides essential transparency for secondary market participants. Emerging AI Labs: Case Studies in Commercial Positioning Several prominent new AI laboratories demonstrate the scale’s practical application. Humans&, founded by former Anthropic, xAI, and Google researchers, represents a Level 3 organization. The company raised $480 million in seed funding while describing ambitious workplace tools. However, executives remain deliberately vague about specific monetization strategies and product roadmaps. Thinking Machines Lab presents a more complex case. Initially positioned as a Level 4 contender with a $2 billion seed round, recent executive departures suggest potential recalibration. The laboratory’s commercial trajectory remains uncertain despite strong initial positioning. This volatility highlights how commercial intent can evolve rapidly in response to technical challenges and market dynamics. World Labs: From Academic Research to Commercial Venture Fei-Fei Li’s World Labs demonstrates remarkable commercial evolution. The spatial AI company began as a Level 2 research project in 2024 with $230 million in funding. Within eighteen months, World Labs shipped both a world-generating model and commercial products. The company now operates at Level 4 with clear monetization pathways in gaming and special effects industries. This rapid progression illustrates how academic research can transform into commercial ventures when market opportunities emerge. World Labs identified specific industry needs unmet by major AI laboratories. Consequently, the company developed targeted solutions with immediate revenue potential. This case study demonstrates successful research-to-commercial translation within the AI sector. Safe Superintelligence: The Pure Research Model Ilya Sutskever’s Safe Superintelligence (SSI) represents the definitive Level 1 organization. The laboratory raised $3 billion while explicitly rejecting commercial pressures. SSI maintains no product cycles and focuses exclusively on superintelligent foundation model research. This approach prioritizes scientific advancement over financial returns, creating unique investor dynamics. Interestingly, Sutskever acknowledges potential commercial pivots under specific conditions. Extended research timelines or breakthrough developments might prompt reconsideration of monetization strategies. This flexibility demonstrates how even philosophically pure research organizations maintain optionality regarding future commercialization. Historical Precedents and Industry Evolution The AI industry contains numerous examples of commercial intent evolution. OpenAI’s transition from nonprofit research organization to commercial powerhouse represents the most dramatic shift. The laboratory spent years at Level 1 before accelerating to Level 5 through strategic partnerships and product launches. This transformation created significant market disruption and established new commercial benchmarks. Meta’s early AI research operated at Level 2 while the company pursued Level 4 commercial objectives. This misalignment between research focus and corporate goals created strategic challenges. Eventually, Meta recalibrated its AI research to better align with commercial priorities. These historical cases inform current evaluations of emerging laboratories. Investor Perspectives on Commercial Intent Venture capital firms approach AI laboratory investments with diverse strategies. Some prioritize pure research with long-term horizons, accepting minimal commercial intent. Others seek immediate monetization pathways and detailed business plans. The 5-level scale facilitates clearer communication between entrepreneurs and investors regarding expectations and objectives. Sequoia Capital’s recent investments demonstrate this strategic diversity. The firm participates in both commercially aggressive ventures and research-focused organizations. This balanced approach acknowledges AI’s dual nature as both scientific discipline and commercial opportunity. Other investment firms specialize in specific levels along the commercial intent spectrum. Market Implications and Competitive Dynamics The proliferation of AI laboratories with varying commercial intentions creates complex market dynamics. Level 5 organizations compete directly for enterprise contracts and consumer attention. Level 1 and Level 2 laboratories operate in separate ecosystems focused on research breakthroughs. This stratification allows specialization but creates integration challenges across the AI value chain. Industry consolidation will likely accelerate as commercial pressures increase. Research-focused laboratories may partner with commercially aggressive organizations to translate breakthroughs into products. Alternatively, pure research entities might maintain independence through philanthropic funding or government grants. The 5-level scale helps predict these strategic movements. Regulatory Considerations and Ethical Dimensions Commercial intent significantly influences AI safety and ethical considerations. Research-focused laboratories often prioritize safety protocols over development speed. Commercially aggressive organizations face pressure to accelerate deployment, potentially compromising safety measures. Regulatory frameworks must account for these divergent motivations when establishing governance standards. The European Union’s AI Act recognizes these distinctions through tiered regulatory approaches. Research organizations receive different treatment than commercial deployers. This nuanced regulation acknowledges that commercial intent affects risk profiles and ethical considerations. Similar frameworks are emerging in other jurisdictions as AI governance evolves. Conclusion The 5-level scale for measuring AI labs commercial ambitions provides essential clarity in a rapidly evolving industry. This framework distinguishes between research-focused organizations and commercially aggressive enterprises, enabling better investment decisions and strategic planning. As artificial intelligence continues transforming global economies, understanding commercial intent becomes increasingly crucial. The scale offers valuable insights into laboratory motivations, investment patterns, and market dynamics, ultimately supporting more informed ecosystem development. FAQs Q1: What distinguishes Level 1 from Level 2 AI laboratories? Level 1 laboratories prioritize philosophical research with minimal commercial consideration, while Level 2 organizations have preliminary commercialization concepts without detailed implementation plans. Q2: How does commercial intent affect AI safety protocols? Research-focused laboratories typically emphasize safety over development speed, while commercially aggressive organizations face pressure to accelerate deployment, potentially affecting safety prioritization. Q3: Can AI laboratories transition between levels on the commercial scale? Yes, organizations frequently evolve their commercial positioning. OpenAI transitioned from Level 1 to Level 5, while other laboratories may recalibrate based on research outcomes or market opportunities. Q4: What investment strategies align with different commercial intent levels? Long-term investors often support Level 1 and Level 2 laboratories, while growth-focused funds typically target Level 4 and Level 5 organizations with clear monetization pathways. Q5: How does commercial intent influence regulatory treatment? Regulatory frameworks increasingly distinguish between research-focused and commercially deployed AI systems, with different requirements based on intended use and potential impact.

In a recent update shared on X, the exchange said the rollout now stands at 100% complete. Consequently, Coinbase users can trade a much wider range of Solana assets from inside the main app, which marks a major shift in how the platform approaches token access. Coinbase Expands Solana Token Access Through Jupiter Coinbase confirmed that users in the United States, excluding New York, and in Brazil can now trade Solana tokens through Jupiter. Jupiter operates as Solana’s leading DEX aggregator, and Coinbase has embedded it directly into the trading experience. Hence, users can swap tokens without jumping between apps, wallets, or external sites. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong also shared the update with the wider crypto community. Additionally, he highlighted that Coinbase now supports trading across millions of Base and Solana tokens. This setup removes the usual delay that traders face when they wait for new listings. Coinbase first introduced the plan in December, when it said it would expand DEX trading access to Solana. Moreover, the company signaled that the rollout would follow over the next few weeks. With the work now complete, Coinbase has moved from early access to full delivery. Solana’s Token Boom Drives Demand for Faster Trading Tools Solana continues to attract rapid token creation and heavy decentralized trading activity. Significantly, Solana users reportedly launched 11 million tokens in 2025 alone. During the same year, DEX trading volume on the network reportedly hit $1.5 trillion. That scale helps explain why Coinbase prioritized the integration. Traders want speed, wider coverage, and smoother execution across fast-moving markets. Consequently, Coinbase’s Jupiter connection could appeal to users who prefer fast swaps and early token access. Coinbase Positions Itself as a Neutral Marketplace Coinbase said it aims to set a new standard for how exchanges handle token access. The company stated that it runs an agency-only model and matches buyers and sellers directly. Besides, Coinbase said it never trades against customers or runs a proprietary trading desk. Coinbase also said it does not offer internalizer or market-making services, which supports natural price discovery. Moreover, it said projects do not need to post price-trap security deposits to get listed. Meanwhile, Coinbase continues to add new assets. ImmuneFi is now available on Coinbase and its app. Additionally, Doodles and Moonbirds joined the Coinbase roadmap today.

Paul Cavanagh heard the news a few months before Christmas. Five years ago, the Financial Conduct Authority took the opposite stance. In 2020, the FCA banned retail investors from buying crypto derivatives and exchange-traded notes. Officials said prices swung too much. They pointed to cybercrime. They said many people did not understand the risks. At the time, the watchdog said the ban would save consumers £53 million. “This ban reflects how seriously we view the potential harm to retail consumers in these products,” said Sheldon Mills in 2020. He added, “Significant price volatility, combined with the inherent difficulties of valuing cryptoassets reliably, places retail consumers at a high risk of suffering losses from trading crypto derivatives.” Since then, the market has changed. Adoption grew. Other regions, including the US, moved toward clearer rules. In March last year, the FCA allowed crypto ETNs to list on the London Stock Exchange, but only for institutions. There are now 17 such products on the exchange, offered by firms including 21Shares, Invesco, and Fidelity. In October, the FCA lifted the retail ban. Investors could buy bitcoin and other coins through regulated, exchange-listed products. The next day, officials confirmed these products could also sit inside ISAs and SIPPs. Matthew Long from the FCA said, “Since we restricted retail access to crypto ETNs, the market has evolved, and products have become more mainstream and better understood.” He said consumers would get more choice with protections in place. Demand grows as investors seek simpler access The FCA estimates that about 5 million people hold crypto in the UK, down from 7 million in 2024. For them, Isa access matters. Gains inside an Isa are exempt from income tax and capital gains tax. When readers were asked if they would use the new option, many said yes. Anthony Merlo said he wanted to use it but could not. He had already filled his £20,000 ISA allowance. “I was excited, but pretty soon realised I couldn’t take advantage of it. It was a little frustrating,” he said. To use future allowances, he would need an Innovative Finance Isa, which few providers offer. Matthew Tagliani from Invesco said demand was not only about tax. He said the process had been a barrier. “Previously, if you wanted to buy crypto, you had to do so through a totally different exchange, set up a wallet, and go through a whole different process,” he said. “There is a certain segment of the investor community that just does not think that is worth it.” Paul agreed. He holds assets on US platforms like Coinbase. He said many people do not want another account. “If I have it through my normal Isa provider, I will be more likely to use it,” he said. The products also come with tighter rules, like the fact that they must meet FCA disclosure standards. Providers fall under Consumer Duty obligations. They must warn users clearly. These investments are not covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. ISA structure draws criticism despite wider access At first, UK crypto ETNs could sit inside normal stocks and shares ISAs. From April 6, HM Revenue and Customs said they must move into Innovative Finance ISAs instead. These accounts were built for peer-to-peer lending and remain niche. “The Innovative Finance Isa hasn’t been hugely successful in terms of uptake,” said Laith Khalaf from AJ Bell. He questioned why these products were placed there when the same assets can sit inside SIPPs and regular accounts. Jason Hollands from Evelyn Partners called the setup “strange.” He said a few major platforms would launch a new Isa just for this. He also noted that crypto ETNs remain restricted mass market investments. That status requires strong risk warnings and tight controls on promotions. Some critics questioned the broader goal. One fund manager said Isa tax benefits should support productive UK assets, not volatile ones. The debate is not new. Some argue Isas should boost UK markets. Others say they exist to help people save, not to direct capital. Jason said, “If you’re in that school of thought that the government tax incentives should be aimed at stuff that benefits the UK economy, then you might argue, why would we do this for highly speculative assets that don’t actually invest in making it real or tangible?” Russell Barlow from 21Shares rejected that view. He compared crypto volatility to single stocks. “We don’t prevent them from being owned in Isas,” he said. He likened the risk profile to early stage ventures. Matthew from Invesco said friendlier rules do not push people to speculate. “It does not necessarily incentivise it. It puts it on a level playing field with other assets,” he said. Laith said there could be another effect. Younger investors already holding crypto might add traditional assets once they enter mainstream platforms. For Paul, the past still stings. After the 2021 ruling, he sold his ethereum. It later rose about 90%. “I thought the government was looking after people,” he said.",OP-ED|FCA,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-24 18:04:33

While traders closely monitor technical indicators and price structure, long-term investors remain focused on fundamentals and external forecasts. Against this backdrop, Elon Musk’s Grok AI has offered a forward-looking assessment of where XRP could trade by February 1, 2026 . XRP Price Action Reflects a Cautious Market XRP recently posted an 8.1% weekly gain, signaling a recovery attempt despite uneven sentiment across the digital asset market. Buyers have shown renewed interest, but sellers continue to defend key resistance levels. This price behavior reflects a market that favors measured accumulation rather than aggressive speculation. Broader crypto conditions remain fragile. Liquidity shifts, macroeconomic uncertainty, and rotating capital flows continue to influence price action across major assets, including XRP. As a result, traders have adopted a more selective and data-driven approach. Network Developments and Institutional Interest XRP’s underlying fundamentals continue to strengthen. Ongoing XRP Ledger upgrades focus on improving transaction efficiency, scalability, and support for tokenization and enterprise-grade financial use cases. These improvements reinforce XRP’s positioning as infrastructure for cross-border payments and on-chain settlement. Institutional interest also remains steady . Financial institutions and payment providers continue to explore blockchain-based settlement solutions, keeping XRP relevant within that evolving narrative. However, adoption has progressed incrementally rather than explosively, limiting near-term upside momentum. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Grok AI’s XRP Price Forecast Grok AI, developed by xAI under Elon Musk’s leadership, evaluated XRP’s market conditions and arrived at a conservative but constructive forecast. The AI model projects that XRP could trade between $2.00 and $2.40 by February 1, 2026. Grok’s outlook accounts for XRP’s recent price recovery, continued ledger development, and sustained institutional engagement. At the same time, the model emphasizes restraint. It highlights persistent market volatility and the absence of major immediate catalysts as factors that cap aggressive price expansion. What the Forecast Means for Investors Grok’s projection aligns with a broader shift toward realistic expectations across the crypto market. Rather than anticipating dramatic rallies, many analysts now emphasize gradual appreciation supported by fundamentals and network utility. As February 2026 approaches, XRP’s performance will depend on its ability to maintain technical support, expand real-world usage, and navigate macroeconomic conditions. Grok’s forecast reinforces a narrative of cautious optimism, offering investors a grounded outlook anchored in current market realities rather than speculation.

Regulatory clarity now separates winners from laggards in the evolving crypto ETF landscape. Market participants continue to assess how ETF approvals influence capital flows and credibility. Against this backdrop, Dogecoin has gained an advantage that Shiba Inu has yet to match. Dogecoin Secures First SEC-Approved Meme Coin ETF Dogecoin strengthened its position after a spot ETF tied to the token received approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Earlier this week, the 21Shares Dogecoin ETF began trading on Nasdaq under the ticker TDOG, according to regulatory filings. The approval makes Dogecoin the first and only meme coin with a standalone SEC-approved spot ETF. With the launch, Dogecoin now trades alongside Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and XRP in the U.S. spot ETF market. The development improves institutional access to DOGE and reinforces its role as the leading meme coin. Market data shows Dogecoin commands a market capitalization of about $21 billion, far ahead of its nearest rival. Shiba Inu, which launched in August 2020 as Dogecoin’s primary competitor, has no exclusive spot ETF filing in the United States. Its only ETF-related exposure came through a mention as a potential asset in a T. Rowe Price ETF, rather than a dedicated product. As a result, DOGE now stands alone among meme coins with direct ETF approval. Why Shiba Inu Remains Absent From the ETF Market Shiba Inu’s absence from the spot ETF race has drawn attention, given that it meets several eligibility benchmarks. The SEC classifies meme coins like SHIB as non-securities, a key requirement for spot ETF approval. In addition, SHIB already trades through a regulated futures product on Coinbase, a path previously taken by Bitcoin and Ethereum. Grayscale has also identified SHIB as eligible under the SEC’s Generic Listing Standard, which regulators approved in mid-2025. Despite these factors, no U.S. asset manager has filed for a standalone Shiba Inu spot ETF. Community members continue to push for progress, but issuers have remained cautious. Critics cite structural concerns as a deterrent for institutions. They point to anonymous leadership, slow development cycles, unfinished projects, and reported internal disputes within the ecosystem. While SHIB launched an exchange-traded product in Europe through Valour, U.S. firms have favored alternatives like PENGU and BONK. As Dogecoin’s ETF begins trading, its regulatory milestone has widened the gap with Shiba Inu. The approval underscores how institutional trust and governance now shape competition within the meme coin sector.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|REGULATION|SHIB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-24 18:10:35

Since the beginning of 2025, the MSCI Metals and Mining Index has jumped nearly 90%, crushing semiconductors, banks, and even tech giants. Wall Street fund managers who once ignored these stocks are now going heavy. They’re not doing it for fun. The demand for metals is exploding, and supply can’t keep up. This rally isn’t slowing down. Copper is already up 50% this year. That’s because it’s essential for energy infrastructure, EVs, and AI data centers. But it’s not just copper. Silver, nickel, aluminum, and platinum are all gaining ground too. Even gold is holding strong. Investors are still piling into it as a hedge against what’s happening with U.S. money policy and rising global tensions. Fund managers increase mining exposure despite caution Mining stocks used to be dead weight. Everyone was focused on tech and banks, especially while China’s economy looked shaky. That changed when Beijing started cutting interest rates and pledging economic support. Suddenly, the metals sector didn’t look so bad. Dilin Wu at Pepperstone said, “Mining stocks have quietly gone from a boring defensive sleeve to an essential portfolio anchor, one of the few sectors positioned to catch both changing monetary policy and a shaky geopolitical setup.” What’s interesting is that copper and aluminum don’t follow the economy like they used to. They’ve become long-term bets. That’s why people are buying dips every time prices fall. Europe’s fund managers now have a net 26% overweight in the mining sector. That’s the highest in four years, even if it’s still below the 38% they had back in 2008. M&A heats up as valuations stay cheap Even after the rally, the sector still looks underpriced. The Stoxx 600 Basic Resources Index is trading at a forward price-to-book ratio of 0.47, while the average sits closer to 0.59. In past cycles, it peaked above 0.7. So there’s room left. Alain Gabriel from Morgan Stanley said, “This valuation gap stays wide even though natural resources are more important than ever.” Alain also pointed out that companies are choosing to acquire other firms rather than build new sites. It’s cheaper, quicker, and less risky. Right now, Anglo American is buying Teck Resources. And there’s talk of Rio Tinto teaming up with Glencore. Miners want scale. They want better portfolios. Copper is the target. Everyone knows there’s a supply problem. And if demand keeps pushing higher, so will prices. That means the stocks still have room to run. Big players like BHP and Rio Tinto are still tied to iron ore. But iron’s not doing much. The last China-led supercycle is over. That’s why they’re moving to copper. Meanwhile, only a few companies offer pure copper exposure; Freeport-McMoRan and Antofagasta are two of them. Some are staying cautious. Bank of America actually downgraded the sector in Europe. They said there’s a risk of bad economic surprises. Nick Ferres from Vantage Point said he’s pulled back on gold for now. “I get concerned when the price of any asset goes parabolic,” Nick said. “But the miners are cheap. If gold holds up, we’d scale back in on a pullback.” Bloomberg Intelligence says copper will still be in deficit this year, and the gap may even be worse than in 2025. As for gold, they say prices could hit $5,000. Goldman Sachs thinks it’ll go even higher, $5,400 by the end of 2026, about 8% above where it is now. Gerald Gan from Reed Capital isn’t pulling back. “The upside drivers for commodities are now more powerful and more diversified,” Gerald said. “In the coming months, we’re planning to raise our mining exposure.” Sharpen your strategy with mentorship + daily ideas - 30 days free access to our trading program",News|Copper|NICKEL|Silver,EN,0,0,ASIA|FIAT|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-24 18:14:11

The global digital assets market too looked clueless as Bitcoin failed to hold over the $90k mark. Investors continued to rotate money towards Solana and XRP. The global crypto market cap surged marginally to remain above $3.02 trillion. Its 24 hour trading volume dipped by 19% to hover around $80.5 billion. Data shows that Bitcoin ETFs posted an outflow of around $104 million on Thursday. This marked a fifth straight day of withdrawals. Bitcoin price is now down by around 7% in the last 7 days. Bitcoin, Ether ETFs extend losing streak Ether ETFs saw money leaving, too. They posted a net outflow of $41.74 million. This extended its losing streak to four consecutive sessions. ETH price has dropped by more than 11% in the past 24 hours to hover around $2,950. As per the data provided by SoSoValue, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust accounted for almost all of that figure. IBIT saw $101.62 million leave the fund in a single session. Despite the pullback, IBIT remains the largest Bitcoin ETF by flows. However, its total net inflows stand at around $62.9 billion since launch. Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund stood in the second spot in the tally of outflows on the day. It saw $1.95 million leave the fund. Its total inflows hover around $11.46 billion. All Bitcoin spot ETFs now hold net assets of about $115.88 billion. This represents around 6.48% of Bitcoin’s total market cap. Bitcoin is trading at an average price of $89,122 at the press time. Ether-linked ETFs are struggling to attract new capital, while ETH is also struggling to keep up in the market. The market is dealing with uncertain selling pressure due to political drama brewing in Washington. The US Senate reportedly suspended sessions. This has delayed progress on a long-awaited crypto market structure bill. Solana, XRP ETFs buck market slump While Bitcoin and Ethe ETFs bled, Solana and XRP-linked funds posted gains. Solana ETFs recorded inflows of about $1.87 million on Jan. 23. However, XRP ETFs recorded $3.43 million in inflows in the same session. Solana failed to hold above $127 after a week of consolidation. SOL witnessed steady selling pressure as the entire market posted red indexes. Data shows that Solana ETFs attracted more than $9 million in net inflows in the last week. Solana ETFs now hold net assets of about $1.08 billion. Their net asset ratio stands near 1.50%. SOL is trading at an average price of $126.85 at the press time. XRP has also benefited from the shift. XRP ETFs recorded more than $3.43 million in inflows. Attention is also turning to new ETF structures. Asset manager Cyber Hornet has filed for an S&P Crypto 10 ETF under the ticker CTX. The product could become the first spot crypto basket linked to an S&P index. According to the filing, Bitcoin would make up about 69% of the portfolio. Ether would account for roughly 14%. XRP would represent about 5%. Other holdings would include Binance Coin at 4% and Solana at 2%. Smaller allocations would go to TRON, Cardano, Bitcoin Cash, Chainlink, and Stellar.

Analysts indicate that this trend is repeating itself as one new crypto has been speeding through its final phases as attention is drawn to its lending model and future protocol launch. The utility-oriented investors are of the opinion that this cycle may position a better performance period in early 2026. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is creating a decentralized lending system which will enable users to access liquidity without selling their assets. Two lending markets are supported by the protocol. The first is the P2C market. Users contribute assets to a liquidity pool that is shared and receive APY in the form of mtTokens. In case of escalation in demand to borrow, APY will increase. The liquidity is attracted by the pool through posting of collateral by the borrowers at loan-to-value ratios. The second market is P2P. Borrowers do not utilize the pool but either directly match with lenders at the same collateral and liquidation rules. This enables users to organize borrowing requirements without using common liquidity, and without the disposal of their original holdings. The data regarding participation has been growing by development. Mutuum Finance has collected $19.9M and attracted 18,900 holders. Analysts believe that this involvement is important since lending procedures are dependent on borrowers and lenders to generate fee activity after it is rolled out. The upcoming V1 protocol , using the first layer of usage that adds the borrowing and liquidation layer, along with the account of mtTokens and debt, will roll out on the Sepolia testnet in Q1 2026, according to the official X version of the project. Pricing and Early Appreciation MUTM is in Phase 7 of its structured distribution and it trades at a price of $0.04. The presale began in early 2025 at $0.01. The cost has since gone up by 300%. The overall supply of MUTM is 4B tokens. Out of that supply, 1.82B tokens or 45.5% are designated to early access. It has already sold 830M tokens. Progressive advancement of prices has been a significant factor. Phase 1 entrants were at a rate of $0.01 and are pegged at a 500% increase at the official launch price of $0.06. The following Phase will add approximately 20% to the MUTM pricing. Analysts attribute this development that has promoted earlier entry since delayed entrants are valued more as supply becomes constrained. Security and Technical Checking The collateral management and liquidation regulations make lending protocols to be secured. Mutuum Finance has been audited by Halborn Security . CertiK also provides a 90 out of 100 score on token scan to the project. Furthermore, there is now a running bug bounty program, with a value of $50,000, to discover any vulnerabilities, thus preventing the initiation of borrowing activity. These security layers are said to be regarded as crucial to DeFi lending as they lessen the danger of liquidity providers and borrowers. Investor Demand Signals Phase 7 has been running at a higher pace than before. The positive news in the market indicated a recent whale allocation of 115K, which was seen as a sign of increasing conviction before V1. According to analysts, in most cases, the whale entries take place after the development and security information is on display as opposed to before. Onboarding tools have also enabled participation. Mutuum Finance has a 24-hour leaderboard which is issued daily and pays out the most contributors with $500 in MUTM. There is also the addition of access to card payment that eliminates a common obstacle to users who are not holders of crypto assets. Such characteristics have made it less frictious and more consistent in participation in later stages. According to the analysts of top crypto prospects in 2026, a very small number of new crypto initiatives have integrated structured token distribution, utility creation and security validation prior to mainnet preparation, making Mutuum Finance one of such opportunities. As of today, with MUTM at $0.04 and Phase 7 just about to be finished, it is in one of the last windows of Mutuum Finance before its V1 testnet launch. The integration of two lending markets, mtToken yield monitoring, security auditing, oracle pricing and user onboarding applications have made the project a DeFi contender on the next round. To investors considering their 2026 investments in crypto, analysts see Mutuum Finance as one that fits the description of utility-based token that is on the verge of the initial usage stage on Ethereum.

The wallet associated with the company sent a large deposit to the institutional arm of Coinbase, a platform used by big traders and companies. Analysts watching on-chain flows immediately flagged the move as a likely setup for a sale, though no confirmed sell orders have been announced. Big Move To Coinbase Prime According to on-chain reports , GameStop holds 4,710 BTC that it bought last year, and that full balance was shifted into Coinbase Prime. The company first bought the coins in May 2025 at prices that averaged near $107,900 per BTC, a buy that cost roughly $504 million at the time. Moving a corporate treasury from cold storage to an active institutional account is often read as a step toward execution — to sell, hedge, or rebalance — but it is not the same as a sale itself. GameStop throws in the towel? Their on-chain wallets just moved all BTC holdings to Coinbase Prime, likely to sell. Between May 14–23, 2025, they bought 4,710 BTC at an avg. price of $107.9K, investing ~$504M. Now selling for around $90.8K, potentially realising approximately… pic.twitter.com/Bp7MwRVQ43 — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) January 23, 2026 What Analysts Are Saying Reports say the math is simple and stark: selling now, with Bitcoin trading closer to the $90,000 area, would lock in a sizable loss versus the initial purchase price. Several analytics firms put that figure near $76 million if the whole lot were sold at recent market levels. Some market watchers suggest the company could be doing tax-loss harvesting or trimming volatile assets on its books. Others view it as a pragmatic adjustment to reduce treasury exposure to crypto swings. Still, defenders of the move point out that GameStop’s Bitcoin stake was never a core retail play; it was a treasury experiment meant to diversify. How Much Has Already Moved Not all outlets agree on timing or size of day-by-day transfers. Reports note that some transfers earlier this month added up to about half of the original position — roughly 2,396 BTC moved in smaller tranches before the full deposit was flagged. On-chain sleuths track each shift, and those staggered movements can mean many things: a staged sale, an internal reorganization, or simply routing through a trusted custodian before any trades. Market And Shareholder Reaction Share action around GameStop has not mirrored the crypto chatter. While Bitcoin watchers focused on the wallet move, investors were also reacting to company news on other fronts, including fresh share purchases by CEO Ryan Cohen.

This innovative platform, founded in 2025 by Lax Poojary, Lucie Marchand, and Myn Kang, addresses a critical gap in current educational technology by moving beyond text-based AI interactions to create fully immersive learning expeditions. The startup recently secured $5 million in pre-seed funding led by Swiss venture firm Founderful, marking their first pure-play edtech investment and signaling strong confidence in this emerging educational approach. AI Learning App Addresses Critical Educational Gaps Traditional education systems frequently struggle to keep pace with rapidly evolving technological concepts and essential modern skills. Consequently, Sparkli’s founders identified a substantial opportunity to enhance how children learn about contemporary topics. The platform specifically focuses on teaching financial literacy, entrepreneurship, and design thinking through AI-generated content. Moreover, the application creates personalized learning paths based on children’s questions and interests, transforming passive learning into active exploration. Parents Poojary and Kang initially developed the concept after experiencing frustration with existing educational tools. “Children possess natural curiosity, but standard AI assistants typically provide walls of text that fail to engage young learners,” Poojary explained during an exclusive interview. “We recognized that children crave interactive experiences rather than passive information consumption.” This fundamental insight drove the development of Sparkli’s unique approach to educational content delivery. Generative AI Education Platform Technical Architecture Sparkli utilizes advanced generative AI to create all media assets dynamically in response to user queries. The system can generate complete learning experiences within two minutes of receiving a question, with ongoing efforts to reduce this response time further. Each learning expedition incorporates multiple content formats including: Interactive audio narratives with character voices and sound effects Custom-generated video content illustrating complex concepts visually Dynamic image creation tailored to specific learning objectives Gamified quizzes with adaptive difficulty levels Choose-your-own-adventure style learning paths The platform’s technical team, led by CTO Lucie Marchand, previously collaborated at Google’s Area 120 incubator on Shoploop, a video-focused social commerce application. This experience with consumer-facing technology directly informed Sparkli’s development priorities and user experience design principles. Educational Science Foundation and Safety Protocols Unlike many AI tools developed primarily by engineers, Sparkli incorporated educational expertise from its earliest stages. The company’s first two hires included a PhD holder specializing in educational science and artificial intelligence, plus an experienced classroom teacher. This deliberate staffing decision ensures content aligns with established pedagogical principles while leveraging cutting-edge technology. Safety represents a paramount concern in children’s AI applications, particularly following recent lawsuits against companies like OpenAI and Character.ai regarding harmful content exposure. Sparkli implements multiple protective measures: Safety Feature Implementation Content Filtering Complete prohibition of sexual content and age-inappropriate material Sensitive Topic Handling Redirects questions about self-harm to emotional intelligence education and parent communication encouragement Progress Monitoring Teacher and parent dashboards for activity tracking Data Privacy Compliance with COPPA and international children’s data protection standards Edtech Startup Pilot Programs and Market Strategy Sparkli conducted extensive testing during 2025, piloting their application in over twenty schools with extremely positive feedback from educators and students. Currently, the company partners with an educational institute network encompassing more than 100,000 students. Teachers particularly appreciate how the platform facilitates discussion-based learning formats and enables customized homework assignments that measure student understanding effectively. The startup’s engagement mechanics draw inspiration from successful platforms like Duolingo, incorporating streaks, rewards, and quest cards to encourage regular usage. Children receive personalized learning adventures based on their selected avatars, creating emotional investment in the educational process. Furthermore, the application highlights one new topic daily, promoting consistent learning habits and knowledge expansion. Sparkli’s immediate strategy focuses on institutional partnerships with schools globally, with plans to launch consumer access for parents by mid-2026. This phased approach allows refinement based on educational professional feedback before broader public release. The company’s teacher module enables educators to track student progress, assign specific expeditions, and monitor completion rates through intuitive dashboards. Investment Landscape and Market Differentiation Founderful’s decision to lead Sparkli’s $5 million pre-seed round reflects growing investor interest in educational technology that addresses genuine learning gaps. Founding partner Lukas Weder, himself a parent of school-aged children, noted: “Current educational systems often overlook crucial skills like financial literacy and technological innovation understanding. Sparkli’s immersive approach provides meaningful alternatives to video game consumption while delivering substantive educational value.” The platform distinguishes itself from competitors through several key features: Multi-modal content generation beyond text and voice interfaces Pedagogically-informed design developed with educational experts School integration capabilities with comprehensive teacher tools Safety-first architecture with proactive content moderation Personalized learning paths adapting to individual curiosity patterns Conclusion Sparkli represents a significant advancement in AI-powered educational technology, addressing longstanding limitations in how children engage with learning content. By combining generative AI capabilities with educational science principles and robust safety protocols, this AI learning app creates genuinely interactive experiences that captivate young minds. The platform’s successful pilot programs, substantial funding, and experienced founding team position it for meaningful impact on global education. As Sparkli expands its institutional partnerships and prepares for consumer launch, it establishes new standards for how technology can enhance rather than replace traditional learning methodologies while preparing children for an increasingly complex technological future. FAQs Q1: What age group does Sparkli target? Sparkli primarily serves children aged 5-12, with content calibrated to different developmental stages within this range. Q2: How does Sparkli ensure child safety with AI-generated content? The platform implements multiple safety layers including prohibited content filters, sensitive topic redirection to appropriate resources, and comprehensive activity monitoring for parents and teachers. Q3: What educational background do Sparkli’s creators possess? The founding team includes former Google employees with extensive technology experience, complemented by educational science PhDs and classroom teachers hired specifically to ensure pedagogical soundness. Q4: When will Sparkli be available for home use? The company plans to launch consumer access for parents by mid-2026, following extensive school-based pilot programs and refinement based on educator feedback. Q5: How does Sparkli differ from using ChatGPT or similar AI tools for education? Unlike general-purpose AI assistants that provide text-based responses, Sparkli creates multi-modal interactive learning expeditions with audio, video, images, quizzes, and games specifically designed for child engagement and educational effectiveness.

The analyst is confident the altcoin could reach these targets, noting that current price action is mirroring the previous bull run. XRP Eyes Rally To $11 And Then $70 In an X post, Crypto Bull stated that the next impulse will take XRP to $11 and that the last wave will take the altcoin to $70. This came as he noted that the price pattern is mirroring the previous bull run, with the only difference being time, which he claimed makes sense, as the altcoin needs longer accumulation to reach higher prices. Related Reading: XRP Completes ‘Super Guppy Compression’ Against Bitcoin, Next Target Emerges The analyst also indicated that it could take a year of accumulation for XRP to reach the $11 price target, meaning the last wave to $70 could take much longer. This prediction comes despite the current decline in the crypto market, with XRP trading below the psychological $2 price level. Despite the current bearish sentiment, crypto analyst CW has also declared that the XRP rally is about to begin and that the road to $21.5 is just the beginning. He noted that this is the Phase 4 peak while the first goal is for the altcoin to break its current all-time high (ATH). His accompanying chart showed that XRP could reach this $21 target by year-end. Meanwhile, there is the possibility of the altcoin rallying above $100 in the next Phase 1, which could happen next year. Crypto Pundit X Finance Bull recently highlighted the CLARITY Act and Trump’s tariffs as factors that could boost XRP’s demand and lead to higher prices for the altcoin. He expects the CLARITY Act to boost XRP’s demand, especially with Trump’s Crypto Czar predicting that more banks will enter into crypto once the bill passes. X Finance Bull predicts that XRP will be the token of choice for these banks based on his belief that Ripple will provide the rails to onboard them. XRP Breaking Out Of Multi-Year Triangle Crypto analyst XForce revealed in an X post that XRP is breaking out of the largest 6+ year triangle in history, yet people are calling it a fakeout. He added that he is not a permabull or permanbear on the altcoin but that he follows trends and plays macro breakout patterns. His accompanying chart indicated that XRP was on the verge of a move to the upside, with a potential rally above $11.50. Related Reading: XRP Price Recovery Is Possible If It Reclaims This Ichimoku Base On the lower timeframe, crypto analyst Chart Nerd stated that XRP is currently breaking out of a two-week falling wedge structure. He noted that this is a bullish reversal pattern that could send the altcoin back to $2.40 in the short term, as this is where the wedge formed. He highlighted a key resistance between $2.13 and $2.20, which the altcoin will need to break above to confirm a reversal. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $1.92, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Everyone Needs to See This Setup,https://timestabloid.com/egrag-crypto-42-xrp-price-isnt-hopium-everyone-needs-to-see-this-setup/,"In the unpredictable world of cryptocurrency markets, few narratives capture both intrigue and skepticism like bold long‑term price targets. A $42 valuation for XRP — more than twenty times its current trading levels — sounds like wishful thinking at first glance. Yet a growing cadre of technical analysts insists this figure reflects structural patterns embedded in XRP’s price history, not mere optimism. Recent commentary from market observer Egrag Crypto has sharpened this conversation by pointing to repeating macro structures that suggest the potential for unusually large cyclical moves. The Macro Structure Framework Egrag Crypto’s analysis centers on the idea that XRP’s price history doesn’t unfold randomly. Instead, it reverberates through distinct macro formations, each marked by compression phases that eventually expand into significant price moves. In prior cycles, these structures produced precisely measured moves that aligned with their projected targets, suggesting a methodical rhythm rather than episodic volatility. According to Egrag, the pattern unfolding now — identified as the fourth macro formation — shows the same compression, breakout logic, duration symmetry, and expansion traits that defined earlier cycles. #XRP – $42 Target Isn’t Hopium. It’s Structure: Everyone in the #XRPFamily needs to see this setup. Why 42? Because in some philosophy and culture, 42 represents the answer to life, truth, and meaning. In markets? It becomes a symbol of convergence between math, structure,… pic.twitter.com/wbTWHCSrGU — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) January 24, 2026 This approach treats price history as fractal and structural, meaning that long‑term patterns often repeat in proportionate ways. Rather than offering predictions grounded in sentiment or momentum indicators alone, Egrag emphasized structural symmetry that aligns with historical cycle completion. He clarified that while this reasoning doesn’t guarantee a $42 outcome, it justifies considering such a pathway based on observable patterns rather than “hopium.” Current Market Context and Technical Behavior Technically, XRP has spent much of late 2025 and early 2026 in a period of sideways to lower range trading around multi‑month support, reacting to broader macro headwinds and rotation toward larger market caps like Bitcoin. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Price has hovered near support levels around $1.88–$1.90, with short‑term resistance appearing near $1.96–$2.03. These levels define a zone of equilibrium where buyers and sellers contest direction, and holding above this base remains key for constructive outlooks. Broader technical perspectives still propose medium‑term targets in the single and low double digits. Analysts highlight descending channel patterns and potential breakout structures that could lift prices toward levels like $4–$6 if momentum reasserts. These intermediate outcomes remain statistically more probable in the short‑term than ultra‑high projections, yet they do not invalidate structuring arguments that consider multi‑year dynamics. Interpreting the $42 Narrative While mainstream market forecasts — including institutional models such as Standard Chartered’s projection of $8 by 2026 — tend to stay grounded in broader adoption and regulatory clarity, Egrag’s structural thesis operates on a longer timeline. His framework doesn’t dismiss near‑term patterns; it places them within a bigger picture where historical compressions eventually yield large expansions if structural symmetry persists. Crucially, this perspective reframes price objectives as potential outcomes within a probabilistic structural model, not promises. Investors and traders should view the $42 narrative as one extreme scenario within a spectrum that includes more conservative technical targets and realistic cyclical behavior. That disciplined context enhances clarity and helps distinguish informed structural analysis from pure speculation in volatile crypto markets.

It advised account holders to move their assets to external wallets or personal accounts before the deadline. With the announcement, Nifty Gateway becomes the latest upstart from the NFT era to become defunct after the digital art momentum crashed and burned, as initial excitement and FOMO fizzled out after compounding user losses. Nifty Gateway shuts down Nifty Gateway has announced that it is shutting down. The platform said in a post on X that it will fully close its doors on February 23, 2026. Nifty Gateway was launched in 2020 with a goal to change how people collect and experience digital art. Over the years, it hosted many famous art “drops” and worked with world-renowned creators. Starting today, trading features on the platform are turned off. It is strictly in “withdrawal-only mode.” Users can no longer list NFTs for sale or place bids on new art. Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange owned by the Winklevoss twins, purchased Nifty Gateway in 2019. Gemini leaders stated that they are proud of the team’s work but want to focus on new projects. Specifically, they want to build a “one-stop super app” for all crypto needs. Nifty Gateway account holders need to act before the February deadline. The company is sending emails to everyone who has a balance of U.S. Dollars (USD), Ethereum (ETH), or an NFT in their account. These emails contain step-by-step instructions on how users can move their property. NFTs can be moved to an external wallet or to the Gemini ecosystem. Users will have to pay gas fees to move their items, and Nifty Gateway has confirmed they will not cover these costs. Users who bought items with a credit card for the first time might have to wait 72 hours before they can withdraw them. How’s Gemini moving forward without Nifty Gateway? Before Gemini ultimately cut Nifty Gateway, it launched Gemini Wallet in August 2025 as a tool designed to hold NFTs alongside other cryptocurrencies. Gemini plans to move its NFT community into this new system in order to make crypto easier to use in one single app. Despite the Nifty Gateway’s closing, recent data shows that the NFT market grew by about $700 million in the first few weeks of January. Weekly sales have jumped to around $85 million, a big increase compared to the end of 2025. Notably, users are moving away from simple “profile picture” NFTs and toward “utility” NFTs that give you special access to games, events, or real-world products. Even OG NFt projects such as Pudgy Penguins launched its fungible token PENGU to bridge the gap between “hardcore” NFT collectors and the average crypto retailer. Even OpenSea, a leading venue at the peak of NFT trading, announced in October 2025 that it will pivot to become a crypto asset aggregator. That strategic detour came after previous attempts to revive activity. Devin Finzer announced that OpenSea’s native token, with ticker SEA, will launch during the first quarter of 2026. The founder added that 50% of the token supply will be given to OG users while sharing minimal tokenomics details. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

By 2029, TIA could attain a maximum price of $4.48. In 2032, the TIA price forecast expects a maximum price of $7.53. Celestia generated significant interest before its October 2023 launch. This was largely due to the strong backing from major crypto exchanges from the outset and the intriguing technical concepts behind the Celestia modular blockchain network. In this article, we’ll provide a Celestia price prediction, analyze the factors driving these projections, and explore what the Celestia modular blockchain network brings to the broader crypto landscape.

Celestia and modular rollups enhance Ethereum ‘s performance and expansion, impacting the competition among L1 public chains. Public chains like BNB Chain and Celo opt to integrate with Ethereum as L2 Rollups due to liquidity and cost advantages. Celestia’s scalability and user-friendly design make it an appealing choice for developers, offering additional scalability to the blockchain ecosystem. Why is the TIA price down today? TIA’s price is attempting to hold around $0.455 as sellers gain confidence, resulting in a downward push. Will the TIA price reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment and buying demand, we might see TIA’s price touching the $100 milestone in the coming years. According to our prediction, the TIA price might hit the $100 mark in 2030. Will the TIA price reach $1,000? If the altcoin market remains robust in the coming years and Celestia develops more user-friendly utilities, its price might surpass $1K. Is TIA a good long-term investment? Yes, TIA is a good long-term investment option. As buyers’ interest grows and the network expands, we might see profitable returns. It is advised to do your own research and conduct investment advice before investing in the volatile crypto market.

As expectations for Shiba Inu’s next rally are kept to moderate levels, more and more investors are moving away from meme coins and into utility-based projects. The spotlight has been cast upon a new crypto called Mutuum Finance (MUTM) in Phase 7 of its presale. The presale has already seen a monumental raise of over $19.88 million in funds from over 18,880 supporters. For those looking for the next big crypto, the choice is obvious. Shiba Inu Faces Consolidation Amid Bearish Pressure The latest attempt by the Shiba Inu (SHIB) to rise above the critical resistance level of $0.00000815 has been met with a degree of resistance. As a result, the cryptocurrency has been forced to fall back below this critical resistance level while trading at the lower support level of $0.00000783. Despite the large number of enthusiasts within the crypto ecosystem who support the SHIB cryptocurrency, the latest price action has been a demonstration of the difficulties often faced by meme-based assets. Capitalizing on Presale Momentum Currently, the presale is underway for Mutuum Finance’s Phase 7, with the token available for $0.04, a 300% increase from the initial $0.01. The presale provides the best entry point for the token, considering the projected listing price is $0.06. This provides the investor with the chance to reap immediate profits on their investment. For example, if one invests $3,000 now, the investment is expected to increase by $1,500 when the token lists on exchanges. After the listing, the token is projected to have the chance to increase by 100x, solidifying its position as the best crypto to invest in. Built on a Foundation of Verified Security Trust and security are integral components of the Mutuum Finance protocol, backed by comprehensive third-party security audit results. The platform is fully vetted by Halborn Security on its smart contracts and has been awarded a high Token Scan Score of 90/100, courtesy of CertiK. In a bid to increase security before the eventual launch, the team behind the protocol is operating an active $50,000 bug bounty, with a reward pool that can go as high as $2,000 for critical vulnerabilities. Ecosystem Rewards Besides the presale gains, Mutuum Finance also helps the user earn a regular stream of passive income through the innovative staking rewards feature. A percentage of the revenue generated by the Mutuum Finance platform is used to purchase MUTM tokens, which are distributed in proportionate amounts to the users staking their mtTokens in the safety module. For instance, a user staking $10,000 USDC or 10,000 mtUSDC could earn as much as $1,000 in rewards. In order to stimulate the adoption of the project from the start, as well as to foster the growth of the community, Mutuum Finance has introduced several programs to engage the community. These programs include the big $100,000 giveaway , where ten people will win $10,000 each, as well as the daily top buyer reward of $500 in MUTM tokens. While investors have moved from speculative assets such as Shiba Inu, Mutuum Finance is gaining immense recognition in the market today. This DeFi crypto is currently priced at just $0.04 and has raised over $19.88 million from over 18,880 investors during its presale. This crypto asset stands out due to its fully developed revenue-producing ecosystem created from scratch with verified security, high returns for stakeholders, and high incentives for the wider community.

Casinos without licenses are prone to mismanagement and money laundering. They also operate in a regulatory grey area, raising concerns of legal prosecution and potential criminal penalties. There are multiple recognised international regulatory authorities for crypto casinos. Curacao offers easy, low‑cost licensing with limited oversight, making it popular but less credible. MGA enforces strict EU standards with strong consumer protections and AML/KYC compliance, but at a higher cost. At the same time, the Isle of Man provides robust regulation and fairness similar to Malta. Here are the top regulated crypto casinos in 2026. For each casino, we verified its licenses and reliability. CryptoGames – Best overall licensed crypto casino CryptoGames homepage CryptoGames homepage displays payouts in real time, including losses. On the page, you will also find published games and quick links for self-exclusion and dispute resolution. These are standard requirements for being licensed by the Curaçao Gaming Control Board.

The games are all verifiably fair through a third-party application, and their Random Number Generators (RNGs) are certified by iTech Labs. There are 15 supported cryptocurrencies like USDT, BTC, SHIB, and PEPE. The in-built token ‘PlayMoney’ lets you try out for free. CryptoGames has a low house edge of 0-2.7%. With a low house edge, the house has a small built-in advantage over players, so you win more often over time. Another win you get from CryptoGames is its contests. The contests run every month with each contest targeting a particular aspect of the casino. Players compete for a prize pool exceeding $500,000. Unlike other conventional casinos, the VIP program is not based on player activity; rather, the monthly contest rankings. Top-ranking players are the VIPs, granting them access to exclusive rewards and events. Playing Dice and Roulette wins you a ticket for the casino’s ever-growing jackpot, which at press time was at 50,000 USDT. Pros Responsible gambling tools Predictable payout behavior Prioritizes speed and accountability Modern, crypto-native infrastructure Cons Curacao is lighter than MGA Does not offer sports betting Stake – Best licensed crypto casino for high liquidity Stake sports and promotions Stake is one of the most famous crypto casinos in the world, with a strong compliance posture for a Curacao operator.

Yolo group is also in the process of securing B2B vendor licences in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

According to an analysis by TradingShot , XRP has remained in a sustained bear cycle since topping out in mid-July 2025. In a TradingView post published on January 23, the analysis based on the daily chart shows price action locked inside a clearly defined descending channel, signaling persistent lower highs and lower lows. This structure has dominated XRP’s trend for months and continues to guide downside expectations. XRP price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Over the past several weeks, XRP has struggled to regain key moving averages . The analysis highlighted repeated failures to reclaim the 200-day moving average (MA), a level that typically acts as a major trend filter. Each rejection near this area has reinforced bearish momentum and signaled continuation rather than reversal. More recently, price action formed a lower high in early January 2026, marking the start of a new bearish leg within the broader downtrend. XRP key price level to watch The analysis also notes that XRP has been leaning heavily on longer-term support around the 100-week MA. This level has acted as a cushion during prior declines, but historical patterns on the chart show that when this support gives way, XRP tends to experience accelerated losses. Previous bearish legs within the same channel have produced declines of just over 40%, a move that would align with a drop toward the $1.40–$1.45 zone. Based on the channel projection and past symmetry, the outlook suggests that if XRP fails to reclaim major daily moving averages and the weekly support breaks, the decline could extend into late February 2026. That timeframe aligns with the lower boundary of the descending channel, where the projected target sits near $1.40. XRP price analysis By press time, XRP was trading at $1.91, having corrected by over 2% in the past 24 hours. On the weekly timeframe, the asset is also in the red, down more than 7%. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold At the current price, XRP is trading below its key moving averages, keeping the broader technical outlook bearish. The 50-day simple moving average near $2 is acting as immediate resistance, while the much higher 200-day SMA around $2.50 underscores a firmly negative longer-term trend. Meanwhile, momentum indicators are more balanced. The 14-day RSI stands at around 44, placing XRP in neutral territory. This suggests bearish momentum is present but not overstretched, leaving room for either a modest bounce or further downside.

The tactic is common among hackers trying to launder considerable stolen funds and make recovery almost impossible. The exploit that targeted SagaEVM, described as an L1 to launch L1s, occurred on January 21. After the incident, the team posted on X that the L1 had been paused at block height 6593800 in response to the confirmed exploit on the SagaEVM chainlet. How the hackers laundered the stolen funds According to the report by blockchain security firm CertiK, the attackers initially distributed the funds across five separate wallets before they funneled them into the privacy mixer via multiple transactions. “Mitigation is underway, and the team is fully focused on a solution,” the team wrote at the time. The exploit saw nearly $7,000,000 in USDC, yUSD, ETH, and tBTC transferred to the Ethereum mainnet. The exploiter’s wallet had been identified and fed to exchanges and bridges to blacklist it and possibly reclaim the stolen funds. According to Certik’s report, $6.2 million out of those funds is what has now been split into deposits fed into the Tornado Cash mixer. This is expected to frustrate remediation and recovery efforts. The latest deposit adds to the notoriety of Tornado Cash, adding to a past checkered with US sanctions and legal issues still plaguing its developers. Attackers continue to use it to obscure their trails post-exploit, and it does exactly what it was designed to do — help them disappear. What happened to SagaEVM? According to a post-mortem the team shared on January 21, the incident involved a coordinated sequence of contract deployments, cross-chain activity, and subsequent liquidity withdrawals. The document revealed that the team paused the chain out of an abundance of caution while they actively investigated and mitigated. It revealed the focus was stopping further impact by keeping SagaEVM paused while mitigation is implemented; validating the full blast radius using archive data and execution traces; and hardening the relevant components before a restart. The main components affected by the exploit include the SagaEVM chainlet, as well as Colt and Mustang. Others, like the Saga SSC mainnet, Saga protocol consensus, validator security, and other Saga chainlets, went unaffected. “There has been no consensus failure, validator compromise, or signer key leakage,” the document read . “The broader Saga network remains structurally sound.” The team claimed its next steps would be to complete root cause validation, patch and harden affected cross-chain and deployment components, coordinate with ecosystem partners where relevant, and publish a more comprehensive technical post-mortem. Vulnerability links back to Cosmos After receiving support from Cosmos Labs engineers, the team has revealed that the issue originated from the original Ethermint codebase, making it an inherited issue. In response to that post, Cosmos Labs shared a statement, admitting they are aware of the incident and claiming they have been working closely with Saga and external security partners to investigate and remediate the “confirmed vulnerability.” They revealed they had contacted a subset of EVM chains they deemed affected by the incident and provided short-term mitigations. “As always, we recommend all projects continue to implement baseline security practices such as rate-limiting and security monitoring to strengthen early detection and mitigation,” they wrote on X.

57440842,658912,1769284806,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57440842.jpeg,XRP Dev Shares How To Retire In A Few Years,https://bitcoinist.com/how-to-retire-with-xrp/,"A recent statement from an XRP Ledger (XRPL) developer suggests that XRP could be the key to an early retirement shortcut. Unlike steady paychecks or slow-growing investments in traditional assets, cryptocurrencies have the ability to create generational wealth rapidly, due to their penchant for sudden and explosive price moves. Among the thousands of digital assets on the market, the developer highlighted the token as his primary choice for investors seeking substantial returns, even sharing strategies for how the coin can help them retire in a few years. XRP Emerges As Shortcut To Early Retirement A DropCoin XRPL developer, identified as ‘Bird’ on X, announced on Thursday, January 22, that buying and holding XRP at current prices could help investors retire within a few years. The bold claim quickly caught the attention of many in the crypto community, with some asking the developers to elaborate on the strategies involved and the expected timeline for achieving such wealth. Related Reading: XRP Price Obliteration Is Not A Matter Of If, New All-Time Highs Are Coming Not stopping there, Bird claimed that investing in the token could eliminate the need for a job, suggesting that long-term investors may eventually rely on the potential profits from their holdings as a primary source of income. His statements were in response to a post by Watcher.Guru, which the developer directly referenced to support his optimistic long-term outlook. In that post, Watcher Guru quoted a statement reportedly made by Binance’s founder ChangPeng Zhao , who also agreed that holding crypto assets over time could make jobs unnecessary and allow investors to retire sooner than planned. The Ledger developer shared a screenshot of Zhao making similar remarks about Artificial Intelligence, suggesting that the Binance founder views both crypto and AI as powerful tools for achieving long-term financial freedom . A crypto community member who responded to Bird’s post questioned how long an investor has to hold XRP before retiring early. The developer answered humorously that it could be held indefinitely, adding that some investors could reach early retirement this year, while others may need a few more years. He emphasized that the timeline ultimately depends on how many tokens an investor holds. How High The Altcoin Could Rise To Enable Early Retirement Addressing questions from the crypto community members, Bird shared his outlook on how high he believes XRP’s price could rise, helping investors achieve early retirement. He predicted that within the next few years, the cryptocurrency could rise to $100 and beyon d—a significant jump from its current market price of around $1.90.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/xrpl-validator-says-rip-to-anyone-betting-against-xrp-heres-why/,"In the sweeping drama of cryptocurrency markets, narratives of doubt and dismissal frequently surface around major assets. Yet, some developments don’t just stir conversation — they reshape how investors and institutions perceive long‑term viability. For XRP, which has historically weathered skepticism from markets and critics alike, recent ecosystem progress and structural enhancements tell a story that extends well beyond short‑term price action. When XRPL validator Vet recently proclaimed a symbolic “RIP to anyone betting against XRP and its community,” he spoke from a position deeply embedded within the network’s evolution. As an active participant in the XRPL’s decentralized governance through the unique node list (dUNL), Vet’s comments resonate with stakeholders who track not only price but the broader technological traction and adoption sweeping across the ledger’s landscape. RIP to anyone betting against XRP and its community we are cooking — Vet (@Vet_X0) January 22, 2026 XRPL’s Technical and Institutional Momentum The XRP Ledger has progressed far beyond its early role as a fast settlement rail. Developers and ecosystem contributors have introduced core innovations that broaden XRPL’s utility and appeal. Notably, the deployment of a native zero‑knowledge proof (ZKP) identity layer via DNA Protocol marks a significant leap toward privacy‑preserving infrastructure on the chain. This implementation allows cryptographic proofs of identity without exposing sensitive data and operates natively on‑chain — a critical capability for institutional use where compliance and data protection intersect. Complementing privacy advances, the core protocol roadmap has introduced an XRPL EVM sidechain, enabling Ethereum‑compatible smart contracts and attracting developers familiar with Solidity. This development reduces barriers to entry for decentralized finance (DeFi) builders and enhances liquidity movement through cross‑chain channels. Additionally, native liquidity solutions like XLS‑30 AMMs support on‑ledger automated market making, providing liquidity avenues that align with XRPL’s low‑fee, high‑speed ethos and reduce reliance on third‑party decentralized exchanges. These layered improvements reflect a ledger rapidly maturing from a simple payment rail to a multi‑faceted financial infrastructure. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Institutional Adoption & Ecosystem Depth Beyond technology, XRPL’s adoption metrics reveal deeper engagement. Spot XRP exchange‑traded funds (ETFs) have amassed substantial assets under management, approaching nearly a billion dollars, underscoring institutional confidence in XRP’s utility and market structure. Network activity also shows robust daily transactions and expanding active address growth, further indicating that XRP functions as an active utility token — not merely a speculative asset. The rise of stablecoin activity on XRPL, especially with RLUSD integration in institutional real‑world asset (RWA) platforms, signals that demand for diverse financial operations on the ledger is climbing. Scarcity and Market Dynamics On‑chain data hints at declining liquid XRP supply, with exchange balances falling to multi‑year lows as institutional holdings and ETF flows absorb available float. This structural scarcity narrative further strengthens the argument against overly pessimistic market positioning. A New Narrative for XRP Taken together, XRPL’s technical advances, growing institutional embrace, and evolving functional landscape create a compelling backdrop for why dropping short‑term bearish bets against XRP may not reflect the broader reality. Vet’s emphatic message encapsulates more than community fervor; it signals confidence grounded in measurable progress and the ledger’s expanding role within regulated and decentralized finance alike. As XRP continues to attract deeper infrastructure adoption, dismissing its long‑term potential becomes increasingly untenable.

The firm framed crypto less as a speculative asset class and more as infrastructure that could counter growing centralization in AI by giving users control over data, identity, and economic participation. a16z Lays Out Use Cases as AI Power Concentrates In a January 20 post on X, a16z crypto argued that the web is moving toward interfaces dominated by AI prompts, raising questions about who controls data, distribution, and revenue as traditional websites lose traffic. The firm said blockchains can provide a neutral base layer for AI systems by supporting persistent user context, portable identities for AI agents, and on-chain payments that work without platform gatekeepers. Several of the ideas focused on identity and trust, with one example being decentralized proof of personhood, which aims to help platforms distinguish humans from bots without relying on centralized ID providers. The post pointed to existing projects such as World’s Proof of Human and newer systems like the Solana Attestation Service, which lets users link off-chain credentials to wallets while keeping data private. Payments were another recurring theme. a16z described how blockchains could support micropayments between AI agents, content creators, and end users. That includes revenue sharing when AI tools rely on third-party content, as well as systems where web crawlers pay sites directly for access to data. The firm noted that nearly half of internet traffic now comes from automated sources, while more website operators are blocking AI scrapers, a tension that has pushed companies like Cloudflare to sell blocking tools. The post also highlighted decentralized physical infrastructure networks, or DePIN , as a way to pool unused compute and energy resources for AI training and inference. By aggregating hardware from gaming PCs and data centers, these networks aim to reduce reliance on large cloud providers. Why Identity, Payments, and Ownership Keep Resurfacing Many of the ideas echoed concerns raised elsewhere in the crypto industry. For example, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently said that he plans to leave centralized social media behind in favor of decentralized platforms, arguing that shared data layers allow competition without locking users into a single interface. His comments reflected a broader push to separate identity and content from platform control. The Ethereum Foundation has also moved in this direction. Last year, it launched a new AI team focused on agentic payments and coordination, with the stated goal of making Ethereum a settlement layer for AI agents and machine-to-machine transactions. Foundation developer Davide Crapis said at the time that AI systems need neutral infrastructure for value transfer and reputation, rather than relying on a few large technology firms. a16z’s map does not claim these systems are close to mass adoption. Several use cases, including AI companions owned by users or fully open agent-to-agent markets, are described as longer-term ideas. Still, the firm’s outline shows where investors and builders think crypto could fit as AI systems move from isolated tools into always-on intermediaries between people, data, and money.

Business leaders from banking to technology to healthcare couldn’t stop talking about AI during the weeklong event in the Swiss Alps. While many discussed the exciting possibilities of robots and smart machines, most conversations kept coming back to one big worry. And that is what happens to people’s jobs? Larry Fink, who leads BlackRock and served as interim co-chair of the forum, delivered a serious warning during his opening speech. “If AI does to white-collar workers what globalization did to blue-collar workers, we need to confront that reality directly. Not with abstractions about the jobs of tomorrow, but with a credible plan for broad participation in these gains,” he said. Jamie Dimon, who runs JPMorgan, went further, saying governments need plans ready to step in if companies start firing workers en masse because of new technology. Dimon painted a troubling picture of what could happen if self-driving trucks suddenly put 2 million American truck drivers out of work, forcing them to accept much smaller paychecks. “How do you have plans in place to make it work better if in fact [AI] does something terrible … and that’s the only way to do it,” he said, warning that such a scenario could spark widespread anger and unrest. Dario Amodei, head of Anthropic, dropped a bombshell during his Davos appearance, saying the tech world is just “six to 12 months” away from creating an AI system capable of handling nearly everything a software engineer does. Demis Hassabis from Google DeepMind added that this year will likely see AI starting to affect internships and jobs for people just starting their careers. Fink echoed these worries, pointing to analyst roles at law firms and financial companies as particularly vulnerable. Not everyone painted a doom-and-gloom picture. Huang and Roy Jakobs, who leads Royal Philips, both mentioned radiologists as a success story. They explained how these medical professionals are using AI to do their jobs better, and contrary to predictions that their numbers would drop, more radiologists are working now than before. Hassabis also suggested that while some lower-level positions might disappear, the technology could create “new, even more valuable, perhaps more meaningful jobs.” Therapists report rising AI-related anxiety The anxiety isn’t just theoretical. Emma Kobil, who works as a trauma counselor in Denver, has watched AI become a regular topic in therapy sessions over recent years. “I’ve had clients lose their jobs due to AI, and it’s something we’ve processed in our sessions,” Kobil said, noting patients express “shock, disbelief and fear about navigating a changing career landscape where their skills are no longer needed.” Harvey Lieberman, a clinical psychologist working in New York, hears similar concerns. “What I hear most often is a fear of becoming obsolete,” he told CNBC. “People start questioning their judgment, their choices or their future.” The numbers back up these fears. A July 2025 survey from the American Psychological Association found 38% of workers are worried AI will make parts or all of their job outdated. As reported by Cryptopolitan previously, AI played a role in nearly 55,000 layoffs across the U.S. in 2025, out of roughly 1.2 million total job cuts that year. A Massachusetts Institute of Technology study recently concluded that AI could already take over about 11% of American jobs. Marc Benioff of Salesforce revealed his company had let go of 4,000 customer support workers because artificial intelligence was already handling 50% of that work. Tech consulting company Accenture and airline group Lufthansa also cited AI when making recent staffing changes. “People don’t know where they fit into this new society,” said Riana Elyse Anderson, a licensed clinical psychologist and associate professor at Columbia University. “We probably don’t even know the full extent of how psychologically damaging this type of replacement is.” Ben Yalom, a psychotherapist based in San Diego, explained that losing work to AI hits differently than other types of job loss. “It may feel as if the universe is saying, ‘You are no longer needed,’ which may feel much more profound and disturbing than ‘Our company is downsizing,’ or even ‘You are not doing a great job,'” Yalom said. “It goes deeply into questions of personal value, which is all very unsettling.” Skilled traders see opposite trend as white-collar jobs struggle Meanwhile, Mike Rowe is pointing out an interesting twist. Speaking on FOX Business’ “Varney & Co.” on Tuesday, the “Dirty Jobs” host said skilled trade workers face a different reality. “ AI is coming for the coders . It’s not yet coming for the welders, and that basic understanding has taken root,” Rowe said. He noted massive shortages of skilled workers: over 100,000 needed in automotive, 400,000 to 500,000 electricians wanted for BlackRock’s companies alone, and 400,000 positions open in shipbuilding and maritime industries.

For the first time, industry titans including Tesla’s Elon Musk, Nvidia’s Jensen Huang, Anthropic’s Dario Amodei, and Microsoft’s Satya Nadella shared stages and exchanged verbal blows, revealing deep fractures in the AI industry’s united front. This unprecedented convergence marked a pivotal moment where visionary optimism collided with pragmatic concerns about sustainability, ethics, and potential market bubbles. AI Davos 2025: The Transformation of Global Discourse The visual landscape of Davos underwent dramatic changes this year. Major technology corporations commandeered prime real estate along the main promenade, with Meta, Salesforce, and Tata establishing prominent physical presences that overshadowed traditional diplomatic displays. The United States House, jointly sponsored by consulting giant McKinsey and Microsoft, stood as the largest installation, symbolizing the corporate takeover of geopolitical discourse. Meanwhile, critical global issues including climate change and poverty struggled to attract comparable attention, highlighting the forum’s shifting priorities toward technological determinism. This physical transformation reflected a broader conceptual shift: artificial intelligence moved from peripheral discussion to central agenda item, dominating conversations across public panels and private meetings. The Executive Showdown: Visionaries Versus Realists Observers noted unprecedented tension among technology leaders who typically maintain diplomatic public personas. The Davos stage became an arena for subtle—and sometimes overt—competition. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei delivered particularly striking criticism of Nvidia, despite his company’s reliance on their GPU technology. He challenged recent U.S. administration decisions allowing advanced chip exports to China, employing vivid metaphors that captured media attention. “An AI data center represents a country full of geniuses,” Amodei declared, questioning the strategic wisdom of transferring such computational power abroad. This rhetorical flourish exemplified the heightened stakes of AI development, framing technological infrastructure in national security terms. Language and Metaphor: Decoding Executive Rhetoric CEOs employed distinctive terminology that revealed their strategic positioning. Microsoft’s Satya Nadella repeatedly referred to data centers as “token factories,” abstracting complex infrastructure into production terminology that emphasized output and scalability. Jensen Huang framed AI investment primarily through job creation narratives, avoiding discussions about potential slowdowns in infrastructure development. Elon Musk’s presence itself generated significant attention, marking a departure from his previous avoidance of the forum. While his contributions contained less substantive policy discussion than peers, his participation signaled AI’s ascendance as the defining technological narrative of our era. These linguistic choices served as strategic positioning, with each executive advancing frameworks that benefited their corporate interests. The Bubble Question: Growth Versus Sustainability Beneath the optimistic projections lay persistent concerns about artificial intelligence’s economic sustainability. Multiple executives acknowledged the potential for market overextension, though they proposed divergent solutions. Satya Nadella emphasized the necessity of broader adoption, suggesting that limited usage could precipitate a market correction. He advocated for equitable global distribution of AI capabilities, positioning Microsoft as an inclusive infrastructure provider. Conversely, Jensen Huang called for increased investment, arguing that current funding levels insufficiently supported necessary innovation. This tension between expansion and consolidation revealed fundamental disagreements about AI’s developmental trajectory. Industry analysts observed that executives balanced promotional messaging with cautious realism, attempting to sustain investment enthusiasm while acknowledging practical constraints. Key AI Executive Positions at Davos 2025 Executive Company Primary Focus Notable Statement Satya Nadella Microsoft Broad adoption & equity “Token factories” need widespread usage Jensen Huang Nvidia Investment & job creation Current investment levels insufficient Dario Amodei Anthropic Geopolitical implications AI data centers as “countries of geniuses” Elon Musk Tesla/X Platform participation Previously avoided, now engaged Geopolitical Dimensions: Technology as Power The Davos discussions consistently transcended pure technology, intersecting with international relations and trade policy. Amodei’s criticism of chip exports to China exemplified this convergence, framing computational hardware as strategic assets with national security implications. This perspective gained traction among policymakers attending the forum, who increasingly view AI development through competitive geopolitical lenses. The technology’s dual-use potential—for both economic advancement and strategic advantage—complicates traditional trade relationships and export controls. These discussions occurred against a backdrop of ongoing U.S.-China technological competition, with AI representing the latest frontier in great power rivalry. European leaders expressed particular concern about dependency on American and Chinese AI ecosystems, proposing regulatory frameworks and investment strategies to ensure regional competitiveness. The Talent Wars: Human Capital in AI Development Beyond hardware and investment, executives addressed the critical human dimension of AI advancement. The competition for specialized talent emerged as a recurring subtext throughout discussions. Companies balance aggressive recruitment against financial sustainability, creating tension between expansion and profitability. This talent competition explains some public disagreements, as executives position their organizations as optimal environments for groundbreaking research. The concentration of expertise in few corporations and regions raises concerns about equitable knowledge distribution and innovation diversity. Several executives proposed educational initiatives and international collaboration frameworks to address talent shortages, though concrete commitments remained limited. Visual and Structural Changes: Corporate Dominance The physical environment of Davos 2025 provided tangible evidence of technology’s rising influence. Traditional national pavilions shared space with elaborate corporate installations featuring interactive demonstrations and networking spaces. This shift generated debate about the World Economic Forum’s evolving identity—whether it primarily serves as a platform for multilateral diplomacy or corporate engagement. The prominent technology presence attracted different participant demographics than previous years, with increased attendance from venture capitalists, startup founders, and technical specialists. This changing composition influenced discussion topics and networking dynamics, further emphasizing technology’s centrality to contemporary global challenges. Conclusion The AI Davos 2025 discussions revealed an industry at a critical inflection point, where unprecedented technological promise confronts practical limitations and internal divisions. The simultaneous presence of competing CEOs created unique transparency about strategic disagreements that typically remain behind corporate walls. While executives universally acknowledged artificial intelligence’s transformative potential, they diverged significantly on implementation pathways, ethical frameworks, and economic sustainability. These debates extend beyond corporate boardrooms, influencing policy decisions, investment patterns, and international relations. As artificial intelligence continues its rapid advancement, the tensions exposed at Davos will likely intensify, requiring more sophisticated frameworks for balancing innovation with responsibility, competition with collaboration, and ambition with realism. FAQs Q1: Why was Davos 2025 particularly significant for AI discussions? The 2025 forum marked unprecedented convergence of major tech CEOs including Musk, Huang, Amodei, and Nadella, who publicly debated AI’s future while revealing strategic tensions typically kept private. Q2: What were the main points of disagreement among tech executives? Key disagreements involved AI’s economic sustainability, appropriate investment levels, geopolitical implications of technology transfer, and whether to prioritize broad adoption versus concentrated advancement. Q3: How did the physical environment of Davos change in 2025? Technology corporations dominated the main promenade with elaborate installations, while traditional diplomatic displays received less prominence, visually representing tech’s rising influence in global discourse. Q4: What geopolitical concerns emerged regarding AI development? Executives and policymakers expressed concerns about strategic technology transfers, particularly regarding advanced chip exports to China, framing AI infrastructure as national security assets. Q5: How did executives address concerns about an AI bubble? While acknowledging potential overextension, leaders proposed different solutions—Nadella emphasized broader adoption, Huang called for more investment, and Amodei focused on geopolitical controls.

Many now focus on the cost of building a large SHIB position today. Others weigh whether future market recovery could significantly lift valuations by 2030. The debate reflects broader uncertainty about the durability of meme cryptocurrencies. Cost of Buying 100 Million SHIB at Current Prices Shiba Inu hit an all-time high of $0.00008845 in October 2021. Since then, the token has fallen about 91% from that peak. At its current price of roughly $0.00000781, SHIB trades near multi-year lows. This decline has reshaped entry costs for long-term holders. At today’s valuation, purchasing 100 million SHIB costs about $781. Market comparisons highlight how sharply prices have shifted. In December 2025, when SHIB traded near $0.000033, the same amount cost around $3,300. Supporters say this reduced entry level improves upside potential if prices rebound over time. The prolonged downturns often attract accumulation strategies. SHIB’s continued visibility and strong trading volumes. However, they also stress that price recovery depends on broader market cycles. SHIB remains closely correlated with overall crypto sentiment. Despite its losses, Shiba Inu stays among the most-watched meme cryptocurrencies. Community size and brand recognition continue to drive interest. Still, observers caution that popularity alone does not guarantee sustainable growth. Structural factors increasingly shape investor expectations. 2030 Price Forecasts and Portfolio Value Outlook Price forecasts for Shiba Inu in 2030 differ widely across research platforms. Finder’s panel projected SHIB could reach $0.0001971 by 2030. This scenario implies a 2,382% increase from current levels. Under that estimate, 100 million SHIB would be worth about $19,710. Changelly offered a more conservative projection. Its estimates place SHIB between $0.0000458 and $0.0000532 by 2030. This range would value a 100 million SHIB holding between $4,580 and $5,320. Telegaon presented a broader outlook, forecasting prices between $0.0000919 and $0.000124. At the upper level, today’s $794 investment could rise to roughly $12,400. Broader market expectations also influence these forecasts. ARK Invest, led by Cathie Wood, projected the total crypto market could reach $28 trillion by 2030. Analysts linked this outlook to the expansion of blockchain adoption. They said major assets and select altcoins, including SHIB, could benefit if this growth materializes. Optimism has also emerged around a possible spot SHIB ETF. Grayscale recently identified SHIB as eligible under the SEC’s Generic Listing Standard framework. Market observers referenced Bitcoin and Ethereum price rallies following ETF inflows. However, critics continue to highlight slow development, limited transparency, and SHIB’s massive supply as constraints on long-term gains.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-24 20:30:12

The next significant move for LINK largely depends on Bitcoin’s momentum, with bulls and bears waiting for a clear signal before committing. Until then, the market is in a holding pattern, building tension for the breakout or breakdown. Traders Await Clear Direction For Chainlink According to an update from CryptoWzrd, the daily candles for both Chainlink and LINKBTC continue to print indecisive price action, reflecting a lack of strong conviction from either side of the market. Despite recent movements, neither buyers nor sellers have been able to establish a clear directional edge, keeping the broader outlook neutral for now. Related Reading: Chainlink Drops To $12.50, But Largest Whales Are Accumulating To gain a reliable directional bias and unlock higher-probability trade opportunities, healthier and more decisive daily candles are required, as price could continue to chop within its current range. Bitcoin is expected to remain the primary driver of the next significant move. In particular, LINKBTC needs to print another bullish daily candle in the coming week to maintain any constructive momentum. Failure to do so could shift the balance back in favor of the bears and increase downside pressure. A continuation of weakness would likely result in a break of the daily lower-high trendline, followed by a loss of the critical $12 support level. On the bullish side, if Bitcoin provides the necessary support, LINK could attempt a recovery rally toward the $16 resistance zone. Until a clearer higher-timeframe structure emerges, the trading focus remains tactical. Attention will be placed on the lower-timeframe charts, particularly over the weekend, to capitalize on quick, short-term opportunities while avoiding unnecessary exposure to indecisive daily conditions. Intraday Chart Shows Tight Range, Market Lacks Clear Direction The analyst concluded that the intraday chart remains choppy, with price action tightly compressed within a narrow range. Such conditions point to persistent market indecision, in which neither bulls nor bears have shown sufficient conviction to drive a sustained move in either direction. As a result, trade setups lack clarity and carry elevated risk. Related Reading: Chainlink Stuck In A Micro-Range As Traders Await A Clear Trigger From a tactical perspective, a retest of the $13 resistance level, followed by clear signs of rejection or fading momentum, could open the door to a short opportunity. However, if price holds above $13 with strong acceptance, that would place the market in more constructive territory and tilt the bias back in favor of the bulls. Until one of these scenarios plays out decisively, the analyst emphasized the importance of waiting. A more mature and well-defined chart structure is needed before engaging in the next trade, ensuring better confirmation, cleaner entries, and improved risk-to-reward conditions.

Vertical Aerospace, based in the United Kingdom, displayed its Valo aircraft in Manhattan. The company’s chairman, Dómhnal Slattery, says these flying vehicles are intended to expand beyond wealthy travelers who can afford expensive helicopter rides. Aiming for affordable air travel with electric power “This is not for the affluent, or the super affluent, which is where helicopters have been forever. We want to democratize urban air mobility,” Slattery told Yahoo Finance. The Valo aircraft has a wingspan of nearly 50 feet and can carry up to six passengers along with a pilot and their bags. That makes it bigger than other flying taxis currently under development by competing companies. The aircraft runs entirely on electricity and has eight rotors that let i t ta ke off straight up like a helicopter. Once airborne, four propellers in the front spin 90 degrees to push the vehicle forward for regular flight. According to the company, the electric motors make much less noise than traditional helicopters. Vertical Aerospace designed the Valo for trips of 100 miles or less. The company expects the aircraft to make several short flights between charges rather than one long journey. Slattery said the company aims to charge around the same price as an Uber Black service for each seat when the cabin is set up for six people. “That opens up the mass market,” he explained. Right now, an Uber Black ride from downtown Manhattan to John F. Kennedy International Airport costs about $150, though prices can go higher during busy times. Slattery maintains that running on electricity instead of fuel makes the Valo cheaper to operate than regular helicopters. Traditional helicopters create noise and air pollution, need repairs more often, and require more room to take off and land. The aircraft shown in New York will soon begin the approval process with European aviation officials. Slattery says European rules are tougher than those from the Federal Aviation Administration in the United States. “What we’re revealing tonight is the certificatio n ai rplane; this is what you’re physically seeing out there,” Slattery said about the displayed vehicle. He sai d th e approval process will start next year. Getting approved requires provin g th e aircraft is safe and reliable . Slattery, who spent years working in the aircraft leasing business, say s pa ssengers also need to feel confident about flying in these vehicles. “We want to really sho w th ese things are safe; I need to convince people that this becomes as safe as a Boeing 737, because commercial aviation is the safest form of transport in the world,” Slattery said. “W e al l have worked hard in the industry to achieve that (safety) metric. And so in this industry, proving safety and showing safety is what will make the difference over the next decade.” Airline partnerships and route planning underway Vertical Aerospace has partnered with American Airlines and Japan Airlines. The company hopes to receive full certification by 2028 and begin operating flights that year. However, the company won’t actually run the passenger services. Instead, it plans to operate as a manufacturer like Boeing or Airbus, building aircraft that airlines and other operators will use to serve customers. The company plans to offer flying taxi services in London. In the New York area, Vertical Aerospace is working with Bristow Group , a major helicopter transportation company, and Skyports Infrastructure, which runs heliports around New York City. Together, they’re planning routes that would connect New York City to Newark and Teterboro airports in New Jersey, as well as JFK and East Hampton Airport. Some companies already provide helicopter airport transfers. Blade, which Joby Aviation owns, currently uses regular helicopters but plans to switch to its own electric aircraft eventually. Competition among flying taxi companies will be fierce, and Vertical Aerospace is betting that the Valo’s size, speed, and distance capabilities will provide a competitive edge.

Here’s What Analysts Think,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/can-any-new-crypto-repeat-what-dogecoin-did-in-its-prime-heres-what-analysts-think/,"The most iconic rally of the 2021 bull run was Dogecoin’s 10,000% rise, which many believe only history can record. However, a new crypto has emerged with the potential to record a historic rally of this nature. The newcomer is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is currently priced at $0.04 in Phase 7 of its presale and has already shown explosive demand to raise a monumental $19.95 million from a group of 18,880+ investors. Mutuum Finance has offered real utility to investors in the crypto market. An investment of $100 in this crypto asset currently in Phase 7 of its presale can potentially rise to $10,000 if Mutuum Finance repeats Dogecoin’s 10,000% rise. Dogecoin Faces the Challenge of Volatility Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to be in an extremely volatile state as indicated by the recent liquidation situation wherein over $1.2 million in leveraged positions was liquidated due to the asset’s recent decline. This has left many DOGE investors vulnerable and in losses. While the crypto was once a top player in the market, its momentum is gone. Investors are now turning to a new crypto that could turn their fate around. Project Valuation & ROI Analysis While speculative in nature, the analysis of the potential of MUTM according to the presale performance can offer an understanding of the growth pattern of the token. To attain the target of achieving a growth of 10,000% from the current price of the token in Phase 7, which is $0.04, the new target price of the token will be $4. While ambitious, the target is justified given the project’s capability to attract substantial market attention. Presale Defining Market Confidence Mutuum Finance’s presale model has set the standard for successful early-stage growth. The token is showing remarkable potential as it grows by an impressive 4x, rising from its initial value of $0.01 to its current value of $0.04 in presale phase 7. The potential is high due to the token’s listing price of $0.06. An initial investment of $4,000 is set to rise to $6,000 after the listing, providing an instant gain of $2,000. Over 18,880 investors have put in $19.95 million into the project. This makes the MUTM the next crypto to explode. Dual Rewards: Incentivizing a Liquid Ecosystem Mutuum Finance uses an advanced two-level incentive mechanism that rewards all participants in the ecosystem. This mechanism allows for higher returns to liquidity providers. By depositing USDT into Peer to Contract with a base APY of 8%, an additional incentive of 6% APY in the form of MUTM tokens may be earned, increasing the returns to as much as 14%. On the other hand, borrowers may benefit from incentives such as earning a rebate of 4% APY in the form of MUTM for borrowing $10,000 in USDC with an interest rate of 9%, effectively lowering the borrowing rate to 5%. This incentive mechanism is financed through an allocation of 10% of the entire MUTM token supply. Project Stability The core element of the Mutuum Finance system is its system of risk management that guarantees the stability of the system while providing capital security for the user. The protocol applies a system of dynamically changing Loan-to-Value ratios in real-time according to the changing nature of the markets. For assets like SOL or USDC, which can be defined as blue-chip assets, the LTV can go up to 70% while the liquidation occurs at 75%. This would then allow a user holding an SOL worth $8,000 as collateral to access up to $5,600 in liquidity. Mutuum Finance, which has the symbol MUTM, has the potential to mirror the legendary 10,000% growth that Dogecoin has witnessed in the past. At $0.04 during its presale, backed by a whopping $19.95 million in demand, it has the potential to explode in the near future. A $100 investment in the token has the potential to rise to $10,000 should its valuation rise to $4, making it the next crypto to explode in the near future.

Here’s Why",https://timestabloid.com/expert-says-xrp-wont-be-worth-any-less-than-1000-by-2030-heres-why/,"Crypto markets test conviction like few other asset classes. Years of volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and shifting narratives have forced many investors to reassess their long-term beliefs. XRP has endured all of this while remaining one of the most debated digital assets in the industry. Yet, for some builders and industry leaders, the long-term case for XRP has only strengthened as the underlying financial infrastructure continues to evolve. That conviction recently resurfaced after Dominic Kwok, co-founder of EasyA, shared a pointed long-term outlook on X. Kwok’s statement blended humor with resolve, but its foundation rested on a serious thesis. As a Web3 educator and ecosystem builder deeply embedded in blockchain development, Kwok framed XRP’s future value as a function of structural utility rather than market sentiment. His remarks resonated widely because they echoed a view increasingly held among long-term XRP proponents. fyi i did not go grey at the age of 30 for $XRP to be worth any less than $1,000 by 2030 — Dom Kwok | EasyA (@dom_kwok) January 23, 2026 XRP’s Role in Future Financial Infrastructure XRP was engineered to solve liquidity inefficiencies in global finance . Its primary function as a bridge asset allows institutions to move value across borders instantly and at low cost. Supporters argue that if XRP becomes embedded in large-scale payment flows, tokenized asset settlement, and institutional liquidity corridors, its valuation must reflect utility-driven demand, not speculative cycles. In high-volume financial systems, assets that facilitate settlement often require higher unit prices to handle large transfers efficiently. From this perspective, price appreciation supports functionality rather than hype. Supply Dynamics and Liquidity Constraints Critics often reject four-figure XRP projections by citing market capitalization limits. Advocates counter that this view oversimplifies supply mechanics. While XRP’s total supply is capped , the liquid supply available on exchanges continues to decline due to long-term holding, institutional custody, escrow mechanisms, and reduced speculative float. As adoption scales, constrained liquidity could amplify price pressure rather than dilute it. In that framework, higher prices enable XRP to move significant value without destabilizing markets.

Institutions can now engage with XRP without existential legal risk, unlocking pathways for ETFs, custody solutions, and enterprise-grade settlement products. This shift reframes XRP from a legally uncertain asset into a compliant financial infrastructure. For industry builders like Kwok, regulation no longer suppresses XRP’s potential. Instead, it legitimizes its role within regulated markets. Conviction Over Certainty Kwok’s assertion does not promise timelines or guarantees. It reflects a high-conviction belief grounded in infrastructure, liquidity mechanics, and long-term adoption trends. Whether XRP ultimately reaches $1,000 by 2030 remains uncertain. What is clear is that leaders embedded in Web3 development increasingly view XRP not through short-term charts, but through the lens of a financial system still under construction.

The money was approved by Congress in 2021 to help states build EV infrastructure. But in February 2026, after Sean Duffy took over as Transportation Secretary, the Department of Transportation shut down access to the funds without going through proper legal steps. That triggered a lawsuit from 20 Democratic-led states and Washington D.C. The case was heard in Seattle by U.S. District Judge Tana Lin. Lin said the DOT and Federal Highway Administration “yanked the NEVI Formula Program’s cord out of the outlet” without following the rules laid out in administrative law. Judge issues permanent order against transportation department The judge didn’t just scold them. She issued a permanent order stopping the Transportation Department from taking back funds or canceling plans already approved. That means states can move ahead with the projects they planned, using money Congress already gave them. Environmental groups like the Sierra Club were happy with the ruling. So were the states. Mike Faulk, who speaks for Washington Attorney General Nick Brown, said, “Judge Lin’s order is a resounding win for the rule of law and for smart investment in our clean energy future.” The $5 billion program was part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, signed by Biden in 2021. It’s called the NEVI program and was set up to help states build a national network of EV chargers. States like California, Colorado, and Washington had already made their plans and were awarded the funds. But as soon as Duffy took office under President Donald Trump, the DOT suddenly stopped the money from flowing. The Trump administration claimed it was just a temporary pause. But that pause came without any legal process. Lin didn’t buy the excuse. She said the law didn’t allow for any kind of pause, even a short one. “In short, Defendants defied the will of Congress by withholding funds in a manner not contemplated by the IIJA,” she wrote. That earlier pause had already drawn fire from the court. A preliminary injunction forced the DOT to issue new guidance. Still, by then, a lot of damage had already been done. Projects were delayed. States were left hanging. Now the case is likely to cause more fights in Congress. The Senate is expected next week to take up a bill that would shift $879 million, money meant for EV charging, to other kinds of infrastructure. That bill already passed the House. If it passes the Senate too, some of the EV money could be rerouted despite the court’s ruling. The Trump administration has also been rolling out other steps to push gas-powered cars over electric ones. It’s been cutting EV tax breaks for buyers and backing automakers that focus on fuel engines. This court ruling won’t stop that. But it does mean the government can’t mess with state funding that was already approved. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Long known for its speed, low transaction costs, and enterprise-grade reliability, the Ledger is now expanding beyond payments to data-driven and automated financial applications. By merging AI with decentralized settlement, Ripple is positioning the Ledger to support smarter workflows and more efficient liquidity management. How Ripple Is Embedding Intelligence Into On-Chain Systems An analyst known as SMQKE on X has shared a case study of an AI implementation in the cross-border payment, in which Ripple has successfully combined blockchain technology and artificial intelligence to enhance the efficiency, speed, and cost-effectiveness of global transactions. As a leading provider of real-time cross-border payment solutions, Ripple leverages the XRP Ledger, a decentralized blockchain that enables real-time cross-border settlement.

BlackRock is now using Ripple’s RLUSD as collateral, which is extremely bullish for XRP. JackTheRippler revealed that the altcoin is being positioned as the future infrastructure, which is being built with the potential to hit over $10,000 per coin. With the REAL token launching on January 26th, trillions in global capital could flood into the XRP Ledger. According to JackTheRippler, some projections suggest up to $800 billion could flow into the REAL token on XRP Ledger, potentially sparking a powerful supply shock .

However, a technical breakdown shared by crypto analyst ChartNerd argued that what looks like stagnation may actually be the final preparation phase before a historic move. The price structure suggests something far bigger that sends XRP on its most aggressive rally in eight years, but the implications only become clear when the full setup is examined. Related Reading: Bitcoin Influencers Get Spotlight In X’s New ‘Starterpacks’ A 400-Day Rectangular Reaccumulation Still Holding Structure According to technical analysis done by ChartNerd, XRP’s price action has been locked inside a rectangular reaccumulation zone for about 400 days, and this has led to the formation of what looks like a rectangular bull flag on a macro timeframe. The technical chart shows a strong impulsive move from July 2024 to December 2024 acting as the flagpole, right when XRP peaked at the $3.4 price zone back then. This impulsive flagpole has been followed by a long period of sideways trading where XRP’s price has repeatedly respected a clearly defined support around $1.8 and resistance boundaries around $3.6. This type of structure is associated with reaccumulation within the support and resistance zones, especially when it is playing out after a sharp expansion move and holding for this length of time. Each dip into reaccumulation support has been absorbed, preventing any sustained breakdown and keeping the broader pattern intact. ChartNerd noted that the rectangular flag will be valid as long as this support level is defended, and this will activate the expansion journey. XRP Price Chart. Source: @ChartNerdTA on X Macro Breakout Projection Puts XRP Price Target At $23 According to ChartNerd, bearish participants are increasingly pressured by the fact that this fractal is still holding despite repeated attempts to invalidate it. The longer XRP’s price action is trapped inside the rectangle without breaking down, the more likely it becomes that the eventual resolution favors the dominant trend that preceded the consolidation. In this case, that trend was bullish, which strengthens the case for an upside breakout once resistance is cleared. If the rectangular bull flag resolves to the upside as projected, the chart outlines a breakout trajectory that would carry XRP into double-digit territory, with a long-term target region near $23. This price target projection is derived from the height of the flagpole extended from the top of the reaccumulation range. Related Reading: Crypto Meets Private Banking: UBS Weighs New Offering ChartNerd labelled this possible move as one of the most aggressive rallies XRP could see in seven to eight years. At the time of writing, XRP is trading around $1.92, meaning a move toward the $23 region would represent a gain of over 1,000% from current levels, which is a type of percentage expansion XRP has played out well in the past.
