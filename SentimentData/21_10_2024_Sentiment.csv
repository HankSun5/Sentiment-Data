Notably, this inflow has seen FLOKI breaking out of a descending trendline that has served as the peak of its rallies since June. This breakout is seen as a key technical development, with crypto analyst World Of Charts emphasizing it as a strong bullish signal. According to the analyst, the breakout opens the trend for the meme coin to continue the run toward a new all-time high. Related Reading: TRON Market Cap Hits Nearly $14 Billion On Strong Revenue Growth FLOKI Ready For 200% Surge Past All-Time High Although it was launched in 2021, FLOKI rose to prominence earlier this year after it went on a 1,100% increase over five months to peak at a new all-time high of $0.0003449. As it stands, the meme coin has corrected by around 55% from this all-time high. However, according to analysis and prediction from crypto analyst World Of Charts, this correction is about to end and the $0.0003449 all-time high might not hold for long anymore. World Of Charts shared his analysis on the social media platform X, posting a daily candlestick chart of the FLOKI / TetherUS trading pair. The chart reveals that the meme coin has just broken above the resistance trendline of a bullish pennant flag pattern, which the meme coin has been trading within since hitting its all-time high. In terms of the projected price trajectory, the analyst believes FLOKI is on course for another breakout that could not only exceed the previous all-time high but also push toward a price point just below $0.0005. To reach this point, FLOKI would have to go on a 210% rally from the current price level. $Floki #Floki Finally Breaking Out Send It Towards New Ath🚀 https://t.co/I2sVnrx94X pic.twitter.com/LNsAHKe1Q0 — World Of Charts (@WorldOfCharts1) October 19, 2024 Is A 200% Rally Possible For FLOKI? At the time of writing, FLOKI is trading at $0.0001554 and is still up by 12% in the past seven days. According to data from on-chain analytics platform Santiment, FLOKI and other meme coins are witnessing the highest level of interest and mentions across social media platforms in five months. This interesting trend is brought about by the new interest in Dogecoin, which has naturally flowed into other meme coins. Given this heightened attention and the bullish technical setup highlighted by analysts, a 200% rally is within the realm of possibility. FLOKI has already shown it can achieve significant gains in a short timeframe, having previously posted an impressive 1,100% increase earlier this year. If the current social buzz and market dynamics continue to favor meme coins, FLOKI could break through its resistance levels and embark on another explosive rally to deliver a 200% increase before the end of the year.

Analyst Predicts 200% Price Hike – Details,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/shiba-inu-to-double-analyst-predicts-200-price-hike-details/,"Although flying under the radar concerning price movements during Bitcoin’s recent bull run, the dog-themed cryptocurrency Shiba Inu (SHIB) was able to appreciate 8.18% in the last week while Bitcoin reclaimed the $69,000 mark on Friday. Analysts have already predicted further upward potential for this meme coin. Related Reading: Could Bitcoin Break $100,000? Analysts Predict 6-Figure Milestone Analyst Predicts 200% Surge For Shiba Inu Crypto analyst MMBTtrader seems rather positive about the future prospects of Shiba Inu as he expects a 200% increase to $0.000038. As he says, the SHIB had already registered a 75% gain from the $0.000011 support level within the price chart. The altcoin had indeed rallied from the demand zone in the early periods of August and September, accelerated its pace, and settled at $0.000019. For SHIB, MMBTtrader predicts that it will not just consolidate to $0.00003852. As a matter of fact, he expects the higher highs and higher lows pattern where the initial push to May’s highs at $0.000028 will then be corrected to September’s highs at $0.000021. In case those levels hold, the meme coin could pull to the targeted $0.00003852. Conflicting Views: Bearish Outlook From SwallowPremium MMBTtrader still remains bullish about Shiba Inu, but SwallowPremium, on the other hand, is a little more conservative. He says that the cryptocurrency would continue to go up until it hits $0.0000216, and then correct 35% down to $0.000014075. His analysis reads that the downtrend would be triggered by a correction down to $0.0000195, which may be a good time to open a short position. However, Premium also cautions that if SHIB breaks over the price of $0.0000216, a bearish outlook could be invalidated, sending the price much higher than what it has already recorded. Related Reading: TRON Market Cap Hits Nearly $14 Billion On Strong Revenue Growth Shiba Inu’s Price Path Forward Shiba Inu trades at $0.00001925, close to 11% below the level of $0.0000216 resistance. Various predictions made by market experts convey a divergence of sentiment on SHIB trajectory. MMBTtrader projection for a possible 100% increase is based on an underlying conviction for perpetuation of an upward trend. SwallowPremium sounds a note of caution with a ‘critic’ view of correcting it. Shiba Inu’s future price action depends on breaking key resistance levels and maintaining momentum. As SHIB nears crucial price points, traders will watch for breakout signs. The coming weeks will be critical in determining whether it can rise further or face another rejection.

The wallet’s re-activation comes at an exciting time when Bitcoin’s price briefly hits $69k. Dormant Bitcoin Address Boasts 25 BTC According to Whale Alert, the BTC wallet held 25 BTC, which was valued at $1.71 million. This wallet has been inactive since 2013 when Bitcoin’s value hovered between $100 and $266. It was an exciting and tumultuous year for Bitcoin, as its price dropped to $50 before recovering to $100. With Bitcoin’s value at less than $1,000, the wallet’s owner holds a sizable stash after the coin’s meteoric rise in the last few years. 💤 A dormant address containing 25 #BTC (1,711,020 USD) has just been activated after 10.8 years!https://t.co/jb4vDe7CLO — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) October 18, 2024 The whale’s reactivation of the wallet comes when Bitcoin’s price hit $69,000. This isn’t the first time that BTC flirted with this level. If we can remember, Bitcoin rallied to over $70,000 in July, setting up a crypto frenzy in the industry. While Bitcoin failed to sustain its $69k price, it remains solid, staying within the $68k to $69k level in the last few days. Speculators and industry watchers also expect BTC to hit the $70k level soon, backed by the increasing demand for crypto. Bitcoin traded at the $70k level on June 12th. BTC Pulls Back This week, Bitcoin failed to sustain its momentum and has slightly dipped to $68,399 after hitting a high of $68,689. According to Bloomberg, BTC investors have added over $1.8 billion this week to spot Bitcoin ETFs. Related Reading: Could Bitcoin Break $100,000? Analysts Predict 6-Figure Milestone The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gave the go-signal to BTC ETFs, which led to a frenzy of buying and inflows. Demand outpaced supply thanks to the SEC’s approval, boosting the coin’s price to over $73,797. Then, there was a pullback in early August, with the price falling by 30% before starting another rally. The expanding crypto business relies on Bitcoin and crypto whales. They own a lot of crypto, and the media follows them. The behaviors of BTC whales, which Whale Alert tracks, often cause a stir.

ETH could continue to rise toward $2,850 if it clears the $2,750 resistance zone. Ethereum remained in a positive zone above the $2,580 and $2,620 resistance levels. The price is trading above $2,650 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $2,680 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move up if it clears the $2,750 and $2,780 resistance levels. Ethereum Price Aims For More Gains Ethereum price remained stable above the $2,600 level like Bitcoin. ETH extended gains above the $2,650 resistance level to move further into a positive zone. The price cleared the $2,700 level and tested $2,765. A high was formed at $2,765 and the price is now consolidating gains. There was a minor decline below the $2,740 level, but the price is stable above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,576 swing low to the $2,765 high. Ethereum price is now trading above $2,650 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support near $2,680 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The trend line is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,576 swing low to the $2,765 high. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,750 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,765 level. A clear move above the $2,765 resistance might send the price toward the $2,840 resistance. An upside break above the $2,840 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,880 resistance zone in the near term. The next hurdle sits near the $2,920 level or $2,950. Another Drop In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,750 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,720 level. The first major support sits near the $2,680 zone and the trend line. A clear move below the $2,720 support might push the price toward $2,650. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,620 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,550.

This is based on historical price actions because XRP can be seen rallying within such a time frame. Though the targets appear quite ambitious, he uses previous performance as a sign for future gain and is setting up major growth opportunities for the owners of XRP. Related Reading: Could Bitcoin Break $100,000? Analysts Predict 6-Figure Milestone According to crypto expert Egrag Crypto, XRP, which is currently trading at $0.53, has experienced impressive surges of 3,300% and 700% at different times, suggesting that significant price movements could happen as we approach March 1, 2025, or even sooner in the first quarter. Crucially, these forecasts are backed by technical analysis, chart patterns, and liquidity assessments, rather than mere optimism. #XRP Bifrost Bridge ($6.4 & $27 Targets): I know 95% of the #XRPArmy is feeling exhausted from the ongoing #SEC manipulation and the appeals process, which has been overwhelming due to misleading submissions and numerous delays. 😩⚖️ But forget all of that noise! 🔇 The real… pic.twitter.com/FQ6mOe83ET — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) October 18, 2024 Technical Analysis And Market Sentiment The forecast is mostly on-chain metrics about Bifrost Bridge moving up, almost in the same direction with big stocks as that of FANGMAN. FANGMAN includes seven of the biggest tech companies or tech mega-caps of the world — Meta (Facebook), Amazon, Netflix, Alphabet (Google), Microsoft, Apple and Nvidia. FANGMAN stocks are high alpha counters, which usually depend on growth and future guidance. This comparison says that even if it’s going through tough regulations and issues with the courts, XRP might be one of the biggest long-term benefits an investor could ever have by closing out the noise and just focusing on the data. This move will have the pending case in the SEC cast as a huge boulder for the investors in XRP, with constant appeals and delays testing the patience of many investors. However, Egrag urges the XRP Army to keep moving forward with undivided attention. Instead, it’s important to focus on these cycles and levels of liquidity since they are actually capable of providing various positive insights concerning long-term price trends. With this in mind, the wise investor would be able to determine the direction XRP’s price is headed. A Resilient XRP Community The litigation to be heard against the SEC will take time, but the battle will prove to be short-term when one weighs this against the long-term potential of the cryptocurrency. What is different about the XRP community, which calls itself the XRP Army, from many other crypto communities, is its strength and resilience. Where the crypto communities often flinch before a challenge, the XRP Army holds the line in arguing for the utility value of XRP in real-world applications. These analysts believe the community is flexible, emotionally supportive, and forward-looking, making them one of the most informed groups in the cryptocurrency landscape.

Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.5880 resistance or even $0.5925 in the near term. The next major hurdle might be $0.6000. Another Drop? If XRP fails to clear the $0.5550 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.540 level. The next major support is near the $0.5380 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.5380 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $0.5320 support in the near term. The next major support sits near the $0.5250 zone.
