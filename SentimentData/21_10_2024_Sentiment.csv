Notably, this inflow has seen FLOKI breaking out of a descending trendline that has served as the peak of its rallies since June. This breakout is seen as a key technical development, with crypto analyst World Of Charts emphasizing it as a strong bullish signal. According to the analyst, the breakout opens the trend for the meme coin to continue the run toward a new all-time high. Related Reading: TRON Market Cap Hits Nearly $14 Billion On Strong Revenue Growth FLOKI Ready For 200% Surge Past All-Time High Although it was launched in 2021, FLOKI rose to prominence earlier this year after it went on a 1,100% increase over five months to peak at a new all-time high of $0.0003449. As it stands, the meme coin has corrected by around 55% from this all-time high. However, according to analysis and prediction from crypto analyst World Of Charts, this correction is about to end and the $0.0003449 all-time high might not hold for long anymore. World Of Charts shared his analysis on the social media platform X, posting a daily candlestick chart of the FLOKI / TetherUS trading pair. The chart reveals that the meme coin has just broken above the resistance trendline of a bullish pennant flag pattern, which the meme coin has been trading within since hitting its all-time high. In terms of the projected price trajectory, the analyst believes FLOKI is on course for another breakout that could not only exceed the previous all-time high but also push toward a price point just below $0.0005. To reach this point, FLOKI would have to go on a 210% rally from the current price level. $Floki #Floki Finally Breaking Out Send It Towards New Ath🚀 https://t.co/I2sVnrx94X pic.twitter.com/LNsAHKe1Q0 — World Of Charts (@WorldOfCharts1) October 19, 2024 Is A 200% Rally Possible For FLOKI? At the time of writing, FLOKI is trading at $0.0001554 and is still up by 12% in the past seven days. According to data from on-chain analytics platform Santiment, FLOKI and other meme coins are witnessing the highest level of interest and mentions across social media platforms in five months. This interesting trend is brought about by the new interest in Dogecoin, which has naturally flowed into other meme coins. Given this heightened attention and the bullish technical setup highlighted by analysts, a 200% rally is within the realm of possibility. FLOKI has already shown it can achieve significant gains in a short timeframe, having previously posted an impressive 1,100% increase earlier this year. If the current social buzz and market dynamics continue to favor meme coins, FLOKI could break through its resistance levels and embark on another explosive rally to deliver a 200% increase before the end of the year.

Analyst Predicts 200% Price Hike – Details,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/shiba-inu-to-double-analyst-predicts-200-price-hike-details/,"Although flying under the radar concerning price movements during Bitcoin’s recent bull run, the dog-themed cryptocurrency Shiba Inu (SHIB) was able to appreciate 8.18% in the last week while Bitcoin reclaimed the $69,000 mark on Friday. Analysts have already predicted further upward potential for this meme coin. Related Reading: Could Bitcoin Break $100,000? Analysts Predict 6-Figure Milestone Analyst Predicts 200% Surge For Shiba Inu Crypto analyst MMBTtrader seems rather positive about the future prospects of Shiba Inu as he expects a 200% increase to $0.000038. As he says, the SHIB had already registered a 75% gain from the $0.000011 support level within the price chart. The altcoin had indeed rallied from the demand zone in the early periods of August and September, accelerated its pace, and settled at $0.000019. For SHIB, MMBTtrader predicts that it will not just consolidate to $0.00003852. As a matter of fact, he expects the higher highs and higher lows pattern where the initial push to May’s highs at $0.000028 will then be corrected to September’s highs at $0.000021. In case those levels hold, the meme coin could pull to the targeted $0.00003852. Conflicting Views: Bearish Outlook From SwallowPremium MMBTtrader still remains bullish about Shiba Inu, but SwallowPremium, on the other hand, is a little more conservative. He says that the cryptocurrency would continue to go up until it hits $0.0000216, and then correct 35% down to $0.000014075. His analysis reads that the downtrend would be triggered by a correction down to $0.0000195, which may be a good time to open a short position. However, Premium also cautions that if SHIB breaks over the price of $0.0000216, a bearish outlook could be invalidated, sending the price much higher than what it has already recorded. Related Reading: TRON Market Cap Hits Nearly $14 Billion On Strong Revenue Growth Shiba Inu’s Price Path Forward Shiba Inu trades at $0.00001925, close to 11% below the level of $0.0000216 resistance. Various predictions made by market experts convey a divergence of sentiment on SHIB trajectory. MMBTtrader projection for a possible 100% increase is based on an underlying conviction for perpetuation of an upward trend. SwallowPremium sounds a note of caution with a ‘critic’ view of correcting it. Shiba Inu’s future price action depends on breaking key resistance levels and maintaining momentum. As SHIB nears crucial price points, traders will watch for breakout signs. The coming weeks will be critical in determining whether it can rise further or face another rejection.

Today, many websites and social media users track these wallets and their most recent transactions. Related Reading: 100% Uptick For Shiba Inu? Experts Eye Global Reversal As Catalyst Last October 19th, 2024, at 5:45 am, Whale Alert shared that a dormant BTC address with 25 Bitcoins valued at $1,711,020 was activated after more than 10 years of inactivity. The wallet’s re-activation comes at an exciting time when Bitcoin’s price briefly hits $69k. Dormant Bitcoin Address Boasts 25 BTC According to Whale Alert, the BTC wallet held 25 BTC, which was valued at $1.71 million. This wallet has been inactive since 2013 when Bitcoin’s value hovered between $100 and $266. It was an exciting and tumultuous year for Bitcoin, as its price dropped to $50 before recovering to $100. With Bitcoin’s value at less than $1,000, the wallet’s owner holds a sizable stash after the coin’s meteoric rise in the last few years. 💤 A dormant address containing 25 #BTC (1,711,020 USD) has just been activated after 10.8 years!https://t.co/jb4vDe7CLO — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) October 18, 2024 The whale’s reactivation of the wallet comes when Bitcoin’s price hit $69,000. This isn’t the first time that BTC flirted with this level. If we can remember, Bitcoin rallied to over $70,000 in July, setting up a crypto frenzy in the industry. While Bitcoin failed to sustain its $69k price, it remains solid, staying within the $68k to $69k level in the last few days. Speculators and industry watchers also expect BTC to hit the $70k level soon, backed by the increasing demand for crypto. Bitcoin traded at the $70k level on June 12th. BTC Pulls Back This week, Bitcoin failed to sustain its momentum and has slightly dipped to $68,399 after hitting a high of $68,689. According to Bloomberg, BTC investors have added over $1.8 billion this week to spot Bitcoin ETFs. Related Reading: Could Bitcoin Break $100,000? Analysts Predict 6-Figure Milestone The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gave the go-signal to BTC ETFs, which led to a frenzy of buying and inflows. Demand outpaced supply thanks to the SEC’s approval, boosting the coin’s price to over $73,797. Then, there was a pullback in early August, with the price falling by 30% before starting another rally. The expanding crypto business relies on Bitcoin and crypto whales. They own a lot of crypto, and the media follows them. The behaviors of BTC whales, which Whale Alert tracks, often cause a stir.
