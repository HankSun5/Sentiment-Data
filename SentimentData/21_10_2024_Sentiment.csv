Notably, this inflow has seen FLOKI breaking out of a descending trendline that has served as the peak of its rallies since June. This breakout is seen as a key technical development, with crypto analyst World Of Charts emphasizing it as a strong bullish signal. According to the analyst, the breakout opens the trend for the meme coin to continue the run toward a new all-time high. Related Reading: TRON Market Cap Hits Nearly $14 Billion On Strong Revenue Growth FLOKI Ready For 200% Surge Past All-Time High Although it was launched in 2021, FLOKI rose to prominence earlier this year after it went on a 1,100% increase over five months to peak at a new all-time high of $0.0003449. As it stands, the meme coin has corrected by around 55% from this all-time high. However, according to analysis and prediction from crypto analyst World Of Charts, this correction is about to end and the $0.0003449 all-time high might not hold for long anymore. World Of Charts shared his analysis on the social media platform X, posting a daily candlestick chart of the FLOKI / TetherUS trading pair. The chart reveals that the meme coin has just broken above the resistance trendline of a bullish pennant flag pattern, which the meme coin has been trading within since hitting its all-time high. In terms of the projected price trajectory, the analyst believes FLOKI is on course for another breakout that could not only exceed the previous all-time high but also push toward a price point just below $0.0005. To reach this point, FLOKI would have to go on a 210% rally from the current price level. $Floki #Floki Finally Breaking Out Send It Towards New Ath🚀 https://t.co/I2sVnrx94X pic.twitter.com/LNsAHKe1Q0 — World Of Charts (@WorldOfCharts1) October 19, 2024 Is A 200% Rally Possible For FLOKI? At the time of writing, FLOKI is trading at $0.0001554 and is still up by 12% in the past seven days. According to data from on-chain analytics platform Santiment, FLOKI and other meme coins are witnessing the highest level of interest and mentions across social media platforms in five months. This interesting trend is brought about by the new interest in Dogecoin, which has naturally flowed into other meme coins. Given this heightened attention and the bullish technical setup highlighted by analysts, a 200% rally is within the realm of possibility. FLOKI has already shown it can achieve significant gains in a short timeframe, having previously posted an impressive 1,100% increase earlier this year. If the current social buzz and market dynamics continue to favor meme coins, FLOKI could break through its resistance levels and embark on another explosive rally to deliver a 200% increase before the end of the year.

Analyst Predicts 200% Price Hike – Details,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/shiba-inu-to-double-analyst-predicts-200-price-hike-details/,"Although flying under the radar concerning price movements during Bitcoin’s recent bull run, the dog-themed cryptocurrency Shiba Inu (SHIB) was able to appreciate 8.18% in the last week while Bitcoin reclaimed the $69,000 mark on Friday. Analysts have already predicted further upward potential for this meme coin. Related Reading: Could Bitcoin Break $100,000? Analysts Predict 6-Figure Milestone Analyst Predicts 200% Surge For Shiba Inu Crypto analyst MMBTtrader seems rather positive about the future prospects of Shiba Inu as he expects a 200% increase to $0.000038. As he says, the SHIB had already registered a 75% gain from the $0.000011 support level within the price chart. The altcoin had indeed rallied from the demand zone in the early periods of August and September, accelerated its pace, and settled at $0.000019. For SHIB, MMBTtrader predicts that it will not just consolidate to $0.00003852. As a matter of fact, he expects the higher highs and higher lows pattern where the initial push to May’s highs at $0.000028 will then be corrected to September’s highs at $0.000021. In case those levels hold, the meme coin could pull to the targeted $0.00003852. Conflicting Views: Bearish Outlook From SwallowPremium MMBTtrader still remains bullish about Shiba Inu, but SwallowPremium, on the other hand, is a little more conservative. He says that the cryptocurrency would continue to go up until it hits $0.0000216, and then correct 35% down to $0.000014075. His analysis reads that the downtrend would be triggered by a correction down to $0.0000195, which may be a good time to open a short position. However, Premium also cautions that if SHIB breaks over the price of $0.0000216, a bearish outlook could be invalidated, sending the price much higher than what it has already recorded. Related Reading: TRON Market Cap Hits Nearly $14 Billion On Strong Revenue Growth Shiba Inu’s Price Path Forward Shiba Inu trades at $0.00001925, close to 11% below the level of $0.0000216 resistance. Various predictions made by market experts convey a divergence of sentiment on SHIB trajectory. MMBTtrader projection for a possible 100% increase is based on an underlying conviction for perpetuation of an upward trend. SwallowPremium sounds a note of caution with a ‘critic’ view of correcting it. Shiba Inu’s future price action depends on breaking key resistance levels and maintaining momentum. As SHIB nears crucial price points, traders will watch for breakout signs. The coming weeks will be critical in determining whether it can rise further or face another rejection.

The wallet’s re-activation comes at an exciting time when Bitcoin’s price briefly hits $69k. Dormant Bitcoin Address Boasts 25 BTC According to Whale Alert, the BTC wallet held 25 BTC, which was valued at $1.71 million. This wallet has been inactive since 2013 when Bitcoin’s value hovered between $100 and $266. It was an exciting and tumultuous year for Bitcoin, as its price dropped to $50 before recovering to $100. With Bitcoin’s value at less than $1,000, the wallet’s owner holds a sizable stash after the coin’s meteoric rise in the last few years. 💤 A dormant address containing 25 #BTC (1,711,020 USD) has just been activated after 10.8 years!https://t.co/jb4vDe7CLO — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) October 18, 2024 The whale’s reactivation of the wallet comes when Bitcoin’s price hit $69,000. This isn’t the first time that BTC flirted with this level. If we can remember, Bitcoin rallied to over $70,000 in July, setting up a crypto frenzy in the industry. While Bitcoin failed to sustain its $69k price, it remains solid, staying within the $68k to $69k level in the last few days. Speculators and industry watchers also expect BTC to hit the $70k level soon, backed by the increasing demand for crypto. Bitcoin traded at the $70k level on June 12th. BTC Pulls Back This week, Bitcoin failed to sustain its momentum and has slightly dipped to $68,399 after hitting a high of $68,689. According to Bloomberg, BTC investors have added over $1.8 billion this week to spot Bitcoin ETFs. Related Reading: Could Bitcoin Break $100,000? Analysts Predict 6-Figure Milestone The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gave the go-signal to BTC ETFs, which led to a frenzy of buying and inflows. Demand outpaced supply thanks to the SEC’s approval, boosting the coin’s price to over $73,797. Then, there was a pullback in early August, with the price falling by 30% before starting another rally. The expanding crypto business relies on Bitcoin and crypto whales. They own a lot of crypto, and the media follows them. The behaviors of BTC whales, which Whale Alert tracks, often cause a stir.

ETH could continue to rise toward $2,850 if it clears the $2,750 resistance zone. Ethereum remained in a positive zone above the $2,580 and $2,620 resistance levels. The price is trading above $2,650 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $2,680 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move up if it clears the $2,750 and $2,780 resistance levels. Ethereum Price Aims For More Gains Ethereum price remained stable above the $2,600 level like Bitcoin. ETH extended gains above the $2,650 resistance level to move further into a positive zone. The price cleared the $2,700 level and tested $2,765. A high was formed at $2,765 and the price is now consolidating gains. There was a minor decline below the $2,740 level, but the price is stable above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,576 swing low to the $2,765 high. Ethereum price is now trading above $2,650 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support near $2,680 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The trend line is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,576 swing low to the $2,765 high. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,750 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,765 level. A clear move above the $2,765 resistance might send the price toward the $2,840 resistance. An upside break above the $2,840 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,880 resistance zone in the near term. The next hurdle sits near the $2,920 level or $2,950. Another Drop In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,750 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,720 level. The first major support sits near the $2,680 zone and the trend line. A clear move below the $2,720 support might push the price toward $2,650. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,620 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,550.

This is based on historical price actions because XRP can be seen rallying within such a time frame. Though the targets appear quite ambitious, he uses previous performance as a sign for future gain and is setting up major growth opportunities for the owners of XRP. Related Reading: Could Bitcoin Break $100,000? Analysts Predict 6-Figure Milestone According to crypto expert Egrag Crypto, XRP, which is currently trading at $0.53, has experienced impressive surges of 3,300% and 700% at different times, suggesting that significant price movements could happen as we approach March 1, 2025, or even sooner in the first quarter. Crucially, these forecasts are backed by technical analysis, chart patterns, and liquidity assessments, rather than mere optimism. #XRP Bifrost Bridge ($6.4 & $27 Targets): I know 95% of the #XRPArmy is feeling exhausted from the ongoing #SEC manipulation and the appeals process, which has been overwhelming due to misleading submissions and numerous delays. 😩⚖️ But forget all of that noise! 🔇 The real… pic.twitter.com/FQ6mOe83ET — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) October 18, 2024 Technical Analysis And Market Sentiment The forecast is mostly on-chain metrics about Bifrost Bridge moving up, almost in the same direction with big stocks as that of FANGMAN. FANGMAN includes seven of the biggest tech companies or tech mega-caps of the world — Meta (Facebook), Amazon, Netflix, Alphabet (Google), Microsoft, Apple and Nvidia. FANGMAN stocks are high alpha counters, which usually depend on growth and future guidance. This comparison says that even if it’s going through tough regulations and issues with the courts, XRP might be one of the biggest long-term benefits an investor could ever have by closing out the noise and just focusing on the data. This move will have the pending case in the SEC cast as a huge boulder for the investors in XRP, with constant appeals and delays testing the patience of many investors. However, Egrag urges the XRP Army to keep moving forward with undivided attention. Instead, it’s important to focus on these cycles and levels of liquidity since they are actually capable of providing various positive insights concerning long-term price trends. With this in mind, the wise investor would be able to determine the direction XRP’s price is headed. A Resilient XRP Community The litigation to be heard against the SEC will take time, but the battle will prove to be short-term when one weighs this against the long-term potential of the cryptocurrency. What is different about the XRP community, which calls itself the XRP Army, from many other crypto communities, is its strength and resilience. Where the crypto communities often flinch before a challenge, the XRP Army holds the line in arguing for the utility value of XRP in real-world applications. These analysts believe the community is flexible, emotionally supportive, and forward-looking, making them one of the most informed groups in the cryptocurrency landscape.

Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.5880 resistance or even $0.5925 in the near term. The next major hurdle might be $0.6000. Another Drop? If XRP fails to clear the $0.5550 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.540 level. The next major support is near the $0.5380 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.5380 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $0.5320 support in the near term. The next major support sits near the $0.5250 zone.

The company's significant Bitcoin holdings and innovative debt-financed acquisition strategy have driven impressive stock performance, despite poor fundamentals. Inclusion in major indices like MSCI World and potential future inclusions could drive institutional interest and stock appreciation, enhancing MSTR's market presence. High short interest presents the possibility of a short squeeze, potentially fueling further stock gains if Bitcoin continues to perform well. Introduction MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) has attracted considerable attention recently, especially with Bitcoin USD ( BTC-USD ) up over 55% year-to-date. What sets MSTR apart is its bold, unconventional strategy, making it a unique proxy for Bitcoin’s performance. Given this unusual situation, we’ll deviate from our typical structured analysis. Instead of diving deep into industry and financial valuations, we'll focus on MSTR's distinctive approach to Bitcoin: how they acquire it, and whether this strategy can unlock further potential or expose the company to significant risks. After all, an abnormal situation necessitates abnormal actions, right? Just to be clear, we are bullish on Bitcoin , which directly influences our outlook on MSTR. As a major buyer of BTC, the company’s performance is closely tied to the asset’s performance. In this initiation, we’ll then explore Michael Saylor’s leadership and the company’s unique history, and how MSTR has evolved to become the biggest Bitcoin proxy. From there, we’ll evaluate the sustainability of their approach, identify key risks, and mention potential tailwinds that could support the stock. Captain Saylor At The Heart of The Dot Com Bubble Storm Michael Saylor is a remarkable figure in the tech industry. After graduating from MIT with dual degrees in “Aeronautics, Astronautics and Science,” “Technology, and Society” he founded MSTR at just 24 years old. Created in 1989, MSTR focuses on data exploration and management software, with Saylor serving as a CEO from its foundation until 2022 and now as the Executive Director. Often seen with a maquette of a naval ship behind him in his office, Saylor made in 1998 the pivotal decision to take the company public, raising nearly $40 million and holding 39,521 shares valued at $14,482,075, representing almost 36% ownership. Inspired by the booming tech sector, he wanted MSTR to capitalize on the public offerings trend of other software companies during the dotcom bubble. As speculation soared, MSTR's stock skyrocketed. In this period of exuberance, the company even purchased a Super Bowl ad spot in the year 2000. At its peak, Saylor briefly became the richest man in Washington, with a fortune of $7 billion. However, the tide turned dramatically when, in March 2000, the company was asked by the SEC to restate its financial statements for 1998 and 1999 due to accounting errors. This came during a time of widespread accounting scandals, such as those involving Enron and WorldCom. MSTR's stock, initially priced at $14 and soared to $333, plunged by around 91% in just two months after this scandal. First page of the Daily News Published the 21st March 2000 (Daily News) By December 2000, Saylor reached a settlement with the SEC , paying $11 million to resolve the charges. Within a matter of months, he transitioned from being one of America’s richest billionaires to a multi-millionaire. The Bitcoin Strategy - The Sun On The Horizon? On August 11, 2020, things took a massive turn for both Saylor and MSTR as the company bought for the first time 21 454 BTC for $250 million, at under $12,000 each. What could have been considered at that time as a strange anecdotal decision without consequences has turned into what Saylor calls today a “Bitcoin Strategy.” What's the logic behind it? With MSTR sitting on $500 million in cash and interest rates at rock-bottom levels during the pandemic, Saylor anticipated that this era of easy money would devalue the U.S. dollar, potentially sparking inflation. This led him to view Bitcoin’s “reserve of value” characteristics as highly compelling. Since adopting this strategy, MSTR has accumulated over 250,000 BTC, which represents 1.2% of the total Bitcoin supply. MicroStrategy Bitcoin Holdings Evolution (Bitbo) The company acquired these at an average of $39 292.18 per Bitcoin. As of today, Bitcoin trades around $68,000, representing a 73% gain on the company’s Bitcoin holdings. The impact on MSTR’s stock has been impressive, with the share price multiplying thirteenfold and outperforming Bitcoin itself by a factor of 3! Seeking Alpha Fundamentals - Is The Ship Taking on Water? We think that MSTR poor fundamentals characterized by very low top line growth is related to the firm's lack of innovation and its reliance on legacy products. Competitors in the business intelligence space have quickly embraced cloud and AI-driven technologies, while MSTR has been slower to adapt. Additionally, many of its customers still use older, on-premises software, which is less appealing as companies move to modern cloud-based solutions. This slow transition has hurt the firm competitiveness in the market. These difficulties are evident, as shown in the chart below, where revenues have declined over the past three years while the firm has been struggling to remain profitable. Seeking Alpha We don’t expect any substantial improvement in the near future as the management is now focusing only on making MSTR a “Bitcoin company,” making a transition towards BTC related activities. Despite all that, the group is performing well and continues to buy more Bitcoin. It even seems that the more it buys, the better the stock performs. How Is the Ship Not Sinking? By Raising More Debt! As noted earlier, MSTR appears to have steady revenues around $500 million. These revenues and the firm financial situation in 2019 were enough to support the firm first debt issuance. However, since 2019, the company’s long-term debt has increased from zero to $3.7 billion, all related to its Bitcoin-buying strategy. MSTR Long-Term Debt Evolution (Seeking Alpha) Here’s how it works. First, MSTR issues convertible debt. In a convertible debt agreement, a company borrows money, with the understanding that the loan will eventually be repaid by converting it into shares. Once the debt is issued, MSTR uses the proceeds to buy Bitcoin, an asset that has historically shown a long-term upward trend. As Bitcoin appreciates, the company’s intrinsic value and stock price also increase, enabling it to raise even more debt. This cycle continues, and in doing so, Saylor is making a bold move. He is indirectly betting against the U.S. dollars. Why? Because he believes the monetary system is broken that governments are issuing too much debt, and that central banks are flooding the market with liquidity, driving risky assets like Bitcoin higher while devaluating our currencies. It is hard to disagree with him when looking at this famous chart shared on Visual Capitalist . Visual Capitalist As global debt rises, economic growth slows, and central banks keep injecting liquidity, Saylor is taking advantage, and he is willing to pursue this strategy in the future. United Nations The irony? MSTR is only paying 0.625% on its latest $875 million convertible senior notes, due in 2028. The Premium Explained MSTR has been trading at a premium compared to its Bitcoin holdings. Nowadays, this premium is close to 3. It is justified in our view by several factors: First, it isn’t just a Bitcoin holding company, it has a core business in enterprise software which still generates revenues. Second, for many institutional investors, MSTR provides a convenient way to gain Bitcoin exposure on the stock market, especially for those unable to hold Bitcoin directly like many equity fund and portfolio managers. Also, unlike ETFs, which charge fees, a stock doesn’t. Finally, MSTR’s leveraged Bitcoin position enhances potential returns, making it an appealing option for those bullish on Bitcoin’s future. Will The Ship Stay Afloat For Long? We believe that as long as MSTR can borrow at low rates, it can. But there are drawbacks. The biggest one is shareholder dilution. When bondholders convert debt into shares, existing shareholders’ ownership is diluted. However, MSTR has emphasized that as Bitcoin holdings grow faster than the share count, Bitcoin per share is effectively increasing. This metric will be important to follow in the future. Company Presentation Another drawback is the company’s ability to repay its debt. With negative free cash flow, this debt may need to be rolled over with new convertible debt, further increasing leverage, or by issuing more equity, further diluting shareholders. Alternatively, MSTR could sell Bitcoin, which would directly impact both the stock price and the company’s borrowing capacity. It’s a very risky strategy, and MSTR may well be locked in a financial spiral. What If Bitcoin's Price goes down? When looking at MSTR principal debt maturities, the upcoming one will be in 2027. At that time, the company’s stock price would have to be under $143.2 (adjusted for stock split) to put the company in a difficult position. Company Presentation Tailwinds To Move The Boat Forward - Flows and Index Inclusions We believe that as the company’s market capitalization grows, it’s increasingly likely to be included in more equity indices. On May 31, 2024, MSCI, one of the leading index providers, added MSTR to the MSCI World Index , a widely used benchmark for fund managers focused on global funds. This kind of news is important, as fund managers now face the decision of whether to actively bet against the stock by not buying it, potentially risky if the stock were to skyrocket. Even those aiming to neutralize their MSTR exposure would need to buy the stock to match the benchmark exposure, creating positive buying pressure. Even though MSTR weight in this index is residual, it is in our view a first important step for further potential index inclusion and adoption. There have been rumors about MSTR potentially integrating into the S&P 500. In our view, this is unlikely, as the firm does not meet the Financial Viability criteria, which state that a company should have positive earnings in the most recent quarter and over the four most recent quarters to be considered for inclusion in the index. However, we believe that the company meets all the criteria to be potentially listed on the Nasdaq 100 ( QQQM ), which is replicated by several ETFs representing together over $500 billion in AUM. … Despite C annonballs Coming From Short Sellers After the stock's recent rally, MSTR has been heavily shorted. MarketBeat The percentage of shares shorted now represents 17.31% of the free float and is in our view weighting on the stock performance. We have the conviction that should BTC continue to perform, shorts will be in difficult position and might be forced to close their position, leaving even more upward potential for the stock. Conclusion Michael Saylor, the visionary behind MSTR’s transformation, has redefined the company's trajectory through a Bitcoin-centric strategy. For investors like us, who share the conviction that Bitcoin's long-term potential is compelling, MSTR offers a leveraged and distinctive exposure to the asset. While the important debt level poses a risk, particularly if Bitcoin were to experience a sharp decline, we believe the upside remains significant for those prepared to face the volatility. One of the key catalysts for future stock appreciation could be MSTR’s growing presence in major indices. The recent inclusion in the MSCI World Index marks just the beginning of what, we believe, will be further index recognition, driving increased institutional interest. Additionally, the current high short interest presents the possibility of a short squeeze, which could fuel further gains if the stock continues to perform well. Taking these factors into consideration, we initiate on MSTR with a BUY rating.",MSTR,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-10-21 04:49:50

DOGE is now showing positive signs and might clear the $0.1450 resistance. DOGE price started a fresh increase above the $0.1320 resistance level. The price is trading above the $0.1350 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $0.1420 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $0.1450 and $0.1465 resistance levels. Dogecoin Price Eyes More Upsides Dogecoin price started a fresh increase above the $0.1200 resistance zone. DOGE gained traction for a move above the $0.1320 resistance zone, beating Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was also a move above the $0.1350 and $0.1400 resistance levels. The price traded as high as $0.1467 and recently saw a minor downside correction. The price dipped below the $0.1420 level. It traded below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1206 swing low to the $0.1467 high. However, the bulls are active above the $0.1350 level. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $0.1420 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. Dogecoin price is now trading above the $0.1320 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.1465 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.1480 level. A close above the $0.1480 resistance might send the price toward the $0.1520 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.1550 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.1585. Are Dips Supported In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.1465 level, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.1420 level. The next major support is near the $0.1400 level. The main support sits at $0.1335 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1206 swing low to the $0.1467 high. If there is a downside break below the $0.1335 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might decline toward the $0.1250 level or even $0.1220 in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for DOGE/USD is now gaining momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for DOGE/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $0.1465 and $0.1500.

From January’s 11.5 million, the most recent statistics reveal a solid 19 million ETH now stashed in long-term holding addresses, almost doubled, data from CryptoQuant shows. With investors apparently increasing their bets, this huge surge points to a growing faith in Ethereum’s future. The crypto world is rife with conjecture since many estimate this count will reach 20 million by year’s end. Related Reading: XRP Could Skyrocket Over 4,000%, Analyst Forecasts Price Hitting $27 Clearly, there is a significant optimism in Ethereum’s long-term potential despite market swings, which leaves many wondering what is behind this increase in confidence and what this could mean for the scene of cryptocurrencies going forward. A number of factors are encouraging institutional and individual investors to increase their holdings. Notably, the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has allowed new players to enter the market. Spot ETFs Push Demand More interest from mainstream investors has come from Ethereum spot ETF approval in great part. This indicates that both individual investors and institutions are getting ready for Ethereum’s long-term future. One researcher of cryptocurrencies even thinks that by the end of 2024, the ETH in accumulating addresses will equal the market value of the biggest companies worldwide. Furthermore, assuming Ethereum prices remain around $4,000, the analyst projects that if these patterns continue, the total value of ETH held in these addresses may reach $80 billion. At $2,737 right now, ETH has increased in value by over 3% over the last 24 hours and over 10% over the last week. Staking Secures More Ethereum The other main reason why less ETH is found in the market to trade is through the increase in Ethereum staking. According to Dune Analytics, staking contracts have locked up over 34.6 million ETH that equates to nearly 30% of the entire Ethereum supply, hence showing the statistics. This led to a lack of tokens for sale and therefore played a part in taming prices. More price growth for ETH may be possible if the amount staked keeps increasing. The Ethereum market may experience less volatility and more long-term growth potential if there are less sell-side pressures. Related Reading: Could Bitcoin Break $100,000? Analysts Predict 6-Figure Milestone The Price Outlook Is Good The current price swings of Ethereum are primarily upward. ETH is currently trading above $2,700—a crucial support level—thanks to the support of its 50-day moving average. The 200-day moving average, which is $3,022, remains a barrier, though. If Ethereum is to experience consistent price growth, it will be imperative to break over that obstacle. Ethereum’s long-term supporters are undoubtedly upbeat about the platform’s future, and the accumulating tendency along with staking and spot ETFs suggest that this confidence might not be unfounded. It will be interesting to see if Ethereum can overcome significant pricing obstacles, but one thing is certain: for the time being, the long-term picture looks promising.
