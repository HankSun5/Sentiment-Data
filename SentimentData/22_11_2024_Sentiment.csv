According to a CryptoQuant analyst known as Darkfost, Ethereum‚Äôs netflow on Binance has reached a balanced state, with deposits and withdrawals stabilizing. So, what does this mean for ETH? Related Reading: Is Ethereum Undervalued? Investors Hold Firm While Price Targets Rise A Signal To Buy Or Sell? According to the analysis shared by Darkfost, this current behavior seen in Ethereum‚Äôs netflow on Binance might indicate an ‚Äúaccumulation phase,‚Äù where investors¬†refrain¬†from significant transactions as they await a ‚Äúcatalyst‚Äù to guide their next moves. The CryptoQuant analyst wrote: Ethereum‚Äôs netflow on Binance has recently turned neutral, indicating a balance between deposits and withdrawals. It could indicates that there is currently no significant buying or selling pressure. This may suggest that ETH is in an accumulation phase, with investors holding their positions and awaiting a catalyst to either buy or sell. Furthermore, Darkfost pointed out that Ethereum‚Äôs Open Interest‚Äîa measure of the total number of outstanding derivative contracts‚Äîhas steadily risen. According to the data cited by the analyst, this ETH metric is approaching an all-time high on Binance, potentially signaling increased market activity. Darkfost hinted that this could be the calm before a significant market shift. The analyst concluded by noting: As Open Interest continues to rise and approaches an all-time high on Binance, we can wonder if this is the calm before the storm ? Is Ethereum Gearing For A Major Rally After several weeks of lagging and failing to keep up the bullish pace with Bitcoin, the Ethereum price performance in the past day now signals that the asset may just be ready to fulfill the anticipated major rally many investors and enthusiasts may have been expecting. Over the past 24 hours, Ethereum has surged by 5%, with a trading price of $3,276 at the time of writing. This price increase has also unsurprisingly spiked the market cap of the second-largest crypto asset. Ethereum‚Äôs market cap valuation currently sits at $394 billion, a roughly $26 billion boost from the $368 billion valuation seen in the early hours of today.

This prediction comes after DOGE‚Äôs recent upswing in the last few weeks, suggesting a revival of its bullish momentum. Dogecoin Poised For Massive Gains In The Upcoming Weeks Amidst rising optimism in Dogecoin, Trader Tardigrade, a seasoned crypto expert and investor, has declared that the meme coin is gearing up for its next major run. Trader Tardigrade shared his prognosis on the X (formerly Twitter) platform, which has sparked excitement within the Dogecoin community. Related Reading: Analyst Confirms Dogecoin Price Test Of 0.786 Fibonacci Level, What Happens Next? The market expert claims DOGE is poised for its next bull run after citing key price patterns on its chart, particularly the Hidden Bullish Divergence formation, showing that the dog-themed meme coin is building strength for a potential breakout. A bullish hidden divergence formation typically happens within a downtrend, indicating a possible reversal or slowing of the downward momentum. Trader Tardigrade cited the key pattern in the 4-hour time frame of Dogecoin‚Äôs Relative Strength Index (RSI). According to the analyst, this crucial indicator offers early signs of a sustained upside trend in Dogecoin, allowing the digital asset to reach higher highs. As DOGE prepares for its next significant rally, Trader Tardigrade expects 2 major pumps to take place in the short term, demonstrating his robust confidence in the asset‚Äôs near-term prospects. His prognosis is based on historical price trends, whereby DOGE saw multiple rallies to its market top in the last two bull cycles. For the first pump, the expert has placed his next target at the $2 price level. Meanwhile, the second pump is set to trigger a move to the $20 threshold should history repeat itself. As a result, the analyst believes DOGE‚Äôs bull run has just started, noting it is still early to capitalize on the upswing. DOGE‚Äôs Market Top Coming Soon Than Expected? According to crypto analyst, Dima James Potts, Dogecoin‚Äôs market top appears to be much closer than widely expected. He made the claims after identifying price trends akin to previous cycle tops. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price To $1 Soon? Textbook Weekly Golden Cross Shows What‚Äôs Coming Next In the first and second cycles, DOGE witnessed a surge of 21,821% and 54,890%, respectively, from its bear market low to its peaks. Although the third cycle has not yet topped, should past events reoccur, James Potts expects DOGE to top around January 19, 2025, since the meme coin has often reached its peak in approximately 1446 days. DOGE‚Äôs market top for this cycle might be fast approaching, but the expert is confident that this cycle‚Äôs rally might be larger than the past occasions as the percentage gains in each previous cycle have risen, placing his target at $36. With indications of a resurgence in the general cryptocurrency landscape, Dogecoin might take advantage of the renewed momentum and see more increases in the upcoming days.

Our strategy that tilted into Bitcoin mining companies underperformed, leading us to consolidate back to 100% Bitcoin according to plan. Past bull runs suggest buying the breakout is more favorable than waiting for a significant pullback, as the current price offers the next best profit-risk profile. Introduction In September 2024, we published 2 events consistent with a bull run toward a new ATH. Towards the end of October 2024, the 2 events finally occurred . Within a month of the occurrence, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) rose from $70,000 to $95,000 (Fig 1), as we expected. The $90,000 resistance level (the yellow curve in Fig 1) is one of the most, if not the most, significant resistance levels for Bitcoin because it has guided the Bitcoin price over the past decade and had never been broken through. By referring to Fig 1, we can observe that this decade-old resistance level has guided all of Bitcoin's past all-time highs ('ATHs') since Bitcoin's inception. Back in 2021, it also served us well when we used it to predict the top of the 2020-2021 bull market and the sequence of events of the 2021-2022 bear market. Nevertheless, our findings suggested that the $90,000 resistance level is meant to be broken because it can only project up to a $90,000 Bitcoin. This week marks this historic moment where Bitcoin has likely broken through this decade-old resistance. Although Bitcoin is now entering uncharted territory where we can no longer rely on it to predict Bitcoin's new ATH, Bitcoin is finally free from being confined to a peak of $90,000, which now makes our $200,000 bull case price target more attainable. As Bitcoin realized our base case scenario, we'll follow up on our Bitcoin investment thesis and update our action plan in this article. Fig 1. Bitcoin's Decade-old Cycle is Broken (Author) Performance To Date Our previous article detailed our game plan to time the market and trade the Beta of Bitcoin mining companies. We first established our bullish thesis, which is that we expect Bitcoin to reach a new ATH as high as $200,000 based on the diminishing magnitude of each bull run over each halving cycle. After we waited for the 180-day wait period to lapse and for the Coppock curve to turn positive, we tilted 25% of our Bitcoin portfolio to 2 Bitcoin mining companies (CleanSpark ( CLSK ) and MARA Holdings ( MARA )) that we showed to have the best odds of beating the market. You can refer to our thesis below: MARA Holdings: A Market Mistake Where Investors Can Exploit CleanSpark Offers A Unique Proposition And Is Now Heading To Undervaluation At the time of writing, Bitcoin has fully reached our base case price target of $90,000, which is our minimum price target for Bitcoin. We also mentioned that it is within our plans to consolidate our crypto portfolio back to 100% Bitcoin once this price target is realized. If Bitcoin reaches $90,000 as we expect, we'll consolidate the portfolio back to 100% Bitcoin by selling all Bitcoin mining companies. This aligns with our stance to be conservative. So we've proceeded to liquidate our CLSK and MARA positions back into spot Bitcoin. The reason for this early consolidation is because MARA and CLSK may still be among the top 3 best-performing Bitcoin mining companies among the major Bitcoin miners (beaten only by Hut 8 ( HUT )), none outperformed Bitcoin as we hoped. We think that this could be a sign that the market no longer perceives Bitcoin mining companies as a levered Bitcoin play and is increasingly aware of their systematic and unsystematic downside risk . This implies that Bitcoin mining companies might now have a lower Beta to Bitcoin on the upside but a higher Beta on the downside. In other words, Bitcoin mining companies might appreciate less than Bitcoin in a Bitcoin bull run but decline more than Bitcoin in a Bitcoin bear market. Fig 2. Performance of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Mining Companies (YCharts) The Updated Thesis Now that Bitcoin has broken through the historic $90,000 resistance level, the most likely dilemma for investors and traders is whether to wait for a pullback (retest). The consensus to identify a support resistance ('SR') level is that the price has to bounce off a specific level at least twice. Once broken, a resistance will turn to support, and vice versa. Then, the common breakout trading strategy is to wait for a retest on the resistance-turned-support or the support-turned-resistance level to avoid a fakeout. While it may be a valid strategy, the retest might not come. The dilemma would be whether to enter at a less optimal price with a less attractive profit-loss ratio, or risk completely losing out on the opportunity. Whether to buy on a breakout or a retest depends on the trader's expectation of Bitcoin's probable price action. Our findings suggest buying on this breakout now is better than waiting for a retest. Firstly, we are still early in the Bitcoin bull market. Past halving cycles suggest that the minimum Bitcoin bull market spans one year and can extend for another six months starting from the halving event. This implies that the Bitcoin bull run is expected to last at least until April 2025 and up to October 2025. This is why we expected Bitcoin to hit our $100,000 base case price target with minimal headwinds before April 2025 . With 5 to 11 months left in this bull cycle, it is increasingly likely that Bitcoin will reach our bull case price target of $200,000. If one intends to wait for a retest, the 2 potential levels for retest are the $90,000 price level and the $73,000 price level (Fig 3) Therefore, it should be fine whether Bitcoin retests or not. Secondly, if Bitcoin were to pull back and retest significant support levels, it would unlikely reach the $73,000 support level (marked in yellow) based on the two past bull runs. Fig 3. 2 Major Support Level Marked in Yellow Horizontal Line (Author) (Author) As we've explained in our previous thesis, the first 6 months of a Bitcoin bull market involve reclaiming the existing ATH (Phase 1), while the subsequent 6 to 12 months involve reaching for new ATHs (Phase 2). Looking closer, the price coming out of Phase 1 usually marks the lowest price for Phase 2. Coming out of Phase 1 in the 2016-2020 cycle, Bitcoin continued its weekly pullback down to the nearest (and significant) $740 support level and has never retested that level again in Phase 2 (Fig 4). Fig 4. Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the Bull Market in the 2016-2020 Cycle (Author) (Author) Coming out of Phase 2 in the 2020-2024 cycle, Bitcoin exited Phase 1 at $16,000 and continued to break the 2016-2020 cycle ATH ($20,000) without any significant pullback back into Phase 1 price levels (Fig 5). Fig 5. Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the Bull Market in the 2020-2024 Cycle (Author) (Author) These observations suggest that it is unlikely for Bitcoin to revisit the $73,000 price level, even though it is a significant support level. It is more likely for Bitcoin to retest the $90,000 price level. However, a retest to the $90,000 support level now only represents a 3.6% drawdown, which is insignificant considering the potential bull case upside is a 120% return (if Bitcoin reaches $200,000 from the current $93,000 price). Conclusion Although our attempt to replicate our success via Bitcoin mining companies didn't yield the desired result, we are excited to see our base case scenario for Bitcoin realizing this early in the second phase of the 2024-2028 Halving Cycle. While we're still experimenting with magnifying Bitcoin returns via Bitcoin options contract (just like our past trade on BITO ), more work is required before we're comfortable with the added risk. In this article, our findings suggest that buying the breakout is more favorable than waiting for a significant pullback. Firstly, it is unlikely that Bitcoin will revisit the $73,000 support level while it remains close to the historic $90,000 support level. Secondly, Bitcoin is likely still in the early stages of a bull market, with more upside potential lasting anywhere from 5 to 11 months. If you've missed our previous entry to enter below $70,000, this might be the next best entry price before Bitcoin reaches new ATHs",CLSK|MARA|BTC-USD,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|MINING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-11-22 02:23:19

The pair could continue to rise if it clears the $100,000 resistance zone. Bitcoin Price Sets Another ATH Bitcoin price remained supported above the $92,000 level. BTC formed a base and started a fresh increase above the $95,000 level. It cleared the $96,500 level and traded to a new high at $98,999 before there was a pullback. There was a move below the $98,000 level. However, the price remained stable above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $91,500 swing low to the $98,990 high. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $95,200 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The trend line is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $91,500 swing low to the $98,990 high. Bitcoin price is now trading above $96,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $98,880 level. The first key resistance is near the $99,000 level. A clear move above the $99,000 resistance might send the price higher. The next key resistance could be $100,000. A close above the $100,000 resistance might initiate more gains. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $102,000 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $104,500 resistance level. Downside Correction In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $100,000 resistance zone, it could start a downside correction. Immediate support on the downside is near the $98,000 level. The first major support is near the $96,800 level. The next support is now near the $95,500 zone and the trend line. Any more losses might send the price toward the $92,000 support in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD ‚Äì The MACD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) ‚Äì The RSI for BTC/USD is now above the 50 level.

DOGE is holding gains and eyeing more upsides above $0.400. DOGE price started a fresh increase above the $0.3750 resistance level. The price is trading above the $0.3800 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a short-term contracting triangle with resistance at $0.390 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could continue to rally if it clears the $0.400 and $0.4080 resistance levels. Dogecoin Price Eyes More Upsides Dogecoin price remained supported above the $0.350 level and recently started a fresh increase like Bitcoin and Ethereum. DOGE was able to clear the $0.3650 and $0.3750 resistance levels. The price climbed above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.4208 swing high to the $0.3652 low. Besides, there was a break above a short-term contracting triangle with resistance at $0.390 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. Dogecoin price is now trading above the $0.3750 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.3950 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.4208 swing high to the $0.3652 low. The first major resistance for the bulls could be near the $0.400 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.4080 level. A close above the $0.4080 resistance might send the price toward the $0.4200 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.4500 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.500. Are Dips Supported In DOGE? If DOGE‚Äôs price fails to climb above the $0.400 level, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.3850 level. The next major support is near the $0.3750 level. The main support sits at $0.3550. If there is a downside break below the $0.3550 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might decline toward the $0.3200 level or even $0.300 in the near term.

The derivatives market surge, while driving prices higher, also increases volatility and the risk of liquidations. ETF inflows have approached $2 billion in three days, further boosting Bitcoin‚Äôs rally. By Zain Vawda Bitcoin prices continue to rise and print fresh highs as speculation continues to grow around a favorable outlook toward crypto from the incoming Trump administration. To further support these rumors, leaks about a potential White House crypto expert appointment and rumors of Trumps social media companies interest in a buyout of crypto trading firm Bakkt has aided the rally. The Crypto Fear and Greed index shows markets are in a period of extreme greed. Source: FinancialJuice The question is whether this will lead to pullback, or are we set for more gains in the coming weeks? Bitcoin‚Äôs Impressive Climb Amid Derivative Market Surge One big reason Bitcoin‚Äôs price has gone up is because institutional demand continues to rise. They‚Äôre putting a lot of money into Bitcoin, which makes it more trustworthy. For example, MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) has bought a lot of Bitcoin and made a good profit as its value has increased. The way the market works also helps. More people are accepting Bitcoin as a real type of investment. Since there‚Äôs only a limited amount of Bitcoin available and more people want it, the price keeps going up on the basic rule of supply and demand. The derivatives market is a big factor in Bitcoin‚Äôs price increase. Bitcoin‚Äôs Open Interest, which shows how many contracts are active, has reached $63 billion. This is a record amount and is much higher than in 2021, when it was over $20 billion. Back then, Bitcoin‚Äôs price was at its highest, around $69,000. Source: CoinGlass The derivatives market surge does pose risks, however, with volatility expected to be higher and price swings a more common occurrence. This is simply down to leverage, with wild price swings likely to lead to an increase in liquidations. Over the past 24 hours, liquidations have totaled $450 million, with around 60% of this coming from short positions. The old adage rings true for Bitcoin as well, ""the trend is indeed your friend"". ETF Flows Surge Approaches $2 Billion in Three Days ETF flows have only increased over the past few days, with a total nearing $2 billion over the period November 18-20. Since November 1, Bitcoin ETFs have only experienced 5 days of outflows with 9 days of inflows. The rise in ETF adoption is likely to continue now given the hype around the Trump Presidency and his perceived pro crypto stance. If the ETF flows continue to grow, it is likely that we have not seen the last of the current Bitcoin rally. Source: CoinGlass Technical Analysis BTC/USD Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is on a tear this week in particular, having traded just below $90k handle on Monday. Since then, we have had 3 consecutive days of gains boosted by a combination of factors. The difficult part about the technical outlook is that there is no historical price action to base any analysis off. As we discussed earlier in the article, there is the risk of swings due to the surge in the derivatives market. Looking at the RSI, it has been in overbought territory since Bitcoin has breached $75k. Another sign that despite the RSI being in overbought territory, there is no guarantee that a pullback will materialize. For now, immediate support is at 95000, with a break lower eyeing a move toward 91804 and then the 90000 psychological level. Looking at a move to the upside and the 100000 mark could lead to some wild price swings, as market participants may eye some profit-taking as well. Beyond this at the moment, I will be keeping an eye on the round numbers/psychological numbers around 105000 and 110000.

This breakout has ignited fresh waves of bullish optimism across the crypto market, as traders and investors anticipate greater gains. With market sentiment shifting and key indicators aligning, could this be the spark for Bitcoin‚Äôs next major rally? As optimism steadily increases in the market, the goal is to take a closer look at BTC‚Äôs impressive breakout above the $93,257 mark, analyze the positive sentiment driving its climb, and assess the potential for continued upward strength in the market. Bullish Indicators: What‚Äôs Fueling BTC‚Äôs Uptrend? Currently, on the 4-hour chart, BTC is sustaining its position after successfully surpassing the $93,257 mark while trading above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). By maintaining its position above this level and the 100-day SMA, BTC demonstrates resilience and capability for more price growth, targeting new highs. An analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows a significant surge, climbing to 70% from its previous low of 56%, indicating strong bullish pressure for BTC. While this increase signals growing positive market sentiment, it raises concerns about the rally‚Äôs sustainability since a price correction could occur if profit-taking ensues. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Forms Bullish Symmetrical Triangle, Crypto Analyst Says Next Stop Is $100,000 Bitcoin is showing strong positive movement after breaking past the $93,257 level, supported by a rise above the 100-day SMA, reflecting sustained bullish strength and potential for continued upward movement. The fact that BTC is consistently above the 100-day SMA suggests a solid trend and that the bulls are eager to push prices higher, possibly leading to an extended growth if pressure continues to build. Finally, the RSI on the daily chart is currently at 81%, well above the key 50% threshold, signaling a strong uptrend for Bitcoin. With the RSI at this level, it suggests that the upside pressure is likely to continue, which means that Bitcoin‚Äôs price could keep rising in the near term, as there are no signs of a reversal or decline. What The $93,257 Breakout Signals For Bitcoin The $93,257 breakout opens the door to a more optimistic future outlook for Bitcoin. This key resistance level has been decisively breached, suggesting that BTC may continue its upbeat momentum, potentially targeting higher price levels such as the $100,000 mark and beyond. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price on the Rise: Is There More Fuel for the Rally? However, careful monitoring is essential for any signs of resistance or market corrections that could hinder its ascent. Should such a scenario occur, Bitcoin‚Äôs price could begin to drop toward the $93,257 mark. A break below this level might trigger further declines, possibly testing additional support levels in the process.

Shiba Inu Is Currently Trying To Break Past The $0.000025 Resistance In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed a pattern that has been forming in the SHIB price recently. Below is the chart shared by the analyst that depicts the technical analysis (TA) pattern in question. As is visible in the graph, Shiba Inu has been consolidating inside a bull pennant recently. A pennant is a pattern that consists of three parts: a pole, a triangular consolidation channel, and the succeeding breakout. The ‚Äòpole‚Äô is made up of an initial sharp uptrend or downtrend in the coin‚Äôs price. In the context of the current topic, a bull pennant is of relevance, so the pole corresponds to the former type of trend. Related Reading: XRP Binance Inflows Spike: What It Means For Price The consolidation channel that succeeds the pole (the region that‚Äôs actually the ‚Äòpennant‚Äô) has the asset move back and forth between two converging trendlines. The upper level of the channel generally provides resistance, while the lower one supports. A break out of either of these lines can imply a continuation of trend in that direction. The likelihood of a breakout taking place naturally goes up the closer the asset gets to the apex of the pattern. From the chart, it‚Äôs apparent that Shiba Inu has been closing in on the converging point of this bull pennant recently, implying that a break could take place soon. In the scenario that this breakout happens towards the upside, it‚Äôs possible that the resulting uptrend would last for a similar length as the pole. If so, SHIB would rise to the $0.000037 mark. Such a rally would imply an increase of more than 53% from the current price of the meme coin. However, Shiba Inu must clear one major obstacle for the run to occur: the $0.000025 level. Not only does this level roughly coincide with the upper line of the pennant, it also hosts a major on-chain demand zone. As Martinez has pointed out in another X post, around 40,000 addresses purchased a total of 54.6 trillion tokens of the asset around an average price of $0.000025. Investors who bought their coins around this level would naturally be holding them at a loss right now. As such, it‚Äôs possible that when the SHIB price retests this level, some of these holders will decide to sell, fearing that their holdings will dip into loss again in the future.

What‚Äôs Causing Ethereum‚Äôs Underperformance Against Bitcoin? Bitcoin‚Äôs new ATH earlier today brings it within $2,000 of the coveted $100,000 mark. However, BTC‚Äôs sustained dominance has resulted in the underperformance of altcoins, particularly Ethereum, throughout the year. Related Reading: Ethereum Could Be Set To Explore New Highs As On-Chain Metrics Light Up The weekly chart below reveals that the ETH/BTC trading pair has dropped to a multi-year low of 0.0331 ‚Äì a level last seen in March 2021. Since December 2021, the pair has failed to form a new higher high, reflecting a decline of over 60%. The pair‚Äôs losses have accelerated since July 2024, coinciding with Bitcoin‚Äôs price surge, driven by rising optimism over pro-crypto Republican candidate Donald Trump‚Äôs prospects in the U.S. presidential election. The success of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has also contributed to institutional preference for BTC over other cryptocurrencies. At present, BTC ETFs hold more than $100 billion in total net assets. While Ethereum ETFs have also received regulatory approval, they haven‚Äôt matched the success of their Bitcoin counterparts. For instance, US-based spot Ethereum ETFs have accumulated only $8.96 billion in total net assets so far. Additional factors, such as Bitcoin‚Äôs halving in April 2024 ‚Äì reducing miner rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC‚Äîhave further reinforced BTC‚Äôs supply scarcity narrative. In contrast, Ethereum‚Äôs rising issuance rate has led some experts to question its ‚Äúultrasound money‚Äù status. Additional factors such as Bitcoin halving in April ‚Äì which slashed miner rewards from 6.250 BTC to 3.125 BTC ‚Äì further reinforced the digital asset‚Äôs supply scarcity narrative. In contrast, Ethereum‚Äôs rising issuance rate has led some experts to question its ‚Äúultrasound money‚Äù status. When Will Ethereum Recover Losses Relative To BTC? With the ETH/BTC trading pair hitting new lows, Ethereum traders are eager to know when ETH might recover its losses. Several analysts have shared their views on X. Related Reading: Last Chance To Buy Ethereum? Analyst Expects $6,000 Once It Breaks 8-Month Accumulation Crypto analyst @CryptoGemRnld recently identified two strong support zones: a trendline support and a demand box zone. According to the analyst, since 2017, the ETH/BTC pair has historically rebounded from these levels, often leading to altcoin seasons. Similarly, seasoned trader Peter Brandt has suggested that the ETH/BTC ratio may be approaching its bottom. Brandt‚Äôs analysis predicts a potential reversal in December, with the trading pair beginning an upward trajectory. Supporting this outlook, recent data indicates that ETH may be undervalued at current prices. The limited inflow of ETH to exchanges, coupled with a lack of significant profit-taking, suggests that ETH bulls are holding out for further gains. Additionally, spot ETH ETFs have been recording significant inflows, attracting over $515 million between November 9 and November 15. At press time, ETH trades at $3,333, up 7.4% in the past 24 hours.
