According to a CryptoQuant analyst known as Darkfost, Ethereum‚Äôs netflow on Binance has reached a balanced state, with deposits and withdrawals stabilizing. So, what does this mean for ETH? Related Reading: Is Ethereum Undervalued? Investors Hold Firm While Price Targets Rise A Signal To Buy Or Sell? According to the analysis shared by Darkfost, this current behavior seen in Ethereum‚Äôs netflow on Binance might indicate an ‚Äúaccumulation phase,‚Äù where investors¬†refrain¬†from significant transactions as they await a ‚Äúcatalyst‚Äù to guide their next moves. The CryptoQuant analyst wrote: Ethereum‚Äôs netflow on Binance has recently turned neutral, indicating a balance between deposits and withdrawals. It could indicates that there is currently no significant buying or selling pressure. This may suggest that ETH is in an accumulation phase, with investors holding their positions and awaiting a catalyst to either buy or sell. Furthermore, Darkfost pointed out that Ethereum‚Äôs Open Interest‚Äîa measure of the total number of outstanding derivative contracts‚Äîhas steadily risen. According to the data cited by the analyst, this ETH metric is approaching an all-time high on Binance, potentially signaling increased market activity. Darkfost hinted that this could be the calm before a significant market shift. The analyst concluded by noting: As Open Interest continues to rise and approaches an all-time high on Binance, we can wonder if this is the calm before the storm ? Is Ethereum Gearing For A Major Rally After several weeks of lagging and failing to keep up the bullish pace with Bitcoin, the Ethereum price performance in the past day now signals that the asset may just be ready to fulfill the anticipated major rally many investors and enthusiasts may have been expecting. Over the past 24 hours, Ethereum has surged by 5%, with a trading price of $3,276 at the time of writing. This price increase has also unsurprisingly spiked the market cap of the second-largest crypto asset. Ethereum‚Äôs market cap valuation currently sits at $394 billion, a roughly $26 billion boost from the $368 billion valuation seen in the early hours of today.

This prediction comes after DOGE‚Äôs recent upswing in the last few weeks, suggesting a revival of its bullish momentum. Dogecoin Poised For Massive Gains In The Upcoming Weeks Amidst rising optimism in Dogecoin, Trader Tardigrade, a seasoned crypto expert and investor, has declared that the meme coin is gearing up for its next major run. Trader Tardigrade shared his prognosis on the X (formerly Twitter) platform, which has sparked excitement within the Dogecoin community. Related Reading: Analyst Confirms Dogecoin Price Test Of 0.786 Fibonacci Level, What Happens Next? The market expert claims DOGE is poised for its next bull run after citing key price patterns on its chart, particularly the Hidden Bullish Divergence formation, showing that the dog-themed meme coin is building strength for a potential breakout. A bullish hidden divergence formation typically happens within a downtrend, indicating a possible reversal or slowing of the downward momentum. Trader Tardigrade cited the key pattern in the 4-hour time frame of Dogecoin‚Äôs Relative Strength Index (RSI). According to the analyst, this crucial indicator offers early signs of a sustained upside trend in Dogecoin, allowing the digital asset to reach higher highs. As DOGE prepares for its next significant rally, Trader Tardigrade expects 2 major pumps to take place in the short term, demonstrating his robust confidence in the asset‚Äôs near-term prospects. His prognosis is based on historical price trends, whereby DOGE saw multiple rallies to its market top in the last two bull cycles. For the first pump, the expert has placed his next target at the $2 price level. Meanwhile, the second pump is set to trigger a move to the $20 threshold should history repeat itself. As a result, the analyst believes DOGE‚Äôs bull run has just started, noting it is still early to capitalize on the upswing. DOGE‚Äôs Market Top Coming Soon Than Expected? According to crypto analyst, Dima James Potts, Dogecoin‚Äôs market top appears to be much closer than widely expected. He made the claims after identifying price trends akin to previous cycle tops. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price To $1 Soon? Textbook Weekly Golden Cross Shows What‚Äôs Coming Next In the first and second cycles, DOGE witnessed a surge of 21,821% and 54,890%, respectively, from its bear market low to its peaks. Although the third cycle has not yet topped, should past events reoccur, James Potts expects DOGE to top around January 19, 2025, since the meme coin has often reached its peak in approximately 1446 days. DOGE‚Äôs market top for this cycle might be fast approaching, but the expert is confident that this cycle‚Äôs rally might be larger than the past occasions as the percentage gains in each previous cycle have risen, placing his target at $36. With indications of a resurgence in the general cryptocurrency landscape, Dogecoin might take advantage of the renewed momentum and see more increases in the upcoming days.

Our strategy that tilted into Bitcoin mining companies underperformed, leading us to consolidate back to 100% Bitcoin according to plan. Past bull runs suggest buying the breakout is more favorable than waiting for a significant pullback, as the current price offers the next best profit-risk profile. Introduction In September 2024, we published 2 events consistent with a bull run toward a new ATH. Towards the end of October 2024, the 2 events finally occurred . Within a month of the occurrence, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) rose from $70,000 to $95,000 (Fig 1), as we expected. The $90,000 resistance level (the yellow curve in Fig 1) is one of the most, if not the most, significant resistance levels for Bitcoin because it has guided the Bitcoin price over the past decade and had never been broken through. By referring to Fig 1, we can observe that this decade-old resistance level has guided all of Bitcoin's past all-time highs ('ATHs') since Bitcoin's inception. Back in 2021, it also served us well when we used it to predict the top of the 2020-2021 bull market and the sequence of events of the 2021-2022 bear market. Nevertheless, our findings suggested that the $90,000 resistance level is meant to be broken because it can only project up to a $90,000 Bitcoin. This week marks this historic moment where Bitcoin has likely broken through this decade-old resistance. Although Bitcoin is now entering uncharted territory where we can no longer rely on it to predict Bitcoin's new ATH, Bitcoin is finally free from being confined to a peak of $90,000, which now makes our $200,000 bull case price target more attainable. As Bitcoin realized our base case scenario, we'll follow up on our Bitcoin investment thesis and update our action plan in this article. Fig 1. Bitcoin's Decade-old Cycle is Broken (Author) Performance To Date Our previous article detailed our game plan to time the market and trade the Beta of Bitcoin mining companies. We first established our bullish thesis, which is that we expect Bitcoin to reach a new ATH as high as $200,000 based on the diminishing magnitude of each bull run over each halving cycle. After we waited for the 180-day wait period to lapse and for the Coppock curve to turn positive, we tilted 25% of our Bitcoin portfolio to 2 Bitcoin mining companies (CleanSpark ( CLSK ) and MARA Holdings ( MARA )) that we showed to have the best odds of beating the market. You can refer to our thesis below: MARA Holdings: A Market Mistake Where Investors Can Exploit CleanSpark Offers A Unique Proposition And Is Now Heading To Undervaluation At the time of writing, Bitcoin has fully reached our base case price target of $90,000, which is our minimum price target for Bitcoin. We also mentioned that it is within our plans to consolidate our crypto portfolio back to 100% Bitcoin once this price target is realized. If Bitcoin reaches $90,000 as we expect, we'll consolidate the portfolio back to 100% Bitcoin by selling all Bitcoin mining companies. This aligns with our stance to be conservative. So we've proceeded to liquidate our CLSK and MARA positions back into spot Bitcoin. The reason for this early consolidation is because MARA and CLSK may still be among the top 3 best-performing Bitcoin mining companies among the major Bitcoin miners (beaten only by Hut 8 ( HUT )), none outperformed Bitcoin as we hoped. We think that this could be a sign that the market no longer perceives Bitcoin mining companies as a levered Bitcoin play and is increasingly aware of their systematic and unsystematic downside risk . This implies that Bitcoin mining companies might now have a lower Beta to Bitcoin on the upside but a higher Beta on the downside. In other words, Bitcoin mining companies might appreciate less than Bitcoin in a Bitcoin bull run but decline more than Bitcoin in a Bitcoin bear market. Fig 2. Performance of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Mining Companies (YCharts) The Updated Thesis Now that Bitcoin has broken through the historic $90,000 resistance level, the most likely dilemma for investors and traders is whether to wait for a pullback (retest). The consensus to identify a support resistance ('SR') level is that the price has to bounce off a specific level at least twice. Once broken, a resistance will turn to support, and vice versa. Then, the common breakout trading strategy is to wait for a retest on the resistance-turned-support or the support-turned-resistance level to avoid a fakeout. While it may be a valid strategy, the retest might not come. The dilemma would be whether to enter at a less optimal price with a less attractive profit-loss ratio, or risk completely losing out on the opportunity. Whether to buy on a breakout or a retest depends on the trader's expectation of Bitcoin's probable price action. Our findings suggest buying on this breakout now is better than waiting for a retest. Firstly, we are still early in the Bitcoin bull market. Past halving cycles suggest that the minimum Bitcoin bull market spans one year and can extend for another six months starting from the halving event. This implies that the Bitcoin bull run is expected to last at least until April 2025 and up to October 2025. This is why we expected Bitcoin to hit our $100,000 base case price target with minimal headwinds before April 2025 . With 5 to 11 months left in this bull cycle, it is increasingly likely that Bitcoin will reach our bull case price target of $200,000. If one intends to wait for a retest, the 2 potential levels for retest are the $90,000 price level and the $73,000 price level (Fig 3) Therefore, it should be fine whether Bitcoin retests or not. Secondly, if Bitcoin were to pull back and retest significant support levels, it would unlikely reach the $73,000 support level (marked in yellow) based on the two past bull runs. Fig 3. 2 Major Support Level Marked in Yellow Horizontal Line (Author) (Author) As we've explained in our previous thesis, the first 6 months of a Bitcoin bull market involve reclaiming the existing ATH (Phase 1), while the subsequent 6 to 12 months involve reaching for new ATHs (Phase 2). Looking closer, the price coming out of Phase 1 usually marks the lowest price for Phase 2. Coming out of Phase 1 in the 2016-2020 cycle, Bitcoin continued its weekly pullback down to the nearest (and significant) $740 support level and has never retested that level again in Phase 2 (Fig 4). Fig 4. Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the Bull Market in the 2016-2020 Cycle (Author) (Author) Coming out of Phase 2 in the 2020-2024 cycle, Bitcoin exited Phase 1 at $16,000 and continued to break the 2016-2020 cycle ATH ($20,000) without any significant pullback back into Phase 1 price levels (Fig 5). Fig 5. Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the Bull Market in the 2020-2024 Cycle (Author) (Author) These observations suggest that it is unlikely for Bitcoin to revisit the $73,000 price level, even though it is a significant support level. It is more likely for Bitcoin to retest the $90,000 price level. However, a retest to the $90,000 support level now only represents a 3.6% drawdown, which is insignificant considering the potential bull case upside is a 120% return (if Bitcoin reaches $200,000 from the current $93,000 price). Conclusion Although our attempt to replicate our success via Bitcoin mining companies didn't yield the desired result, we are excited to see our base case scenario for Bitcoin realizing this early in the second phase of the 2024-2028 Halving Cycle. While we're still experimenting with magnifying Bitcoin returns via Bitcoin options contract (just like our past trade on BITO ), more work is required before we're comfortable with the added risk. In this article, our findings suggest that buying the breakout is more favorable than waiting for a significant pullback. Firstly, it is unlikely that Bitcoin will revisit the $73,000 support level while it remains close to the historic $90,000 support level. Secondly, Bitcoin is likely still in the early stages of a bull market, with more upside potential lasting anywhere from 5 to 11 months. If you've missed our previous entry to enter below $70,000, this might be the next best entry price before Bitcoin reaches new ATHs",CLSK|MARA|BTC-USD,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|MINING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-11-22 02:23:19
