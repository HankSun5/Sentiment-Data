41448978,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=138856,1741644726,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Whale’s Strategic Rescue: Crypto Giant Averts Massive MakerDAO Liquidation with 2K ETH Deposit,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/whale-makerdao-liquidation-eth/,"In the fast-paced world of decentralized finance (DeFi), where fortunes can swing wildly in the blink of an eye, a recent on-chain event has captured the attention of crypto enthusiasts and market analysts alike. An anonymous crypto whale, facing a looming liquidation of a substantial 65,675 ETH on MakerDAO, executed a strategic rescue maneuver by depositing 2,000 ETH. This decisive action, worth millions, successfully restored the health ratio of their position and averted a potential market cascade. Let’s dive into the details of this fascinating event and understand its implications for the broader DeFi ecosystem. What Exactly Happened with the Crypto Whale and MakerDAO? Imagine navigating the turbulent waters of the crypto market, and suddenly, you find your vessel – in this case, a significant DeFi position – on the brink of capsizing. This was the situation faced by a crypto whale on MakerDAO , a leading decentralized lending platform. According to on-chain data, this particular whale was staring down the barrel of a potential liquidation of 65,675 ETH. To put that into perspective, at the time of the event, this amount was valued at a staggering $135.8 million. A liquidation of this magnitude could have sent ripples across the market, potentially triggering further liquidations and price volatility. Here’s a breakdown of the critical moments: The Threat: The whale’s position on MakerDAO was nearing the critical liquidation threshold. This meant that if the price of ETH, their collateral, were to fall further, MakerDAO’s smart contracts would automatically sell off their collateral to cover their debt. The Alert: On-chain monitoring tools, like those used by blockchain analytics firms, likely flagged this position as high-risk, triggering alerts within the crypto community. The Response: In a swift and calculated move, the whale withdrew 2,000 ETH from the Bitfinex exchange. The Rescue: Within just 20 minutes of the withdrawal, this 2,000 ETH was deposited directly into their MakerDAO vault. The Outcome: This injection of additional collateral successfully boosted the health ratio of their position to 1.07, effectively pulling it back from the brink of liquidation. [img src=”image-of-whale-depositing-eth-makerdao.jpg” alt=”Whale Deposits ETH to MakerDAO”] Why is Avoiding Liquidation So Crucial in DeFi? Liquidation events are an inherent mechanism in DeFi lending platforms like MakerDAO, designed to ensure the solvency of the system. However, they can also be incredibly painful for individual users and have broader market implications. Let’s understand why avoiding liquidation is paramount: For the Individual User: Liquidation means losing a significant portion of your collateral. When a position is liquidated, it’s not sold off at the optimal market price but rather at a discount to ensure a quick sale and cover the debt. This can result in substantial financial losses for the position holder. Systemic Risk: Large liquidations, especially of the magnitude faced by this whale, can introduce systemic risk into the DeFi ecosystem. A cascade of liquidations can lead to a rapid downward spiral in asset prices, impacting the entire market and potentially causing instability. Market Sentiment: Significant liquidation events can negatively impact market sentiment. They can create fear and uncertainty, leading to further sell-offs and hindering the overall growth and adoption of DeFi. MakerDAO and the Mechanics of Liquidation To fully appreciate the whale’s strategic rescue , it’s essential to understand how MakerDAO and its liquidation mechanism work. MakerDAO is a decentralized autonomous organization that issues DAI, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. Users can lock up collateral, such as ETH, in MakerDAO vaults to borrow DAI. The amount of DAI they can borrow is determined by the collateralization ratio, which is the value of the collateral relative to the borrowed DAI. This ratio is crucial for maintaining the health of the position. Here’s a simplified breakdown: Term Description Vault A smart contract where users deposit collateral and borrow DAI. Collateral Assets like ETH locked in the vault to secure the borrowed DAI. DAI The stablecoin borrowed against the collateral. Collateralization Ratio The ratio of collateral value to borrowed DAI value. A higher ratio indicates a healthier position. Liquidation Threshold A minimum collateralization ratio. If the ratio falls below this threshold, the vault is at risk of liquidation. Health Ratio A measure of the safety of a vault. A health ratio above 1 indicates the position is safe from immediate liquidation. When the value of the collateral (ETH in this case) decreases, or the value of DAI increases, the collateralization ratio falls. If it drops below the liquidation threshold, the MakerDAO protocol initiates liquidation. This is where the whale found themselves, and their prompt 2,000 ETH deposit was the antidote. The Significance of Whale Activity in the Crypto Market The actions of crypto whales, individuals or entities holding substantial amounts of cryptocurrency, often have a significant impact on the market. Their trades can trigger price movements, influence market sentiment, and sometimes even cause mini-crashes or rallies. This particular whale’s near-liquidation and subsequent rescue highlights several key aspects: Market Volatility: It underscores the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market, especially for assets like ETH. Even large holders are not immune to market fluctuations and the risks of liquidation. Importance of Risk Management: This event serves as a stark reminder of the critical importance of risk management in DeFi. Even sophisticated participants like whales need to actively monitor their positions and have strategies in place to mitigate risks. DeFi Infrastructure Resilience: The fact that the whale could successfully avert liquidation by depositing more collateral demonstrates the robustness of DeFi infrastructure. The transparent and permissionless nature of DeFi allows for quick and effective responses to market challenges. On-chain Transparency: The entire event, from the initial risk to the final rescue, was visible on the blockchain. This transparency is a hallmark of DeFi and allows for greater accountability and market understanding. Actionable Insights: Lessons from the Whale’s DeFi Maneuver What can we, as participants in the crypto space, learn from this whale’s experience? Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Your DeFi Positions Diligently: Whether you’re a whale or a smaller participant, regularly monitor the health ratios of your DeFi positions. Set up alerts for critical thresholds to avoid surprise liquidations. Understand Liquidation Risks: Before engaging in DeFi lending or borrowing, thoroughly understand the liquidation mechanisms of the platforms you use. Know the liquidation thresholds and how they are calculated. Diversify Your Collateral: Consider diversifying your collateral across different assets to reduce the risk associated with the price volatility of a single asset. Keep Dry Powder Ready: Maintain readily available funds (like stablecoins or easily accessible ETH) to quickly add collateral to your positions when needed, just as this whale did. Utilize Risk Management Tools: Explore and utilize DeFi risk management tools and dashboards that provide real-time monitoring and alerts for your positions across various platforms. The Future of DeFi and Risk Mitigation The DeFi space is constantly evolving, with new protocols, risk management tools, and strategies emerging regularly. Events like this whale’s near-liquidation experience contribute to the collective learning and refinement of the DeFi ecosystem. As DeFi matures, we can expect to see: More Sophisticated Risk Management Tools: Development of more advanced and user-friendly risk management tools will become crucial for wider DeFi adoption. Improved Liquidation Mechanisms: Protocols may explore more nuanced and less disruptive liquidation mechanisms to minimize market shocks. Increased User Education: Greater emphasis on user education about DeFi risks and best practices will empower participants to navigate the space more safely and effectively. Institutional Adoption: As institutions increasingly enter the DeFi space, their sophisticated risk management frameworks and resources could contribute to greater market stability. Conclusion: A Whale’s Wisdom in DeFi Waters The story of the crypto whale who averted a massive liquidation on MakerDAO is more than just a tale of high-stakes finance. It’s a compelling illustration of the risks and opportunities inherent in DeFi, the importance of strategic decision-making, and the ever-present need for vigilance in the volatile crypto market. This event serves as a valuable lesson for everyone involved in cryptocurrencies, from seasoned whales to newcomers dipping their toes into DeFi. By understanding the mechanics of platforms like MakerDAO, recognizing the signs of potential risk, and acting decisively, participants can navigate the DeFi waters more skillfully and safeguard their digital assets.

This will make the token available for trading on regulated exchanges. A Major Step for Thailand’s Crypto Framework It is worth noting that the security agency’s decision is part of updated digital asset regulations that will become operational by March 16, 2025. Reports say that these updated regulations intend to create a more flexible and structured environment for crypto businesses in Thailand. This will ensure a balance between innovation and investor protection. In February, it was reported that the agency requested the positions of industry leaders and experts on digital assets before finalizing the new framework. By approving USD₮, Thailand is taking a significant step toward integrating stablecoins into its financial system. The crypto adoption index shows that the nation is one of the most crypto-friendly jurisdictions. In fact, it is among the top 20 globally for adoption. Notably, USD₮ already accounts for around 40% of trading volumes in Thailand, with Tether’s stablecoin having a market cap of $142 billion. This new approval by the government further strengthens its role in bridging traditional finance and digital assets. Tether’s Commitment to Thailand While speaking on this development, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino, reaffirmed the company’s commitment to the Thai market. He stressed that Tether purpose is clear, to provide users with a secure, transparent, and reliable stablecoin experience. The company also intends to contribute to Thailand’s growing digital asset ecosystem by building a strong and sustainable infrastructure for stablecoins. Thailand’s forward-thinking stance on digital assets makes it a global model for crypto regulation. Unlike regions with uncertain policies, Thailand has taken proactive steps to create a structured and supportive environment for digital finance. Meanwhile, Thailand’s security agency announced plans to launch a trading system for digital tokens last month. Market Trends and Investor Confidence Despite this regulatory breakthrough, market dynamics will be crucial in adopting USD₮. As of this publication, Tether is trading at $1.00, and the trading volume is 113.46% active. In addition, this latest recognition of Tether (USDT), coincides with the firm hiring Simon McWilliams as the new Chief Financial Officer (CFO). The CEO disclosed that McWilliams’ strong background in financial audits was a key reason for his appointment. His appointment will help strengthen investor confidence in Tether’s stability and reliability.

However, ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood remains optimistic despite the price correction. Cathie Wood Shares Insight on Market Outlook According to her recent X post , Cathie Wood strongly believes that the market is seeing economic trends that could bring about a deflationary boom. The Ark Invest CEO has consistently championed a long-term, innovation-driven investment strategy in the past. This recent social media post further stresses her position. She postulated that the U.S. economy is nearing the end of a rolling recession, and Wood believes this process will trigger a major expansion. She also previously mentioned that innovation, particularly in sectors like AI, blockchain, and biotech, will significantly reshape global markets’ approach to digital assets and traditional investments. If her speculation clicks, she noted that the second half of this year could witness a rebound. This projection will be activated by more friendly monetary policies and rising institutional investment in cryptocurrency. Last month, Cathie Wood predicted that the BTC price will hit $1.5 million by 2030. However, the present market volatility suggests otherwise. Bitcoin and Altcoin Outlook Since the start of this year, the crypto market has experienced many intense crypto liquidations amid negative market sentiments. Bitcoin, for instance, is struggling to maintain key support levels. Market data shows that the coin has dropped below the $80,000 mark, down 3.18% in 24 hours. The second leading cryptocurrency, Ethereum, has also seen price fluctuations. The coin is currently trading at $1,852.09, having declined over 10% in the last 24 hours. Other altcoins, including Solana and XRP, have followed similar price declines. This has led to investor sell-offs and holding on to investments. Meanwhile, some analysts, like Cathie Wood, believe this pullback could be part of a healthy correction rather than a prolonged decline. Prospect for Market Rebound Several factors point to a potential market rebound, as experts see the market as oversold. The sustained inflow into spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs might be a catalyst to drive the market rebound. Meanwhile, the Trump administration’s latest introduction of a strategic Bitcoin reserve could lead to a major long-term market rebound. Similarly, institutional interest remains a key factor, with companies like Strategy doubling down on its Bitcoin agenda. Earlier today, CoinGape reported that MicroStrategy wants to raise $21 billion to expand its total Bitcoin holdings.

According to sources familiar with the matter, the order could include directives allowing crypto banks access to the Fed’s payment system and clarifying that stablecoins should not be classified as securities. The executive order is expected to explicitly roll back regulatory measures related to “Operation Chokepoint 2.0,” an alleged initiative under President Joe Biden that restricts banking services for cryptocurrency companies. The Trump administration views these restrictions as detrimental to the growth of the digital asset industry, sources familiar with the matter said. Bo Hines, executive director of the White House Presidential Task Force on Digital Assets, confirmed that an order was in development but declined to provide details. “I think the industry can expect something very soon,” Hines said. Related News: Bitwise Official Says “The Market Is Absolutely Wrong” About The Decline, Shares His Bullish Scenario One of the most significant impacts of Trump’s upcoming executive order could be a shift in the Fed’s stance on granting master accounts to crypto-focused banks. Master accounts provide direct access to the Fed’s payment system, a requirement for banks that serve customers nationwide. Under the Biden administration, the Fed has consistently denied master accounts to crypto-friendly banks like Custodia Bank, effectively preventing them from operating. If implemented, a policy change from the Fed that would grant access to the payment system could represent a major breakthrough for the digital asset industry. However, the Fed is an independent institution and its policies are not determined by the executive branch. According to the Fed’s official policy, its decisions “do not require the approval of the president or anyone in the executive or legislative branches of government.” This could present a legal challenge to any directive that attempts to force the central bank to take action. Senior White House officials are set to meet on Thursday to discuss potential legal challenges before finalizing the executive order, the sources said. The administration aims to ensure the directive withstands legal scrutiny before it reaches President Trump’s desk for his signature. The guidance is also expected to address stablecoins and reaffirm that they should not be classified as securities. If signed, this would be the third cryptocurrency-focused executive order President Trump has issued since taking office. *This is not investment advice.

This requires strong political will, resources, and ongoing commitment from both sides. Harmonizing Regulations: While collaboration is key, fully harmonizing regulations between two sovereign nations can be complex. Differences in legal systems and national priorities may present hurdles. Industry Adaptation: Cryptocurrency businesses operating in these regions will need to adapt to the evolving regulatory landscape. Clear communication and guidance from regulatory bodies will be crucial to ensure smooth transitions and compliance. Global Regulatory Landscape: The global AML and crypto regulation landscape is constantly evolving. El Salvador and Paraguay will need to stay agile and adapt their strategies to remain aligned with international best practices and standards. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? For individuals and businesses involved in cryptocurrency, here are some key takeaways and actionable insights: Increased Regulatory Scrutiny: Expect heightened scrutiny on cryptocurrency service providers operating in El Salvador and Paraguay. Unlicensed operations will likely face increased pressure. Emphasis on Compliance: Businesses should prioritize compliance with AML regulations and licensing requirements in both countries. This proactive approach will be essential for long-term sustainability. Opportunities for Legitimate Businesses: The push for clearer regulation and AML compliance can create a more level playing field, potentially benefiting legitimate and compliant cryptocurrency businesses.

In this category, Bybit was second only to Binance in trading volume before the February 21 hack, with an average of over 25% of the trading volume leading up to the incident. That has now dropped to 10.57% by March 9. Exchanges Market Share (Source: Kaiko) Interstingly, Bybit’s loss was Binance’s gain. The world’s largest exchange was the biggest beneficiary of the user exodus, as trading activity increased significantly after the Bybit hack. It was clear how Binance’s market share increased significantly. Before the hack, Binance was responsible for around 50% of the daily trading volume for centralized offshore exchanges. However, that changed significantly after the hack, with its market share average rising above 60%. Binance. The exchange accounted for 70.5% of the trading volume on February 23, 48 hours after the Bybit hack. Still, other exchanges also saw their market share increase after the incident, even if not at a similar rate to Binance’s. OKX and Coinbase’s share of the trading volume has been relatively higher since the incident. Bybit showing signs of recovery Meanwhile, Bybit’s current market share is a sign of a resurgence in trading activity, showing that some of its users are returning. In the days following the hack, the market share was in a free fall, leading to Bybit’s overall share hitting as low as 5.44% on March 2, just as its share of offshore exchange volume also reached its bottom at 6.42%. This highlights how the exchange’s crisis management enabled it to survive the biggest heist against a financial institution. By choosing not to pause withdrawals during the worst hours of the crisis and keeping users updated, the exchange was able to retain the trust of most in the crypto community. However, efforts to recover the funds have been quite slow. Despite multi-party efforts involving several security experts, only around 3% of the funds have been frozen so far. According to data from Bybit LazarusBounty page, only $43.71 million has been recovered so far. The exchange has also kept its word of giving out 10% of every recovered fund as a bounty. So far, it has paid out $4.32 million to several individuals and organizations that have helped freeze funds or provided information that led to the freezing. Despite this effort, the hackers have been able to convert at least $300 million of the stolen funds, according to data from Elliptic. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The winds of change might be blowing in Washington, D.C., and they could carry a seismic shift for the cryptocurrency industry. Whispers from industry insiders suggest that former President Donald Trump is poised to potentially sign an executive order this week that could dramatically alter the landscape of crypto banking rules in the United States. Could this be the game-changer the crypto world has been waiting for? Let’s dive deep into what this could mean for you, for crypto businesses, and for the future of digital finance. Will Trump’s Executive Order Really Overturn Anti-Crypto Banking Rules? According to a report by Decrypt, citing credible industry sources, the upcoming Trump executive order is expected to directly address and potentially dismantle the current administration’s perceived restrictive stance on crypto banking. The core aim? To pave the way for easier access to traditional banking services for cryptocurrency companies . This move could be a monumental leap forward for the industry, which has long grappled with regulatory hurdles and limited access to the conventional financial system. But what exactly are these ‘anti-crypto banking rules’ that are causing such a stir? Let’s break it down: Perceived Hostility: Many in the crypto industry feel that current regulations and interpretations have created an environment of uncertainty and even hostility towards digital asset businesses. This includes stricter compliance requirements and increased scrutiny from regulatory bodies. Banking Access Challenges: One of the most significant pain points for crypto companies is securing and maintaining relationships with banks. Many traditional financial institutions are hesitant to work with crypto businesses due to regulatory ambiguity, compliance costs, and perceived risks. Master Account Access: Access to master accounts at the Federal Reserve is crucial for payment system efficiency. Currently, very few crypto-focused institutions have been granted these accounts, hindering their ability to operate smoothly within the traditional financial system. If the reports are accurate, Trump’s executive order aims to directly address these challenges. The promise of overturning these perceived ‘anti-crypto’ policies has sent ripples of excitement throughout the crypto community, fueling speculation and hope for a more welcoming regulatory environment. Unpacking the Potential Impact: Access to Banks and the Federal Reserve The most tantalizing aspect of this potential executive order is the promise of facilitating banking access for cryptocurrency companies , specifically mentioning access to master accounts within the Federal Reserve ’s payment system. This is not just about opening checking accounts; it’s about integrating crypto businesses more deeply into the core financial infrastructure of the United States. Imagine a scenario where crypto exchanges, custodians, and payment processors can seamlessly access the same payment rails as traditional financial institutions. The benefits could be transformative: Reduced Operational Friction: Master accounts would streamline payment processing, reduce transaction costs, and enhance operational efficiency for crypto businesses. Increased Trust and Legitimacy: Access to the Fed’s payment system could lend greater legitimacy and trust to the crypto industry in the eyes of both consumers and traditional financial players. Level Playing Field: It could create a more level playing field between traditional financial institutions and emerging crypto companies, fostering innovation and competition. Boost for Innovation: With easier banking access, crypto companies can focus more on innovation and less on navigating complex regulatory hurdles and banking limitations.However, it’s crucial to temper expectations. While a presidential executive order carries significant weight, its practical implementation and long-term impact are not guaranteed. Several factors could influence the actual outcome. The Federal Reserve’s Independence: A Potential Hurdle? The report itself acknowledges a critical point: the Federal Reserve may not be directly influenced by the White House in terms of policy. The Fed is designed to be an independent central bank, insulated from direct political interference. This raises a key question: To what extent can a presidential executive order truly mandate the Fed to grant master accounts or alter its supervisory approach to cryptocurrency companies ? Here’s a balanced perspective: Potential Influence of the Executive Order Limitations Due to Fed Independence Setting Policy Direction: The EO can set a clear policy direction from the executive branch, signaling a desire for a more crypto-friendly banking environment. Directing Regulatory Agencies: The EO could direct other regulatory agencies, such as the Treasury Department or OCC, to take actions that indirectly influence the Fed. Public Pressure: A strong executive order can create public and political pressure on the Fed to reconsider its stance and approach. Operational Independence: The Fed retains operational independence in its decisions regarding master accounts and supervisory policies. Statutory Mandate: The Fed operates under a statutory mandate from Congress, and its actions are guided by its interpretation of those laws. Risk Management: The Fed’s primary concern is the safety and soundness of the financial system. It will likely prioritize risk management considerations when evaluating applications for master accounts, regardless of political pressure. Therefore, while a Trump executive order could be a significant catalyst for change, it’s unlikely to be a magic wand that instantly transforms the Fed’s approach. The Fed will likely continue to apply its rigorous due diligence and risk assessment processes when considering applications from cryptocurrency companies . Navigating the Path Forward: Actionable Insights for Crypto Businesses Regardless of the immediate outcome of this potential executive order, the very prospect of it signals a potential shift in the political winds. For cryptocurrency companies , this is a moment to be proactive and strategic. Here are some actionable insights: Prepare for Increased Scrutiny: Even with a more favorable policy environment, regulatory scrutiny is unlikely to disappear. Crypto businesses should continue to prioritize robust compliance programs and risk management frameworks. Engage with Policymakers: Actively engage with policymakers and regulators to educate them about the crypto industry and advocate for sensible regulations. Industry associations and lobbying efforts can play a crucial role. Strengthen Banking Relationships: Proactively build relationships with banks, even if access is currently limited. Demonstrate a commitment to compliance, transparency, and sound business practices to increase attractiveness as a banking client. Explore Alternative Banking Solutions: While pursuing traditional banking access, explore alternative banking solutions that cater to the crypto industry, such as specialized crypto-friendly banks or fintech platforms. Stay Informed and Adaptable: The regulatory landscape for crypto is constantly evolving. Stay informed about policy developments and be prepared to adapt your business strategies accordingly. Conclusion: A Hopeful Glimmer or a Transformative Dawn for Crypto Banking? The potential Trump executive order to overturn perceived anti- crypto banking rules represents a potentially monumental moment for the cryptocurrency industry. While the extent of its impact, particularly on the independent Federal Reserve , remains to be seen, the symbolic and directional shift could be significant. For cryptocurrency companies , this news offers a powerful glimmer of hope – a potential pathway towards greater integration with the traditional financial system, reduced operational friction, and a more level playing field for innovation. Whether this glimmer evolves into a transformative dawn for crypto banking depends on the specifics of the executive order, the Fed’s response, and the continued advocacy and resilience of the crypto industry itself. One thing is clear: the conversation around crypto and banking is far from over, and the next chapter promises to be intensely interesting.

The second stage of the presale has to raise only $2M to close, opening up the next stage of the project. World Liberty Financial has almost finalized the last stage of its WLFI token presale. A little over 40M tokens remain, with a price tag of $0.05, awaiting inflows of just $2M. The fundraising remained relatively slow, as most of the buying was for retail amounts. The fund is closing its second presale, after previously placing another 25B tokens at $0.015. For now, WLFI has not attracted other large-scale buyers, and most of the purchases are similar to small donations. WLFI continues to be sold most often for Ethereum (ETH) or USDC. WLFI purchases range from as low as $10 in USDC to 3.1ETH for one of the recent additions. The latest stage increased WLFI holders to 85,569 wallets. The fund’s next stage is to run its own version of an Aave vault, providing passive income based on crypto lending. The exact use case of the WLFI token will become clearer in the future, though the asset will remain locked and non-transferable for at least a year after the presale ends. World Liberty Fi portfolio loses $3M in a day World Liberty Fi is more than a fund and was used as an indicator for reliable token selection. Despite this, estimated losses from peak value may be up to $110M . It is hard to estimate the exact losses, since the fund has traded and reorganized its portfolio to retain value. The portfolio’s goal would be to ensure collaterals for an Aave vault, which would produce passive income. For that reason, World Liberty Fi has converted some of its assets into the most widely used collaterals on Aave. As of March 10, the fund’s portfolio based on the main public wallet fell to $75M in value, down $3M in a few hours. A rough estimate shows Ethereum (ETH) is the biggest source of losses, contributing up to 65% for the loss on paper. The fund bets on the Ethereum ecosystem, with ETH and its wrapped versions as the biggest holding. World Liberty Fi consolidated its holdings, with ETH still holding a prominent position. | Source: Arkham Intelligence Currently, the fund retains 7.53K ETH, valued at over $14M. This is the fund’s biggest holding, accrued in the past weeks from WLFI purchases and trading. The fund has been known to trade actively and buy the dip on ETH. Despite this, World Liberty Fi lost 9% of the ETH value in the past day, as the asset sank under $2,000. ETH makes up over 65% of the fund’s holdings, practically making the Trump family Ethereum maximalists. Even Eric Trump, one of the persons closest to the fund, has been taken to task for his recommendation to buy ETH, just before another significant price drawdown. Some of the assets of World Liberty Fi have been moved to other wallets, though one of the public addresses remains the most active, receiving inflows from buyers. World Liberty Fi retains its TRON (TRX) holdings, which have also posted the smallest losses. The fund also expanded its Movement (MOVE) holdings. Overall, World Liberty Fi decreased its token selection, removing some of its tokens from the main wallet. After recent token movements and shifts, the fund’s portfolio is more limited. World Liberty Fi has moved its Ondo (ONDO) and Chainlink (LINK) holdings while onboarding Whitebit (WHITE). Some of the funds were shifted to WBTC, serving both as a DeFi-compatible asset and a tracker of the BTC market price.

The company looks to address inefficiencies in the U.S. derivatives market, where trading has traditionally been limited to fixed hours and contracts with set expirations. Coinbase’s Futures Expansion Targets Institutional and Retail U.S. Traders According to Coinbase , crypto derivatives trading accounts for roughly 75% of global crypto volumes, yet a significant portion of these transactions have occurred outside the U.S. By launching perpetual-style futures contracts, Coinbase seeks to provide American traders access to the same international instruments while ensuring compliance with U.S. regulatory standards.

Coinbase has partnered with Nodal Clear to facilitate clearing services and ensure compliance with CFTC regulations. The exchange stated that introducing 24/7 futures trading is a step toward a more competitive U.S. derivatives market. The company also revealed plans to develop a new type of perpetual-style futures contract modeled after long-dated international offerings, designed to adhere to U.S. regulations. U.S. traders have historically been constrained by fixed trading hours, causing them to miss market movements occurring outside of regular sessions. With these changes, traders can manage risk and execute strategies in real time, eliminating a key limitation in the domestic market. Coinbase has been working with the CFTC and market participants to finalize the design of the new products. The company’s plans signal an effort to expand regulated crypto derivatives offerings in the U.S., where offshore platforms have traditionally held an advantage. Coinbase Expands U.S. Presence Amid CFTC’s Push for Digital Asset Innovation In February, Coinbase took a major step in the U.S. crypto derivatives market, introducing CFTC-approved futures contracts for Solana (SOL) and Hedera (HBAR). These contracts, structured for diverse trading strategies, add to Coinbase Derivatives’ growing portfolio, which now includes 19 futures contracts, such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and Dogecoin (DOGE).

Following the White House Crypto Summit, Armstrong expressed optimism about the industry’s growth potential under the current administration. While policy changes have sparked optimism, the ultimate direction of crypto regulation in the U.S. remains uncertain. How Coinbase’s move into perpetual futures influences the broader U.S. market—and whether regulatory clarity materializes—will be pivotal in shaping crypto’s domestic future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How might continuous futures trading reshape market dynamics? By enabling constant trading, nonstop futures boost liquidity and refine price discovery, yet may trigger swift price shifts if risk management systems fail to adapt to the faster pace. What regulatory hurdles could emerge from round-the-clock trading? Expanding trading hours require regulators to heighten oversight and adapt rules. Balancing market innovation with investor safeguards remains a challenge, as continuous trading complicates traditional risk monitoring. How could nonstop futures affect U.S. market competitiveness? Nonstop futures could strengthen the U.S. market standing by aligning domestic practices with global trends. This may foster better risk controls and encourage wider investor participation, enhancing overall market resilience.

The filing makes it the first ETF associated with the recently decentralized blockchain. Movement has announced that it is set to launch the beta version of the mainnet. In a prospectus filed on Monday, the fund will devote 80% of the net as MOVE tokens or related derivatives by channeling the fund into a REX-Osprey MOVE Subsidiary. The approval of the SEC requires an acknowledgment from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission before any action can be taken on it. Movement’s co-founder Rushi Manche highlighted that the ETF filing was an important step for the company. “Breaking the pattern of ETFs limited to long-established cryptocurrencies opens doors for institutional capital to support next-generation blockchain innovation,” Manche stated. Recent ETF applications for altcoins, including XRP, SOL, and HEDERA, reveal an increasing trend of seeking institutional investment and adopting digital assets. Rex Shares and Osprey Funds had also requested funds tracking assets, including BONK, DOGE, and TRUMP memecoin. Movement’s development and controversies Movement was built using the MoveOS programming language initially by Meta, a company that had planned to use it on Diem, its former stablecoin. Its implementation has also been criticized for not being transparent enough. The Movement Network Foundation officially released Movement Mainnet Beta on 30th November, but its deployment was delayed until 9th December. The network recently incorporated RPC service, and a core mainnet release is expected before the 10th of March. This ecosystem will launch the Cornucopia program to seed $250 million for the Movement Public Mainnet Beta. However, the team has faced much criticism over its political affiliations. Manche earlier defined politics as a major approach of crypto companies, other blockchain initiatives share the same opinion to inevitably adapt to the pro-crypto Trump administration. An unplanned Movement devnet launch in January raised some eyebrows after a DeFi startup, World Liberty Financial, connected to the Trump family, bought $2 million worth of MOVE tokens just a few minutes before reports emerged that indicated Movement was in talks with Musk about some integration to blockchain. Manche also dismissed accusations of insider trading. Under the leadership of the new commissioner, Acting Chair Mark T. Uyeda, the SEC is more friendly towards the crypto space. However, it has not authorized ETFs indexed to anything besides Bitcoin and Ethereum. The Movement ETF filing will go through the approval process before any action is made.

March Predictions Are In!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/what-will-solanas-future-be-march-forecasts-are-in/,"Solana (SOL) is facing a tough month with forecasters predicting further declines in its price throughout March. According to Polymarket data, the probability of Solana breaking above its all-time high of $300 this month has dropped to just 1% from 9% on March 2. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency has a 72% chance of falling to $110 from its current price of $118.94. Solana’s struggles come amid broader turmoil in the cryptocurrency market. SOL has lost nearly 60% of its value since President Donald Trump took office. The decline is not limited to Solana, as rival cryptocurrency XRP is also facing a similar downtrend. A number of factors contributed to this decline, including Trump’s volatile trade policies with China and allied countries, his pro-crypto stance falling short of industry expectations, and the $1.5 billion hack of the Bybit exchange. Related News: SEC Takes Action on Anti-Cryptocurrency Rule from Gary Gensler's Era, They're Changing It Solana’s reputation also took a hit in February when Argentine President Javier Milei introduced the Libra memecoin, which was launched on the Solana network. The token reached a market value of $4 billion before crashing 80% in an hour, costing investors $1.6 billion in losses. Adding to the uncertainty, Polymarket forecasters have lowered their expectations for Solana’s potential inclusion in the newly announced U.S. strategic crypto reserve. On March 2, when Trump unexpectedly announced the establishment of the reserve and suggested it could include Solana, the probability of SOL being included had reached 42%. However, those odds have since dropped to 23%. The probability of a Solana exchange-traded fund (ETF) being approved in 2025 also fell to 79% from 86% over the weekend, according to Polymarket, further dampening optimism. Several asset managers, including Franklin Templeton, have filed applications for a Solana ETF, some of which have been accepted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). *This is not investment advice.

While some of the old-school players like Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to dominate, many newer altcoins are now stepping up to the plate, offering massive opportunities for those brave enough to take the plunge. The challenge, though, is spotting the gems before they hit the mainstream. Take Cardano, for example—it’s one of those coins that people thought had all the potential in the world, yet it’s been slipping under the radar for too long. Big returns? It’s not looking likely anymore. On the flip side, Qubetics ($TICS) is a crypto that’s rising through the ranks fast, and it’s not just hype. The $TICS presale is already in its 25th stage, and experts are predicting jaw-dropping gains in the near future. For anyone looking to snag one of the top cryptos for significant returns in 2025, don’t let this one pass by. Sure, Cardano had its time in the sun, but there are new contenders offering even greater potential for those who know where to look. When thinking about top cryptos for significant returns, it’s crucial to identify projects that go beyond just being another “altcoin.” These are the projects that address real-world problems, making them the go-to solutions for industries and individuals alike. Qubetics is one such project that stands out, especially with its game-changing application, QubeQode IDE, which has real-world use cases that many existing cryptos can’t match. In short, while Cardano’s time may be behind it, Qubetics is where the future lies. Cardano Coin: A Missed Opportunity for Big Returns? If you’ve been following the crypto space for a while, you probably remember when Cardano was all the rage. It’s a coin that had its time in the spotlight and a loyal following, but today, it feels like Cardano’s ship has sailed. The hype around it was real in the early stages. The promise of scalability, a strong academic backing, and a robust development ecosystem had people believing Cardano could be the next big thing. Fast forward a few years, and things just didn’t pan out the way people hoped. One of the major reasons Cardano didn’t live up to expectations is the fact that it’s been slow to roll out key features. While other cryptos have been iterating fast, Cardano has often been criticized for taking its sweet time, which means it’s not always as competitive as it needs to be. Additionally, the market has moved on, and with so many new projects emerging, Cardano just doesn’t seem to have that same “wow” factor it once did. Cardano was supposed to be the “Ethereum killer,” but it’s been hard to find that killer instinct. Looking at Cardano’s current market position, it’s clear that significant returns aren’t going to come easy for anyone still holding the coin. Sure, there may still be some occasional spikes, but for anyone thinking about getting into Cardano now, it’s tough to imagine the kind of explosive gains that were once predicted. By the time the ship finally comes in, those hoping for top cryptos for significant returns in 2025 might have missed out. It’s a classic example of how waiting too long on a project can result in missed opportunities. Qubetics: A Real Opportunity in 2025 for Top Cryptos for Significant Returns Now, let’s talk about Qubetics. It’s not just another flashy cryptocurrency with a bold name and promises of moonshots. This is a project that actually delivers—one that is actively addressing real-world problems and has all the makings of a massive hit in 2025 and beyond. The $TICS presale is in its 25th stage right now, and it’s been selling fast. So far, over 498 million tokens have been sold to more than 22,700 holders, raising over $14.9 million. But the real story here is what Qubetics is doing with its technology—specifically the QubeQode IDE. QubeQode IDE is a game-changer. Imagine a tool that allows businesses, software developers, and individuals to build and deploy decentralized applications (dApps) with ease. For someone who’s been stuck using clunky, outdated software for years, QubeQode is a breath of fresh air. It streamlines the development process, removes unnecessary barriers, and puts power back in the hands of those who need it most. For developers, QubeQode is a platform where they can create apps without the usual bottlenecks, cutting down on time spent on coding, testing, and debugging. Let’s break this down with real-life scenarios. Think about a small business owner who’s tired of relying on centralized platforms for all their transactions. With Qubetics, they can easily build and implement blockchain-based solutions that can save time and reduce costs. Maybe you’re a developer who wants to build a decentralized social media platform. Using QubeQode, you’d be able to quickly put together a secure, scalable application without the usual headaches. The possibilities are endless. And here’s the kicker: Analysts are predicting some serious gains for $TICS once the presale ends. Right now, $TICS is priced at just $0.1074, but by the end of the crypto presale , it could be worth $0.25, representing a 132% return on investment. After the presale? Experts are talking about $TICS reaching $1, $5, and even $15—imagine an ROI of 830% or more. If $TICS hits $15, that’s an astronomical 13,859% return. Analysts believe that $TICS could hit the $10-$15 mark after the mainnet launch. If you’re still sitting on the sidelines, now is the time to get in before this ship sails too. Why Qubetics Stands Out as One of the Top Cryptos for Significant Returns The beauty of Qubetics lies in its unique approach to solving real-life problems. Unlike many cryptocurrencies that focus solely on being a store of value or currency, Qubetics is about building real-world applications with lasting impact. Whether you’re a tech professional, a business owner, or even someone just trying to make their daily life a bit easier, Qubetics offers something that actually works. It’s one of the few projects in the crypto space where the underlying technology has real utility. And as the crypto market grows, the demand for innovative solutions like Qubetics is only going to increase. With the Qubetics presale ongoing and analysts predicting significant price growth in 2025, now is the perfect time to get involved with one of the top cryptos for significant returns. The combination of strong utility, real-world applications, and high growth potential makes Qubetics a no-brainer for anyone looking to capitalize on the future of blockchain technology. Conclusion The market is full of opportunities for those who know where to look. Cardano, once touted as a leader in the space, now feels like a missed opportunity. Meanwhile, Qubetics is poised for huge success, with its unique technology and presale momentum indicating significant price growth in the near future. As more people realize the potential of $TICS, it’s only a matter of time before it breaks out in a big way. So, if you’re looking for top cryptos for significant returns in 2025, don’t sleep on Qubetics. The time to act is now.

Park had been released on bail pending allegations of orchestrating an alleged $60 million crypto scam that centers on a token named Podo Coin. Scam Coin Allegations: Fresh Arrest Warrant for Market Maker The newspaper Seoul Kyungjae reported that the newly formalized Joint Investigation Unit for Virtual Asset Crimes (JIU) , part of the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors’ Office, has now been charged with a separate offence. Cars seized from ‘scam coin’ suspect and crypto market maker Jon Bur Kim in prosecution raids. (Source: Maeil Kyungjae/Screenshot) Prosecutors think that Park helped list and issue an alleged “scam coin” named Artube (ATT). They think that Park and his associates use the token to dupe investors out of a total of 260 billion won ($179.6 million). Notable crypto exchanges , including South Korea’s Coinone, have previously listed ATT. But ATT trading volumes and coin value have plummeted in more recent times. Trading volumes on the South Korean crypto exchange Coinone over the past 12 months. (Source: CoinGecko) Following its listing, ATT prices initially surged. However, prices began to fall soon after. In early February last year, Coinone designated ATT as a coin of concern, citing the following reasons: suspension of official community activities inactivity of major businesses and services failure to inform investors about major short-term and mid- to long-term business plans failure to disclose related information in a timely manner Coinone, EconomyBloc reported last year, contacted the “project team” for answers, but was unsatisfied with the developers’ response. On February 20, Coinone wrote that it had decided to “end trading support for ATT to protect investors.” Transaction support was ended in early March, with withdrawal support following a month later.

Dogecoin Is Currently Testing The Lower Bound Of An Ascending Channel In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed about a long-term pattern forming in the weekly price of Dogecoin. The pattern in question is the “Ascending Channel” from technical analysis (TA), which is a type of Parallel Channel. A Parallel Channel is a consolidation pattern in which the price of the asset remains locked between two parallel trendlines. The upper level of the channel is likely to provide resistance, while the lower one can be a point of support. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Signal Aligns With Price Tops, CryptoQuant Analyst Reveals Breaks out of either of these lines can imply a continuation of trend in that direction. That is, an escape above the channel is bullish, while a drop under it is bearish. Parallel Channels can be categorized into three types, based on the alignment of the trendlines with respect to the coordinate axes. Channels that are slopped upwards (that is, those that have trendlines that follow higher lows and higher highs) are known as Ascending Channels. While an asset is inside this type of channel, its price witnesses consolidation to the net upside Similarly, those of the opposite orientation are called Descending Channels and represent consolidation to the net downside. The third case, where the trendlines are parallel to the time-axis, has no special name. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst, that shows an Ascending Channel that the weekly price of Dogecoin has been trading inside for the past decade: As is visible above, the 1-week Dogecoin price has witnessed a sharp decline recently and is nearing in on the lower level of the channel situated at $0.16. The last time that the memecoin retested the line was during the last few months of 2024 and it successfully found support back then. “All eyes on Dogecoin $DOGE! If it holds this level at $0.16 and bounces, a move to $2 could be next!” notes the analyst. This $2 target is roughly around where the asset would meet the middle line of the channel, a level that has also shown interactions with its price in the past. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Signal: $900 Million In BTC Leaves Exchanges It only remains to be seen, though, whether the memecoin will indeed find support and the Ascending Channel will continue to hold. There is always the chance of a breakdown with patterns like these, which, as mentioned earlier, can lead to bearish price action. DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is floating around $0.176, down more than 20% over the last seven days.

The addition is a nod to the company’s healthy fiscal outlook, giving it some leeway to outdo mining-specific challenges that may arise, especially following a halving that happened in April 2024. While most industry participants are fighting for their lives, CleanSpark has overcome those odds and become one of the most successful public Bitcoin miners of 2025. CleanSpark performance has been consistent throughout the period CleanSpark chief executive officer and president, Zack Bradford, has been enjoying the success of a stronger business model, which has led to CleanSpark’s addition to the S&P SmallCap 600 Index. The addition creates value, a cascade opportunity, and a more diversified investment, but it also creates, as he puts it, “vertical integration” in Bitcoin mining. CleanSpark’s profits surged to $241.7 million, or $0.85 per share, in the final quarter of 2024, up from just $25.9 million a year earlier. This represents an 833% rise YoY. Company-wide revenues jumped 120% on a year-over-year basis to $162.3 million. As of February 2025, CleanSpark’s BTC holdings rose 6% to 11,177 BTC, positioning it as one of the top five public BTC mining and holding companies. The Bitcoin mining business has been struggling since halving in April 2024. This placed other players in the mining industry in a weaker economic position and caused them to look for alternate sources of revenue. AI data centre build-outs are also taking a market share that rightly deserves to be taken away from the old-school Bitcoin mining business, which is far more profitable. CleanSpark has succeeded when everyone else is feeling pressed Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in the parts of the economy that are now severely bottlenecked remain one surefire way to stifle competition early. However, the biggest moves in the industry have already occurred. According to JPMorgan, Riot Platforms and CleanSpark, which have aggressively expanded their holdings, have fortified their positions competitively. As many Bitcoin miners navigate shifts within the industry, CleanSpark has a more bullish outlook. The April 2024 Bitcoin halving event that reduced block reward and miner revenues forced many companies to revise their strategies. Consequently, a few mining companies turned to AI data centers, which have been considerably more profitable. This transition remains largely under the general public’s radar, as Nvidia GPUs dedicated to AI model training operate at vastly greater scales than those used for Bitcoin mining. With this evolution comes a wave of M&A in the industry as smaller firms struggle to survive. JPMorgan also points out that CleanSpark and Riot Platforms have aggressively pursued acquisitions to increase their market share. In contrast, capital-constrained miners such as IREN and Cipher have pursued a more disciplined path, searching for alternative forms of revenue with lower capital needs.

The Meteoric Rise of Official TRUMP Coin Launched on January 17, 2025, just days before President Donald Trump’s inauguration, the Official TRUMP Coin ($TRUMP) took the crypto world by storm. Hosted on the Solana blockchain, $TRUMP debuted with an initial coin offering (ICO) of 200 million tokens, priced between $7 and $8 each. Within 24 hours, the coin’s value skyrocketed over 300%, reaching a market capitalization exceeding $14 billion. The coin’s distribution was notably centralized, with 80% of the total supply retained by Trump-affiliated entities, CIC Digital LLC and Fight Fight Fight LLC, to be released gradually over three years. This concentration raised eyebrows among investors and ethics experts, sparking debates about potential conflicts of interest and market manipulation. Despite these concerns, early investors who seized the opportunity during the ICO reaped substantial rewards. The coin peaked at $74.59 before stabilizing around $52, offering significant returns for those who entered early. However, as with many meme coins, $TRUMP’s price experienced volatility, emphasizing the importance of timing in such investments. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, Arctic Pablo Coin emerges as a compelling opportunity for those seeking exponential returns in the meme coin space. Its unique presale structure, attractive staking rewards, and deflationary mechanisms make it a standout choice among the top new meme coins for exponential returns.

Expert Weighs In,https://cryptopotato.com/is-bitcoin-immune-to-stock-market-volatility-expert-weighs-in/,"Bitcoin, the number one cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is facing market turbulence, but prominent trader CrediBULL Crypto remains unfazed. He argues that BTC’s correlation with traditional stocks is overstated, and maintains that the asset’s long-term trajectory remains intact. Bitcoin’s Correlation With Stocks: Overblown Fears? The recent dip in the price of Bitcoin, where it dropped below $80,000, has sparked debate over its ties to traditional financial markets. Some analysts fear the weaknesses witnessed in equities could spill over into crypto. However, CrediBULL Crypto is of the opinion that the S&P 500’s correction is a normal market movement rather than a sign of deeper trouble. “The correction we have seen thus far on it, for all intents and purposes, is considered healthy/normal based on my system,” the trader wrote on X. He highlighted that historically, BTC has moved independently, even during times of macroeconomic uncertainty. While mainstream finance experts see risk, CrediBULL views the current dip as an opportunity for patient investors. “Charts that look ‘cooked’ present the most lucrative opportunities,” he asserted , dismissing concerns about looming economic slowdowns. The investor, with more than 465,000 followers on X, advised traders to focus on Bitcoin’s technical levels rather than stock market trends. According to him, the original cryptocurrency is forming a base between key resistance and support zones, leading him to believe that holding current levels would be a bullish indicator. However, market analysts such as Peter Brandt and BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, have pointed to a potential drop below $80,000 for BTC. Brandt has noted a double-top pattern, warning that the cryptocurrency needs to reclaim $90,000 to reverse bearish sentiment. On his part, Hayes sees a potential retest of $78,000, with $75,000 as the next downside target if the asset’s weakness persists. Market Sentiment While the coin is still up 18.6% across 12 months, its current price is 25% lower than its all-time high level of $108,786 recorded earlier in the year. Despite the pullback, long-term sentiment has improved. Even though the Fear and Greed Index shifted from 92 a year ago, signaling “extreme greed,” to a recent low of 10 , indicating “extreme fear,” the price of Bitcoin is still nearly 20% higher than it was then. For now, investors are urged to stay patient and have a strategy for both bearish and bullish turns. “Key is to have a plan for either outcome so you literally can’t lose,” is CrediBULL’s advice.

Every time everyone shouts that this time is different.” According to Barhydt, the current pullback mirrors market movements from 2017, when increased fiat liquidity led to significant asset price gains. He suggests that underlying macroeconomic conditions remain largely the same, suggesting that Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory is still on track. Related News: SEC Takes Action on Anti-Cryptocurrency Rule from Gary Gensler's Era, They're Changing It Barhydt outlined several key economic factors that he believes will drive future liquidity in financial markets, including Bitcoin: Lower Treasury yields to refinance debt. Lower mortgage rates to unlock residential and commercial real estate markets. Lower Treasury yields to support struggling banks. He also pointed to China’s economic struggles, saying the country is in a deep recession and is likely to benefit from lower U.S. interest rates, which could allow for more monetary easing. Barhydt predicts significant job losses in the coming months in the government, technology and housing sectors. However, he expects the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) index to rise during this period, suggesting continued economic activity. “All of this tells us that liquidity will continue to flow and markets will do what they always do in these types of cycles,” he explained, adding: “That liquidity will flow into stocks, into Bitcoin, into crypto, into real estate.” While Bitcoin’s sudden drop has alarmed many, Barhydt remains optimistic, arguing that the current downturn is a temporary pullback in a larger liquidity-driven growth cycle. “One more time… fasten your seat belts,” he said. *This is not investment advice.

Crypto trader Ali Martinez tells his 131,400 followers on the social media platform X that the top five dollar-pegged crypto assets by market cap have a total valuation of $204.7 billion. The five largest stablecoins in the market include Tether’s USDT , Circle’s USDC , USDS , Ethena’s USDe and DAI , according to data from CoinGecko . Source: Ali Martinez/X A soaring stablecoin market cap suggests more buying power on the sidelines. It may also suggest that investors are unloading their crypto assets in favor of dollar-pegged coins. Looking at Ethena ( ENA ), a decentralized protocol designed to provide a crypto-based alternative to the traditional banking system, Martinez says the altcoin is flashing a bullish signal based on the Tom DeMark Sequential indicator. Traders use the TD Sequential Indicator to predict potential trend reversals for tokens based on the closing prices of their 13 previous bars or candles. “Ethena ENA is flashing bullish signals! A buy signal from the TD Sequential indicator on the weekly chart, combined with a hammer candlestick at key support, suggests a strong rebound could be ahead.” Source: Ali Martinez/X A hammer candlestick pattern is typically viewed as a bullish reversal signal with the candle wick indicating demand. At time of writing, ENA is trading for $0.44. The trader adds that the decentralized oracle network Chainlink ( LINK ) and the modular blockchain Celestia ( TIA ) are also showing signs of a potential rebound based on the TD Sequential indicator. At time of writing, LINK is worth $14.30 and TIA is trading for $3.11.

His earlier stance indicates a preference for measured, conventional monetary policies. Renewed focus on his views hints at possible shifts in Canada’s economic and regulatory strategies. Canada’s Prime Minister-designate, Mark Carney, previously expressed skepticism over Bitcoin’s viability, notably calling cryptocurrencies indicative of financial bubbles and limited in utility during a 2018 speech. Incoming Canadian PM Mark Carney On BTC Carney, who headed the Bank of England from 2013 to 2020, questioned Bitcoin’s viability at the Scottish Economics Conference at Edinburgh University in 2018 in a speech titled “The Future of Money.” https://twitter.com/liberal_party/status/1898864551551959478 Carney argued that cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin inherently possess serious economic deficiencies due to their fixed supply rules. “Far from being strengths, the fixed supply rules of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are serious deficiencies,” Carney said. “Fundamentally, they would impart a deflationary bias on the economy if such currencies were to be widely adopted.” Additionally, the former Bank of Canada head highlighted that prices of digital assets at the time exhibited “classic hallmarks of bubbles,” including increased retail enthusiasm, new paradigm justifications, and extrapolative price predictions. “The long, charitable answer is that cryptocurrencies act as money, at best, only for some people and to a limited extent, and even then only in parallel with the traditional currencies of the users,” he continued. “The short answer is they are failing.” Canada-U.S. Trade War Continues Carney’s comments resurfaced shortly after he won Canada’s federal election, replacing outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who announced his resignation two months ago. U.S. President Donald Trump has frequently dangled the carrot of costly tariffs against both Canada and Mexico in recent weeks in a bid to curb his concerns over alleged drug trafficking and inadequate border control measures connected to the two countries. Observers argue that the tariffs in question could be counterproductive to U.S. economic interests, with stocks dropping on Monday amid growing recession fears. https://twitter.com/FOX9/status/1899217731788132684 In his victory speech on Monday, Carney vowed to win the ongoing trade war with the U.S. , while President Trump has yet to respond. As Mark Carney prepares to take office, Canadians and global markets alike will closely monitor how his past skepticism towards cryptocurrencies influences his economic policies. Equally notable is how Carney navigates the delicate relationship with the United States amid escalating tariff tensions. Ultimately, his ability to manage these interconnected economic and diplomatic challenges may define both his tenure as Prime Minister and Canada’s financial landscape for years to come. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How might Carney’s historical stance on Bitcoin shape Canada’s digital currency regulation? Carney’s longstanding Bitcoin skepticism indicates he may endorse tighter crypto regulations. His policy focus appears aimed at protecting market stability and mitigating speculative risks in Canada’s financial system. What could be the broader economic effects if Carney implements stricter crypto oversight? Stricter crypto oversight may bolster Canada’s financial stability by curbing market volatility and excessive speculation, but could also temper the rapid growth of digital finance within an evolving global economy. How does global economic uncertainty impact Carney’s regulatory approach to digital finance? Facing global economic uncertainty, Carney advocates a cautious regulatory approach that limits exposure to volatile digital assets while upholding traditional financial safeguards amid market shifts.

We get attacked every day, but this was done with a lot of resources. Either a large, coordinated group and/or a country is involved. Tracing …” he wrote on X . In March 2023, the platform also experienced over an hour of glitches, as links stopped working, some users were unable to log in, and images did not load for others. Elon Musk faces cyberattacks, falling Tesla sales, and targeted vandalism Over the last few days, Elon Musk has been tackling a slew of problems across his businesses, X, Tesla, and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). He is growing increasingly suspicious that these are actually all part of a coordinated attack on his companies. Elon Musk explained the outages in terms of a “massive cyberattack” that, he said, took a lot of resources to carry out, perhaps implicating a large coordinated group or a state actor. He said the attack originated from IP addresses in the Ukraine region but did not offer evidence to support that assertion. At the same time, Tesla has been facing plummeting sales and public blowback. Recently, the company reported a 15% decrease in stock value. Tesla stores have also been the targets of vandalism and protests. For example, an AR-15-style rifle was used to attack a Tesla showroom in Salem, Oregon, in February, while four Tesla Cybertrucks in Seattle were set on fire. In an interview with Fox’s Larry Kudlow on Monday, billionaire Elon Musk admitted that his involvement with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Donald Trump’s initiative to reduce federal spending, is making it tougher to run his many businesses: X, Tesla, xAI, SpaceX, The Boring Company, and Starlink. #Teslatakedown protests escalate as Musk suggests coordinated attack Meanwhile, the incidents come on the heels of the #Teslatakedown movement that protests Musk’s role in the Trump administration as well as his management of DOGE. Demonstrators have staged sit-ins outside Tesla showrooms across the country, calling on consumers to stop buying Tesla products and divest from the company. While the convergence of events has spurred theories of a coordinated opposition to Musk’s endeavors, Musk himself chimed in affirmatively to a user that recent accusations, including protests against DOGE, attacks on Tesla stores, and the cyberattack on X, might all be connected. Details are still developing, but so far, there has been little evidence to link the incidents. Experts have warned against jumping to conclusions without thorough investigations. Nicholas Reese, an adjunct professor at New York University’s Center for Global Affairs, said a state conducting such a cyberattack was not likely, and the outages were relatively short-lived. He said technical data from X should support such claims. Elon Musk’s businesses are grappling with a wave of scrutiny, from hackers and public protesters to falling stock prices. Although Musk believes there’s an organized effort behind these occurrences, concrete proof has not materialized. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) said in a March 10 statement that it received 2,668 complaints in 2024 and found seven types of scams they didn’t have on record yet, such as fake Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining schemes, where fraudsters offer fake investments in mining. The DFPI also received complaints about fake crypto gaming schemes, where users are encouraged to deposit funds only to have their wallets drained , and fraudsters offering fake jobs that require victims to transfer crypto and provide private information. Source: California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation Victims also reported the theft of private keys through fake airdrops, fake investment group scams in WhatsApp or Telegram, AI Investment scams offering unusually high returns and losing their crypto after interacting with certain sham websites. The AI industry experienced significant growth in 2024 , reaching a market cap of $638 billion, according to Precedence Research. There was also a notable rise in crimeware-as-a-service (CaaS), where experienced hackers and cybercriminals sell their tools and services to less experienced offenders for a price. DFPI Commissioner KC Mohseni said the regulator is urging caution when interacting with unknown platforms and to “verify website domains to avoid fraudulent imitations, and stay wary of crypto recovery scam sites.” Through its partnership with the State, the DFPI says it shut down more than 26 fraudulent crypto websites and uncovered $4.6 million in user losses last year. California DOJ shuts down 42 crypto scam websites California’s Department of Justice (DOJ) took down 42 crypto scam websites in 2024 that stole $6.5 million from victims, with an average loss per person of $146,306. In a March 10 statement , the California DOJ said that because international fraudsters often carry out scams, they are difficult to prosecute and arrest. Common threads among the scam websites were promises of high returns, no contact information, offers of prizes for signing up, and no listings on legitimate crypto industry websites such as CoinMarketCap, the California DOJ said.

The stock, which trades under MicroStrategy, lost 17% on Monday, sinking to $239.27—a devastating drop from its $473.83 peak in November, according to data from Google Finance. The company has now lost nearly 50% of its value as economic uncertainty, Trump’s policies, and Bitcoin’s own struggles slam the crypto-focused firm. Saylor turned Strategy into a Bitcoin-heavy holding company, a decision that once excited investors looking for exposure to the crypto without directly buying it. The company’s plan to raise $42 billion through debt and stock sales to fund more Bitcoin purchases only added to the frenzy. But now, with the market turning sour, that approach is looking a lot riskier. Bitcoin’s drop and Trump’s policies are dragging Strategy down The sharp decline in Strategy’s stock comes as Bitcoin itself is losing momentum. The OG crypto fell by 4% on Monday, trading around $80,000, after the Trump administration confirmed that the planned Bitcoin reserve would not involve new purchases. Instead, the government will only use the tokens it already owns, allowing only budget-neutral strategies for acquiring more. That announcement killed the speculation that had been fueling Strategy’s rally. Investors had hoped that Trump’s return to office would mean massive government Bitcoin purchases, potentially boosting prices. Instead, they’re getting nothing. “There’s specifics to the crypto trade, and then there’s the overall risk trade, neither of which is particularly helpful for Bitcoin,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. He added that Strategy, as a highly leveraged Bitcoin proxy, is now in even deeper trouble. Trade wars, mass firings, and market chaos are piling on But it’s not just crypto. The entire market is under pressure, and Trump’s trade war is making things worse. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 900 points Monday, while the Nasdaq recorded its worst day since 2022 and the S&P 500 dropped 2.7%. The uncertainty started when Trump reimposed 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada, after briefly pausing them. That policy whiplash has spooked investors, adding to the broader fears about the economy. Meanwhile, inside the government, Elon Musk, a key Trump adviser, is leading an effort to fire thousands of federal employees. That shake-up is only adding to the instability. Markets that once cheered Trump’s economic approach are now backtracking, as investors see more unpredictability ahead. Trump, who once used stock market performance as a bragging point, has suddenly stopped talking about it. Instead, the White House is spinning a different story—that business leaders are still optimistic. “We’re seeing a strong divergence between the animal spirits of the stock market and what’s actually unfolding in business,” said a White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity, per a report from CNBC. Jim Cramer tells investors to not be scared over Monday’s stock selloff Some investors are no longer waiting around to see what happens. Wall Street is now bracing for a recession, and CNBC’s Jim Cramer says the market is terrified by Trump’s policy shifts. “Of course, not many investors saw this coming—and that’s incredible to me,” Jim said Monday. “Virtually overnight, they’ve decided that we’re headed for a recession, and it’s going to happen fast.” He compared the situation to Herbert Hoover, the president who worsened the Great Depression by raising tariffs. And he pointed to a new threat that’s freaking out tech investors: China’s DeepSeek, a startup that may have found a way to run AI technology cheaper and more efficiently than the current leaders. Tech stocks, which had been driving market gains, are now in retreat. Investors who rushed to buy “recession-proof” stocks on Monday ended up overpaying, according to Jim. Others got burned on panic-selling. Some traders, he said, “were ripped off on their buys”, as they scrambled to move money into safer investments. He warned against buying into the hype of recession-proof stocks too early and advised investors to focus on low-multiple techs, industrials, and banks. As for big tech giants, the so-called “Magnificent Seven”, Jimmy declared that the group “no longer exists” in the way it once did. That’s a major change in market sentiment and another sign that investors are rethinking everything. Jim also told investors to not let Monday’s sell-off “scare you out of the market entirely.” For now, Strategy’s fate remains directly linked to Bitcoin’s performance. If the crypto market continues to weaken, Saylor’s plan to fund future purchases with debt and stock sales could become a major liability. Investors aren’t willing to bet on Bitcoin at these levels, and that’s leaving Strategy in a vulnerable position. Right now, nobody is stepping in to save it.

Officials in the European Union (EU) are warning that Washington’s growing embrace of Bitcoin and dollar-backed stablecoins could seriously threaten Europe’s financial sovereignty. Pierre Gramegna, managing director of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), said Monday in Brussels that the U.S. stance on crypto raises concerns, especially as the European Central Bank (ECB) is still undecided on launching a digital euro. “The US administration is favorable toward cryptocurrencies and especially dollar-denominated stablecoins, which may raise certain concerns in Europe,” Gramegna told reporters. He warned that Trump’s push for crypto-backed financial tools could allow American and foreign tech giants to roll out mass payment systems based on stablecoins, potentially undermining the euro’s dominance. Trump moves forward with Bitcoin reserve Trump is not waiting for approval from anyone. Last week, he signed an executive order setting up a Bitcoin reserve and a second storage system for crypto assets seized through legal cases. The decision locks crypto into the U.S. government’s financial system, a major shift from past policies where officials treated it with suspicion. While the U.S. doubles down on crypto, Europe remains hesitant. The ECB has been developing a digital euro since 2021, but its final decision is still months away. Unlike the U.S., the ECB has refused to consider Bitcoin for its monetary reserves. Now, with Trump’s latest move, European leaders say they need to accelerate their work to prevent financial instability in the region. “The digital euro is today more necessary than ever,” Gramegna said, backing the ECB’s urgency. The ESM believes the EU must launch the digital euro soon to protect its monetary autonomy. Not everyone in Europe agrees on how to handle crypto. Christine Lagarde, president of the ECB, made it clear in January that Bitcoin will never be part of the EU’s official reserves. “I’m confident that Bitcoins will not enter the reserves of any of the central banks of the General Council,” Lagarde said. She was responding to statements from Ales Michl, governor of the Czech National Bank (CNB), who said his institution might explore Bitcoin investments in December 2024. The Czech Republic is part of the EU but doesn’t use the euro. Still, Michl’s comments caused enough of a stir that Lagarde had to address them. She emphasized that ECB policymakers agree on keeping reserves liquid, secure, and free from risks like money laundering. “I had a good conversation with my colleague from the Czech Republic and I leave it to him to make whatever announcement he wants to make,” Lagarde said. But she insisted that the ECB will not accept Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Czech National Bank considered crypto for a second Michl confirmed in an interview with the Financial Times in December that the bank is looking into the possibility of adding Bitcoin to its reserves, with a potential allocation of 5%. He later clarified on X that discussions were still in the early stages. On January 28, the Czech finance minister expressed concerns about the idea, whilst hinting a bit at division within the country’s leadership. Meanwhile, the CNB’s seven-member policy board approved a plan to analyze new investment options, though they didn’t directly mention crypto. “At the proposal of Governor Ales Michl, the CNB is to assess whether it would be appropriate in terms of diversification and return to include other asset classes,” the board said in a statement. No final decision has been made, and changes won’t happen until the analysis is complete. Not everyone is convinced that Bitcoin belongs in national reserves. Last month, Christian Lindner, former German finance minister, floated the idea of using Bitcoin as a reserve asset, but the reaction was mostly negative. Joachim Nagel, president of Germany’s Bundesbank, literally Bitcoin to the tulip mania that crashed the Dutch economy in the 1600s. “Reserve assets must be secure, liquid, and transparent,” Nagel said. “Bitcoin is none of these things.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Market analysts believe certain economic factors could trigger a strong rebound amid these concerns. Crypto expert and Abra CEO Bill Barhydt has pointed to key macroeconomic trends that could drive the expected Bitcoin price resurgence. The Economic Thesis to Fuel Bitcoin Price Growth According to his latest X post, Bill Barhydt remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s direction despite the market correction. He sounded confident about this position as he compared this recent development to previous cycles. Bill noted that this pullback follows the same pattern in 2017. For context, market data pointed out that rising fiat liquidity increased asset prices. Similarly, the Abra CEO suggested President Donald Trump’s administration would likely introduce 3 key monetary policies. This includes lowering treasury rates to refinance debt, lowering mortgage rates to unlock housing and credit markets, and lowering the treasury to save banks from mass insolvency. He added that China’s economic struggles could lead to further U.S. rate cuts, which may reinforce global liquidity flows. Barhydt states these factors likely fuel a strong BTC price recovery. Some models predict Bitcoin could reach as high as $713,000 in the next six months if market conditions align. Crypto Market Outlook Due to the fragile digital asset economy, the market has seen terrific crypto liquidations in recent times. The Bitcoin price decline has triggered widespread sell-offs, with major institutional holders facing substantial losses. Notably, Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which holds the largest share of Bitcoin in circulation, has seen the value of its holdings drop. Per reports, it dropped from $21.2 billion to approximately $17.3 billion. Yet, the Abra CEO is encouraging the market not to be distressed. Bill added that this correction differs from previous market cycles, where Bitcoin has gained more value after similar downturns. For him, if history teaches anything, as liquidity increases and investor confidence stabilizes, the crypto market will soon recover. Policy and Regulatory Shifts It is important to state that regulatory and policy changes in the U.S. could also play a crucial role in Bitcoin’s next major move. For example, President Donald Trump’s executive order introduced a strategic Bitcoin reserve , utilizing seized digital assets. Likewise, the recent friendliness of the US security agency, featuring the dismissal of the Kraken lawsuit and other crypto firms, teases a clearer crypto framework could be in play. However, while Bitcoin price faces short-term volatility, the convergence of economic stimulus, historical market resilience, and evolving regulatory frameworks suggests the potential for a strong recovery. Analysts believe that if liquidity trends hold and institutional investments continue, Bitcoin could soon re-enter a bullish phase.

The recent decline has pushed the leading cryptocurrency below the 200-day moving average (MA), raising concerns about a potential deeper pullback. Bitcoin Must Defend This Key Price Level According to an X post by seasoned crypto analyst Ali Martinez, BTC is now trading below the 200-day MA, a key price level that has historically functioned as a strong support for the top digital asset. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sellers Incur Loss As SOPR Drops To 0.95 – A Sign Of Market Bottom? For the uninitiated, the 200-day MA is a famous technical indicator that essentially represents the average closing price of BTC over the last 200 days to identify the long-term price trend. Historically, a sustained movement above the 200-day MA has led to long-term uptrends while a prolonged price movement below the level has often preceded further declines. Martinez stressed that BTC must remain above the TD Sequential indicator’s risk line at $79,280. He added that a sustained move above this level could set the stage for a strong rebound to the upside. The potential for a BTC recovery was echoed by fellow crypto analyst Ted. In a post on X, he pointed out that over the past two years, BTC has frequently undergone 25% to 30% corrections before rebounding to new all-time highs (ATHs). Ted noted: In 2023, BTC went from $30K to $22K. In 2024, BTC went from $74K to $50K. This year, BTC has dumped from $109K to $79K. We all know what happened after the last 2 major corrections. If BTC follows a similar pattern and climbs 30% from its current price, it could reach approximately $104,000 in a short period. However, broader macroeconomic factors – such as US President Donald Trump’s trade tariffs and the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) monetary policy – could significantly impact BTC’s trajectory. BTC Needs To Reclaim $84,000 First In another post on X, Martinez outlined BTC’s potential path to a new ATH, emphasizing that BTC must first reclaim $84,000 as a support level before any major upside movement. Once this milestone is secured, the digital asset could rally toward $128,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Fills CME Gap Between $78,000 and $80,000 – Is A Reversal Around The Corner? Several indicators suggest that BTC may have already found a local bottom, increasing the chances of a trend reversal. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital recently noted that BTC’s plunge to $78,258 could mark the cycle low. Additionally, the US Dollar Index (DXY) has just recorded one of its largest weekly breakdowns since 2013, a move that historically signals bullish momentum for risk-on assets like BTC. At press time, BTC trades at $80,137, down 3.5% in the past 24 hours.

Beyond the usual buzz around Bitcoin and Ethereum, discerning investors are turning their attention to a fresh lineup of altcoins that might offer outsized rewards. While the crypto scene is replete with fleeting trends, only a select few coins demonstrate the robust fundamentals, increasing adoption, and tangible applications that could lead to significant market breakthroughs. At the forefront of these promising crypto ventures is Web3Bay, accompanied by other solid contenders like Solana, XRP, Hedera, and Sui, all poised for significant attention. Web3Bay (3BAY) – Revolutionizing Market Transactions with Blockchain In an era where giants such as Amazon and eBay dominate with steep fees and centralized control, Web3Bay is carving a niche in the decentralized market landscape. This platform is engineered to offer a secure, transparent, and cost-effective trading space, granting users complete authority over their dealings and personal information. Far from the fleeting allure of meme coins, Web3Bay addresses genuine challenges by cutting out the middlemen in online transactions. The excitement from investors about Web3Bay is palpable. Its presale has successfully garnered over $1.6 million, selling over 400 million tokens, making it a standout in this year’s early-stage crypto initiatives. Its structured pricing strategy promotes gradual growth, with the current presale rate at $0.00524, a 15% increase from the previous price of $0.00456. With continuing demand, many market analysts are touting Web3Bay as potentially one of the top performers in 2025, possibly yielding returns up to 500 times for those who invest early. Solana (SOL) – Pioneering Speed and Efficiency in Blockchain Technology Solana continues to assert its dominance in the blockchain arena with its incredibly fast transactions and minimal fees. It ranks as a leading Layer-1 network, drawing interest from NFT creators, DeFi communities, and large-scale investors in search of a scalable blockchain foundation. With the market buzzing, Solana is on the brink of what could be a significant upswing, with market experts eyeing the $200 mark as a critical threshold. As more developers gravitate towards Solana’s platform, the investment community is poised for potentially record-setting gains in SOL. XRP (XRP) – Expanding Reach in the Financial Sector The appeal of XRP grows as more institutional players delve into this digital asset. Brazil’s recent approval of the first spot ETF for XRP has sparked conversations about possible U.S. approval, revitalizing interest in the currency. With XRP’s price still below its historic peaks, investors see a prime opportunity for substantial returns in the forthcoming market upswing. As Bitcoin’s ascent continues, market forecasters suggest XRP could achieve new heights, positioning it as a top altcoin to invest in for substantial, long-term rewards. Hedera (HBAR) – Securing the Future with Advanced Blockchain Solutions Hedera distinguishes itself with its hashgraph consensus mechanism, enhancing speed, security, and efficiency beyond traditional blockchain systems. This technology has garnered the attention of global giants like Google, IBM, and Boeing, who are integrating Hedera’s solutions for high-level applications. As Hedera expands its footprint in DeFi and tokenization, it’s increasingly viewed as one of the market’s top altcoins to invest in due to its underestimated potential. With its continued adoption and strategic alliances, market analysts recommend HBAR as a pivotal addition to any forward-thinking crypto investment portfolio. Sui (SUI) – Redefining Scalability in Blockchain Platforms Sui is making waves in the realm of smart contracts by offering a platform that is both efficient and scalable for developers. Setting itself apart from Ethereum and Solana, Sui avoids the common pitfall of network congestion by implementing parallel transaction processing, which enhances its scalability. Despite some volatility in its price, the Sui ecosystem is on an upward trajectory with a continuous influx of new projects and DeFi applications. As adoption keeps increasing, Sui is poised to be a top altcoin to invest in and one of the standout Layer-1 networks in 2025, making it a valuable asset for any diversified crypto investment strategy. Final Insights – Spotlight on Web3Bay’s Potential While Solana, XRP, Hedera, and Sui each present considerable investment opportunities, Web3Bay stands out as the front-runner for 2025. Its decentralized approach to e-commerce, coupled with a booming presale and growing market acceptance, sets the stage for potential monumental growth in the near future. For investors aiming to capitalize on their investments, Web3Bay should be considered before its next anticipated price surge. This presents a unique chance to get involved early in one of the most rapidly expanding crypto presales. Are you prepared to claim your stake in what could be the most lucrative phase of this top altcoin to invest in? Don’t miss your chance to be part of this exciting growth journey.

It is true that Cramer said there are situations where getting away from the market makes sense, but when he was advising about getting out at the Haines Bottom, he said he said it in the context of investors taking their money in the next five years. He acknowledged that the market went down significantly from when he first issued the warning but emphasized that those who began buying near the market bottom had strong returns over time. The recent market maelstrom has been fed by a mix of forces—from concerns over rising inflation to Federal Reserve interest rate policy to geopolitical anxiety. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq have been hit hard in recent weeks, with technology stocks suffering particularly sharply. Investors are also considering hesitation over earnings reports and fears of a global economic slowdown. As crazy as it gets, Cramer still swears by his long-term belief that long-term investors should own high-quality stocks while not panic-selling every time the market goes south. He highlighted historical comebacks following prior sell-offs, such as the COVID-19 market crash of 2020, when markets rebounded sharply after reaching the bottom. Cramer highlights buying opportunities in the tech and defensive sectors Shares of mega-cap tech names such as Apple, Microsoft, and Meta — and have all recently been sold off — “still have good fundamentals,” Cramer said, and “might represent the kind of buying opportunity you’ll want long-term.” He also emphasized defensive sectors that tend to do well in turbulent economic times, like healthcare, consumer staples, and energy. Cramer noted that people should invest in the stock of quality companies to benefit more significantly over a longer period of time. He noted that the vast majority of gains in the market happen on just several key days each year. He warned investors against trying to time the market, as missing those key recovery days can have a big impact on long-term returns. Ending market declines follow a historical pattern in which markets eventually recover from downturns. The Haines Bottom of 2009 is an excellent example of how investor psychology can change at the drop of a hat, giving rise to large gains for those who remained invested. “Think of it like this: days like today are what kept you out of the big gains in the same stocks. Most people never get back,” he said. “They don’t buy, they forget, or they think that they can’t tempt fate or the market’s too brutal.” Jonny Cramer Cramer’s message when he said it: While the market sell-off now is troubling, history teaches that continuing to invest in strong companies pays off over time.

Or watched Shiba Inu skyrocket while you sat on the sidelines? If you’ve been waiting for the next big short-term crypto play, now’s your chance to act. The meme coin market is booming, and some projects are showing signs of serious growth. Right now, BTFD Coin ($BTFD) is the talk of the town with its highly rewarding referral program and presale momentum. With over $6.28 million already raised, this presale is closing fast, and early investors are locking in their spots before the price jumps. Alongside BTFD, Dogwifhat ($WIF), Floki Inu ($FLOKI), and Brett ($BRETT) are also gaining traction in the crypto space. If you’re looking for the best cryptos to buy for short term , these four deserve a closer look. BTFD Coin: The Referral Program That’s Rewarding Early Investors Big Time BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme token—it’s building a movement while giving investors multiple ways to earn. One of its most exciting features is its referral program, which allows holders to earn free $BTFD tokens by spreading the word. Here’s how it works: For every person who uses your referral code to buy $50+ in BTFD, they get an extra 10% bonus in tokens. You, as the referrer, earn 10% of their purchase amount in BTFD coins at the end of the month if you rank in the top 20 referrers. The leaderboard resets on the 1st of each month, meaning new investors always have a shot at earning big rewards. Now, let’s talk about the presale. BTFD Coin is currently in Stage 14, priced at $0.00016 per token. With over 71 billion tokens sold and 11,300+ holders, momentum is building fast. And here’s the kicker—analysts predict a $0.0006 listing price, meaning early investors could see a 3.75X return at launch. But what happens if BTFD Coin reaches its predicted moon price of $0.006? A $9,000 investment today at $0.00016 would give you 56.25 million BTFD tokens. If the price climbs to $0.0006 at launch, that investment could be worth $33,750. And if it skyrockets to $0.006, you’d be sitting on a massive $337,500. Why did this coin make it to this list? BTFD Coin’s referral program, booming presale, and insane upside potential make it one of the best cryptos to buy for short term gains. How to Buy BTFD Coins? To grab BTFD before the presale closes, set up MetaMask or Trust Wallet, load it with BNB or ETH, and visit the BTFD presale page to purchase. The earlier you buy, the more tokens you secure at this low price. Dogwifhat: The Solana Meme Coin That’s Dominating the Charts Dogwifhat ($WIF) started as a meme, but quickly became a Solana powerhouse. This coin has gained massive community support, fueled by its simple yet catchy branding. WIF is a pure meme coin, but its strong trading volume and hype cycle have kept it in the spotlight. Since launching, WIF has consistently ranked among the top Solana-based meme coins, proving that meme culture and community backing are enough to push a project forward. It has no roadmap or utility, but that hasn’t stopped traders from betting big on its short-term potential. Why did this coin make it to this list? Dogwifhat’s rapid rise, massive trading volume, and Solana’s ecosystem growth make it a solid choice for short-term gains. Floki Inu: The Utility-Packed Meme Coin With DeFi Potential Floki Inu ($FLOKI) isn’t just a meme—it’s a full-fledged ecosystem. Launched by Shiba Inu community members, FLOKI has carved out its niche by integrating DeFi, NFTs, and metaverse utilities into its platform. What makes FLOKI stand out? FlokiFi – A decentralized finance (DeFi) platform for staking and earning. Valhalla Metaverse – A play-to-earn gaming experience. Massive global community, thanks to its branding and marketing campaigns. With major exchange listings and ongoing ecosystem development, FLOKI has positioned itself as more than just a meme—it’s an investment with multiple growth angles. Why did this coin make it to this list? Floki Inu combines meme power with real DeFi and metaverse utility, giving it strong short-term and long-term upside. Brett: The Meme Coin That’s Taking Over Base Chain Brett ($BRETT) has quickly become the mascot of Base Chain, the Layer 2 blockchain developed by Coinbase. Inspired by Matt Furie’s Boys’ Club comics, Brett has gained cult-like community support, leading to explosive price action. What makes Brett interesting is that it’s heavily tied to Base Chain’s success. With Coinbase backing Base and meme coin traders flocking to the chain, BRETT has positioned itself as the leading meme project in that ecosystem. The fixed supply of 10 billion tokens also adds a deflationary aspect, making each token more valuable as demand increases. Why did this coin make it to this list? Brett’s cultural relevance, strong community backing, and connection to Base Chain make it a potential short-term moonshot. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, these are the best cryptos to buy for short term if you’re looking for quick, high-potential gains. Dogwifhat is thriving in the Solana ecosystem, Floki Inu is expanding its DeFi and metaverse reach, and Brett is becoming the face of Base Chain. But if you’re looking for a short-term play with immediate rewards, BTFD Coin is the one to watch. With its 10% referral rewards, booming presale, and strong post-launch predictions, it offers multiple ways to earn fast. The presale won’t last forever—Stage 14 is almost sold out, and once the next stage kicks in, the price will go up. If you want to secure BTFD at $0.00016 before the next price increase, now is the time to act. Join the BTFD Coin presale now before it’s too late. FAQs What makes BTFD Coin different from other meme coins? BTFD Coin has a highly rewarding referral program, a live P2E game, and 90% APY staking rewards, making it one of the best cryptos to buy for short term gains. How does the BTFD referral program work? Users earn 10% in free BTFD tokens when they refer buyers, and if they rank in the top 20 referrers, they get an additional bonus at the end of the month. Is Dogwifhat a good short-term investment? Dogwifhat has seen massive growth in the Solana ecosystem, and with strong trading volume, it remains a popular meme coin for short-term trading.

This Altcoin Is Ready To Surpass DOGE in 2025,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/missed-dogecoin-doge-back-in-the-day-this-altcoin-is-ready-to-surpass-doge-in-2025/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) valued at $0.04 when Elon Musk launched his viral tweet expanded to reach a maximum of $0.074 during 2021. The downturn of DOGE value since its high mark of $0.7376 leads the market toward a new emerging token built for continuous growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has succeeded as a decentralized lending protocol to attract investors who did not participate in the Dogecoin rally. Mutuum Finance awaits buyers at $0.015 during Phase 2 of its presale. The project has gained over $2.7 million from about 4,900 investors. The strong 85% completion rate of Phase 2 gives analysts confidence that MUTM will surpass meme coins including DOGE by 2025 because it has real-world application and systematic tokenomics. The second phase of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale maintains strong momentum The popularity of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) does not stem from viral trends. The presale process of MUTM depends on decentralized lending which unites overcollateralized loans along with peer-to-peer negotiations and revenue-sharing components. The presale’s second phase starts at $0.015 while promising early buyers a 33% profit when Phase 3 launches at $0.02. The exchange listing price of the token stands at $0.06 after its presale process which initiates at $0.015 but eventually reaches $0.06. This valuation brings 300% growth according to current market rates. The current value of $1,000 investment stands to become $4,000 during Phase 3 launch. MUTM anticipates rapid price appreciation to between $3.50 and $5 during the next few months as more users join the platform based on post-listing expert estimates. The mtTokens system embedded within the protocol enhances its offer to users. People who deposit ETH or DAI into the protocol can receive interest-bearing mtETH or mtDAI tokens that retain transferability throughout all DeFi platforms. The system offers dual functionality for earning passive income while still maintaining liquidity in ways that differ fundamentally from how Dogecoin works since it depends on social media trends. MUTM investors receive dividends from platform fees since a part of these fees automatically purchases MUTM tokens which are distributed to stakers thus reducing the risk of sell-offs. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Ecosystem Incentivizes Long-Term Holding Mutuum Finance (MUTM establishes mechanisms which prevent the problems associated with short-term speculation activities. MUTM embraces community engagement by giving its first ten participants $10,000 each from its $100,000 presale giveaway funds yet it avoids excessive token promotion. Secured overcollateralized lending on MUTM registers as a feature which attracts lenders who prioritize protection against defaults. The P2P system through MUTM allows borrowers to access loans with terms that offer the option for DOGE and SHIB transactions which standard pools normally do not support. MUTM’s growth path will be strengthened by the implementation of Tokenomics. Following presale distribution the released supply will remain at 20% which creates scarcity throughout the market. Surging prices are predicted due to both scarce token economics and the buy-and-distribute model. Buyers who purchased MUTM tokens during presale at $0.015 might earn substantial gains of up to 23,233% if the project reaches $3.50 within the market because analysts predict such high potential based on revenue-based token burns and rising user numbers. Time is critical. The fast speed at which Phase 2 fills funds demonstrates the same sense of emergency that led Phase 1 to sell out in a few days. The period to acquire MUTM at presale rates before exchange listings becomes shorter by the day. Investors who passed up on DOGE during its historic rise are turning their attention to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) because they understand its combination of DeFi development and massive financial returns. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently duplicating Dogecoin’s initial market gains after eliminating its usual price fluctuations in the crypto market. MUTM possesses the potential to outperform DOGE as well as reinvent DeFi investment criteria through its operational framework combined with its visible token distribution structure alongside continuous buy-driven market activity. Purchase your tokens now since Phase 3 will launch another price increase in the market.

The order is expected to address regulatory policies that limited crypto companies’ access to banking services, according to sources familiar with the matter. Donald Trump Executive Order on Crypto Banking Barriers The upcoming Donald Trump executive order is expected to roll back rules linked to “Operation Chokepoint 2.0,” a term used to describe efforts that allegedly pressured banks to deny services to crypto-related businesses. The initiative, widely discussed by industry leaders, suggested that the previous administration discouraged financial institutions from working with the crypto sector. White House officials confirmed that steps are being taken to remove these restrictions. Bo Hines, Executive Director of the Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets, stated, “I think that the industry can expect something in short order there.” However, specific details regarding the content of the executive order have not yet been disclosed. Potential Changes to Federal Reserve Policies The Donald Trump executive order may also target Federal Reserve policies that restricted crypto-focused banks from obtaining master accounts. These accounts allow banks to transact directly with the Federal Reserve and are essential for operating nationwide. During the Biden administration, banks like Custodia were denied master accounts, limiting their ability to offer financial services to crypto firms. Despite increasing calls for change, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) have not yet rescinded any anti-crypto guidance. Last month, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged concerns over crypto debanking , stating that he was “struck” by the growing number of cases and that the Fed would take a “fresh look” at the issue. Custodia Bank CEO Caitlin Long has criticized the Fed and FDIC for their approach to crypto banking, stating that they were “far more detrimental to crypto banking” than the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), which recently rescinded its restrictive crypto banking guidance. Elizabeth Warren Signals Support for Crypto Banking Access Senator Elizabeth Warren, has also expressed a willingness to work with the Trump administration to address debanking issues. During a recent Senate Banking Committee hearing, Warren stated, “Debanking is a real problem. This shouldn’t be happening, and we need to fix it.” Her position represents a shift in her approach to cryptocurrency regulation. While she has previously advocated for stricter oversight, Warren now appears to support ensuring that banks do not deny services to crypto firms without clear justification. Trump’s Continued Focus on Cryptocurrency Policy This Donald Trump executive order would be the third related to cryptocurrency since Trump returned to office. The first order, signed in January, established the Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets. The second, signed last week, directed the creation of a U.S. government strategic Bitcoin reserve and a separate digital asset stockpile. Reports suggest that the upcoming order may include provisions related to stablecoins, stating that they should not be classified as securities. If signed, this order could introduce major regulatory changes affecting the cryptocurrency industry, particularly in the banking sector. A senior White House official stated that legal considerations are being reviewed before the order is finalized. While no specific date has been confirmed, sources suggest the signing could take place within the week.

Higher yields are said to signal market optimism traditionally, but Japan’s current economic situation on the ground has everyday residents worried about a massive downturn. Japan 10-year government bond yields hit a peak not seen since the 2008 economic downturn on Monday, as big investors signaled confidence in the market, expecting further interest rate hikes from the Bank of Japan (BoJ) and greater stabilization. The BoJ previously raised the benchmark rate by 25 basis points in January, to the current level of 0.5% — a level not seen in 17 years. The bond yield rate tapped a high of 1.591% at 3:40 p.m. (JST). Typically, investors flee to perceived low-risk assets like government bonds in times of economic uncertainty, or when inflation — and its subsequent remedial rate hikes — is expected. As the short-term, central bank-dictated interest rate rises, however, holders of older bonds with lower yield rates locked in have a hard time selling them, as market actors can now enter and buy new bonds with a higher yield, resulting in prices for these securities being forced downward. Japan’s benchmark yield rate for 10-year government bonds hit its highest levels since 2008 on Monday. Source: MarketWatch. Further, markets being flooded with money can coincide with increasing yields. This is likely what happened back in 2008 , after the U.S. government intervened to bail out the banking industry. Investor confidence in riskier assets returned, money exited back into the wider market, and bond prices fell as their yields inversely climbed, incentivizing investment back into these long-term securities. What the rising bond rate means for Japan While Japan’s 10-year government bond yield rate has cooled slightly at the time of writing, some market watchers, like CEO of SBI Global Asset Management Tomoya Asakura, say the rate could reach levels as high as 2%. Asakura noted on social media platform X (translated): “The 10-year yen bond yield has reached a level not seen since the Lehman Shock, with a 2.0% yield in sight.” He continued by stating that “The market is not yet prepared for this impact.” Asakura fears the impact of “rising borrowing costs” for businesses and consumers, as well as the effects of a stronger yen on export companies. Further, the CEO predicts an increase in the interest payment burden on the BoJ for yen bonds held by the institution. Asakura’s post on X. More fiscally conservative voices view the tightening as a positive signal, while on the ground, everyday residents of the archipelago continue to suffer under both hawkish and dovish policies, regardless. Whether by way of a stronger JPY and attendant higher borrowing costs, or a weaker yen and continued out-of-control inflation, it looks like things will invariably get harder for low-wage earners. If Asakura’s warnings come true, the result could even be a 2008-style market collapse. Trading Economics detailed the bond yield surge, reporting on data from January: “Inflation-adjusted real wages—a key measure of consumer purchasing power—fell 1.8% year-on-year, marking the first decline in three months.” Notably, Japan is also facing a challenging influx of tourists , incentivized by state-sponsored benefits such as free domestic air travel, making it harder for locals to live economically viable lives even in their own communities.

The order is expected to target policies under “Operation Chokepoint 2.0,” which seeks to roll back these restrictions and support the crypto industry. Bo Hines, Executive Director of the White House’s Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets, confirmed that administrative action is coming but didn’t provide details. He mentioned that the industry can expect something soon. Hines also emphasized that the Trump administration aims to end practices linked to “Operation Chokepoint 2.0,” a term coined by Nic Carter, which refers to efforts similar to the Obama-era Operation Choke Point that targeted payday lenders and gun dealers. Trump’s Executive Order Could Open Fed Access to Crypto Banks While details of Trump’s executive order are still being finalized, it could impact Federal Reserve policies on master accounts. These accounts, held by federally chartered banks, are essential for making direct payments and accessing the Fed’s services. Under the Biden administration, the Fed denied master accounts to crypto-focused banks like Custodia, hindering their growth. Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett remarked that this is significant because the Federal Reserve and the FDIC have not yet reversed any anti-crypto policies, even though Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell mentioned last month that he was concerned by the increasing number of crypto debanking cases and that the Fed would “take a fresh look” at the issue. https://twitter.com/EleanorTerrett/status/1899213132272447631 Trump Administration Pushes Forward Despite Challenges While the Federal Reserve operates independently from the White House, the Trump administration is pushing forward with its crypto order, despite potential legal hurdles. Sources note that senior White House officials are set to meet Thursday to assess possible challenges before putting the order on Trump’s desk. However, a White House official denied any such meeting is scheduled but confirmed that efforts to roll back Operation Chokepoint 2.0 are already in motion. The race to reshape crypto policy is heating up, and all eyes are on what comes next. Directive on Stablecoins? The upcoming executive order could extend beyond banking, and might include a directive stating that stablecoins, which are designed to maintain a stable value and are typically pegged to the U.S. dollar, should not be classified as securities. If Trump signs this order, it would be his third crypto-related executive action since returning to office. The first, signed on January 23, created a Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets. The second, signed last week, ordered the establishment of a U.S. government Bitcoin reserve and a separate stockpile for other digital assets. Bitcoin Dips Despite The Developments Trump’s recent Crypto Summit disappointed industry leaders, with his Bitcoin reserve plan failing to boost the market as the administration plans to use seized assets. Broader economic policies, including tariffs on China and others, have also shaken markets. As a result, institutional investors pulled funds from Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, causing Bitcoin to fall below $80,000 for the first time in 4 months and Ethereum to drop to $1,870.",News|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,FIAT|REGULATION|BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS|ETH,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-11 02:19:47

That’s a 30% decline from its all-time high of $110,000, and the sell-off isn’t just hitting crypto—stocks are also in freefall. But according to Arthur Hayes, traders need to wait it out. “The plan: Be fucking patient,” Hayes said in a post on X. He predicted Bitcoin would likely bottom at $70,000, which would be a 36% correction from its peak—something he called “very normal for a bull market.” But he made it clear that crypto isn’t bouncing back on its own. Hayes said the next steps were for stocks to crash, a major traditional finance institution to go under, and central banks to start printing money again before things turn around. “Then you load up the truck,” he said . BTC price chart. Source: Jai Hamid/TradingView Hayes also said, in a separate post, that: “BTC trades 24/7, anyone globally with internet can trade, it cannot be printed, failure results in bankruptcy or liquidation. No country’s finances are tied to BTC going up in price. Stocks trade 8/5, only certain people can trade them, they cannot be printed, failure if you are politically connected results in a bailout. Marginal tax receipts in Pax Americana are directly tied to the stock market. It will get a bailout, it just depends on whether your portfolio is still alive when it occurs.” Stock market tanks while Bitcoin slides This crash isn’t just a Bitcoin problem. The Nasdaq 100 dropped 1,050 points in a single day, a 5.8% loss, and after-hours trading saw another 300-point drop. If the market had stayed open, it would have been just 1.2% away from a circuit breaker halt, something that only happens when things are in full panic mode. Futures trading isn’t looking any better. S&P 500 futures slipped 0.4%, Nasdaq-100 futures fell 0.9%, and Dow Jones futures dropped slightly, down 20 points. But Delta Air Lines took the biggest hit, plunging 11% after-hours after slashing its profit and sales forecast due to weak U.S. travel demand. SPX S&P 500 Index chart. Source: TradingView Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has now logged three consecutive losing weeks, with Monday’s session adding to the pain. The Dow Jones lost nearly 900 points, falling below its 200-day moving average for the first time since November 1, 2023. The Nasdaq Composite had its worst day since September 2022. “This is starting to feel like a capitulation in the market,” said Anastasia Amoroso, chief investment strategist at iCapital, on CNBC’s Closing Bell. She said markets were reaching oversold levels, predicting that things would either hit rock bottom immediately or sometime this week. Peter Schiff slams Bitcoin, investors wait for economic data Peter Schiff, known for his anti-Bitcoin stance, wasted no time in trashing crypto after the latest drop. “Now that Bitcoin fell below $77K, it’s down 30% from its January record high,” Schiff wrote on X. He questioned how the U.S. government could consider Bitcoin as a reserve asset when it can lose value so quickly. “The rationale will be even harder to see when it’s down 50%,” he added. Schiff then tied the crash to U.S. manufacturing, saying that with crypto millionaires losing money, the country would need to bring back industrial jobs. Investors are now bracing for key economic reports this week. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) comes out on Tuesday, followed by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Wednesday and the Producer Price Index (PPI) on Thursday. These reports could decide whether inflation fears will push the Federal Reserve toward more aggressive rate cuts. Market volume also spiked during Monday’s trading session. More than 82% of stocks on the Nasdaq ended the day in the red, while 76% of New York Stock Exchange stocks also dropped. Declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones 4 to 1, and new 52-week lows on the Nasdaq hit 413, compared to just 69 new highs. Meanwhile, crypto-related stocks collapsed. Coinbase dropped 17.6%, Robinhood fell 19.8%, and MicroStrategy, now rebranded as Strategy, saw its stock price tank by 16%. Bitcoin ETFs see outflows, Trump comments on recession The Bitcoin ETF market has also taken a beating. Outflows totaled $867 million last week, making it the fourth straight week of withdrawals, according to CoinShares. That brings the total four-week outflows to $4.75 billion, as bearish sentiment continues to push prices down. The broader crypto market took another hit over the weekend, with Bitcoin briefly dropping to $80,000 for the first time since February 28th. Adding to the uncertainty, Donald Trump weighed in on the economy during a Fox News interview, calling it a “period of transition.” His comments followed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s statement that the U.S. could go through a “detox period” as the administration cuts federal spending. Source: Farside Goldman Sachs has also revised its economic growth forecast downward, citing concerns over Trump’s tariff policies. But despite all the chaos, Amoroso dismissed recession fears, pointing to strong payroll reports and steady consumer spending at 3-4%. Meanwhile, the White House is downplaying the weeks-long stock market sell-off, insisting that recent moves by business leaders suggest a brighter outlook for the U.S. economy. “We’re seeing a strong divergence between animal spirits of the stock market and what we’re actually seeing unfold from businesses and business leaders,” the White House told reporters Monday afternoon. “The latter is obviously more meaningful than the former on what’s in store for the economy in the medium to long term,” said the White House. Still, the combination of a weak stock market, crypto outflows, and uncertainty in macroeconomics has traders on edge. Many are waiting for central banks to step in, just like Hayes predicted. The Federal Reserve, the PBOC, the ECB, and the BOJ could all be forced to ease policies to support their economies. For now, though, the message from Hayes is clear: Wait.

Senate Passes Bill, But Makes Key Amendment",https://bitcoinist.com/utahs-bitcoin-strategic-reserve-race-over-senate-passes-bill-but-makes-key-amendment/,"Utah’s State Senate has exited the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) race after amending the proposed bill allowing the state treasury to invest in digital assets. The amended legislation is now headed to Utah Governor Spencer Cox’s desk to be signed into law. Utah Passes Bitcoin Bill Without Key Clause On March 7, Utah’s senate passed House Bill 230 (HB230), also known as the “Blockchain and Digital Innovation Amendments.” However, the state lawmakers amended the legislation to scrap the clause allowing the state to invest in digital assets. The legislation initially authorized the state treasurer to invest up to 5% of certain public reserve funds in “qualifying digital assets” and established requirements for their custody and management. To be considered for investment, a digital asset must have maintained a market capitalization of more than $500 billion over the past 12 months and not be a stablecoin. Bitcoin was the only cryptocurrency that met these requirements. Utah Representative Jordan Teuscher introduced HB230 on January 21 and passed the House of Representatives vote 8-1 before proceeding to the Senate’s first reading. The bill passed the Senate Revenue and Taxation Committee reading on February 20 in a 4-2-1 vote and moved to the second and third reading in the full Senate. After passing the second reading, the Senate dropped the Reserve clause on its third reading over “a lot of concern with those provisions and the early adoption of these types of policies,” stated Senator Kirk A. Cullimore on the March 7 floor session. Without the Bitcoin reserve clause, the bill only establishes basic custody protections for Utahns. It also provides the right to mine Bitcoin, run a node, develop software, and participate in staking without regulatory overreach. According to Bitcoin Laws , “This bill establishes a comprehensive framework for digital asset regulation and blockchain technology in Utah, providing clear definitions and protections for individuals and businesses engaging with digital assets. (…) It prohibits state and local governmental entities from restricting a person’s ability to accept digital assets as payment or use self-hosted or hardware wallets.” The bill is now headed to Utah Governor Spencer Cox’s desk to be signed into law after passing the Senate with a 19-7-3 vote. US Strategic BTC Reserve Race Continues Despite Utah’s Bitcoin Reserve outcome, other US states remain in the race to become the first state to establish an SBR. Bitcoin Laws data shows Arizona has two BTC reserve bills awaiting a final floor vote in the Senate. Similarly, the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve legislation, introduced in January, passed the Senate committee at the end of February and awaits its final vote. New Hampshire and Oklahoma have also advanced their proposals for an SBR at a state level. Meanwhile, bills from Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, and other states remain live but are at the early stages of the legislative process. It’s worth noting that US President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order to officially establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a “Digital Asset Stockpile.” Last Thursday, White House AI & Crypto Czar David Sacks announced that the reserve will be “capitalized with Bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings.” The executive order followed President Trump’s Mach 2 announcement of a “US Crypto Reserve” to elevate the industry “after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden Administration.”",Crypto News|bitcoin|Bitcoin reserve|btc|BTCUSDT|Crypto legislation|Donald Trump|HB230|Strategic Bitcoin Rerseve|US Bitcoin Reserve|US President|Utah strategic Bitcoin reserve,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|RUNE|FDUSD,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-03-11 02:30:18

Since hitting that level, the cryptocurrency has steadily declined, now trading below $80,000 as of today. While the short-term price action suggests a bearish outlook, some analysts remain confident about Bitcoin’s potential for long-term growth. Bitcoin’s Price Outlook: $180K Within Reach? One of CryptoQuant’s contributors to the QuickTake platform, ibrahimcosar, recently shared his perspective on Bitcoin’s price trajectory, offering a bold prediction for its next all-time high (ATH). In his latest analysis, the analyst reiterated his long-term expectation that Bitcoin could reach $180,000 by 2026, citing historical price cycles and institutional projections that align with his forecast. According to Ibrahim, Bitcoin’s price movements over the past year have followed a familiar pattern seen in previous bull cycles. The analyst pointed out that major financial institutions have recently begun making similar long-term projections, validating his earlier forecasts. While Bitcoin currently trades below $80,000, he believes that the asset has the potential to more than double in value within the next two years. If Bitcoin follows historical patterns, the $150K–$200K range could be achieved in the upcoming bull cycle. The analyst emphasized that investors who enter the market at current levels could see over 100% returns, provided Bitcoin reaches its predicted target by 2026. However, he also noted that timing the market correctly is crucial, as buying at key support levels has historically presented the most favorable opportunities for long-term gains. Ibrahim wrote: In summary, those investing in Bitcoin at these levels have the potential to gain over 100% in dollar terms without even waiting a year. Buying in the right regions and at the right times can present significant opportunities. Short-Term Market Trends and Buying Opportunities While long-term projections remain bullish, Bitcoin’s short-term price action continues to fluctuate. Another CryptoQuant analyst, BilalHuseynov, provided insights into open interest (OI) trends, which may indicate whether this is a favorable time to buy Bitcoin. According to BilalHuseynov, the 7-day change in open interest has entered a “deleveraging” phase, a signal that has historically aligned with potential buying opportunities. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Rally Above ATH To $128K – On-Chain Indicator Signals Potential Recovery The last time this occurred was in August 2024, when Bitcoin was trading between $58,000 and $60,000 before rallying to an all-time high of $106K. If historical trends repeat, the current market conditions could set the stage for a similar recovery. The CryptoQuant analyst noted: When the OI ratio’s change for 7 days down to the section, that means we can define the time to buy. Since August 2024, we have been observing one of the deepest areas in the Crypto Market. To remember, at this time (2024 Aug), Bitcoin’s price was around 58 – 60k. After that, the price goes up to ~106k.

In the world of cryptocurrency, timing is everything, and those who get in early often see the biggest gains. Right now, three cryptocurrencies are making waves, and one in particular is capturing investors’ attention like never before. While Arctic Pablo Coin (APC ) continues to gain momentum, TURBO and Official TRUMP Coin are also making headlines with major developments. TURBO is gearing up for potential ecosystem expansions, and Official TRUMP Coin is seeing renewed interest due to political influences. This article will cover the latest updates on all three projects: Arctic Pablo Coin, TURBO, and Official TRUMP Coin. Earn Big with Arctic Pablo Coin’s APY, Referral Incentives & Community Rewards One of the standout features of Arctic Pablo Coin is its lucrative staking mechanism. With an astonishing 66% APY during the presale, investors can stake their APC tokens and earn substantial rewards, making it one of the most attractive passive income opportunities in the crypto space. Unlike traditional investments, where returns are slow, Arctic Pablo Coin ensures that early adopters benefit from its dynamic growth. Beyond staking, APC also rewards its community through an exciting referral incentive program. By simply sharing the project with others, participants can earn additional tokens, making it a win-win situation. Moreover, the project fosters engagement through community competitions, where participants can secure even more APC tokens or USD-based rewards. These competitive elements drive engagement and reinforce Arctic Pablo Coin’s status as one of the top new meme coins to invest in now. Arctic Pablo Coin Presale Reaches Frosty Falls – Don’t Miss the $0.000074 Entry Price! Arctic Pablo Coin has now entered Frosty Falls, marking the 14th phase of its unique presale journey. Unlike traditional stage-based sales, APC’s presale follows an adventurous narrative, exploring different locations as the project evolves. Investors who joined earlier have already witnessed rapid progression through the previous 13 locations, each selling out faster than anticipated. Currently, APC is priced at just $0.000074, and the project has already raised over $1.85 million. This means that from the current price to the listing value of $0.008, the potential ROI exceeds 10,713.51%. With each new location, the price increases, and given the momentum Arctic Pablo Coin has gained, Frosty Falls could sell out at any moment. This is the last chance to enter at this ultra-low price before the next increase! TURBO Prepares for Major Ecosystem Expansion – What’s Next? TURBO, one of the most innovative meme coins, is making headlines with its potential ecosystem expansion. Recent updates indicate that the team is exploring DeFi integrations, which could significantly boost its utility. Additionally, there are talks about partnerships with leading NFT projects, further strengthening its use case within the crypto space. With growing investor interest and ongoing developments, TURBO continues to be a key player in the meme coin sector. Official TRUMP Coin Gains Momentum Amid Political Buzz Official TRUMP Coin has seen a surge in activity following recent political events. Market analysts are attributing the token’s increased volume to heightened discussions about potential campaign integrations. Some reports even suggest that crypto donations could play a role in upcoming elections, making Official TRUMP Coin a speculative yet exciting investment. With heightened media attention and a dedicated community, the project remains one to watch. Conclusion: Arctic Pablo Coin’s Presale Is the Ultimate Opportunity With Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale reaching Frosty Falls and its price at just $0.000074, this could be the last opportunity to secure APC at such a low entry point before the next phase kicks in. Meanwhile, TURBO’s ecosystem expansion and Official TRUMP Coin’s political surge are also drawing significant interest. However, among these contenders, Arctic Pablo Coin’s unmatched ROI potential and lucrative staking rewards make it one of the top new meme coin presales to invest in now.

This activity suggests renewed interest from institutional and high-net-worth investors, indicating confidence in the long-term trajectory of the Cardano price. Such accumulation phases have historically been linked to price stabilization and upward momentum. Whale Accumulation Signals Confidence In Cardano According to data from Santiment, wallets holding between 1,000,000 and 10,000,000 ADA have increased their holdings significantly. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted that these investors have accumulated over 180 million ADA within a short period, reflecting sustained interest despite market fluctuations. Whale accumulation is often linked to price movements, as large-scale purchases reduce circulating supply. This trend has previously preceded bullish phases in Cardano price, especially when buying pressure remains steady. Meanwhile, recent analysis shows that ADA price may rally as high as $36, aligning with the speculation fueled by the Simpsons’ prediction . Despite ADA’s current bearish trend, analysts point to key support at $0.70, growing market interest, and ETF discussions as potential catalysts for a strong recovery. Despite the strong accumulation, Cardano price has experienced fluctuations in recent weeks. Market analysts emphasize the importance of key support and resistance levels in determining whether the price will consolidate or break out into a new uptrend. Retail traders remain cautious, as past whale movements have not always resulted in immediate price gains. Analyst Eilert’s Take On Price Patterns Additionally, Crypto analyst Eilert observed that Cardano price is following a structure similar to its previous market cycle. In the last cycle, ADA retraced 52% from its high before entering an 11-week consolidation phase. This period of sideways movement allowed for accumulation before a significant breakout. Historical patterns suggest that similar price behavior has often led to strong bullish moves, especially when support levels hold. Currently, ADA has retraced 47% from its recent cycle high and is now in its fifth week of consolidation. This mirrors the past cycle, indicating that Cardano whale activity may be reinforcing a new accumulation phase. If the pattern continues, ADA could be positioned for a major price move, provided market conditions remain favorable. Source: X In the previous market cycle, the top altcoin rallied 4,000% from a similar support zone after a prolonged consolidation. While past trends do not guarantee future performance, historical data suggests that prolonged accumulation often precedes a price surge. At press time, Cardano price is trading at $0.6924, reflecting an 11.82% decline in the last 7 days. During this period, ADA dropped from a high of $0.7849, with its market cap shrinking by 7.37% to $24.39 billion.

The rising correlation between returns for bitcoin and the US stock market shows a closer relationship between the two assets in recent years. This year’s downturn for the S&P 500 appears to have been foreshadowed by bitcoin’s correction, which started earlier. By James Picerno The use case for bitcoin remains debatable, although there’s a growing focus on the cryptocurrency’s volatile price gyrations as a potential indicator of the risk appetite for the equities market and beyond. As the latest example, bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) began turning lower in mid-February while the stock market (S&P 500 Index) was at or near record highs (see chart below). This could be random behavior, but reviewing the return correlation between equities and bitcoin shows a closer relationship in recent years. The second chart below shows the rolling 1-year correlation for daily returns for the S&P and bitcoin. The linear trend since 2015 highlights a rising connection. The correlation between the two assets is currently around 0.4, which equates with a moderately positive relationship. By comparison, before 2020, the correlation remained below 0.2 and was, at times, negative. The closer link between the two assets suggests that bitcoin tends to be subject to the same risk-on and risk-off cycles as stocks. As such, to the extent that bitcoin has been a hedge for stock market risk, the efficacy of the hedge appears to be fading. At the same time, bitcoin’s wider and deeper integration into the financial ecosystem (albeit primarily as a speculative asset to date) seems to be enhancing the cryptocurrency’s price trends as an early indicator of changing risk sentiment. What’s the catalyst for bitcoin’s rising correlation with the stock market? The asset’s growing integration into the financial system is one possibility. As bitcoin has become an increasingly mainstream market (the launch of bitcoin ETFs and higher institutional allocations, for example) its short-term trends appear to have become more closely aligned with general investment flows. Although bitcoin is now more widely held and traded across the financial world’s ecosystem, one thing hasn’t changed for the asset: relatively short, dramatic trend cycles. As the third chart shows, the 6-month return history remains volatile. The extremes of a decade ago have subsided to a degree, but the hefty swings endure (at least by the standards of conventional assets). Because bitcoin remains heavily influenced by speculative investment flows, the ebb and flow of its price trends remain stark. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency’s market cap has surged and was recently estimated at roughly $1.5 trillion, which is more or less equivalent to the total market value of Meta ( META ) (Facebook). As a result, bitcoin’s price-trend shifts probably reflect a wider share of market sentiment generally. It’s open for debate how bitcoin’s role as an asset will evolve in the years ahead, but there’s a case for monitoring the price as a possible early sign of change in the market’s near-term appetite for risk.

Where do you report these things? Well, you go here, you go there, you go somewhere else,” Martin told Cointelegraph at the SXSW conference in Austin, Texas. “I’d love to see that addressed and really brought under one umbrella, and that then helps us get a better idea of the magnitude of the problem.” “That then helps drive resources from the whole federal government to do more to address some of the underlying causes, he added. The US has dozens of federal and state-level agencies that handle reports of financial and internet crimes, one of which is the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), which gives victims a way to report cybercrime. Martin said that crypto scam victims are reporting to authorities, but it “feels like they’re screaming into the void to like IC3 or some of the government reporting websites.” He added the various reporting sites should be consolidated “into a single reporting system that not only has all the data in one place but that also, in a perfect world, gives victims some visibility.” On an earlier panel regarding online fraud, in which Martin took part, retired FBI agent Roger Campbell said many victims of crypto romance scams search the internet for how to report the crime and “all kinds of information comes up.” “It’s kind of frustrating,” he said. Campbell gave the example of the UK as a country with an “awesome reporting system” where one portal is used to report all crimes, and victims can follow the status of their complaints. FBI’s Roger Campbell (center left) on a panel with Coinbase’s Philip Martin (center right). Other panelists include former Twitter safety lead Yoel Roth (right) and MSNBC reporter Mackenzie Sigalos (left). Source: Turner Wright / Cointelegraph “You report something to the IC3, you never hear anything back 99% of the time,” he added. “It gets frustrating again for the victim. They almost feel victimized again.” Related: ‘Victim-blaming’ Americans can deter crypto scams reporting — Regulator Coinbase’s Martin told Cointelegraph that scams have a “lag in reporting,” and the way that attackers carry out schemes today won’t be known for months . “A scam may have happened six months ago, and we might hear about it tomorrow,” he said. Another difficulty in policing crypto scams, according to Martin, is that they’re “by and large” conducted from outside the US in countries including Myanmar and Laos, where “it can be hard for law enforcement to reach into those areas and really sort of strangle the stuff at the root. “ He said combatting crypto scams should focus on international relations and the US, “making it a priority to work with governments around the world so that there’s no safe haven for these scammers.” Meanwhile, on March 10, the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation said it received over 2,600 complaints last year and found seven types of scams it hadn’t yet discovered, including crypto mining, gaming, jobs and giveaway scams.

The crypto world moves fast, and those who recognize the hottest opportunities early are the ones who make the biggest gains. With meme coins driving massive hype and speculation, finding the right projects at the right time is key. One of the most talked-about meme coins right now is BTFD Coin (BTFD)—a presale sensation that’s already raised $6.28 million, selling over 71 billion tokens and attracting more than 11,300 holders. With its play-to-earn (P2E) game, 90% APY staking, and a thriving Bulls Squad community, BTFD is shaping up to be one of the most exciting investments in the meme coin space. Alongside it, two other meme coins, Cat in a Dog’s World (MEW) and Mog Coin (MOG), are also making waves in the market. If you’re looking for the best new meme coins to buy today , these three could be worth your attention. Let’s break them down. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin That’s Redefining Play-to-Earn Gaming BTFD Coin is gaining serious momentum, and for good reason. It’s not just another meme coin—it’s a full-fledged ecosystem that includes a play-to-earn (P2E) game, a 90% APY staking opportunity, and a highly engaged community known as the Bulls Squad. With so many investors looking for the best new meme coins to buy today, BTFD Coin stands out as a project with actual utility and strong long-term potential. One of the biggest reasons investors are paying attention to BTFD is its fully launched P2E game, which went live on January 1, 2025. Unlike many meme coins that promise future utility, BTFD has already delivered. Players can earn $BTFD tokens by competing in various in-game challenges, making this project more than just hype—it has real engagement and adoption. With gaming and crypto colliding in a big way, P2E projects have been some of the best-performing assets in the last few years. Games like Axie Infinity and The Sandbox exploded in value when adoption surged, and BTFD is aiming to be the next big thing in the space. For investors who prefer to let their money work for them, BTFD offers a massive 90% APY staking reward—one of the highest in the meme coin market. That means if you stake your tokens, you’ll earn passive income just for holding. And let’s talk numbers. Right now, BTFD is in Stage 14 of its presale, selling at just $0.00016 per token. If the price hits its projected $0.0006 listing price, a $15,000 investment today would be worth $56,250 at launch. But here’s the real kicker—if BTFD reaches its predicted moon price of $0.006, that same investment could skyrocket to $562,500. With the presale gaining traction fast, it’s clear why BTFD Coin is one of the best new meme coins to buy today before prices rise in the next stage. How to Buy BTFD Coin Buying BTFD Coin is simple. Set up a MetaMask or Trust Wallet, load it with BNB, ETH, or USDT, and head over to the BTFD presale page . Connect your wallet, select the amount you want to invest, confirm the transaction, and once the presale ends, claim your $BTFD tokens. Why did this coin make it to this list? BTFD Coin stands out for its P2E game, high staking rewards, and incredible presale momentum. With analysts predicting a massive price jump, this project has strong fundamentals and real adoption, making it one of the best new meme coins to buy today. Cat in a Dog’s World (MEW): A Meme Coin Taking on the Dog Dominance The meme coin space has been dominated by dog-themed tokens for years, from Dogecoin to Shiba Inu and even Bonk. But MEW, the token behind Cat in a Dog’s World, is here to shake things up. Launched in March 2024, MEW has gained traction by positioning itself as the anti-dog meme coin. The project’s branding, community engagement, and Solana-based scalability have helped it attract early investors who believe in its underdog (or undercat?) potential. Its trading volume surged in April, with more investors jumping in on the joke and making serious gains. While it doesn’t have built-in staking or gaming features, its growing community-driven movement has turned heads in the crypto space. Why did this coin make it to this list? MEW made this list because it taps into the meme coin culture in a fresh way, offering an alternative to the dog-themed craze. If its community continues to grow, it could see short-term price pumps and increased market adoption. Mog Coin (MOG): The Meme Coin That’s All About Internet Culture MOG Coin is another emerging meme project that’s generating buzz in the crypto and internet meme space. Designed to celebrate internet humor, MOG has been adopted by traders looking for a lighthearted, community-focused investment. The coin has no specific utility but has managed to rally a large social media following, proving once again that meme coins can succeed purely on culture and branding. While MOG is still gaining traction, its organic growth and hype cycle suggest it could see short-term surges. Why did this coin make it to this list? MOG Coin earned its spot for its strong cultural backing and rapid growth in the meme coin space. If momentum continues, it could be a quick mover in the market. Final Thoughts Based on market trends and investor sentiment, these three meme coins are showing strong potential right now. BTFD Coin is the only project still in presale, and with its P2E game, 90% APY staking rewards, and over $6.28 million raised, it’s attracting serious attention. With Stage 14 selling fast and the price set to rise in the next stage, investors still have a limited window to buy at $0.00016 per token before the presale ends. If BTFD hits its $0.006 moon price, the ROI potential is massive. MEW and MOG Coin are also catching attention as meme-based projects with community-driven growth, proving that meme coins continue to thrive in the crypto space. If you’re looking for the best new meme coins to buy today, now is the time to get in before these tokens hit their next price milestone. Join the BTFD Coin presale now and secure your spot before the next price increase. FAQs What makes BTFD Coin different from other meme coins? BTFD Coin stands out with its play-to-earn game, 90% APY staking, and strong community engagement. Unlike other meme coins that rely only on hype, BTFD already has a functional ecosystem. How high can BTFD Coin go after launch? Analysts predict BTFD Coin could hit $0.0006 at listing, with a potential moon price of $0.006. If that happens, early investors could see 3,650% ROI. Is it too late to buy BTFD Coin? No, but time is running out. The presale is in Stage 14, and once it sells out, the price will rise. Buying now at $0.00016 locks in a lower entry price before listing.

In 2025, they’re not only thriving but also evolving into some of the most exciting and community-driven digital assets in the crypto space. Whether you’re in it for the fun, the potential for massive returns, or the thrill of viral trends, meme coins continue to capture the attention of investors worldwide. Some meme coins rely purely on community hype, while others are adding real-world use cases to their ecosystems. With a mix of established names and rising stars, picking the best new meme coins to invest in March 2025 can be a game-changer for your portfolio. One rising star that’s gaining attention is BTFD Coin , which is making waves with its innovative Referral Rewards Program, allowing investors to earn passive income while growing the community. Below, we’ve handpicked five meme coins that deserve your attention right now. 1. BTFD Coin – The Meme Coin That Rewards You for Spreading the Word In a sea of meme coins, BTFD Coin is carving out a unique niche with its Referral Rewards Program, offering investors a fresh way to grow their holdings while engaging their networks. Instead of simply relying on hype, BTFD Coin brings in an element of competition and rewards that sets it apart. Unlike most meme coins that rely solely on price speculation, BTFD Coin incentivizes user participation with a referral system that allows holders to earn passive rewards. By sharing a referral code, users can earn up to 10% of the total purchase amount of their referrals, paid out in BTFD tokens. Each month, the leaderboard resets, giving new investors a chance to compete for top referral spots. This structure keeps engagement high and fosters long-term commitment from the community—something many meme coins struggle with. The project has been gaining traction at an impressive pace. BTFD Coin is currently in its 14th presale stage, with a price of $0.00016 per token. So far, it has raised over $6.28 million, with more than 11,300 holders in the Bulls community. Over 71 billion BTFD tokens have already been sold, proving that demand is surging. As its presale continues to grow, BTFD Coin is one of the best new meme coins to invest in March 2025. 2. Dogecoin – The Legendary Meme Coin That Started It All No list of top meme coins would be complete without Dogecoin (DOGE)—the original meme token that remains a staple in the crypto market. Despite its humble beginnings as a joke, Dogecoin has cemented itself as a dominant force, surviving market crashes and thriving on strong community backing. Dogecoin continues to remain relevant because of its longevity and stability. It has outlived countless meme coins and remains one of the top cryptos by market cap. Beyond being a cultural phenomenon, Dogecoin has also gained real-world adoption. Major brands, including Tesla and AMC Theatres, now accept DOGE for payments. Grayscale has even launched a Dogecoin Trust, allowing institutional investors to gain exposure to the coin. Unlike newer meme coins, Dogecoin has already proven itself through multiple crypto market cycles. For investors seeking a more established meme coin, Dogecoin remains one of the best new meme coins to invest in March 2025. 3. Bonk – The Solana-Based Underdog with Strong Community Support Bonk (BONK) is a relative newcomer but has quickly become a fan favorite in the meme coin world. As the first major meme coin on the Solana network, it benefits from low transaction fees, high-speed transfers, and an ever-growing base of enthusiastic investors. Bonk is built on Solana, which gives it an advantage over Ethereum-based meme coins. Transactions are fast and cost just a fraction of a cent, making it easier for retail investors to trade without worrying about excessive gas fees. The Bonk community is also incredibly active, with a strong focus on decentralized governance and DeFi integrations. Recent token burns and ecosystem expansions have contributed to Bonk’s increasing scarcity, further fueling investor interest. With Solana-based tokens gaining traction and meme coins continuing to perform well, Bonk is one of the best new meme coins to invest in March 2025 for those looking to diversify beyond Ethereum-based meme assets. 4. Pudgy Penguins – A Meme Coin with a Strong Brand and NFT Connection If you’ve been in the NFT space, you’ve probably heard of Pudgy Penguins—one of the most successful NFT collections in history. Now, the Pudgy Penguins brand has entered the meme coin space with PENGU, a token designed to extend the brand’s reach into the crypto market. Pudgy Penguins has a massive following in the NFT space, which has naturally translated into strong demand for its token. The project has gone beyond digital assets by introducing physical merchandise and licensing deals, giving it an edge over other meme coins that rely solely on speculation. The team behind Pudgy Penguins recently burned over 12 billion tokens, reducing supply and potentially increasing scarcity-driven value. With an established brand and a growing ecosystem, Pudgy Penguins is easily one of the best new meme coins to invest in March 2025. Final Thoughts: Which Meme Coin Should You Buy? If you’re looking for the best new meme coins to invest in March 2025 , the choices above cover a range of investment styles—from referral-based rewards like BTFD Coin, to classic powerhouses like Dogecoin, emerging Solana plays like Bonk, utility-driven tokens like Dogs, and NFT-connected brands like Pudgy Penguins. Among them, BTFD Coin stands out for its innovative referral program, making it a unique investment opportunity for those who enjoy community-driven engagement and passive rewards. With its presale already raising nearly $6.28 million, this is a token worth keeping on your radar.

During a March 10 speech at the Washington Conference of the Institute of International Bankers, acting SEC Chairman Mark Uyeda said he had “asked SEC staff for options on abandoning” part of the proposed changes that would expand regulation of alternative trading systems (ATSs) to include crypto firms. “In light of the significant negative public comment received on the definition of exchange with respect to crypto, I have asked SEC staff for options on abandoning that part of the proposal,” he said. “In my view, it was a mistake for the commission to link together regulation of the Treasury markets with a heavy-handed attempt to tamp down the crypto market.” Uyeda says the rule was initially crafted in 2020 under former SEC Chairman Jay Clayton to establish more straightforward rules for alternative trading systems; the guidance was intended to mainly impact US Treasury market participants. Source: US Securities and Exchange Commission However, when it fell to former SEC Chair Gary Gensler to implement the rule, he took a “very different direction” by expanding the list beyond just ATSs. “Rather than focusing on the narrow issues relating to Government Securities ATSs, a new iteration of the rule was proposed in 2022 that would redefine the regulatory definition of an exchange,” Uyeda said. “The new definition of the term exchange included communications protocols without clearly defining what that term meant. Effectively, the vastly expanded definition of an exchange would have picked up various protocols used with respect to crypto assets,” he added. Related: Coinbase finds flawed analysis in SEC's proposed exchange definition Gensler’s time at the SEC came with an aggressive regulatory stance toward crypto . He brought upward of 100 regulatory actions against firms from 2021 until his resignation on Jan. 20, the same day as Donald Trump started his second term as US president. Trump had promised to fire Gensler if elected. After Genlers’ resignation, the SEC has since taken a new friendlier approach toward crypto. A growing number of firms facing legal action from the regulator have had their cases dismissed, including crypto exchange Gemini on Feb. 26, Kraken on March 3 and crypto trading firm Cumberland DRW on March 4 . Meanwhile, the agency has also launched a crypto task force dedicated to developing a framework for digital assets led by crypto-friendly Commissioner Hester Peirce.

Gox Moves $900M in Bitcoin, Sparking Concerns as Crypto Market Declines appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market continued its decline this week, with its market cap dropping to $2.44 trillion on Tuesday, the lowest since early November. This price drop triggered over $937 million in liquidations within 24 hours. Meanwhile, concerns grew as the defunct Mt. Gox exchange moved 11,833 BTC, worth $932 million. Mt. Gox has recently moved a significant amount of Bitcoin, totaling 11,834 BTC (worth approximately $910 million). This transfer includes 11,502 BTC (around $885 million) to a new wallet and 332 BTC (worth $25.5 million) to a “warm” wallet, which is typically used for transactions or active management of funds. https://twitter.com/spotonchain/status/1899263219065393536 Monday’s $900 million Bitcoin transfer came from the Mt. Gox wallet “1Mo1n,” which had received $1.07 billion in Bitcoin from another exchange last week. However, when the funds were moved last week, Arkham Intelligence didn’t recognize the “1Mo1n” address as a Mt. Gox wallet. The movement of Mt. Gox’s Bitcoin is closely watched because it is part of the ongoing process of repaying creditors who lost funds in the exchange’s infamous hack and bankruptcy. Just five days ago, Mt. Gox sent 166.5 BTC to BitGo, a digital asset custodian, likely as part of a creditor repayment process. The recent 332 BTC transfer is also expected to be moved soon, possibly as part of further repayments. The movement of Mt. Gox’s Bitcoin is significant for the broader crypto market because it could potentially flood the market with large amounts of Bitcoin if creditors decide to sell. This has raised concerns about potential market volatility. The creditors of Mt. Gox have been waiting years to receive their funds, and the repaid Bitcoin may be sold or held, depending on their decisions. Mt. Gox began repaying its creditors in July 2024 using its holdings of 142,000 BTC ($11 billion), 143,000 Bitcoin Cash ($47 million), and 69 billion yen ($469 million). While some creditors were paid through Kraken and Bitstamp, the repayment deadline was extended to October 31, 2025. The bankrupt exchange still holds $2.8 billion worth of Bitcoin in its wallets.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,MARKET|EXCHANGE|BCH|ARKM|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-11 03:46:51

Economists at Wall Street investment bank JPMorgan have raised their recession risk this year to 40%, up from 30% at the beginning of 2025. “We see a material risk that the US falls into recession this year owing to extreme US policies,” wrote the analysts, according to The Wall Street Journal. Analysts at Goldman Sachs economists also raised their 12-month recession probability to 20%, up from 15%. They said that the forecast could rise further if the Trump administration remains “committed to its policies even in the face of much worse data.” Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley economists lowered their economic growth forecasts last week and raised inflation expectations. The bank predicted a GDP growth of just 1.5% in 2025, falling to 1.2% in 2026. It comes despite a key economic adviser to US President Donald Trump pushed back against talks of a recession. Speaking to CNBC on March 10, Kevin Hassett, who heads the National Economic Council, said there were many reasons to be optimistic about the US economy. “There are a lot of reasons to be extremely bullish about the economy going forward. But for sure, this quarter, there are some blips in the data,” he said. Meanwhile, in an interview with Fox News on March 9, Donald Trump responded to a question about the possibility of a recession by saying the US economy was going through “a period of transition.” Blockchain betting platform Polymarket quipped that recession odds are “the best looking chart in finance right now.” Source: Polymarket Tech stock and crypto sell-off The so-called “Trump bump” has dissipated, with the S&P 500 now lower than it was before his Nov. 5 US election victory.

Doing so increases the likelihood that the US won’t need to refinance around $7 trillion in debt it owes over the next few months, Bitcoin commentator Anthony Pompliano said in a March 10 X post. US President Donald Trump and Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent are “taking matters into their own hands; they’re crashing asset prices in an attempt to force Jerome Powell to cut interest rates,” said Pompliano, who serves as the founder and CEO of Professional Capital Management and host of The Pomp Podcast. The President and his team are intentionally crashing the market. Is this a master plan or are we watching uncontrolled destruction?! pic.twitter.com/Tbc0M9Rjxu — Anthony Pompliano 🌪 (@APompliano) March 10, 2025 In late January, Powell announced the Fed was not lowering interest rates from the current target range of 4.25% to 4.5% despite calls from Trump to do so. Pompliano said the recent market panic has been driven in part by Trump’s tariffs — and has been used to create a more favorable bond market while lowering the 10-year Treasury yield. He noted that the 10-year Treasury yield is already down from nearly 4.8% in January to 4.21% now — a sign that Trump’s purported strategy is “heading in the right direction.” Source: Thomas Kralow Whether Pompliano’s theory is correct or not, the stock market has been tanking of late, and crypto has been hit even harder. Broad market index funds such as State Street’s Standard & Poor’s 500 index fund (SPY) fell 2.66% on March 10 alone, while the Nasdaq-100% fell 3.8%, Google Finance data shows. Both indexes are down 7.32% and 10.7% over the last month, while Bitcoin ( BTC ) is down 27.4% from its $108,786 all-time high, and over $1.2 trillion has been wiped from the cryptocurrency market cap since Dec. 17. If the stock market continues to tank, it will come down to a “who blinks first” contest between Trump and Powell, Pompliano said. While Trump hasn’t confirmed such a strategy, Pompliano pointed to a Fox News interview on March 9 where Trump said: “Nobody ever gets rich when the interest rates are high because people can’t borrow money.” Pompliano added that lowering interest rates would also benefit American consumers: “The big goal, get interest rates down, and that will lead to more economic activity, thanks to access to cheap capital. Give the people cheap capital and they’ll go and do things with it.” Related: Bitcoin dips to $80K in ‘ugly start,’ could retest key resistance: Hayes CME FedWatch, a tool used to measure expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate change, has tipped a 96% probability that the target rate will remain between 4.25% and 4.50% following the Federal Reserve’s next meeting on March 19. However, it’s near 50-50 odds for the target rate to be lowered in the Federal Reserve’s following meeting on May 7. The Federal Reserve typically avoids lowering interest rates when inflation is high , as one of its primary objectives is to maintain price stability. However, a Trump-inflicted recession, or “Trumpcession,” as some call it, could force America’s top bank to start cutting again.

This downturn comes despite the fact that many analysts remain optimistic about its long-term prospects. One particular technical analyst has now weighed in on when it would be wise to buy XRP, warning that its short-term outlook is shaky and its price may continue declining. Analyst Identifies The Ideal Buy Zone For XRP The past week has been challenging for XRP holders as the token has struggled to maintain key support levels. Its inability to hold these levels has pushed it closer to the $2 mark. However, the latest technical analysis suggests that this decline may not be over yet, and a further downside movement appears likely. Related Reading: Pundit Who Correctly Predicted XRP Price Crash To $2.5 Says Demand Zone Will Send It Soaring This XRP price decline has caused growing uncertainty among many retail investors, especially because XRP is increasingly becoming the choice of coin for retail investors in this cycle. Given XRP’s growing reputation as a retail favorite and its long-term bullish potential, this decline would be the best time for bullish investors to load up on more tokens. However, a crypto analyst recently warned that the current price is not the ideal entry point for those looking to capitalize on the coin’s bullish potential. Although XRP is one of the most promising cryptocurrencies from a technical perspective, the timing of purchases is also important. In a post on X, the analyst noted that XRP is the “retail coin,” often drawing attention from new investors who are convinced it will reach extreme price levels like $100. Despite this bullish momentum, he cautioned against buying at current prices, stating that the best time to enter would be if XRP dips to the $1.6 to $1.5 range. What this means is that the current trend suggests more downside movement in the short term, and it would be wiser to wait more before accumulating. Long-Term Bullish Case Despite Short-Term Weakness Even as XRP’s short-term outlook appears bearish, the analyst remains aligned with those expecting a major price surge in the future. Several technical analyses have painted an optimistic picture, with some projections placing the altcoin well beyond the double-digit threshold. One analyst, in particular, has even predicted a rally to $27 despite the ongoing market downturn. Related Reading: Crypto Pundit Reignites $100 XRP Price Target, What You Should Know The idea that XRP could eventually reach double and triple-digit valuations continues to attract investor interest, but this projection depends on market conditions and broader adoption trends. In the meantime, holders are struggling, without much success, to prevent a decline. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.16, down by 7.04% in the past 24 hours. The onus now is on whether the price can hold above $2. Even if it breaks below this level, it only opens up the possibility of an accumulation range between $1.6 to $1.5.

The network is dwindling downward, having posted a major loss in the last month due to a range of market factors as well as a technical glitch. And Ripple’s woes don’t end there. The network is facing stiff competition from a new rival, Remittix (RTX). This powerful PayFi solution is changing the game for global payments, offering low fees, reduced processing times and a transparent payment model. This forward-thinking design is causing Remittix to gain massive attention in its presale, which has raised more than $13.8 million to date. So who will prevail out of these two PayFi pioneers in 2025? Ripple Ledger Outage Shakes Investor Confidence In February, the Ripple ledger experienced an unexpected outage, which halted block production for more than an hour. Though the consensus mechanism appeared functional, validations were not being published, causing the network to drift apart. Fortunately, no assets were lost during this incident, but the event definitely had an impact on Ripple investor confidence. The asset has seen a steep 9.45% loss in the last month and an even steeper 18.2% dip in the last week, casting doubt over Ripple’s trajectory. Though Ripple made some impressive updates in 2024, such as with the integration of smart contracts on the XRP ledger and the successful launch of RLUSD, this outage marks a poor start to 2025. Remittix Changes The Game For Global Payments Remittix (RTX) is quickly securing its status as a market disruptor in the PayFi space. The platform has a core mission to streamline the conversion of cryptocurrencies into fiat currencies, allowing users to send funds directly to bank accounts across the globe. Remittix’s standout feature is its advanced PayFi protocol. This advanced piece of kit facilitates instant crypto-to-fiat conversions on more than 40 cryptocurrencies. These crypto assets are converted to FIAT when they are received, without the typical delays and fees that we have come to expect from legacy exchanges. Take a freelancer in India who gets paid in Bitcoin for working for clients in America. They can receive Bitcoin and have it converted into FIAT immediately, which they can then cash out for Indian Rupees to pay their bills and rent. For businesses, Remittix offers a plug-and-play API, enabling them to accept cryptocurrency payments while automatically converting them into fiat. This solution is helping businesses to sidestep the issues that come with crypto acceptance, such as dealing with market volatility. In addition, the integration process is extremely straightforward for merchants, broadening the adoption of digital currencies in everyday transactions.​ With a fixed supply of 1.5 billion RTX tokens, Remittix presents a scarcity factor that could drive value appreciation as adoption grows. Analysts are taking note of Remittix’s potential with some predicting significant price increases as the platform gains traction in the payments industry.​ Investors Snap Up RTX Tokens In Presale Investors are racing to the Remittix presale to secure their share of RTX tokens. Analysts have predicted an explosive 800% price rise during the presale with more growth expected post-launch. For any proactive investor looking to ride the crypto wave in 2025, this project is not one to gloss over.

As a result of President Trump refusing to predict whether his tariff policies could lead to a recession today, major U.S. stock indexes sank. The Nasdaq Composite slumped more than 3% after proving last week that its retreat from December’s record high was a correction. The S&P 500 slid 2%, down and about 8% from its all-time high. Today, a key economic adviser to President Donald Trump has voiced the probable stance of POTUS. He pushed back against claims that uncertainty about his administration’s tariff policies could cause a recession. This came as a survey of American households showed that people were becoming less optimistic about their futures, and U.S. stocks continued to fall. Kevin Hassett, who is in charge of the National Economic Council, said that there were many reasons to be optimistic about the U.S. economy, even though some people think the GDP will drop in the first quarter and there are worries about inflation. This is to say Trump is still in denial. However, many people insist that a recession is possible. In fact, former White House comms director Anthony Scaramucci isn’t holding back. He says Trump’s tariff policies could drag the U.S. into a recession. Wall Street experts take on the current market situation and recession Trump was seen as the market’s savior, promising lower taxes and less stringent regulation. Now, his actions represent the harbinger of doom. The R-word is back on everyone’s lips as people ponder if trade tariffs will backfire and lead to recession rather than U.S. economic prosperity. Dan Coatsworth, an investment analyst, said: “The U.S. market sell-off is starting to look ugly. Many people have been worried about elevated valuations among U.S. equities for some time and are looking for the catalyst for a market correction. A combination of concerns about a trade war, geopolitical tensions, and an uncertain economic outlook could be that catalyst.” He added, “During his first term as U.S. president, Donald Trump often cited a rising stock market as being representative of his success. As such, he will not want to see a full-blown market crash months into his second term.” True to this he had to postpone the Mexico and Canada tariffs. Clearly, he too can see the tariff formula has failed to work a second time. According to Ross Mayfield, InvestmentStrategist, “The Trump administration seems a little more accepting of the idea that they’re OK with the market falling, and they’re potentially even OK with a recession in order to exact their broader goals. He added, “I think that’s a big wake-up call for Wall Street. There had been a sense that President Trump kind of measured his success on stock market performance, there was even somewhat of a ‘Trump put’ so to speak, and I think we’re seeing that’s not the case, so the market is starting to reflect that reality.” It is no surprise. According to Chris Zaccarelli, the company’s chief investment manager, the NASDAQ has been risk-off all year. Today doesn’t add anything new to what we’ve seen over the last few weeks, but it does keep seeing the same things. Therefore, that’s just the bad combo of very high values at the beginning of the year and then more uncertainty. Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist, said: “What he’s trying to enact is structural change… And every time you have structural change you’re going to have uncertainty and you’re going to have friction. It’s understandable people are starting to be a little concerned and starting to take profits.” He advised, “Also, we’ve had this age of U.S. exceptionalism where the U.S. has massively outperformed… that’s also part of the backdrop that you could go invest in other places of the world with much lower multiples and maybe at least not be exposed to the expensive valuations of the U.S. while the U.S. pushes its structural shift.” In the same light, Idanna Appio, Portfolio Manager, says that the pressure on U.S. assets in general shows that people are less sure about U.S. policy. It’s hard for businesses to make decisions when they don’t know how or where to spend. This kind of uncertainty is bad for business in general. There is something to fix the uncertainty, according to Thomas Hayes, head of Great Hill Capital. He said that Japanese government bond yields are a better indicator of what’s happening in the U.S. market than tariffs. All that hot money was in Mag 7 during the carry trade, which is ending.

The price is now consolidating and might struggle to clear the $2.10 resistance zone. XRP price started a fresh decline from the $2.250 resistance zone. The price is now trading below $2.20 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.06 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might continue to move up if it clears the $2.10 resistance zone. XRP Price Dips Further XRP price started a fresh decline after it failed to clear the $2.250 zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price declined below the $2.10 and $2.050 support levels. The bears even pushed the price below $2.00. A low was formed at $1.90 and the price is now attempting to recover. There was a move above the $1.950 and $1.980 resistance levels. The price surpassed the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.260 swing high to the $1.90 low. The price is now trading below $2.20 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.060 level. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.06 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The first major resistance is near the $2.080 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.260 swing high to the $1.90 low. The next resistance is $2.120. A clear move above the $2.120 resistance might send the price toward the $2.1750 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.20 resistance or even $2.250 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.450. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.080 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1.950 level. The next major support is near the $1.90 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $1.850 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $1.80 support. The next major support sits near the $1.750 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level.

As meme coins lose popularity, traders are now turning toward blockchain projects with real utility and long-term value. One such emerging powerhouse is Rollblock – a GameFi revolution that combines DeFi, online gaming, and high-yield staking rewards. With over $10.8 million raised and a fast-growing user base, Rollblock is proving why real-world application matters more than hype in 2025. Rollblock (RBLK) Emerges as Ultimate Meme Coin Killer with Real Utility and Staking Rewards Rollblock is a premier GameFi project based on Ethereum that merges DeFi and online gaming in a unique way. With blockchain-powered security and lightning-fast withdrawals, Rollblock is bringing trust and transparency back to the $500 billion gaming market. The platform has already raised over $10.8 million during its presale, and the native RBLK token has witnessed a massive 610% demand-induced price surge in record time. Rollblock’s gaming ecosystem offers over 7,000 AI-powered titles, including classics like roulette and blockchain-exclusives like Zeppelin. The platform also has live dealer modes where players can recreate the thrill of a Vegas night out through AI-enhanced experiences. If that wasn’t enough, then Rollblock recently launched a sports prediction league on its ecosystem as well. This latest addition allows players to place high stakes bets on top sporting events worldwide as they watch the live stream and engage with other community members. To ensure fairness, Rollblock encrypts every wager on-chain and promises a tamper-proof betting experience. The platform is also fully licensed and regulated by the Anjouan E-gaming Authority, adding another layer of security to the GameFi ecosystem. Beyond this crypto-powered gaming experience, Rollblock investors can also lock their RBLK for a predefined period to secure staking rewards with up to 30% APY. These rewards are funded through Rollblock’s revenue sharing mechanism which uses up top 30% of the platform’s weekly revenue to repurchase RBLK on the open market. Of these, 40% are used as staking rewards while the remaining 60% are permanently burned to increase scarcity. The lucrative model gives users an ongoing passive income without sacrificing user confidence. Analysts note that Rollblock’s low market cap and unique blend of entertainment and utility could outshine meme coins in 2025, making now the ideal time to accumulate RBLK for a low price of just $0.061. Chainlink (LINK) Prepares for Rebound as On-chain Metrics Suggest Accumulation Chainlink’s price action has remained somewhat bearish during the past week, recording a total of 17.59% weekly losses . Despite this sluggish growth, Chainlink’s on-chain indicators suggest strong accumulation behind the scenes. One key metric supporting this outlook is Chainlink’s mean coin age which suggests that LINK tokens are being held for increasingly longer periods. Additionally, Chainlink’s Market Value to Realized Value ratio at -26.29% suggests that Chainlink is due for a strong rebound in March. Chainlink is currently selling for $13.59 following an intraday decrease of 5.38%. Since Chainlink has held a strong support at the $13 level, buyers may push the price toward the nearest resistance at $17.45 in the coming days. Pepe (PEPE) Shows Signs of Sell-off After Compromised X Account Pepe has been trending downward ever since it reached an all-time high of $0.00002825 in December 2024. In recent days, Pepe stagnated as it reached a low of $0.00000627 on March 4. Although the token has made a slight recovery since then, Pepe is still fluctuating within a tight range between $0.00000627 and $0.00000736. Last week, Pepe issued an official warning that its X account has been hacked . Since this development raised concerns about phishing scams and fraud among investors, Pepe is now witnessing a sell-off by retail investors . Pepe is currently selling for $0.00000626 following an intraday increase of 2.63%. Despite this minor uptick, Pepe is still trading below all of its Exponential Moving Averages which confirms the strong downward pressure. Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) Recent Market Activity Fails to Trigger Rally Shiba Inu has witnessed a notable transaction volume of 3.7 trillion tokens over the past week, indicating a sudden spike in SHIB’s network activity. This surge comes at a time when Shiba Inu recorded 9.92% weekly losses and continues to trend downward. Since Shiba Inu’s short-term moving averages are still pushing the token lower, the price chart clearly displays a bearish trend. Despite the significant market activity, there is not enough buying pressure to trigger a recovery for Shiba Inu. Shiba Inu is currently selling for $0.00001237 following an intraday increase of 2.92%. If Shiba Inu fails to maintain the $0.0000125 support level, the meme coin could face an increased risk of downside in the coming days. The Best Memecoins are Fading, But Rollblock is Just Getting Started While the best memecoins struggle with volatility, Rollblock is setting a new standard with blockchain transparency, on-chain gaming, and a lucrative staking ecosystem. As RBLK’s presale enters its final stages, early investors are betting big on its potential to dominate the GameFi sector. With its innovative revenue-sharing model and massive adoption potential, Rollblock is emerging as the ultimate meme coin killer—offering not just entertainment but real earnings for its community.

Since the start of the year, multiple events have occurred that favored the crypto space. Trump’s inauguration, his plans to make America the Bitcoin capital of the world, SEC dropping lawsuits & investigations, Trump’s buying more and more cryptos, and importantly, the creation of a Bitcoin Statergic Reserve. Despite all these, the BTC price failed to reclaim $100K and dropped more than 20% from the consolidated zone around $96,600. What’s Causing the Downfall? Historically, the stock markets and the crypto markets have been inversely correlated. The stock market crash has always benefited cryptos. Now, when the Nasdaq witnessed its worst drop since 2022, wiping out over $1.7 trillion from the market, Bitcoin & cryptos are dumping too. This suggests the institutions now hold a major stake over the markets, which may not be good for healthy crypto markets. The drop in the spot and the future market volume substantiate the claim. Will the BTC price Continue to Drop? Has the Bear Market Officially Begun? On the other hand, other cryptos like XRP, Cardano, & Solana are demonstrating strength while Ethereum closely follows Bitcoin’s footsteps. This suggests that the other popular altcoins remain stable, hinting towards a correction rather than the start of a bear market. Meanwhile, the traders have become bearish on Bitcoin as cumulative shorts continue to accumulate, but this may not impact the other tokens or the entire markets. On the other hand, Mt.Gox has yet again moved BTC worth over $900 million to various platforms, which is expected to add to the selling pressure. However, President Trump is set to sign executive orders overturning Biden’s crypto banking restrictions. In the times when accumulation remains relatively low, it could be interesting to watch in which direction the markets may flow in the coming days as uncertainty is rising to its peak.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|TRADING|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-11 05:15:38

Gramegna cautioned that the US crypto pivot “could eventually reignite foreign and US tech giants’ plans to launch mass payment solutions based on dollar-denominated stablecoin,” adding, “And if this were to be successful, it could affect the euro area’s monetary sovereignty and financial stability.” The ESM “supports the ECB’s urgency in making the digital euro a reality to safeguard Europe’s strategic autonomy — this digital euro is today more necessary than ever,” he added. The ESM is an intergovernmental organization established by member states of the euro area, helping countries overcome financial crises and maintain long-term financial stability and prosperity. Pierre Gramegna speaking on US crypto threat. Source: YouTube “Policy developments in other jurisdictions can have important consequences for us here in Europe,” concurred Irish finance minister Paschal Donohoe. “These discussions are fundamentally linked to our own autonomy and to the resilience of our currency,” he added, stating that a European central bank digital currency (CBDC) was now critical to staying ahead of the curve. In February, the European Central Bank said it was expanding the development of its CBDC payment system to settle transactions between institutions. The ECB has been exploring CBDCs since 2020, including a consumer-facing retail digital euro and wholesale cross-border settlement between central banks. Meanwhile, Trump has spoken out against a Federal Reserve CBDC, signing an executive order in January to establish a crypto working group while prohibiting the “establishment, issuance, circulation, and use” of a US CBDC. Related: Crypto academics slam controversial ECB paper blasting Bitcoin The ECB has also rejected the idea of adding Bitcoin ( BTC ) to its monetary reserves or allowing other European central banks to do so. In late January, ECB President Christine Lagarde said that the reserves of central banks have to be “liquid, secure and safe,” implying that they would not include crypto assets. She added that she was “confident” that Bitcoin would not enter the reserves of banks under the European Council.

In the wake of Donald Trump’s return to the White House, speculation has emerged that the administration may be influencing market conditions to push for lower interest rates. At the same time, the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector has seen a sharp decline, wiping out gains made since Trump’s election, with Ethereum and Solana among the hardest hit. Is Trump Engineering a Market Meltdown to Force Powell’s Hand on Interest Rates? The financial markets have been thrown into turmoil amid growing speculation that the Trump administration may be strategically engineering uncertainty to pressure Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell into cutting interest rates. According to Bitcoin advocate and market commentator Anthony Pompliano, President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent could be deliberately stoking market volatility to force Powell’s hand. Their goal, Pompliano suggests, is to lower borrowing costs ahead of the US government’s refinancing of approximately $7 trillion in debt over the next few months. Pompliano’s theory, shared in a March 10 post on X, suggests that Trump’s recent moves—including implementing tariffs and making strong public statements against high interest rates—are part of a broader strategy to create market instability. By doing so, the administration may be trying to build pressure on Powell to cut rates, which would ease borrowing costs and make it cheaper for the US government to manage its growing debt obligations. “The Trump administration is crashing asset prices in an attempt to force Jerome Powell to cut interest rates,” said Pompliano, who serves as the founder and CEO of Professional Capital Management and host of The Pomp Podcast. His argument centers on the decline in the 10-year Treasury yield , which has fallen from nearly 4.8% in January to 4.21% now. The drop suggests that investors are anticipating looser monetary policy in the near future, which would align with Trump’s broader economic vision. The apparent standoff between Trump and Powell dates back to the president’s first term, when he frequently criticized the Federal Reserve for maintaining high interest rates. Now, with Trump back in the White House, the pressure campaign appears to be escalating. In late January, Powell reaffirmed that the Fed would not lower interest rates from their current target range of 4.25% to 4.50%, despite Trump’s public demands for cuts. This has fueled speculation that the White House is using other means—such as market turbulence—to make rate cuts inevitable. Recent stock market sell-offs lend credibility to this theory. Broad market indexes suffered significant losses on March 10, with the S&P 500 index fund (SPY) falling 2.66% and the Nasdaq-100 plummeting 3.8%. Over the past month, the S&P 500 is down 7.32%, while the Nasdaq-100 has shed 10.7%. The cryptocurrency market has fared even worse. Bitcoin (BTC) has plunged 27.4% from its record high of $108,786, bringing its current price to $79,726. Since Dec. 17, over $1.2 trillion in market capitalization has evaporated from the crypto sector. The continued downturn, Pompliano argues, could eventually reach a breaking point where the Federal Reserve is left with no choice but to cut rates. Trump himself has not explicitly confirmed such a strategy, but his recent remarks indicate that he sees high interest rates as a significant economic impediment. “Nobody ever gets rich when the interest rates are high because people can’t borrow money,” Trump said in a March 9 Fox News interview. Pompliano believes this statement reinforces the idea that Trump’s ultimate objective is to drive interest rates lower—whether through direct influence over the Fed or through economic disruption that makes cuts unavoidable. “The big goal is to get interest rates down, and that will lead to more economic activity thanks to access to cheap capital,” he added. “Give the people cheap capital, and they’ll go and do things with it.” Will Powell Blink? Market Expectations Are Split The Federal Reserve’s next meeting on March 19 is unlikely to result in a rate cut. According to CME FedWatch, a tool that tracks market expectations for Fed rate decisions, there is a 96% probability that the central bank will maintain its current policy. However, the outlook for the following meeting on May 7 is much less certain. Market expectations suggest nearly a 50-50 chance that Powell and his colleagues could decide to lower rates. Historically, the Federal Reserve has been reluctant to cut rates when inflation remains a concern, as one of its primary objectives is to maintain price stability. Lowering rates too soon could risk reigniting inflationary pressures, something Powell has repeatedly warned against. But if Trump’s suspected strategy succeeds in triggering a recession—or at least a severe enough downturn—then the Fed may have little choice but to ease monetary policy to stabilize the economy. This scenario, which some analysts have labeled a “Trumpcession,” could play out if market instability worsens in the coming months. The theory that Trump is intentionally crashing markets to gain leverage over Powell remains speculative. However, the unfolding events suggest a calculated effort to influence the Federal Reserve’s decision-making process. Whether this strategy will ultimately work remains uncertain. Powell and the Fed have so far resisted political pressure, maintaining that their policy decisions are guided by economic fundamentals rather than political influence. But with markets on edge, the coming weeks could prove to be a crucial test of who blinks first—Trump or Powell. Regardless of the outcome, the current financial turmoil underscores the delicate balance between monetary policy, political influence, and economic stability. Investors should brace for continued volatility as the battle over interest rates intensifies. DeFi Market Wipes Out Trump-Era Gains as Ethereum Struggles Amid Market Uncertainty In other news, the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector has seen a dramatic reversal in fortunes, wiping out all the gains it accumulated since Donald Trump was elected US president in November 2024. After reaching a peak of $138 billion in total value locked (TVL) on Dec. 17, DeFi’s TVL has since plummeted to $92.6 billion by March 10, marking a steep decline that sheds light on the sector’s ongoing challenges. Crypto analyst Miles Deutscher was among those who highlighted this trend, pointing to a combination of market factors driving the downturn. While the entire DeFi sector has suffered, Ethereum and Solana have been particularly hard hit. Solana, which saw a meteoric rise in popularity due to meme coins and low-cost transactions, has struggled to maintain its traction. The fading appeal of Solana’s meme coins has contributed to its TVL decline, leading to concerns about its long-term growth. Ethereum, the backbone of DeFi, has also faced significant hurdles. Despite Bitcoin reaching an all-time high of $109,000 on Jan. 20—the day of Trump’s inauguration—Ethereum’s price has failed to revisit its previous high of $4,787 from November 2021. Instead, ETH has remained underwhelming, with its TVL shrinking by $30.6 billion from cycle highs, according to DefiLlama data. Despite positive developments, such as the launch of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US and Trump’s executive order for a strategic Bitcoin reserve, Ethereum has been unable to capitalize on the broader market momentum. One of the most notable trends in recent weeks has been Ethereum’s massive net exchange outflows. According to IntoTheBlock data, approximately 800,000 ETH—worth about $1.8 billion—was withdrawn from exchanges in the week starting March 3. This marks the highest seven-day net outflow since December 2022. Typically, when large amounts of a cryptocurrency leave exchanges, it signals a long-term holding strategy or movement into DeFi applications like staking or yield farming. However, this recent outflow coincided with a 10% drop in Ether’s price, which fell as low as $2,007 during the period. This is an unusual dynamic, as exchange outflows generally occur when prices are rising rather than falling. “Despite ongoing pessimism around Ether prices, this trend suggests many holders see current levels as a strategic buying opportunity,” IntoTheBlock stated in a March 10 post on X. Before March 3, Ethereum had experienced net exchange inflows daily, indicating that investors were actively selling during the market downturn. According to Juan Pellicer, senior research analyst at IntoTheBlock, Ether’s dip to $2,100 may have triggered accumulation, prompting investors to withdraw their holdings from exchanges for long-term storage or staking. Ethereum’s Pectra Upgrade Encounters Challenges Amid these market shifts, Ethereum developers continue working on major upgrades aimed at improving the network’s efficiency and usability. The upcoming Pectra upgrade seeks to address some of the network’s long-standing issues, particularly liquidity fragmentation caused by Ethereum’s rollup-centric roadmap. By doubling the number of blobs in transactions, Pectra aims to lower gas fees and improve layer-2 interoperability. Additionally, account abstraction improvements will make smart contract wallets more seamless across Ethereum and layer-2 networks, enhancing bridging and fund management. However, the rollout has encountered its own set of challenges. On March 5, the Pectra upgrade launched on Ethereum’s Sepolia testnet, but it quickly ran into issues. Ethereum developer Marius van der Wijden reported that Geth nodes were experiencing errors, and empty blocks were being mined due to a deposit contract triggering an incorrect event type. A fix has since been deployed, but the setback highlights the technical hurdles that still exist in Ethereum’s evolution. The decline in DeFi TVL signals broader concerns about the industry’s resilience. While macroeconomic conditions and regulatory uncertainty have played a role, the downturn also raises questions about the sustainability of DeFi’s explosive growth in previous cycles. Ethereum’s struggles to reach new highs, even in the face of positive catalysts like ETFs and network upgrades, suggest that DeFi still faces an uphill battle in regaining investor confidence. Additionally, the market shift toward Bitcoin—evidenced by its all-time high earlier this year—suggests that many investors are prioritizing stability over riskier DeFi investments. With nearly $50 billion in DeFi TVL wiped out since December, the industry will need to adapt to a changing landscape. Whether the Pectra upgrade and continued Ethereum development can reinvigorate DeFi remains to be seen, but for now, the sector is grappling with one of its most significant downturns in recent history.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|ETH|FIAT|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-11 05:30:00

Over the past week, Bitcoin has declined by 14.6%, with its price dropping an additional 4.4% in the last 24 hours. As of today, Bitcoin is trading at $79,766, pushing it nearly 27% below its ATH. Amid this price performance, CryptoQuant analyst ibrahimcosar has closely examined Bitcoin’s price movements, focusing on the CME gap phenomenon, which has historically played a role in Bitcoin’s short-term fluctuations. Related Reading: Crypto Pundit Dumps Bitcoin Holdings Sub-$100,000, Lists Reasons Why It’s Time To Short What To Expect From Bitcoin Based On CME Gap In his latest analysis, Ibrahim highlighted how BTC opened at $82,110 on the CME, creating a gap up to the $86K level. According to him, this price gap could provide clues about Bitcoin’s next move, potentially leading to a short-term attempt at reclaiming $86K–$90K in the coming days. The CME gap refers to the difference between BTC’s closing price on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) before the weekend and its opening price after the weekend. These gaps often get filled as BTC’s price moves back to the levels where the trading pause occurred. Ibrahim notes that Bitcoin previously formed a $10,000 gap on February 28, which was quickly filled within 19 hours. Now, with BTC currently trading around $79K–$80K, the analyst suggests that another gap has formed above the current price range, indicating that Bitcoin may attempt to fill the $86K–$90K region within the next one to two days. However, he cautions that this does not necessarily signal a full reversal in BTC’s downtrend. Instead, he maintains that Bitcoin’s broader trend remains uncertain, and its price action through March and early April will be key in determining whether a stronger recovery is on the horizon. Key Support Levels and Market Sentiment Another market analyst, ShayanBTC, has pointed to $83,000 as a critical support level, based on Bitcoin’s interaction with the Realized Price of 3-6 Month UTXOs. This metric tracks the average acquisition price of mid-term holders and has historically acted as a significant support or resistance zone. Shayan disclosed that BTC recently tested this level, and holding above it could signal strong investor confidence, potentially reinforcing bullish sentiment. However, Bitcoin’s decline below $80,000 suggests that this $83,000 support level has already been breached. If Bitcoin fails to regain ground above this threshold, market sentiment could shift towards fear, leading to increased selling pressure from mid-term holders. In this scenario, BTC could enter a distribution phase, where short to mid-term investors sell their holdings, further driving the price downward. Ibrahim has identified the $78,000–$80,000 region as the next key support zone, which may determine BTC’s near-term trajectory.

The Remittix token has obtained more than $13.8 million by selling over 517 million tokens for a price of $0.0734 each and experts believe it represents a major profit opportunity. XRP 2.0 and Remittix: A New Payment Contender XRP 2.0 has become a popular nickname assigned to Remittix due to its similarities in addressing market requirements that Ripple’s original payment token controlled. XRP established itself in cross-border finance through affordable speedy payment transactions. Remittix continues the journey it started by reaching consumers through various payment solutions with cut-rate prices and swift transaction speeds. Many experts predict Remittix will surpass all projections made about Ripple. The $13.8 million+ in presale funding demonstrates that crypto investors want to see tokens that connect payment methods between traditional currencies and regular cryptocurrency transactions. The phrase XRP 2.0 points to more than just fast payments. Remittix sets itself the challenge to eliminate the issues digital assets face due to lengthy crypto-to-fiat swaps and regulatory obstacles and complicated user experiences. The integration of practical solutions in the Remittix system places the digital currency in position to replace previous payment tokens and become the standard for fast digital payouts. Different market watchers predict that the token will expand like major successful coins as long as it maintains its business partnerships and alliance development. How Remittix Tackles Real-World Problems The increased attention on XRP 2.0 stems from Remittix’s ability to address meaningful demands of consumers and businesses. Numerous coins promote advanced features yet they do not necessarily provide straightforward access for everyday users. The Remittix system prioritizes PayFi which includes speedy transactions between digital currency and regular money systems at low transaction costs. Remittix avoids complicated smart contract systems by concentrating on payment network connection. The system allows shoppers and freelancers to transform their tokens into local currency using an approach which minimizes user inconvenience. The market’s rejection of speculative tokens leads to this practical approach being introduced. The market desires altcoins which provide everyday convenience. The system of Remittix provides straightforward access to cross-border remittances and instant checkouts as well as quick peer-to-peer payments for its users. The “ XRP 2.0 ” designation may just be the start of larger developments in the market since analysts suggest an upcoming 1500x potential rise. Potential for a 1500x Rally The current market speculations regarding 1500x returns appear exaggerated yet past cryptocurrency cycles proved that coin values dramatically increase upon achieving mass adoption in the real world. Near-instant conversions and compliance characteristics give Remittix supporters a clear advantage over other coins. Public trading will receive a boost from the strong presale market support which developers have already demonstrated. The price of Remittix tokens will see dramatic upward movement when it succeeds in gaining partnerships with remittance services and major merchants due to increased token demand. No cryptocurrency will achieve certain profitability in the markets. The business may suffer from market modifications along with regulatory changes and fierce competition threats to growth potential. Remittix supporters utilize the XRP 2.0 branding as evidence of the platform’s promising prospects. Final Thoughts: More Than Just a Nickname The XRP 2.0 designation on Remittix reveals its goal to build upon Ripple’s work by reshaping cross-border payments and everyday transactions. Remittix now holds a critical position because their fundraising generated over $13.8 million by selling 517 million+ tokens for $0.0734 while their goal is to generate 1500x returns. The attention Remittix pays to user requirements positions it better than hype alone to achieve major price growth according to some analysts. The success of this new payment solution as “ XRP 2.0 ” depends on the achievement of secure fast accessible transactions that may replace current top-ranked solutions.

Market analysts believe that the correction is not over yet and BTC could crash further all the way under $70,000 before resuming the uptrend. Amid heavy selloff on Wall street, crypto market has extended losses this week, with altcoins facing an even greater crash during this period. Bitcoin Price Can Correct All The Way to $69,000 Renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez has outlined critical price levels for Bitcoin, suggesting the importance of maintaining current support of $80,000. He said that as long BTC holds this support levels, the bullish momentum will remain intact. However, he warned that a dip below this level could open the door to a further Bitcoin price decline , with $69,000 emerging as the next significant support level. Source: Ali Martinez BTC Recovery Depends on Macro Factors Former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes has also shared a similar outlook on the Bitcoin price trajectory, while urging investors to maintain patience amid the current volatility. Hayes projects Bitcoin’s bottom around $70,000, a 36% correction from its all-time high of $110,000—“very normal for a bull market,” he stated. He emphasized that the recovery depends on several macroeconomic factors. Arthur Hayes wrote : “We need stock indices like $SPX and $NDX to free fall, a TradFi player to collapse, and central banks like the Fed, PBOC, ECB, and BOJ to ease monetary policies to ‘make their country great again’”. Additionally, Hayes also advised investors to undertake a cautious approach and not fall for “buy the dip” narrative. “Wait for central banks to ease before deploying more capital. You might not catch the bottom, but you’ll avoid prolonged sideways movement and unrealized losses,” he added. Considering the historical trends of the previous bull runs of 2017 and 2021, the average Bitcoin price correction was between 35-37%. So far in this cycle, BTC has corrected 25%, which shows further room on the downside if the trend repeats. BTC Panic Selling to Continue? Blockchain analytics platform Santiment reported that there’s a massive level of fear at the moment with investors expecting the Bitcoin price to sink under $70,000. Commeting on Bitcoin’s capitulation phase, Santiment noted that the optimal buying opportunity will arise when social media sentiment shifts predominantly bearish. Source: Santiment On the other hand, the outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs have remained consistent averging around $300 million daily, for the last three days. This shows that BTC institutional interest has been waning severely. On the other hand, XRP has outpaced BTC in weekly inflows over the past few weeks. Despite this, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood remains confident that current economic trends could lead to a deflationary boom.

She believes this situation will offer more policy flexibility for both a potential Trump administration and the Powell-led Federal Reserve than investors currently expect. According to Wood, this extra flexibility could help drive the U.S. economy into a “deflationary boom” in the second half of the year, potentially leading to lower prices and an overall improvement in economic conditions.

The crypto market is under significant pressure, with the total market cap dropping by $57 billion in the past 24 hours to $2.55 trillion amid concerns over the US economy. Bitcoin led the decline, falling to an intraday low of $76,600, while altcoin FET plunged 15%.

March 11, 2025 05:46:43 UTC Sam Bankman-Fried Seeks Trump Pardon According to Fortune, former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) is seeking a pardon from President Trump. SBF has launched a series of high-profile campaigns, including an unauthorized appearance on the Tucker Carlson Show, which reportedly led to him being put in solitary confinement. However, political insiders believe that his chances of receiving a pardon are extremely low, given the current political climate and the ongoing controversies surrounding his case.

Bitcoin has slipped below $80K, while Ethereum trades near its 2022 bear market lows. Meanwhile, tokens like $OM, $IP, and $MOVE are holding strong amid the downturn. Overall, the crypto market cap stands at $2.74 trillion, with BTC dominance at 58.10% and the Fear & Greed Index at 24, signaling extreme fear among investors.

XRP will 10X minimum. ALTS will 10x-50X. STAY STEADY and FOCUSED!” This statement reflects a strong confidence in the potential growth of Bitcoin, XRP, and alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins). Bitcoin’s Prospective New All-Time High Egrag Crypto’s assertion that “Bitcoin will reach new ATH” suggests an anticipation of Bitcoin surpassing its previous all-time high. While specific figures were not provided in this statement, historical patterns and market analyses often serve as the basis for such projections. \The performance of Bitcoin is frequently viewed as an indicator of the broader cryptocurrency market, influencing investor sentiment and the valuation of other digital assets. XRP’s Potential for Significant Growth The prediction that “XRP will 10X minimum” indicates an expectation that XRP could increase in value by at least ten times its current price. This aligns with previous analyses conducted by Egrag Crypto. As reported by Times Tabloid , the analyst identified key price targets for XRP, including $9.7 and $27, based on historical market cycles and technical analysis. These targets were derived from patterns observed during previous bull runs, suggesting that similar conditions could lead to substantial price appreciation for XRP. https://twitter.com/TimesTabloid1/status/1680250907504656385 Altcoins’ Expected Surge The statement further predicts that “#ALTS will 10x-50x,” implying that alternative cryptocurrencies could experience growth ranging from ten to fifty times their current valuations. This broad projection reflects the high volatility and potential for rapid appreciation inherent in many altcoins. Investors often seek substantial returns in this market, though such opportunities are accompanied by increased risk. Community Response and Regulatory Considerations Egrag Crypto’s optimistic outlook has garnered attention within the cryptocurrency community. A user identified as SpectraON commented : “Xrp will be the winner. Many countries are watching closely to see when the SEC will drop the case.” This remark highlights the ongoing legal proceedings involving Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) . The outcome of this case is considered a significant factor that could influence XRP’s future valuation and adoption. Regulatory clarity is often critical in the broader acceptance and integration of cryptocurrencies into traditional financial systems. Egrag Crypto’s recent projections underscore a bullish sentiment within the cryptocurrency market, particularly concerning Bitcoin, XRP, and altcoins. While these predictions are grounded in historical analyses and technical patterns, it is essential to approach such forecasts with caution.

Bullish Divergence Spotted on Daily Chart! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP, Ripple Labs’ native token, is in a crucial make-or-break situation due to bearish market sentiment and a recent price decline. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that XRP has lost over 6% of its value in the past 24 hours and is currently at a critical support level of $1.95. XRP Technical Analysis and Its Key Levels However, the XRP daily chart shows signs of price recovery and now appears to be rebounding. According to expert technical analysis, XRP’s daily chart is witnessing a bullish divergence, indicating a potential price recovery. Source: Trading View In the chart, while the asset’s price is making a lower low, XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) has formed a higher high, suggesting that the asset is poised for a price recovery and an upside rally. Based on recent price action and historical momentum, if XRP holds above the $1.95 level, there is a strong possibility that it could soar by 40% to reach $2.95 in the coming days. Despite a notable price decline in recent days, the asset still holds above the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA), indicating that it is in an uptrend.

Traders Bearish Outlook Apart from this, intraday traders are currently over-leveraged at the $2.08 level, where traders betting on the long side have built $10.30 million worth of long positions. Meanwhile, $2.136 is another over-leveraged level where traders betting on the short side have built $19 million worth of short positions.

He is now asking Trump for a pardon after his crypto exchange FTX collapsed, leading to a 25-year prison sentence. SBF’s High Profile Efforts To Seek Pardon Now, Bankman-Fried is trying to turn things around by asking former President Trump for a pardon. His efforts include making high-profile appearances on conservative media outlets, including an unsanctioned spot on “The Tucker Carlson Show”, which got him placed in solitary confinement. While Carlson didn’t directly ask about a pardon, he showed interest in some Republican ideas, sparking rumors in the community about a Trump pardon after the interview aired. After the interview, Polymarket prediction platform, reported that the chances of a Sam Bankman-Fried pardon nearly doubled. According to The New York Times, he’s consulting with a lawyer close to Trump and his father even wrote an opinion piece in favor of Trump’s plans for a sovereign wealth fund. Insiders Doubtful Over His Chances However, despite the efforts, insiders are doubtful about his chances. One anonymous crypto lobbyist said his chances of getting a pardon are “zero,” adding, “Sorry, it’s Trump world… near zero.” The idea of Bankman-Fried getting a pardon isn’t impossible. Trump has previously supported crypto and pardoned Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht, a figure popular in the crypto world. However, Ulbricht had a strong following in the crypto community, while Bankman-Fried is disliked, especially after causing the FTX collapse and the resulting crypto downturn. SBF’s family, including his parents Joe Bankman and Barbara Fried, are consulting with a lawyer connected to Trump’s past campaigns to help secure a pardon. Although they haven’t contacted Trump directly, they hope his transactional approach to clemency will work in their favor. However, the clemency effort has not gained much momentum. On the other side, a crypto lobbyist told Fortune that Bankman-Fried’s chances might be increasing due to Trump’s growing ties with the industry and his willingness to grant pardons. However, the lobbyist pointed out that the wider crypto community hasn’t prioritized Bankman-Fried’s case, so a pardon still seems unlikely.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-11 05:45:52

Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President took the oath of office for his second term. The crypto market has experienced heightened selling pressure during the past eight weeks amid the mixed fundamentals, especially from the political environment. Despite the Trump administration announcing the strategic Bitcoin and crypto reserve , which was highly anticipated, the ongoing tariff trade wars have changed the entire market dynamics. Consequently, on-chain data shows institutional investors have dramatically reduced their appetite for crypto assets, led by the U.S. spot BTC ETFs which have lost over $4.3 billion in the past two months. Bitcoin Price Expectations Today After dropping more than 14 percent last week, Bitcoin (BTC) price has been retesting a crucial support level of around $78k in the past two days. In the two-hour timeframe, BTC price has been forming a potential bearish continuation pattern, with the next target around $73.7k. According to Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, Bitcoin price will likely continue in bearish sentiment until major global central banks – led by the Fed, PBOC, ECB, and BoJ – kickstarts quantitative easing (QE) to stir up growth in their respective economies. The plan: Be fucking patient. $BTC likely bottoms around $70k. 36% correction from $110k ATH, v normal for a bull market. Then we need stonks, $SPX and $NDX to enter free fall. Then we need TradFi muppet to go under. THEN we get Fed, PBOC, ECB, and BOJ all easing to make… — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) March 11, 2025 Ethereum Price Prediction The Ethereum (ETH) market has led the wider altcoin industry in bearish sentiment in the recent past. The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $225 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of about $41 billion, closed last week below a crucial support range between $2.1k and $2.2k. As a result, it is safe to assume that the Ethereum sellers have the higher ground over the buyers. In the past 24 hours, Ether’s price retested the rising trendline of a regular chart of the weekly timeframe. However, a consistent close below $1,760 will trigger a heavy selloff in the coming weeks for Ether. According to crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen , Ethereum price will likely bottom out after the Fed ends the prolonged Quantitative Tightening (QT). XRP Price Prediction Ripple Labs’ XRP price has been forming a potential reversal pattern since early December 2024, characterized by a head and shoulders (H&S) formation coupled with a bearish divergence of the weekly Relative Strength Index. In the past few days, the XRP price has been retesting a crucial support level around $2, which coincides with the possible neckline of the H&S pattern. If the XRP buyers fail to defend the current support level, a major selloff towards $1.5, which coincides with the 0.618 weekly Fibonacci Retracement , will be inevitable. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

41464866,https://coinpedia.org/?p=430359,1741672026,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,Best Crypto to Buy: Why Mind of Pepe Could Be the Next 100x Meme Coin,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/best-crypto-to-buy-why-mind-of-pepe-could-be-the-next-100x-meme-coin/,"The post Best Crypto to Buy: Why Mind of Pepe Could Be the Next 100x Meme Coin appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News MIND of Pepe (MIND) , an emerging AI-driven meme coin, continues its impressive presale campaign, raising $7.1 million in just a few months. The overall crypto market has faced resistance, with the meme coin sector seeing a sharp downturn. The total market cap for meme coins currently stands at $51.1 billion, down 8.9% in the last 24 hours, while the AI meme coin market cap has dropped by 7.3% in the same period. Despite these challenges, MIND of Pepe continues to attract regular investments, securing up to $100,000 per day in presale funding. One key factor behind this sustained momentum is MIND of Pepe’s unique approach, blending artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. The project promises upcoming AI-powered innovations, setting it apart from traditional meme coins that rely solely on hype and speculation. Currently, MIND tokens are priced at $0.003816 , with prices expected to increase through subsequent presale rounds. As momentum builds, investors are closely watching how MIND of Pepe will evolve in the AI-meme coin space. How MIND of Pepe Aims to Redefine the Meme Coin Sector Most meme coins rely on community-driven hype, lacking real-world functionality. However, MIND of Pepe is taking a different approach by integrating AI-driven technology into its ecosystem. The project’s upcoming AI agent is expected to autonomously interact with blockchain networks, analyze on-chain activity, and provide real-time insights for traders and investors. https://twitter.com/MINDofPepe/status/1898134450158104871 The team behind MIND of Pepe has outlined plans to develop a self-evolving AI system that will monitor market sentiment, decentralized applications (dApps), and social media trends. This AI-powered analysis could give users an edge in identifying potential market movements before they happen. Additionally, MIND of Pepe is exploring hive-mind analysis, a method that processes vast amounts of data to detect sentiment shifts in the crypto market. Another standout feature in the project’s roadmap is an AI-powered token-creation mechanism. Over time, the AI system is expected to autonomously generate new tokens that reflect market sentiment and emerging trends, creating an evolving ecosystem that adapts to real-world conditions. With these planned innovations, MIND of Pepe aims to break away from traditional meme coin limitations, positioning itself as a forward-thinking AI-meme hybrid. Earn High Staking Yield With MIND Tokens Beyond its upcoming AI-driven capabilities, MIND of Pepe is already offering one of the most attractive staking programs in the crypto space. Currently, the staking APY (annual percentage yield) stands at 315%, allowing holders to earn substantial rewards while maintaining their position in the ecosystem. So far, out of the total 100 billion token supply, more than 1.1 billion MIND tokens have been staked, demonstrating strong community confidence in the project’s long-term potential. As more investors stake their tokens, the circulating supply of MIND will continue to decrease, potentially driving scarcity and demand. However, as the staking pool grows, the APY is expected to decline gradually, making early participation more rewarding. For those looking for long-term exposure to the AI-meme coin sector, MIND of Pepe’s staking incentives offer an added layer of value, making it a compelling option for passive income seekers. Why Crypto Analysts Are Closely Watching MIND MIND of Pepe’s strong presale performance and AI integration have caught the attention of crypto analysts and influencers, many of whom see it as a project with long-term growth potential. One such influencer, crypto YouTuber ClayBro, who has over 138,000 subscribers, recently covered MIND of Pepe’s potential to disrupt the AI crypto space. AI Agents And Meme Coins Are Set For Explosive Rebound! Mind Of Pepe Combines The Best Of Both! In his latest video, crypto analyst ClayBro provided insights into the current state of the meme coin market, highlighting key factors that could shape investment decisions in the coming months. Despite the recent downturn across the sector, he pointed out that the search volume for both meme coins and AI Agent tokens is at an all-time high – a clear indication that investor interest remains strong despite short-term price fluctuations. However, ClayBro also acknowledged a concerning factor, as the Crypto Fear and Greed Index currently sits at 17, signaling an ‘Extreme Fear’ level. This suggests that market sentiment is deeply cautious, which often results in heightened volatility and hesitant buying behavior. That being said, he emphasized that meme coins have continued to perform well over the medium term, even after experiencing temporary corrections. Given this pattern, he believes that the current dip could present a strategic buying opportunity for investors looking to enter the market at a lower price point. ClayBro sees MIND of Pepe as a particularly interesting option for those seeking diversification within the meme coin space. Since MIND tokens are currently available at a fixed price via presale, it could present a potential entry point ahead of future exchange listings. How to Get Involved in the MIND Presale The MIND of Pepe presale is still ongoing, offering investors the chance to acquire tokens at an early-stage price of $0.003816 before prices rise in future rounds. Investors can participate in the presale through the official MIND of Pepe presale website, with payment options including Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), Tether (USDT), and Credit Cards. For added convenience, the token is also available via the Best Wallet app , which can be downloaded from Google Play and Apple App Store , providing an easy way to purchase, manage, and track MIND holdings. With exchange listings expected post-presale, MIND has the potential for significant long-term gains, possibly even reaching 100x returns if market conditions align favorably. However, as with all meme coins, high volatility remains a factor, and price predictions are never guaranteed. For investors interested in AI-driven meme coins, MIND of Pepe represents an intriguing opportunity to get involved in a project that is blending cutting-edge technology with blockchain innovation.

GOP Senator Bill Hagerty, one of the bill’s co-sponsors, said on March 10 that he introduced an update of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, which would go to a Banking Committee vote on March 13. He added that the updated bill saw bipartisan consultation. The bill is co-sponsored by Republican Senators Cynthia Lummis and Tim Scott, who is also chair of the Banking Committee chair, along with Democrats Kirsten Gillibrand and Angela Alsobrooks. “The updated version of the GENIUS Act makes significant improvements to a number of important provisions, including consumer protections, authorized stablecoin issuers, risk mitigation, state pathways, insolvency, transparency, and more,” Gillibrand said in a statement. Hagerty first introduced the bill in early February. It aims to bring issuers of US dollar stablecoins with market caps over $10 billion — currently only Tether ( USDT ) and Circle’s USDC ( USDC ) — under Federal Reserve regulations . Those under $10 billion could opt into state-level regulation. Web3 learning app EasyA co-founder Dom Kwok said on X that the latest version of the GENIUS Act, shared by FOX Business reporter Eleanor Terrett, gives “US-issued stablecoins a competitive advantage.” He added that the bill now holds foreign stablecoin issuers to “extra high standards” in areas such as reserve and liquidity requirements, money laundering checks and sanctions checks.

The Senate Banking Committee will have to vote to pass the bill and it will then be put to a full Senate floor vote where it could be debated. If it passes the Senate, it will head to the House. If the House doesn’t change the bill, then it will be sent to President Donald Trump to sign into law or veto.

This shift in market dynamics seems to be scary, revealing the excess dominance of the institutions over the markets. In the meantime, the token that once was called a ‘centralized token’ is now displaying disparity from the top two tokens. The XRP price remains still above a crucial barrier wherein a rebound could elevate the levels back above $2.8; otherwise, a major pullback seems to be imminent. Ever since President Trump officially approved the creation of a Bitcoin strategic reserve, the demand for an XRP reserve has also spiked. Besides, the speculation of the token becoming a U.S. reserve asset is also making huge noise, which may have kept the price above the bearish range. However, the token continues to trade around a crucial range while the bulls are utilizing all their energy to keep up the price above the barrier. Will the XRP price drop below $2 & reach $1.5 or rebound to rise above $2.5? As seen in the above chart, the XRP price has reached the neckline of a head and shoulder pattern. This suggests the rise of the bearish dominance against the bulls, as the supertrend has turned bearish regardless of the recent rebounds. On the other hand, the RSI has displayed a bullish divergence but remains below the descending trend line. Therefore, the XRP price is feared to break below the support to squeeze out all the selling pressure, as the bears have been constantly trying to drag the price below $2 since December 2024. Regardless of the price plunge, the XRP price remains under bullish influence as the market sentiment remains bullish. The token is the third largest crypto, which has been heavily benefited from Trump’s victory. After Hedera & Mantra, XRP has surged over 336%, leaving behind the other popular tokens. Now that the price is strongly holding support above $2, it suggests the trader’s sentiments to remain bullish regardless of the bearish pressure escalating over the markets. Hence, the XRP price is believed to consolidate for a while, followed by a bullish breakout above $2.5.",Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|MARKET|FIAT|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-11 05:54:06

Presales allow investors to buy tokens before they hit major exchanges, often at the lowest possible prices. With the right picks, early buyers can position themselves for high returns as these projects gain traction. Among the top crypto presales this month, BlockchainFX , Solaxy, and Frog Knox stand out as some of the most promising investments. BlockchainFX – The Multi-Asset Trading Revolution BlockchainFX ($BFX) is more than just another crypto exchange. It is the first-ever trading super app that allows users to seamlessly swap between crypto, stocks, forex, ETFs, and commodities without needing multiple platforms. This breakthrough in multi-asset trading could redefine how investors interact with financial markets. One of the standout features of BlockchainFX is its 70% revenue-sharing model, which redistributes trading fees back to its users. Rather than simply paying transaction fees, traders earn passive income in BFX and USDT just by using the platform. Additionally, BlockchainFX is introducing a high-limit BFX credit card, allowing users to spend their holdings at over 250 million merchants worldwide with up to $100,000 per transaction. With its presale currently live, BlockchainFX offers early investors the chance to acquire BFX tokens before mainstream adoption. Given its ability to bridge crypto and traditional finance, this could be one of the most significant crypto launches of 2025. Solaxy – The Future of Decentralized Energy Solaxy ($SLX) is tackling one of the biggest challenges in energy: decentralized, sustainable power solutions. Using blockchain technology, Solaxy enables users to invest in and profit from renewable energy projects worldwide. By tokenizing energy production, SLX holders gain fractional ownership of solar, wind, and hydroelectric power plants, earning dividends from the electricity they generate. As governments and corporations ramp up their commitment to clean energy, Solaxy is positioned to become a leading player in the green crypto movement. Investors looking for long-term sustainability projects with real-world utility should keep an eye on Solaxy’s presale. Frog Knox – The Next Big Meme Coin with Real Utility The meme coin space has seen explosive growth, but Frog Knox ($FNX) is taking things a step further by adding real utility to its ecosystem. While the project embraces the humor and viral appeal of meme culture, it also integrates DeFi staking, NFT rewards, and a play-to-earn gaming ecosystem to provide holders with real incentives beyond speculation. With the success of past meme coins like Dogecoin and PEPE, Frog Knox has the potential to capture mainstream attention while offering tangible benefits through its ecosystem. With limited presale availability, early investors could see massive returns if the project gains traction. March 2025: The Best Time to Invest in Crypto Presales Timing is everything in crypto, and March 2025 presents a unique opportunity to invest before the next wave of bullish momentum. The projects above each offer something distinct, BlockchainFX revolutionizes trading, Solaxy integrates blockchain with sustainable energy, and Frog Knox reinvents meme coins with utility. For investors seeking high-growth opportunities, these presales present some of the best chances to make money in the crypto market before they hit the big exchanges. Those who secure early allocations in these projects could be positioning themselves for major gains in 2025.

Cybersecurity group SpyoSecure said in a March 10 post to X that hacker group Dark Storm made a Telegram post taking credit for the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, which was posted by the group’s leader. “To anyone wondering why X (Twitter) was down, it was under attack by Dark Storm Team,” SpyoSecure said. Source: SpyoSecure The Telegram channel has since been deleted for violating the platform’s terms of service. Screenshots shared on X show them stating they “took Twitter offline,” alongside a screenshot of failed connection attempts from various global locations. Ed Krassenstein, a social media personality and co-founder of NFT marketplace NFTz.me, said in a March 10 post to X that he had also been investigating the attack and was in touch with Dark Storm’s leader, who again claimed they were behind it. “The reason he gives me for the attack is just a demonstration of our strength, with no political motives,” Krassenstein said. The Russian-backed pro-Palestinian hacker group Dark Storm has been active since 2023 and is known for targeting NATO countries. Platform owner Elon Musk confirmed the social media platform had been hit with a cyberattack preventing some users from accessing the site on March 10. He said in a March 10 interview with Fox Business’s Larry Kudlow he had a rough idea of where the IP address of the hackers originated. “We’re not sure exactly what happened but there was a massive cyberattack to try and bring down the X system with IP addresses originating in the Ukraine area.” Related: US Treasury sued for giving Elon Musk’s DOGE access to sensitive info It comes amid violence at Tesla facilities around the US as part of a broader “Take down Tesla” movement protesting Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which is taking the axe to many government departments. Musk told Kudlow that regardless of the protests, he still thinks they are “doing the right thing here” because DOGE is cutting spending to initiatives “very few taxpayers would agree make sense.” Tesla stock is also suffering. In the most recent trading session, Tesla is down over 15% to $222 per share. In the after-hours session, it’s down a further 3% to $215, according to Google Finance.

As a result, some people in the industry believe the government should prioritize clear crypto regulation over a Bitcoin reserve. Meanwhile, Michael Saylor’s Strategy is aggressively expanding its Bitcoin holdings by raising up to $21 billion for additional acquisitions. In Singapore, SGX is set to launch Bitcoin perpetual futures in 2025 to further integrate cryptocurrency into traditional finance. US Needs Policy Reform More Than a Bitcoin Reserve Donald Trump’s recent executive order establishing a national Bitcoin reserve left the cryptocurrency industry with mixed reactions. While some had high hopes for the initiative, several executives believe that regulatory clarity is a far more pressing issue for the sector. Many in the industry are still awaiting concrete guidelines on securities regulation, taxation, and stablecoins, and uncertainty continues to weigh on the market. The executive order was signed on March 6, and it fulfilled Trump’s campaign promise to create a Bitcoin reserve for the United States. However, instead of actively purchasing Bitcoin, the reserve will be made up of digital assets that were seized by law enforcement. This approach disappointed traders and investors, as it does very little to address the regulatory ambiguity that has plagued the industry for a long time. Max Giammario , CEO of Web3 artificial intelligence startup Kindred, shared his concerns over the lack of a clear roadmap for innovation, taxation, and institutional adoption, as markets need structured guidance rather than vague rhetoric. Bitcoin’s price action over the past week (Source: CoinMarketCap ) In the aftermath of the announcement, Bitcoin’s price dropped by roughly 13%, with altcoins suffering similar declines. The broader cryptocurrency market lost over $400 million in capitalization. Without immediate regulatory clarity, these losses could extend even further. Alvin Kan , Bitget Wallet’s chief operating officer, suggested that unless policies on stablecoins, ETFs, and institutional adoption become clearer, Bitcoin may continue to dominate the market at the expense of altcoins. Despite these concerns, there is still optimism in the industry. Trump maintained a pro-crypto stance, and his administration has appointed leaders who are considered favorable to digital assets. Some executives believe that these developments could lead to more constructive policies in the long run. Theodore Agranat , director of Web3 at Gunzilla Games, pointed out that the direction of US crypto policy under Trump is still a bit uncertain, but with key figures in influential positions, ongoing positive initiatives could emerge. For now, there is cautious optimism that future developments could provide the necessary framework to support long-term growth in the crypto sector. Strategy Ramps Up Bitcoin Accumulation While the US government will not actively buy Bitcoin for its reserve, the same cannot be said for Strategy. Michael Saylor’s Strategy is the largest public corporate Bitcoin holder, and is preparing to raise up to $21 billion in fresh capital to expand its Bitcoin reserves. The company announced on March 10 that it entered a new sales agreement that allows it to issue and sell shares of its 8% Series A perpetual strike preferred stock. The funds raised will be used for general corporate purposes, including potential Bitcoin acquisitions. Under the new agreement, which is dubbed the “ATM Program,” Strategy plans to sell shares in a disciplined manner over an extended period, taking into account market conditions, including the trading price and volume of the perpetual strike preferred stock. The company stated in its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that the proceeds from this initiative will be directed towards working capital and additional Bitcoin purchases. Strategy Bitcoin stats (Source: Strategy.com ) As of now, Strategy holds about 499,096 BTC, which is valued at approximately $41.2 billion. The firm acquired these holdings at an aggregate purchase price of $33.1 billion, with an average cost of $66,423 per Bitcoin. This aligns with its previously disclosed plans to raise up to $21 billion in equity and $21 billion in fixed-income securities over the next three years under its “21/21 plan” to accumulate even more Bitcoin. Since the beginning of 2025, Strategy publicly announced six Bitcoin acquisitions, and added about 52,696 BTC to its reserves since Jan. 13. This contributed to the company’s current BTC yield of 6.9% year-to-date. The firm also set an ambitious BTC yield target of 15% for 2025, after achieving an impressive 74% yield in 2024. The BTC yield metric reflects the percentage change in the ratio between the company’s Bitcoin holdings and its assumed diluted shares. Overall, the company has become one of the most influential players in the crypto sector since adopting its Bitcoin reserve strategy in August of 2020. This move paved the way for greater institutional Bitcoin adoption, and even inspired other firms like Tesla and Japan’s Metaplanet to follow suit. SGX to Launch Bitcoin Perpetual Futures in 2025 Singapore Exchange (SGX), which is the largest exchange group in Singapore, is preparing to introduce Bitcoin perpetual futures in the second half of 2025. The exchange wants to expand institutional market access by offering cryptocurrency futures that are tailored specifically for professional and institutional investors. A spokesperson from SGX stated that the company seeks to provide a trusted trading alternative, leveraging its Aa2 rating by Moody’s to establish credibility in the crypto derivatives market. Singapore Exchange HQ The launch of these Bitcoin perpetual futures is pending approval from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), with strict limitations in place to prevent retail investors from participating. Unlike traditional Bitcoin futures contracts, which require settlement at a predetermined date, perpetual futures offer continuous trading without an expiration date, making them a popular tool for traders looking to speculate on Bitcoin’s price movements. The introduction of perpetual Bitcoin futures on SGX coincides with Singapore’s growing influence in the cryptocurrency and blockchain sector. The MAS actively fostered a crypto-friendly regulatory environment, which led to a big increase in the number of licensed crypto firms in the country. This trend positioned Singapore as a leading global hub for digital asset trading and investment. SGX is not alone in its push for crypto futures trading in the region. In January of 2025, EDX Markets, a crypto asset firm backed by Citadel Securities, also announced its plans to offer crypto futures in Singapore. Meanwhile, in Japan, the Osaka Dojima Exchange is looking for regulatory approval to list Bitcoin futures, which, if granted, could make it one of the first traditional exchanges in Asia to handle these products. As institutional interest in cryptocurrency derivatives continues to rise, futures trading is becoming an increasingly popular trend in the industry.

Memecoin mania peaked when Donald Trump launched his own namesake token (TRUMP) on Jan. 18, shortly followed by his wife, Melania, who launched MELANIA on Jan. 20. “The launch of TRUMP and MELANIA marked the top for memecoins as it sucked liquidity and attention out of all the other cryptocurrencies,” said CoinGecko founder Bobby Ong on March 6. Both tokens surged following their launches but dumped in the days that followed.

There could be a causation here, as, for decades, the low-yielding yen propped up global asset prices. The ongoing rise in the Japanese yen may have had a hand in the recent risk aversion on Wall Street and in the crypto market. That said, the bullish positioning in the Japanese yen looks overstretched, with speculators holding record longs last week, according to the CFTC data tracked by MacroMicro . Such extreme bullish positioning, representing a collective belief in a continued move higher in the asset, sets the stage for disappointment, following, which a mass unwinding of longs unfolds, leading to a quick bearish reversal. In other words, the yen's rise could stall for now, offering relief to risk assets, including Nasdaq and bitcoin. ""We are now cautious on chasing further JPY strength, given stretched speculative positioning as well as strong dip-buying appetite from the domestic community,"" Morgan Stanley's G10 FX Strategy team said in a note to clients late Friday. Strategists explained that many Japanese investors use the Nippon Individual Savings Account (NISA) scheme to snap up foreign assets during risk-off, inadvertently slowing the pace of JPY appreciation. Additionally, the public pension system tends to go against the trend, rebalancing out of JPY assets. ""Indeed, such scenario happened in last August after a sharp appreciation of the JPY and the pronounced sell-off in equities,"" strategists noted. Let's see if history repeats itself, triggering a renewed risk-on sentiment for Nasdaq and bitcoin. The USD/JPY pair turned up following the July and early August slide to 140, eventually rising to 158.50 by January. BTC turned up as well from the early August crash to $50,000, rising to new record highs above $108,000 in January. At press time, bitcoin traded near $80,300, representing a month-to-date decline of nearly 5%, extending February's 17.6% slide. At one point early Tuesday, prices dipped to $76,800, according to CoinDesk data. Meanwhile, USD/JPY traded at 147.23, having put in a five-month low of 145.53 early Tuesday, TradingView data show. Temporary respite? While the stretched bull positioning and institutional flows suggest relief ahead, these factors may do little to alter the broader bullish outlook for JPY, which is backed by a narrowing U.S.-Japanese bond yield differential. So, risk asset bulls need to be vigilant for signs of volatility in the yen and the broader financial markets. The chart shows the spread between yields on the 10-year U.S. and Japanese government bonds. The spread has narrowed to 2.68% in a JPY-positive manner, reaching the lowest since August 2022. Plus, it has dived out of a macro uptrend, suggesting a major bullish shift in the JPY outlook.",Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|Nasdaq,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|FIAT|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-11 07:20:47

On-chain whale data signaled that a whopping 195,000 coins were sacked from crypto exchange giants as SOL price slammed around $120. As an upshot, bullish market sentiments orbiting the sixth-largest coin by market cap surfaced among traders and investors, with a potential $150 target next. Solana Whale’s Trade Move Stirs Market Optimism According to Lookonchain data on March 11, a Solana whale withdrew 195,000 coins from crypto exchange behemoths recently. Per the whale data, $23.2 million worth of coins were bought from top CEXs Bybit, OKX, and Gateio in the past 24 hours. This massive accumulation by a large-scale trader amid an ongoing market slump reflected strong confidence in the asset’s potential ahead. As a result, broader market sentiments reflect optimism about the asset’s long-term price prospects. Solana Whale’s ‘Buy-The-Dip’ Plan Notably, the broader crypto market currently faces immense pressure due to macro fears. Soon after Donald Trump’s new tariff saga, the chances of a recession in the U.S. rose to 40%. In turn, risk assets encountered a panic-stricken investor sentiment globally. Bitcoin price lost $80K, even touching a $76K multi-month low this Tuesday. Altcoins, including SOL, mirrored the broader slumping trajectory. However, the Solana whale’s decision to capitalize on the dip indicated a ‘buy-the-dip’ strategy, setting off optimistic waves among investors as it signals a recovery lies ahead. Rising Staking Fuels More Optimism Simultaneously, an X post by Onchain Lens on March 11 revealed that ‘Cumberland DRW’ staked 48,182 SOL, worth $5.72 million, recently. Coupled with the massive SOL whale accumulation, this data garners additional optimism, underscoring reduced token supply on exchanges. Overall, the whale data and staking saga reflected rising market interest in the asset’s potential, paving a bullish road for price. Can SOL Price Recover To Hit $150? As of press time, SOL price cracked slightly over 3% and exchanged hands at $123. The coin bottomed and peaked at $113.19 and $131.24 in the past 24 hours. Crypto market watchers anticipate a rising action ahead amid increased buying for the asset. Simultaneously, renowned market trader ‘Coinvo’ took to X, stating Solana is going to explode ahead. The trader cites a historical pattern, signaling that a bull run awaits as the coin mirrors its 2021 trend. Source: Coinvo, X On the other hand, Bitcoin OG ‘Lucky’ took to X, revealing that a tiny market movement could fuel SOL to above $150. The coin currently sees a strong demand zone between the $110-$127 range, per the analyst. Altogether, when coupled with the massive Solana whale accumulations, the odds of these bullish projections gained significant weight.

The general belief is that US President Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump is an American former president politician, businessman, and media personality, who served as the 45th president of the U.S. between 2017 to 2021. Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President decision to impose tariffs against China, Canada and Mexico has played a prominent role in the sudden collapse of these markets. A series of posts published by The Kobeissi Letter suggests that there exists another strong reason for the collapse of these markets. Read on for more details! Markets Have Lost $5.5 Trillion in Two Months On January 10, the total market cap of the crypto market was around $3.23T. On the same day, the S&P 500 index was at $5,828.54. Since then, the crypto market has slipped by at least 20.12%, and the S&P 500 by around 3.67%. As per The Kobeissi Letter, over the last 2 months, the S&P 500 and crypto have lost a combined $5.5 trillion of market cap. Since February 20 alone, the S&P 500 has lost $4.5 trillion in market cap. On February 20, the S&P market was at $6,133.58. Since then, the market has plummeted by approximately 8.46%. During the same period, the crypto market has slipped by no fewer than 18.86%. Trade War Is Just a Scapegoat According to The Kobeissi Letter, the markets were already aware about the possibility for the occurrence of a trade war. The recent shift in market sentiment has played a crucial role in the collapse of the markets. As of now, the Crypto Fear $ Greed Index stands at 24. On the same day, a year before, the index was at 82. On November 22, 2024, it touched a peak of 94. On the first day of 2025, the index was at 66. On February 27, it dropped as low as 10. This sudden shift from extreme greed to extreme fear triggered the sell-offs in the markets, suggest experts. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and XRP Price Prediction Today (For March 11) , Institutions Sold Before the Crash The Kobeissi Letter notes that hedge fund exposure to tech stocks hit a 22-month low before the decline. The YTD return of AAPL stands at -4.85, MSFT at -9.81%, NVDA at -20.34%, AVGO at -20.44% and ORCL at -10.71%.Reports suggest that institutional investors shorted Ethereum on February 9, just before crypto’s crash. On February 9, the ETH price was at $2,624.48. Since then, the Ethereum market has declined by at least 28%.In the last 24 hours alone, the ETH market has declined by approximately 8.1%. Importantly, reports highlight that the VIX index has surged by 70% in the last one month. In conclusion, the market crash is more about fear than fundamentals. Understanding shifts in sentiment can help traders stay ahead of market swings.

Key Support levels: $0.64, $0.45 Key Resistance levels: $0.90, $1.3 1. ADA Hovers Above Key Support After a very volatile period, ADA’s price settled on the key support at 64 cents. So far, this level has held well and managed to keep sellers at bay. Nevertheless, the momentum remains bearish with lower highs and lower lows. This could end up putting pressure on the key support again soon. Chart by TradingView 2. Sellers Dominate When Trump made its first announcement about the US Crypto Strategic Reserve, ADA shot up above $1 on the news that it will be included in such a reserve. However, since then, the price corrected in full and returned to it’s pre-pump levels. This indicates that the rally was just a temporary market speculation without long-term demand. Chart by TradingView 3. Weekly MACD Remains Bearish On the weekly MACD, nothing has changed for Cardano since the bearish cross from late January. Even the tweet from Trump did not change the current downtrend. This only shows that a reversal is still quite some distance away.

The S&P 500 also erased $1.4 trillion in market cap, marking its worst trading day since 2022. The widespread crash across risk assets was triggered by fears of a looming recession, with experts predicting a 40% chance that the US economy might enter a recession this year. Cryptocurrencies Price Prediction as US Recession Fears Spark Market Crash Investors are turning away from risk assets such as cryptocurrencies and stocks due to economic uncertainty. Yesterday, the S&P 500 market cap dropped by $1.4 trillion, marking its worst day of trading in two years. This index is now approaching a six-month low. Cryptocurrencies also saw a similar decline that caused $954M in total liquidations after Bitcoin price fell to $76,000 and Ethereum price fell to $1,800 for the first time since November 2023. Most top altcoins are also trading at multi-month lows. Crypto Liquidations This downtrend was triggered by the fear of a looming recession after predictions market Kalshi showed that the chances of a US recession have climbed to 40%. Because of these fears, traders are de-risking from risk assets like crypto and stocks and turning towards assets such as gold, which recently reached an all-time high. Chances of a US Recession Trump Fuels US Recession Rumors The markets also grew anxious after President Donald Trump failed to rule out the likelihood that the US economy could enter a recession in 2025. In an interview with Fox Business , Trump admitted that his economic policies, such as economic tariffs, would cause short-term turbulence. He stated, “There is a period of transition because what we’re doing is very big… We’re going to have a disruption, but we’re okay with that.” Last week, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell noted that despite the ongoing economic uncertainty, the US economy was still in a good place . Therefore, the Fed was not in a rush to trim interest rates to stimulate economic growth and avert a recession. “If the economy remains strong but inflation does not continue to move sustainably toward 2 percent, we can maintain policy restraint for longer,” Powell said. What’s Next For Cryptocurrencies? There is a mixed market sentiment on whether cryptocurrencies will recover after the recent crash. Analyst Ali Charts noted that after Bitcoin price fell below its 200-day moving average, the next key support level lies at $66,000. Without any bullish catalyst, and with recession fears still at play, BTC price could drop gradually until it hits this support. Bitcoin Mayer Multiple As Bitcoin price moves down, other cryptocurrencies are set to also decline. However, ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood noted that the recent downtrend was the crypto market discounting the final phases of a rolling recession. After this phase, the crypto market will experience a deflationary boom in the second half of 2025. As the market sentiment remains uncertain, Bitcoin price may face challenges holding the $80K support level. Ethereum could also accelerate its decline after hitting 2023 lows. This highlights a bearish price prediction for most cryptocurrencies.

Weekly network revenue on Solana hit an all-time high of $55.3 million in mid-January, driven by a boom in meme coin minting. However, that momentum has collapsed, with revenue plunging 93% to just $4 million last week—its lowest level since September, according to DeFiLlama data . Solana’s decentralized application (DApp) revenue has also taken a significant hit, dropping 86% from $238 million in January to $32 million last week. Solana’s DeFi TVL Sinks Nearly 50%, Dropping from $12B to $6.4B Meanwhile, total value locked (TVL) in Solana’s DeFi ecosystem has been cut nearly in half, falling from $12 billion to approximately $6.4 billion over the same period. The decline coincides with a sharp drop in meme coin trading activity, which accounted for 80% of Solana’s revenue, according to a March 5 report by VanEck. The Pump.fun trading platform, which fueled much of Solana’s memecoin craze, saw its daily revenue peak at $15 million in late January before plummeting 95% to $800,000 on March 7, per Dune Analytics data. The peak of the memecoin mania occurred in mid-January when Donald Trump launched his own token (TRUMP) on Jan. 18, followed shortly by Melania Trump’s MELANIA token on Jan. 20. The initial surge in interest pulled liquidity away from other cryptocurrencies, marking the high point of the memecoin frenzy, according to CoinGecko founder Bobby Ong. Since then, both tokens have collapsed. $TRUMP has plunged 86% from its peak, now trading at $10.50, while $MELANIA has lost 95% of its value, dropping to $0.71 in just seven weeks. The overall memecoin market cap has also suffered, falling 68% from a December high of $137 billion to just $44 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. The downturn has also impacted Solana’s price, which has fallen 58% from its mid-January all-time high of $293. The cryptocurrency dropped another 5% on the day, trading at $122 at the time of writing. Solana Community Debates Proposal to Overhaul SOL Tokenomics The Solana community is actively discussing a governance proposal , Solana Improvement Document (SIMD)-0228, which seeks to revamp the network’s tokenomics by introducing a dynamic, market-driven inflation model for SOL tokens. The proposal, authored by Multicoin Capital’s Tushar Jain and Vishal Kankani, along with Max Resnick, lead economist at Anza, aims to replace Solana’s fixed inflation schedule with a system that adjusts token emissions based on staking participation. Currently, Solana follows a fixed inflation schedule, starting at 4.6% annually and decreasing by 15% each year until stabilizing at 1.5%. It is worth noting that investment firms are moving swiftly with their Solana ETFs. Investment giant Franklin Templeton recently filed a registration for the Franklin Solana Trust in Delaware. The filing follows similar applications from Canary Capital and Grayscale, both of which have already been acknowledged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). VanEck was the first to propose a Solana ETF in June 2024 , prompting a series of filings from major asset managers.

Price is at a Key Support As long as XRP manages to hold above $2, its bullish uptrend remains intact. However, with each attempt by sellers to break this key level the chances of them succeeding increases. This is why buyers have to push the price higher and move it away from this level as soon as possible to maintain control. Chart by TradingView 3.

Such forecasts are not speculation, they stem from Mutuum Finance’s strong fundamentals, innovative use case, and growing investor demand. Mutuum Finance is also gaining more popularity as it is now progressing with its phase 2 across its ongoing presale program. The presale funding has already surpassed $2.7 million and the number of holders has already risen to 4,900. Aside from phase 2, it is also now over 75% sold out during high demand. Investors can purchase MUTM tokens at $0.015 since the subsequent price wave surge will push their value to $0.02. Investors purchasing Phase 2 will get 300% ROI from the launch price, where MUTM is set at $0.06. The project will reach an estimated value of $5. Mutuum Finance Presale Investors converge on Mutuum Finance because of its revolutionary decentralized finance (DeFi) lending solution based on decentralization that powers advanced financial services. The Mutuum Finance project displays strong growth by obtaining $2.7 million valuable funding from investors while gathering more than 4,900 participants to its financing scheme. Phase 2 tokens currently sell for $0.015, but investors must purchase during this period, as they should anticipate a 33.33% price increase that will finalize the early investment period. Users participating in the presale phase can achieve up to 300% investment gains since the token price will be set at $0.06 after presale completion. Mutuum Finance leads the DeFi sector expansion through its pioneering lending model that establishes a dominant market position. Revolutionizing Crypto Lending with a Dual-Model Approach The platform of Mutuum Finance utilizes P2C (Peer-to-Contract) and P2P (Peer-to-Peer) models through an advanced lending infrastructure to boost asset accessibility from both sides of the network. The P2C model allows users to put stablecoins into smart contract pools to gain passive income, through which platform users immediately access borrowing services. Smart contracts operate automatically to modify interest rates, which provides optimal return rates to lenders with reduced borrowing expenses. Through its P2P model, the system establishes direct lending relationships that exclude intermediaries to achieve full decentralization. Users manage all aspects of their negotiations on the platform to generate a more efficient and clear system, which lets borrowers and lenders personalize their loan terms through an improved user-powered borrowing process. Innovating Crypto Lending with Stability Mutuum Finance generates its stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain where security remains possible because of dollar reserves. Ethereum enables transaction security while maintaining resistance against algorithmic instability issues through its financial system. Mutuum Finance develops a next-generation decentralized finance system by linking robust infrastructure with contemporary lending models. The rapid adoption of DeFi markets motivates Mutuum Finance to provide flexible lending services and take advantage of the current market trends. Users find investment opportunities through Mutuum Finance because of its dedicated customer approach. The crypto lending market is experiencing swift growth which Mutuum Finance leads as one of its main proponents. Analysts are highly optimistic about Mutuum Finance (MUTM) because they forecast its price will reach $5 in 2025, which represents a 33,233% rise against its current value of $0.015. Paid investor demand, combined with strong fundamental strength and DeFi lending model innovation, creates a bullish market prediction. More than 4,900 investors came forward to participate in the presale events, which resulted in exceeding $2.7 million.

The ESM and ECB have teamed up to fast-track the rollout of a digital euro. The price of euro has crashed massively, dropping approximately 50% of its value since its launch. The European Union is becoming increasingly uneasy over U.S. President Donald Trump’s strong backing of digital assets, especially dollar-backed stablecoins. European finance officials worry this shift could undermine the euro’s monetary sovereignty and disrupt financial stability, particularly as the EU struggles with a weakening currency. Europe’s Response to Growing Crypto Threat Pierre Gramegna, Managing Director of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), expressed these concerns at a Eurogroup press conference on March 10. He noted the U.S. government’s supportive stance toward cryptocurrencies and stablecoins might allow American tech giants to build dominant payment systems in Europe. “ If this were to be successful, it could affect the euro area’s monetary sovereignty and financial stability, ” Gramegna warned, reiterating the EU’s urgency in launching the digital eur… The post EU’s Concern of Trump’s Pro-Crypto Policies To Undermine Euro Stability appeared first on Coin Edition .",Market|Market News|News|Donald Trump|Europe,EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coin Edition', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/7/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinquora,2025-03-11 07:30:00

Through its AI algorithms Ozak AI delivers optimized trading and data analytical solutions and decentralized platform applications that provide blockchain technology at scale with automatic control. The Ozak AI presale continues to capture investor attention through its promising figures that surpass $900,000 raised from the market. According to market analysts, Ozak AI tokens will reach $1 by 2025, as their current price stands at $0.003. The platform plans to extend its operations to healthcare and finance sectors in addition to logistics, which showcases its flexibility in operations beyond crypto trading. As an organization composed of skilled professionals operating within an innovative technological system Ozak AI seeks leadership status in the upcoming AI blockchain revolution. Market participants invested in the project because of promising return potential, while some analysts predict a 300x growth if the platform delivers its planned objectives successfully. Pi Coin’s Price Decline and Market Challenges Pi Network has lost a substantial amount of value in recent months after its unexpected cryptocurrency startup success. The value of the token reached $1.3340, thus dropping 55% from its peak value of $3 in February. The value of Pi Coin has decreased because token unlocks generate more supply, which leads to price reduction from dilution effects. A total of 100 billion Pi coins exist in circulation at present and the market has 7.22 billion tokens available for trading. This current year will see 188 million token releases, while the total sum of 1.4 billion tokens will enter circulation between 2027 and 2028. The growing supply has worried investors, which leads to an unfavorable forecast regarding token price stability. The cryptocurrency market across the board has caused negative effects on Pi Coin’s performance. While the cryptocurrency market loses value, its total market capitalization drops 3.65% to $2.75 trillion, and Bitcoin encounters downward pressure. The price of Pi Coin faced a decline due to market reactions toward significant political and economic U.S. events as market participants adjusted their portfolios based on industry transformations. Investment Outlook: Ozak AI vs. Pi Coin Potential investors need to evaluate the differences in market performance between Ozak AI and Pi Coin to make informed decisions. The structured AI-driven model of Ozak AI alongside its strategic presale approach, has gained investor attention because people foresee robust growth potential for the platform. Long term investors seeking potential blockchain investments should consider systems that integrate AI functions because the combination makes blockchain attractive. Ozak AI and Pi Coin stand in stark contrast with one another since Pi Coin exhibits high price volatility, and investors need to consider the potential impacts of supply dilution. Future token unlocks may create additional price fluctuations in the cryptocurrency which makes its value riskier. Ozak AI emerges as a favorable cryptocurrency choice among those who want to invest in AI-based blockchain platforms by delivering both a systematic framework and development potential.

Experts believe it can scale up to 1500x the $127.57 billion current XRP marketcap. Currently, RTX is at $0.0734 with over $13.8 million in funds and over 517 million tokens sold. The majority of meme tokens ride the excitement train, but Remittix aims to satisfy real demands by offering quick and affordable cross-border payments. In our next segment, we will see how Remittix did in such a short period of time and whether RTX will be a replacement for XRP in international finance surpassing XRP marketcap in no time. PayFi Advantage: Fast and Affordable Money Transfers Remittix (RTX) stands out among the money transfer services between countries. It is an enormous market valued at trillions of dollars annually. It is no longer necessary to wait for wire transfers or shell out very significant fees. It only takes approximately 24 hours to convert your crypto (such as BTC, ETH or others) to your currency in the area. Say you are a freelancer in Brazil with a customer in Canada; Remittix simplifies the process for the individual to receive a direct bank deposit. This simplicity is among the chief reasons RTX raised over $13.8 million in funding and sold over 518 million tokens. If Remittix can acquire big retail or payroll partners for which it can sell a lot, this will trigger very high price rises up to a multiple of approximately 1500. This will make the token market cap close to the big XRP market cap of $127.57 billion. Why 1500x Can Occur Crypto investors think Remittix (RTX) with its low price and high utility can go up to $1500x in worth. They’re comparing it with XRP, whose worth went up when banks were eager to use its payment technology for cross-border money remittances. RTX promises the same advantage of rapid money transfer between countries only for ordinary individuals like business owners and families, not banks. By locking team tokens in smart contracts, Remittix limits the chances of scams. Since most ordinary people will most likely be using it, the token price can go up much quicker than those with complex enterprise smart contracts or DeFi. While reaching the $127.57 billion market cap may be difficult, fans think the trillion-dollar remittance market can accomplish it with RTX as the go-to choice. RTX Figures for Growth At the center of Remittix (RTX) is a presale valued at over $13.8 million with over 518 million tokens sold. That is significant for a project with real use cases in the real world, as opposed to one with new technology or meme-based projects. Investors believe that when families, freelancers or business owners can see how easy RTX cross-border payments are, money will be sent in increasing exponential numbers quickly. Each new user would create more users in the pursuit of less expensive, faster deposits, a trend that will get the token market cap up to the level of XRP. The project will, however, have to make deals and grow in the right direction in order to reach its full potential for 1500x growth. Many are viewing the locked team tokens and audits as a signal the team is in it for the long term. Conclusion: $0.07 to $127.57 Billion, Is It A Fantasy or A Real Opportunity? Remittix (RTX) may equal or surpass the XRP market cap of $127.57 billion. RTX will benefit individuals in the same manner XRP benefited banks: by providing money transfers faster and at a reduced cost. Currently at $0.0734, it has gathered more than $13.8 million, so Remittix is beginning to make waves with a 1500 times return. How long it will endure in the real world will be the deciding factor on whether it can catch up with XRP marketcap. Ready to Give Remittix (RTX) a Go?

41468908,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=690716,1741678598,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/41468908.jpeg,Fintech executives push stablecoins at congress as Trump backs regulation,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/fintech-executives-push-stablecoins/,"Financial technology executives are gearing up to advocate using dollar-backed stablecoins to cut transaction costs for American consumers and businesses. They are also scheduled to testify at a pivotal congressional hearing on Tuesday as political momentum builds for regulatory legislation that could offer a clearer outline of the future of these digital assets. Charles Cascarilla, the chief executive officer of Paxos Inc., one of the largest stablecoin issuers, said in a prepared testimony, “A dollar on the blockchain could be transferred instantaneously, at virtually no cost, and could be held by anyone who had an internet connection and a smartphone.” Critics of the current financial system also point to high-fee services like ATMs, overdrafts, and wire transfer fees, which make it incredibly expensive for low-income individuals. Cascarilla characterized this system as a “regressive tax,” which creates financial disparities. Proponents of stablecoins argue that these digital tokens can eliminate those losses, make transactions cheaper, and open access to millions who do not meet the requirements to be part of the traditional payment system. However, despite their advantages, stablecoins do not offer the same regulatory protections found in traditional banking institutions. Unlike bank deposits, they do not have Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) coverage protection, so consumers could suffer sizable losses if an issuer fails. That concern has sparked speculation that the federal government could ultimately have to step in to clean up after a major stablecoin disaster—possibly at a steep cost to taxpayers. Stablecoin regulation interest is receiving support from both sides of Congress Interest in stablecoin regulation is growing in Congress, with a bipartisan tilt toward new legislation. Even President Donald Trump supports the move. He is positive about efforts to draw regulatory clarity for the industry, such as those at a White House crypto summit earlier this month. The Secretary of the Treasury, Scott Bessent, backed stablecoins and said they could help to ensure the US dollar remains the “dominant” currency in the world economy. Compared to the moves in the broader crypto market, stablecoins have seen a fairly rapid surge for some time. According to ARK Invest , an investment firm led by Cathie Wood, data shows that global transaction volumes crossed $15 trillion in 2024. Most US consumers who rely heavily on cards for a wide range of retail purchases do not inherently use stablecoins. However, they are widely used in digital and cross-border transactions; the evolution of the entire financial ecosystem will continue to become increasingly attractive. Stablecoins promise to be backed one stablecoin-to-one dollar on reserves and serve as a lock-in to the dollar as the world’s No. 1 reserve currency. This has led policymakers to consider how the industry should best be regulated to protect financial stability while supporting innovation. Senate and House of Representatives bills have the common goal of regulating the stablecoin. The issuers in the introduced model would be accountable to federal or state regulators. They would be mandated to hold reserves big enough to cover all the redeemable cryptocurrency for money and to abide by the anti-money laundering regulations and other financial reports. The goal, however, is to pen regulations that protect consumers without inhibiting the industry’s growth. National finance executives like Stripe Chief Executive Patrick Collison and head of digital assets at The Bank of New York Mellon Corp Caroline Butler will also join Charles Cascarilla. All of them will appear in the House Financial Services Committee hearing, which has been reviewing stablecoin bills and has the power to determine the future of digital payments. This uptick in regulatory scrutiny has become more pronounced in part due to the involvement of some of the largest players in the industry, including Tether and Circle, known for managing billions of dollars of transactions daily. Stablecoins may not have taken over brick-and-mortar merchants as the primary payment method for goods and services, with fiat currency still being the most commonly accepted, but online commerce, remittances, and digital asset trading have adopted them greatly. One of the many points of contention in the legislative talks is whether stablecoin issuers would be required to register in the US. Such a mandate may disadvantage offshore issuers, such as El Salvador-based Tether, while helping competitors based on US soil, such as Circle. Policymakers also consider imposing higher capital requirements to ensure that the reserves backing stablecoins remain strong during financial stress. Congress weighs stablecoin regulations amid banking concerns and industry pushback Banks have traditionally held a monopoly over financial transactions, including deposits, loans, and payment settlements. With the emergence of stablecoins, banks feel threatened and have spoken out against them as competition for deposits and payment processing services. If stablecoins capture market share, they might drain revenue from banks dependent on transaction fees and interest-bearing deposits. Another is the lack of a central backstop for stablecoins. If the industry grows large enough to become systemically important, one big failure could ripple through the financial system. Some policymakers have proposed that a central bank digital currency (CBDC) issued by the Federal Reserve would offer a safer alternative to privately issued stablecoins. However, the cryptocurrency industry and its advocates on Capitol Hill have fought the proposal, arguing that a digital dollar supported by the Fed would snuff out competition and destroy innovation. They have introduced a bill that would ban the Federal Reserve from issuing a CBDC. Tethered before the House Financial Services Committee and its Chair Patrick McHenry, the mainstay has focused legislation around stablecoins, notably, the Lummis-Gillibrand legislation , contrasted by bipartisan support from Senators Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) and Bill Hagerty (R-TN). A Senate aide said that the Senate Banking Committee would meet to discuss and vote on legislation covering stablecoins, potentially as soon as Thursday.

The controversy highlights growing dissatisfaction within the developer community, with some arguing that Base is prioritizing hype-driven tokens over serious blockchain innovation. The backlash began when Base publicly endorsed GrokCoin, a new token linked to Elon Musk’s AI chatbot, Grok. The post on X praised the project’s trading mechanisms and AI-driven wallet, which had already generated over $200,000 in fees. However, this move angered many builders who have spent months working on projects without receiving similar recognition from Base. A prominent developer, Kawz , voiced his frustration, claiming that despite dedicating significant effort to his Base-based app, he was never acknowledged by the platform. Meanwhile, GrokCoin, launched by a few individuals with limited details, received immediate attention. His sentiments were echoed by others in the community, who criticized Base’s selective promotion and argued that the platform is alienating talented developers. Another blockchain community member, FloBro , called out Base’s approach, stating that the platform fails to support builders while favoring select projects that cater to speculation rather than technological advancement. He suggested that this strategy is one reason why Base has struggled to create a strong meme coin trend compared to other blockchains. Despite the criticism, some community members defended Base’s promotion of GrokCoin. Shazam, another developer, explained that GrokCoin was not created arbitrarily. The token launch required users to send 5 million BNKR tokens to an AI-controlled wallet, allowing Grok’s algorithm to generate the new coin. He argued that if GrokCoin’s connection to Elon Musk gains traction, it could bring widespread attention to Base and the Ethereum ecosystem. The debate underscores a deeper conflict within the blockchain space: the tension between serious developers working on long-term projects and the hype-driven culture of meme coins and speculative tokens. While some believe that high-profile tokens like GrokCoin can attract attention and new users to the platform, others argue that neglecting established builders risks alienating the very people who contribute to the blockchain’s long-term success. Base’s leadership is now under pressure to clarify its stance on project promotion. The platform’s future credibility may depend on how it balances community engagement, project visibility, and the broader adoption of meaningful blockchain applications.",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-11 07:40:26

This sudden downturn has affected hundreds of thousands of traders, with long positions suffering the biggest losses. Bitcoin and Ethereum have taken the hardest hits, falling to their lowest levels in months, as investors panic amid worsening market conditions. A significant factor behind the sharp drop is the movement of large amounts of cryptocurrency by major players. Mt. Gox , the once-dominant exchange still settling debts with creditors, transferred tens of thousands of Bitcoin, triggering fears of a broader sell-off. Additionally, an Ethereum whale , inactive for months, deposited a massive amount of ETH into Kraken, further adding to the market turmoil. Another major holder offloaded a large amount of ETH at a significant loss, likely in an attempt to prevent forced liquidation. Adding to the market instability, political uncertainty has also played a role. Comments from Donald Trump about an impending economic downturn have rattled both traditional and crypto markets. His statement about potential ""disruption"" has fueled fears of an approaching recession, which sent shockwaves across the financial sector. As a result, both stock prices and crypto valuations tumbled, erasing the gains made following the latest U.S. monetary policy update. Bitcoin's steep decline has sparked concerns that further losses could be ahead. The leading cryptocurrency briefly touched a multi-month low before slightly recovering, but analysts warn that unless buying pressure returns, the trend may continue downward. Ethereum has also been hit hard, plunging to its lowest point since late 2023, marking a sharp reversal from its previous upward momentum. Crypto traders have been caught off guard by the rapid liquidations. Many had placed bullish bets expecting the market to continue its rally, only to be wiped out as prices dropped. The current situation highlights the risk of overleveraged positions in highly volatile markets. As prices fell, cascading liquidations further fueled the downward spiral, forcing traders to exit their positions at a loss. Meanwhile, whales and institutional players continue to move large sums of digital assets, suggesting uncertainty about the market’s near-term direction. Transfers worth hundreds of millions of dollars have been tracked, showing that major investors may be adjusting their portfolios in response to the volatility. While some view these moves as normal market activity, others fear they indicate further declines ahead. Despite the turmoil, some traders see an opportunity. Historically, large corrections have been followed by strong recoveries, and long-term investors may take advantage of the lower prices. However, the market remains highly unpredictable, with external factors such as regulatory developments and macroeconomic conditions playing a crucial role in shaping future trends. For now, the crypto space remains on edge, with traders watching closely to see if prices stabilize or if another wave of sell-offs will push valuations even lower. The coming days will be crucial in determining whether this is just a temporary correction or the start of a prolonged downturn.",,EN,0,0,MARKET|ETH|BUSINESS|BTC|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-11 07:43:52

Bitcoin continued its downtrend despite MicroStrategy’s new capital raise , while Trump’s policy moves and a recent White House crypto summit failed to boost market sentiment. Despite the downtrend, Altcoin Daily is doubling down on Bitcoin and select altcoins, urging investors to resist market fear, which has dropped to its lowest level. In a recent video, the Altcoin Daily host reminded viewers not to be afraid of the ongoing market crash. According to the analyst, the next 15 to 30 days could be life-changing as strategic accumulation happens behind the scenes. Echoing a similar sentiment, Matt Hougan, the Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, recently expressed strong confidence in the altcoin market, stating that we are entering a “ Golden Age ” for crypto beyond Bitcoin. As the market gains momentum, investors closely watch top altcoins that could lead the charge in this cycle. Analysts warn investors about selling the quality assets and why they think these altcoins will make you a millionaire. Here Are Six Altcoins to Think About During This Dip. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum (ETH) remains the dominant force among altcoins. With Ethereum’s upcoming Dencun upgrade , scalability is expected to improve, benefiting layer-2 solutions . Analysts believe ETH is gearing up for a major rally, especially with staking on the rise. If ETH clears resistance at $3,500, a surge toward $4,000 could be in play. However, the broader market movement remains key to its breakout potential. Solana (SOL) Solana (SOL) is the comeback kid after a turbulent 2023. Solana has regained momentum with increased activity in its DeFi and NFT ecosystem. SOL is trading near a crucial resistance level of $120, and a breakout could see it climb to $150. Analysts highlight strong institutional interest, but network reliability remains a possible concern. XRP XRP remains a focal point due to its ongoing battle with the SEC . While regulatory uncertainty persists, Ripple’s global expansion and banking partnerships keep XRP relevant. A move past $0.80 could trigger a run toward $1, but traders remain cautious about potential regulatory roadblocks. Cardano Cardano (ADA) continues to build with a focus on real-world utility. Its recent smart contracts and DeFi advancements make it an attractive long-term play. A successful breakout above $0.70 could indicate a strong bullish wave . Dogecoin (DOGE) DOGE continues to be a trader’s favorite, with Elon Musk’s influence still playing a role in its volatility. If DOGE can break past $0.10, momentum could drive it toward $0.15. Meme coins remain speculative, but DOGE’s longevity in the market keeps it alive. Avalanche Avalanche (AVAX) has gained traction due to its high-speed transactions and institutional partnerships. With growing adoption in traditional finance, AVAX is positioned well for future growth . AVAX needs to maintain support above $40 to sustain bullish momentum, with analysts setting a target of $50 if the volume picks up. Buy When There’s Blood in the Streets! Right now, the market is deep in the red, but savvy investors see it as a buying opportunity. Many new investors panic-sell during dips, but history shows that those who hold through volatility often see the biggest gains. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

A glimmer of hope has emerged as lawyer Fred Rispoli unveiled a crucial date that marks a significant turning point for the XRP lawsuit settlement. The lawyer asserts that the lawsuit will witness a major development before this critical deadline. Lawyer Unveils XRP Lawsuit’s Crucial Deadline: Know More In a recent X post , legal expert Fred Rispoli shared insights on the potential resolution of the XRP lawsuit. According to Rispoli, the Ripple vs SEC case may finally reach its conclusion or witness significant progress before Ripple’s appellate brief submission on April 16, 2025. As Rispoli pointed out, while there is no official requirement or timeline dictating this outcome, it’s reasonable to expect some movement in the XRP lawsuit before this crucial date. Bringing a sense of hope to XRP enthusiasts, Rispoli wrote on X, “Let’s keep an eye on it…and hope.” XRP Lawsuit Resolution in April: Uncertainty Remains Despite Fred Rispoli’s statement, the community remains doubtful about the conclusion of the Ripple lawsuit. While experts, including Jeremy Hogan and MetaLawMan, have predicted a potential delay in the settlement, the April deadline still hangs in balance. Despite rumors of a swift conclusion, attorneys Hogan and MetaLawMan cautioned that complexities, including Judge Torres’ injunction and the $125 million penalty, would likely delay the XRP lawsuit’s resolution. However, MetaLawMan predicted a settlement before April 16 echoing Rispoli’s recent statement. As uncertainty looms, a community member responded to Rispoli’s post. He stated, “If nothing happens in April. Something will happen in May. If nothing happens in May. June is the month. And if not. July for sure.” The thread on X expressed confidence that the XRP lawsuit settlement will occur in the near future, with a guaranteed resolution by July at the latest. In response to the post, Rispoli stated in a playful manner, “Surely you won’t deny August as the month?!?” Though playful, Rispoli’s comment subtly underscored that the XRP lawsuit settlement cannot extend beyond September. Ripple vs SEC Lawsuit End: What To Expect? Notably, as pointed out by Jeremy Hogan and MetaLawMan, the legal complications surrounding the XRP lawsuit will possibly delay its resolution. However, Fred Rispoli dismissed those discussions, addressing the SEC’s excuses cowardly. He posited that the Ripple vs SEC settlement is simple and possible. There’s speculation that the SEC will withdraw its appeal as early as March, paving the way for a potential resolution, while the injunction matter is dealt with subsequently. However, it needs to be seen how the SEC will handle the case and how it will impact the prolonged XRP lawsuit.

Meanwhile, a significant negative impact has also been seen in the crypto space, with Bitcoin continuing to trade under extreme bearish pressure. In the early trading hours, the price slipped to $76,600 in the times when it has been adopted by a U.S. strategic reserve. On the other hand, the trading volume has halved ever since the price failed to rise above $100K, which suggests a massive drop in the trader’s interest. What’s Next—Is the Bitcoin Bear Market Begun? The spot markets have been contributing to the volatility of the token, while the future market is considered to shed light on the price movements in the long term. Even if the spot volume drops, the volume in the futures remains elevated. Interestingly, the volume in both cases has dropped, suggesting the traders have become apathetic. Moreover, the future open interest has also dropped significantly since the last week of February, which substantiates the claim. Secondly, the transaction count has been dropping consistently ever since the BTC price began to escalate in November 2024. This suggests the rise in the institutional involvement or the possibility of carrying out more large transactions, as the drop in the transaction count implies the drop in the trading activity of the retailers. With this, the volatility has been decreasing, which is not good for a healthy price action. Both of the above on-chain indicators suggest a rise in the dominance of the institutions through a rise in the ETF holdings. The rise in ETF accumulation leads towards a rise in BTC value, while a drop impacts the price negatively. This suggests the impact of retail trading has been slashed to a large extent, and as a result, these traders usually turn as scapegoats during massive, long liquidations. What’s Next? Is BTC Heading Back to Fresh Lows? Since the price faced a rejection from the ATH, it has been constantly forming lower highs and lows. This suggests that the bulls have failed to reclaim their dominance, and as a result, every rebound is followed by a huge pullback. Currently, the price has displayed a bullish divergence, but it is expected to be short-lived as the Puell Multiple has remained neutral since the November breakout. The indicator considers Bitcoin miners and their revenue. If the indicator drops to the lower green zone, it indicates the start of a bull run, as it happened back in 2018 and 2021. Currently, the levels are stuck between 0.98 and 1.41 around the average, which suggests the markets are stuck within a strong consolidation phase. After losing the crucial support zone around $85,000, the price appears to have lost another pivotal support at $80,400. Therefore, with this, Bitcoin has completed a parabolic pullback, which could drag the levels lower. Hence, the BTC price continues to remain under bearish influence.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,TRADING|BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS|FIAT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-11 07:46:58

Initially proposed in February, this bipartisan legislation now includes additional provisions to address global concerns and improve oversight while maintaining a focus on fostering innovation. The revised bill reflects feedback from industry leaders and policymakers, introducing measures that could significantly impact both domestic and international stablecoin markets. One of the most significant changes is the expansion of regulations for stablecoins issued overseas . The updated bill mandates that the Secretary of the Treasury must establish agreements with other countries that have similar regulatory standards. These agreements will set clear requirements for reserve management, supervision, anti-money laundering protocols, and compliance with sanctions. The goal is to enhance the global stability of stablecoins and ensure smooth cross-border transactions. This move also aims to protect US interests by aligning foreign-issued stablecoins with US regulations. The bill sets a strict two-year deadline for finalizing these international agreements. The legislation also expands the definition of ""Comptroller-regulated entities"" , which now includes federally approved nonbank stablecoin issuers and other authorized financial institutions. This adjustment gives regulators greater control over the entities permitted to issue stablecoins, ensuring they meet the required legal and financial standards. The goal is to create a structured environment where only compliant organizations can participate in the growing stablecoin sector, ultimately strengthening investor confidence and market stability. Another major aspect of the revised GENIUS Act is the inclusion of strict compliance measures for stablecoin issuers . Under the new rules, issuers must have the capability to comply with legal orders that require blocking, freezing, or seizing stablecoin assets. This means that if authorities demand action against a particular account or transaction, stablecoin issuers must have the technology and processes in place to enforce these legal directives. Additionally, issuers of foreign stablecoins will not be allowed to operate in the US unless they meet all the requirements outlined in the bill. Senator Hagerty emphasized that stablecoins could play a critical role in strengthening financial efficiency and boosting demand for US Treasuries. He stated that this bill ensures a balance between regulatory clarity and market innovation , reinforcing the US as a leader in the global crypto industry. Senator Gillibrand echoed this sentiment, noting that the updates address key areas such as consumer protections, risk management, transparency, and legal oversight. The timing of this bill is critical as discussions around cryptocurrency regulation continue to gain traction in the US. The Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs has scheduled a review session for the bill on March 13, 2025. This will be a pivotal moment in determining how stablecoins are regulated in the future and whether the GENIUS Act can successfully bridge the gap between financial innovation and legal oversight. With the expansion of global cooperation, increased compliance measures, and a clear regulatory framework for issuers, the GENIUS Act represents a major step toward integrating stablecoins into the US financial system. However, questions remain about how the new rules will affect existing projects and whether foreign issuers will be willing to adapt to US regulations . As lawmakers continue to debate the bill, the crypto industry will be watching closely to see how these changes impact the broader digital asset landscape.",,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET|BUSINESS|FIAT|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-11 07:47:32

Marking this level as resistance, it is now on the verge of breaking lower as the supply level increases. Since Bitcoin fell below $100k in January, the market speculation and sentiment for bull run came to a halt as it continued to turn weak daily. Unfortunately, the crypto supplied heavily after a month’s consolidation and the price collapsed into the $78k range in late February. That caused serious panic and fear in the space, but the asset sharply bounced back from that range and retraced to the $95k level after two days of trading. A quick dump from that retracement level brought selling pressure back in the market, and the bears regained control after failing to push higher last week. Crossing into this week on a serious bearish note, the price appears very weak on the day as it approaches a crucial support line. Having posted a substantial loss in the past five days, things might get worse if the leading crypto breaks below the previous monthly low. This low coincides with the crucial support line forming since August 2024. A breakdown there could crash the asset heavily into the $70k range before taking a short break. Currently, no room for the bulls. BTC’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview The previous monthly $78,252 low is considered a key support level for a breakdown. Losing it should dip the price to $73,620 and $69,500. Towards the upside, the $85,120 level serves as resistance, along with the $91k and $95k levels. If Bitcoin managed to retake them, we would consider a bullish move. But for now, the bears have taken over. Key Resistance Levels: $85,120, $91,000, $95,000 Key Support Levels: $78,258, $73,620, $69,500 Spot Price: $80,508 Trend: Bearish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

This move is expected to overturn what industry leaders have called Operation Choke Point 2.0 , a set of restrictions that have made it difficult for crypto banks to operate within the traditional financial system. By lifting these barriers, Trump's order could reshape the digital asset landscape in the United States, providing new opportunities for crypto-friendly financial institutions. The initiative is linked to a broader effort to remove policies that were originally introduced to target high-risk industries, such as payday lenders and firearm dealers, but later expanded to include cryptocurrency firms. Many in the industry argue that these restrictions unfairly blocked crypto businesses from accessing essential banking services. Trump’s order is expected to direct regulatory agencies to change their stance, ensuring that legitimate crypto firms can secure the same financial services as other businesses. One of the most significant potential changes is the push to grant Federal Reserve master accounts to crypto banks. These accounts allow financial institutions to conduct transactions directly with the Federal Reserve , providing a crucial link between the crypto industry and traditional banking. Under the Biden administration, banks such as Custodia faced repeated denials when applying for these accounts, effectively cutting them off from the larger financial system. If Trump’s order succeeds, crypto banks could gain full access to these services, reducing their reliance on intermediaries. While this move is being welcomed by many in the crypto sector, it is expected to face resistance from regulatory bodies. The Federal Reserve operates independently and is not obligated to follow White House directives. This means that even if the executive order is signed, its impact may depend on how the Fed and other financial agencies respond. Some experts predict that central bank officials could push back against the changes, arguing that they need to maintain control over financial stability and risk management. This order would be Trump’s third major crypto-related executive action since returning to office. His first order established a Presidential Working Group focused on digital asset markets, while his second order created a US Bitcoin reserve. However, despite these moves, the broader crypto market has remained volatile. Some industry leaders have expressed frustration, saying that while Trump’s actions appear pro-crypto, they have yet to significantly improve market sentiment. The timing of this executive order is particularly important as the crypto industry navigates a period of uncertainty. Bitcoin and Ethereum prices have recently dropped, with some analysts pointing to broader economic concerns as a key factor. Trump's latest policies, including new tariffs on China , Mexico, and Canada, have created instability in traditional markets, leading some investors to pull funds from crypto-backed financial products. This has added pressure to an already shaky market, making it unclear whether the executive order will be enough to restore confidence among traders. Despite these concerns, the announcement of Trump’s order has reignited debate over the future of cryptocurrency regulation in the US. Supporters argue that providing clearer banking access to crypto firms will encourage innovation and position the US as a leader in digital finance. Critics, however, worry that reducing oversight could lead to greater risks, particularly if banks are forced to process transactions for companies with unclear financial practices. The next steps will depend on how quickly Trump moves to implement the order and how financial regulators react. If the executive action successfully pushes agencies to revise their policies, it could mark a turning point for the crypto industry. However, if resistance from the Federal Reserve slows down implementation, the order may have little immediate effect. Either way, Trump's push to end crypto debanking policies is a major development that will shape the conversation around digital asset regulation in the coming months.",,EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|BTC|REGULATION|ASIA,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-11 07:50:30

Shiba Inu showed wild gains and strong community support in 2021 and has since failed to meet up with that. Today, some experts claim that a new PayFi project with a highly successful presale may reach similar heights. Investors are calling it one of the best cryptos to buy. Its current DeFi coin price is very low, giving early backers a solid chance at high returns. Shiba Inu : A Token Known for Its Explosive Rally Shiba Inu has made headlines before with its dramatic price surge in 2021. The Shiba Inu price once soared to legendary levels. Many investors remember how Shiba Inu captured the imagination with a rally that seemed almost unbelievable. However, Shiba Inu faces challenges such as network congestion and high transaction costs. These issues limit its ability to reach new heights despite its vibrant community. SHIB has gone up by 3.20% to around $0.00001178 over the past 24 hours but experts say it is not sustainable. Shiba Inu price is expected to be stable around that price and ultimately dip by just -1.77% and reach $0.00001209 by April 9. The history of Shiba Inu serves as a reminder of what can happen when a token catches fire. The Shiba Inu price continues to be a topic of discussion among investors, who hope the token can recover its lost glory. Yet, even the best rallies need strong fundamentals to last.

The rule, introduced under former SEC Chair Gary Gensler , aimed to redefine what qualifies as an exchange by including certain communication protocols . Critics argued that the broad wording could have unintentionally regulated platforms that weren’t designed to be under SEC control. Now, acting Chair Mark Uyeda has moved to withdraw the proposal, signaling a major shift in the agency’s regulatory stance. This decision aligns with broader changes happening at the SEC under new leadership appointed by President Donald Trump . In recent weeks, the agency has also dropped at least six enforcement cases against major crypto companies, including actions targeting Kraken, Coinbase, Robinhood, and MetaMask . This suggests a significant easing of regulatory pressure, which had been a point of contention for crypto industry leaders and investors. Alongside these rollbacks, the SEC Crypto Task Force , now led by Commissioner Hester Peirce , is adopting a more collaborative approach to digital asset regulation. The task force, which includes experts like Richard Gabbert, Michael Selig, Taylor Asher, and Sumeera Younis , has announced a series of industry discussions. These “Spring Sprint Toward Crypto Clarity” roundtables will begin on March 21 , providing a platform for policymakers, industry leaders, and legal experts to address regulatory challenges and discuss the future of compliance in the crypto space. With these developments, the SEC appears to be stepping away from its aggressive enforcement stance under Gensler and instead focusing on engagement and clarity . This shift is expected to have significant implications for how crypto businesses operate in the U.S., potentially paving the way for a more open and innovation-friendly regulatory environment .

If that happens, the October 2023 surge level of $1,600 will be the key target range to watch for a test. A strong hold above this important level could trigger a brief consolidation phase before breaking lower. Whichever way, Ethereum will likely lose this key level, considering the past months of reductions. It appeared to end the bullish cycle as it slowly gathered momentum for a major crash on a long-term scale. ETH’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview Retaking the $2,076 level could bring a retest at last week’s $2,310 high. Right above this high lies the $2,550 level, marked as the monthly high. If by chance ETH reclaims it, we may see a slight market structure shift. But from the look of things, Ethereum will likely go more bearish, and it may navigate the $1,904 support soon. The next support levels to watch below it are $1,750 and $1,640 – drawn from the October 2023 levels. Key Resistance Levels: $2,076, $2,310, $2,550 Key Support Levels: $1,904, $1,750, $1,640 Spot Price: $2,036 Trend: Bearish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

This has resulted in a 6% fall to $2.6 trillion as all post-US election gains have now been wiped out. Ethereum has taken the brunt of the fall, losing a whopping 16% over 12 hours as it fell from around $2,140 to just below $1,800. Moreover, ETH is struggling to recover and was trading at $1,860 at the time of writing. ETH Death? The last time Ethereum traded below $1,800 was in October 2023, when it was slowly emerging from the two-year-long bear market. There is solid support at current levels, which must be held to prevent the asset from tanking back to bear market lows following the formation of what appears to be a double-top chart pattern. Analysts have warned that if support here is lost, ETH could fall as low as $1,200 . Ethereum is currently down a painful 62% from its all-time high in 2021, and the ETH/BTC ratio – which is a measure of the price of ETH in terms of Satoshis – is at its lowest level since December 2020, having fallen to 0.023 today, according to Tradingview. Only Dogecoin (DOGE) had heavier losses than Ethereum in the crypto top twenty today, with the memecoin melting by 11%. It does beg the question of who would be selling ETH at $2,000 and the answer appears to be whales that are trying to avoid being liquidated, according to Lookonchain. Needless to say, the Ethereum derision and FUD had escalated to new heights on Crypto Twitter as traders and investors licked their wounds. Ethereum Testnet Attacked The ETH angst has been exacerbated by problems with Pectra testing and an unknown attacker sending zero-token transfers, causing empty blocks. On March 9, Ethereum developer Marius van der Wijden said the issue had been fixed: “We suspected that the attacker was reading some of our chats, so we decided not to publicize the fix, but only update a few nodes that we controlled in order to get more full blocks on the network,” The post Ethereum Double Trouble: ETH Prices Fall Below $1,800 Price Crash Amid Testnet Attack appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|ETHBTC|ETHUSD|Ethereum|Ethereum (ETH) Price,EN,0,0,ETH|TRADING|MARKET|DOGE|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-03-11 07:54:43

The intense pain in the stock market has trickled into the crypto market amid the ongoing U.S.-led tariff wars. Moreover, more than $950 million was liquidated in the crypto market during the past 24 hours, mostly involving long traders, thus escalating the odds of a long squeeze. Pi Coin Price Prediction Following the launch of the Open Mainnet, Pi Coin has been subjected to the crypto market forces in the past few weeks. The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $15.4 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of around $535 million, dropped over 24 percent in the past seven days to trade about $1.38 on Tuesday, March 11, during the mid-London session. From a technical analysis perspective, Pi Price has confirmed a reversal pattern after closing below the neckline of a head and shoulders (H&S) formation in the past two days. In the four-hour time frame, Pi Coin has been forming a bearish continuation pattern as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) continues to signal bearish divergence. In the near term, Pi Coin will likely drop another 15-20 percent towards the support level of around $1.16. The short-term bearish sentiment will be invalidated if Pi Coin consistently closes above $1.77 in the coming weeks. Future of Pi Network The Pi Network has grown to a vast network of over 60 million users in the past years, largely due to its mobile mining infrastructure compared to the energy-intensive mining process of Bitcoin, Dogecoin (DOGE), and Litecoin (LTC). With the rising adoption of decentralized financial (DeFi) protocols, the Pi Network is keen to build utility-driven web3 projects to actively engage the community. As a result, the decisions made by the core team in 2025 will significantly influence the fate of the Pi Network in the coming years. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

A recent interview with President Donald Trump, in which he hinted at the possibility of a recession, has further unsettled investors. Crypto Market Plummets: XRP, Solana, And Cardano Follow Bitcoin’s Downtrend Bitcoin, the flagship cryptocurrency, has fallen nearly 4% in the last 24 hours, dropping toward the $79,000 mark—a level not seen since mid-November. Ethereum (ETH), has taken a more significant hit with a 10% drop toward $1,860, price not seen since August. Other established cryptocurrencies are also feeling the strain; XRP has declined by 4%, Solana (SOL) by 7%, and Cardano (ADA) by 8% as market participants continue to retreat from riskier assets. The backdrop to this volatility includes the continuous aggressive tariff policies imposed by the new President Donald Trump administration towards countries like Canada, China, and Mexico. Related Reading: Bitcoin Slips Under 200-Day Moving Average – Will The Downtrend Continue? These actions have sparked fears of a trade war, which could exacerbate inflation and increase the cost of imported goods. As a result, investors are gravitating toward safer investments, steering clear of the notoriously volatile cryptocurrency market. In a Fox News interview over the weekend, Trump acknowledged that the aggressive tariff strategy could lead to a recession, describing the country as entering a “period of transition.” This commentary has raised alarms among investors, particularly as Trump did not rule out the possibility of a recession occurring this year. Jake Ostrovskis, an over-the-counter trader at Wintermute, noted that the former president emphasized the likelihood of “short-term economic pain,” amplifying market anxieties. Diminished Risk Appetite And Fed Rate Outlook Adding to the uncertainty is the recent letdown regarding the White House’s plans for a national crypto reserve. Many in the crypto community had anticipated that Trump’s proposal would involve substantial government purchases of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, potentially stimulating demand and boosting prices. However, investors were disappointed when it was revealed that the government would refrain from making additional crypto purchases and would only retain cryptocurrencies seized from illegal activities. Haider Rafique, the global chief marketing officer at crypto exchange OKX, expressed disappointment in the lack of immediate buying pressure from the formalization of a Bitcoin reserve. “While establishing a Bitcoin reserve is a significant milestone, it does not create immediate buying pressure, disappointing those expecting aggressive accumulation,” Rafique stated.

Since the Federal Reserve announced in December that it would not implement as many interest rate cuts in 2025 as previously anticipated, the crypto market has lost approximately 25% of its total market cap. The optimistic outlook that many had following Trump’s election in November has quickly turned sour, as macroeconomic factors weigh heavily on the market.

Unfortunately, the current market sentiment for these cryptos supports a bearish trend, especially after the recent Solana news. The possibility of a market crash after this downward spiral isn’t far-fetched, and it has prompted investors to start moving their funds elsewhere. Panshibi , a viral meme coin, is discussed among market participants as a must-have in this market turbulence. This text has everything we know about this new crypto and why crypto observers will watch it for 100x in 2025. Panshibi: Panda-Themed Meme Coin Set To Lead The Market in 2025 Panshibi is the new viral memecoin that draws inspiration from the Pandas in Asian culture. Panshibi’s Panda mascot brings together a diverse community of folks into the Bamboo Valley. These include the Asian market participants, Panda enthusiasts, meme coin enthusiasts, etc. With such a large following, it is no wonder that Panshibi’s presale inflows have surged within a fortnight. Thousands of investors have contributed over $1.23 million to its ecosystem, and more are gearing up to join the trend. In return for such active participation, early buyers have seen an increase of over 150% and anticipate a 400% surge once the presale ends. Interestingly, Panshibi has implemented strict security measures to ensure that early buyers reap their harvests. For instance, the project locks liquidity for ten years and team tokens for two years. In the long run, this ensures that early investors are protected from insider selloffs or scams. It is also worth mentioning that Panshibi provides a bountiful income opportunity for its investors through its high-end reward programs. With staking rewards reaching up to 1,200% APY, early presale buyers generate passive income while contributing to the ecosystem. The Panshibi project team commits 15% of the total supply to staking rewards, ensuring this incentive can be sustained regularly. XRP Price Prediction: $1 In Sight Amid SEC Tussel And Massive Whale Selloff XRP, the fourth largest token by market cap, is experiencing a significant price drop, trading at approximately $2.03. The Coinmarketcap data shows that XRP has had a 4.7% decline in the last 24 hours and a whopping 15.77% drop over the past month. This adverse price action is the backdrop of the shaking market sentiment for XRP. Notably, the regulatory cloud over XRP is weighing on its investors’ confidence. While Ripple scored a partial legal victory in mid-2024, the judge’s ruling that XRP is not a security for retail sales has damaged the asset’s reputation. Ripple’s technical analysis echoes this point, and several chart experts have suggested a bleak XRP price prediction. In a recent tweet, a top analyst named Ali Martinez noted that the XRP price risks correcting to $1 in the coming weeks. The analyst argued that a head-and-shoulder pattern on the XRP price chart started forming in December 2024. Solana News Today: Sol Plunges 40% Despite Us Stockpile Inclusion Even though Solana is one of three altcoins to be included in President Trump’s Digital Asset Stockpile, its price continues to decline abruptly. Interestingly, the bullish Solana news reports that Solana has slumped 40% despite the injection of $10 billion in new liquidity. Part of Solana’s downtrend may be attributed to investors seeking safer assets following the network’s recent wave of memecoin scams. Onchain data from Defilama shows that Solana was hit by over $485 million outflows in February, with investor capital mainly flowing to Ethereum, Arbitrum, and the BNB Chain. Conclusion As the Solana and Cardano prices face terrible market volatility, Panshibi quickly becomes investors’ safe bet to ride this turbulent period. Panshibi’s future is not only bright but also hugely profitable. The opportunity is ripe for those who act now. SHIBI tokens are still available at a fair entry price of $0.005 each, but this window won’t last long.

Crypto investors and traders are panic selling again as sentiment turned sour, but this has all happened before in previous bull market cycles. Crypto analysts ‘Rekt Capital’ looked at previous cycles, noting that the average BTC correction in 2017 was 35%, and in the 2021 cycle, it was 37%. If it is to fall between these during this market cycle, prices could drop as low as $70,000. Patience is Key In late February, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes predicted a fall to $70,000 as large hedge funds unwound their ETF positions to seek better yield opportunities. “Be f***ing patient,” he said on March 10, reiterating that prediction that BTC would likely bottom around $70,000. A 36% correction from an all-time high is “very normal for a bull market,” he added. He said that central banks would start adjusting their monetary policies, which is when markets will bounce back. Capriole Fund founder Charles Edwards agreed with the notion saying , “As things get bearish, they also get more bullish,” before adding: “The worse the economic data becomes, the more relatively discounted Bitcoin tends to get and the more likely we are to see Fed easing.” “It can be wise to await a good technical recovery bounce or a key policy change instead of trying to catch falling knives,” he advised. Recession Fears Loom Recession fears have rattled investors who heavily sold off tech stocks and crypto assets on Monday. The S&P 500, tech-heavy Nasdaq, and Dow Jones Industrial Average all fell heavily as the American “magnificent 7” shed more than $750 billion in market capitalization in one day amid the US stock rout. Leading Wall Street banks such as JPMorgan have increased their odds of a recession in 2025 and decreased their predictions for GDP growth. Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood said the “market is discounting the last leg of a rolling recession,” which will give the Trump administration and central bank “many more degrees of freedom than investors expect,” leading to a recovery in the second half of this year.

US President Donald Trump’s digital asset stockpile letdown. A textbook bearish technical setup. XRP/USD four-hour price chart. Source: TradingView US recession fears hurt XRP price Escalating concerns over a potential US economic slowdown have dampened investor sentiment across financial markets, hurting XRP and the broader cryptocurrency sector. Key points: Crypto and tech stocks saw a large sell-off on March 10 due to rising US recession fears. JPMorgan raised the US recession risk to 40%, up from 30% at the start of 2025, citing extreme US policies as a key risk. The Trump administration’s recent imposition of tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada, and China has heightened fears of a global trade war. President Trump’s acknowledgment of a potential recession during a ""period of transition"" has further unsettled investors. Goldman Sachs has also increased its 12-month recession probability to 20%, up from 15%, warning that the forecast could rise if Trump maintains current policies.

White House Crypto Summit fails to impress XRP bulls XRP's price took a sharp hit following the White House’s inaugural Crypto Summit on March 7, as hopes for its inclusion in a US strategic crypto reserve were swiftly dashed . Key takeaways: Initial excitement faded after President Donald Trump’s team clarified that Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and XRP were used as illustrative examples, not official selections for the US reserve.

XRP risks 45% crash ahead XRP’s price decline today is furthermore a part of its prevailing head-and-shoulders pattern. Key points: An H&S pattern forms when the price forms three consecutive highs, with the middle peak (head) higher than the other two (shoulders). As a technical rule, the pattern resolves when the price breaks below its common support (neckline) and falls by as much as the pattern’s maximum height. XRP/USD three-day price chart. Source: TradingView As of March 10, XRP had formed what appears to be the H&S pattern’s right shoulder and was heading toward the neckline support at around $2. A decisive breakdown below the support level could send the XRP price toward $1.11 by April, down by over 45% from the current prices. Can XRP resume its bull run? A rebound from $2 neckline support could delay or invalidate the H&S pattern. Interestingly, the level aligns with two other support levels: the lower trendline of XRP’s prevailing symmetrical triangle pattern and the 50-3D EMA. XRP/USD three-day price chart. Source: TradingView A bounce, followed by a decisive close above the triangle’s upper trendline, could trigger a breakout scenario toward $3.44.

On March 10, a wallet address deposited 30,098 Ether ( ETH ), worth about $56 million, into Sky. Crypto intelligence platform Arkham labeled the address “Ethereum Foundation?,” raising speculation that the EF may have moved funds into the lending protocol — a strategy recommended by the community — instead of directly selling ETH to fund its operations. However, community members quickly dismissed the claims, clarifying that the wallet in question does not belong to the Ethereum Foundation. Eric Conner, the co-author of Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP-1559), called a Wu Blockchain report “completely fake,” implying that the address doesn’t belong to the EF. Anthony Sassano, host of The Daily Gwei , also cited the report, saying that the wallet does not belong to the EF. Source: Anthony Sassano Ethereum wallet likely from an early investor Wu Blockchain later clarified that while the account was suspected of belonging to the Ethereum Foundation, transaction history suggested it was more likely associated with an early Ethereum investor. The address received a 4 million Dai ( DAI ) transfer from the EF ETH Sale in May 2022, and initial ETH funding was traced back to a wallet called jonny.eth. The address deposited the $56 million into the Sky vault to avoid liquidation as ETH prices tumbled. On March 10, ETH dropped from a high of $2,138 to $1,813, a 15% decline. The move allowed the wallet to avoid liquidation, lowering its liquidation price to $1,127.14, 40.19% below ETH’s price of $1,896 at the time of writing. Related: Ethereum Foundation forms external council to uphold core blockchain values Ethereum Foundation deployed $120 million into DeFi protocols While the recent deposit into Sky was not linked to the Ethereum Foundation, the EF has faced criticism in the past for selling ETH for stablecoins to fund team salaries and operations. In January, community members suggested that the foundation could instead borrow stablecoins against its ETH holdings rather than sell the assets. At the time, Sassano said that instead of swapping ETH for stablecoins, the foundation should consider using Aave to borrow stablecoins against ETH. Sky allows users to do something similar. By depositing ETH, users can borrow DAI. On Feb. 13, the EF listened to the community and deployed 45,000 ETH , about $120 million at the time, to DeFi protocols Aave, Spark and Compound. Community members celebrated the move, with Aave founder and CEO Stani Kulechov saying, “DeFi will win.” The EF also said there’s “more to come,” suggesting this is not their last foray into DeFi.
