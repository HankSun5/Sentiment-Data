41448978,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=138856,1741644726,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Whale’s Strategic Rescue: Crypto Giant Averts Massive MakerDAO Liquidation with 2K ETH Deposit,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/whale-makerdao-liquidation-eth/,"In the fast-paced world of decentralized finance (DeFi), where fortunes can swing wildly in the blink of an eye, a recent on-chain event has captured the attention of crypto enthusiasts and market analysts alike. An anonymous crypto whale, facing a looming liquidation of a substantial 65,675 ETH on MakerDAO, executed a strategic rescue maneuver by depositing 2,000 ETH. This decisive action, worth millions, successfully restored the health ratio of their position and averted a potential market cascade. Let’s dive into the details of this fascinating event and understand its implications for the broader DeFi ecosystem. What Exactly Happened with the Crypto Whale and MakerDAO? Imagine navigating the turbulent waters of the crypto market, and suddenly, you find your vessel – in this case, a significant DeFi position – on the brink of capsizing. This was the situation faced by a crypto whale on MakerDAO , a leading decentralized lending platform. According to on-chain data, this particular whale was staring down the barrel of a potential liquidation of 65,675 ETH. To put that into perspective, at the time of the event, this amount was valued at a staggering $135.8 million. A liquidation of this magnitude could have sent ripples across the market, potentially triggering further liquidations and price volatility. Here’s a breakdown of the critical moments: The Threat: The whale’s position on MakerDAO was nearing the critical liquidation threshold. This meant that if the price of ETH, their collateral, were to fall further, MakerDAO’s smart contracts would automatically sell off their collateral to cover their debt. The Alert: On-chain monitoring tools, like those used by blockchain analytics firms, likely flagged this position as high-risk, triggering alerts within the crypto community. The Response: In a swift and calculated move, the whale withdrew 2,000 ETH from the Bitfinex exchange. The Rescue: Within just 20 minutes of the withdrawal, this 2,000 ETH was deposited directly into their MakerDAO vault. The Outcome: This injection of additional collateral successfully boosted the health ratio of their position to 1.07, effectively pulling it back from the brink of liquidation. [img src=”image-of-whale-depositing-eth-makerdao.jpg” alt=”Whale Deposits ETH to MakerDAO”] Why is Avoiding Liquidation So Crucial in DeFi? Liquidation events are an inherent mechanism in DeFi lending platforms like MakerDAO, designed to ensure the solvency of the system. However, they can also be incredibly painful for individual users and have broader market implications. Let’s understand why avoiding liquidation is paramount: For the Individual User: Liquidation means losing a significant portion of your collateral. When a position is liquidated, it’s not sold off at the optimal market price but rather at a discount to ensure a quick sale and cover the debt. This can result in substantial financial losses for the position holder. Systemic Risk: Large liquidations, especially of the magnitude faced by this whale, can introduce systemic risk into the DeFi ecosystem. A cascade of liquidations can lead to a rapid downward spiral in asset prices, impacting the entire market and potentially causing instability. Market Sentiment: Significant liquidation events can negatively impact market sentiment. They can create fear and uncertainty, leading to further sell-offs and hindering the overall growth and adoption of DeFi. MakerDAO and the Mechanics of Liquidation To fully appreciate the whale’s strategic rescue , it’s essential to understand how MakerDAO and its liquidation mechanism work. MakerDAO is a decentralized autonomous organization that issues DAI, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. Users can lock up collateral, such as ETH, in MakerDAO vaults to borrow DAI. The amount of DAI they can borrow is determined by the collateralization ratio, which is the value of the collateral relative to the borrowed DAI. This ratio is crucial for maintaining the health of the position. Here’s a simplified breakdown: Term Description Vault A smart contract where users deposit collateral and borrow DAI. Collateral Assets like ETH locked in the vault to secure the borrowed DAI. DAI The stablecoin borrowed against the collateral. Collateralization Ratio The ratio of collateral value to borrowed DAI value. A higher ratio indicates a healthier position. Liquidation Threshold A minimum collateralization ratio. If the ratio falls below this threshold, the vault is at risk of liquidation. Health Ratio A measure of the safety of a vault. A health ratio above 1 indicates the position is safe from immediate liquidation. When the value of the collateral (ETH in this case) decreases, or the value of DAI increases, the collateralization ratio falls. If it drops below the liquidation threshold, the MakerDAO protocol initiates liquidation. This is where the whale found themselves, and their prompt 2,000 ETH deposit was the antidote. The Significance of Whale Activity in the Crypto Market The actions of crypto whales, individuals or entities holding substantial amounts of cryptocurrency, often have a significant impact on the market. Their trades can trigger price movements, influence market sentiment, and sometimes even cause mini-crashes or rallies. This particular whale’s near-liquidation and subsequent rescue highlights several key aspects: Market Volatility: It underscores the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market, especially for assets like ETH. Even large holders are not immune to market fluctuations and the risks of liquidation. Importance of Risk Management: This event serves as a stark reminder of the critical importance of risk management in DeFi. Even sophisticated participants like whales need to actively monitor their positions and have strategies in place to mitigate risks. DeFi Infrastructure Resilience: The fact that the whale could successfully avert liquidation by depositing more collateral demonstrates the robustness of DeFi infrastructure. The transparent and permissionless nature of DeFi allows for quick and effective responses to market challenges. On-chain Transparency: The entire event, from the initial risk to the final rescue, was visible on the blockchain. This transparency is a hallmark of DeFi and allows for greater accountability and market understanding. Actionable Insights: Lessons from the Whale’s DeFi Maneuver What can we, as participants in the crypto space, learn from this whale’s experience? Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Your DeFi Positions Diligently: Whether you’re a whale or a smaller participant, regularly monitor the health ratios of your DeFi positions. Set up alerts for critical thresholds to avoid surprise liquidations. Understand Liquidation Risks: Before engaging in DeFi lending or borrowing, thoroughly understand the liquidation mechanisms of the platforms you use. Know the liquidation thresholds and how they are calculated. Diversify Your Collateral: Consider diversifying your collateral across different assets to reduce the risk associated with the price volatility of a single asset. Keep Dry Powder Ready: Maintain readily available funds (like stablecoins or easily accessible ETH) to quickly add collateral to your positions when needed, just as this whale did. Utilize Risk Management Tools: Explore and utilize DeFi risk management tools and dashboards that provide real-time monitoring and alerts for your positions across various platforms. The Future of DeFi and Risk Mitigation The DeFi space is constantly evolving, with new protocols, risk management tools, and strategies emerging regularly. Events like this whale’s near-liquidation experience contribute to the collective learning and refinement of the DeFi ecosystem. As DeFi matures, we can expect to see: More Sophisticated Risk Management Tools: Development of more advanced and user-friendly risk management tools will become crucial for wider DeFi adoption. Improved Liquidation Mechanisms: Protocols may explore more nuanced and less disruptive liquidation mechanisms to minimize market shocks. Increased User Education: Greater emphasis on user education about DeFi risks and best practices will empower participants to navigate the space more safely and effectively. Institutional Adoption: As institutions increasingly enter the DeFi space, their sophisticated risk management frameworks and resources could contribute to greater market stability. Conclusion: A Whale’s Wisdom in DeFi Waters The story of the crypto whale who averted a massive liquidation on MakerDAO is more than just a tale of high-stakes finance. It’s a compelling illustration of the risks and opportunities inherent in DeFi, the importance of strategic decision-making, and the ever-present need for vigilance in the volatile crypto market. This event serves as a valuable lesson for everyone involved in cryptocurrencies, from seasoned whales to newcomers dipping their toes into DeFi. By understanding the mechanics of platforms like MakerDAO, recognizing the signs of potential risk, and acting decisively, participants can navigate the DeFi waters more skillfully and safeguard their digital assets.

This will make the token available for trading on regulated exchanges. A Major Step for Thailand’s Crypto Framework It is worth noting that the security agency’s decision is part of updated digital asset regulations that will become operational by March 16, 2025. Reports say that these updated regulations intend to create a more flexible and structured environment for crypto businesses in Thailand. This will ensure a balance between innovation and investor protection. In February, it was reported that the agency requested the positions of industry leaders and experts on digital assets before finalizing the new framework. By approving USD₮, Thailand is taking a significant step toward integrating stablecoins into its financial system. The crypto adoption index shows that the nation is one of the most crypto-friendly jurisdictions. In fact, it is among the top 20 globally for adoption. Notably, USD₮ already accounts for around 40% of trading volumes in Thailand, with Tether’s stablecoin having a market cap of $142 billion. This new approval by the government further strengthens its role in bridging traditional finance and digital assets. Tether’s Commitment to Thailand While speaking on this development, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino, reaffirmed the company’s commitment to the Thai market. He stressed that Tether purpose is clear, to provide users with a secure, transparent, and reliable stablecoin experience. The company also intends to contribute to Thailand’s growing digital asset ecosystem by building a strong and sustainable infrastructure for stablecoins. Thailand’s forward-thinking stance on digital assets makes it a global model for crypto regulation. Unlike regions with uncertain policies, Thailand has taken proactive steps to create a structured and supportive environment for digital finance. Meanwhile, Thailand’s security agency announced plans to launch a trading system for digital tokens last month. Market Trends and Investor Confidence Despite this regulatory breakthrough, market dynamics will be crucial in adopting USD₮. As of this publication, Tether is trading at $1.00, and the trading volume is 113.46% active. In addition, this latest recognition of Tether (USDT), coincides with the firm hiring Simon McWilliams as the new Chief Financial Officer (CFO). The CEO disclosed that McWilliams’ strong background in financial audits was a key reason for his appointment. His appointment will help strengthen investor confidence in Tether’s stability and reliability.

However, ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood remains optimistic despite the price correction. Cathie Wood Shares Insight on Market Outlook According to her recent X post , Cathie Wood strongly believes that the market is seeing economic trends that could bring about a deflationary boom. The Ark Invest CEO has consistently championed a long-term, innovation-driven investment strategy in the past. This recent social media post further stresses her position. She postulated that the U.S. economy is nearing the end of a rolling recession, and Wood believes this process will trigger a major expansion. She also previously mentioned that innovation, particularly in sectors like AI, blockchain, and biotech, will significantly reshape global markets’ approach to digital assets and traditional investments. If her speculation clicks, she noted that the second half of this year could witness a rebound. This projection will be activated by more friendly monetary policies and rising institutional investment in cryptocurrency. Last month, Cathie Wood predicted that the BTC price will hit $1.5 million by 2030. However, the present market volatility suggests otherwise. Bitcoin and Altcoin Outlook Since the start of this year, the crypto market has experienced many intense crypto liquidations amid negative market sentiments. Bitcoin, for instance, is struggling to maintain key support levels. Market data shows that the coin has dropped below the $80,000 mark, down 3.18% in 24 hours. The second leading cryptocurrency, Ethereum, has also seen price fluctuations. The coin is currently trading at $1,852.09, having declined over 10% in the last 24 hours. Other altcoins, including Solana and XRP, have followed similar price declines. This has led to investor sell-offs and holding on to investments. Meanwhile, some analysts, like Cathie Wood, believe this pullback could be part of a healthy correction rather than a prolonged decline. Prospect for Market Rebound Several factors point to a potential market rebound, as experts see the market as oversold. The sustained inflow into spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs might be a catalyst to drive the market rebound. Meanwhile, the Trump administration’s latest introduction of a strategic Bitcoin reserve could lead to a major long-term market rebound. Similarly, institutional interest remains a key factor, with companies like Strategy doubling down on its Bitcoin agenda. Earlier today, CoinGape reported that MicroStrategy wants to raise $21 billion to expand its total Bitcoin holdings.

According to sources familiar with the matter, the order could include directives allowing crypto banks access to the Fed’s payment system and clarifying that stablecoins should not be classified as securities. The executive order is expected to explicitly roll back regulatory measures related to “Operation Chokepoint 2.0,” an alleged initiative under President Joe Biden that restricts banking services for cryptocurrency companies. The Trump administration views these restrictions as detrimental to the growth of the digital asset industry, sources familiar with the matter said. Bo Hines, executive director of the White House Presidential Task Force on Digital Assets, confirmed that an order was in development but declined to provide details. “I think the industry can expect something very soon,” Hines said. Related News: Bitwise Official Says “The Market Is Absolutely Wrong” About The Decline, Shares His Bullish Scenario One of the most significant impacts of Trump’s upcoming executive order could be a shift in the Fed’s stance on granting master accounts to crypto-focused banks. Master accounts provide direct access to the Fed’s payment system, a requirement for banks that serve customers nationwide. Under the Biden administration, the Fed has consistently denied master accounts to crypto-friendly banks like Custodia Bank, effectively preventing them from operating. If implemented, a policy change from the Fed that would grant access to the payment system could represent a major breakthrough for the digital asset industry. However, the Fed is an independent institution and its policies are not determined by the executive branch. According to the Fed’s official policy, its decisions “do not require the approval of the president or anyone in the executive or legislative branches of government.” This could present a legal challenge to any directive that attempts to force the central bank to take action. Senior White House officials are set to meet on Thursday to discuss potential legal challenges before finalizing the executive order, the sources said. The administration aims to ensure the directive withstands legal scrutiny before it reaches President Trump’s desk for his signature. The guidance is also expected to address stablecoins and reaffirm that they should not be classified as securities. If signed, this would be the third cryptocurrency-focused executive order President Trump has issued since taking office. *This is not investment advice.

This requires strong political will, resources, and ongoing commitment from both sides. Harmonizing Regulations: While collaboration is key, fully harmonizing regulations between two sovereign nations can be complex. Differences in legal systems and national priorities may present hurdles. Industry Adaptation: Cryptocurrency businesses operating in these regions will need to adapt to the evolving regulatory landscape. Clear communication and guidance from regulatory bodies will be crucial to ensure smooth transitions and compliance. Global Regulatory Landscape: The global AML and crypto regulation landscape is constantly evolving. El Salvador and Paraguay will need to stay agile and adapt their strategies to remain aligned with international best practices and standards. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? For individuals and businesses involved in cryptocurrency, here are some key takeaways and actionable insights: Increased Regulatory Scrutiny: Expect heightened scrutiny on cryptocurrency service providers operating in El Salvador and Paraguay. Unlicensed operations will likely face increased pressure. Emphasis on Compliance: Businesses should prioritize compliance with AML regulations and licensing requirements in both countries. This proactive approach will be essential for long-term sustainability. Opportunities for Legitimate Businesses: The push for clearer regulation and AML compliance can create a more level playing field, potentially benefiting legitimate and compliant cryptocurrency businesses.

In this category, Bybit was second only to Binance in trading volume before the February 21 hack, with an average of over 25% of the trading volume leading up to the incident. That has now dropped to 10.57% by March 9. Exchanges Market Share (Source: Kaiko) Interstingly, Bybit’s loss was Binance’s gain. The world’s largest exchange was the biggest beneficiary of the user exodus, as trading activity increased significantly after the Bybit hack. It was clear how Binance’s market share increased significantly. Before the hack, Binance was responsible for around 50% of the daily trading volume for centralized offshore exchanges. However, that changed significantly after the hack, with its market share average rising above 60%. Binance. The exchange accounted for 70.5% of the trading volume on February 23, 48 hours after the Bybit hack. Still, other exchanges also saw their market share increase after the incident, even if not at a similar rate to Binance’s. OKX and Coinbase’s share of the trading volume has been relatively higher since the incident. Bybit showing signs of recovery Meanwhile, Bybit’s current market share is a sign of a resurgence in trading activity, showing that some of its users are returning. In the days following the hack, the market share was in a free fall, leading to Bybit’s overall share hitting as low as 5.44% on March 2, just as its share of offshore exchange volume also reached its bottom at 6.42%. This highlights how the exchange’s crisis management enabled it to survive the biggest heist against a financial institution. By choosing not to pause withdrawals during the worst hours of the crisis and keeping users updated, the exchange was able to retain the trust of most in the crypto community. However, efforts to recover the funds have been quite slow. Despite multi-party efforts involving several security experts, only around 3% of the funds have been frozen so far. According to data from Bybit LazarusBounty page, only $43.71 million has been recovered so far. The exchange has also kept its word of giving out 10% of every recovered fund as a bounty. So far, it has paid out $4.32 million to several individuals and organizations that have helped freeze funds or provided information that led to the freezing. Despite this effort, the hackers have been able to convert at least $300 million of the stolen funds, according to data from Elliptic. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The winds of change might be blowing in Washington, D.C., and they could carry a seismic shift for the cryptocurrency industry. Whispers from industry insiders suggest that former President Donald Trump is poised to potentially sign an executive order this week that could dramatically alter the landscape of crypto banking rules in the United States. Could this be the game-changer the crypto world has been waiting for? Let’s dive deep into what this could mean for you, for crypto businesses, and for the future of digital finance. Will Trump’s Executive Order Really Overturn Anti-Crypto Banking Rules? According to a report by Decrypt, citing credible industry sources, the upcoming Trump executive order is expected to directly address and potentially dismantle the current administration’s perceived restrictive stance on crypto banking. The core aim? To pave the way for easier access to traditional banking services for cryptocurrency companies . This move could be a monumental leap forward for the industry, which has long grappled with regulatory hurdles and limited access to the conventional financial system. But what exactly are these ‘anti-crypto banking rules’ that are causing such a stir? Let’s break it down: Perceived Hostility: Many in the crypto industry feel that current regulations and interpretations have created an environment of uncertainty and even hostility towards digital asset businesses. This includes stricter compliance requirements and increased scrutiny from regulatory bodies. Banking Access Challenges: One of the most significant pain points for crypto companies is securing and maintaining relationships with banks. Many traditional financial institutions are hesitant to work with crypto businesses due to regulatory ambiguity, compliance costs, and perceived risks. Master Account Access: Access to master accounts at the Federal Reserve is crucial for payment system efficiency. Currently, very few crypto-focused institutions have been granted these accounts, hindering their ability to operate smoothly within the traditional financial system. If the reports are accurate, Trump’s executive order aims to directly address these challenges. The promise of overturning these perceived ‘anti-crypto’ policies has sent ripples of excitement throughout the crypto community, fueling speculation and hope for a more welcoming regulatory environment. Unpacking the Potential Impact: Access to Banks and the Federal Reserve The most tantalizing aspect of this potential executive order is the promise of facilitating banking access for cryptocurrency companies , specifically mentioning access to master accounts within the Federal Reserve ’s payment system. This is not just about opening checking accounts; it’s about integrating crypto businesses more deeply into the core financial infrastructure of the United States. Imagine a scenario where crypto exchanges, custodians, and payment processors can seamlessly access the same payment rails as traditional financial institutions. The benefits could be transformative: Reduced Operational Friction: Master accounts would streamline payment processing, reduce transaction costs, and enhance operational efficiency for crypto businesses. Increased Trust and Legitimacy: Access to the Fed’s payment system could lend greater legitimacy and trust to the crypto industry in the eyes of both consumers and traditional financial players. Level Playing Field: It could create a more level playing field between traditional financial institutions and emerging crypto companies, fostering innovation and competition. Boost for Innovation: With easier banking access, crypto companies can focus more on innovation and less on navigating complex regulatory hurdles and banking limitations.However, it’s crucial to temper expectations. While a presidential executive order carries significant weight, its practical implementation and long-term impact are not guaranteed. Several factors could influence the actual outcome. The Federal Reserve’s Independence: A Potential Hurdle? The report itself acknowledges a critical point: the Federal Reserve may not be directly influenced by the White House in terms of policy. The Fed is designed to be an independent central bank, insulated from direct political interference. This raises a key question: To what extent can a presidential executive order truly mandate the Fed to grant master accounts or alter its supervisory approach to cryptocurrency companies ? Here’s a balanced perspective: Potential Influence of the Executive Order Limitations Due to Fed Independence Setting Policy Direction: The EO can set a clear policy direction from the executive branch, signaling a desire for a more crypto-friendly banking environment. Directing Regulatory Agencies: The EO could direct other regulatory agencies, such as the Treasury Department or OCC, to take actions that indirectly influence the Fed. Public Pressure: A strong executive order can create public and political pressure on the Fed to reconsider its stance and approach. Operational Independence: The Fed retains operational independence in its decisions regarding master accounts and supervisory policies. Statutory Mandate: The Fed operates under a statutory mandate from Congress, and its actions are guided by its interpretation of those laws. Risk Management: The Fed’s primary concern is the safety and soundness of the financial system. It will likely prioritize risk management considerations when evaluating applications for master accounts, regardless of political pressure. Therefore, while a Trump executive order could be a significant catalyst for change, it’s unlikely to be a magic wand that instantly transforms the Fed’s approach. The Fed will likely continue to apply its rigorous due diligence and risk assessment processes when considering applications from cryptocurrency companies . Navigating the Path Forward: Actionable Insights for Crypto Businesses Regardless of the immediate outcome of this potential executive order, the very prospect of it signals a potential shift in the political winds. For cryptocurrency companies , this is a moment to be proactive and strategic. Here are some actionable insights: Prepare for Increased Scrutiny: Even with a more favorable policy environment, regulatory scrutiny is unlikely to disappear. Crypto businesses should continue to prioritize robust compliance programs and risk management frameworks. Engage with Policymakers: Actively engage with policymakers and regulators to educate them about the crypto industry and advocate for sensible regulations. Industry associations and lobbying efforts can play a crucial role. Strengthen Banking Relationships: Proactively build relationships with banks, even if access is currently limited. Demonstrate a commitment to compliance, transparency, and sound business practices to increase attractiveness as a banking client. Explore Alternative Banking Solutions: While pursuing traditional banking access, explore alternative banking solutions that cater to the crypto industry, such as specialized crypto-friendly banks or fintech platforms. Stay Informed and Adaptable: The regulatory landscape for crypto is constantly evolving. Stay informed about policy developments and be prepared to adapt your business strategies accordingly. Conclusion: A Hopeful Glimmer or a Transformative Dawn for Crypto Banking? The potential Trump executive order to overturn perceived anti- crypto banking rules represents a potentially monumental moment for the cryptocurrency industry. While the extent of its impact, particularly on the independent Federal Reserve , remains to be seen, the symbolic and directional shift could be significant. For cryptocurrency companies , this news offers a powerful glimmer of hope – a potential pathway towards greater integration with the traditional financial system, reduced operational friction, and a more level playing field for innovation. Whether this glimmer evolves into a transformative dawn for crypto banking depends on the specifics of the executive order, the Fed’s response, and the continued advocacy and resilience of the crypto industry itself. One thing is clear: the conversation around crypto and banking is far from over, and the next chapter promises to be intensely interesting.

The second stage of the presale has to raise only $2M to close, opening up the next stage of the project. World Liberty Financial has almost finalized the last stage of its WLFI token presale. A little over 40M tokens remain, with a price tag of $0.05, awaiting inflows of just $2M. The fundraising remained relatively slow, as most of the buying was for retail amounts. The fund is closing its second presale, after previously placing another 25B tokens at $0.015. For now, WLFI has not attracted other large-scale buyers, and most of the purchases are similar to small donations. WLFI continues to be sold most often for Ethereum (ETH) or USDC. WLFI purchases range from as low as $10 in USDC to 3.1ETH for one of the recent additions. The latest stage increased WLFI holders to 85,569 wallets. The fund’s next stage is to run its own version of an Aave vault, providing passive income based on crypto lending. The exact use case of the WLFI token will become clearer in the future, though the asset will remain locked and non-transferable for at least a year after the presale ends. World Liberty Fi portfolio loses $3M in a day World Liberty Fi is more than a fund and was used as an indicator for reliable token selection. Despite this, estimated losses from peak value may be up to $110M . It is hard to estimate the exact losses, since the fund has traded and reorganized its portfolio to retain value. The portfolio’s goal would be to ensure collaterals for an Aave vault, which would produce passive income. For that reason, World Liberty Fi has converted some of its assets into the most widely used collaterals on Aave. As of March 10, the fund’s portfolio based on the main public wallet fell to $75M in value, down $3M in a few hours. A rough estimate shows Ethereum (ETH) is the biggest source of losses, contributing up to 65% for the loss on paper. The fund bets on the Ethereum ecosystem, with ETH and its wrapped versions as the biggest holding. World Liberty Fi consolidated its holdings, with ETH still holding a prominent position. | Source: Arkham Intelligence Currently, the fund retains 7.53K ETH, valued at over $14M. This is the fund’s biggest holding, accrued in the past weeks from WLFI purchases and trading. The fund has been known to trade actively and buy the dip on ETH. Despite this, World Liberty Fi lost 9% of the ETH value in the past day, as the asset sank under $2,000. ETH makes up over 65% of the fund’s holdings, practically making the Trump family Ethereum maximalists. Even Eric Trump, one of the persons closest to the fund, has been taken to task for his recommendation to buy ETH, just before another significant price drawdown. Some of the assets of World Liberty Fi have been moved to other wallets, though one of the public addresses remains the most active, receiving inflows from buyers. World Liberty Fi retains its TRON (TRX) holdings, which have also posted the smallest losses. The fund also expanded its Movement (MOVE) holdings. Overall, World Liberty Fi decreased its token selection, removing some of its tokens from the main wallet. After recent token movements and shifts, the fund’s portfolio is more limited. World Liberty Fi has moved its Ondo (ONDO) and Chainlink (LINK) holdings while onboarding Whitebit (WHITE). Some of the funds were shifted to WBTC, serving both as a DeFi-compatible asset and a tracker of the BTC market price.

The company looks to address inefficiencies in the U.S. derivatives market, where trading has traditionally been limited to fixed hours and contracts with set expirations. Coinbase’s Futures Expansion Targets Institutional and Retail U.S. Traders According to Coinbase , crypto derivatives trading accounts for roughly 75% of global crypto volumes, yet a significant portion of these transactions have occurred outside the U.S. By launching perpetual-style futures contracts, Coinbase seeks to provide American traders access to the same international instruments while ensuring compliance with U.S. regulatory standards.

Coinbase has partnered with Nodal Clear to facilitate clearing services and ensure compliance with CFTC regulations. The exchange stated that introducing 24/7 futures trading is a step toward a more competitive U.S. derivatives market. The company also revealed plans to develop a new type of perpetual-style futures contract modeled after long-dated international offerings, designed to adhere to U.S. regulations. U.S. traders have historically been constrained by fixed trading hours, causing them to miss market movements occurring outside of regular sessions. With these changes, traders can manage risk and execute strategies in real time, eliminating a key limitation in the domestic market. Coinbase has been working with the CFTC and market participants to finalize the design of the new products. The company’s plans signal an effort to expand regulated crypto derivatives offerings in the U.S., where offshore platforms have traditionally held an advantage. Coinbase Expands U.S. Presence Amid CFTC’s Push for Digital Asset Innovation In February, Coinbase took a major step in the U.S. crypto derivatives market, introducing CFTC-approved futures contracts for Solana (SOL) and Hedera (HBAR). These contracts, structured for diverse trading strategies, add to Coinbase Derivatives’ growing portfolio, which now includes 19 futures contracts, such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and Dogecoin (DOGE).

Following the White House Crypto Summit, Armstrong expressed optimism about the industry’s growth potential under the current administration. While policy changes have sparked optimism, the ultimate direction of crypto regulation in the U.S. remains uncertain. How Coinbase’s move into perpetual futures influences the broader U.S. market—and whether regulatory clarity materializes—will be pivotal in shaping crypto’s domestic future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How might continuous futures trading reshape market dynamics? By enabling constant trading, nonstop futures boost liquidity and refine price discovery, yet may trigger swift price shifts if risk management systems fail to adapt to the faster pace. What regulatory hurdles could emerge from round-the-clock trading? Expanding trading hours require regulators to heighten oversight and adapt rules. Balancing market innovation with investor safeguards remains a challenge, as continuous trading complicates traditional risk monitoring. How could nonstop futures affect U.S. market competitiveness? Nonstop futures could strengthen the U.S. market standing by aligning domestic practices with global trends. This may foster better risk controls and encourage wider investor participation, enhancing overall market resilience.

The filing makes it the first ETF associated with the recently decentralized blockchain. Movement has announced that it is set to launch the beta version of the mainnet. In a prospectus filed on Monday, the fund will devote 80% of the net as MOVE tokens or related derivatives by channeling the fund into a REX-Osprey MOVE Subsidiary. The approval of the SEC requires an acknowledgment from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission before any action can be taken on it. Movement’s co-founder Rushi Manche highlighted that the ETF filing was an important step for the company. “Breaking the pattern of ETFs limited to long-established cryptocurrencies opens doors for institutional capital to support next-generation blockchain innovation,” Manche stated. Recent ETF applications for altcoins, including XRP, SOL, and HEDERA, reveal an increasing trend of seeking institutional investment and adopting digital assets. Rex Shares and Osprey Funds had also requested funds tracking assets, including BONK, DOGE, and TRUMP memecoin. Movement’s development and controversies Movement was built using the MoveOS programming language initially by Meta, a company that had planned to use it on Diem, its former stablecoin. Its implementation has also been criticized for not being transparent enough. The Movement Network Foundation officially released Movement Mainnet Beta on 30th November, but its deployment was delayed until 9th December. The network recently incorporated RPC service, and a core mainnet release is expected before the 10th of March. This ecosystem will launch the Cornucopia program to seed $250 million for the Movement Public Mainnet Beta. However, the team has faced much criticism over its political affiliations. Manche earlier defined politics as a major approach of crypto companies, other blockchain initiatives share the same opinion to inevitably adapt to the pro-crypto Trump administration. An unplanned Movement devnet launch in January raised some eyebrows after a DeFi startup, World Liberty Financial, connected to the Trump family, bought $2 million worth of MOVE tokens just a few minutes before reports emerged that indicated Movement was in talks with Musk about some integration to blockchain. Manche also dismissed accusations of insider trading. Under the leadership of the new commissioner, Acting Chair Mark T. Uyeda, the SEC is more friendly towards the crypto space. However, it has not authorized ETFs indexed to anything besides Bitcoin and Ethereum. The Movement ETF filing will go through the approval process before any action is made.

March Predictions Are In!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/what-will-solanas-future-be-march-forecasts-are-in/,"Solana (SOL) is facing a tough month with forecasters predicting further declines in its price throughout March. According to Polymarket data, the probability of Solana breaking above its all-time high of $300 this month has dropped to just 1% from 9% on March 2. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency has a 72% chance of falling to $110 from its current price of $118.94. Solana’s struggles come amid broader turmoil in the cryptocurrency market. SOL has lost nearly 60% of its value since President Donald Trump took office. The decline is not limited to Solana, as rival cryptocurrency XRP is also facing a similar downtrend. A number of factors contributed to this decline, including Trump’s volatile trade policies with China and allied countries, his pro-crypto stance falling short of industry expectations, and the $1.5 billion hack of the Bybit exchange. Related News: SEC Takes Action on Anti-Cryptocurrency Rule from Gary Gensler's Era, They're Changing It Solana’s reputation also took a hit in February when Argentine President Javier Milei introduced the Libra memecoin, which was launched on the Solana network. The token reached a market value of $4 billion before crashing 80% in an hour, costing investors $1.6 billion in losses. Adding to the uncertainty, Polymarket forecasters have lowered their expectations for Solana’s potential inclusion in the newly announced U.S. strategic crypto reserve. On March 2, when Trump unexpectedly announced the establishment of the reserve and suggested it could include Solana, the probability of SOL being included had reached 42%. However, those odds have since dropped to 23%. The probability of a Solana exchange-traded fund (ETF) being approved in 2025 also fell to 79% from 86% over the weekend, according to Polymarket, further dampening optimism. Several asset managers, including Franklin Templeton, have filed applications for a Solana ETF, some of which have been accepted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). *This is not investment advice.

While some of the old-school players like Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to dominate, many newer altcoins are now stepping up to the plate, offering massive opportunities for those brave enough to take the plunge. The challenge, though, is spotting the gems before they hit the mainstream. Take Cardano, for example—it’s one of those coins that people thought had all the potential in the world, yet it’s been slipping under the radar for too long. Big returns? It’s not looking likely anymore. On the flip side, Qubetics ($TICS) is a crypto that’s rising through the ranks fast, and it’s not just hype. The $TICS presale is already in its 25th stage, and experts are predicting jaw-dropping gains in the near future. For anyone looking to snag one of the top cryptos for significant returns in 2025, don’t let this one pass by. Sure, Cardano had its time in the sun, but there are new contenders offering even greater potential for those who know where to look. When thinking about top cryptos for significant returns, it’s crucial to identify projects that go beyond just being another “altcoin.” These are the projects that address real-world problems, making them the go-to solutions for industries and individuals alike. Qubetics is one such project that stands out, especially with its game-changing application, QubeQode IDE, which has real-world use cases that many existing cryptos can’t match. In short, while Cardano’s time may be behind it, Qubetics is where the future lies. Cardano Coin: A Missed Opportunity for Big Returns? If you’ve been following the crypto space for a while, you probably remember when Cardano was all the rage. It’s a coin that had its time in the spotlight and a loyal following, but today, it feels like Cardano’s ship has sailed. The hype around it was real in the early stages. The promise of scalability, a strong academic backing, and a robust development ecosystem had people believing Cardano could be the next big thing. Fast forward a few years, and things just didn’t pan out the way people hoped. One of the major reasons Cardano didn’t live up to expectations is the fact that it’s been slow to roll out key features. While other cryptos have been iterating fast, Cardano has often been criticized for taking its sweet time, which means it’s not always as competitive as it needs to be. Additionally, the market has moved on, and with so many new projects emerging, Cardano just doesn’t seem to have that same “wow” factor it once did. Cardano was supposed to be the “Ethereum killer,” but it’s been hard to find that killer instinct. Looking at Cardano’s current market position, it’s clear that significant returns aren’t going to come easy for anyone still holding the coin. Sure, there may still be some occasional spikes, but for anyone thinking about getting into Cardano now, it’s tough to imagine the kind of explosive gains that were once predicted. By the time the ship finally comes in, those hoping for top cryptos for significant returns in 2025 might have missed out. It’s a classic example of how waiting too long on a project can result in missed opportunities. Qubetics: A Real Opportunity in 2025 for Top Cryptos for Significant Returns Now, let’s talk about Qubetics. It’s not just another flashy cryptocurrency with a bold name and promises of moonshots. This is a project that actually delivers—one that is actively addressing real-world problems and has all the makings of a massive hit in 2025 and beyond. The $TICS presale is in its 25th stage right now, and it’s been selling fast. So far, over 498 million tokens have been sold to more than 22,700 holders, raising over $14.9 million. But the real story here is what Qubetics is doing with its technology—specifically the QubeQode IDE. QubeQode IDE is a game-changer. Imagine a tool that allows businesses, software developers, and individuals to build and deploy decentralized applications (dApps) with ease. For someone who’s been stuck using clunky, outdated software for years, QubeQode is a breath of fresh air. It streamlines the development process, removes unnecessary barriers, and puts power back in the hands of those who need it most. For developers, QubeQode is a platform where they can create apps without the usual bottlenecks, cutting down on time spent on coding, testing, and debugging. Let’s break this down with real-life scenarios. Think about a small business owner who’s tired of relying on centralized platforms for all their transactions. With Qubetics, they can easily build and implement blockchain-based solutions that can save time and reduce costs. Maybe you’re a developer who wants to build a decentralized social media platform. Using QubeQode, you’d be able to quickly put together a secure, scalable application without the usual headaches. The possibilities are endless. And here’s the kicker: Analysts are predicting some serious gains for $TICS once the presale ends. Right now, $TICS is priced at just $0.1074, but by the end of the crypto presale , it could be worth $0.25, representing a 132% return on investment. After the presale? Experts are talking about $TICS reaching $1, $5, and even $15—imagine an ROI of 830% or more. If $TICS hits $15, that’s an astronomical 13,859% return. Analysts believe that $TICS could hit the $10-$15 mark after the mainnet launch. If you’re still sitting on the sidelines, now is the time to get in before this ship sails too. Why Qubetics Stands Out as One of the Top Cryptos for Significant Returns The beauty of Qubetics lies in its unique approach to solving real-life problems. Unlike many cryptocurrencies that focus solely on being a store of value or currency, Qubetics is about building real-world applications with lasting impact. Whether you’re a tech professional, a business owner, or even someone just trying to make their daily life a bit easier, Qubetics offers something that actually works. It’s one of the few projects in the crypto space where the underlying technology has real utility. And as the crypto market grows, the demand for innovative solutions like Qubetics is only going to increase. With the Qubetics presale ongoing and analysts predicting significant price growth in 2025, now is the perfect time to get involved with one of the top cryptos for significant returns. The combination of strong utility, real-world applications, and high growth potential makes Qubetics a no-brainer for anyone looking to capitalize on the future of blockchain technology. Conclusion The market is full of opportunities for those who know where to look. Cardano, once touted as a leader in the space, now feels like a missed opportunity. Meanwhile, Qubetics is poised for huge success, with its unique technology and presale momentum indicating significant price growth in the near future. As more people realize the potential of $TICS, it’s only a matter of time before it breaks out in a big way. So, if you’re looking for top cryptos for significant returns in 2025, don’t sleep on Qubetics. The time to act is now.

Park had been released on bail pending allegations of orchestrating an alleged $60 million crypto scam that centers on a token named Podo Coin. Scam Coin Allegations: Fresh Arrest Warrant for Market Maker The newspaper Seoul Kyungjae reported that the newly formalized Joint Investigation Unit for Virtual Asset Crimes (JIU) , part of the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors’ Office, has now been charged with a separate offence. Cars seized from ‘scam coin’ suspect and crypto market maker Jon Bur Kim in prosecution raids. (Source: Maeil Kyungjae/Screenshot) Prosecutors think that Park helped list and issue an alleged “scam coin” named Artube (ATT). They think that Park and his associates use the token to dupe investors out of a total of 260 billion won ($179.6 million). Notable crypto exchanges , including South Korea’s Coinone, have previously listed ATT. But ATT trading volumes and coin value have plummeted in more recent times. Trading volumes on the South Korean crypto exchange Coinone over the past 12 months. (Source: CoinGecko) Following its listing, ATT prices initially surged. However, prices began to fall soon after. In early February last year, Coinone designated ATT as a coin of concern, citing the following reasons: suspension of official community activities inactivity of major businesses and services failure to inform investors about major short-term and mid- to long-term business plans failure to disclose related information in a timely manner Coinone, EconomyBloc reported last year, contacted the “project team” for answers, but was unsatisfied with the developers’ response. On February 20, Coinone wrote that it had decided to “end trading support for ATT to protect investors.” Transaction support was ended in early March, with withdrawal support following a month later.

Dogecoin Is Currently Testing The Lower Bound Of An Ascending Channel In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed about a long-term pattern forming in the weekly price of Dogecoin. The pattern in question is the “Ascending Channel” from technical analysis (TA), which is a type of Parallel Channel. A Parallel Channel is a consolidation pattern in which the price of the asset remains locked between two parallel trendlines. The upper level of the channel is likely to provide resistance, while the lower one can be a point of support. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Signal Aligns With Price Tops, CryptoQuant Analyst Reveals Breaks out of either of these lines can imply a continuation of trend in that direction. That is, an escape above the channel is bullish, while a drop under it is bearish. Parallel Channels can be categorized into three types, based on the alignment of the trendlines with respect to the coordinate axes. Channels that are slopped upwards (that is, those that have trendlines that follow higher lows and higher highs) are known as Ascending Channels. While an asset is inside this type of channel, its price witnesses consolidation to the net upside Similarly, those of the opposite orientation are called Descending Channels and represent consolidation to the net downside. The third case, where the trendlines are parallel to the time-axis, has no special name. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst, that shows an Ascending Channel that the weekly price of Dogecoin has been trading inside for the past decade: As is visible above, the 1-week Dogecoin price has witnessed a sharp decline recently and is nearing in on the lower level of the channel situated at $0.16. The last time that the memecoin retested the line was during the last few months of 2024 and it successfully found support back then. “All eyes on Dogecoin $DOGE! If it holds this level at $0.16 and bounces, a move to $2 could be next!” notes the analyst. This $2 target is roughly around where the asset would meet the middle line of the channel, a level that has also shown interactions with its price in the past. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Signal: $900 Million In BTC Leaves Exchanges It only remains to be seen, though, whether the memecoin will indeed find support and the Ascending Channel will continue to hold. There is always the chance of a breakdown with patterns like these, which, as mentioned earlier, can lead to bearish price action. DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is floating around $0.176, down more than 20% over the last seven days.

The addition is a nod to the company’s healthy fiscal outlook, giving it some leeway to outdo mining-specific challenges that may arise, especially following a halving that happened in April 2024. While most industry participants are fighting for their lives, CleanSpark has overcome those odds and become one of the most successful public Bitcoin miners of 2025. CleanSpark performance has been consistent throughout the period CleanSpark chief executive officer and president, Zack Bradford, has been enjoying the success of a stronger business model, which has led to CleanSpark’s addition to the S&P SmallCap 600 Index. The addition creates value, a cascade opportunity, and a more diversified investment, but it also creates, as he puts it, “vertical integration” in Bitcoin mining. CleanSpark’s profits surged to $241.7 million, or $0.85 per share, in the final quarter of 2024, up from just $25.9 million a year earlier. This represents an 833% rise YoY. Company-wide revenues jumped 120% on a year-over-year basis to $162.3 million. As of February 2025, CleanSpark’s BTC holdings rose 6% to 11,177 BTC, positioning it as one of the top five public BTC mining and holding companies. The Bitcoin mining business has been struggling since halving in April 2024. This placed other players in the mining industry in a weaker economic position and caused them to look for alternate sources of revenue. AI data centre build-outs are also taking a market share that rightly deserves to be taken away from the old-school Bitcoin mining business, which is far more profitable. CleanSpark has succeeded when everyone else is feeling pressed Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in the parts of the economy that are now severely bottlenecked remain one surefire way to stifle competition early. However, the biggest moves in the industry have already occurred. According to JPMorgan, Riot Platforms and CleanSpark, which have aggressively expanded their holdings, have fortified their positions competitively. As many Bitcoin miners navigate shifts within the industry, CleanSpark has a more bullish outlook. The April 2024 Bitcoin halving event that reduced block reward and miner revenues forced many companies to revise their strategies. Consequently, a few mining companies turned to AI data centers, which have been considerably more profitable. This transition remains largely under the general public’s radar, as Nvidia GPUs dedicated to AI model training operate at vastly greater scales than those used for Bitcoin mining. With this evolution comes a wave of M&A in the industry as smaller firms struggle to survive. JPMorgan also points out that CleanSpark and Riot Platforms have aggressively pursued acquisitions to increase their market share. In contrast, capital-constrained miners such as IREN and Cipher have pursued a more disciplined path, searching for alternative forms of revenue with lower capital needs.

The Meteoric Rise of Official TRUMP Coin Launched on January 17, 2025, just days before President Donald Trump’s inauguration, the Official TRUMP Coin ($TRUMP) took the crypto world by storm. Hosted on the Solana blockchain, $TRUMP debuted with an initial coin offering (ICO) of 200 million tokens, priced between $7 and $8 each. Within 24 hours, the coin’s value skyrocketed over 300%, reaching a market capitalization exceeding $14 billion. The coin’s distribution was notably centralized, with 80% of the total supply retained by Trump-affiliated entities, CIC Digital LLC and Fight Fight Fight LLC, to be released gradually over three years. This concentration raised eyebrows among investors and ethics experts, sparking debates about potential conflicts of interest and market manipulation. Despite these concerns, early investors who seized the opportunity during the ICO reaped substantial rewards. The coin peaked at $74.59 before stabilizing around $52, offering significant returns for those who entered early. However, as with many meme coins, $TRUMP’s price experienced volatility, emphasizing the importance of timing in such investments. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, Arctic Pablo Coin emerges as a compelling opportunity for those seeking exponential returns in the meme coin space. Its unique presale structure, attractive staking rewards, and deflationary mechanisms make it a standout choice among the top new meme coins for exponential returns.

Expert Weighs In,https://cryptopotato.com/is-bitcoin-immune-to-stock-market-volatility-expert-weighs-in/,"Bitcoin, the number one cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is facing market turbulence, but prominent trader CrediBULL Crypto remains unfazed. He argues that BTC’s correlation with traditional stocks is overstated, and maintains that the asset’s long-term trajectory remains intact. Bitcoin’s Correlation With Stocks: Overblown Fears? The recent dip in the price of Bitcoin, where it dropped below $80,000, has sparked debate over its ties to traditional financial markets. Some analysts fear the weaknesses witnessed in equities could spill over into crypto. However, CrediBULL Crypto is of the opinion that the S&P 500’s correction is a normal market movement rather than a sign of deeper trouble. “The correction we have seen thus far on it, for all intents and purposes, is considered healthy/normal based on my system,” the trader wrote on X. He highlighted that historically, BTC has moved independently, even during times of macroeconomic uncertainty. While mainstream finance experts see risk, CrediBULL views the current dip as an opportunity for patient investors. “Charts that look ‘cooked’ present the most lucrative opportunities,” he asserted , dismissing concerns about looming economic slowdowns. The investor, with more than 465,000 followers on X, advised traders to focus on Bitcoin’s technical levels rather than stock market trends. According to him, the original cryptocurrency is forming a base between key resistance and support zones, leading him to believe that holding current levels would be a bullish indicator. However, market analysts such as Peter Brandt and BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, have pointed to a potential drop below $80,000 for BTC. Brandt has noted a double-top pattern, warning that the cryptocurrency needs to reclaim $90,000 to reverse bearish sentiment. On his part, Hayes sees a potential retest of $78,000, with $75,000 as the next downside target if the asset’s weakness persists. Market Sentiment While the coin is still up 18.6% across 12 months, its current price is 25% lower than its all-time high level of $108,786 recorded earlier in the year. Despite the pullback, long-term sentiment has improved. Even though the Fear and Greed Index shifted from 92 a year ago, signaling “extreme greed,” to a recent low of 10 , indicating “extreme fear,” the price of Bitcoin is still nearly 20% higher than it was then. For now, investors are urged to stay patient and have a strategy for both bearish and bullish turns. “Key is to have a plan for either outcome so you literally can’t lose,” is CrediBULL’s advice.

Every time everyone shouts that this time is different.” According to Barhydt, the current pullback mirrors market movements from 2017, when increased fiat liquidity led to significant asset price gains. He suggests that underlying macroeconomic conditions remain largely the same, suggesting that Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory is still on track. Related News: SEC Takes Action on Anti-Cryptocurrency Rule from Gary Gensler's Era, They're Changing It Barhydt outlined several key economic factors that he believes will drive future liquidity in financial markets, including Bitcoin: Lower Treasury yields to refinance debt. Lower mortgage rates to unlock residential and commercial real estate markets. Lower Treasury yields to support struggling banks. He also pointed to China’s economic struggles, saying the country is in a deep recession and is likely to benefit from lower U.S. interest rates, which could allow for more monetary easing. Barhydt predicts significant job losses in the coming months in the government, technology and housing sectors. However, he expects the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) index to rise during this period, suggesting continued economic activity. “All of this tells us that liquidity will continue to flow and markets will do what they always do in these types of cycles,” he explained, adding: “That liquidity will flow into stocks, into Bitcoin, into crypto, into real estate.” While Bitcoin’s sudden drop has alarmed many, Barhydt remains optimistic, arguing that the current downturn is a temporary pullback in a larger liquidity-driven growth cycle. “One more time… fasten your seat belts,” he said. *This is not investment advice.

Crypto trader Ali Martinez tells his 131,400 followers on the social media platform X that the top five dollar-pegged crypto assets by market cap have a total valuation of $204.7 billion. The five largest stablecoins in the market include Tether’s USDT , Circle’s USDC , USDS , Ethena’s USDe and DAI , according to data from CoinGecko . Source: Ali Martinez/X A soaring stablecoin market cap suggests more buying power on the sidelines. It may also suggest that investors are unloading their crypto assets in favor of dollar-pegged coins. Looking at Ethena ( ENA ), a decentralized protocol designed to provide a crypto-based alternative to the traditional banking system, Martinez says the altcoin is flashing a bullish signal based on the Tom DeMark Sequential indicator. Traders use the TD Sequential Indicator to predict potential trend reversals for tokens based on the closing prices of their 13 previous bars or candles. “Ethena ENA is flashing bullish signals! A buy signal from the TD Sequential indicator on the weekly chart, combined with a hammer candlestick at key support, suggests a strong rebound could be ahead.” Source: Ali Martinez/X A hammer candlestick pattern is typically viewed as a bullish reversal signal with the candle wick indicating demand. At time of writing, ENA is trading for $0.44. The trader adds that the decentralized oracle network Chainlink ( LINK ) and the modular blockchain Celestia ( TIA ) are also showing signs of a potential rebound based on the TD Sequential indicator. At time of writing, LINK is worth $14.30 and TIA is trading for $3.11.

His earlier stance indicates a preference for measured, conventional monetary policies. Renewed focus on his views hints at possible shifts in Canada’s economic and regulatory strategies. Canada’s Prime Minister-designate, Mark Carney, previously expressed skepticism over Bitcoin’s viability, notably calling cryptocurrencies indicative of financial bubbles and limited in utility during a 2018 speech. Incoming Canadian PM Mark Carney On BTC Carney, who headed the Bank of England from 2013 to 2020, questioned Bitcoin’s viability at the Scottish Economics Conference at Edinburgh University in 2018 in a speech titled “The Future of Money.” https://twitter.com/liberal_party/status/1898864551551959478 Carney argued that cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin inherently possess serious economic deficiencies due to their fixed supply rules. “Far from being strengths, the fixed supply rules of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are serious deficiencies,” Carney said. “Fundamentally, they would impart a deflationary bias on the economy if such currencies were to be widely adopted.” Additionally, the former Bank of Canada head highlighted that prices of digital assets at the time exhibited “classic hallmarks of bubbles,” including increased retail enthusiasm, new paradigm justifications, and extrapolative price predictions. “The long, charitable answer is that cryptocurrencies act as money, at best, only for some people and to a limited extent, and even then only in parallel with the traditional currencies of the users,” he continued. “The short answer is they are failing.” Canada-U.S. Trade War Continues Carney’s comments resurfaced shortly after he won Canada’s federal election, replacing outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who announced his resignation two months ago. U.S. President Donald Trump has frequently dangled the carrot of costly tariffs against both Canada and Mexico in recent weeks in a bid to curb his concerns over alleged drug trafficking and inadequate border control measures connected to the two countries. Observers argue that the tariffs in question could be counterproductive to U.S. economic interests, with stocks dropping on Monday amid growing recession fears. https://twitter.com/FOX9/status/1899217731788132684 In his victory speech on Monday, Carney vowed to win the ongoing trade war with the U.S. , while President Trump has yet to respond. As Mark Carney prepares to take office, Canadians and global markets alike will closely monitor how his past skepticism towards cryptocurrencies influences his economic policies. Equally notable is how Carney navigates the delicate relationship with the United States amid escalating tariff tensions. Ultimately, his ability to manage these interconnected economic and diplomatic challenges may define both his tenure as Prime Minister and Canada’s financial landscape for years to come. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How might Carney’s historical stance on Bitcoin shape Canada’s digital currency regulation? Carney’s longstanding Bitcoin skepticism indicates he may endorse tighter crypto regulations. His policy focus appears aimed at protecting market stability and mitigating speculative risks in Canada’s financial system. What could be the broader economic effects if Carney implements stricter crypto oversight? Stricter crypto oversight may bolster Canada’s financial stability by curbing market volatility and excessive speculation, but could also temper the rapid growth of digital finance within an evolving global economy. How does global economic uncertainty impact Carney’s regulatory approach to digital finance? Facing global economic uncertainty, Carney advocates a cautious regulatory approach that limits exposure to volatile digital assets while upholding traditional financial safeguards amid market shifts.

We get attacked every day, but this was done with a lot of resources. Either a large, coordinated group and/or a country is involved. Tracing …” he wrote on X . In March 2023, the platform also experienced over an hour of glitches, as links stopped working, some users were unable to log in, and images did not load for others. Elon Musk faces cyberattacks, falling Tesla sales, and targeted vandalism Over the last few days, Elon Musk has been tackling a slew of problems across his businesses, X, Tesla, and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). He is growing increasingly suspicious that these are actually all part of a coordinated attack on his companies. Elon Musk explained the outages in terms of a “massive cyberattack” that, he said, took a lot of resources to carry out, perhaps implicating a large coordinated group or a state actor. He said the attack originated from IP addresses in the Ukraine region but did not offer evidence to support that assertion. At the same time, Tesla has been facing plummeting sales and public blowback. Recently, the company reported a 15% decrease in stock value. Tesla stores have also been the targets of vandalism and protests. For example, an AR-15-style rifle was used to attack a Tesla showroom in Salem, Oregon, in February, while four Tesla Cybertrucks in Seattle were set on fire. In an interview with Fox’s Larry Kudlow on Monday, billionaire Elon Musk admitted that his involvement with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Donald Trump’s initiative to reduce federal spending, is making it tougher to run his many businesses: X, Tesla, xAI, SpaceX, The Boring Company, and Starlink. #Teslatakedown protests escalate as Musk suggests coordinated attack Meanwhile, the incidents come on the heels of the #Teslatakedown movement that protests Musk’s role in the Trump administration as well as his management of DOGE. Demonstrators have staged sit-ins outside Tesla showrooms across the country, calling on consumers to stop buying Tesla products and divest from the company. While the convergence of events has spurred theories of a coordinated opposition to Musk’s endeavors, Musk himself chimed in affirmatively to a user that recent accusations, including protests against DOGE, attacks on Tesla stores, and the cyberattack on X, might all be connected. Details are still developing, but so far, there has been little evidence to link the incidents. Experts have warned against jumping to conclusions without thorough investigations. Nicholas Reese, an adjunct professor at New York University’s Center for Global Affairs, said a state conducting such a cyberattack was not likely, and the outages were relatively short-lived. He said technical data from X should support such claims. Elon Musk’s businesses are grappling with a wave of scrutiny, from hackers and public protesters to falling stock prices. Although Musk believes there’s an organized effort behind these occurrences, concrete proof has not materialized. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) said in a March 10 statement that it received 2,668 complaints in 2024 and found seven types of scams they didn’t have on record yet, such as fake Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining schemes, where fraudsters offer fake investments in mining. The DFPI also received complaints about fake crypto gaming schemes, where users are encouraged to deposit funds only to have their wallets drained , and fraudsters offering fake jobs that require victims to transfer crypto and provide private information. Source: California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation Victims also reported the theft of private keys through fake airdrops, fake investment group scams in WhatsApp or Telegram, AI Investment scams offering unusually high returns and losing their crypto after interacting with certain sham websites. The AI industry experienced significant growth in 2024 , reaching a market cap of $638 billion, according to Precedence Research. There was also a notable rise in crimeware-as-a-service (CaaS), where experienced hackers and cybercriminals sell their tools and services to less experienced offenders for a price. DFPI Commissioner KC Mohseni said the regulator is urging caution when interacting with unknown platforms and to “verify website domains to avoid fraudulent imitations, and stay wary of crypto recovery scam sites.” Through its partnership with the State, the DFPI says it shut down more than 26 fraudulent crypto websites and uncovered $4.6 million in user losses last year. California DOJ shuts down 42 crypto scam websites California’s Department of Justice (DOJ) took down 42 crypto scam websites in 2024 that stole $6.5 million from victims, with an average loss per person of $146,306. In a March 10 statement , the California DOJ said that because international fraudsters often carry out scams, they are difficult to prosecute and arrest. Common threads among the scam websites were promises of high returns, no contact information, offers of prizes for signing up, and no listings on legitimate crypto industry websites such as CoinMarketCap, the California DOJ said.

The stock, which trades under MicroStrategy, lost 17% on Monday, sinking to $239.27—a devastating drop from its $473.83 peak in November, according to data from Google Finance. The company has now lost nearly 50% of its value as economic uncertainty, Trump’s policies, and Bitcoin’s own struggles slam the crypto-focused firm. Saylor turned Strategy into a Bitcoin-heavy holding company, a decision that once excited investors looking for exposure to the crypto without directly buying it. The company’s plan to raise $42 billion through debt and stock sales to fund more Bitcoin purchases only added to the frenzy. But now, with the market turning sour, that approach is looking a lot riskier. Bitcoin’s drop and Trump’s policies are dragging Strategy down The sharp decline in Strategy’s stock comes as Bitcoin itself is losing momentum. The OG crypto fell by 4% on Monday, trading around $80,000, after the Trump administration confirmed that the planned Bitcoin reserve would not involve new purchases. Instead, the government will only use the tokens it already owns, allowing only budget-neutral strategies for acquiring more. That announcement killed the speculation that had been fueling Strategy’s rally. Investors had hoped that Trump’s return to office would mean massive government Bitcoin purchases, potentially boosting prices. Instead, they’re getting nothing. “There’s specifics to the crypto trade, and then there’s the overall risk trade, neither of which is particularly helpful for Bitcoin,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. He added that Strategy, as a highly leveraged Bitcoin proxy, is now in even deeper trouble. Trade wars, mass firings, and market chaos are piling on But it’s not just crypto. The entire market is under pressure, and Trump’s trade war is making things worse. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 900 points Monday, while the Nasdaq recorded its worst day since 2022 and the S&P 500 dropped 2.7%. The uncertainty started when Trump reimposed 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada, after briefly pausing them. That policy whiplash has spooked investors, adding to the broader fears about the economy. Meanwhile, inside the government, Elon Musk, a key Trump adviser, is leading an effort to fire thousands of federal employees. That shake-up is only adding to the instability. Markets that once cheered Trump’s economic approach are now backtracking, as investors see more unpredictability ahead. Trump, who once used stock market performance as a bragging point, has suddenly stopped talking about it. Instead, the White House is spinning a different story—that business leaders are still optimistic. “We’re seeing a strong divergence between the animal spirits of the stock market and what’s actually unfolding in business,” said a White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity, per a report from CNBC. Jim Cramer tells investors to not be scared over Monday’s stock selloff Some investors are no longer waiting around to see what happens. Wall Street is now bracing for a recession, and CNBC’s Jim Cramer says the market is terrified by Trump’s policy shifts. “Of course, not many investors saw this coming—and that’s incredible to me,” Jim said Monday. “Virtually overnight, they’ve decided that we’re headed for a recession, and it’s going to happen fast.” He compared the situation to Herbert Hoover, the president who worsened the Great Depression by raising tariffs. And he pointed to a new threat that’s freaking out tech investors: China’s DeepSeek, a startup that may have found a way to run AI technology cheaper and more efficiently than the current leaders. Tech stocks, which had been driving market gains, are now in retreat. Investors who rushed to buy “recession-proof” stocks on Monday ended up overpaying, according to Jim. Others got burned on panic-selling. Some traders, he said, “were ripped off on their buys”, as they scrambled to move money into safer investments. He warned against buying into the hype of recession-proof stocks too early and advised investors to focus on low-multiple techs, industrials, and banks. As for big tech giants, the so-called “Magnificent Seven”, Jimmy declared that the group “no longer exists” in the way it once did. That’s a major change in market sentiment and another sign that investors are rethinking everything. Jim also told investors to not let Monday’s sell-off “scare you out of the market entirely.” For now, Strategy’s fate remains directly linked to Bitcoin’s performance. If the crypto market continues to weaken, Saylor’s plan to fund future purchases with debt and stock sales could become a major liability. Investors aren’t willing to bet on Bitcoin at these levels, and that’s leaving Strategy in a vulnerable position. Right now, nobody is stepping in to save it.

Officials in the European Union (EU) are warning that Washington’s growing embrace of Bitcoin and dollar-backed stablecoins could seriously threaten Europe’s financial sovereignty. Pierre Gramegna, managing director of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), said Monday in Brussels that the U.S. stance on crypto raises concerns, especially as the European Central Bank (ECB) is still undecided on launching a digital euro. “The US administration is favorable toward cryptocurrencies and especially dollar-denominated stablecoins, which may raise certain concerns in Europe,” Gramegna told reporters. He warned that Trump’s push for crypto-backed financial tools could allow American and foreign tech giants to roll out mass payment systems based on stablecoins, potentially undermining the euro’s dominance. Trump moves forward with Bitcoin reserve Trump is not waiting for approval from anyone. Last week, he signed an executive order setting up a Bitcoin reserve and a second storage system for crypto assets seized through legal cases. The decision locks crypto into the U.S. government’s financial system, a major shift from past policies where officials treated it with suspicion. While the U.S. doubles down on crypto, Europe remains hesitant. The ECB has been developing a digital euro since 2021, but its final decision is still months away. Unlike the U.S., the ECB has refused to consider Bitcoin for its monetary reserves. Now, with Trump’s latest move, European leaders say they need to accelerate their work to prevent financial instability in the region. “The digital euro is today more necessary than ever,” Gramegna said, backing the ECB’s urgency. The ESM believes the EU must launch the digital euro soon to protect its monetary autonomy. Not everyone in Europe agrees on how to handle crypto. Christine Lagarde, president of the ECB, made it clear in January that Bitcoin will never be part of the EU’s official reserves. “I’m confident that Bitcoins will not enter the reserves of any of the central banks of the General Council,” Lagarde said. She was responding to statements from Ales Michl, governor of the Czech National Bank (CNB), who said his institution might explore Bitcoin investments in December 2024. The Czech Republic is part of the EU but doesn’t use the euro. Still, Michl’s comments caused enough of a stir that Lagarde had to address them. She emphasized that ECB policymakers agree on keeping reserves liquid, secure, and free from risks like money laundering. “I had a good conversation with my colleague from the Czech Republic and I leave it to him to make whatever announcement he wants to make,” Lagarde said. But she insisted that the ECB will not accept Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Czech National Bank considered crypto for a second Michl confirmed in an interview with the Financial Times in December that the bank is looking into the possibility of adding Bitcoin to its reserves, with a potential allocation of 5%. He later clarified on X that discussions were still in the early stages. On January 28, the Czech finance minister expressed concerns about the idea, whilst hinting a bit at division within the country’s leadership. Meanwhile, the CNB’s seven-member policy board approved a plan to analyze new investment options, though they didn’t directly mention crypto. “At the proposal of Governor Ales Michl, the CNB is to assess whether it would be appropriate in terms of diversification and return to include other asset classes,” the board said in a statement. No final decision has been made, and changes won’t happen until the analysis is complete. Not everyone is convinced that Bitcoin belongs in national reserves. Last month, Christian Lindner, former German finance minister, floated the idea of using Bitcoin as a reserve asset, but the reaction was mostly negative. Joachim Nagel, president of Germany’s Bundesbank, literally Bitcoin to the tulip mania that crashed the Dutch economy in the 1600s. “Reserve assets must be secure, liquid, and transparent,” Nagel said. “Bitcoin is none of these things.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Market analysts believe certain economic factors could trigger a strong rebound amid these concerns. Crypto expert and Abra CEO Bill Barhydt has pointed to key macroeconomic trends that could drive the expected Bitcoin price resurgence. The Economic Thesis to Fuel Bitcoin Price Growth According to his latest X post, Bill Barhydt remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s direction despite the market correction. He sounded confident about this position as he compared this recent development to previous cycles. Bill noted that this pullback follows the same pattern in 2017. For context, market data pointed out that rising fiat liquidity increased asset prices. Similarly, the Abra CEO suggested President Donald Trump’s administration would likely introduce 3 key monetary policies. This includes lowering treasury rates to refinance debt, lowering mortgage rates to unlock housing and credit markets, and lowering the treasury to save banks from mass insolvency. He added that China’s economic struggles could lead to further U.S. rate cuts, which may reinforce global liquidity flows. Barhydt states these factors likely fuel a strong BTC price recovery. Some models predict Bitcoin could reach as high as $713,000 in the next six months if market conditions align. Crypto Market Outlook Due to the fragile digital asset economy, the market has seen terrific crypto liquidations in recent times. The Bitcoin price decline has triggered widespread sell-offs, with major institutional holders facing substantial losses. Notably, Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which holds the largest share of Bitcoin in circulation, has seen the value of its holdings drop. Per reports, it dropped from $21.2 billion to approximately $17.3 billion. Yet, the Abra CEO is encouraging the market not to be distressed. Bill added that this correction differs from previous market cycles, where Bitcoin has gained more value after similar downturns. For him, if history teaches anything, as liquidity increases and investor confidence stabilizes, the crypto market will soon recover. Policy and Regulatory Shifts It is important to state that regulatory and policy changes in the U.S. could also play a crucial role in Bitcoin’s next major move. For example, President Donald Trump’s executive order introduced a strategic Bitcoin reserve , utilizing seized digital assets. Likewise, the recent friendliness of the US security agency, featuring the dismissal of the Kraken lawsuit and other crypto firms, teases a clearer crypto framework could be in play. However, while Bitcoin price faces short-term volatility, the convergence of economic stimulus, historical market resilience, and evolving regulatory frameworks suggests the potential for a strong recovery. Analysts believe that if liquidity trends hold and institutional investments continue, Bitcoin could soon re-enter a bullish phase.

The recent decline has pushed the leading cryptocurrency below the 200-day moving average (MA), raising concerns about a potential deeper pullback. Bitcoin Must Defend This Key Price Level According to an X post by seasoned crypto analyst Ali Martinez, BTC is now trading below the 200-day MA, a key price level that has historically functioned as a strong support for the top digital asset. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sellers Incur Loss As SOPR Drops To 0.95 – A Sign Of Market Bottom? For the uninitiated, the 200-day MA is a famous technical indicator that essentially represents the average closing price of BTC over the last 200 days to identify the long-term price trend. Historically, a sustained movement above the 200-day MA has led to long-term uptrends while a prolonged price movement below the level has often preceded further declines. Martinez stressed that BTC must remain above the TD Sequential indicator’s risk line at $79,280. He added that a sustained move above this level could set the stage for a strong rebound to the upside. The potential for a BTC recovery was echoed by fellow crypto analyst Ted. In a post on X, he pointed out that over the past two years, BTC has frequently undergone 25% to 30% corrections before rebounding to new all-time highs (ATHs). Ted noted: In 2023, BTC went from $30K to $22K. In 2024, BTC went from $74K to $50K. This year, BTC has dumped from $109K to $79K. We all know what happened after the last 2 major corrections. If BTC follows a similar pattern and climbs 30% from its current price, it could reach approximately $104,000 in a short period. However, broader macroeconomic factors – such as US President Donald Trump’s trade tariffs and the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) monetary policy – could significantly impact BTC’s trajectory. BTC Needs To Reclaim $84,000 First In another post on X, Martinez outlined BTC’s potential path to a new ATH, emphasizing that BTC must first reclaim $84,000 as a support level before any major upside movement. Once this milestone is secured, the digital asset could rally toward $128,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Fills CME Gap Between $78,000 and $80,000 – Is A Reversal Around The Corner? Several indicators suggest that BTC may have already found a local bottom, increasing the chances of a trend reversal. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital recently noted that BTC’s plunge to $78,258 could mark the cycle low. Additionally, the US Dollar Index (DXY) has just recorded one of its largest weekly breakdowns since 2013, a move that historically signals bullish momentum for risk-on assets like BTC. At press time, BTC trades at $80,137, down 3.5% in the past 24 hours.

Beyond the usual buzz around Bitcoin and Ethereum, discerning investors are turning their attention to a fresh lineup of altcoins that might offer outsized rewards. While the crypto scene is replete with fleeting trends, only a select few coins demonstrate the robust fundamentals, increasing adoption, and tangible applications that could lead to significant market breakthroughs. At the forefront of these promising crypto ventures is Web3Bay, accompanied by other solid contenders like Solana, XRP, Hedera, and Sui, all poised for significant attention. Web3Bay (3BAY) – Revolutionizing Market Transactions with Blockchain In an era where giants such as Amazon and eBay dominate with steep fees and centralized control, Web3Bay is carving a niche in the decentralized market landscape. This platform is engineered to offer a secure, transparent, and cost-effective trading space, granting users complete authority over their dealings and personal information. Far from the fleeting allure of meme coins, Web3Bay addresses genuine challenges by cutting out the middlemen in online transactions. The excitement from investors about Web3Bay is palpable. Its presale has successfully garnered over $1.6 million, selling over 400 million tokens, making it a standout in this year’s early-stage crypto initiatives. Its structured pricing strategy promotes gradual growth, with the current presale rate at $0.00524, a 15% increase from the previous price of $0.00456. With continuing demand, many market analysts are touting Web3Bay as potentially one of the top performers in 2025, possibly yielding returns up to 500 times for those who invest early. Solana (SOL) – Pioneering Speed and Efficiency in Blockchain Technology Solana continues to assert its dominance in the blockchain arena with its incredibly fast transactions and minimal fees. It ranks as a leading Layer-1 network, drawing interest from NFT creators, DeFi communities, and large-scale investors in search of a scalable blockchain foundation. With the market buzzing, Solana is on the brink of what could be a significant upswing, with market experts eyeing the $200 mark as a critical threshold. As more developers gravitate towards Solana’s platform, the investment community is poised for potentially record-setting gains in SOL. XRP (XRP) – Expanding Reach in the Financial Sector The appeal of XRP grows as more institutional players delve into this digital asset. Brazil’s recent approval of the first spot ETF for XRP has sparked conversations about possible U.S. approval, revitalizing interest in the currency. With XRP’s price still below its historic peaks, investors see a prime opportunity for substantial returns in the forthcoming market upswing. As Bitcoin’s ascent continues, market forecasters suggest XRP could achieve new heights, positioning it as a top altcoin to invest in for substantial, long-term rewards. Hedera (HBAR) – Securing the Future with Advanced Blockchain Solutions Hedera distinguishes itself with its hashgraph consensus mechanism, enhancing speed, security, and efficiency beyond traditional blockchain systems. This technology has garnered the attention of global giants like Google, IBM, and Boeing, who are integrating Hedera’s solutions for high-level applications. As Hedera expands its footprint in DeFi and tokenization, it’s increasingly viewed as one of the market’s top altcoins to invest in due to its underestimated potential. With its continued adoption and strategic alliances, market analysts recommend HBAR as a pivotal addition to any forward-thinking crypto investment portfolio. Sui (SUI) – Redefining Scalability in Blockchain Platforms Sui is making waves in the realm of smart contracts by offering a platform that is both efficient and scalable for developers. Setting itself apart from Ethereum and Solana, Sui avoids the common pitfall of network congestion by implementing parallel transaction processing, which enhances its scalability. Despite some volatility in its price, the Sui ecosystem is on an upward trajectory with a continuous influx of new projects and DeFi applications. As adoption keeps increasing, Sui is poised to be a top altcoin to invest in and one of the standout Layer-1 networks in 2025, making it a valuable asset for any diversified crypto investment strategy. Final Insights – Spotlight on Web3Bay’s Potential While Solana, XRP, Hedera, and Sui each present considerable investment opportunities, Web3Bay stands out as the front-runner for 2025. Its decentralized approach to e-commerce, coupled with a booming presale and growing market acceptance, sets the stage for potential monumental growth in the near future. For investors aiming to capitalize on their investments, Web3Bay should be considered before its next anticipated price surge. This presents a unique chance to get involved early in one of the most rapidly expanding crypto presales. Are you prepared to claim your stake in what could be the most lucrative phase of this top altcoin to invest in? Don’t miss your chance to be part of this exciting growth journey.

It is true that Cramer said there are situations where getting away from the market makes sense, but when he was advising about getting out at the Haines Bottom, he said he said it in the context of investors taking their money in the next five years. He acknowledged that the market went down significantly from when he first issued the warning but emphasized that those who began buying near the market bottom had strong returns over time. The recent market maelstrom has been fed by a mix of forces—from concerns over rising inflation to Federal Reserve interest rate policy to geopolitical anxiety. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq have been hit hard in recent weeks, with technology stocks suffering particularly sharply. Investors are also considering hesitation over earnings reports and fears of a global economic slowdown. As crazy as it gets, Cramer still swears by his long-term belief that long-term investors should own high-quality stocks while not panic-selling every time the market goes south. He highlighted historical comebacks following prior sell-offs, such as the COVID-19 market crash of 2020, when markets rebounded sharply after reaching the bottom. Cramer highlights buying opportunities in the tech and defensive sectors Shares of mega-cap tech names such as Apple, Microsoft, and Meta — and have all recently been sold off — “still have good fundamentals,” Cramer said, and “might represent the kind of buying opportunity you’ll want long-term.” He also emphasized defensive sectors that tend to do well in turbulent economic times, like healthcare, consumer staples, and energy. Cramer noted that people should invest in the stock of quality companies to benefit more significantly over a longer period of time. He noted that the vast majority of gains in the market happen on just several key days each year. He warned investors against trying to time the market, as missing those key recovery days can have a big impact on long-term returns. Ending market declines follow a historical pattern in which markets eventually recover from downturns. The Haines Bottom of 2009 is an excellent example of how investor psychology can change at the drop of a hat, giving rise to large gains for those who remained invested. “Think of it like this: days like today are what kept you out of the big gains in the same stocks. Most people never get back,” he said. “They don’t buy, they forget, or they think that they can’t tempt fate or the market’s too brutal.” Jonny Cramer Cramer’s message when he said it: While the market sell-off now is troubling, history teaches that continuing to invest in strong companies pays off over time.

Or watched Shiba Inu skyrocket while you sat on the sidelines? If you’ve been waiting for the next big short-term crypto play, now’s your chance to act. The meme coin market is booming, and some projects are showing signs of serious growth. Right now, BTFD Coin ($BTFD) is the talk of the town with its highly rewarding referral program and presale momentum. With over $6.28 million already raised, this presale is closing fast, and early investors are locking in their spots before the price jumps. Alongside BTFD, Dogwifhat ($WIF), Floki Inu ($FLOKI), and Brett ($BRETT) are also gaining traction in the crypto space. If you’re looking for the best cryptos to buy for short term , these four deserve a closer look. BTFD Coin: The Referral Program That’s Rewarding Early Investors Big Time BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme token—it’s building a movement while giving investors multiple ways to earn. One of its most exciting features is its referral program, which allows holders to earn free $BTFD tokens by spreading the word. Here’s how it works: For every person who uses your referral code to buy $50+ in BTFD, they get an extra 10% bonus in tokens. You, as the referrer, earn 10% of their purchase amount in BTFD coins at the end of the month if you rank in the top 20 referrers. The leaderboard resets on the 1st of each month, meaning new investors always have a shot at earning big rewards. Now, let’s talk about the presale. BTFD Coin is currently in Stage 14, priced at $0.00016 per token. With over 71 billion tokens sold and 11,300+ holders, momentum is building fast. And here’s the kicker—analysts predict a $0.0006 listing price, meaning early investors could see a 3.75X return at launch. But what happens if BTFD Coin reaches its predicted moon price of $0.006? A $9,000 investment today at $0.00016 would give you 56.25 million BTFD tokens. If the price climbs to $0.0006 at launch, that investment could be worth $33,750. And if it skyrockets to $0.006, you’d be sitting on a massive $337,500. Why did this coin make it to this list? BTFD Coin’s referral program, booming presale, and insane upside potential make it one of the best cryptos to buy for short term gains. How to Buy BTFD Coins? To grab BTFD before the presale closes, set up MetaMask or Trust Wallet, load it with BNB or ETH, and visit the BTFD presale page to purchase. The earlier you buy, the more tokens you secure at this low price. Dogwifhat: The Solana Meme Coin That’s Dominating the Charts Dogwifhat ($WIF) started as a meme, but quickly became a Solana powerhouse. This coin has gained massive community support, fueled by its simple yet catchy branding. WIF is a pure meme coin, but its strong trading volume and hype cycle have kept it in the spotlight. Since launching, WIF has consistently ranked among the top Solana-based meme coins, proving that meme culture and community backing are enough to push a project forward. It has no roadmap or utility, but that hasn’t stopped traders from betting big on its short-term potential. Why did this coin make it to this list? Dogwifhat’s rapid rise, massive trading volume, and Solana’s ecosystem growth make it a solid choice for short-term gains. Floki Inu: The Utility-Packed Meme Coin With DeFi Potential Floki Inu ($FLOKI) isn’t just a meme—it’s a full-fledged ecosystem. Launched by Shiba Inu community members, FLOKI has carved out its niche by integrating DeFi, NFTs, and metaverse utilities into its platform. What makes FLOKI stand out? FlokiFi – A decentralized finance (DeFi) platform for staking and earning. Valhalla Metaverse – A play-to-earn gaming experience. Massive global community, thanks to its branding and marketing campaigns. With major exchange listings and ongoing ecosystem development, FLOKI has positioned itself as more than just a meme—it’s an investment with multiple growth angles. Why did this coin make it to this list? Floki Inu combines meme power with real DeFi and metaverse utility, giving it strong short-term and long-term upside. Brett: The Meme Coin That’s Taking Over Base Chain Brett ($BRETT) has quickly become the mascot of Base Chain, the Layer 2 blockchain developed by Coinbase. Inspired by Matt Furie’s Boys’ Club comics, Brett has gained cult-like community support, leading to explosive price action. What makes Brett interesting is that it’s heavily tied to Base Chain’s success. With Coinbase backing Base and meme coin traders flocking to the chain, BRETT has positioned itself as the leading meme project in that ecosystem. The fixed supply of 10 billion tokens also adds a deflationary aspect, making each token more valuable as demand increases. Why did this coin make it to this list? Brett’s cultural relevance, strong community backing, and connection to Base Chain make it a potential short-term moonshot. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, these are the best cryptos to buy for short term if you’re looking for quick, high-potential gains. Dogwifhat is thriving in the Solana ecosystem, Floki Inu is expanding its DeFi and metaverse reach, and Brett is becoming the face of Base Chain. But if you’re looking for a short-term play with immediate rewards, BTFD Coin is the one to watch. With its 10% referral rewards, booming presale, and strong post-launch predictions, it offers multiple ways to earn fast. The presale won’t last forever—Stage 14 is almost sold out, and once the next stage kicks in, the price will go up. If you want to secure BTFD at $0.00016 before the next price increase, now is the time to act. Join the BTFD Coin presale now before it’s too late. FAQs What makes BTFD Coin different from other meme coins? BTFD Coin has a highly rewarding referral program, a live P2E game, and 90% APY staking rewards, making it one of the best cryptos to buy for short term gains. How does the BTFD referral program work? Users earn 10% in free BTFD tokens when they refer buyers, and if they rank in the top 20 referrers, they get an additional bonus at the end of the month. Is Dogwifhat a good short-term investment? Dogwifhat has seen massive growth in the Solana ecosystem, and with strong trading volume, it remains a popular meme coin for short-term trading.

This Altcoin Is Ready To Surpass DOGE in 2025,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/missed-dogecoin-doge-back-in-the-day-this-altcoin-is-ready-to-surpass-doge-in-2025/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) valued at $0.04 when Elon Musk launched his viral tweet expanded to reach a maximum of $0.074 during 2021. The downturn of DOGE value since its high mark of $0.7376 leads the market toward a new emerging token built for continuous growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has succeeded as a decentralized lending protocol to attract investors who did not participate in the Dogecoin rally. Mutuum Finance awaits buyers at $0.015 during Phase 2 of its presale. The project has gained over $2.7 million from about 4,900 investors. The strong 85% completion rate of Phase 2 gives analysts confidence that MUTM will surpass meme coins including DOGE by 2025 because it has real-world application and systematic tokenomics. The second phase of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale maintains strong momentum The popularity of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) does not stem from viral trends. The presale process of MUTM depends on decentralized lending which unites overcollateralized loans along with peer-to-peer negotiations and revenue-sharing components. The presale’s second phase starts at $0.015 while promising early buyers a 33% profit when Phase 3 launches at $0.02. The exchange listing price of the token stands at $0.06 after its presale process which initiates at $0.015 but eventually reaches $0.06. This valuation brings 300% growth according to current market rates. The current value of $1,000 investment stands to become $4,000 during Phase 3 launch. MUTM anticipates rapid price appreciation to between $3.50 and $5 during the next few months as more users join the platform based on post-listing expert estimates. The mtTokens system embedded within the protocol enhances its offer to users. People who deposit ETH or DAI into the protocol can receive interest-bearing mtETH or mtDAI tokens that retain transferability throughout all DeFi platforms. The system offers dual functionality for earning passive income while still maintaining liquidity in ways that differ fundamentally from how Dogecoin works since it depends on social media trends. MUTM investors receive dividends from platform fees since a part of these fees automatically purchases MUTM tokens which are distributed to stakers thus reducing the risk of sell-offs. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Ecosystem Incentivizes Long-Term Holding Mutuum Finance (MUTM establishes mechanisms which prevent the problems associated with short-term speculation activities. MUTM embraces community engagement by giving its first ten participants $10,000 each from its $100,000 presale giveaway funds yet it avoids excessive token promotion. Secured overcollateralized lending on MUTM registers as a feature which attracts lenders who prioritize protection against defaults. The P2P system through MUTM allows borrowers to access loans with terms that offer the option for DOGE and SHIB transactions which standard pools normally do not support. MUTM’s growth path will be strengthened by the implementation of Tokenomics. Following presale distribution the released supply will remain at 20% which creates scarcity throughout the market. Surging prices are predicted due to both scarce token economics and the buy-and-distribute model. Buyers who purchased MUTM tokens during presale at $0.015 might earn substantial gains of up to 23,233% if the project reaches $3.50 within the market because analysts predict such high potential based on revenue-based token burns and rising user numbers. Time is critical. The fast speed at which Phase 2 fills funds demonstrates the same sense of emergency that led Phase 1 to sell out in a few days. The period to acquire MUTM at presale rates before exchange listings becomes shorter by the day. Investors who passed up on DOGE during its historic rise are turning their attention to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) because they understand its combination of DeFi development and massive financial returns. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently duplicating Dogecoin’s initial market gains after eliminating its usual price fluctuations in the crypto market. MUTM possesses the potential to outperform DOGE as well as reinvent DeFi investment criteria through its operational framework combined with its visible token distribution structure alongside continuous buy-driven market activity. Purchase your tokens now since Phase 3 will launch another price increase in the market.

The order is expected to address regulatory policies that limited crypto companies’ access to banking services, according to sources familiar with the matter. Donald Trump Executive Order on Crypto Banking Barriers The upcoming Donald Trump executive order is expected to roll back rules linked to “Operation Chokepoint 2.0,” a term used to describe efforts that allegedly pressured banks to deny services to crypto-related businesses. The initiative, widely discussed by industry leaders, suggested that the previous administration discouraged financial institutions from working with the crypto sector. White House officials confirmed that steps are being taken to remove these restrictions. Bo Hines, Executive Director of the Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets, stated, “I think that the industry can expect something in short order there.” However, specific details regarding the content of the executive order have not yet been disclosed. Potential Changes to Federal Reserve Policies The Donald Trump executive order may also target Federal Reserve policies that restricted crypto-focused banks from obtaining master accounts. These accounts allow banks to transact directly with the Federal Reserve and are essential for operating nationwide. During the Biden administration, banks like Custodia were denied master accounts, limiting their ability to offer financial services to crypto firms. Despite increasing calls for change, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) have not yet rescinded any anti-crypto guidance. Last month, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged concerns over crypto debanking , stating that he was “struck” by the growing number of cases and that the Fed would take a “fresh look” at the issue. Custodia Bank CEO Caitlin Long has criticized the Fed and FDIC for their approach to crypto banking, stating that they were “far more detrimental to crypto banking” than the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), which recently rescinded its restrictive crypto banking guidance. Elizabeth Warren Signals Support for Crypto Banking Access Senator Elizabeth Warren, has also expressed a willingness to work with the Trump administration to address debanking issues. During a recent Senate Banking Committee hearing, Warren stated, “Debanking is a real problem. This shouldn’t be happening, and we need to fix it.” Her position represents a shift in her approach to cryptocurrency regulation. While she has previously advocated for stricter oversight, Warren now appears to support ensuring that banks do not deny services to crypto firms without clear justification. Trump’s Continued Focus on Cryptocurrency Policy This Donald Trump executive order would be the third related to cryptocurrency since Trump returned to office. The first order, signed in January, established the Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets. The second, signed last week, directed the creation of a U.S. government strategic Bitcoin reserve and a separate digital asset stockpile. Reports suggest that the upcoming order may include provisions related to stablecoins, stating that they should not be classified as securities. If signed, this order could introduce major regulatory changes affecting the cryptocurrency industry, particularly in the banking sector. A senior White House official stated that legal considerations are being reviewed before the order is finalized. While no specific date has been confirmed, sources suggest the signing could take place within the week.

Higher yields are said to signal market optimism traditionally, but Japan’s current economic situation on the ground has everyday residents worried about a massive downturn. Japan 10-year government bond yields hit a peak not seen since the 2008 economic downturn on Monday, as big investors signaled confidence in the market, expecting further interest rate hikes from the Bank of Japan (BoJ) and greater stabilization. The BoJ previously raised the benchmark rate by 25 basis points in January, to the current level of 0.5% — a level not seen in 17 years. The bond yield rate tapped a high of 1.591% at 3:40 p.m. (JST). Typically, investors flee to perceived low-risk assets like government bonds in times of economic uncertainty, or when inflation — and its subsequent remedial rate hikes — is expected. As the short-term, central bank-dictated interest rate rises, however, holders of older bonds with lower yield rates locked in have a hard time selling them, as market actors can now enter and buy new bonds with a higher yield, resulting in prices for these securities being forced downward. Japan’s benchmark yield rate for 10-year government bonds hit its highest levels since 2008 on Monday. Source: MarketWatch. Further, markets being flooded with money can coincide with increasing yields. This is likely what happened back in 2008 , after the U.S. government intervened to bail out the banking industry. Investor confidence in riskier assets returned, money exited back into the wider market, and bond prices fell as their yields inversely climbed, incentivizing investment back into these long-term securities. What the rising bond rate means for Japan While Japan’s 10-year government bond yield rate has cooled slightly at the time of writing, some market watchers, like CEO of SBI Global Asset Management Tomoya Asakura, say the rate could reach levels as high as 2%. Asakura noted on social media platform X (translated): “The 10-year yen bond yield has reached a level not seen since the Lehman Shock, with a 2.0% yield in sight.” He continued by stating that “The market is not yet prepared for this impact.” Asakura fears the impact of “rising borrowing costs” for businesses and consumers, as well as the effects of a stronger yen on export companies. Further, the CEO predicts an increase in the interest payment burden on the BoJ for yen bonds held by the institution. Asakura’s post on X. More fiscally conservative voices view the tightening as a positive signal, while on the ground, everyday residents of the archipelago continue to suffer under both hawkish and dovish policies, regardless. Whether by way of a stronger JPY and attendant higher borrowing costs, or a weaker yen and continued out-of-control inflation, it looks like things will invariably get harder for low-wage earners. If Asakura’s warnings come true, the result could even be a 2008-style market collapse. Trading Economics detailed the bond yield surge, reporting on data from January: “Inflation-adjusted real wages—a key measure of consumer purchasing power—fell 1.8% year-on-year, marking the first decline in three months.” Notably, Japan is also facing a challenging influx of tourists , incentivized by state-sponsored benefits such as free domestic air travel, making it harder for locals to live economically viable lives even in their own communities.

Doing so increases the likelihood that the US won’t need to refinance around $7 trillion in debt it owes over the next few months, Bitcoin commentator Anthony Pompliano said in a March 10 X post. US President Donald Trump and Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent are “taking matters into their own hands; they’re crashing asset prices in an attempt to force Jerome Powell to cut interest rates,” said Pompliano, who serves as the founder and CEO of Professional Capital Management and host of The Pomp Podcast. In late January, Powell announced the Fed was not lowering interest rates from the current target range of 4.25% to 4.5% despite calls from Trump to do so. Pompliano said the recent market panic has been driven in part by Trump’s tariffs — and has been used to create a more favorable bond market while lowering the 10-year Treasury yield. He noted that the 10-year Treasury yield is already down from nearly 4.8% in January to 4.21% now — a sign that Trump’s purported strategy is “heading in the right direction.” Source: Thomas Kralow Whether Pompliano’s theory is correct or not, the stock market has been tanking of late, and crypto has been hit even harder. Broad market index funds such as State Street’s Standard & Poor’s 500 index fund (SPY) fell 2.66% on March 10 alone, while the Nasdaq-100% fell 3.8%, Google Finance data shows. Both indexes are down 7.32% and 10.7% over the last month, while Bitcoin ( BTC ) is down 27.4% from its $108,786 all-time high, and over $1.2 trillion has been wiped from the cryptocurrency market cap since Dec. 17. If the stock market continues to tank, it will come down to a “who blinks first” contest between Trump and Powell, Pompliano said. While Trump hasn’t confirmed such a strategy, Pompliano pointed to a Fox News interview on March 9 where Trump said: “Nobody ever gets rich when the interest rates are high because people can’t borrow money.” Pompliano added that lowering interest rates would also benefit American consumers: “The big goal, get interest rates down, and that will lead to more economic activity, thanks to access to cheap capital. Give the people cheap capital and they’ll go and do things with it.” Related: Bitcoin dips to $80K in ‘ugly start,’ could retest key resistance: Hayes CME FedWatch, a tool used to measure expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate change, has tipped a 96% probability that the target rate will remain between 4.25% and 4.50% following the Federal Reserve’s next meeting on March 19. However, it’s near 50-50 odds for the target rate to be lowered in the Federal Reserve’s following meeting on May 7. The Federal Reserve typically avoids lowering interest rates when inflation is high , as one of its primary objectives is to maintain price stability. However, a Trump-inflicted recession, or “Trumpcession,” as some call it, could force America’s top bank to start cutting again.

The order is expected to target policies under “Operation Chokepoint 2.0,” which seeks to roll back these restrictions and support the crypto industry. Bo Hines, Executive Director of the White House’s Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets, confirmed that administrative action is coming but didn’t provide details. He mentioned that the industry can expect something in soon. Hines also emphasized that the Trump administration aims to end practices linked to “Operation Chokepoint 2.0,” a term coined by Nic Carter, which refers to efforts similar to the Obama-era Operation Choke Point that targeted payday lenders and gun dealers. Trump’s Executive Order Could Open Fed Access to Crypto Banks While details of Trump’s executive order are still being finalized, it could impact Federal Reserve policies on master accounts. These accounts, held by federally chartered banks, are essential for making direct payments and accessing the Fed’s services. Under the Biden administration, the Fed denied master accounts to crypto-focused banks like Custodia, hindering their growth. Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett remarked that this is significant because the Federal Reserve and the FDIC have not yet reversed any anti-crypto policies, even though Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell mentioned last month that he was concerned by the increasing number of crypto debanking cases and that the Fed would “take a fresh look” at the issue. https://twitter.com/EleanorTerrett/status/1899213132272447631 Trump Administration Pushes Forward Despite Challenges While the Federal Reserve operates independently from the White House, the Trump administration is pushing forward with its crypto order, despite potential legal hurdles. Sources note that senior White House officials are set to meet Thursday to assess possible challenges before putting the order on Trump’s desk. However, a White House official denied any such meeting is scheduled but confirmed that efforts to roll back Operation Chokepoint 2.0 are already in motion. The race to reshape crypto policy is heating up, and all eyes are on what comes next. Directive on Stablecoins? The upcoming executive order could extend beyond banking, and might include a directive stating that stablecoins, which are designed to maintain a stable value and are typically pegged to the U.S. dollar, should not be classified as securities. If Trump signs this order, it would be his third crypto-related executive action since returning to office. The first, signed on January 23, created a Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets. The second, signed last week, ordered the establishment of a U.S. government Bitcoin reserve and a separate stockpile for other digital assets. Bitcoin Dips Despite The Develoments Trump’s recent Crypto Summit disappointed industry leaders, with his Bitcoin reserve plan failing to boost the market as the administration plans to use seized assets. Broader economic policies, including tariffs on China and others, have also shaken markets. As a result, institutional investors pulled funds from Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, causing Bitcoin to fall below $80,000 for the first time in 4 months and Ethereum to drop to $1,870.",News|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,FIAT|REGULATION|BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS|ETH,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-11 02:19:47

That’s a 30% decline from its all-time high of $110,000, and the sell-off isn’t just hitting crypto—stocks are also in freefall. But according to Arthur Hayes, traders need to wait it out. “The plan: Be fucking patient,” Hayes said in a post on X. He predicted Bitcoin would likely bottom at $70,000, which would be a 36% correction from its peak—something he called “very normal for a bull market.” But he made it clear that crypto isn’t bouncing back on its own. Hayes said the next steps were for stocks to crash, a major traditional finance institution to go under, and central banks to start printing money again before things turn around. “Then you load up the truck,” he said . BTC price chart. Source: Jai Hamid/TradingView Stock market tanks while Bitcoin slides This crash isn’t just a Bitcoin problem. The Nasdaq 100 dropped 1,050 points in a single day, a 5.8% loss, and after-hours trading saw another 300-point drop. If the market had stayed open, it would have been just 1.2% away from a circuit breaker halt, something that only happens when things are in full panic mode. Futures trading isn’t looking any better. S&P 500 futures slipped 0.4%, Nasdaq-100 futures fell 0.9%, and Dow Jones futures dropped slightly, down 20 points. But Delta Air Lines took the biggest hit, plunging 11% after-hours after slashing its profit and sales forecast due to weak U.S. travel demand. SPX S&P 500 Index chart. Source: TradingView Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has now logged three consecutive losing weeks, with Monday’s session adding to the pain. The Dow Jones lost nearly 900 points, falling below its 200-day moving average for the first time since November 1, 2023. The Nasdaq Composite had its worst day since September 2022. “This is starting to feel like a capitulation in the market,” said Anastasia Amoroso, chief investment strategist at iCapital, on CNBC’s Closing Bell. She said markets were reaching oversold levels, predicting that things would either hit rock bottom immediately or sometime this week. Peter Schiff slams Bitcoin, investors wait for economic data Peter Schiff, known for his anti-Bitcoin stance, wasted no time in trashing crypto after the latest drop. “Now that Bitcoin fell below $77K, it’s down 30% from its January record high,” Schiff wrote on X. He questioned how the U.S. government could consider Bitcoin as a reserve asset when it can lose value so quickly. “The rationale will be even harder to see when it’s down 50%,” he added. Schiff then tied the crash to U.S. manufacturing, saying that with crypto millionaires losing money, the country would need to bring back industrial jobs. Investors are now bracing for key economic reports this week. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) comes out on Tuesday, followed by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Wednesday and the Producer Price Index (PPI) on Thursday. These reports could decide whether inflation fears will push the Federal Reserve toward more aggressive rate cuts. Market volume also spiked during Monday’s trading session. More than 82% of stocks on the Nasdaq ended the day in the red, while 76% of New York Stock Exchange stocks also dropped. Declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones 4 to 1, and new 52-week lows on the Nasdaq hit 413, compared to just 69 new highs. Meanwhile, crypto-related stocks collapsed. Coinbase dropped 17.6%, Robinhood fell 19.8%, and MicroStrategy, now rebranded as Strategy, saw its stock price tank by 16%. Bitcoin ETFs see outflows, Trump comments on recession The Bitcoin ETF market has also taken a beating. Outflows totaled $867 million last week, making it the fourth straight week of withdrawals, according to CoinShares. That brings the total four-week outflows to $4.75 billion, as bearish sentiment continues to push prices down. The broader crypto market took another hit over the weekend, with Bitcoin briefly dropping to $80,000 for the first time since February 28th. Adding to the uncertainty, Donald Trump weighed in on the economy during a Fox News interview, calling it a “period of transition.” His comments followed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s statement that the U.S. could go through a “detox period” as the administration cuts federal spending. Source: Farside Goldman Sachs has also revised its economic growth forecast downward, citing concerns over Trump’s tariff policies. But despite all the chaos, Amoroso dismissed recession fears, pointing to strong payroll reports and steady consumer spending at 3-4%. Still, the combination of a weak stock market, crypto outflows, and uncertainty in macroeconomics has traders on edge. Many are waiting for central banks to step in, just like Hayes predicted. The Federal Reserve, the PBOC, the ECB, and the BOJ could all be forced to ease policies to support their economies. For now, though, the message from Hayes is clear: Wait.

Senate Passes Bill, But Makes Key Amendment",https://bitcoinist.com/utahs-bitcoin-strategic-reserve-race-over-senate-passes-bill-but-makes-key-amendment/,"Utah’s State Senate has exited the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) race after amending the proposed bill allowing the state treasury to invest in digital assets. The amended legislation is now headed to Utah Governor Spencer Cox’s desk to be signed into law. Utah Passes Bitcoin Bill Without Key Clause On March 7, Utah’s senate passed House Bill 230 (HB230), also known as the “Blockchain and Digital Innovation Amendments.” However, the state lawmakers amended the legislation to scrap the clause allowing the state to invest in digital assets. The legislation initially authorized the state treasurer to invest up to 5% of certain public reserve funds in “qualifying digital assets” and established requirements for their custody and management. To be considered for investment, a digital asset must have maintained a market capitalization of more than $500 billion over the past 12 months and not be a stablecoin. Bitcoin was the only cryptocurrency that met these requirements. Utah Representative Jordan Teuscher introduced HB230 on January 21 and passed the House of Representatives vote 8-1 before proceeding to the Senate’s first reading. The bill passed the Senate Revenue and Taxation Committee reading on February 20 in a 4-2-1 vote and moved to the second and third reading in the full Senate. After passing the second reading, the Senate dropped the Reserve clause on its third reading over “a lot of concern with those provisions and the early adoption of these types of policies,” stated Senator Kirk A. Cullimore on the March 7 floor session. Without the Bitcoin reserve clause, the bill only establishes basic custody protections for Utahns. It also provides the right to mine Bitcoin, run a node, develop software, and participate in staking without regulatory overreach. According to Bitcoin Laws , “This bill establishes a comprehensive framework for digital asset regulation and blockchain technology in Utah, providing clear definitions and protections for individuals and businesses engaging with digital assets. (…) It prohibits state and local governmental entities from restricting a person’s ability to accept digital assets as payment or use self-hosted or hardware wallets.” The bill is now headed to Utah Governor Spencer Cox’s desk to be signed into law after passing the Senate with a 19-7-3 vote. US Strategic BTC Reserve Race Continues Despite Utah’s Bitcoin Reserve outcome, other US states remain in the race to become the first state to establish an SBR. Bitcoin Laws data shows Arizona has two BTC reserve bills awaiting a final floor vote in the Senate. Similarly, the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve legislation, introduced in January, passed the Senate committee at the end of February and awaits its final vote. New Hampshire and Oklahoma have also advanced their proposals for an SBR at a state level. Meanwhile, bills from Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, and other states remain live but are at the early stages of the legislative process. It’s worth noting that US President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order to officially establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a “Digital Asset Stockpile.” Last Thursday, White House AI & Crypto Czar David Sacks announced that the reserve will be “capitalized with Bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings.” The executive order followed President Trump’s Mach 2 announcement of a “US Crypto Reserve” to elevate the industry “after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden Administration.”",Crypto News|bitcoin|Bitcoin reserve|btc|BTCUSDT|Crypto legislation|Donald Trump|HB230|Strategic Bitcoin Rerseve|US Bitcoin Reserve|US President|Utah strategic Bitcoin reserve,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|RUNE|FDUSD,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-03-11 02:30:18

Since hitting that level, the cryptocurrency has steadily declined, now trading below $80,000 as of today. While the short-term price action suggests a bearish outlook, some analysts remain confident about Bitcoin’s potential for long-term growth. Bitcoin’s Price Outlook: $180K Within Reach? One of CryptoQuant’s contributors to the QuickTake platform, ibrahimcosar, recently shared his perspective on Bitcoin’s price trajectory, offering a bold prediction for its next all-time high (ATH). In his latest analysis, the analyst reiterated his long-term expectation that Bitcoin could reach $180,000 by 2026, citing historical price cycles and institutional projections that align with his forecast. According to Ibrahim, Bitcoin’s price movements over the past year have followed a familiar pattern seen in previous bull cycles. The analyst pointed out that major financial institutions have recently begun making similar long-term projections, validating his earlier forecasts. While Bitcoin currently trades below $80,000, he believes that the asset has the potential to more than double in value within the next two years. If Bitcoin follows historical patterns, the $150K–$200K range could be achieved in the upcoming bull cycle. The analyst emphasized that investors who enter the market at current levels could see over 100% returns, provided Bitcoin reaches its predicted target by 2026. However, he also noted that timing the market correctly is crucial, as buying at key support levels has historically presented the most favorable opportunities for long-term gains. Ibrahim wrote: In summary, those investing in Bitcoin at these levels have the potential to gain over 100% in dollar terms without even waiting a year. Buying in the right regions and at the right times can present significant opportunities. Short-Term Market Trends and Buying Opportunities While long-term projections remain bullish, Bitcoin’s short-term price action continues to fluctuate. Another CryptoQuant analyst, BilalHuseynov, provided insights into open interest (OI) trends, which may indicate whether this is a favorable time to buy Bitcoin. According to BilalHuseynov, the 7-day change in open interest has entered a “deleveraging” phase, a signal that has historically aligned with potential buying opportunities. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Rally Above ATH To $128K – On-Chain Indicator Signals Potential Recovery The last time this occurred was in August 2024, when Bitcoin was trading between $58,000 and $60,000 before rallying to an all-time high of $106K. If historical trends repeat, the current market conditions could set the stage for a similar recovery. The CryptoQuant analyst noted: When the OI ratio’s change for 7 days down to the section, that means we can define the time to buy. Since August 2024, we have been observing one of the deepest areas in the Crypto Market. To remember, at this time (2024 Aug), Bitcoin’s price was around 58 – 60k.
