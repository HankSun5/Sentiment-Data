41448978,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=138856,1741644726,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Whale’s Strategic Rescue: Crypto Giant Averts Massive MakerDAO Liquidation with 2K ETH Deposit,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/whale-makerdao-liquidation-eth/,"In the fast-paced world of decentralized finance (DeFi), where fortunes can swing wildly in the blink of an eye, a recent on-chain event has captured the attention of crypto enthusiasts and market analysts alike. An anonymous crypto whale, facing a looming liquidation of a substantial 65,675 ETH on MakerDAO, executed a strategic rescue maneuver by depositing 2,000 ETH. This decisive action, worth millions, successfully restored the health ratio of their position and averted a potential market cascade. Let’s dive into the details of this fascinating event and understand its implications for the broader DeFi ecosystem. What Exactly Happened with the Crypto Whale and MakerDAO? Imagine navigating the turbulent waters of the crypto market, and suddenly, you find your vessel – in this case, a significant DeFi position – on the brink of capsizing. This was the situation faced by a crypto whale on MakerDAO , a leading decentralized lending platform. According to on-chain data, this particular whale was staring down the barrel of a potential liquidation of 65,675 ETH. To put that into perspective, at the time of the event, this amount was valued at a staggering $135.8 million. A liquidation of this magnitude could have sent ripples across the market, potentially triggering further liquidations and price volatility. Here’s a breakdown of the critical moments: The Threat: The whale’s position on MakerDAO was nearing the critical liquidation threshold. This meant that if the price of ETH, their collateral, were to fall further, MakerDAO’s smart contracts would automatically sell off their collateral to cover their debt. The Alert: On-chain monitoring tools, like those used by blockchain analytics firms, likely flagged this position as high-risk, triggering alerts within the crypto community. The Response: In a swift and calculated move, the whale withdrew 2,000 ETH from the Bitfinex exchange. The Rescue: Within just 20 minutes of the withdrawal, this 2,000 ETH was deposited directly into their MakerDAO vault. The Outcome: This injection of additional collateral successfully boosted the health ratio of their position to 1.07, effectively pulling it back from the brink of liquidation. [img src=”image-of-whale-depositing-eth-makerdao.jpg” alt=”Whale Deposits ETH to MakerDAO”] Why is Avoiding Liquidation So Crucial in DeFi? Liquidation events are an inherent mechanism in DeFi lending platforms like MakerDAO, designed to ensure the solvency of the system. However, they can also be incredibly painful for individual users and have broader market implications. Let’s understand why avoiding liquidation is paramount: For the Individual User: Liquidation means losing a significant portion of your collateral. When a position is liquidated, it’s not sold off at the optimal market price but rather at a discount to ensure a quick sale and cover the debt. This can result in substantial financial losses for the position holder. Systemic Risk: Large liquidations, especially of the magnitude faced by this whale, can introduce systemic risk into the DeFi ecosystem. A cascade of liquidations can lead to a rapid downward spiral in asset prices, impacting the entire market and potentially causing instability. Market Sentiment: Significant liquidation events can negatively impact market sentiment. They can create fear and uncertainty, leading to further sell-offs and hindering the overall growth and adoption of DeFi. MakerDAO and the Mechanics of Liquidation To fully appreciate the whale’s strategic rescue , it’s essential to understand how MakerDAO and its liquidation mechanism work. MakerDAO is a decentralized autonomous organization that issues DAI, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. Users can lock up collateral, such as ETH, in MakerDAO vaults to borrow DAI. The amount of DAI they can borrow is determined by the collateralization ratio, which is the value of the collateral relative to the borrowed DAI. This ratio is crucial for maintaining the health of the position. Here’s a simplified breakdown: Term Description Vault A smart contract where users deposit collateral and borrow DAI. Collateral Assets like ETH locked in the vault to secure the borrowed DAI. DAI The stablecoin borrowed against the collateral. Collateralization Ratio The ratio of collateral value to borrowed DAI value. A higher ratio indicates a healthier position. Liquidation Threshold A minimum collateralization ratio. If the ratio falls below this threshold, the vault is at risk of liquidation. Health Ratio A measure of the safety of a vault. A health ratio above 1 indicates the position is safe from immediate liquidation. When the value of the collateral (ETH in this case) decreases, or the value of DAI increases, the collateralization ratio falls. If it drops below the liquidation threshold, the MakerDAO protocol initiates liquidation. This is where the whale found themselves, and their prompt 2,000 ETH deposit was the antidote. The Significance of Whale Activity in the Crypto Market The actions of crypto whales, individuals or entities holding substantial amounts of cryptocurrency, often have a significant impact on the market. Their trades can trigger price movements, influence market sentiment, and sometimes even cause mini-crashes or rallies. This particular whale’s near-liquidation and subsequent rescue highlights several key aspects: Market Volatility: It underscores the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market, especially for assets like ETH. Even large holders are not immune to market fluctuations and the risks of liquidation. Importance of Risk Management: This event serves as a stark reminder of the critical importance of risk management in DeFi. Even sophisticated participants like whales need to actively monitor their positions and have strategies in place to mitigate risks. DeFi Infrastructure Resilience: The fact that the whale could successfully avert liquidation by depositing more collateral demonstrates the robustness of DeFi infrastructure. The transparent and permissionless nature of DeFi allows for quick and effective responses to market challenges. On-chain Transparency: The entire event, from the initial risk to the final rescue, was visible on the blockchain. This transparency is a hallmark of DeFi and allows for greater accountability and market understanding. Actionable Insights: Lessons from the Whale’s DeFi Maneuver What can we, as participants in the crypto space, learn from this whale’s experience? Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Your DeFi Positions Diligently: Whether you’re a whale or a smaller participant, regularly monitor the health ratios of your DeFi positions. Set up alerts for critical thresholds to avoid surprise liquidations. Understand Liquidation Risks: Before engaging in DeFi lending or borrowing, thoroughly understand the liquidation mechanisms of the platforms you use. Know the liquidation thresholds and how they are calculated. Diversify Your Collateral: Consider diversifying your collateral across different assets to reduce the risk associated with the price volatility of a single asset. Keep Dry Powder Ready: Maintain readily available funds (like stablecoins or easily accessible ETH) to quickly add collateral to your positions when needed, just as this whale did. Utilize Risk Management Tools: Explore and utilize DeFi risk management tools and dashboards that provide real-time monitoring and alerts for your positions across various platforms. The Future of DeFi and Risk Mitigation The DeFi space is constantly evolving, with new protocols, risk management tools, and strategies emerging regularly. Events like this whale’s near-liquidation experience contribute to the collective learning and refinement of the DeFi ecosystem. As DeFi matures, we can expect to see: More Sophisticated Risk Management Tools: Development of more advanced and user-friendly risk management tools will become crucial for wider DeFi adoption. Improved Liquidation Mechanisms: Protocols may explore more nuanced and less disruptive liquidation mechanisms to minimize market shocks. Increased User Education: Greater emphasis on user education about DeFi risks and best practices will empower participants to navigate the space more safely and effectively. Institutional Adoption: As institutions increasingly enter the DeFi space, their sophisticated risk management frameworks and resources could contribute to greater market stability. Conclusion: A Whale’s Wisdom in DeFi Waters The story of the crypto whale who averted a massive liquidation on MakerDAO is more than just a tale of high-stakes finance. It’s a compelling illustration of the risks and opportunities inherent in DeFi, the importance of strategic decision-making, and the ever-present need for vigilance in the volatile crypto market. This event serves as a valuable lesson for everyone involved in cryptocurrencies, from seasoned whales to newcomers dipping their toes into DeFi. By understanding the mechanics of platforms like MakerDAO, recognizing the signs of potential risk, and acting decisively, participants can navigate the DeFi waters more skillfully and safeguard their digital assets.

This will make the token available for trading on regulated exchanges. A Major Step for Thailand’s Crypto Framework It is worth noting that the security agency’s decision is part of updated digital asset regulations that will become operational by March 16, 2025. Reports say that these updated regulations intend to create a more flexible and structured environment for crypto businesses in Thailand. This will ensure a balance between innovation and investor protection. In February, it was reported that the agency requested the positions of industry leaders and experts on digital assets before finalizing the new framework. By approving USD₮, Thailand is taking a significant step toward integrating stablecoins into its financial system. The crypto adoption index shows that the nation is one of the most crypto-friendly jurisdictions. In fact, it is among the top 20 globally for adoption. Notably, USD₮ already accounts for around 40% of trading volumes in Thailand, with Tether’s stablecoin having a market cap of $142 billion. This new approval by the government further strengthens its role in bridging traditional finance and digital assets. Tether’s Commitment to Thailand While speaking on this development, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino, reaffirmed the company’s commitment to the Thai market. He stressed that Tether purpose is clear, to provide users with a secure, transparent, and reliable stablecoin experience. The company also intends to contribute to Thailand’s growing digital asset ecosystem by building a strong and sustainable infrastructure for stablecoins. Thailand’s forward-thinking stance on digital assets makes it a global model for crypto regulation. Unlike regions with uncertain policies, Thailand has taken proactive steps to create a structured and supportive environment for digital finance. Meanwhile, Thailand’s security agency announced plans to launch a trading system for digital tokens last month. Market Trends and Investor Confidence Despite this regulatory breakthrough, market dynamics will be crucial in adopting USD₮. As of this publication, Tether is trading at $1.00, and the trading volume is 113.46% active. In addition, this latest recognition of Tether (USDT), coincides with the firm hiring Simon McWilliams as the new Chief Financial Officer (CFO). The CEO disclosed that McWilliams’ strong background in financial audits was a key reason for his appointment. His appointment will help strengthen investor confidence in Tether’s stability and reliability.

However, ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood remains optimistic despite the price correction. Cathie Wood Shares Insight on Market Outlook According to her recent X post , Cathie Wood strongly believes that the market is seeing economic trends that could bring about a deflationary boom. The Ark Invest CEO has consistently championed a long-term, innovation-driven investment strategy in the past. This recent social media post further stresses her position. She postulated that the U.S. economy is nearing the end of a rolling recession, and Wood believes this process will trigger a major expansion. She also previously mentioned that innovation, particularly in sectors like AI, blockchain, and biotech, will significantly reshape global markets’ approach to digital assets and traditional investments. If her speculation clicks, she noted that the second half of this year could witness a rebound. This projection will be activated by more friendly monetary policies and rising institutional investment in cryptocurrency. Last month, Cathie Wood predicted that the BTC price will hit $1.5 million by 2030. However, the present market volatility suggests otherwise. Bitcoin and Altcoin Outlook Since the start of this year, the crypto market has experienced many intense crypto liquidations amid negative market sentiments. Bitcoin, for instance, is struggling to maintain key support levels. Market data shows that the coin has dropped below the $80,000 mark, down 3.18% in 24 hours. The second leading cryptocurrency, Ethereum, has also seen price fluctuations. The coin is currently trading at $1,852.09, having declined over 10% in the last 24 hours. Other altcoins, including Solana and XRP, have followed similar price declines. This has led to investor sell-offs and holding on to investments. Meanwhile, some analysts, like Cathie Wood, believe this pullback could be part of a healthy correction rather than a prolonged decline. Prospect for Market Rebound Several factors point to a potential market rebound, as experts see the market as oversold. The sustained inflow into spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs might be a catalyst to drive the market rebound. Meanwhile, the Trump administration’s latest introduction of a strategic Bitcoin reserve could lead to a major long-term market rebound. Similarly, institutional interest remains a key factor, with companies like Strategy doubling down on its Bitcoin agenda. Earlier today, CoinGape reported that MicroStrategy wants to raise $21 billion to expand its total Bitcoin holdings.

According to sources familiar with the matter, the order could include directives allowing crypto banks access to the Fed’s payment system and clarifying that stablecoins should not be classified as securities. The executive order is expected to explicitly roll back regulatory measures related to “Operation Chokepoint 2.0,” an alleged initiative under President Joe Biden that restricts banking services for cryptocurrency companies. The Trump administration views these restrictions as detrimental to the growth of the digital asset industry, sources familiar with the matter said. Bo Hines, executive director of the White House Presidential Task Force on Digital Assets, confirmed that an order was in development but declined to provide details. “I think the industry can expect something very soon,” Hines said. Related News: Bitwise Official Says “The Market Is Absolutely Wrong” About The Decline, Shares His Bullish Scenario One of the most significant impacts of Trump’s upcoming executive order could be a shift in the Fed’s stance on granting master accounts to crypto-focused banks. Master accounts provide direct access to the Fed’s payment system, a requirement for banks that serve customers nationwide. Under the Biden administration, the Fed has consistently denied master accounts to crypto-friendly banks like Custodia Bank, effectively preventing them from operating. If implemented, a policy change from the Fed that would grant access to the payment system could represent a major breakthrough for the digital asset industry. However, the Fed is an independent institution and its policies are not determined by the executive branch. According to the Fed’s official policy, its decisions “do not require the approval of the president or anyone in the executive or legislative branches of government.” This could present a legal challenge to any directive that attempts to force the central bank to take action. Senior White House officials are set to meet on Thursday to discuss potential legal challenges before finalizing the executive order, the sources said. The administration aims to ensure the directive withstands legal scrutiny before it reaches President Trump’s desk for his signature. The guidance is also expected to address stablecoins and reaffirm that they should not be classified as securities. If signed, this would be the third cryptocurrency-focused executive order President Trump has issued since taking office. *This is not investment advice.

This requires strong political will, resources, and ongoing commitment from both sides. Harmonizing Regulations: While collaboration is key, fully harmonizing regulations between two sovereign nations can be complex. Differences in legal systems and national priorities may present hurdles. Industry Adaptation: Cryptocurrency businesses operating in these regions will need to adapt to the evolving regulatory landscape. Clear communication and guidance from regulatory bodies will be crucial to ensure smooth transitions and compliance. Global Regulatory Landscape: The global AML and crypto regulation landscape is constantly evolving. El Salvador and Paraguay will need to stay agile and adapt their strategies to remain aligned with international best practices and standards. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? For individuals and businesses involved in cryptocurrency, here are some key takeaways and actionable insights: Increased Regulatory Scrutiny: Expect heightened scrutiny on cryptocurrency service providers operating in El Salvador and Paraguay. Unlicensed operations will likely face increased pressure. Emphasis on Compliance: Businesses should prioritize compliance with AML regulations and licensing requirements in both countries. This proactive approach will be essential for long-term sustainability. Opportunities for Legitimate Businesses: The push for clearer regulation and AML compliance can create a more level playing field, potentially benefiting legitimate and compliant cryptocurrency businesses.

In this category, Bybit was second only to Binance in trading volume before the February 21 hack, with an average of over 25% of the trading volume leading up to the incident. That has now dropped to 10.57% by March 9. Exchanges Market Share (Source: Kaiko) Interstingly, Bybit’s loss was Binance’s gain. The world’s largest exchange was the biggest beneficiary of the user exodus, as trading activity increased significantly after the Bybit hack. It was clear how Binance’s market share increased significantly. Before the hack, Binance was responsible for around 50% of the daily trading volume for centralized offshore exchanges. However, that changed significantly after the hack, with its market share average rising above 60%. Binance. The exchange accounted for 70.5% of the trading volume on February 23, 48 hours after the Bybit hack. Still, other exchanges also saw their market share increase after the incident, even if not at a similar rate to Binance’s. OKX and Coinbase’s share of the trading volume has been relatively higher since the incident. Bybit showing signs of recovery Meanwhile, Bybit’s current market share is a sign of a resurgence in trading activity, showing that some of its users are returning. In the days following the hack, the market share was in a free fall, leading to Bybit’s overall share hitting as low as 5.44% on March 2, just as its share of offshore exchange volume also reached its bottom at 6.42%. This highlights how the exchange’s crisis management enabled it to survive the biggest heist against a financial institution. By choosing not to pause withdrawals during the worst hours of the crisis and keeping users updated, the exchange was able to retain the trust of most in the crypto community. However, efforts to recover the funds have been quite slow. Despite multi-party efforts involving several security experts, only around 3% of the funds have been frozen so far. According to data from Bybit LazarusBounty page, only $43.71 million has been recovered so far. The exchange has also kept its word of giving out 10% of every recovered fund as a bounty. So far, it has paid out $4.32 million to several individuals and organizations that have helped freeze funds or provided information that led to the freezing. Despite this effort, the hackers have been able to convert at least $300 million of the stolen funds, according to data from Elliptic. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The winds of change might be blowing in Washington, D.C., and they could carry a seismic shift for the cryptocurrency industry. Whispers from industry insiders suggest that former President Donald Trump is poised to potentially sign an executive order this week that could dramatically alter the landscape of crypto banking rules in the United States. Could this be the game-changer the crypto world has been waiting for? Let’s dive deep into what this could mean for you, for crypto businesses, and for the future of digital finance. Will Trump’s Executive Order Really Overturn Anti-Crypto Banking Rules? According to a report by Decrypt, citing credible industry sources, the upcoming Trump executive order is expected to directly address and potentially dismantle the current administration’s perceived restrictive stance on crypto banking. The core aim? To pave the way for easier access to traditional banking services for cryptocurrency companies . This move could be a monumental leap forward for the industry, which has long grappled with regulatory hurdles and limited access to the conventional financial system. But what exactly are these ‘anti-crypto banking rules’ that are causing such a stir? Let’s break it down: Perceived Hostility: Many in the crypto industry feel that current regulations and interpretations have created an environment of uncertainty and even hostility towards digital asset businesses. This includes stricter compliance requirements and increased scrutiny from regulatory bodies. Banking Access Challenges: One of the most significant pain points for crypto companies is securing and maintaining relationships with banks. Many traditional financial institutions are hesitant to work with crypto businesses due to regulatory ambiguity, compliance costs, and perceived risks. Master Account Access: Access to master accounts at the Federal Reserve is crucial for payment system efficiency. Currently, very few crypto-focused institutions have been granted these accounts, hindering their ability to operate smoothly within the traditional financial system. If the reports are accurate, Trump’s executive order aims to directly address these challenges. The promise of overturning these perceived ‘anti-crypto’ policies has sent ripples of excitement throughout the crypto community, fueling speculation and hope for a more welcoming regulatory environment. Unpacking the Potential Impact: Access to Banks and the Federal Reserve The most tantalizing aspect of this potential executive order is the promise of facilitating banking access for cryptocurrency companies , specifically mentioning access to master accounts within the Federal Reserve ’s payment system. This is not just about opening checking accounts; it’s about integrating crypto businesses more deeply into the core financial infrastructure of the United States. Imagine a scenario where crypto exchanges, custodians, and payment processors can seamlessly access the same payment rails as traditional financial institutions. The benefits could be transformative: Reduced Operational Friction: Master accounts would streamline payment processing, reduce transaction costs, and enhance operational efficiency for crypto businesses. Increased Trust and Legitimacy: Access to the Fed’s payment system could lend greater legitimacy and trust to the crypto industry in the eyes of both consumers and traditional financial players. Level Playing Field: It could create a more level playing field between traditional financial institutions and emerging crypto companies, fostering innovation and competition. Boost for Innovation: With easier banking access, crypto companies can focus more on innovation and less on navigating complex regulatory hurdles and banking limitations.However, it’s crucial to temper expectations. While a presidential executive order carries significant weight, its practical implementation and long-term impact are not guaranteed. Several factors could influence the actual outcome. The Federal Reserve’s Independence: A Potential Hurdle? The report itself acknowledges a critical point: the Federal Reserve may not be directly influenced by the White House in terms of policy. The Fed is designed to be an independent central bank, insulated from direct political interference. This raises a key question: To what extent can a presidential executive order truly mandate the Fed to grant master accounts or alter its supervisory approach to cryptocurrency companies ? Here’s a balanced perspective: Potential Influence of the Executive Order Limitations Due to Fed Independence Setting Policy Direction: The EO can set a clear policy direction from the executive branch, signaling a desire for a more crypto-friendly banking environment. Directing Regulatory Agencies: The EO could direct other regulatory agencies, such as the Treasury Department or OCC, to take actions that indirectly influence the Fed. Public Pressure: A strong executive order can create public and political pressure on the Fed to reconsider its stance and approach. Operational Independence: The Fed retains operational independence in its decisions regarding master accounts and supervisory policies. Statutory Mandate: The Fed operates under a statutory mandate from Congress, and its actions are guided by its interpretation of those laws. Risk Management: The Fed’s primary concern is the safety and soundness of the financial system. It will likely prioritize risk management considerations when evaluating applications for master accounts, regardless of political pressure. Therefore, while a Trump executive order could be a significant catalyst for change, it’s unlikely to be a magic wand that instantly transforms the Fed’s approach. The Fed will likely continue to apply its rigorous due diligence and risk assessment processes when considering applications from cryptocurrency companies . Navigating the Path Forward: Actionable Insights for Crypto Businesses Regardless of the immediate outcome of this potential executive order, the very prospect of it signals a potential shift in the political winds. For cryptocurrency companies , this is a moment to be proactive and strategic. Here are some actionable insights: Prepare for Increased Scrutiny: Even with a more favorable policy environment, regulatory scrutiny is unlikely to disappear. Crypto businesses should continue to prioritize robust compliance programs and risk management frameworks. Engage with Policymakers: Actively engage with policymakers and regulators to educate them about the crypto industry and advocate for sensible regulations. Industry associations and lobbying efforts can play a crucial role. Strengthen Banking Relationships: Proactively build relationships with banks, even if access is currently limited. Demonstrate a commitment to compliance, transparency, and sound business practices to increase attractiveness as a banking client. Explore Alternative Banking Solutions: While pursuing traditional banking access, explore alternative banking solutions that cater to the crypto industry, such as specialized crypto-friendly banks or fintech platforms. Stay Informed and Adaptable: The regulatory landscape for crypto is constantly evolving. Stay informed about policy developments and be prepared to adapt your business strategies accordingly. Conclusion: A Hopeful Glimmer or a Transformative Dawn for Crypto Banking? The potential Trump executive order to overturn perceived anti- crypto banking rules represents a potentially monumental moment for the cryptocurrency industry. While the extent of its impact, particularly on the independent Federal Reserve , remains to be seen, the symbolic and directional shift could be significant. For cryptocurrency companies , this news offers a powerful glimmer of hope – a potential pathway towards greater integration with the traditional financial system, reduced operational friction, and a more level playing field for innovation. Whether this glimmer evolves into a transformative dawn for crypto banking depends on the specifics of the executive order, the Fed’s response, and the continued advocacy and resilience of the crypto industry itself. One thing is clear: the conversation around crypto and banking is far from over, and the next chapter promises to be intensely interesting.

The second stage of the presale has to raise only $2M to close, opening up the next stage of the project. World Liberty Financial has almost finalized the last stage of its WLFI token presale. A little over 40M tokens remain, with a price tag of $0.05, awaiting inflows of just $2M. The fundraising remained relatively slow, as most of the buying was for retail amounts. The fund is closing its second presale, after previously placing another 25B tokens at $0.015. For now, WLFI has not attracted other large-scale buyers, and most of the purchases are similar to small donations. WLFI continues to be sold most often for Ethereum (ETH) or USDC. WLFI purchases range from as low as $10 in USDC to 3.1ETH for one of the recent additions. The latest stage increased WLFI holders to 85,569 wallets. The fund’s next stage is to run its own version of an Aave vault, providing passive income based on crypto lending. The exact use case of the WLFI token will become clearer in the future, though the asset will remain locked and non-transferable for at least a year after the presale ends. World Liberty Fi portfolio loses $3M in a day World Liberty Fi is more than a fund and was used as an indicator for reliable token selection. Despite this, estimated losses from peak value may be up to $110M . It is hard to estimate the exact losses, since the fund has traded and reorganized its portfolio to retain value. The portfolio’s goal would be to ensure collaterals for an Aave vault, which would produce passive income. For that reason, World Liberty Fi has converted some of its assets into the most widely used collaterals on Aave. As of March 10, the fund’s portfolio based on the main public wallet fell to $75M in value, down $3M in a few hours. A rough estimate shows Ethereum (ETH) is the biggest source of losses, contributing up to 65% for the loss on paper. The fund bets on the Ethereum ecosystem, with ETH and its wrapped versions as the biggest holding. World Liberty Fi consolidated its holdings, with ETH still holding a prominent position. | Source: Arkham Intelligence Currently, the fund retains 7.53K ETH, valued at over $14M. This is the fund’s biggest holding, accrued in the past weeks from WLFI purchases and trading. The fund has been known to trade actively and buy the dip on ETH. Despite this, World Liberty Fi lost 9% of the ETH value in the past day, as the asset sank under $2,000. ETH makes up over 65% of the fund’s holdings, practically making the Trump family Ethereum maximalists. Even Eric Trump, one of the persons closest to the fund, has been taken to task for his recommendation to buy ETH, just before another significant price drawdown. Some of the assets of World Liberty Fi have been moved to other wallets, though one of the public addresses remains the most active, receiving inflows from buyers. World Liberty Fi retains its TRON (TRX) holdings, which have also posted the smallest losses. The fund also expanded its Movement (MOVE) holdings. Overall, World Liberty Fi decreased its token selection, removing some of its tokens from the main wallet. After recent token movements and shifts, the fund’s portfolio is more limited. World Liberty Fi has moved its Ondo (ONDO) and Chainlink (LINK) holdings while onboarding Whitebit (WHITE). Some of the funds were shifted to WBTC, serving both as a DeFi-compatible asset and a tracker of the BTC market price.

The company looks to address inefficiencies in the U.S. derivatives market, where trading has traditionally been limited to fixed hours and contracts with set expirations. Coinbase’s Futures Expansion Targets Institutional and Retail U.S. Traders According to Coinbase , crypto derivatives trading accounts for roughly 75% of global crypto volumes, yet a significant portion of these transactions have occurred outside the U.S. By launching perpetual-style futures contracts, Coinbase seeks to provide American traders access to the same international instruments while ensuring compliance with U.S. regulatory standards.

Coinbase has partnered with Nodal Clear to facilitate clearing services and ensure compliance with CFTC regulations. The exchange stated that introducing 24/7 futures trading is a step toward a more competitive U.S. derivatives market. The company also revealed plans to develop a new type of perpetual-style futures contract modeled after long-dated international offerings, designed to adhere to U.S. regulations. U.S. traders have historically been constrained by fixed trading hours, causing them to miss market movements occurring outside of regular sessions. With these changes, traders can manage risk and execute strategies in real time, eliminating a key limitation in the domestic market. Coinbase has been working with the CFTC and market participants to finalize the design of the new products. The company’s plans signal an effort to expand regulated crypto derivatives offerings in the U.S., where offshore platforms have traditionally held an advantage. Coinbase Expands U.S. Presence Amid CFTC’s Push for Digital Asset Innovation In February, Coinbase took a major step in the U.S. crypto derivatives market, introducing CFTC-approved futures contracts for Solana (SOL) and Hedera (HBAR). These contracts, structured for diverse trading strategies, add to Coinbase Derivatives’ growing portfolio, which now includes 19 futures contracts, such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and Dogecoin (DOGE).

Following the White House Crypto Summit, Armstrong expressed optimism about the industry’s growth potential under the current administration. While policy changes have sparked optimism, the ultimate direction of crypto regulation in the U.S. remains uncertain. How Coinbase’s move into perpetual futures influences the broader U.S. market—and whether regulatory clarity materializes—will be pivotal in shaping crypto’s domestic future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How might continuous futures trading reshape market dynamics? By enabling constant trading, nonstop futures boost liquidity and refine price discovery, yet may trigger swift price shifts if risk management systems fail to adapt to the faster pace. What regulatory hurdles could emerge from round-the-clock trading? Expanding trading hours require regulators to heighten oversight and adapt rules. Balancing market innovation with investor safeguards remains a challenge, as continuous trading complicates traditional risk monitoring. How could nonstop futures affect U.S. market competitiveness? Nonstop futures could strengthen the U.S. market standing by aligning domestic practices with global trends. This may foster better risk controls and encourage wider investor participation, enhancing overall market resilience.

The filing makes it the first ETF associated with the recently decentralized blockchain. Movement has announced that it is set to launch the beta version of the mainnet. In a prospectus filed on Monday, the fund will devote 80% of the net as MOVE tokens or related derivatives by channeling the fund into a REX-Osprey MOVE Subsidiary. The approval of the SEC requires an acknowledgment from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission before any action can be taken on it. Movement’s co-founder Rushi Manche highlighted that the ETF filing was an important step for the company. “Breaking the pattern of ETFs limited to long-established cryptocurrencies opens doors for institutional capital to support next-generation blockchain innovation,” Manche stated. Recent ETF applications for altcoins, including XRP, SOL, and HEDERA, reveal an increasing trend of seeking institutional investment and adopting digital assets. Rex Shares and Osprey Funds had also requested funds tracking assets, including BONK, DOGE, and TRUMP memecoin. Movement’s development and controversies Movement was built using the MoveOS programming language initially by Meta, a company that had planned to use it on Diem, its former stablecoin. Its implementation has also been criticized for not being transparent enough. The Movement Network Foundation officially released Movement Mainnet Beta on 30th November, but its deployment was delayed until 9th December. The network recently incorporated RPC service, and a core mainnet release is expected before the 10th of March. This ecosystem will launch the Cornucopia program to seed $250 million for the Movement Public Mainnet Beta. However, the team has faced much criticism over its political affiliations. Manche earlier defined politics as a major approach of crypto companies, other blockchain initiatives share the same opinion to inevitably adapt to the pro-crypto Trump administration. An unplanned Movement devnet launch in January raised some eyebrows after a DeFi startup, World Liberty Financial, connected to the Trump family, bought $2 million worth of MOVE tokens just a few minutes before reports emerged that indicated Movement was in talks with Musk about some integration to blockchain. Manche also dismissed accusations of insider trading. Under the leadership of the new commissioner, Acting Chair Mark T. Uyeda, the SEC is more friendly towards the crypto space. However, it has not authorized ETFs indexed to anything besides Bitcoin and Ethereum. The Movement ETF filing will go through the approval process before any action is made.

March Predictions Are In!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/what-will-solanas-future-be-march-forecasts-are-in/,"Solana (SOL) is facing a tough month with forecasters predicting further declines in its price throughout March. According to Polymarket data, the probability of Solana breaking above its all-time high of $300 this month has dropped to just 1% from 9% on March 2. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency has a 72% chance of falling to $110 from its current price of $118.94. Solana’s struggles come amid broader turmoil in the cryptocurrency market. SOL has lost nearly 60% of its value since President Donald Trump took office. The decline is not limited to Solana, as rival cryptocurrency XRP is also facing a similar downtrend. A number of factors contributed to this decline, including Trump’s volatile trade policies with China and allied countries, his pro-crypto stance falling short of industry expectations, and the $1.5 billion hack of the Bybit exchange. Related News: SEC Takes Action on Anti-Cryptocurrency Rule from Gary Gensler's Era, They're Changing It Solana’s reputation also took a hit in February when Argentine President Javier Milei introduced the Libra memecoin, which was launched on the Solana network. The token reached a market value of $4 billion before crashing 80% in an hour, costing investors $1.6 billion in losses. Adding to the uncertainty, Polymarket forecasters have lowered their expectations for Solana’s potential inclusion in the newly announced U.S. strategic crypto reserve. On March 2, when Trump unexpectedly announced the establishment of the reserve and suggested it could include Solana, the probability of SOL being included had reached 42%. However, those odds have since dropped to 23%. The probability of a Solana exchange-traded fund (ETF) being approved in 2025 also fell to 79% from 86% over the weekend, according to Polymarket, further dampening optimism. Several asset managers, including Franklin Templeton, have filed applications for a Solana ETF, some of which have been accepted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). *This is not investment advice.

While some of the old-school players like Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to dominate, many newer altcoins are now stepping up to the plate, offering massive opportunities for those brave enough to take the plunge. The challenge, though, is spotting the gems before they hit the mainstream. Take Cardano, for example—it’s one of those coins that people thought had all the potential in the world, yet it’s been slipping under the radar for too long. Big returns? It’s not looking likely anymore. On the flip side, Qubetics ($TICS) is a crypto that’s rising through the ranks fast, and it’s not just hype. The $TICS presale is already in its 25th stage, and experts are predicting jaw-dropping gains in the near future. For anyone looking to snag one of the top cryptos for significant returns in 2025, don’t let this one pass by. Sure, Cardano had its time in the sun, but there are new contenders offering even greater potential for those who know where to look. When thinking about top cryptos for significant returns, it’s crucial to identify projects that go beyond just being another “altcoin.” These are the projects that address real-world problems, making them the go-to solutions for industries and individuals alike. Qubetics is one such project that stands out, especially with its game-changing application, QubeQode IDE, which has real-world use cases that many existing cryptos can’t match. In short, while Cardano’s time may be behind it, Qubetics is where the future lies. Cardano Coin: A Missed Opportunity for Big Returns? If you’ve been following the crypto space for a while, you probably remember when Cardano was all the rage. It’s a coin that had its time in the spotlight and a loyal following, but today, it feels like Cardano’s ship has sailed. The hype around it was real in the early stages. The promise of scalability, a strong academic backing, and a robust development ecosystem had people believing Cardano could be the next big thing. Fast forward a few years, and things just didn’t pan out the way people hoped. One of the major reasons Cardano didn’t live up to expectations is the fact that it’s been slow to roll out key features. While other cryptos have been iterating fast, Cardano has often been criticized for taking its sweet time, which means it’s not always as competitive as it needs to be. Additionally, the market has moved on, and with so many new projects emerging, Cardano just doesn’t seem to have that same “wow” factor it once did. Cardano was supposed to be the “Ethereum killer,” but it’s been hard to find that killer instinct. Looking at Cardano’s current market position, it’s clear that significant returns aren’t going to come easy for anyone still holding the coin. Sure, there may still be some occasional spikes, but for anyone thinking about getting into Cardano now, it’s tough to imagine the kind of explosive gains that were once predicted. By the time the ship finally comes in, those hoping for top cryptos for significant returns in 2025 might have missed out. It’s a classic example of how waiting too long on a project can result in missed opportunities. Qubetics: A Real Opportunity in 2025 for Top Cryptos for Significant Returns Now, let’s talk about Qubetics. It’s not just another flashy cryptocurrency with a bold name and promises of moonshots. This is a project that actually delivers—one that is actively addressing real-world problems and has all the makings of a massive hit in 2025 and beyond. The $TICS presale is in its 25th stage right now, and it’s been selling fast. So far, over 498 million tokens have been sold to more than 22,700 holders, raising over $14.9 million. But the real story here is what Qubetics is doing with its technology—specifically the QubeQode IDE. QubeQode IDE is a game-changer. Imagine a tool that allows businesses, software developers, and individuals to build and deploy decentralized applications (dApps) with ease. For someone who’s been stuck using clunky, outdated software for years, QubeQode is a breath of fresh air. It streamlines the development process, removes unnecessary barriers, and puts power back in the hands of those who need it most. For developers, QubeQode is a platform where they can create apps without the usual bottlenecks, cutting down on time spent on coding, testing, and debugging. Let’s break this down with real-life scenarios. Think about a small business owner who’s tired of relying on centralized platforms for all their transactions. With Qubetics, they can easily build and implement blockchain-based solutions that can save time and reduce costs. Maybe you’re a developer who wants to build a decentralized social media platform. Using QubeQode, you’d be able to quickly put together a secure, scalable application without the usual headaches. The possibilities are endless. And here’s the kicker: Analysts are predicting some serious gains for $TICS once the presale ends. Right now, $TICS is priced at just $0.1074, but by the end of the crypto presale , it could be worth $0.25, representing a 132% return on investment. After the presale? Experts are talking about $TICS reaching $1, $5, and even $15—imagine an ROI of 830% or more. If $TICS hits $15, that’s an astronomical 13,859% return. Analysts believe that $TICS could hit the $10-$15 mark after the mainnet launch. If you’re still sitting on the sidelines, now is the time to get in before this ship sails too. Why Qubetics Stands Out as One of the Top Cryptos for Significant Returns The beauty of Qubetics lies in its unique approach to solving real-life problems. Unlike many cryptocurrencies that focus solely on being a store of value or currency, Qubetics is about building real-world applications with lasting impact. Whether you’re a tech professional, a business owner, or even someone just trying to make their daily life a bit easier, Qubetics offers something that actually works. It’s one of the few projects in the crypto space where the underlying technology has real utility. And as the crypto market grows, the demand for innovative solutions like Qubetics is only going to increase. With the Qubetics presale ongoing and analysts predicting significant price growth in 2025, now is the perfect time to get involved with one of the top cryptos for significant returns. The combination of strong utility, real-world applications, and high growth potential makes Qubetics a no-brainer for anyone looking to capitalize on the future of blockchain technology. Conclusion The market is full of opportunities for those who know where to look. Cardano, once touted as a leader in the space, now feels like a missed opportunity. Meanwhile, Qubetics is poised for huge success, with its unique technology and presale momentum indicating significant price growth in the near future. As more people realize the potential of $TICS, it’s only a matter of time before it breaks out in a big way. So, if you’re looking for top cryptos for significant returns in 2025, don’t sleep on Qubetics. The time to act is now.

Park had been released on bail pending allegations of orchestrating an alleged $60 million crypto scam that centers on a token named Podo Coin. Scam Coin Allegations: Fresh Arrest Warrant for Market Maker The newspaper Seoul Kyungjae reported that the newly formalized Joint Investigation Unit for Virtual Asset Crimes (JIU) , part of the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors’ Office, has now been charged with a separate offence. Cars seized from ‘scam coin’ suspect and crypto market maker Jon Bur Kim in prosecution raids. (Source: Maeil Kyungjae/Screenshot) Prosecutors think that Park helped list and issue an alleged “scam coin” named Artube (ATT). They think that Park and his associates use the token to dupe investors out of a total of 260 billion won ($179.6 million). Notable crypto exchanges , including South Korea’s Coinone, have previously listed ATT. But ATT trading volumes and coin value have plummeted in more recent times. Trading volumes on the South Korean crypto exchange Coinone over the past 12 months. (Source: CoinGecko) Following its listing, ATT prices initially surged. However, prices began to fall soon after. In early February last year, Coinone designated ATT as a coin of concern, citing the following reasons: suspension of official community activities inactivity of major businesses and services failure to inform investors about major short-term and mid- to long-term business plans failure to disclose related information in a timely manner Coinone, EconomyBloc reported last year, contacted the “project team” for answers, but was unsatisfied with the developers’ response. On February 20, Coinone wrote that it had decided to “end trading support for ATT to protect investors.” Transaction support was ended in early March, with withdrawal support following a month later.

Dogecoin Is Currently Testing The Lower Bound Of An Ascending Channel In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed about a long-term pattern forming in the weekly price of Dogecoin. The pattern in question is the “Ascending Channel” from technical analysis (TA), which is a type of Parallel Channel. A Parallel Channel is a consolidation pattern in which the price of the asset remains locked between two parallel trendlines. The upper level of the channel is likely to provide resistance, while the lower one can be a point of support. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Signal Aligns With Price Tops, CryptoQuant Analyst Reveals Breaks out of either of these lines can imply a continuation of trend in that direction. That is, an escape above the channel is bullish, while a drop under it is bearish. Parallel Channels can be categorized into three types, based on the alignment of the trendlines with respect to the coordinate axes. Channels that are slopped upwards (that is, those that have trendlines that follow higher lows and higher highs) are known as Ascending Channels. While an asset is inside this type of channel, its price witnesses consolidation to the net upside Similarly, those of the opposite orientation are called Descending Channels and represent consolidation to the net downside. The third case, where the trendlines are parallel to the time-axis, has no special name. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst, that shows an Ascending Channel that the weekly price of Dogecoin has been trading inside for the past decade: As is visible above, the 1-week Dogecoin price has witnessed a sharp decline recently and is nearing in on the lower level of the channel situated at $0.16. The last time that the memecoin retested the line was during the last few months of 2024 and it successfully found support back then. “All eyes on Dogecoin $DOGE! If it holds this level at $0.16 and bounces, a move to $2 could be next!” notes the analyst. This $2 target is roughly around where the asset would meet the middle line of the channel, a level that has also shown interactions with its price in the past. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Signal: $900 Million In BTC Leaves Exchanges It only remains to be seen, though, whether the memecoin will indeed find support and the Ascending Channel will continue to hold. There is always the chance of a breakdown with patterns like these, which, as mentioned earlier, can lead to bearish price action. DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is floating around $0.176, down more than 20% over the last seven days.

The addition is a nod to the company’s healthy fiscal outlook, giving it some leeway to outdo mining-specific challenges that may arise, especially following a halving that happened in April 2024. While most industry participants are fighting for their lives, CleanSpark has overcome those odds and become one of the most successful public Bitcoin miners of 2025. CleanSpark performance has been consistent throughout the period CleanSpark chief executive officer and president, Zack Bradford, has been enjoying the success of a stronger business model, which has led to CleanSpark’s addition to the S&P SmallCap 600 Index. The addition creates value, a cascade opportunity, and a more diversified investment, but it also creates, as he puts it, “vertical integration” in Bitcoin mining. CleanSpark’s profits surged to $241.7 million, or $0.85 per share, in the final quarter of 2024, up from just $25.9 million a year earlier. This represents an 833% rise YoY. Company-wide revenues jumped 120% on a year-over-year basis to $162.3 million. As of February 2025, CleanSpark’s BTC holdings rose 6% to 11,177 BTC, positioning it as one of the top five public BTC mining and holding companies. The Bitcoin mining business has been struggling since halving in April 2024. This placed other players in the mining industry in a weaker economic position and caused them to look for alternate sources of revenue. AI data centre build-outs are also taking a market share that rightly deserves to be taken away from the old-school Bitcoin mining business, which is far more profitable. CleanSpark has succeeded when everyone else is feeling pressed Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in the parts of the economy that are now severely bottlenecked remain one surefire way to stifle competition early. However, the biggest moves in the industry have already occurred. According to JPMorgan, Riot Platforms and CleanSpark, which have aggressively expanded their holdings, have fortified their positions competitively. As many Bitcoin miners navigate shifts within the industry, CleanSpark has a more bullish outlook. The April 2024 Bitcoin halving event that reduced block reward and miner revenues forced many companies to revise their strategies. Consequently, a few mining companies turned to AI data centers, which have been considerably more profitable. This transition remains largely under the general public’s radar, as Nvidia GPUs dedicated to AI model training operate at vastly greater scales than those used for Bitcoin mining. With this evolution comes a wave of M&A in the industry as smaller firms struggle to survive. JPMorgan also points out that CleanSpark and Riot Platforms have aggressively pursued acquisitions to increase their market share. In contrast, capital-constrained miners such as IREN and Cipher have pursued a more disciplined path, searching for alternative forms of revenue with lower capital needs.

The Meteoric Rise of Official TRUMP Coin Launched on January 17, 2025, just days before President Donald Trump’s inauguration, the Official TRUMP Coin ($TRUMP) took the crypto world by storm. Hosted on the Solana blockchain, $TRUMP debuted with an initial coin offering (ICO) of 200 million tokens, priced between $7 and $8 each. Within 24 hours, the coin’s value skyrocketed over 300%, reaching a market capitalization exceeding $14 billion. The coin’s distribution was notably centralized, with 80% of the total supply retained by Trump-affiliated entities, CIC Digital LLC and Fight Fight Fight LLC, to be released gradually over three years. This concentration raised eyebrows among investors and ethics experts, sparking debates about potential conflicts of interest and market manipulation. Despite these concerns, early investors who seized the opportunity during the ICO reaped substantial rewards. The coin peaked at $74.59 before stabilizing around $52, offering significant returns for those who entered early. However, as with many meme coins, $TRUMP’s price experienced volatility, emphasizing the importance of timing in such investments. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, Arctic Pablo Coin emerges as a compelling opportunity for those seeking exponential returns in the meme coin space. Its unique presale structure, attractive staking rewards, and deflationary mechanisms make it a standout choice among the top new meme coins for exponential returns.

Expert Weighs In,https://cryptopotato.com/is-bitcoin-immune-to-stock-market-volatility-expert-weighs-in/,"Bitcoin, the number one cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is facing market turbulence, but prominent trader CrediBULL Crypto remains unfazed. He argues that BTC’s correlation with traditional stocks is overstated, and maintains that the asset’s long-term trajectory remains intact. Bitcoin’s Correlation With Stocks: Overblown Fears? The recent dip in the price of Bitcoin, where it dropped below $80,000, has sparked debate over its ties to traditional financial markets. Some analysts fear the weaknesses witnessed in equities could spill over into crypto. However, CrediBULL Crypto is of the opinion that the S&P 500’s correction is a normal market movement rather than a sign of deeper trouble. “The correction we have seen thus far on it, for all intents and purposes, is considered healthy/normal based on my system,” the trader wrote on X. He highlighted that historically, BTC has moved independently, even during times of macroeconomic uncertainty. While mainstream finance experts see risk, CrediBULL views the current dip as an opportunity for patient investors. “Charts that look ‘cooked’ present the most lucrative opportunities,” he asserted , dismissing concerns about looming economic slowdowns. The investor, with more than 465,000 followers on X, advised traders to focus on Bitcoin’s technical levels rather than stock market trends. According to him, the original cryptocurrency is forming a base between key resistance and support zones, leading him to believe that holding current levels would be a bullish indicator. However, market analysts such as Peter Brandt and BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, have pointed to a potential drop below $80,000 for BTC. Brandt has noted a double-top pattern, warning that the cryptocurrency needs to reclaim $90,000 to reverse bearish sentiment. On his part, Hayes sees a potential retest of $78,000, with $75,000 as the next downside target if the asset’s weakness persists. Market Sentiment While the coin is still up 18.6% across 12 months, its current price is 25% lower than its all-time high level of $108,786 recorded earlier in the year. Despite the pullback, long-term sentiment has improved. Even though the Fear and Greed Index shifted from 92 a year ago, signaling “extreme greed,” to a recent low of 10 , indicating “extreme fear,” the price of Bitcoin is still nearly 20% higher than it was then. For now, investors are urged to stay patient and have a strategy for both bearish and bullish turns. “Key is to have a plan for either outcome so you literally can’t lose,” is CrediBULL’s advice.

Every time everyone shouts that this time is different.” According to Barhydt, the current pullback mirrors market movements from 2017, when increased fiat liquidity led to significant asset price gains. He suggests that underlying macroeconomic conditions remain largely the same, suggesting that Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory is still on track. Related News: SEC Takes Action on Anti-Cryptocurrency Rule from Gary Gensler's Era, They're Changing It Barhydt outlined several key economic factors that he believes will drive future liquidity in financial markets, including Bitcoin: Lower Treasury yields to refinance debt. Lower mortgage rates to unlock residential and commercial real estate markets. Lower Treasury yields to support struggling banks. He also pointed to China’s economic struggles, saying the country is in a deep recession and is likely to benefit from lower U.S. interest rates, which could allow for more monetary easing. Barhydt predicts significant job losses in the coming months in the government, technology and housing sectors. However, he expects the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) index to rise during this period, suggesting continued economic activity. “All of this tells us that liquidity will continue to flow and markets will do what they always do in these types of cycles,” he explained, adding: “That liquidity will flow into stocks, into Bitcoin, into crypto, into real estate.” While Bitcoin’s sudden drop has alarmed many, Barhydt remains optimistic, arguing that the current downturn is a temporary pullback in a larger liquidity-driven growth cycle. “One more time… fasten your seat belts,” he said. *This is not investment advice.

Crypto trader Ali Martinez tells his 131,400 followers on the social media platform X that the top five dollar-pegged crypto assets by market cap have a total valuation of $204.7 billion. The five largest stablecoins in the market include Tether’s USDT , Circle’s USDC , USDS , Ethena’s USDe and DAI , according to data from CoinGecko . Source: Ali Martinez/X A soaring stablecoin market cap suggests more buying power on the sidelines. It may also suggest that investors are unloading their crypto assets in favor of dollar-pegged coins. Looking at Ethena ( ENA ), a decentralized protocol designed to provide a crypto-based alternative to the traditional banking system, Martinez says the altcoin is flashing a bullish signal based on the Tom DeMark Sequential indicator. Traders use the TD Sequential Indicator to predict potential trend reversals for tokens based on the closing prices of their 13 previous bars or candles. “Ethena ENA is flashing bullish signals! A buy signal from the TD Sequential indicator on the weekly chart, combined with a hammer candlestick at key support, suggests a strong rebound could be ahead.” Source: Ali Martinez/X A hammer candlestick pattern is typically viewed as a bullish reversal signal with the candle wick indicating demand. At time of writing, ENA is trading for $0.44. The trader adds that the decentralized oracle network Chainlink ( LINK ) and the modular blockchain Celestia ( TIA ) are also showing signs of a potential rebound based on the TD Sequential indicator. At time of writing, LINK is worth $14.30 and TIA is trading for $3.11.

His earlier stance indicates a preference for measured, conventional monetary policies. Renewed focus on his views hints at possible shifts in Canada’s economic and regulatory strategies. Canada’s Prime Minister-designate, Mark Carney, previously expressed skepticism over Bitcoin’s viability, notably calling cryptocurrencies indicative of financial bubbles and limited in utility during a 2018 speech. Incoming Canadian PM Mark Carney On BTC Carney, who headed the Bank of England from 2013 to 2020, questioned Bitcoin’s viability at the Scottish Economics Conference at Edinburgh University in 2018 in a speech titled “The Future of Money.” https://twitter.com/liberal_party/status/1898864551551959478 Carney argued that cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin inherently possess serious economic deficiencies due to their fixed supply rules. “Far from being strengths, the fixed supply rules of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are serious deficiencies,” Carney said. “Fundamentally, they would impart a deflationary bias on the economy if such currencies were to be widely adopted.” Additionally, the former Bank of Canada head highlighted that prices of digital assets at the time exhibited “classic hallmarks of bubbles,” including increased retail enthusiasm, new paradigm justifications, and extrapolative price predictions. “The long, charitable answer is that cryptocurrencies act as money, at best, only for some people and to a limited extent, and even then only in parallel with the traditional currencies of the users,” he continued. “The short answer is they are failing.” Canada-U.S. Trade War Continues Carney’s comments resurfaced shortly after he won Canada’s federal election, replacing outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who announced his resignation two months ago. U.S. President Donald Trump has frequently dangled the carrot of costly tariffs against both Canada and Mexico in recent weeks in a bid to curb his concerns over alleged drug trafficking and inadequate border control measures connected to the two countries. Observers argue that the tariffs in question could be counterproductive to U.S. economic interests, with stocks dropping on Monday amid growing recession fears. https://twitter.com/FOX9/status/1899217731788132684 In his victory speech on Monday, Carney vowed to win the ongoing trade war with the U.S. , while President Trump has yet to respond. As Mark Carney prepares to take office, Canadians and global markets alike will closely monitor how his past skepticism towards cryptocurrencies influences his economic policies. Equally notable is how Carney navigates the delicate relationship with the United States amid escalating tariff tensions. Ultimately, his ability to manage these interconnected economic and diplomatic challenges may define both his tenure as Prime Minister and Canada’s financial landscape for years to come. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How might Carney’s historical stance on Bitcoin shape Canada’s digital currency regulation? Carney’s longstanding Bitcoin skepticism indicates he may endorse tighter crypto regulations. His policy focus appears aimed at protecting market stability and mitigating speculative risks in Canada’s financial system. What could be the broader economic effects if Carney implements stricter crypto oversight? Stricter crypto oversight may bolster Canada’s financial stability by curbing market volatility and excessive speculation, but could also temper the rapid growth of digital finance within an evolving global economy. How does global economic uncertainty impact Carney’s regulatory approach to digital finance? Facing global economic uncertainty, Carney advocates a cautious regulatory approach that limits exposure to volatile digital assets while upholding traditional financial safeguards amid market shifts.

We get attacked every day, but this was done with a lot of resources. Either a large, coordinated group and/or a country is involved. Tracing …” he wrote on X . In March 2023, the platform also experienced over an hour of glitches, as links stopped working, some users were unable to log in, and images did not load for others. Elon Musk faces cyberattacks, falling Tesla sales, and targeted vandalism Over the last few days, Elon Musk has been tackling a slew of problems across his businesses, X, Tesla, and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). He is growing increasingly suspicious that these are actually all part of a coordinated attack on his companies. Elon Musk explained the outages in terms of a “massive cyberattack” that, he said, took a lot of resources to carry out, perhaps implicating a large coordinated group or a state actor. He said the attack originated from IP addresses in the Ukraine region but did not offer evidence to support that assertion. At the same time, Tesla has been facing plummeting sales and public blowback. Recently, the company reported a 15% decrease in stock value. Tesla stores have also been the targets of vandalism and protests. For example, an AR-15-style rifle was used to attack a Tesla showroom in Salem, Oregon, in February, while four Tesla Cybertrucks in Seattle were set on fire. In an interview with Fox’s Larry Kudlow on Monday, billionaire Elon Musk admitted that his involvement with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Donald Trump’s initiative to reduce federal spending, is making it tougher to run his many businesses: X, Tesla, xAI, SpaceX, The Boring Company, and Starlink. #Teslatakedown protests escalate as Musk suggests coordinated attack Meanwhile, the incidents come on the heels of the #Teslatakedown movement that protests Musk’s role in the Trump administration as well as his management of DOGE. Demonstrators have staged sit-ins outside Tesla showrooms across the country, calling on consumers to stop buying Tesla products and divest from the company. While the convergence of events has spurred theories of a coordinated opposition to Musk’s endeavors, Musk himself chimed in affirmatively to a user that recent accusations, including protests against DOGE, attacks on Tesla stores, and the cyberattack on X, might all be connected. Details are still developing, but so far, there has been little evidence to link the incidents. Experts have warned against jumping to conclusions without thorough investigations. Nicholas Reese, an adjunct professor at New York University’s Center for Global Affairs, said a state conducting such a cyberattack was not likely, and the outages were relatively short-lived. He said technical data from X should support such claims. Elon Musk’s businesses are grappling with a wave of scrutiny, from hackers and public protesters to falling stock prices. Although Musk believes there’s an organized effort behind these occurrences, concrete proof has not materialized. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) said in a March 10 statement that it received 2,668 complaints in 2024 and found seven types of scams they didn’t have on record yet, such as fake Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining schemes, where fraudsters offer fake investments in mining. The DFPI also received complaints about fake crypto gaming schemes, where users are encouraged to deposit funds only to have their wallets drained , and fraudsters offering fake jobs that require victims to transfer crypto and provide private information. Source: California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation Victims also reported the theft of private keys through fake airdrops, fake investment group scams in WhatsApp or Telegram, AI Investment scams offering unusually high returns and losing their crypto after interacting with certain sham websites. The AI industry experienced significant growth in 2024 , reaching a market cap of $638 billion, according to Precedence Research. There was also a notable rise in crimeware-as-a-service (CaaS), where experienced hackers and cybercriminals sell their tools and services to less experienced offenders for a price. DFPI Commissioner KC Mohseni said the regulator is urging caution when interacting with unknown platforms and to “verify website domains to avoid fraudulent imitations, and stay wary of crypto recovery scam sites.” Through its partnership with the State, the DFPI says it shut down more than 26 fraudulent crypto websites and uncovered $4.6 million in user losses last year. California DOJ shuts down 42 crypto scam websites California’s Department of Justice (DOJ) took down 42 crypto scam websites in 2024 that stole $6.5 million from victims, with an average loss per person of $146,306. In a March 10 statement , the California DOJ said that because international fraudsters often carry out scams, they are difficult to prosecute and arrest. Common threads among the scam websites were promises of high returns, no contact information, offers of prizes for signing up, and no listings on legitimate crypto industry websites such as CoinMarketCap, the California DOJ said.

The stock, which trades under MicroStrategy, lost 17% on Monday, sinking to $239.27—a devastating drop from its $473.83 peak in November, according to data from Google Finance. The company has now lost nearly 50% of its value as economic uncertainty, Trump’s policies, and Bitcoin’s own struggles slam the crypto-focused firm. Saylor turned Strategy into a Bitcoin-heavy holding company, a decision that once excited investors looking for exposure to the crypto without directly buying it. The company’s plan to raise $42 billion through debt and stock sales to fund more Bitcoin purchases only added to the frenzy. But now, with the market turning sour, that approach is looking a lot riskier. Bitcoin’s drop and Trump’s policies are dragging Strategy down The sharp decline in Strategy’s stock comes as Bitcoin itself is losing momentum. The OG crypto fell by 4% on Monday, trading around $80,000, after the Trump administration confirmed that the planned Bitcoin reserve would not involve new purchases. Instead, the government will only use the tokens it already owns, allowing only budget-neutral strategies for acquiring more. That announcement killed the speculation that had been fueling Strategy’s rally. Investors had hoped that Trump’s return to office would mean massive government Bitcoin purchases, potentially boosting prices. Instead, they’re getting nothing. “There’s specifics to the crypto trade, and then there’s the overall risk trade, neither of which is particularly helpful for Bitcoin,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. He added that Strategy, as a highly leveraged Bitcoin proxy, is now in even deeper trouble. Trade wars, mass firings, and market chaos are piling on But it’s not just crypto. The entire market is under pressure, and Trump’s trade war is making things worse. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 900 points Monday, while the Nasdaq recorded its worst day since 2022 and the S&P 500 dropped 2.7%. The uncertainty started when Trump reimposed 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada, after briefly pausing them. That policy whiplash has spooked investors, adding to the broader fears about the economy. Meanwhile, inside the government, Elon Musk, a key Trump adviser, is leading an effort to fire thousands of federal employees. That shake-up is only adding to the instability. Markets that once cheered Trump’s economic approach are now backtracking, as investors see more unpredictability ahead. Trump, who once used stock market performance as a bragging point, has suddenly stopped talking about it. Instead, the White House is spinning a different story—that business leaders are still optimistic. “We’re seeing a strong divergence between the animal spirits of the stock market and what’s actually unfolding in business,” said a White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity, per a report from CNBC. Jim Cramer tells investors to not be scared over Monday’s stock selloff Some investors are no longer waiting around to see what happens. Wall Street is now bracing for a recession, and CNBC’s Jim Cramer says the market is terrified by Trump’s policy shifts. “Of course, not many investors saw this coming—and that’s incredible to me,” Jim said Monday. “Virtually overnight, they’ve decided that we’re headed for a recession, and it’s going to happen fast.” He compared the situation to Herbert Hoover, the president who worsened the Great Depression by raising tariffs. And he pointed to a new threat that’s freaking out tech investors: China’s DeepSeek, a startup that may have found a way to run AI technology cheaper and more efficiently than the current leaders. Tech stocks, which had been driving market gains, are now in retreat. Investors who rushed to buy “recession-proof” stocks on Monday ended up overpaying, according to Jim. Others got burned on panic-selling. Some traders, he said, “were ripped off on their buys”, as they scrambled to move money into safer investments. He warned against buying into the hype of recession-proof stocks too early and advised investors to focus on low-multiple techs, industrials, and banks. As for big tech giants, the so-called “Magnificent Seven”, Jimmy declared that the group “no longer exists” in the way it once did. That’s a major change in market sentiment and another sign that investors are rethinking everything. Jim also told investors to not let Monday’s sell-off “scare you out of the market entirely.” For now, Strategy’s fate remains directly linked to Bitcoin’s performance. If the crypto market continues to weaken, Saylor’s plan to fund future purchases with debt and stock sales could become a major liability. Investors aren’t willing to bet on Bitcoin at these levels, and that’s leaving Strategy in a vulnerable position. Right now, nobody is stepping in to save it.

Officials in the European Union (EU) are warning that Washington’s growing embrace of Bitcoin and dollar-backed stablecoins could seriously threaten Europe’s financial sovereignty. Pierre Gramegna, managing director of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), said Monday in Brussels that the U.S. stance on crypto raises concerns, especially as the European Central Bank (ECB) is still undecided on launching a digital euro. “The US administration is favorable toward cryptocurrencies and especially dollar-denominated stablecoins, which may raise certain concerns in Europe,” Gramegna told reporters. He warned that Trump’s push for crypto-backed financial tools could allow American and foreign tech giants to roll out mass payment systems based on stablecoins, potentially undermining the euro’s dominance. Trump moves forward with Bitcoin reserve Trump is not waiting for approval from anyone. Last week, he signed an executive order setting up a Bitcoin reserve and a second storage system for crypto assets seized through legal cases. The decision locks crypto into the U.S. government’s financial system, a major shift from past policies where officials treated it with suspicion. While the U.S. doubles down on crypto, Europe remains hesitant. The ECB has been developing a digital euro since 2021, but its final decision is still months away. Unlike the U.S., the ECB has refused to consider Bitcoin for its monetary reserves. Now, with Trump’s latest move, European leaders say they need to accelerate their work to prevent financial instability in the region. “The digital euro is today more necessary than ever,” Gramegna said, backing the ECB’s urgency. The ESM believes the EU must launch the digital euro soon to protect its monetary autonomy. Not everyone in Europe agrees on how to handle crypto. Christine Lagarde, president of the ECB, made it clear in January that Bitcoin will never be part of the EU’s official reserves. “I’m confident that Bitcoins will not enter the reserves of any of the central banks of the General Council,” Lagarde said. She was responding to statements from Ales Michl, governor of the Czech National Bank (CNB), who said his institution might explore Bitcoin investments in December 2024. The Czech Republic is part of the EU but doesn’t use the euro. Still, Michl’s comments caused enough of a stir that Lagarde had to address them. She emphasized that ECB policymakers agree on keeping reserves liquid, secure, and free from risks like money laundering. “I had a good conversation with my colleague from the Czech Republic and I leave it to him to make whatever announcement he wants to make,” Lagarde said. But she insisted that the ECB will not accept Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Czech National Bank considered crypto for a second Michl confirmed in an interview with the Financial Times in December that the bank is looking into the possibility of adding Bitcoin to its reserves, with a potential allocation of 5%. He later clarified on X that discussions were still in the early stages. On January 28, the Czech finance minister expressed concerns about the idea, whilst hinting a bit at division within the country’s leadership. Meanwhile, the CNB’s seven-member policy board approved a plan to analyze new investment options, though they didn’t directly mention crypto. “At the proposal of Governor Ales Michl, the CNB is to assess whether it would be appropriate in terms of diversification and return to include other asset classes,” the board said in a statement. No final decision has been made, and changes won’t happen until the analysis is complete. Not everyone is convinced that Bitcoin belongs in national reserves. Last month, Christian Lindner, former German finance minister, floated the idea of using Bitcoin as a reserve asset, but the reaction was mostly negative. Joachim Nagel, president of Germany’s Bundesbank, literally Bitcoin to the tulip mania that crashed the Dutch economy in the 1600s. “Reserve assets must be secure, liquid, and transparent,” Nagel said. “Bitcoin is none of these things.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Market analysts believe certain economic factors could trigger a strong rebound amid these concerns. Crypto expert and Abra CEO Bill Barhydt has pointed to key macroeconomic trends that could drive the expected Bitcoin price resurgence. The Economic Thesis to Fuel Bitcoin Price Growth According to his latest X post, Bill Barhydt remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s direction despite the market correction. He sounded confident about this position as he compared this recent development to previous cycles. Bill noted that this pullback follows the same pattern in 2017. For context, market data pointed out that rising fiat liquidity increased asset prices. Similarly, the Abra CEO suggested President Donald Trump’s administration would likely introduce 3 key monetary policies. This includes lowering treasury rates to refinance debt, lowering mortgage rates to unlock housing and credit markets, and lowering the treasury to save banks from mass insolvency. He added that China’s economic struggles could lead to further U.S. rate cuts, which may reinforce global liquidity flows. Barhydt states these factors likely fuel a strong BTC price recovery. Some models predict Bitcoin could reach as high as $713,000 in the next six months if market conditions align. Crypto Market Outlook Due to the fragile digital asset economy, the market has seen terrific crypto liquidations in recent times. The Bitcoin price decline has triggered widespread sell-offs, with major institutional holders facing substantial losses. Notably, Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which holds the largest share of Bitcoin in circulation, has seen the value of its holdings drop. Per reports, it dropped from $21.2 billion to approximately $17.3 billion. Yet, the Abra CEO is encouraging the market not to be distressed. Bill added that this correction differs from previous market cycles, where Bitcoin has gained more value after similar downturns. For him, if history teaches anything, as liquidity increases and investor confidence stabilizes, the crypto market will soon recover. Policy and Regulatory Shifts It is important to state that regulatory and policy changes in the U.S. could also play a crucial role in Bitcoin’s next major move. For example, President Donald Trump’s executive order introduced a strategic Bitcoin reserve , utilizing seized digital assets. Likewise, the recent friendliness of the US security agency, featuring the dismissal of the Kraken lawsuit and other crypto firms, teases a clearer crypto framework could be in play. However, while Bitcoin price faces short-term volatility, the convergence of economic stimulus, historical market resilience, and evolving regulatory frameworks suggests the potential for a strong recovery. Analysts believe that if liquidity trends hold and institutional investments continue, Bitcoin could soon re-enter a bullish phase.

The recent decline has pushed the leading cryptocurrency below the 200-day moving average (MA), raising concerns about a potential deeper pullback. Bitcoin Must Defend This Key Price Level According to an X post by seasoned crypto analyst Ali Martinez, BTC is now trading below the 200-day MA, a key price level that has historically functioned as a strong support for the top digital asset. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sellers Incur Loss As SOPR Drops To 0.95 – A Sign Of Market Bottom? For the uninitiated, the 200-day MA is a famous technical indicator that essentially represents the average closing price of BTC over the last 200 days to identify the long-term price trend. Historically, a sustained movement above the 200-day MA has led to long-term uptrends while a prolonged price movement below the level has often preceded further declines. Martinez stressed that BTC must remain above the TD Sequential indicator’s risk line at $79,280. He added that a sustained move above this level could set the stage for a strong rebound to the upside. The potential for a BTC recovery was echoed by fellow crypto analyst Ted. In a post on X, he pointed out that over the past two years, BTC has frequently undergone 25% to 30% corrections before rebounding to new all-time highs (ATHs). Ted noted: In 2023, BTC went from $30K to $22K. In 2024, BTC went from $74K to $50K. This year, BTC has dumped from $109K to $79K. We all know what happened after the last 2 major corrections. If BTC follows a similar pattern and climbs 30% from its current price, it could reach approximately $104,000 in a short period. However, broader macroeconomic factors – such as US President Donald Trump’s trade tariffs and the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) monetary policy – could significantly impact BTC’s trajectory. BTC Needs To Reclaim $84,000 First In another post on X, Martinez outlined BTC’s potential path to a new ATH, emphasizing that BTC must first reclaim $84,000 as a support level before any major upside movement. Once this milestone is secured, the digital asset could rally toward $128,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Fills CME Gap Between $78,000 and $80,000 – Is A Reversal Around The Corner? Several indicators suggest that BTC may have already found a local bottom, increasing the chances of a trend reversal. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital recently noted that BTC’s plunge to $78,258 could mark the cycle low. Additionally, the US Dollar Index (DXY) has just recorded one of its largest weekly breakdowns since 2013, a move that historically signals bullish momentum for risk-on assets like BTC. At press time, BTC trades at $80,137, down 3.5% in the past 24 hours.

Beyond the usual buzz around Bitcoin and Ethereum, discerning investors are turning their attention to a fresh lineup of altcoins that might offer outsized rewards. While the crypto scene is replete with fleeting trends, only a select few coins demonstrate the robust fundamentals, increasing adoption, and tangible applications that could lead to significant market breakthroughs. At the forefront of these promising crypto ventures is Web3Bay, accompanied by other solid contenders like Solana, XRP, Hedera, and Sui, all poised for significant attention. Web3Bay (3BAY) – Revolutionizing Market Transactions with Blockchain In an era where giants such as Amazon and eBay dominate with steep fees and centralized control, Web3Bay is carving a niche in the decentralized market landscape. This platform is engineered to offer a secure, transparent, and cost-effective trading space, granting users complete authority over their dealings and personal information. Far from the fleeting allure of meme coins, Web3Bay addresses genuine challenges by cutting out the middlemen in online transactions. The excitement from investors about Web3Bay is palpable. Its presale has successfully garnered over $1.6 million, selling over 400 million tokens, making it a standout in this year’s early-stage crypto initiatives. Its structured pricing strategy promotes gradual growth, with the current presale rate at $0.00524, a 15% increase from the previous price of $0.00456. With continuing demand, many market analysts are touting Web3Bay as potentially one of the top performers in 2025, possibly yielding returns up to 500 times for those who invest early. Solana (SOL) – Pioneering Speed and Efficiency in Blockchain Technology Solana continues to assert its dominance in the blockchain arena with its incredibly fast transactions and minimal fees. It ranks as a leading Layer-1 network, drawing interest from NFT creators, DeFi communities, and large-scale investors in search of a scalable blockchain foundation. With the market buzzing, Solana is on the brink of what could be a significant upswing, with market experts eyeing the $200 mark as a critical threshold. As more developers gravitate towards Solana’s platform, the investment community is poised for potentially record-setting gains in SOL. XRP (XRP) – Expanding Reach in the Financial Sector The appeal of XRP grows as more institutional players delve into this digital asset. Brazil’s recent approval of the first spot ETF for XRP has sparked conversations about possible U.S. approval, revitalizing interest in the currency. With XRP’s price still below its historic peaks, investors see a prime opportunity for substantial returns in the forthcoming market upswing. As Bitcoin’s ascent continues, market forecasters suggest XRP could achieve new heights, positioning it as a top altcoin to invest in for substantial, long-term rewards. Hedera (HBAR) – Securing the Future with Advanced Blockchain Solutions Hedera distinguishes itself with its hashgraph consensus mechanism, enhancing speed, security, and efficiency beyond traditional blockchain systems. This technology has garnered the attention of global giants like Google, IBM, and Boeing, who are integrating Hedera’s solutions for high-level applications. As Hedera expands its footprint in DeFi and tokenization, it’s increasingly viewed as one of the market’s top altcoins to invest in due to its underestimated potential. With its continued adoption and strategic alliances, market analysts recommend HBAR as a pivotal addition to any forward-thinking crypto investment portfolio. Sui (SUI) – Redefining Scalability in Blockchain Platforms Sui is making waves in the realm of smart contracts by offering a platform that is both efficient and scalable for developers. Setting itself apart from Ethereum and Solana, Sui avoids the common pitfall of network congestion by implementing parallel transaction processing, which enhances its scalability. Despite some volatility in its price, the Sui ecosystem is on an upward trajectory with a continuous influx of new projects and DeFi applications. As adoption keeps increasing, Sui is poised to be a top altcoin to invest in and one of the standout Layer-1 networks in 2025, making it a valuable asset for any diversified crypto investment strategy. Final Insights – Spotlight on Web3Bay’s Potential While Solana, XRP, Hedera, and Sui each present considerable investment opportunities, Web3Bay stands out as the front-runner for 2025. Its decentralized approach to e-commerce, coupled with a booming presale and growing market acceptance, sets the stage for potential monumental growth in the near future. For investors aiming to capitalize on their investments, Web3Bay should be considered before its next anticipated price surge. This presents a unique chance to get involved early in one of the most rapidly expanding crypto presales. Are you prepared to claim your stake in what could be the most lucrative phase of this top altcoin to invest in? Don’t miss your chance to be part of this exciting growth journey.

It is true that Cramer said there are situations where getting away from the market makes sense, but when he was advising about getting out at the Haines Bottom, he said he said it in the context of investors taking their money in the next five years. He acknowledged that the market went down significantly from when he first issued the warning but emphasized that those who began buying near the market bottom had strong returns over time. The recent market maelstrom has been fed by a mix of forces—from concerns over rising inflation to Federal Reserve interest rate policy to geopolitical anxiety. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq have been hit hard in recent weeks, with technology stocks suffering particularly sharply. Investors are also considering hesitation over earnings reports and fears of a global economic slowdown. As crazy as it gets, Cramer still swears by his long-term belief that long-term investors should own high-quality stocks while not panic-selling every time the market goes south. He highlighted historical comebacks following prior sell-offs, such as the COVID-19 market crash of 2020, when markets rebounded sharply after reaching the bottom. Cramer highlights buying opportunities in the tech and defensive sectors Shares of mega-cap tech names such as Apple, Microsoft, and Meta — and have all recently been sold off — “still have good fundamentals,” Cramer said, and “might represent the kind of buying opportunity you’ll want long-term.” He also emphasized defensive sectors that tend to do well in turbulent economic times, like healthcare, consumer staples, and energy. Cramer noted that people should invest in the stock of quality companies to benefit more significantly over a longer period of time. He noted that the vast majority of gains in the market happen on just several key days each year. He warned investors against trying to time the market, as missing those key recovery days can have a big impact on long-term returns. Ending market declines follow a historical pattern in which markets eventually recover from downturns. The Haines Bottom of 2009 is an excellent example of how investor psychology can change at the drop of a hat, giving rise to large gains for those who remained invested. “Think of it like this: days like today are what kept you out of the big gains in the same stocks. Most people never get back,” he said. “They don’t buy, they forget, or they think that they can’t tempt fate or the market’s too brutal.” Jonny Cramer Cramer’s message when he said it: While the market sell-off now is troubling, history teaches that continuing to invest in strong companies pays off over time.

Or watched Shiba Inu skyrocket while you sat on the sidelines? If you’ve been waiting for the next big short-term crypto play, now’s your chance to act. The meme coin market is booming, and some projects are showing signs of serious growth. Right now, BTFD Coin ($BTFD) is the talk of the town with its highly rewarding referral program and presale momentum. With over $6.28 million already raised, this presale is closing fast, and early investors are locking in their spots before the price jumps. Alongside BTFD, Dogwifhat ($WIF), Floki Inu ($FLOKI), and Brett ($BRETT) are also gaining traction in the crypto space. If you’re looking for the best cryptos to buy for short term , these four deserve a closer look. BTFD Coin: The Referral Program That’s Rewarding Early Investors Big Time BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme token—it’s building a movement while giving investors multiple ways to earn. One of its most exciting features is its referral program, which allows holders to earn free $BTFD tokens by spreading the word. Here’s how it works: For every person who uses your referral code to buy $50+ in BTFD, they get an extra 10% bonus in tokens. You, as the referrer, earn 10% of their purchase amount in BTFD coins at the end of the month if you rank in the top 20 referrers. The leaderboard resets on the 1st of each month, meaning new investors always have a shot at earning big rewards. Now, let’s talk about the presale. BTFD Coin is currently in Stage 14, priced at $0.00016 per token. With over 71 billion tokens sold and 11,300+ holders, momentum is building fast. And here’s the kicker—analysts predict a $0.0006 listing price, meaning early investors could see a 3.75X return at launch. But what happens if BTFD Coin reaches its predicted moon price of $0.006? A $9,000 investment today at $0.00016 would give you 56.25 million BTFD tokens. If the price climbs to $0.0006 at launch, that investment could be worth $33,750. And if it skyrockets to $0.006, you’d be sitting on a massive $337,500. Why did this coin make it to this list? BTFD Coin’s referral program, booming presale, and insane upside potential make it one of the best cryptos to buy for short term gains. How to Buy BTFD Coins? To grab BTFD before the presale closes, set up MetaMask or Trust Wallet, load it with BNB or ETH, and visit the BTFD presale page to purchase. The earlier you buy, the more tokens you secure at this low price. Dogwifhat: The Solana Meme Coin That’s Dominating the Charts Dogwifhat ($WIF) started as a meme, but quickly became a Solana powerhouse. This coin has gained massive community support, fueled by its simple yet catchy branding. WIF is a pure meme coin, but its strong trading volume and hype cycle have kept it in the spotlight. Since launching, WIF has consistently ranked among the top Solana-based meme coins, proving that meme culture and community backing are enough to push a project forward. It has no roadmap or utility, but that hasn’t stopped traders from betting big on its short-term potential. Why did this coin make it to this list? Dogwifhat’s rapid rise, massive trading volume, and Solana’s ecosystem growth make it a solid choice for short-term gains. Floki Inu: The Utility-Packed Meme Coin With DeFi Potential Floki Inu ($FLOKI) isn’t just a meme—it’s a full-fledged ecosystem. Launched by Shiba Inu community members, FLOKI has carved out its niche by integrating DeFi, NFTs, and metaverse utilities into its platform. What makes FLOKI stand out? FlokiFi – A decentralized finance (DeFi) platform for staking and earning. Valhalla Metaverse – A play-to-earn gaming experience. Massive global community, thanks to its branding and marketing campaigns. With major exchange listings and ongoing ecosystem development, FLOKI has positioned itself as more than just a meme—it’s an investment with multiple growth angles. Why did this coin make it to this list? Floki Inu combines meme power with real DeFi and metaverse utility, giving it strong short-term and long-term upside. Brett: The Meme Coin That’s Taking Over Base Chain Brett ($BRETT) has quickly become the mascot of Base Chain, the Layer 2 blockchain developed by Coinbase. Inspired by Matt Furie’s Boys’ Club comics, Brett has gained cult-like community support, leading to explosive price action. What makes Brett interesting is that it’s heavily tied to Base Chain’s success. With Coinbase backing Base and meme coin traders flocking to the chain, BRETT has positioned itself as the leading meme project in that ecosystem. The fixed supply of 10 billion tokens also adds a deflationary aspect, making each token more valuable as demand increases. Why did this coin make it to this list? Brett’s cultural relevance, strong community backing, and connection to Base Chain make it a potential short-term moonshot. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, these are the best cryptos to buy for short term if you’re looking for quick, high-potential gains. Dogwifhat is thriving in the Solana ecosystem, Floki Inu is expanding its DeFi and metaverse reach, and Brett is becoming the face of Base Chain. But if you’re looking for a short-term play with immediate rewards, BTFD Coin is the one to watch. With its 10% referral rewards, booming presale, and strong post-launch predictions, it offers multiple ways to earn fast. The presale won’t last forever—Stage 14 is almost sold out, and once the next stage kicks in, the price will go up. If you want to secure BTFD at $0.00016 before the next price increase, now is the time to act. Join the BTFD Coin presale now before it’s too late. FAQs What makes BTFD Coin different from other meme coins? BTFD Coin has a highly rewarding referral program, a live P2E game, and 90% APY staking rewards, making it one of the best cryptos to buy for short term gains. How does the BTFD referral program work? Users earn 10% in free BTFD tokens when they refer buyers, and if they rank in the top 20 referrers, they get an additional bonus at the end of the month. Is Dogwifhat a good short-term investment? Dogwifhat has seen massive growth in the Solana ecosystem, and with strong trading volume, it remains a popular meme coin for short-term trading.

This Altcoin Is Ready To Surpass DOGE in 2025,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/missed-dogecoin-doge-back-in-the-day-this-altcoin-is-ready-to-surpass-doge-in-2025/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) valued at $0.04 when Elon Musk launched his viral tweet expanded to reach a maximum of $0.074 during 2021. The downturn of DOGE value since its high mark of $0.7376 leads the market toward a new emerging token built for continuous growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has succeeded as a decentralized lending protocol to attract investors who did not participate in the Dogecoin rally. Mutuum Finance awaits buyers at $0.015 during Phase 2 of its presale. The project has gained over $2.7 million from about 4,900 investors. The strong 85% completion rate of Phase 2 gives analysts confidence that MUTM will surpass meme coins including DOGE by 2025 because it has real-world application and systematic tokenomics. The second phase of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale maintains strong momentum The popularity of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) does not stem from viral trends. The presale process of MUTM depends on decentralized lending which unites overcollateralized loans along with peer-to-peer negotiations and revenue-sharing components. The presale’s second phase starts at $0.015 while promising early buyers a 33% profit when Phase 3 launches at $0.02. The exchange listing price of the token stands at $0.06 after its presale process which initiates at $0.015 but eventually reaches $0.06. This valuation brings 300% growth according to current market rates. The current value of $1,000 investment stands to become $4,000 during Phase 3 launch. MUTM anticipates rapid price appreciation to between $3.50 and $5 during the next few months as more users join the platform based on post-listing expert estimates. The mtTokens system embedded within the protocol enhances its offer to users. People who deposit ETH or DAI into the protocol can receive interest-bearing mtETH or mtDAI tokens that retain transferability throughout all DeFi platforms. The system offers dual functionality for earning passive income while still maintaining liquidity in ways that differ fundamentally from how Dogecoin works since it depends on social media trends. MUTM investors receive dividends from platform fees since a part of these fees automatically purchases MUTM tokens which are distributed to stakers thus reducing the risk of sell-offs. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Ecosystem Incentivizes Long-Term Holding Mutuum Finance (MUTM establishes mechanisms which prevent the problems associated with short-term speculation activities. MUTM embraces community engagement by giving its first ten participants $10,000 each from its $100,000 presale giveaway funds yet it avoids excessive token promotion. Secured overcollateralized lending on MUTM registers as a feature which attracts lenders who prioritize protection against defaults. The P2P system through MUTM allows borrowers to access loans with terms that offer the option for DOGE and SHIB transactions which standard pools normally do not support. MUTM’s growth path will be strengthened by the implementation of Tokenomics. Following presale distribution the released supply will remain at 20% which creates scarcity throughout the market. Surging prices are predicted due to both scarce token economics and the buy-and-distribute model. Buyers who purchased MUTM tokens during presale at $0.015 might earn substantial gains of up to 23,233% if the project reaches $3.50 within the market because analysts predict such high potential based on revenue-based token burns and rising user numbers. Time is critical. The fast speed at which Phase 2 fills funds demonstrates the same sense of emergency that led Phase 1 to sell out in a few days. The period to acquire MUTM at presale rates before exchange listings becomes shorter by the day. Investors who passed up on DOGE during its historic rise are turning their attention to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) because they understand its combination of DeFi development and massive financial returns. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently duplicating Dogecoin’s initial market gains after eliminating its usual price fluctuations in the crypto market. MUTM possesses the potential to outperform DOGE as well as reinvent DeFi investment criteria through its operational framework combined with its visible token distribution structure alongside continuous buy-driven market activity. Purchase your tokens now since Phase 3 will launch another price increase in the market.

The order is expected to address regulatory policies that limited crypto companies’ access to banking services, according to sources familiar with the matter. Donald Trump Executive Order on Crypto Banking Barriers The upcoming Donald Trump executive order is expected to roll back rules linked to “Operation Chokepoint 2.0,” a term used to describe efforts that allegedly pressured banks to deny services to crypto-related businesses. The initiative, widely discussed by industry leaders, suggested that the previous administration discouraged financial institutions from working with the crypto sector. White House officials confirmed that steps are being taken to remove these restrictions. Bo Hines, Executive Director of the Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets, stated, “I think that the industry can expect something in short order there.” However, specific details regarding the content of the executive order have not yet been disclosed. Potential Changes to Federal Reserve Policies The Donald Trump executive order may also target Federal Reserve policies that restricted crypto-focused banks from obtaining master accounts. These accounts allow banks to transact directly with the Federal Reserve and are essential for operating nationwide. During the Biden administration, banks like Custodia were denied master accounts, limiting their ability to offer financial services to crypto firms. Despite increasing calls for change, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) have not yet rescinded any anti-crypto guidance. Last month, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged concerns over crypto debanking , stating that he was “struck” by the growing number of cases and that the Fed would take a “fresh look” at the issue. Custodia Bank CEO Caitlin Long has criticized the Fed and FDIC for their approach to crypto banking, stating that they were “far more detrimental to crypto banking” than the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), which recently rescinded its restrictive crypto banking guidance. Elizabeth Warren Signals Support for Crypto Banking Access Senator Elizabeth Warren, has also expressed a willingness to work with the Trump administration to address debanking issues. During a recent Senate Banking Committee hearing, Warren stated, “Debanking is a real problem. This shouldn’t be happening, and we need to fix it.” Her position represents a shift in her approach to cryptocurrency regulation. While she has previously advocated for stricter oversight, Warren now appears to support ensuring that banks do not deny services to crypto firms without clear justification. Trump’s Continued Focus on Cryptocurrency Policy This Donald Trump executive order would be the third related to cryptocurrency since Trump returned to office. The first order, signed in January, established the Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets. The second, signed last week, directed the creation of a U.S. government strategic Bitcoin reserve and a separate digital asset stockpile. Reports suggest that the upcoming order may include provisions related to stablecoins, stating that they should not be classified as securities. If signed, this order could introduce major regulatory changes affecting the cryptocurrency industry, particularly in the banking sector. A senior White House official stated that legal considerations are being reviewed before the order is finalized. While no specific date has been confirmed, sources suggest the signing could take place within the week.

Higher yields are said to signal market optimism traditionally, but Japan’s current economic situation on the ground has everyday residents worried about a massive downturn. Japan 10-year government bond yields hit a peak not seen since the 2008 economic downturn on Monday, as big investors signaled confidence in the market, expecting further interest rate hikes from the Bank of Japan (BoJ) and greater stabilization. The BoJ previously raised the benchmark rate by 25 basis points in January, to the current level of 0.5% — a level not seen in 17 years. The bond yield rate tapped a high of 1.591% at 3:40 p.m. (JST). Typically, investors flee to perceived low-risk assets like government bonds in times of economic uncertainty, or when inflation — and its subsequent remedial rate hikes — is expected. As the short-term, central bank-dictated interest rate rises, however, holders of older bonds with lower yield rates locked in have a hard time selling them, as market actors can now enter and buy new bonds with a higher yield, resulting in prices for these securities being forced downward. Japan’s benchmark yield rate for 10-year government bonds hit its highest levels since 2008 on Monday. Source: MarketWatch. Further, markets being flooded with money can coincide with increasing yields. This is likely what happened back in 2008 , after the U.S. government intervened to bail out the banking industry. Investor confidence in riskier assets returned, money exited back into the wider market, and bond prices fell as their yields inversely climbed, incentivizing investment back into these long-term securities. What the rising bond rate means for Japan While Japan’s 10-year government bond yield rate has cooled slightly at the time of writing, some market watchers, like CEO of SBI Global Asset Management Tomoya Asakura, say the rate could reach levels as high as 2%. Asakura noted on social media platform X (translated): “The 10-year yen bond yield has reached a level not seen since the Lehman Shock, with a 2.0% yield in sight.” He continued by stating that “The market is not yet prepared for this impact.” Asakura fears the impact of “rising borrowing costs” for businesses and consumers, as well as the effects of a stronger yen on export companies. Further, the CEO predicts an increase in the interest payment burden on the BoJ for yen bonds held by the institution. Asakura’s post on X. More fiscally conservative voices view the tightening as a positive signal, while on the ground, everyday residents of the archipelago continue to suffer under both hawkish and dovish policies, regardless. Whether by way of a stronger JPY and attendant higher borrowing costs, or a weaker yen and continued out-of-control inflation, it looks like things will invariably get harder for low-wage earners. If Asakura’s warnings come true, the result could even be a 2008-style market collapse. Trading Economics detailed the bond yield surge, reporting on data from January: “Inflation-adjusted real wages—a key measure of consumer purchasing power—fell 1.8% year-on-year, marking the first decline in three months.” Notably, Japan is also facing a challenging influx of tourists , incentivized by state-sponsored benefits such as free domestic air travel, making it harder for locals to live economically viable lives even in their own communities.

The order is expected to target policies under “Operation Chokepoint 2.0,” which seeks to roll back these restrictions and support the crypto industry. Bo Hines, Executive Director of the White House’s Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets, confirmed that administrative action is coming but didn’t provide details. He mentioned that the industry can expect something soon. Hines also emphasized that the Trump administration aims to end practices linked to “Operation Chokepoint 2.0,” a term coined by Nic Carter, which refers to efforts similar to the Obama-era Operation Choke Point that targeted payday lenders and gun dealers. Trump’s Executive Order Could Open Fed Access to Crypto Banks While details of Trump’s executive order are still being finalized, it could impact Federal Reserve policies on master accounts. These accounts, held by federally chartered banks, are essential for making direct payments and accessing the Fed’s services. Under the Biden administration, the Fed denied master accounts to crypto-focused banks like Custodia, hindering their growth. Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett remarked that this is significant because the Federal Reserve and the FDIC have not yet reversed any anti-crypto policies, even though Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell mentioned last month that he was concerned by the increasing number of crypto debanking cases and that the Fed would “take a fresh look” at the issue. https://twitter.com/EleanorTerrett/status/1899213132272447631 Trump Administration Pushes Forward Despite Challenges While the Federal Reserve operates independently from the White House, the Trump administration is pushing forward with its crypto order, despite potential legal hurdles. Sources note that senior White House officials are set to meet Thursday to assess possible challenges before putting the order on Trump’s desk. However, a White House official denied any such meeting is scheduled but confirmed that efforts to roll back Operation Chokepoint 2.0 are already in motion. The race to reshape crypto policy is heating up, and all eyes are on what comes next. Directive on Stablecoins? The upcoming executive order could extend beyond banking, and might include a directive stating that stablecoins, which are designed to maintain a stable value and are typically pegged to the U.S. dollar, should not be classified as securities. If Trump signs this order, it would be his third crypto-related executive action since returning to office. The first, signed on January 23, created a Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets. The second, signed last week, ordered the establishment of a U.S. government Bitcoin reserve and a separate stockpile for other digital assets. Bitcoin Dips Despite The Developments Trump’s recent Crypto Summit disappointed industry leaders, with his Bitcoin reserve plan failing to boost the market as the administration plans to use seized assets. Broader economic policies, including tariffs on China and others, have also shaken markets. As a result, institutional investors pulled funds from Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, causing Bitcoin to fall below $80,000 for the first time in 4 months and Ethereum to drop to $1,870.",News|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,FIAT|REGULATION|BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS|ETH,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-11 02:19:47

That’s a 30% decline from its all-time high of $110,000, and the sell-off isn’t just hitting crypto—stocks are also in freefall. But according to Arthur Hayes, traders need to wait it out. “The plan: Be fucking patient,” Hayes said in a post on X. He predicted Bitcoin would likely bottom at $70,000, which would be a 36% correction from its peak—something he called “very normal for a bull market.” But he made it clear that crypto isn’t bouncing back on its own. Hayes said the next steps were for stocks to crash, a major traditional finance institution to go under, and central banks to start printing money again before things turn around. “Then you load up the truck,” he said . BTC price chart. Source: Jai Hamid/TradingView Hayes also said, in a separate post, that: “BTC trades 24/7, anyone globally with internet can trade, it cannot be printed, failure results in bankruptcy or liquidation. No country’s finances are tied to BTC going up in price. Stocks trade 8/5, only certain people can trade them, they cannot be printed, failure if you are politically connected results in a bailout. Marginal tax receipts in Pax Americana are directly tied to the stock market. It will get a bailout, it just depends on whether your portfolio is still alive when it occurs.” Stock market tanks while Bitcoin slides This crash isn’t just a Bitcoin problem. The Nasdaq 100 dropped 1,050 points in a single day, a 5.8% loss, and after-hours trading saw another 300-point drop. If the market had stayed open, it would have been just 1.2% away from a circuit breaker halt, something that only happens when things are in full panic mode. Futures trading isn’t looking any better. S&P 500 futures slipped 0.4%, Nasdaq-100 futures fell 0.9%, and Dow Jones futures dropped slightly, down 20 points. But Delta Air Lines took the biggest hit, plunging 11% after-hours after slashing its profit and sales forecast due to weak U.S. travel demand. SPX S&P 500 Index chart. Source: TradingView Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has now logged three consecutive losing weeks, with Monday’s session adding to the pain. The Dow Jones lost nearly 900 points, falling below its 200-day moving average for the first time since November 1, 2023. The Nasdaq Composite had its worst day since September 2022. “This is starting to feel like a capitulation in the market,” said Anastasia Amoroso, chief investment strategist at iCapital, on CNBC’s Closing Bell. She said markets were reaching oversold levels, predicting that things would either hit rock bottom immediately or sometime this week. Peter Schiff slams Bitcoin, investors wait for economic data Peter Schiff, known for his anti-Bitcoin stance, wasted no time in trashing crypto after the latest drop. “Now that Bitcoin fell below $77K, it’s down 30% from its January record high,” Schiff wrote on X. He questioned how the U.S. government could consider Bitcoin as a reserve asset when it can lose value so quickly. “The rationale will be even harder to see when it’s down 50%,” he added. Schiff then tied the crash to U.S. manufacturing, saying that with crypto millionaires losing money, the country would need to bring back industrial jobs. Investors are now bracing for key economic reports this week. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) comes out on Tuesday, followed by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Wednesday and the Producer Price Index (PPI) on Thursday. These reports could decide whether inflation fears will push the Federal Reserve toward more aggressive rate cuts. Market volume also spiked during Monday’s trading session. More than 82% of stocks on the Nasdaq ended the day in the red, while 76% of New York Stock Exchange stocks also dropped. Declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones 4 to 1, and new 52-week lows on the Nasdaq hit 413, compared to just 69 new highs. Meanwhile, crypto-related stocks collapsed. Coinbase dropped 17.6%, Robinhood fell 19.8%, and MicroStrategy, now rebranded as Strategy, saw its stock price tank by 16%. Bitcoin ETFs see outflows, Trump comments on recession The Bitcoin ETF market has also taken a beating. Outflows totaled $867 million last week, making it the fourth straight week of withdrawals, according to CoinShares. That brings the total four-week outflows to $4.75 billion, as bearish sentiment continues to push prices down. The broader crypto market took another hit over the weekend, with Bitcoin briefly dropping to $80,000 for the first time since February 28th. Adding to the uncertainty, Donald Trump weighed in on the economy during a Fox News interview, calling it a “period of transition.” His comments followed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s statement that the U.S. could go through a “detox period” as the administration cuts federal spending. Source: Farside Goldman Sachs has also revised its economic growth forecast downward, citing concerns over Trump’s tariff policies. But despite all the chaos, Amoroso dismissed recession fears, pointing to strong payroll reports and steady consumer spending at 3-4%. Meanwhile, the White House is downplaying the weeks-long stock market sell-off, insisting that recent moves by business leaders suggest a brighter outlook for the U.S. economy. “We’re seeing a strong divergence between animal spirits of the stock market and what we’re actually seeing unfold from businesses and business leaders,” the White House told reporters Monday afternoon. “The latter is obviously more meaningful than the former on what’s in store for the economy in the medium to long term,” said the White House. Still, the combination of a weak stock market, crypto outflows, and uncertainty in macroeconomics has traders on edge. Many are waiting for central banks to step in, just like Hayes predicted. The Federal Reserve, the PBOC, the ECB, and the BOJ could all be forced to ease policies to support their economies. For now, though, the message from Hayes is clear: Wait.

Since hitting that level, the cryptocurrency has steadily declined, now trading below $80,000 as of today. While the short-term price action suggests a bearish outlook, some analysts remain confident about Bitcoin’s potential for long-term growth. Bitcoin’s Price Outlook: $180K Within Reach? One of CryptoQuant’s contributors to the QuickTake platform, ibrahimcosar, recently shared his perspective on Bitcoin’s price trajectory, offering a bold prediction for its next all-time high (ATH). In his latest analysis, the analyst reiterated his long-term expectation that Bitcoin could reach $180,000 by 2026, citing historical price cycles and institutional projections that align with his forecast. According to Ibrahim, Bitcoin’s price movements over the past year have followed a familiar pattern seen in previous bull cycles. The analyst pointed out that major financial institutions have recently begun making similar long-term projections, validating his earlier forecasts. While Bitcoin currently trades below $80,000, he believes that the asset has the potential to more than double in value within the next two years. If Bitcoin follows historical patterns, the $150K–$200K range could be achieved in the upcoming bull cycle. The analyst emphasized that investors who enter the market at current levels could see over 100% returns, provided Bitcoin reaches its predicted target by 2026. However, he also noted that timing the market correctly is crucial, as buying at key support levels has historically presented the most favorable opportunities for long-term gains. Ibrahim wrote: In summary, those investing in Bitcoin at these levels have the potential to gain over 100% in dollar terms without even waiting a year. Buying in the right regions and at the right times can present significant opportunities. Short-Term Market Trends and Buying Opportunities While long-term projections remain bullish, Bitcoin’s short-term price action continues to fluctuate. Another CryptoQuant analyst, BilalHuseynov, provided insights into open interest (OI) trends, which may indicate whether this is a favorable time to buy Bitcoin. According to BilalHuseynov, the 7-day change in open interest has entered a “deleveraging” phase, a signal that has historically aligned with potential buying opportunities.

If historical trends repeat, the current market conditions could set the stage for a similar recovery. The CryptoQuant analyst noted: When the OI ratio’s change for 7 days down to the section, that means we can define the time to buy. Since August 2024, we have been observing one of the deepest areas in the Crypto Market. To remember, at this time (2024 Aug), Bitcoin’s price was around 58 – 60k. After that, the price goes up to ~106k.

This activity suggests renewed interest from institutional and high-net-worth investors, indicating confidence in the long-term trajectory of the Cardano price. Such accumulation phases have historically been linked to price stabilization and upward momentum. Whale Accumulation Signals Confidence In Cardano According to data from Santiment, wallets holding between 1,000,000 and 10,000,000 ADA have increased their holdings significantly. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted that these investors have accumulated over 180 million ADA within a short period, reflecting sustained interest despite market fluctuations. Whale accumulation is often linked to price movements, as large-scale purchases reduce circulating supply. This trend has previously preceded bullish phases in Cardano price, especially when buying pressure remains steady. Meanwhile, recent analysis shows that ADA price may rally as high as $36, aligning with the speculation fueled by the Simpsons’ prediction . Despite ADA’s current bearish trend, analysts point to key support at $0.70, growing market interest, and ETF discussions as potential catalysts for a strong recovery. Despite the strong accumulation, Cardano price has experienced fluctuations in recent weeks. Market analysts emphasize the importance of key support and resistance levels in determining whether the price will consolidate or break out into a new uptrend. Retail traders remain cautious, as past whale movements have not always resulted in immediate price gains. Analyst Eilert’s Take On Price Patterns Additionally, Crypto analyst Eilert observed that Cardano price is following a structure similar to its previous market cycle. In the last cycle, ADA retraced 52% from its high before entering an 11-week consolidation phase. This period of sideways movement allowed for accumulation before a significant breakout. Historical patterns suggest that similar price behavior has often led to strong bullish moves, especially when support levels hold. Currently, ADA has retraced 47% from its recent cycle high and is now in its fifth week of consolidation. This mirrors the past cycle, indicating that Cardano whale activity may be reinforcing a new accumulation phase. If the pattern continues, ADA could be positioned for a major price move, provided market conditions remain favorable. Source: X In the previous market cycle, the top altcoin rallied 4,000% from a similar support zone after a prolonged consolidation. While past trends do not guarantee future performance, historical data suggests that prolonged accumulation often precedes a price surge. At press time, Cardano price is trading at $0.6924, reflecting an 11.82% decline in the last 7 days. During this period, ADA dropped from a high of $0.7849, with its market cap shrinking by 7.37% to $24.39 billion.

The rising correlation between returns for bitcoin and the US stock market shows a closer relationship between the two assets in recent years. This year’s downturn for the S&P 500 appears to have been foreshadowed by bitcoin’s correction, which started earlier. By James Picerno The use case for bitcoin remains debatable, although there’s a growing focus on the cryptocurrency’s volatile price gyrations as a potential indicator of the risk appetite for the equities market and beyond. As the latest example, bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) began turning lower in mid-February while the stock market (S&P 500 Index) was at or near record highs (see chart below). This could be random behavior, but reviewing the return correlation between equities and bitcoin shows a closer relationship in recent years. The second chart below shows the rolling 1-year correlation for daily returns for the S&P and bitcoin. The linear trend since 2015 highlights a rising connection. The correlation between the two assets is currently around 0.4, which equates with a moderately positive relationship. By comparison, before 2020, the correlation remained below 0.2 and was, at times, negative. The closer link between the two assets suggests that bitcoin tends to be subject to the same risk-on and risk-off cycles as stocks. As such, to the extent that bitcoin has been a hedge for stock market risk, the efficacy of the hedge appears to be fading. At the same time, bitcoin’s wider and deeper integration into the financial ecosystem (albeit primarily as a speculative asset to date) seems to be enhancing the cryptocurrency’s price trends as an early indicator of changing risk sentiment. What’s the catalyst for bitcoin’s rising correlation with the stock market? The asset’s growing integration into the financial system is one possibility. As bitcoin has become an increasingly mainstream market (the launch of bitcoin ETFs and higher institutional allocations, for example) its short-term trends appear to have become more closely aligned with general investment flows. Although bitcoin is now more widely held and traded across the financial world’s ecosystem, one thing hasn’t changed for the asset: relatively short, dramatic trend cycles. As the third chart shows, the 6-month return history remains volatile. The extremes of a decade ago have subsided to a degree, but the hefty swings endure (at least by the standards of conventional assets). Because bitcoin remains heavily influenced by speculative investment flows, the ebb and flow of its price trends remain stark. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency’s market cap has surged and was recently estimated at roughly $1.5 trillion, which is more or less equivalent to the total market value of Meta ( META ) (Facebook). As a result, bitcoin’s price-trend shifts probably reflect a wider share of market sentiment generally. It’s open for debate how bitcoin’s role as an asset will evolve in the years ahead, but there’s a case for monitoring the price as a possible early sign of change in the market’s near-term appetite for risk.

Where do you report these things? Well, you go here, you go there, you go somewhere else,” Martin told Cointelegraph at the SXSW conference in Austin, Texas. “I’d love to see that addressed and really brought under one umbrella, and that then helps us get a better idea of the magnitude of the problem.” “That then helps drive resources from the whole federal government to do more to address some of the underlying causes, he added. The US has dozens of federal and state-level agencies that handle reports of financial and internet crimes, one of which is the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), which gives victims a way to report cybercrime. Martin said that crypto scam victims are reporting to authorities, but it “feels like they’re screaming into the void to like IC3 or some of the government reporting websites.” He added the various reporting sites should be consolidated “into a single reporting system that not only has all the data in one place but that also, in a perfect world, gives victims some visibility.” On an earlier panel regarding online fraud, in which Martin took part, retired FBI agent Roger Campbell said many victims of crypto romance scams search the internet for how to report the crime and “all kinds of information comes up.” “It’s kind of frustrating,” he said. Campbell gave the example of the UK as a country with an “awesome reporting system” where one portal is used to report all crimes, and victims can follow the status of their complaints. FBI’s Roger Campbell (center left) on a panel with Coinbase’s Philip Martin (center right). Other panelists include former Twitter safety lead Yoel Roth (right) and MSNBC reporter Mackenzie Sigalos (left). Source: Turner Wright / Cointelegraph “You report something to the IC3, you never hear anything back 99% of the time,” he added. “It gets frustrating again for the victim. They almost feel victimized again.” Related: ‘Victim-blaming’ Americans can deter crypto scams reporting — Regulator Coinbase’s Martin told Cointelegraph that scams have a “lag in reporting,” and the way that attackers carry out schemes today won’t be known for months . “A scam may have happened six months ago, and we might hear about it tomorrow,” he said. Another difficulty in policing crypto scams, according to Martin, is that they’re “by and large” conducted from outside the US in countries including Myanmar and Laos, where “it can be hard for law enforcement to reach into those areas and really sort of strangle the stuff at the root. “ He said combatting crypto scams should focus on international relations and the US, “making it a priority to work with governments around the world so that there’s no safe haven for these scammers.” Meanwhile, on March 10, the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation said it received over 2,600 complaints last year and found seven types of scams it hadn’t yet discovered, including crypto mining, gaming, jobs and giveaway scams.

The crypto world moves fast, and those who recognize the hottest opportunities early are the ones who make the biggest gains. With meme coins driving massive hype and speculation, finding the right projects at the right time is key. One of the most talked-about meme coins right now is BTFD Coin (BTFD)—a presale sensation that’s already raised $6.28 million, selling over 71 billion tokens and attracting more than 11,300 holders. With its play-to-earn (P2E) game, 90% APY staking, and a thriving Bulls Squad community, BTFD is shaping up to be one of the most exciting investments in the meme coin space. Alongside it, two other meme coins, Cat in a Dog’s World (MEW) and Mog Coin (MOG), are also making waves in the market. If you’re looking for the best new meme coins to buy today , these three could be worth your attention. Let’s break them down. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin That’s Redefining Play-to-Earn Gaming BTFD Coin is gaining serious momentum, and for good reason. It’s not just another meme coin—it’s a full-fledged ecosystem that includes a play-to-earn (P2E) game, a 90% APY staking opportunity, and a highly engaged community known as the Bulls Squad. With so many investors looking for the best new meme coins to buy today, BTFD Coin stands out as a project with actual utility and strong long-term potential. One of the biggest reasons investors are paying attention to BTFD is its fully launched P2E game, which went live on January 1, 2025. Unlike many meme coins that promise future utility, BTFD has already delivered. Players can earn $BTFD tokens by competing in various in-game challenges, making this project more than just hype—it has real engagement and adoption. With gaming and crypto colliding in a big way, P2E projects have been some of the best-performing assets in the last few years. Games like Axie Infinity and The Sandbox exploded in value when adoption surged, and BTFD is aiming to be the next big thing in the space. For investors who prefer to let their money work for them, BTFD offers a massive 90% APY staking reward—one of the highest in the meme coin market. That means if you stake your tokens, you’ll earn passive income just for holding. And let’s talk numbers. Right now, BTFD is in Stage 14 of its presale, selling at just $0.00016 per token. If the price hits its projected $0.0006 listing price, a $15,000 investment today would be worth $56,250 at launch. But here’s the real kicker—if BTFD reaches its predicted moon price of $0.006, that same investment could skyrocket to $562,500. With the presale gaining traction fast, it’s clear why BTFD Coin is one of the best new meme coins to buy today before prices rise in the next stage. How to Buy BTFD Coin Buying BTFD Coin is simple. Set up a MetaMask or Trust Wallet, load it with BNB, ETH, or USDT, and head over to the BTFD presale page . Connect your wallet, select the amount you want to invest, confirm the transaction, and once the presale ends, claim your $BTFD tokens. Why did this coin make it to this list? BTFD Coin stands out for its P2E game, high staking rewards, and incredible presale momentum. With analysts predicting a massive price jump, this project has strong fundamentals and real adoption, making it one of the best new meme coins to buy today. Cat in a Dog’s World (MEW): A Meme Coin Taking on the Dog Dominance The meme coin space has been dominated by dog-themed tokens for years, from Dogecoin to Shiba Inu and even Bonk. But MEW, the token behind Cat in a Dog’s World, is here to shake things up. Launched in March 2024, MEW has gained traction by positioning itself as the anti-dog meme coin. The project’s branding, community engagement, and Solana-based scalability have helped it attract early investors who believe in its underdog (or undercat?) potential.

In 2025, they’re not only thriving but also evolving into some of the most exciting and community-driven digital assets in the crypto space. Whether you’re in it for the fun, the potential for massive returns, or the thrill of viral trends, meme coins continue to capture the attention of investors worldwide. Some meme coins rely purely on community hype, while others are adding real-world use cases to their ecosystems. With a mix of established names and rising stars, picking the best new meme coins to invest in March 2025 can be a game-changer for your portfolio. One rising star that’s gaining attention is BTFD Coin , which is making waves with its innovative Referral Rewards Program, allowing investors to earn passive income while growing the community. Below, we’ve handpicked five meme coins that deserve your attention right now. 1. BTFD Coin – The Meme Coin That Rewards You for Spreading the Word In a sea of meme coins, BTFD Coin is carving out a unique niche with its Referral Rewards Program, offering investors a fresh way to grow their holdings while engaging their networks. Instead of simply relying on hype, BTFD Coin brings in an element of competition and rewards that sets it apart. Unlike most meme coins that rely solely on price speculation, BTFD Coin incentivizes user participation with a referral system that allows holders to earn passive rewards. By sharing a referral code, users can earn up to 10% of the total purchase amount of their referrals, paid out in BTFD tokens. Each month, the leaderboard resets, giving new investors a chance to compete for top referral spots. This structure keeps engagement high and fosters long-term commitment from the community—something many meme coins struggle with. The project has been gaining traction at an impressive pace. BTFD Coin is currently in its 14th presale stage, with a price of $0.00016 per token. So far, it has raised over $6.28 million, with more than 11,300 holders in the Bulls community. Over 71 billion BTFD tokens have already been sold, proving that demand is surging. As its presale continues to grow, BTFD Coin is one of the best new meme coins to invest in March 2025. 2. Dogecoin – The Legendary Meme Coin That Started It All No list of top meme coins would be complete without Dogecoin (DOGE)—the original meme token that remains a staple in the crypto market. Despite its humble beginnings as a joke, Dogecoin has cemented itself as a dominant force, surviving market crashes and thriving on strong community backing. Dogecoin continues to remain relevant because of its longevity and stability. It has outlived countless meme coins and remains one of the top cryptos by market cap. Beyond being a cultural phenomenon, Dogecoin has also gained real-world adoption. Major brands, including Tesla and AMC Theatres, now accept DOGE for payments. Grayscale has even launched a Dogecoin Trust, allowing institutional investors to gain exposure to the coin. Unlike newer meme coins, Dogecoin has already proven itself through multiple crypto market cycles. For investors seeking a more established meme coin, Dogecoin remains one of the best new meme coins to invest in March 2025. 3. Bonk – The Solana-Based Underdog with Strong Community Support Bonk (BONK) is a relative newcomer but has quickly become a fan favorite in the meme coin world. As the first major meme coin on the Solana network, it benefits from low transaction fees, high-speed transfers, and an ever-growing base of enthusiastic investors. Bonk is built on Solana, which gives it an advantage over Ethereum-based meme coins. Transactions are fast and cost just a fraction of a cent, making it easier for retail investors to trade without worrying about excessive gas fees. The Bonk community is also incredibly active, with a strong focus on decentralized governance and DeFi integrations. Recent token burns and ecosystem expansions have contributed to Bonk’s increasing scarcity, further fueling investor interest. With Solana-based tokens gaining traction and meme coins continuing to perform well, Bonk is one of the best new meme coins to invest in March 2025 for those looking to diversify beyond Ethereum-based meme assets. 4. Pudgy Penguins – A Meme Coin with a Strong Brand and NFT Connection If you’ve been in the NFT space, you’ve probably heard of Pudgy Penguins—one of the most successful NFT collections in history. Now, the Pudgy Penguins brand has entered the meme coin space with PENGU, a token designed to extend the brand’s reach into the crypto market. Pudgy Penguins has a massive following in the NFT space, which has naturally translated into strong demand for its token. The project has gone beyond digital assets by introducing physical merchandise and licensing deals, giving it an edge over other meme coins that rely solely on speculation. The team behind Pudgy Penguins recently burned over 12 billion tokens, reducing supply and potentially increasing scarcity-driven value. With an established brand and a growing ecosystem, Pudgy Penguins is easily one of the best new meme coins to invest in March 2025. Final Thoughts: Which Meme Coin Should You Buy? If you’re looking for the best new meme coins to invest in March 2025 , the choices above cover a range of investment styles—from referral-based rewards like BTFD Coin, to classic powerhouses like Dogecoin, emerging Solana plays like Bonk, utility-driven tokens like Dogs, and NFT-connected brands like Pudgy Penguins. Among them, BTFD Coin stands out for its innovative referral program, making it a unique investment opportunity for those who enjoy community-driven engagement and passive rewards. With its presale already raising nearly $6.28 million, this is a token worth keeping on your radar.

During a March 10 speech at the Washington Conference of the Institute of International Bankers, acting SEC Chairman Mark Uyeda said he had “asked SEC staff for options on abandoning” part of the proposed changes that would expand regulation of alternative trading systems (ATSs) to include crypto firms. “In light of the significant negative public comment received on the definition of exchange with respect to crypto, I have asked SEC staff for options on abandoning that part of the proposal,” he said. “In my view, it was a mistake for the commission to link together regulation of the Treasury markets with a heavy-handed attempt to tamp down the crypto market.” Uyeda says the rule was initially crafted in 2020 under former SEC Chairman Jay Clayton to establish more straightforward rules for alternative trading systems; the guidance was intended to mainly impact US Treasury market participants. Source: US Securities and Exchange Commission However, when it fell to former SEC Chair Gary Gensler to implement the rule, he took a “very different direction” by expanding the list beyond just ATSs. “Rather than focusing on the narrow issues relating to Government Securities ATSs, a new iteration of the rule was proposed in 2022 that would redefine the regulatory definition of an exchange,” Uyeda said. “The new definition of the term exchange included communications protocols without clearly defining what that term meant. Effectively, the vastly expanded definition of an exchange would have picked up various protocols used with respect to crypto assets,” he added. Related: Coinbase finds flawed analysis in SEC's proposed exchange definition Gensler’s time at the SEC came with an aggressive regulatory stance toward crypto . He brought upward of 100 regulatory actions against firms from 2021 until his resignation on Jan. 20, the same day as Donald Trump started his second term as US president. Trump had promised to fire Gensler if elected. After Genlers’ resignation, the SEC has since taken a new friendlier approach toward crypto. A growing number of firms facing legal action from the regulator have had their cases dismissed, including crypto exchange Gemini on Feb. 26, Kraken on March 3 and crypto trading firm Cumberland DRW on March 4 . Meanwhile, the agency has also launched a crypto task force dedicated to developing a framework for digital assets led by crypto-friendly Commissioner Hester Peirce.

Gox Moves $900M in Bitcoin, Sparking Concerns as Crypto Market Declines appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market continued its decline this week, with its market cap dropping to $2.44 trillion on Tuesday, the lowest since early November. This price drop triggered over $937 million in liquidations within 24 hours. Meanwhile, concerns grew as the defunct Mt. Gox exchange moved 11,833 BTC, worth $932 million. Mt. Gox has recently moved a significant amount of Bitcoin, totaling 11,834 BTC (worth approximately $910 million). This transfer includes 11,502 BTC (around $885 million) to a new wallet and 332 BTC (worth $25.5 million) to a “warm” wallet, which is typically used for transactions or active management of funds. https://twitter.com/spotonchain/status/1899263219065393536 Monday’s $900 million Bitcoin transfer came from the Mt. Gox wallet “1Mo1n,” which had received $1.07 billion in Bitcoin from another exchange last week. However, when the funds were moved last week, Arkham Intelligence didn’t recognize the “1Mo1n” address as a Mt. Gox wallet. The movement of Mt. Gox’s Bitcoin is closely watched because it is part of the ongoing process of repaying creditors who lost funds in the exchange’s infamous hack and bankruptcy. Just five days ago, Mt. Gox sent 166.5 BTC to BitGo, a digital asset custodian, likely as part of a creditor repayment process. The recent 332 BTC transfer is also expected to be moved soon, possibly as part of further repayments. The movement of Mt. Gox’s Bitcoin is significant for the broader crypto market because it could potentially flood the market with large amounts of Bitcoin if creditors decide to sell. This has raised concerns about potential market volatility. The creditors of Mt. Gox have been waiting years to receive their funds, and the repaid Bitcoin may be sold or held, depending on their decisions. Mt. Gox began repaying its creditors in July 2024 using its holdings of 142,000 BTC ($11 billion), 143,000 Bitcoin Cash ($47 million), and 69 billion yen ($469 million). While some creditors were paid through Kraken and Bitstamp, the repayment deadline was extended to October 31, 2025.

Economists at Wall Street investment bank JPMorgan have raised their recession risk this year to 40%, up from 30% at the beginning of 2025. “We see a material risk that the US falls into recession this year owing to extreme US policies,” wrote the analysts, according to The Wall Street Journal. Analysts at Goldman Sachs economists also raised their 12-month recession probability to 20%, up from 15%. They said that the forecast could rise further if the Trump administration remains “committed to its policies even in the face of much worse data.” Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley economists lowered their economic growth forecasts last week and raised inflation expectations. The bank predicted a GDP growth of just 1.5% in 2025, falling to 1.2% in 2026. It comes despite a key economic adviser to US President Donald Trump pushed back against talks of a recession. Speaking to CNBC on March 10, Kevin Hassett, who heads the National Economic Council, said there were many reasons to be optimistic about the US economy. “There are a lot of reasons to be extremely bullish about the economy going forward. But for sure, this quarter, there are some blips in the data,” he said. Meanwhile, in an interview with Fox News on March 9, Donald Trump responded to a question about the possibility of a recession by saying the US economy was going through “a period of transition.” Blockchain betting platform Polymarket quipped that recession odds are “the best looking chart in finance right now.” Source: Polymarket Tech stock and crypto sell-off The so-called “Trump bump” has dissipated, with the S&P 500 now lower than it was before his Nov. 5 US election victory.

The Magnificent 7 — America’s top tech firms — have had a tumultuous start to the week, collectively shedding more than $750 billion in market cap in one day. Tesla tanked a whopping 15%, becoming the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 this year. AI giant Nvidia lost 5.1%, Apple shed 4.9%, Meta fell 4.4% and Alphabet lost 4.5% on the day.

Doing so increases the likelihood that the US won’t need to refinance around $7 trillion in debt it owes over the next few months, Bitcoin commentator Anthony Pompliano said in a March 10 X post. US President Donald Trump and Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent are “taking matters into their own hands; they’re crashing asset prices in an attempt to force Jerome Powell to cut interest rates,” said Pompliano, who serves as the founder and CEO of Professional Capital Management and host of The Pomp Podcast. The President and his team are intentionally crashing the market. Is this a master plan or are we watching uncontrolled destruction?! pic.twitter.com/Tbc0M9Rjxu — Anthony Pompliano 🌪 (@APompliano) March 10, 2025 In late January, Powell announced the Fed was not lowering interest rates from the current target range of 4.25% to 4.5% despite calls from Trump to do so. Pompliano said the recent market panic has been driven in part by Trump’s tariffs — and has been used to create a more favorable bond market while lowering the 10-year Treasury yield. He noted that the 10-year Treasury yield is already down from nearly 4.8% in January to 4.21% now — a sign that Trump’s purported strategy is “heading in the right direction.” Source: Thomas Kralow Whether Pompliano’s theory is correct or not, the stock market has been tanking of late, and crypto has been hit even harder. Broad market index funds such as State Street’s Standard & Poor’s 500 index fund (SPY) fell 2.66% on March 10 alone, while the Nasdaq-100% fell 3.8%, Google Finance data shows. Both indexes are down 7.32% and 10.7% over the last month, while Bitcoin ( BTC ) is down 27.4% from its $108,786 all-time high, and over $1.2 trillion has been wiped from the cryptocurrency market cap since Dec. 17. If the stock market continues to tank, it will come down to a “who blinks first” contest between Trump and Powell, Pompliano said. While Trump hasn’t confirmed such a strategy, Pompliano pointed to a Fox News interview on March 9 where Trump said: “Nobody ever gets rich when the interest rates are high because people can’t borrow money.” Pompliano added that lowering interest rates would also benefit American consumers: “The big goal, get interest rates down, and that will lead to more economic activity, thanks to access to cheap capital. Give the people cheap capital and they’ll go and do things with it.” Related: Bitcoin dips to $80K in ‘ugly start,’ could retest key resistance: Hayes CME FedWatch, a tool used to measure expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate change, has tipped a 96% probability that the target rate will remain between 4.25% and 4.50% following the Federal Reserve’s next meeting on March 19. However, it’s near 50-50 odds for the target rate to be lowered in the Federal Reserve’s following meeting on May 7. The Federal Reserve typically avoids lowering interest rates when inflation is high , as one of its primary objectives is to maintain price stability. However, a Trump-inflicted recession, or “Trumpcession,” as some call it, could force America’s top bank to start cutting again.

This downturn comes despite the fact that many analysts remain optimistic about its long-term prospects. One particular technical analyst has now weighed in on when it would be wise to buy XRP, warning that its short-term outlook is shaky and its price may continue declining. Analyst Identifies The Ideal Buy Zone For XRP The past week has been challenging for XRP holders as the token has struggled to maintain key support levels. Its inability to hold these levels has pushed it closer to the $2 mark. However, the latest technical analysis suggests that this decline may not be over yet, and a further downside movement appears likely. Related Reading: Pundit Who Correctly Predicted XRP Price Crash To $2.5 Says Demand Zone Will Send It Soaring This XRP price decline has caused growing uncertainty among many retail investors, especially because XRP is increasingly becoming the choice of coin for retail investors in this cycle. Given XRP’s growing reputation as a retail favorite and its long-term bullish potential, this decline would be the best time for bullish investors to load up on more tokens. However, a crypto analyst recently warned that the current price is not the ideal entry point for those looking to capitalize on the coin’s bullish potential. Although XRP is one of the most promising cryptocurrencies from a technical perspective, the timing of purchases is also important. In a post on X, the analyst noted that XRP is the “retail coin,” often drawing attention from new investors who are convinced it will reach extreme price levels like $100. Despite this bullish momentum, he cautioned against buying at current prices, stating that the best time to enter would be if XRP dips to the $1.6 to $1.5 range. What this means is that the current trend suggests more downside movement in the short term, and it would be wiser to wait more before accumulating. Long-Term Bullish Case Despite Short-Term Weakness Even as XRP’s short-term outlook appears bearish, the analyst remains aligned with those expecting a major price surge in the future. Several technical analyses have painted an optimistic picture, with some projections placing the altcoin well beyond the double-digit threshold. One analyst, in particular, has even predicted a rally to $27 despite the ongoing market downturn. Related Reading: Crypto Pundit Reignites $100 XRP Price Target, What You Should Know The idea that XRP could eventually reach double and triple-digit valuations continues to attract investor interest, but this projection depends on market conditions and broader adoption trends. In the meantime, holders are struggling, without much success, to prevent a decline. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.16, down by 7.04% in the past 24 hours. The onus now is on whether the price can hold above $2. Even if it breaks below this level, it only opens up the possibility of an accumulation range between $1.6 to $1.5.

The network is dwindling downward, having posted a major loss in the last month due to a range of market factors as well as a technical glitch. And Ripple’s woes don’t end there. The network is facing stiff competition from a new rival, Remittix (RTX). This powerful PayFi solution is changing the game for global payments, offering low fees, reduced processing times and a transparent payment model. This forward-thinking design is causing Remittix to gain massive attention in its presale, which has raised more than $13.8 million to date. So who will prevail out of these two PayFi pioneers in 2025? Ripple Ledger Outage Shakes Investor Confidence In February, the Ripple ledger experienced an unexpected outage, which halted block production for more than an hour. Though the consensus mechanism appeared functional, validations were not being published, causing the network to drift apart. Fortunately, no assets were lost during this incident, but the event definitely had an impact on Ripple investor confidence. The asset has seen a steep 9.45% loss in the last month and an even steeper 18.2% dip in the last week, casting doubt over Ripple’s trajectory. Though Ripple made some impressive updates in 2024, such as with the integration of smart contracts on the XRP ledger and the successful launch of RLUSD, this outage marks a poor start to 2025. Remittix Changes The Game For Global Payments Remittix (RTX) is quickly securing its status as a market disruptor in the PayFi space. The platform has a core mission to streamline the conversion of cryptocurrencies into fiat currencies, allowing users to send funds directly to bank accounts across the globe. Remittix’s standout feature is its advanced PayFi protocol. This advanced piece of kit facilitates instant crypto-to-fiat conversions on more than 40 cryptocurrencies. These crypto assets are converted to FIAT when they are received, without the typical delays and fees that we have come to expect from legacy exchanges. Take a freelancer in India who gets paid in Bitcoin for working for clients in America. They can receive Bitcoin and have it converted into FIAT immediately, which they can then cash out for Indian Rupees to pay their bills and rent. For businesses, Remittix offers a plug-and-play API, enabling them to accept cryptocurrency payments while automatically converting them into fiat. This solution is helping businesses to sidestep the issues that come with crypto acceptance, such as dealing with market volatility. In addition, the integration process is extremely straightforward for merchants, broadening the adoption of digital currencies in everyday transactions.​ With a fixed supply of 1.5 billion RTX tokens, Remittix presents a scarcity factor that could drive value appreciation as adoption grows. Analysts are taking note of Remittix’s potential with some predicting significant price increases as the platform gains traction in the payments industry.​ Investors Snap Up RTX Tokens In Presale Investors are racing to the Remittix presale to secure their share of RTX tokens. Analysts have predicted an explosive 800% price rise during the presale with more growth expected post-launch. For any proactive investor looking to ride the crypto wave in 2025, this project is not one to gloss over.

As a result of President Trump refusing to predict whether his tariff policies could lead to a recession today, major U.S. stock indexes sank. The Nasdaq Composite slumped more than 3% after proving last week that its retreat from December’s record high was a correction. The S&P 500 slid 2%, down and about 8% from its all-time high. Today, a key economic adviser to President Donald Trump has voiced the probable stance of POTUS. He pushed back against claims that uncertainty about his administration’s tariff policies could cause a recession. This came as a survey of American households showed that people were becoming less optimistic about their futures, and U.S. stocks continued to fall. Kevin Hassett, who is in charge of the National Economic Council, said that there were many reasons to be optimistic about the U.S. economy, even though some people think the GDP will drop in the first quarter and there are worries about inflation. This is to say Trump is still in denial. However, many people insist that a recession is possible. In fact, former White House comms director Anthony Scaramucci isn’t holding back. He says Trump’s tariff policies could drag the U.S. into a recession. Wall Street experts take on the current market situation and recession Trump was seen as the market’s savior, promising lower taxes and less stringent regulation. Now, his actions represent the harbinger of doom. The R-word is back on everyone’s lips as people ponder if trade tariffs will backfire and lead to recession rather than U.S. economic prosperity. Dan Coatsworth, an investment analyst, said: “The U.S. market sell-off is starting to look ugly. Many people have been worried about elevated valuations among U.S. equities for some time and are looking for the catalyst for a market correction. A combination of concerns about a trade war, geopolitical tensions, and an uncertain economic outlook could be that catalyst.” He added, “During his first term as U.S. president, Donald Trump often cited a rising stock market as being representative of his success. As such, he will not want to see a full-blown market crash months into his second term.” True to this he had to postpone the Mexico and Canada tariffs. Clearly, he too can see the tariff formula has failed to work a second time. According to Ross Mayfield, InvestmentStrategist, “The Trump administration seems a little more accepting of the idea that they’re OK with the market falling, and they’re potentially even OK with a recession in order to exact their broader goals. He added, “I think that’s a big wake-up call for Wall Street. There had been a sense that President Trump kind of measured his success on stock market performance, there was even somewhat of a ‘Trump put’ so to speak, and I think we’re seeing that’s not the case, so the market is starting to reflect that reality.” It is no surprise. According to Chris Zaccarelli, the company’s chief investment manager, the NASDAQ has been risk-off all year. Today doesn’t add anything new to what we’ve seen over the last few weeks, but it does keep seeing the same things. Therefore, that’s just the bad combo of very high values at the beginning of the year and then more uncertainty. Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist, said: “What he’s trying to enact is structural change… And every time you have structural change you’re going to have uncertainty and you’re going to have friction. It’s understandable people are starting to be a little concerned and starting to take profits.” He advised, “Also, we’ve had this age of U.S. exceptionalism where the U.S. has massively outperformed… that’s also part of the backdrop that you could go invest in other places of the world with much lower multiples and maybe at least not be exposed to the expensive valuations of the U.S. while the U.S. pushes its structural shift.” In the same light, Idanna Appio, Portfolio Manager, says that the pressure on U.S. assets in general shows that people are less sure about U.S. policy. It’s hard for businesses to make decisions when they don’t know how or where to spend. This kind of uncertainty is bad for business in general. There is something to fix the uncertainty, according to Thomas Hayes, head of Great Hill Capital. He said that Japanese government bond yields are a better indicator of what’s happening in the U.S. market than tariffs. All that hot money was in Mag 7 during the carry trade, which is ending.

The price is now consolidating and might struggle to clear the $2.10 resistance zone. XRP price started a fresh decline from the $2.250 resistance zone. The price is now trading below $2.20 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.06 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might continue to move up if it clears the $2.10 resistance zone. XRP Price Dips Further XRP price started a fresh decline after it failed to clear the $2.250 zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price declined below the $2.10 and $2.050 support levels. The bears even pushed the price below $2.00. A low was formed at $1.90 and the price is now attempting to recover. There was a move above the $1.950 and $1.980 resistance levels. The price surpassed the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.260 swing high to the $1.90 low. The price is now trading below $2.20 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.060 level. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.06 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The first major resistance is near the $2.080 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.260 swing high to the $1.90 low. The next resistance is $2.120. A clear move above the $2.120 resistance might send the price toward the $2.1750 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.20 resistance or even $2.250 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.450. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.080 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1.950 level. The next major support is near the $1.90 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $1.850 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $1.80 support. The next major support sits near the $1.750 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $1.950 and $1.900.

As meme coins lose popularity, traders are now turning toward blockchain projects with real utility and long-term value. One such emerging powerhouse is Rollblock – a GameFi revolution that combines DeFi, online gaming, and high-yield staking rewards. With over $10.8 million raised and a fast-growing user base, Rollblock is proving why real-world application matters more than hype in 2025. Rollblock (RBLK) Emerges as Ultimate Meme Coin Killer with Real Utility and Staking Rewards Rollblock is a premier GameFi project based on Ethereum that merges DeFi and online gaming in a unique way. With blockchain-powered security and lightning-fast withdrawals, Rollblock is bringing trust and transparency back to the $500 billion gaming market. The platform has already raised over $10.8 million during its presale, and the native RBLK token has witnessed a massive 610% demand-induced price surge in record time. Rollblock’s gaming ecosystem offers over 7,000 AI-powered titles, including classics like roulette and blockchain-exclusives like Zeppelin. The platform also has live dealer modes where players can recreate the thrill of a Vegas night out through AI-enhanced experiences. If that wasn’t enough, then Rollblock recently launched a sports prediction league on its ecosystem as well. This latest addition allows players to place high stakes bets on top sporting events worldwide as they watch the live stream and engage with other community members. To ensure fairness, Rollblock encrypts every wager on-chain and promises a tamper-proof betting experience. The platform is also fully licensed and regulated by the Anjouan E-gaming Authority, adding another layer of security to the GameFi ecosystem. Beyond this crypto-powered gaming experience, Rollblock investors can also lock their RBLK for a predefined period to secure staking rewards with up to 30% APY. These rewards are funded through Rollblock’s revenue sharing mechanism which uses up top 30% of the platform’s weekly revenue to repurchase RBLK on the open market. Of these, 40% are used as staking rewards while the remaining 60% are permanently burned to increase scarcity. The lucrative model gives users an ongoing passive income without sacrificing user confidence. Analysts note that Rollblock’s low market cap and unique blend of entertainment and utility could outshine meme coins in 2025, making now the ideal time to accumulate RBLK for a low price of just $0.061. Chainlink (LINK) Prepares for Rebound as On-chain Metrics Suggest Accumulation Chainlink’s price action has remained somewhat bearish during the past week, recording a total of 17.59% weekly losses . Despite this sluggish growth, Chainlink’s on-chain indicators suggest strong accumulation behind the scenes. One key metric supporting this outlook is Chainlink’s mean coin age which suggests that LINK tokens are being held for increasingly longer periods. Additionally, Chainlink’s Market Value to Realized Value ratio at -26.29% suggests that Chainlink is due for a strong rebound in March. Chainlink is currently selling for $13.59 following an intraday decrease of 5.38%. Since Chainlink has held a strong support at the $13 level, buyers may push the price toward the nearest resistance at $17.45 in the coming days. Pepe (PEPE) Shows Signs of Sell-off After Compromised X Account Pepe has been trending downward ever since it reached an all-time high of $0.00002825 in December 2024. In recent days, Pepe stagnated as it reached a low of $0.00000627 on March 4. Although the token has made a slight recovery since then, Pepe is still fluctuating within a tight range between $0.00000627 and $0.00000736. Last week, Pepe issued an official warning that its X account has been hacked . Since this development raised concerns about phishing scams and fraud among investors, Pepe is now witnessing a sell-off by retail investors . Pepe is currently selling for $0.00000626 following an intraday increase of 2.63%. Despite this minor uptick, Pepe is still trading below all of its Exponential Moving Averages which confirms the strong downward pressure. Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) Recent Market Activity Fails to Trigger Rally Shiba Inu has witnessed a notable transaction volume of 3.7 trillion tokens over the past week, indicating a sudden spike in SHIB’s network activity. This surge comes at a time when Shiba Inu recorded 9.92% weekly losses and continues to trend downward. Since Shiba Inu’s short-term moving averages are still pushing the token lower, the price chart clearly displays a bearish trend. Despite the significant market activity, there is not enough buying pressure to trigger a recovery for Shiba Inu. Shiba Inu is currently selling for $0.00001237 following an intraday increase of 2.92%. If Shiba Inu fails to maintain the $0.0000125 support level, the meme coin could face an increased risk of downside in the coming days. The Best Memecoins are Fading, But Rollblock is Just Getting Started While the best memecoins struggle with volatility, Rollblock is setting a new standard with blockchain transparency, on-chain gaming, and a lucrative staking ecosystem. As RBLK’s presale enters its final stages, early investors are betting big on its potential to dominate the GameFi sector. With its innovative revenue-sharing model and massive adoption potential, Rollblock is emerging as the ultimate meme coin killer—offering not just entertainment but real earnings for its community.

The price plunged hard and hit the bottom at $76,000. While the bears continue to offer strong upward pressure, bulls seem to be struggling to elevate the levels back above $80,000. This suggests that the retail traders have temporarily exited the market while the institutions and the whales are trying hard to keep the levels inflated. Since the start of the year, multiple events have occurred that favored the crypto space. Trump’s inauguration, his plans to make America the Bitcoin capital of the world, SEC dropping lawsuits & investigations, Trump’s buying more and more cryptos, and importantly, the creation of a Bitcoin Statergic Reserve. Despite all these, the BTC price failed to reclaim $100K and dropped more than 20% from the consolidated zone around $96,600. What’s Causing the Downfall? Historically, the stock markets and the crypto markets have been inversely correlated. The stock market crash has always benefited cryptos. Now, when the Nasdaq witnessed its worst drop since 2022, wiping out over $1.7 trillion from the market, Bitcoin & cryptos are dumping too. This suggests the institutions now hold a major stake over the markets, which may not be good for healthy crypto markets. The drop in the spot and the future market volume substantiate the claim. Will the BTC price Continue to Drop? Has the Bear Market Officially Begun? On the other hand, other cryptos like XRP, Cardano, & Solana are demonstrating strength while Ethereum closely follows Bitcoin’s footsteps. This suggests that the other popular altcoins remain stable, hinting towards a correction rather than the start of a bear market. Meanwhile, the traders have become bearish on Bitcoin as cumulative shorts continue to accumulate, but this may not impact the other tokens or the entire markets. On the other hand, Mt.Gox has yet again moved BTC worth over $900 million to various platforms, which is expected to add to the selling pressure. However, President Trump is set to sign executive orders overturning Biden’s crypto banking restrictions. In the times when accumulation remains relatively low, it could be interesting to watch in which direction the markets may flow in the coming days as uncertainty is rising to its peak.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|TRADING|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-11 05:15:38

Gramegna cautioned that the US crypto pivot “could eventually reignite foreign and US tech giants’ plans to launch mass payment solutions based on dollar-denominated stablecoin,” adding, “And if this were to be successful, it could affect the euro area’s monetary sovereignty and financial stability.” The ESM “supports the ECB’s urgency in making the digital euro a reality to safeguard Europe’s strategic autonomy — this digital euro is today more necessary than ever,” he added. The ESM is an intergovernmental organization established by member states of the euro area, helping countries overcome financial crises and maintain long-term financial stability and prosperity. Pierre Gramegna speaking on US crypto threat. Source: YouTube “Policy developments in other jurisdictions can have important consequences for us here in Europe,” concurred Irish finance minister Paschal Donohoe. “These discussions are fundamentally linked to our own autonomy and to the resilience of our currency,” he added, stating that a European central bank digital currency (CBDC) was now critical to staying ahead of the curve. In February, the European Central Bank said it was expanding the development of its CBDC payment system to settle transactions between institutions. The ECB has been exploring CBDCs since 2020, including a consumer-facing retail digital euro and wholesale cross-border settlement between central banks. Meanwhile, Trump has spoken out against a Federal Reserve CBDC, signing an executive order in January to establish a crypto working group while prohibiting the “establishment, issuance, circulation, and use” of a US CBDC. Related: Crypto academics slam controversial ECB paper blasting Bitcoin The ECB has also rejected the idea of adding Bitcoin ( BTC ) to its monetary reserves or allowing other European central banks to do so. In late January, ECB President Christine Lagarde said that the reserves of central banks have to be “liquid, secure and safe,” implying that they would not include crypto assets. She added that she was “confident” that Bitcoin would not enter the reserves of banks under the European Council.

In the wake of Donald Trump’s return to the White House, speculation has emerged that the administration may be influencing market conditions to push for lower interest rates. At the same time, the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector has seen a sharp decline, wiping out gains made since Trump’s election, with Ethereum and Solana among the hardest hit. Is Trump Engineering a Market Meltdown to Force Powell’s Hand on Interest Rates? The financial markets have been thrown into turmoil amid growing speculation that the Trump administration may be strategically engineering uncertainty to pressure Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell into cutting interest rates. According to Bitcoin advocate and market commentator Anthony Pompliano, President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent could be deliberately stoking market volatility to force Powell’s hand. Their goal, Pompliano suggests, is to lower borrowing costs ahead of the US government’s refinancing of approximately $7 trillion in debt over the next few months. Pompliano’s theory, shared in a March 10 post on X, suggests that Trump’s recent moves—including implementing tariffs and making strong public statements against high interest rates—are part of a broader strategy to create market instability. By doing so, the administration may be trying to build pressure on Powell to cut rates, which would ease borrowing costs and make it cheaper for the US government to manage its growing debt obligations. “The Trump administration is crashing asset prices in an attempt to force Jerome Powell to cut interest rates,” said Pompliano, who serves as the founder and CEO of Professional Capital Management and host of The Pomp Podcast. His argument centers on the decline in the 10-year Treasury yield , which has fallen from nearly 4.8% in January to 4.21% now. The drop suggests that investors are anticipating looser monetary policy in the near future, which would align with Trump’s broader economic vision. The apparent standoff between Trump and Powell dates back to the president’s first term, when he frequently criticized the Federal Reserve for maintaining high interest rates. Now, with Trump back in the White House, the pressure campaign appears to be escalating. In late January, Powell reaffirmed that the Fed would not lower interest rates from their current target range of 4.25% to 4.50%, despite Trump’s public demands for cuts. This has fueled speculation that the White House is using other means—such as market turbulence—to make rate cuts inevitable. Recent stock market sell-offs lend credibility to this theory. Broad market indexes suffered significant losses on March 10, with the S&P 500 index fund (SPY) falling 2.66% and the Nasdaq-100 plummeting 3.8%. Over the past month, the S&P 500 is down 7.32%, while the Nasdaq-100 has shed 10.7%. The cryptocurrency market has fared even worse. Bitcoin (BTC) has plunged 27.4% from its record high of $108,786, bringing its current price to $79,726. Since Dec. 17, over $1.2 trillion in market capitalization has evaporated from the crypto sector. The continued downturn, Pompliano argues, could eventually reach a breaking point where the Federal Reserve is left with no choice but to cut rates. Trump himself has not explicitly confirmed such a strategy, but his recent remarks indicate that he sees high interest rates as a significant economic impediment. “Nobody ever gets rich when the interest rates are high because people can’t borrow money,” Trump said in a March 9 Fox News interview. Pompliano believes this statement reinforces the idea that Trump’s ultimate objective is to drive interest rates lower—whether through direct influence over the Fed or through economic disruption that makes cuts unavoidable. “The big goal is to get interest rates down, and that will lead to more economic activity thanks to access to cheap capital,” he added. “Give the people cheap capital, and they’ll go and do things with it.” Will Powell Blink? Market Expectations Are Split The Federal Reserve’s next meeting on March 19 is unlikely to result in a rate cut. According to CME FedWatch, a tool that tracks market expectations for Fed rate decisions, there is a 96% probability that the central bank will maintain its current policy. However, the outlook for the following meeting on May 7 is much less certain. Market expectations suggest nearly a 50-50 chance that Powell and his colleagues could decide to lower rates. Historically, the Federal Reserve has been reluctant to cut rates when inflation remains a concern, as one of its primary objectives is to maintain price stability. Lowering rates too soon could risk reigniting inflationary pressures, something Powell has repeatedly warned against. But if Trump’s suspected strategy succeeds in triggering a recession—or at least a severe enough downturn—then the Fed may have little choice but to ease monetary policy to stabilize the economy. This scenario, which some analysts have labeled a “Trumpcession,” could play out if market instability worsens in the coming months. The theory that Trump is intentionally crashing markets to gain leverage over Powell remains speculative. However, the unfolding events suggest a calculated effort to influence the Federal Reserve’s decision-making process. Whether this strategy will ultimately work remains uncertain. Powell and the Fed have so far resisted political pressure, maintaining that their policy decisions are guided by economic fundamentals rather than political influence. But with markets on edge, the coming weeks could prove to be a crucial test of who blinks first—Trump or Powell. Regardless of the outcome, the current financial turmoil underscores the delicate balance between monetary policy, political influence, and economic stability. Investors should brace for continued volatility as the battle over interest rates intensifies. DeFi Market Wipes Out Trump-Era Gains as Ethereum Struggles Amid Market Uncertainty In other news, the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector has seen a dramatic reversal in fortunes, wiping out all the gains it accumulated since Donald Trump was elected US president in November 2024. After reaching a peak of $138 billion in total value locked (TVL) on Dec. 17, DeFi’s TVL has since plummeted to $92.6 billion by March 10, marking a steep decline that sheds light on the sector’s ongoing challenges. Crypto analyst Miles Deutscher was among those who highlighted this trend, pointing to a combination of market factors driving the downturn. While the entire DeFi sector has suffered, Ethereum and Solana have been particularly hard hit. Solana, which saw a meteoric rise in popularity due to meme coins and low-cost transactions, has struggled to maintain its traction. The fading appeal of Solana’s meme coins has contributed to its TVL decline, leading to concerns about its long-term growth. Ethereum, the backbone of DeFi, has also faced significant hurdles. Despite Bitcoin reaching an all-time high of $109,000 on Jan. 20—the day of Trump’s inauguration—Ethereum’s price has failed to revisit its previous high of $4,787 from November 2021. Instead, ETH has remained underwhelming, with its TVL shrinking by $30.6 billion from cycle highs, according to DefiLlama data. Despite positive developments, such as the launch of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US and Trump’s executive order for a strategic Bitcoin reserve, Ethereum has been unable to capitalize on the broader market momentum. One of the most notable trends in recent weeks has been Ethereum’s massive net exchange outflows. According to IntoTheBlock data, approximately 800,000 ETH—worth about $1.8 billion—was withdrawn from exchanges in the week starting March 3. This marks the highest seven-day net outflow since December 2022. Typically, when large amounts of a cryptocurrency leave exchanges, it signals a long-term holding strategy or movement into DeFi applications like staking or yield farming. However, this recent outflow coincided with a 10% drop in Ether’s price, which fell as low as $2,007 during the period. This is an unusual dynamic, as exchange outflows generally occur when prices are rising rather than falling. “Despite ongoing pessimism around Ether prices, this trend suggests many holders see current levels as a strategic buying opportunity,” IntoTheBlock stated in a March 10 post on X. Before March 3, Ethereum had experienced net exchange inflows daily, indicating that investors were actively selling during the market downturn. According to Juan Pellicer, senior research analyst at IntoTheBlock, Ether’s dip to $2,100 may have triggered accumulation, prompting investors to withdraw their holdings from exchanges for long-term storage or staking. Ethereum’s Pectra Upgrade Encounters Challenges Amid these market shifts, Ethereum developers continue working on major upgrades aimed at improving the network’s efficiency and usability. The upcoming Pectra upgrade seeks to address some of the network’s long-standing issues, particularly liquidity fragmentation caused by Ethereum’s rollup-centric roadmap. By doubling the number of blobs in transactions, Pectra aims to lower gas fees and improve layer-2 interoperability. Additionally, account abstraction improvements will make smart contract wallets more seamless across Ethereum and layer-2 networks, enhancing bridging and fund management. However, the rollout has encountered its own set of challenges. On March 5, the Pectra upgrade launched on Ethereum’s Sepolia testnet, but it quickly ran into issues. Ethereum developer Marius van der Wijden reported that Geth nodes were experiencing errors, and empty blocks were being mined due to a deposit contract triggering an incorrect event type. A fix has since been deployed, but the setback highlights the technical hurdles that still exist in Ethereum’s evolution. The decline in DeFi TVL signals broader concerns about the industry’s resilience. While macroeconomic conditions and regulatory uncertainty have played a role, the downturn also raises questions about the sustainability of DeFi’s explosive growth in previous cycles. Ethereum’s struggles to reach new highs, even in the face of positive catalysts like ETFs and network upgrades, suggest that DeFi still faces an uphill battle in regaining investor confidence. Additionally, the market shift toward Bitcoin—evidenced by its all-time high earlier this year—suggests that many investors are prioritizing stability over riskier DeFi investments. With nearly $50 billion in DeFi TVL wiped out since December, the industry will need to adapt to a changing landscape. Whether the Pectra upgrade and continued Ethereum development can reinvigorate DeFi remains to be seen, but for now, the sector is grappling with one of its most significant downturns in recent history.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|ETH|FIAT|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-11 05:30:00

Over the past week, Bitcoin has declined by 14.6%, with its price dropping an additional 4.4% in the last 24 hours. As of today, Bitcoin is trading at $79,766, pushing it nearly 27% below its ATH. Amid this price performance, CryptoQuant analyst ibrahimcosar has closely examined Bitcoin’s price movements, focusing on the CME gap phenomenon, which has historically played a role in Bitcoin’s short-term fluctuations. Related Reading: Crypto Pundit Dumps Bitcoin Holdings Sub-$100,000, Lists Reasons Why It’s Time To Short What To Expect From Bitcoin Based On CME Gap In his latest analysis, Ibrahim highlighted how BTC opened at $82,110 on the CME, creating a gap up to the $86K level. According to him, this price gap could provide clues about Bitcoin’s next move, potentially leading to a short-term attempt at reclaiming $86K–$90K in the coming days. The CME gap refers to the difference between BTC’s closing price on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) before the weekend and its opening price after the weekend. These gaps often get filled as BTC’s price moves back to the levels where the trading pause occurred. Ibrahim notes that Bitcoin previously formed a $10,000 gap on February 28, which was quickly filled within 19 hours. Now, with BTC currently trading around $79K–$80K, the analyst suggests that another gap has formed above the current price range, indicating that Bitcoin may attempt to fill the $86K–$90K region within the next one to two days. However, he cautions that this does not necessarily signal a full reversal in BTC’s downtrend. Instead, he maintains that Bitcoin’s broader trend remains uncertain, and its price action through March and early April will be key in determining whether a stronger recovery is on the horizon. Key Support Levels and Market Sentiment Another market analyst, ShayanBTC, has pointed to $83,000 as a critical support level, based on Bitcoin’s interaction with the Realized Price of 3-6 Month UTXOs. This metric tracks the average acquisition price of mid-term holders and has historically acted as a significant support or resistance zone. Shayan disclosed that BTC recently tested this level, and holding above it could signal strong investor confidence, potentially reinforcing bullish sentiment. However, Bitcoin’s decline below $80,000 suggests that this $83,000 support level has already been breached. If Bitcoin fails to regain ground above this threshold, market sentiment could shift towards fear, leading to increased selling pressure from mid-term holders. In this scenario, BTC could enter a distribution phase, where short to mid-term investors sell their holdings, further driving the price downward. Ibrahim has identified the $78,000–$80,000 region as the next key support zone, which may determine BTC’s near-term trajectory.

The Remittix token has obtained more than $13.8 million by selling over 517 million tokens for a price of $0.0734 each and experts believe it represents a major profit opportunity. XRP 2.0 and Remittix: A New Payment Contender XRP 2.0 has become a popular nickname assigned to Remittix due to its similarities in addressing market requirements that Ripple’s original payment token controlled. XRP established itself in cross-border finance through affordable speedy payment transactions. Remittix continues the journey it started by reaching consumers through various payment solutions with cut-rate prices and swift transaction speeds. Many experts predict Remittix will surpass all projections made about Ripple. The $13.8 million+ in presale funding demonstrates that crypto investors want to see tokens that connect payment methods between traditional currencies and regular cryptocurrency transactions. The phrase XRP 2.0 points to more than just fast payments. Remittix sets itself the challenge to eliminate the issues digital assets face due to lengthy crypto-to-fiat swaps and regulatory obstacles and complicated user experiences. The integration of practical solutions in the Remittix system places the digital currency in position to replace previous payment tokens and become the standard for fast digital payouts. Different market watchers predict that the token will expand like major successful coins as long as it maintains its business partnerships and alliance development. How Remittix Tackles Real-World Problems The increased attention on XRP 2.0 stems from Remittix’s ability to address meaningful demands of consumers and businesses. Numerous coins promote advanced features yet they do not necessarily provide straightforward access for everyday users. The Remittix system prioritizes PayFi which includes speedy transactions between digital currency and regular money systems at low transaction costs. Remittix avoids complicated smart contract systems by concentrating on payment network connection. The system allows shoppers and freelancers to transform their tokens into local currency using an approach which minimizes user inconvenience. The market’s rejection of speculative tokens leads to this practical approach being introduced. The market desires altcoins which provide everyday convenience.

Market analysts believe that the correction is not over yet and BTC could crash further all the way under $70,000 before resuming the uptrend. Amid heavy selloff on Wall street, crypto market has extended losses this week, with altcoins facing an even greater crash during this period. Bitcoin Price Can Correct All The Way to $69,000 Renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez has outlined critical price levels for Bitcoin, suggesting the importance of maintaining current support of $80,000. He said that as long BTC holds this support levels, the bullish momentum will remain intact. However, he warned that a dip below this level could open the door to a further Bitcoin price decline , with $69,000 emerging as the next significant support level. Source: Ali Martinez BTC Recovery Depends on Macro Factors Former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes has also shared a similar outlook on the Bitcoin price trajectory, while urging investors to maintain patience amid the current volatility. Hayes projects Bitcoin’s bottom around $70,000, a 36% correction from its all-time high of $110,000—“very normal for a bull market,” he stated. He emphasized that the recovery depends on several macroeconomic factors. Arthur Hayes wrote : “We need stock indices like $SPX and $NDX to free fall, a TradFi player to collapse, and central banks like the Fed, PBOC, ECB, and BOJ to ease monetary policies to ‘make their country great again’”. Additionally, Hayes also advised investors to undertake a cautious approach and not fall for “buy the dip” narrative. “Wait for central banks to ease before deploying more capital. You might not catch the bottom, but you’ll avoid prolonged sideways movement and unrealized losses,” he added. Considering the historical trends of the previous bull runs of 2017 and 2021, the average Bitcoin price correction was between 35-37%. So far in this cycle, BTC has corrected 25%, which shows further room on the downside if the trend repeats. BTC Panic Selling to Continue? Blockchain analytics platform Santiment reported that there’s a massive level of fear at the moment with investors expecting the Bitcoin price to sink under $70,000. Commeting on Bitcoin’s capitulation phase, Santiment noted that the optimal buying opportunity will arise when social media sentiment shifts predominantly bearish. Source: Santiment On the other hand, the outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs have remained consistent averging around $300 million daily, for the last three days. This shows that BTC institutional interest has been waning severely. On the other hand, XRP has outpaced BTC in weekly inflows over the past few weeks. Despite this, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood remains confident that current economic trends could lead to a deflationary boom.

She believes this situation will offer more policy flexibility for both a potential Trump administration and the Powell-led Federal Reserve than investors currently expect. According to Wood, this extra flexibility could help drive the U.S. economy into a “deflationary boom” in the second half of the year, potentially leading to lower prices and an overall improvement in economic conditions. March 11, 2025 05:54:09 UTC Why is Crypto Market Down Today? The crypto market is under significant pressure, with the total market cap dropping by $57 billion in the past 24 hours to $2.55 trillion amid concerns over the US economy. Bitcoin led the decline, falling to an intraday low of $76,600, while altcoin FET plunged 15%. The downturn coincides with news that President Trump will reverse Biden-era crypto debanking regulations, and the SEC is pulling back on its proposal to expand oversight of crypto exchanges.

SBF has launched a series of high-profile campaigns, including an unauthorized appearance on the Tucker Carlson Show, which reportedly led to him being put in solitary confinement. However, political insiders believe that his chances of receiving a pardon are extremely low, given the current political climate and the ongoing controversies surrounding his case.

Bitcoin has slipped below $80K, while Ethereum trades near its 2022 bear market lows. Meanwhile, tokens like $OM, $IP, and $MOVE are holding strong amid the downturn. Overall, the crypto market cap stands at $2.74 trillion, with BTC dominance at 58.10% and the Fear & Greed Index at 24, signaling extreme fear among investors.

XRP will 10X minimum. ALTS will 10x-50X. STAY STEADY and FOCUSED!” This statement reflects a strong confidence in the potential growth of Bitcoin, XRP, and alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins). Bitcoin’s Prospective New All-Time High Egrag Crypto’s assertion that “Bitcoin will reach new ATH” suggests an anticipation of Bitcoin surpassing its previous all-time high. While specific figures were not provided in this statement, historical patterns and market analyses often serve as the basis for such projections. \The performance of Bitcoin is frequently viewed as an indicator of the broader cryptocurrency market, influencing investor sentiment and the valuation of other digital assets. XRP’s Potential for Significant Growth The prediction that “XRP will 10X minimum” indicates an expectation that XRP could increase in value by at least ten times its current price. This aligns with previous analyses conducted by Egrag Crypto. As reported by Times Tabloid , the analyst identified key price targets for XRP, including $9.7 and $27, based on historical market cycles and technical analysis. These targets were derived from patterns observed during previous bull runs, suggesting that similar conditions could lead to substantial price appreciation for XRP. https://twitter.com/TimesTabloid1/status/1680250907504656385 Altcoins’ Expected Surge The statement further predicts that “#ALTS will 10x-50x,” implying that alternative cryptocurrencies could experience growth ranging from ten to fifty times their current valuations. This broad projection reflects the high volatility and potential for rapid appreciation inherent in many altcoins. Investors often seek substantial returns in this market, though such opportunities are accompanied by increased risk. Community Response and Regulatory Considerations Egrag Crypto’s optimistic outlook has garnered attention within the cryptocurrency community. A user identified as SpectraON commented : “Xrp will be the winner. Many countries are watching closely to see when the SEC will drop the case.” This remark highlights the ongoing legal proceedings involving Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) . The outcome of this case is considered a significant factor that could influence XRP’s future valuation and adoption. Regulatory clarity is often critical in the broader acceptance and integration of cryptocurrencies into traditional financial systems. Egrag Crypto’s recent projections underscore a bullish sentiment within the cryptocurrency market, particularly concerning Bitcoin, XRP, and altcoins. While these predictions are grounded in historical analyses and technical patterns, it is essential to approach such forecasts with caution.

Bullish Divergence Spotted on Daily Chart! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP, Ripple Labs’ native token, is in a crucial make-or-break situation due to bearish market sentiment and a recent price decline. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that XRP has lost over 6% of its value in the past 24 hours and is currently at a critical support level of $1.95. XRP Technical Analysis and Its Key Levels However, the XRP daily chart shows signs of price recovery and now appears to be rebounding. According to expert technical analysis, XRP’s daily chart is witnessing a bullish divergence, indicating a potential price recovery. Source: Trading View In the chart, while the asset’s price is making a lower low, XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) has formed a higher high, suggesting that the asset is poised for a price recovery and an upside rally. Based on recent price action and historical momentum, if XRP holds above the $1.95 level, there is a strong possibility that it could soar by 40% to reach $2.95 in the coming days. Despite a notable price decline in recent days, the asset still holds above the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA), indicating that it is in an uptrend.

He is now asking Trump for a pardon after his crypto exchange FTX collapsed, leading to a 25-year prison sentence. SBF’s High Profile Efforts To Seek Pardon Now, Bankman-Fried is trying to turn things around by asking former President Trump for a pardon. His efforts include making high-profile appearances on conservative media outlets, including an unsanctioned spot on “The Tucker Carlson Show”, which got him placed in solitary confinement. While Carlson didn’t directly ask about a pardon, he showed interest in some Republican ideas, sparking rumors in the community about a Trump pardon after the interview aired. After the interview, Polymarket prediction platform, reported that the chances of a Sam Bankman-Fried pardon nearly doubled. According to The New York Times, he’s consulting with a lawyer close to Trump and his father even wrote an opinion piece in favor of Trump’s plans for a sovereign wealth fund. Insiders Doubtful Over His Chances However, despite the efforts, insiders are doubtful about his chances. One anonymous crypto lobbyist said his chances of getting a pardon are “zero,” adding, “Sorry, it’s Trump world… near zero.” The idea of Bankman-Fried getting a pardon isn’t impossible. Trump has previously supported crypto and pardoned Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht, a figure popular in the crypto world. However, Ulbricht had a strong following in the crypto community, while Bankman-Fried is disliked, especially after causing the FTX collapse and the resulting crypto downturn. SBF’s family, including his parents Joe Bankman and Barbara Fried, are consulting with a lawyer connected to Trump’s past campaigns to help secure a pardon. Although they haven’t contacted Trump directly, they hope his transactional approach to clemency will work in their favor. However, the clemency effort has not gained much momentum. On the other side, a crypto lobbyist told Fortune that Bankman-Fried’s chances might be increasing due to Trump’s growing ties with the industry and his willingness to grant pardons. However, the lobbyist pointed out that the wider crypto community hasn’t prioritized Bankman-Fried’s case, so a pardon still seems unlikely.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-11 05:45:52

Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President took the oath of office for his second term. The crypto market has experienced heightened selling pressure during the past eight weeks amid the mixed fundamentals, especially from the political environment. Despite the Trump administration announcing the strategic Bitcoin and crypto reserve , which was highly anticipated, the ongoing tariff trade wars have changed the entire market dynamics. Consequently, on-chain data shows institutional investors have dramatically reduced their appetite for crypto assets, led by the U.S. spot BTC ETFs which have lost over $4.3 billion in the past two months. Bitcoin Price Expectations Today After dropping more than 14 percent last week, Bitcoin (BTC) price has been retesting a crucial support level of around $78k in the past two days. In the two-hour timeframe, BTC price has been forming a potential bearish continuation pattern, with the next target around $73.7k. According to Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, Bitcoin price will likely continue in bearish sentiment until major global central banks – led by the Fed, PBOC, ECB, and BoJ – kickstarts quantitative easing (QE) to stir up growth in their respective economies. The plan: Be fucking patient. $BTC likely bottoms around $70k. 36% correction from $110k ATH, v normal for a bull market. Then we need stonks, $SPX and $NDX to enter free fall. Then we need TradFi muppet to go under. THEN we get Fed, PBOC, ECB, and BOJ all easing to make… — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) March 11, 2025 Ethereum Price Prediction The Ethereum (ETH) market has led the wider altcoin industry in bearish sentiment in the recent past. The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $225 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of about $41 billion, closed last week below a crucial support range between $2.1k and $2.2k. As a result, it is safe to assume that the Ethereum sellers have the higher ground over the buyers. In the past 24 hours, Ether’s price retested the rising trendline of a regular chart of the weekly timeframe. However, a consistent close below $1,760 will trigger a heavy selloff in the coming weeks for Ether. According to crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen , Ethereum price will likely bottom out after the Fed ends the prolonged Quantitative Tightening (QT). XRP Price Prediction Ripple Labs’ XRP price has been forming a potential reversal pattern since early December 2024, characterized by a head and shoulders (H&S) formation coupled with a bearish divergence of the weekly Relative Strength Index. In the past few days, the XRP price has been retesting a crucial support level around $2, which coincides with the possible neckline of the H&S pattern. If the XRP buyers fail to defend the current support level, a major selloff towards $1.5, which coincides with the 0.618 weekly Fibonacci Retracement , will be inevitable. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The overall crypto market has faced resistance, with the meme coin sector seeing a sharp downturn. The total market cap for meme coins currently stands at $51.1 billion, down 8.9% in the last 24 hours, while the AI meme coin market cap has dropped by 7.3% in the same period. Despite these challenges, MIND of Pepe continues to attract regular investments, securing up to $100,000 per day in presale funding. One key factor behind this sustained momentum is MIND of Pepe’s unique approach, blending artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. The project promises upcoming AI-powered innovations, setting it apart from traditional meme coins that rely solely on hype and speculation. Currently, MIND tokens are priced at $0.003816 , with prices expected to increase through subsequent presale rounds. As momentum builds, investors are closely watching how MIND of Pepe will evolve in the AI-meme coin space. How MIND of Pepe Aims to Redefine the Meme Coin Sector Most meme coins rely on community-driven hype, lacking real-world functionality. However, MIND of Pepe is taking a different approach by integrating AI-driven technology into its ecosystem. The project’s upcoming AI agent is expected to autonomously interact with blockchain networks, analyze on-chain activity, and provide real-time insights for traders and investors. https://twitter.com/MINDofPepe/status/1898134450158104871 The team behind MIND of Pepe has outlined plans to develop a self-evolving AI system that will monitor market sentiment, decentralized applications (dApps), and social media trends. This AI-powered analysis could give users an edge in identifying potential market movements before they happen. Additionally, MIND of Pepe is exploring hive-mind analysis, a method that processes vast amounts of data to detect sentiment shifts in the crypto market. Another standout feature in the project’s roadmap is an AI-powered token-creation mechanism. Over time, the AI system is expected to autonomously generate new tokens that reflect market sentiment and emerging trends, creating an evolving ecosystem that adapts to real-world conditions. With these planned innovations, MIND of Pepe aims to break away from traditional meme coin limitations, positioning itself as a forward-thinking AI-meme hybrid. Earn High Staking Yield With MIND Tokens Beyond its upcoming AI-driven capabilities, MIND of Pepe is already offering one of the most attractive staking programs in the crypto space. Currently, the staking APY (annual percentage yield) stands at 315%, allowing holders to earn substantial rewards while maintaining their position in the ecosystem. So far, out of the total 100 billion token supply, more than 1.1 billion MIND tokens have been staked, demonstrating strong community confidence in the project’s long-term potential. As more investors stake their tokens, the circulating supply of MIND will continue to decrease, potentially driving scarcity and demand. However, as the staking pool grows, the APY is expected to decline gradually, making early participation more rewarding. For those looking for long-term exposure to the AI-meme coin sector, MIND of Pepe’s staking incentives offer an added layer of value, making it a compelling option for passive income seekers. Why Crypto Analysts Are Closely Watching MIND MIND of Pepe’s strong presale performance and AI integration have caught the attention of crypto analysts and influencers, many of whom see it as a project with long-term growth potential. One such influencer, crypto YouTuber ClayBro, who has over 138,000 subscribers, recently covered MIND of Pepe’s potential to disrupt the AI crypto space. AI Agents And Meme Coins Are Set For Explosive Rebound! Mind Of Pepe Combines The Best Of Both! In his latest video, crypto analyst ClayBro provided insights into the current state of the meme coin market, highlighting key factors that could shape investment decisions in the coming months. Despite the recent downturn across the sector, he pointed out that the search volume for both meme coins and AI Agent tokens is at an all-time high – a clear indication that investor interest remains strong despite short-term price fluctuations. However, ClayBro also acknowledged a concerning factor, as the Crypto Fear and Greed Index currently sits at 17, signaling an ‘Extreme Fear’ level. This suggests that market sentiment is deeply cautious, which often results in heightened volatility and hesitant buying behavior. That being said, he emphasized that meme coins have continued to perform well over the medium term, even after experiencing temporary corrections. Given this pattern, he believes that the current dip could present a strategic buying opportunity for investors looking to enter the market at a lower price point. ClayBro sees MIND of Pepe as a particularly interesting option for those seeking diversification within the meme coin space. Since MIND tokens are currently available at a fixed price via presale, it could present a potential entry point ahead of future exchange listings. How to Get Involved in the MIND Presale The MIND of Pepe presale is still ongoing, offering investors the chance to acquire tokens at an early-stage price of $0.003816 before prices rise in future rounds. Investors can participate in the presale through the official MIND of Pepe presale website, with payment options including Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), Tether (USDT), and Credit Cards. For added convenience, the token is also available via the Best Wallet app , which can be downloaded from Google Play and Apple App Store , providing an easy way to purchase, manage, and track MIND holdings. With exchange listings expected post-presale, MIND has the potential for significant long-term gains, possibly even reaching 100x returns if market conditions align favorably. However, as with all meme coins, high volatility remains a factor, and price predictions are never guaranteed. For investors interested in AI-driven meme coins, MIND of Pepe represents an intriguing opportunity to get involved in a project that is blending cutting-edge technology with blockchain innovation.

GOP Senator Bill Hagerty, one of the bill’s co-sponsors, said on March 10 that he introduced an update of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, which would go to a Banking Committee vote on March 13. He added that the updated bill saw bipartisan consultation. The bill is co-sponsored by Republican Senators Cynthia Lummis and Tim Scott, who is also chair of the Banking Committee chair, along with Democrats Kirsten Gillibrand and Angela Alsobrooks. “The updated version of the GENIUS Act makes significant improvements to a number of important provisions, including consumer protections, authorized stablecoin issuers, risk mitigation, state pathways, insolvency, transparency, and more,” Gillibrand said in a statement. Hagerty first introduced the bill in early February. It aims to bring issuers of US dollar stablecoins with market caps over $10 billion — currently only Tether ( USDT ) and Circle’s USDC ( USDC ) — under Federal Reserve regulations . Those under $10 billion could opt into state-level regulation. Web3 learning app EasyA co-founder Dom Kwok said on X that the latest version of the GENIUS Act, shared by FOX Business reporter Eleanor Terrett, gives “US-issued stablecoins a competitive advantage.” He added that the bill now holds foreign stablecoin issuers to “extra high standards” in areas such as reserve and liquidity requirements, money laundering checks and sanctions checks. Source: Dom Kwok “Most foreign issuers will find these standards hard to meet,” which gives Circle’s USDC and Ripple Labs’ Ripple USD (RLUSD) “an upper hand,” he said. Related: Crypto needs policy change more than Bitcoin reserve — Execs Crypto lawyer and Hogan & Hogan partner Jeremy Hogan came to the same conclusion in a separate X post, saying the bill’s requirements, particularly around reserves and Anti-Money Laundering checks, “all fall neatly for RLSUD and USDC.” The GENIUS Act still has a way to go before becoming law. The Senate Banking Committee will have to vote to pass the bill and it will then be put to a full Senate floor vote where it could be debated. If it passes the Senate, it will head to the House. If the House doesn’t change the bill, then it will be sent to President Donald Trump to sign into law or veto.

This shift in market dynamics seems to be scary, revealing the excess dominance of the institutions over the markets. In the meantime, the token that once was called a ‘centralized token’ is now displaying disparity from the top two tokens. The XRP price remains still above a crucial barrier wherein a rebound could elevate the levels back above $2.8; otherwise, a major pullback seems to be imminent. Ever since President Trump officially approved the creation of a Bitcoin strategic reserve, the demand for an XRP reserve has also spiked. Besides, the speculation of the token becoming a U.S. reserve asset is also making huge noise, which may have kept the price above the bearish range. However, the token continues to trade around a crucial range while the bulls are utilizing all their energy to keep up the price above the barrier. Will the XRP price drop below $2 & reach $1.5 or rebound to rise above $2.5? As seen in the above chart, the XRP price has reached the neckline of a head and shoulder pattern. This suggests the rise of the bearish dominance against the bulls, as the supertrend has turned bearish regardless of the recent rebounds. On the other hand, the RSI has displayed a bullish divergence but remains below the descending trend line. Therefore, the XRP price is feared to break below the support to squeeze out all the selling pressure, as the bears have been constantly trying to drag the price below $2 since December 2024. Regardless of the price plunge, the XRP price remains under bullish influence as the market sentiment remains bullish. The token is the third largest crypto, which has been heavily benefited from Trump’s victory. After Hedera & Mantra, XRP has surged over 336%, leaving behind the other popular tokens. Now that the price is strongly holding support above $2, it suggests the trader’s sentiments to remain bullish regardless of the bearish pressure escalating over the markets. Hence, the XRP price is believed to consolidate for a while, followed by a bullish breakout above $2.5.",Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|MARKET|FIAT|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-11 05:54:06

Presales allow investors to buy tokens before they hit major exchanges, often at the lowest possible prices. With the right picks, early buyers can position themselves for high returns as these projects gain traction. Among the top crypto presales this month, BlockchainFX , Solaxy, and Frog Knox stand out as some of the most promising investments. BlockchainFX – The Multi-Asset Trading Revolution BlockchainFX ($BFX) is more than just another crypto exchange. It is the first-ever trading super app that allows users to seamlessly swap between crypto, stocks, forex, ETFs, and commodities without needing multiple platforms. This breakthrough in multi-asset trading could redefine how investors interact with financial markets. One of the standout features of BlockchainFX is its 70% revenue-sharing model, which redistributes trading fees back to its users. Rather than simply paying transaction fees, traders earn passive income in BFX and USDT just by using the platform. Additionally, BlockchainFX is introducing a high-limit BFX credit card, allowing users to spend their holdings at over 250 million merchants worldwide with up to $100,000 per transaction. With its presale currently live, BlockchainFX offers early investors the chance to acquire BFX tokens before mainstream adoption. Given its ability to bridge crypto and traditional finance, this could be one of the most significant crypto launches of 2025. Solaxy – The Future of Decentralized Energy Solaxy ($SLX) is tackling one of the biggest challenges in energy: decentralized, sustainable power solutions. Using blockchain technology, Solaxy enables users to invest in and profit from renewable energy projects worldwide. By tokenizing energy production, SLX holders gain fractional ownership of solar, wind, and hydroelectric power plants, earning dividends from the electricity they generate. As governments and corporations ramp up their commitment to clean energy, Solaxy is positioned to become a leading player in the green crypto movement. Investors looking for long-term sustainability projects with real-world utility should keep an eye on Solaxy’s presale. Frog Knox – The Next Big Meme Coin with Real Utility The meme coin space has seen explosive growth, but Frog Knox ($FNX) is taking things a step further by adding real utility to its ecosystem. While the project embraces the humor and viral appeal of meme culture, it also integrates DeFi staking, NFT rewards, and a play-to-earn gaming ecosystem to provide holders with real incentives beyond speculation.

Cybersecurity group SpyoSecure said in a March 10 post to X that hacker group Dark Storm made a Telegram post taking credit for the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, which was posted by the group’s leader. “To anyone wondering why X (Twitter) was down, it was under attack by Dark Storm Team,” SpyoSecure said. Source: SpyoSecure The Telegram channel has since been deleted for violating the platform’s terms of service. Screenshots shared on X show them stating they “took Twitter offline,” alongside a screenshot of failed connection attempts from various global locations. Ed Krassenstein, a social media personality and co-founder of NFT marketplace NFTz.me, said in a March 10 post to X that he had also been investigating the attack and was in touch with Dark Storm’s leader, who again claimed they were behind it. “The reason he gives me for the attack is just a demonstration of our strength, with no political motives,” Krassenstein said. The Russian-backed pro-Palestinian hacker group Dark Storm has been active since 2023 and is known for targeting NATO countries. Platform owner Elon Musk confirmed the social media platform had been hit with a cyberattack preventing some users from accessing the site on March 10. He said in a March 10 interview with Fox Business’s Larry Kudlow he had a rough idea of where the IP address of the hackers originated. “We’re not sure exactly what happened but there was a massive cyberattack to try and bring down the X system with IP addresses originating in the Ukraine area.” Related: US Treasury sued for giving Elon Musk’s DOGE access to sensitive info It comes amid violence at Tesla facilities around the US as part of a broader “Take down Tesla” movement protesting Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which is taking the axe to many government departments. Musk told Kudlow that regardless of the protests, he still thinks they are “doing the right thing here” because DOGE is cutting spending to initiatives “very few taxpayers would agree make sense.” Tesla stock is also suffering. In the most recent trading session, Tesla is down over 15% to $222 per share. In the after-hours session, it’s down a further 3% to $215, according to Google Finance.

As a result, some people in the industry believe the government should prioritize clear crypto regulation over a Bitcoin reserve. Meanwhile, Michael Saylor’s Strategy is aggressively expanding its Bitcoin holdings by raising up to $21 billion for additional acquisitions. In Singapore, SGX is set to launch Bitcoin perpetual futures in 2025 to further integrate cryptocurrency into traditional finance. US Needs Policy Reform More Than a Bitcoin Reserve Donald Trump’s recent executive order establishing a national Bitcoin reserve left the cryptocurrency industry with mixed reactions. While some had high hopes for the initiative, several executives believe that regulatory clarity is a far more pressing issue for the sector. Many in the industry are still awaiting concrete guidelines on securities regulation, taxation, and stablecoins, and uncertainty continues to weigh on the market. The executive order was signed on March 6, and it fulfilled Trump’s campaign promise to create a Bitcoin reserve for the United States. However, instead of actively purchasing Bitcoin, the reserve will be made up of digital assets that were seized by law enforcement. This approach disappointed traders and investors, as it does very little to address the regulatory ambiguity that has plagued the industry for a long time. Max Giammario , CEO of Web3 artificial intelligence startup Kindred, shared his concerns over the lack of a clear roadmap for innovation, taxation, and institutional adoption, as markets need structured guidance rather than vague rhetoric. Bitcoin’s price action over the past week (Source: CoinMarketCap ) In the aftermath of the announcement, Bitcoin’s price dropped by roughly 13%, with altcoins suffering similar declines. The broader cryptocurrency market lost over $400 million in capitalization. Without immediate regulatory clarity, these losses could extend even further. Alvin Kan , Bitget Wallet’s chief operating officer, suggested that unless policies on stablecoins, ETFs, and institutional adoption become clearer, Bitcoin may continue to dominate the market at the expense of altcoins. Despite these concerns, there is still optimism in the industry. Trump maintained a pro-crypto stance, and his administration has appointed leaders who are considered favorable to digital assets. Some executives believe that these developments could lead to more constructive policies in the long run. Theodore Agranat , director of Web3 at Gunzilla Games, pointed out that the direction of US crypto policy under Trump is still a bit uncertain, but with key figures in influential positions, ongoing positive initiatives could emerge. For now, there is cautious optimism that future developments could provide the necessary framework to support long-term growth in the crypto sector. Strategy Ramps Up Bitcoin Accumulation While the US government will not actively buy Bitcoin for its reserve, the same cannot be said for Strategy. Michael Saylor’s Strategy is the largest public corporate Bitcoin holder, and is preparing to raise up to $21 billion in fresh capital to expand its Bitcoin reserves. The company announced on March 10 that it entered a new sales agreement that allows it to issue and sell shares of its 8% Series A perpetual strike preferred stock. The funds raised will be used for general corporate purposes, including potential Bitcoin acquisitions. Under the new agreement, which is dubbed the “ATM Program,” Strategy plans to sell shares in a disciplined manner over an extended period, taking into account market conditions, including the trading price and volume of the perpetual strike preferred stock. The company stated in its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that the proceeds from this initiative will be directed towards working capital and additional Bitcoin purchases. Strategy Bitcoin stats (Source: Strategy.com ) As of now, Strategy holds about 499,096 BTC, which is valued at approximately $41.2 billion. The firm acquired these holdings at an aggregate purchase price of $33.1 billion, with an average cost of $66,423 per Bitcoin. This aligns with its previously disclosed plans to raise up to $21 billion in equity and $21 billion in fixed-income securities over the next three years under its “21/21 plan” to accumulate even more Bitcoin. Since the beginning of 2025, Strategy publicly announced six Bitcoin acquisitions, and added about 52,696 BTC to its reserves since Jan. 13. This contributed to the company’s current BTC yield of 6.9% year-to-date. The firm also set an ambitious BTC yield target of 15% for 2025, after achieving an impressive 74% yield in 2024. The BTC yield metric reflects the percentage change in the ratio between the company’s Bitcoin holdings and its assumed diluted shares. Overall, the company has become one of the most influential players in the crypto sector since adopting its Bitcoin reserve strategy in August of 2020. This move paved the way for greater institutional Bitcoin adoption, and even inspired other firms like Tesla and Japan’s Metaplanet to follow suit. SGX to Launch Bitcoin Perpetual Futures in 2025 Singapore Exchange (SGX), which is the largest exchange group in Singapore, is preparing to introduce Bitcoin perpetual futures in the second half of 2025. The exchange wants to expand institutional market access by offering cryptocurrency futures that are tailored specifically for professional and institutional investors. A spokesperson from SGX stated that the company seeks to provide a trusted trading alternative, leveraging its Aa2 rating by Moody’s to establish credibility in the crypto derivatives market. Singapore Exchange HQ The launch of these Bitcoin perpetual futures is pending approval from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), with strict limitations in place to prevent retail investors from participating. Unlike traditional Bitcoin futures contracts, which require settlement at a predetermined date, perpetual futures offer continuous trading without an expiration date, making them a popular tool for traders looking to speculate on Bitcoin’s price movements. The introduction of perpetual Bitcoin futures on SGX coincides with Singapore’s growing influence in the cryptocurrency and blockchain sector. The MAS actively fostered a crypto-friendly regulatory environment, which led to a big increase in the number of licensed crypto firms in the country. This trend positioned Singapore as a leading global hub for digital asset trading and investment. SGX is not alone in its push for crypto futures trading in the region. In January of 2025, EDX Markets, a crypto asset firm backed by Citadel Securities, also announced its plans to offer crypto futures in Singapore. Meanwhile, in Japan, the Osaka Dojima Exchange is looking for regulatory approval to list Bitcoin futures, which, if granted, could make it one of the first traditional exchanges in Asia to handle these products. As institutional interest in cryptocurrency derivatives continues to rise, futures trading is becoming an increasingly popular trend in the industry. SGX’s entry into this space is a major step toward integrating Bitcoin into traditional financial markets in Asia.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|ASIA|FIAT|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-11 06:11:15

Solana weekly decentralized application (DApp) revenue has also slumped around 86% from $238 million in mid-January to $32 million for the past week. Meanwhile, DeFi total value locked on Solana has also declined by almost 50% over the same period, falling from a January high of just over $12 billion to current levels of around $6.4 billion.

Memecoin mania peaked when Donald Trump launched his own namesake token (TRUMP) on Jan. 18, shortly followed by his wife, Melania, who launched MELANIA on Jan. 20. “The launch of TRUMP and MELANIA marked the top for memecoins as it sucked liquidity and attention out of all the other cryptocurrencies,” said CoinGecko founder Bobby Ong on March 6. Both tokens surged following their launches but dumped in the days that followed. TRUMP is currently down 86% from its peak, trading at $10.50, while MELANIA has collapsed 95% in just seven weeks to $0.71.

There could be a causation here, as, for decades, the low-yielding yen propped up global asset prices. The ongoing rise in the Japanese yen may have had a hand in the recent risk aversion on Wall Street and in the crypto market. That said, the bullish positioning in the Japanese yen looks overstretched, with speculators holding record longs last week, according to the CFTC data tracked by MacroMicro . Such extreme bullish positioning, representing a collective belief in a continued move higher in the asset, sets the stage for disappointment, following, which a mass unwinding of longs unfolds, leading to a quick bearish reversal. In other words, the yen's rise could stall for now, offering relief to risk assets, including Nasdaq and bitcoin. ""We are now cautious on chasing further JPY strength, given stretched speculative positioning as well as strong dip-buying appetite from the domestic community,"" Morgan Stanley's G10 FX Strategy team said in a note to clients late Friday. Strategists explained that many Japanese investors use the Nippon Individual Savings Account (NISA) scheme to snap up foreign assets during risk-off, inadvertently slowing the pace of JPY appreciation. Additionally, the public pension system tends to go against the trend, rebalancing out of JPY assets. ""Indeed, such scenario happened in last August after a sharp appreciation of the JPY and the pronounced sell-off in equities,"" strategists noted. Let's see if history repeats itself, triggering a renewed risk-on sentiment for Nasdaq and bitcoin. The USD/JPY pair turned up following the July and early August slide to 140, eventually rising to 158.50 by January. BTC turned up as well from the early August crash to $50,000, rising to new record highs above $108,000 in January. At press time, bitcoin traded near $80,300, representing a month-to-date decline of nearly 5%, extending February's 17.6% slide. At one point early Tuesday, prices dipped to $76,800, according to CoinDesk data. Meanwhile, USD/JPY traded at 147.23, having put in a five-month low of 145.53 early Tuesday, TradingView data show. Temporary respite? While the stretched bull positioning and institutional flows suggest relief ahead, these factors may do little to alter the broader bullish outlook for JPY, which is backed by a narrowing U.S.-Japanese bond yield differential. So, risk asset bulls need to be vigilant for signs of volatility in the yen and the broader financial markets. The chart shows the spread between yields on the 10-year U.S. and Japanese government bonds. The spread has narrowed to 2.68% in a JPY-positive manner, reaching the lowest since August 2022. Plus, it has dived out of a macro uptrend, suggesting a major bullish shift in the JPY outlook.",Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|Nasdaq,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|FIAT|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-11 07:20:47

On-chain whale data signaled that a whopping 195,000 coins were sacked from crypto exchange giants as SOL price slammed around $120. As an upshot, bullish market sentiments orbiting the sixth-largest coin by market cap surfaced among traders and investors, with a potential $150 target next. Solana Whale’s Trade Move Stirs Market Optimism According to Lookonchain data on March 11, a Solana whale withdrew 195,000 coins from crypto exchange behemoths recently. Per the whale data, $23.2 million worth of coins were bought from top CEXs Bybit, OKX, and Gateio in the past 24 hours. This massive accumulation by a large-scale trader amid an ongoing market slump reflected strong confidence in the asset’s potential ahead. As a result, broader market sentiments reflect optimism about the asset’s long-term price prospects. Solana Whale’s ‘Buy-The-Dip’ Plan Notably, the broader crypto market currently faces immense pressure due to macro fears. Soon after Donald Trump’s new tariff saga, the chances of a recession in the U.S. rose to 40%. In turn, risk assets encountered a panic-stricken investor sentiment globally. Bitcoin price lost $80K, even touching a $76K multi-month low this Tuesday. Altcoins, including SOL, mirrored the broader slumping trajectory. However, the Solana whale’s decision to capitalize on the dip indicated a ‘buy-the-dip’ strategy, setting off optimistic waves among investors as it signals a recovery lies ahead. Rising Staking Fuels More Optimism Simultaneously, an X post by Onchain Lens on March 11 revealed that ‘Cumberland DRW’ staked 48,182 SOL, worth $5.72 million, recently. Coupled with the massive SOL whale accumulation, this data garners additional optimism, underscoring reduced token supply on exchanges.

The general belief is that US President Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump is an American former president politician, businessman, and media personality, who served as the 45th president of the U.S. between 2017 to 2021. Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President decision to impose tariffs against China, Canada and Mexico has played a prominent role in the sudden collapse of these markets. A series of posts published by The Kobeissi Letter suggests that there exists another strong reason for the collapse of these markets. Read on for more details! Markets Have Lost $5.5 Trillion in Two Months On January 10, the total market cap of the crypto market was around $3.23T. On the same day, the S&P 500 index was at $5,828.54. Since then, the crypto market has slipped by at least 20.12%, and the S&P 500 by around 3.67%. As per The Kobeissi Letter, over the last 2 months, the S&P 500 and crypto have lost a combined $5.5 trillion of market cap. Since February 20 alone, the S&P 500 has lost $4.5 trillion in market cap. On February 20, the S&P market was at $6,133.58. Since then, the market has plummeted by approximately 8.46%. During the same period, the crypto market has slipped by no fewer than 18.86%. Trade War Is Just a Scapegoat According to The Kobeissi Letter, the markets were already aware about the possibility for the occurrence of a trade war. The recent shift in market sentiment has played a crucial role in the collapse of the markets. As of now, the Crypto Fear $ Greed Index stands at 24. On the same day, a year before, the index was at 82. On November 22, 2024, it touched a peak of 94. On the first day of 2025, the index was at 66. On February 27, it dropped as low as 10.

So far, this level has held well and managed to keep sellers at bay. Nevertheless, the momentum remains bearish with lower highs and lower lows. This could end up putting pressure on the key support again soon. Chart by TradingView 2. Sellers Dominate When Trump made its first announcement about the US Crypto Strategic Reserve, ADA shot up above $1 on the news that it will be included in such a reserve. However, since then, the price corrected in full and returned to it’s pre-pump levels. This indicates that the rally was just a temporary market speculation without long-term demand. Chart by TradingView 3. Weekly MACD Remains Bearish On the weekly MACD, nothing has changed for Cardano since the bearish cross from late January. Even the tweet from Trump did not change the current downtrend. This only shows that a reversal is still quite some distance away.

The S&P 500 also erased $1.4 trillion in market cap, marking its worst trading day since 2022. The widespread crash across risk assets was triggered by fears of a looming recession, with experts predicting a 40% chance that the US economy might enter a recession this year. Cryptocurrencies Price Prediction as US Recession Fears Spark Market Crash Investors are turning away from risk assets such as cryptocurrencies and stocks due to economic uncertainty. Yesterday, the S&P 500 market cap dropped by $1.4 trillion, marking its worst day of trading in two years. This index is now approaching a six-month low. Cryptocurrencies also saw a similar decline that caused $954M in total liquidations after Bitcoin price fell to $76,000 and Ethereum price fell to $1,800 for the first time since November 2023. Most top altcoins are also trading at multi-month lows. Crypto Liquidations This downtrend was triggered by the fear of a looming recession after predictions market Kalshi showed that the chances of a US recession have climbed to 40%. Because of these fears, traders are de-risking from risk assets like crypto and stocks and turning towards assets such as gold, which recently reached an all-time high. Chances of a US Recession Trump Fuels US Recession Rumors The markets also grew anxious after President Donald Trump failed to rule out the likelihood that the US economy could enter a recession in 2025. In an interview with Fox Business , Trump admitted that his economic policies, such as economic tariffs, would cause short-term turbulence. He stated, “There is a period of transition because what we’re doing is very big… We’re going to have a disruption, but we’re okay with that.” Last week, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell noted that despite the ongoing economic uncertainty, the US economy was still in a good place . Therefore, the Fed was not in a rush to trim interest rates to stimulate economic growth and avert a recession. “If the economy remains strong but inflation does not continue to move sustainably toward 2 percent, we can maintain policy restraint for longer,” Powell said. What’s Next For Cryptocurrencies? There is a mixed market sentiment on whether cryptocurrencies will recover after the recent crash. Analyst Ali Charts noted that after Bitcoin price fell below its 200-day moving average, the next key support level lies at $66,000. Without any bullish catalyst, and with recession fears still at play, BTC price could drop gradually until it hits this support. Bitcoin Mayer Multiple As Bitcoin price moves down, other cryptocurrencies are set to also decline. However, ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood noted that the recent downtrend was the crypto market discounting the final phases of a rolling recession. After this phase, the crypto market will experience a deflationary boom in the second half of 2025. As the market sentiment remains uncertain, Bitcoin price may face challenges holding the $80K support level. Ethereum could also accelerate its decline after hitting 2023 lows. This highlights a bearish price prediction for most cryptocurrencies.

Weekly network revenue on Solana hit an all-time high of $55.3 million in mid-January, driven by a boom in meme coin minting. However, that momentum has collapsed, with revenue plunging 93% to just $4 million last week—its lowest level since September, according to DeFiLlama data . Solana’s decentralized application (DApp) revenue has also taken a significant hit, dropping 86% from $238 million in January to $32 million last week. Solana’s DeFi TVL Sinks Nearly 50%, Dropping from $12B to $6.4B Meanwhile, total value locked (TVL) in Solana’s DeFi ecosystem has been cut nearly in half, falling from $12 billion to approximately $6.4 billion over the same period. The decline coincides with a sharp drop in meme coin trading activity, which accounted for 80% of Solana’s revenue, according to a March 5 report by VanEck. The Pump.fun trading platform, which fueled much of Solana’s memecoin craze, saw its daily revenue peak at $15 million in late January before plummeting 95% to $800,000 on March 7, per Dune Analytics data. The peak of the memecoin mania occurred in mid-January when Donald Trump launched his own token (TRUMP) on Jan. 18, followed shortly by Melania Trump’s MELANIA token on Jan. 20. The initial surge in interest pulled liquidity away from other cryptocurrencies, marking the high point of the memecoin frenzy, according to CoinGecko founder Bobby Ong. Since then, both tokens have collapsed. $TRUMP has plunged 86% from its peak, now trading at $10.50, while $MELANIA has lost 95% of its value, dropping to $0.71 in just seven weeks. The overall memecoin market cap has also suffered, falling 68% from a December high of $137 billion to just $44 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. The downturn has also impacted Solana’s price, which has fallen 58% from its mid-January all-time high of $293. The cryptocurrency dropped another 5% on the day, trading at $122 at the time of writing. Solana Community Debates Proposal to Overhaul SOL Tokenomics The Solana community is actively discussing a governance proposal , Solana Improvement Document (SIMD)-0228, which seeks to revamp the network’s tokenomics by introducing a dynamic, market-driven inflation model for SOL tokens. The proposal, authored by Multicoin Capital’s Tushar Jain and Vishal Kankani, along with Max Resnick, lead economist at Anza, aims to replace Solana’s fixed inflation schedule with a system that adjusts token emissions based on staking participation. Currently, Solana follows a fixed inflation schedule, starting at 4.6% annually and decreasing by 15% each year until stabilizing at 1.5%. It is worth noting that investment firms are moving swiftly with their Solana ETFs. Investment giant Franklin Templeton recently filed a registration for the Franklin Solana Trust in Delaware. The filing follows similar applications from Canary Capital and Grayscale, both of which have already been acknowledged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). VanEck was the first to propose a Solana ETF in June 2024 , prompting a series of filings from major asset managers.

If successful, this cryptocurrency could see a nice relief rally that could take it towards $1.8 next. Chart by TradingView 3. Momentum Turning Bullish On the 4h MACD, we can clearly see that momentum is about to flip bullish. This may soon encourage buyers to return and attempt a clean break above $1.5.

The ESM and ECB have teamed up to fast-track the rollout of a digital euro. The price of euro has crashed massively, dropping approximately 50% of its value since its launch. The European Union is becoming increasingly uneasy over U.S. President Donald Trump’s strong backing of digital assets, especially dollar-backed stablecoins. European finance officials worry this shift could undermine the euro’s monetary sovereignty and disrupt financial stability, particularly as the EU struggles with a weakening currency. Europe’s Response to Growing Crypto Threat Pierre Gramegna, Managing Director of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), expressed these concerns at a Eurogroup press conference on March 10. He noted the U.S. government’s supportive stance toward cryptocurrencies and stablecoins might allow American tech giants to build dominant payment systems in Europe. “ If this were to be successful, it could affect the euro area’s monetary sovereignty and financial stability, ” Gramegna warned, reiterating the EU’s urgency in launching the digital eur… The post EU’s Concern of Trump’s Pro-Crypto Policies To Undermine Euro Stability appeared first on Coin Edition .",Market|Market News|News|Donald Trump|Europe,EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coin Edition', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/7/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinquora,2025-03-11 07:30:00

Such forecasts are not speculation, they stem from Mutuum Finance’s strong fundamentals, innovative use case, and growing investor demand. Mutuum Finance is also gaining more popularity as it is now progressing with its phase 2 across its ongoing presale program. The presale funding has already surpassed $2.7 million and the number of holders has already risen to 4,900. Aside from phase 2, it is also now over 75% sold out during high demand. Investors can purchase MUTM tokens at $0.015 since the subsequent price wave surge will push their value to $0.02. Investors purchasing Phase 2 will get 300% ROI from the launch price, where MUTM is set at $0.06. The project will reach an estimated value of $5. Mutuum Finance Presale Investors converge on Mutuum Finance because of its revolutionary decentralized finance (DeFi) lending solution based on decentralization that powers advanced financial services. The Mutuum Finance project displays strong growth by obtaining $2.7 million valuable funding from investors while gathering more than 4,900 participants to its financing scheme. Phase 2 tokens currently sell for $0.015, but investors must purchase during this period, as they should anticipate a 33.33% price increase that will finalize the early investment period. Users participating in the presale phase can achieve up to 300% investment gains since the token price will be set at $0.06 after presale completion. Mutuum Finance leads the DeFi sector expansion through its pioneering lending model that establishes a dominant market position. Revolutionizing Crypto Lending with a Dual-Model Approach The platform of Mutuum Finance utilizes P2C (Peer-to-Contract) and P2P (Peer-to-Peer) models through an advanced lending infrastructure to boost asset accessibility from both sides of the network. The P2C model allows users to put stablecoins into smart contract pools to gain passive income, through which platform users immediately access borrowing services. Smart contracts operate automatically to modify interest rates, which provides optimal return rates to lenders with reduced borrowing expenses. Through its P2P model, the system establishes direct lending relationships that exclude intermediaries to achieve full decentralization. Users manage all aspects of their negotiations on the platform to generate a more efficient and clear system, which lets borrowers and lenders personalize their loan terms through an improved user-powered borrowing process. Innovating Crypto Lending with Stability Mutuum Finance generates its stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain where security remains possible because of dollar reserves. Ethereum enables transaction security while maintaining resistance against algorithmic instability issues through its financial system. Mutuum Finance develops a next-generation decentralized finance system by linking robust infrastructure with contemporary lending models. The rapid adoption of DeFi markets motivates Mutuum Finance to provide flexible lending services and take advantage of the current market trends. Users find investment opportunities through Mutuum Finance because of its dedicated customer approach. The crypto lending market is experiencing swift growth which Mutuum Finance leads as one of its main proponents. Analysts are highly optimistic about Mutuum Finance (MUTM) because they forecast its price will reach $5 in 2025, which represents a 33,233% rise against its current value of $0.015. Paid investor demand, combined with strong fundamental strength and DeFi lending model innovation, creates a bullish market prediction. More than 4,900 investors came forward to participate in the presale events, which resulted in exceeding $2.7 million.

Through its AI algorithms Ozak AI delivers optimized trading and data analytical solutions and decentralized platform applications that provide blockchain technology at scale with automatic control. The Ozak AI presale continues to capture investor attention through its promising figures that surpass $900,000 raised from the market. According to market analysts, Ozak AI tokens will reach $1 by 2025, as their current price stands at $0.003. The platform plans to extend its operations to healthcare and finance sectors in addition to logistics, which showcases its flexibility in operations beyond crypto trading. As an organization composed of skilled professionals operating within an innovative technological system Ozak AI seeks leadership status in the upcoming AI blockchain revolution. Market participants invested in the project because of promising return potential, while some analysts predict a 300x growth if the platform delivers its planned objectives successfully. Pi Coin’s Price Decline and Market Challenges Pi Network has lost a substantial amount of value in recent months after its unexpected cryptocurrency startup success. The value of the token reached $1.3340, thus dropping 55% from its peak value of $3 in February. The value of Pi Coin has decreased because token unlocks generate more supply, which leads to price reduction from dilution effects. A total of 100 billion Pi coins exist in circulation at present and the market has 7.22 billion tokens available for trading. This current year will see 188 million token releases, while the total sum of 1.4 billion tokens will enter circulation between 2027 and 2028. The growing supply has worried investors, which leads to an unfavorable forecast regarding token price stability. The cryptocurrency market across the board has caused negative effects on Pi Coin’s performance. While the cryptocurrency market loses value, its total market capitalization drops 3.65% to $2.75 trillion, and Bitcoin encounters downward pressure. The price of Pi Coin faced a decline due to market reactions toward significant political and economic U.S. events as market participants adjusted their portfolios based on industry transformations. Investment Outlook: Ozak AI vs. Pi Coin Potential investors need to evaluate the differences in market performance between Ozak AI and Pi Coin to make informed decisions. The structured AI-driven model of Ozak AI alongside its strategic presale approach, has gained investor attention because people foresee robust growth potential for the platform. Long term investors seeking potential blockchain investments should consider systems that integrate AI functions because the combination makes blockchain attractive. Ozak AI and Pi Coin stand in stark contrast with one another since Pi Coin exhibits high price volatility, and investors need to consider the potential impacts of supply dilution. Future token unlocks may create additional price fluctuations in the cryptocurrency which makes its value riskier. Ozak AI emerges as a favorable cryptocurrency choice among those who want to invest in AI-based blockchain platforms by delivering both a systematic framework and development potential.

Experts believe it can scale up to 1500x the $127.57 billion current XRP marketcap. Currently, RTX is at $0.0734 with over $13.8 million in funds and over 517 million tokens sold. The majority of meme tokens ride the excitement train, but Remittix aims to satisfy real demands by offering quick and affordable cross-border payments. In our next segment, we will see how Remittix did in such a short period of time and whether RTX will be a replacement for XRP in international finance surpassing XRP marketcap in no time. PayFi Advantage: Fast and Affordable Money Transfers Remittix (RTX) stands out among the money transfer services between countries. It is an enormous market valued at trillions of dollars annually. It is no longer necessary to wait for wire transfers or shell out very significant fees. It only takes approximately 24 hours to convert your crypto (such as BTC, ETH or others) to your currency in the area. Say you are a freelancer in Brazil with a customer in Canada; Remittix simplifies the process for the individual to receive a direct bank deposit. This simplicity is among the chief reasons RTX raised over $13.8 million in funding and sold over 518 million tokens. If Remittix can acquire big retail or payroll partners for which it can sell a lot, this will trigger very high price rises up to a multiple of approximately 1500. This will make the token market cap close to the big XRP market cap of $127.57 billion. Why 1500x Can Occur Crypto investors think Remittix (RTX) with its low price and high utility can go up to $1500x in worth. They’re comparing it with XRP, whose worth went up when banks were eager to use its payment technology for cross-border money remittances. RTX promises the same advantage of rapid money transfer between countries only for ordinary individuals like business owners and families, not banks. By locking team tokens in smart contracts, Remittix limits the chances of scams. Since most ordinary people will most likely be using it, the token price can go up much quicker than those with complex enterprise smart contracts or DeFi. While reaching the $127.57 billion market cap may be difficult, fans think the trillion-dollar remittance market can accomplish it with RTX as the go-to choice. RTX Figures for Growth At the center of Remittix (RTX) is a presale valued at over $13.8 million with over 518 million tokens sold. That is significant for a project with real use cases in the real world, as opposed to one with new technology or meme-based projects. Investors believe that when families, freelancers or business owners can see how easy RTX cross-border payments are, money will be sent in increasing exponential numbers quickly. Each new user would create more users in the pursuit of less expensive, faster deposits, a trend that will get the token market cap up to the level of XRP. The project will, however, have to make deals and grow in the right direction in order to reach its full potential for 1500x growth. Many are viewing the locked team tokens and audits as a signal the team is in it for the long term. Conclusion: $0.07 to $127.57 Billion, Is It A Fantasy or A Real Opportunity? Remittix (RTX) may equal or surpass the XRP market cap of $127.57 billion. RTX will benefit individuals in the same manner XRP benefited banks: by providing money transfers faster and at a reduced cost. Currently at $0.0734, it has gathered more than $13.8 million, so Remittix is beginning to make waves with a 1500 times return. How long it will endure in the real world will be the deciding factor on whether it can catch up with XRP marketcap. Ready to Give Remittix (RTX) a Go?

They are also scheduled to testify at a pivotal congressional hearing on Tuesday as political momentum builds for regulatory legislation that could offer a clearer outline of the future of these digital assets. Charles Cascarilla, the chief executive officer of Paxos Inc., one of the largest stablecoin issuers, said in a prepared testimony, “A dollar on the blockchain could be transferred instantaneously, at virtually no cost, and could be held by anyone who had an internet connection and a smartphone.” Critics of the current financial system also point to high-fee services like ATMs, overdrafts, and wire transfer fees, which make it incredibly expensive for low-income individuals. Cascarilla characterized this system as a “regressive tax,” which creates financial disparities. Proponents of stablecoins argue that these digital tokens can eliminate those losses, make transactions cheaper, and open access to millions who do not meet the requirements to be part of the traditional payment system. However, despite their advantages, stablecoins do not offer the same regulatory protections found in traditional banking institutions. Unlike bank deposits, they do not have Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) coverage protection, so consumers could suffer sizable losses if an issuer fails. That concern has sparked speculation that the federal government could ultimately have to step in to clean up after a major stablecoin disaster—possibly at a steep cost to taxpayers. Stablecoin regulation interest is receiving support from both sides of Congress Interest in stablecoin regulation is growing in Congress, with a bipartisan tilt toward new legislation. Even President Donald Trump supports the move. He is positive about efforts to draw regulatory clarity for the industry, such as those at a White House crypto summit earlier this month. The Secretary of the Treasury, Scott Bessent, backed stablecoins and said they could help to ensure the US dollar remains the “dominant” currency in the world economy. Compared to the moves in the broader crypto market, stablecoins have seen a fairly rapid surge for some time. According to ARK Invest , an investment firm led by Cathie Wood, data shows that global transaction volumes crossed $15 trillion in 2024. Most US consumers who rely heavily on cards for a wide range of retail purchases do not inherently use stablecoins. However, they are widely used in digital and cross-border transactions; the evolution of the entire financial ecosystem will continue to become increasingly attractive. Stablecoins promise to be backed one stablecoin-to-one dollar on reserves and serve as a lock-in to the dollar as the world’s No. 1 reserve currency. This has led policymakers to consider how the industry should best be regulated to protect financial stability while supporting innovation. Senate and House of Representatives bills have the common goal of regulating the stablecoin. The issuers in the introduced model would be accountable to federal or state regulators. They would be mandated to hold reserves big enough to cover all the redeemable cryptocurrency for money and to abide by the anti-money laundering regulations and other financial reports. The goal, however, is to pen regulations that protect consumers without inhibiting the industry’s growth. National finance executives like Stripe Chief Executive Patrick Collison and head of digital assets at The Bank of New York Mellon Corp Caroline Butler will also join Charles Cascarilla. All of them will appear in the House Financial Services Committee hearing, which has been reviewing stablecoin bills and has the power to determine the future of digital payments. This uptick in regulatory scrutiny has become more pronounced in part due to the involvement of some of the largest players in the industry, including Tether and Circle, known for managing billions of dollars of transactions daily. Stablecoins may not have taken over brick-and-mortar merchants as the primary payment method for goods and services, with fiat currency still being the most commonly accepted, but online commerce, remittances, and digital asset trading have adopted them greatly. One of the many points of contention in the legislative talks is whether stablecoin issuers would be required to register in the US. Such a mandate may disadvantage offshore issuers, such as El Salvador-based Tether, while helping competitors based on US soil, such as Circle. Policymakers also consider imposing higher capital requirements to ensure that the reserves backing stablecoins remain strong during financial stress. Congress weighs stablecoin regulations amid banking concerns and industry pushback Banks have traditionally held a monopoly over financial transactions, including deposits, loans, and payment settlements. With the emergence of stablecoins, banks feel threatened and have spoken out against them as competition for deposits and payment processing services. If stablecoins capture market share, they might drain revenue from banks dependent on transaction fees and interest-bearing deposits. Another is the lack of a central backstop for stablecoins. If the industry grows large enough to become systemically important, one big failure could ripple through the financial system. Some policymakers have proposed that a central bank digital currency (CBDC) issued by the Federal Reserve would offer a safer alternative to privately issued stablecoins. However, the cryptocurrency industry and its advocates on Capitol Hill have fought the proposal, arguing that a digital dollar supported by the Fed would snuff out competition and destroy innovation. They have introduced a bill that would ban the Federal Reserve from issuing a CBDC. Tethered before the House Financial Services Committee and its Chair Patrick McHenry, the mainstay has focused legislation around stablecoins, notably, the Lummis-Gillibrand legislation , contrasted by bipartisan support from Senators Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) and Bill Hagerty (R-TN). A Senate aide said that the Senate Banking Committee would meet to discuss and vote on legislation covering stablecoins, potentially as soon as Thursday.

The controversy highlights growing dissatisfaction within the developer community, with some arguing that Base is prioritizing hype-driven tokens over serious blockchain innovation. The backlash began when Base publicly endorsed GrokCoin, a new token linked to Elon Musk’s AI chatbot, Grok. The post on X praised the project’s trading mechanisms and AI-driven wallet, which had already generated over $200,000 in fees. However, this move angered many builders who have spent months working on projects without receiving similar recognition from Base. A prominent developer, Kawz , voiced his frustration, claiming that despite dedicating significant effort to his Base-based app, he was never acknowledged by the platform. Meanwhile, GrokCoin, launched by a few individuals with limited details, received immediate attention. His sentiments were echoed by others in the community, who criticized Base’s selective promotion and argued that the platform is alienating talented developers. Another blockchain community member, FloBro , called out Base’s approach, stating that the platform fails to support builders while favoring select projects that cater to speculation rather than technological advancement. He suggested that this strategy is one reason why Base has struggled to create a strong meme coin trend compared to other blockchains. Despite the criticism, some community members defended Base’s promotion of GrokCoin. Shazam, another developer, explained that GrokCoin was not created arbitrarily. The token launch required users to send 5 million BNKR tokens to an AI-controlled wallet, allowing Grok’s algorithm to generate the new coin. He argued that if GrokCoin’s connection to Elon Musk gains traction, it could bring widespread attention to Base and the Ethereum ecosystem. The debate underscores a deeper conflict within the blockchain space: the tension between serious developers working on long-term projects and the hype-driven culture of meme coins and speculative tokens. While some believe that high-profile tokens like GrokCoin can attract attention and new users to the platform, others argue that neglecting established builders risks alienating the very people who contribute to the blockchain’s long-term success. Base’s leadership is now under pressure to clarify its stance on project promotion. The platform’s future credibility may depend on how it balances community engagement, project visibility, and the broader adoption of meaningful blockchain applications.",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-11 07:40:26

Bitcoin continued its downtrend despite MicroStrategy’s new capital raise , while Trump’s policy moves and a recent White House crypto summit failed to boost market sentiment. Despite the downtrend, Altcoin Daily is doubling down on Bitcoin and select altcoins, urging investors to resist market fear, which has dropped to its lowest level. In a recent video, the Altcoin Daily host reminded viewers not to be afraid of the ongoing market crash. According to the analyst, the next 15 to 30 days could be life-changing as strategic accumulation happens behind the scenes. Echoing a similar sentiment, Matt Hougan, the Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, recently expressed strong confidence in the altcoin market, stating that we are entering a “ Golden Age ” for crypto beyond Bitcoin. As the market gains momentum, investors closely watch top altcoins that could lead the charge in this cycle. Analysts warn investors about selling the quality assets and why they think these altcoins will make you a millionaire. Here Are Six Altcoins to Think About During This Dip. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum (ETH) remains the dominant force among altcoins. With Ethereum’s upcoming Dencun upgrade , scalability is expected to improve, benefiting layer-2 solutions . Analysts believe ETH is gearing up for a major rally, especially with staking on the rise. If ETH clears resistance at $3,500, a surge toward $4,000 could be in play. However, the broader market movement remains key to its breakout potential. Solana (SOL) Solana (SOL) is the comeback kid after a turbulent 2023. Solana has regained momentum with increased activity in its DeFi and NFT ecosystem. SOL is trading near a crucial resistance level of $120, and a breakout could see it climb to $150. Analysts highlight strong institutional interest, but network reliability remains a possible concern. XRP XRP remains a focal point due to its ongoing battle with the SEC . While regulatory uncertainty persists, Ripple’s global expansion and banking partnerships keep XRP relevant. A move past $0.80 could trigger a run toward $1, but traders remain cautious about potential regulatory roadblocks. Cardano Cardano (ADA) continues to build with a focus on real-world utility. Its recent smart contracts and DeFi advancements make it an attractive long-term play. A successful breakout above $0.70 could indicate a strong bullish wave . Dogecoin (DOGE) DOGE continues to be a trader’s favorite, with Elon Musk’s influence still playing a role in its volatility. If DOGE can break past $0.10, momentum could drive it toward $0.15. Meme coins remain speculative, but DOGE’s longevity in the market keeps it alive. Avalanche Avalanche (AVAX) has gained traction due to its high-speed transactions and institutional partnerships. With growing adoption in traditional finance, AVAX is positioned well for future growth . AVAX needs to maintain support above $40 to sustain bullish momentum, with analysts setting a target of $50 if the volume picks up. Buy When There’s Blood in the Streets! Right now, the market is deep in the red, but savvy investors see it as a buying opportunity. Many new investors panic-sell during dips, but history shows that those who hold through volatility often see the biggest gains. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

This sudden downturn has affected hundreds of thousands of traders, with long positions suffering the biggest losses. Bitcoin and Ethereum have taken the hardest hits, falling to their lowest levels in months, as investors panic amid worsening market conditions. A significant factor behind the sharp drop is the movement of large amounts of cryptocurrency by major players. Mt. Gox , the once-dominant exchange still settling debts with creditors, transferred tens of thousands of Bitcoin, triggering fears of a broader sell-off. Additionally, an Ethereum whale , inactive for months, deposited a massive amount of ETH into Kraken, further adding to the market turmoil. Another major holder offloaded a large amount of ETH at a significant loss, likely in an attempt to prevent forced liquidation. Adding to the market instability, political uncertainty has also played a role. Comments from Donald Trump about an impending economic downturn have rattled both traditional and crypto markets. His statement about potential ""disruption"" has fueled fears of an approaching recession, which sent shockwaves across the financial sector. As a result, both stock prices and crypto valuations tumbled, erasing the gains made following the latest U.S. monetary policy update. Bitcoin's steep decline has sparked concerns that further losses could be ahead. The leading cryptocurrency briefly touched a multi-month low before slightly recovering, but analysts warn that unless buying pressure returns, the trend may continue downward. Ethereum has also been hit hard, plunging to its lowest point since late 2023, marking a sharp reversal from its previous upward momentum. Crypto traders have been caught off guard by the rapid liquidations. Many had placed bullish bets expecting the market to continue its rally, only to be wiped out as prices dropped. The current situation highlights the risk of overleveraged positions in highly volatile markets. As prices fell, cascading liquidations further fueled the downward spiral, forcing traders to exit their positions at a loss. Meanwhile, whales and institutional players continue to move large sums of digital assets, suggesting uncertainty about the market’s near-term direction. Transfers worth hundreds of millions of dollars have been tracked, showing that major investors may be adjusting their portfolios in response to the volatility. While some view these moves as normal market activity, others fear they indicate further declines ahead. Despite the turmoil, some traders see an opportunity. Historically, large corrections have been followed by strong recoveries, and long-term investors may take advantage of the lower prices. However, the market remains highly unpredictable, with external factors such as regulatory developments and macroeconomic conditions playing a crucial role in shaping future trends. For now, the crypto space remains on edge, with traders watching closely to see if prices stabilize or if another wave of sell-offs will push valuations even lower. The coming days will be crucial in determining whether this is just a temporary correction or the start of a prolonged downturn.",,EN,0,0,MARKET|ETH|BUSINESS|BTC|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-11 07:43:52

A glimmer of hope has emerged as lawyer Fred Rispoli unveiled a crucial date that marks a significant turning point for the XRP lawsuit settlement. The lawyer asserts that the lawsuit will witness a major development before this critical deadline. Lawyer Unveils XRP Lawsuit’s Crucial Deadline: Know More In a recent X post , legal expert Fred Rispoli shared insights on the potential resolution of the XRP lawsuit. According to Rispoli, the Ripple vs SEC case may finally reach its conclusion or witness significant progress before Ripple’s appellate brief submission on April 16, 2025. As Rispoli pointed out, while there is no official requirement or timeline dictating this outcome, it’s reasonable to expect some movement in the XRP lawsuit before this crucial date. Bringing a sense of hope to XRP enthusiasts, Rispoli wrote on X, “Let’s keep an eye on it…and hope.” XRP Lawsuit Resolution in April: Uncertainty Remains Despite Fred Rispoli’s statement, the community remains doubtful about the conclusion of the Ripple lawsuit. While experts, including Jeremy Hogan and MetaLawMan, have predicted a potential delay in the settlement, the April deadline still hangs in balance. Despite rumors of a swift conclusion, attorneys Hogan and MetaLawMan cautioned that complexities, including Judge Torres’ injunction and the $125 million penalty, would likely delay the XRP lawsuit’s resolution. However, MetaLawMan predicted a settlement before April 16 echoing Rispoli’s recent statement. As uncertainty looms, a community member responded to Rispoli’s post. He stated, “If nothing happens in April. Something will happen in May. If nothing happens in May. June is the month. And if not. July for sure.” The thread on X expressed confidence that the XRP lawsuit settlement will occur in the near future, with a guaranteed resolution by July at the latest. In response to the post, Rispoli stated in a playful manner, “Surely you won’t deny August as the month?!?” Though playful, Rispoli’s comment subtly underscored that the XRP lawsuit settlement cannot extend beyond September. Ripple vs SEC Lawsuit End: What To Expect? Notably, as pointed out by Jeremy Hogan and MetaLawMan, the legal complications surrounding the XRP lawsuit will possibly delay its resolution. However, Fred Rispoli dismissed those discussions, addressing the SEC’s excuses cowardly. He posited that the Ripple vs SEC settlement is simple and possible. There’s speculation that the SEC will withdraw its appeal as early as March, paving the way for a potential resolution, while the injunction matter is dealt with subsequently. However, it needs to be seen how the SEC will handle the case and how it will impact the prolonged XRP lawsuit.

Meanwhile, a significant negative impact has also been seen in the crypto space, with Bitcoin continuing to trade under extreme bearish pressure. In the early trading hours, the price slipped to $76,600 in the times when it has been adopted by a U.S. strategic reserve. On the other hand, the trading volume has halved ever since the price failed to rise above $100K, which suggests a massive drop in the trader’s interest. What’s Next—Is the Bitcoin Bear Market Begun? The spot markets have been contributing to the volatility of the token, while the future market is considered to shed light on the price movements in the long term. Even if the spot volume drops, the volume in the futures remains elevated. Interestingly, the volume in both cases has dropped, suggesting the traders have become apathetic. Moreover, the future open interest has also dropped significantly since the last week of February, which substantiates the claim. Secondly, the transaction count has been dropping consistently ever since the BTC price began to escalate in November 2024. This suggests the rise in the institutional involvement or the possibility of carrying out more large transactions, as the drop in the transaction count implies the drop in the trading activity of the retailers. With this, the volatility has been decreasing, which is not good for a healthy price action. Both of the above on-chain indicators suggest a rise in the dominance of the institutions through a rise in the ETF holdings. The rise in ETF accumulation leads towards a rise in BTC value, while a drop impacts the price negatively. This suggests the impact of retail trading has been slashed to a large extent, and as a result, these traders usually turn as scapegoats during massive, long liquidations. What’s Next? Is BTC Heading Back to Fresh Lows? Since the price faced a rejection from the ATH, it has been constantly forming lower highs and lows. This suggests that the bulls have failed to reclaim their dominance, and as a result, every rebound is followed by a huge pullback. Currently, the price has displayed a bullish divergence, but it is expected to be short-lived as the Puell Multiple has remained neutral since the November breakout. The indicator considers Bitcoin miners and their revenue. If the indicator drops to the lower green zone, it indicates the start of a bull run, as it happened back in 2018 and 2021. Currently, the levels are stuck between 0.98 and 1.41 around the average, which suggests the markets are stuck within a strong consolidation phase. After losing the crucial support zone around $85,000, the price appears to have lost another pivotal support at $80,400.

Initially proposed in February, this bipartisan legislation now includes additional provisions to address global concerns and improve oversight while maintaining a focus on fostering innovation. The revised bill reflects feedback from industry leaders and policymakers, introducing measures that could significantly impact both domestic and international stablecoin markets. One of the most significant changes is the expansion of regulations for stablecoins issued overseas . The updated bill mandates that the Secretary of the Treasury must establish agreements with other countries that have similar regulatory standards. These agreements will set clear requirements for reserve management, supervision, anti-money laundering protocols, and compliance with sanctions. The goal is to enhance the global stability of stablecoins and ensure smooth cross-border transactions. This move also aims to protect US interests by aligning foreign-issued stablecoins with US regulations. The bill sets a strict two-year deadline for finalizing these international agreements. The legislation also expands the definition of ""Comptroller-regulated entities"" , which now includes federally approved nonbank stablecoin issuers and other authorized financial institutions. This adjustment gives regulators greater control over the entities permitted to issue stablecoins, ensuring they meet the required legal and financial standards. The goal is to create a structured environment where only compliant organizations can participate in the growing stablecoin sector, ultimately strengthening investor confidence and market stability. Another major aspect of the revised GENIUS Act is the inclusion of strict compliance measures for stablecoin issuers . Under the new rules, issuers must have the capability to comply with legal orders that require blocking, freezing, or seizing stablecoin assets. This means that if authorities demand action against a particular account or transaction, stablecoin issuers must have the technology and processes in place to enforce these legal directives. Additionally, issuers of foreign stablecoins will not be allowed to operate in the US unless they meet all the requirements outlined in the bill. Senator Hagerty emphasized that stablecoins could play a critical role in strengthening financial efficiency and boosting demand for US Treasuries. He stated that this bill ensures a balance between regulatory clarity and market innovation , reinforcing the US as a leader in the global crypto industry. Senator Gillibrand echoed this sentiment, noting that the updates address key areas such as consumer protections, risk management, transparency, and legal oversight. The timing of this bill is critical as discussions around cryptocurrency regulation continue to gain traction in the US. The Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs has scheduled a review session for the bill on March 13, 2025. This will be a pivotal moment in determining how stablecoins are regulated in the future and whether the GENIUS Act can successfully bridge the gap between financial innovation and legal oversight. With the expansion of global cooperation, increased compliance measures, and a clear regulatory framework for issuers, the GENIUS Act represents a major step toward integrating stablecoins into the US financial system. However, questions remain about how the new rules will affect existing projects and whether foreign issuers will be willing to adapt to US regulations . As lawmakers continue to debate the bill, the crypto industry will be watching closely to see how these changes impact the broader digital asset landscape.",,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET|BUSINESS|FIAT|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-11 07:47:32

Marking this level as resistance, it is now on the verge of breaking lower as the supply level increases. Since Bitcoin fell below $100k in January, the market speculation and sentiment for bull run came to a halt as it continued to turn weak daily. Unfortunately, the crypto supplied heavily after a month’s consolidation and the price collapsed into the $78k range in late February. That caused serious panic and fear in the space, but the asset sharply bounced back from that range and retraced to the $95k level after two days of trading. A quick dump from that retracement level brought selling pressure back in the market, and the bears regained control after failing to push higher last week. Crossing into this week on a serious bearish note, the price appears very weak on the day as it approaches a crucial support line. Having posted a substantial loss in the past five days, things might get worse if the leading crypto breaks below the previous monthly low. This low coincides with the crucial support line forming since August 2024. A breakdown there could crash the asset heavily into the $70k range before taking a short break. Currently, no room for the bulls. BTC’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview The previous monthly $78,252 low is considered a key support level for a breakdown. Losing it should dip the price to $73,620 and $69,500. Towards the upside, the $85,120 level serves as resistance, along with the $91k and $95k levels. If Bitcoin managed to retake them, we would consider a bullish move. But for now, the bears have taken over. Key Resistance Levels: $85,120, $91,000, $95,000 Key Support Levels: $78,258, $73,620, $69,500 Spot Price: $80,508 Trend: Bearish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

This move is expected to overturn what industry leaders have called Operation Choke Point 2.0 , a set of restrictions that have made it difficult for crypto banks to operate within the traditional financial system. By lifting these barriers, Trump's order could reshape the digital asset landscape in the United States, providing new opportunities for crypto-friendly financial institutions. The initiative is linked to a broader effort to remove policies that were originally introduced to target high-risk industries, such as payday lenders and firearm dealers, but later expanded to include cryptocurrency firms. Many in the industry argue that these restrictions unfairly blocked crypto businesses from accessing essential banking services. Trump’s order is expected to direct regulatory agencies to change their stance, ensuring that legitimate crypto firms can secure the same financial services as other businesses. One of the most significant potential changes is the push to grant Federal Reserve master accounts to crypto banks. These accounts allow financial institutions to conduct transactions directly with the Federal Reserve , providing a crucial link between the crypto industry and traditional banking. Under the Biden administration, banks such as Custodia faced repeated denials when applying for these accounts, effectively cutting them off from the larger financial system. If Trump’s order succeeds, crypto banks could gain full access to these services, reducing their reliance on intermediaries. While this move is being welcomed by many in the crypto sector, it is expected to face resistance from regulatory bodies. The Federal Reserve operates independently and is not obligated to follow White House directives. This means that even if the executive order is signed, its impact may depend on how the Fed and other financial agencies respond. Some experts predict that central bank officials could push back against the changes, arguing that they need to maintain control over financial stability and risk management. This order would be Trump’s third major crypto-related executive action since returning to office. His first order established a Presidential Working Group focused on digital asset markets, while his second order created a US Bitcoin reserve. However, despite these moves, the broader crypto market has remained volatile. Some industry leaders have expressed frustration, saying that while Trump’s actions appear pro-crypto, they have yet to significantly improve market sentiment. The timing of this executive order is particularly important as the crypto industry navigates a period of uncertainty. Bitcoin and Ethereum prices have recently dropped, with some analysts pointing to broader economic concerns as a key factor. Trump's latest policies, including new tariffs on China , Mexico, and Canada, have created instability in traditional markets, leading some investors to pull funds from crypto-backed financial products. This has added pressure to an already shaky market, making it unclear whether the executive order will be enough to restore confidence among traders. Despite these concerns, the announcement of Trump’s order has reignited debate over the future of cryptocurrency regulation in the US. Supporters argue that providing clearer banking access to crypto firms will encourage innovation and position the US as a leader in digital finance. Critics, however, worry that reducing oversight could lead to greater risks, particularly if banks are forced to process transactions for companies with unclear financial practices. The next steps will depend on how quickly Trump moves to implement the order and how financial regulators react. If the executive action successfully pushes agencies to revise their policies, it could mark a turning point for the crypto industry. However, if resistance from the Federal Reserve slows down implementation, the order may have little immediate effect. Either way, Trump's push to end crypto debanking policies is a major development that will shape the conversation around digital asset regulation in the coming months.",,EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|BTC|REGULATION|ASIA,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-11 07:50:30

Shiba Inu showed wild gains and strong community support in 2021 and has since failed to meet up with that. Today, some experts claim that a new PayFi project with a highly successful presale may reach similar heights. Investors are calling it one of the best cryptos to buy. Its current DeFi coin price is very low, giving early backers a solid chance at high returns. Shiba Inu : A Token Known for Its Explosive Rally Shiba Inu has made headlines before with its dramatic price surge in 2021. The Shiba Inu price once soared to legendary levels. Many investors remember how Shiba Inu captured the imagination with a rally that seemed almost unbelievable. However, Shiba Inu faces challenges such as network congestion and high transaction costs. These issues limit its ability to reach new heights despite its vibrant community. SHIB has gone up by 3.20% to around $0.00001178 over the past 24 hours but experts say it is not sustainable. Shiba Inu price is expected to be stable around that price and ultimately dip by just -1.77% and reach $0.00001209 by April 9. The history of Shiba Inu serves as a reminder of what can happen when a token catches fire. The Shiba Inu price continues to be a topic of discussion among investors, who hope the token can recover its lost glory. Yet, even the best rallies need strong fundamentals to last. Remittix: A New DeFi Project with Real-World Impact Through Remittix people can access a new solution to address persistent global payment challenges. The current traditional banking methods need multiple days to transfer funds and impose heavy fees for their services. The PayFi system of Remittix enables users to execute quick and cost-effective international payments. People who do not possess traditional bank accounts can receive crypto funds and convert to FIAT which they can transfer to an agent to collect physical cash to meet their everyday needs. The payment system lets users maintain control over their money and keep their personal information confidential. During its ongoing ICO Remittix has sold more than 517 million tokens to investors. The DeFi coin stands at $0.0734 in its present market value.This low value makes RTX affordable to both new and savvy investors. Remittix addresses major obstacles that stop people from adopting cryptocurrency. A majority of tokens on the market deal with speed-related issues together with elevated transaction costs and unclear functional advantages. The system removes numerous additional processes which slow down payment transactions to enhance speed. The system from Remittix illustrates how safety and practicality can coexist in one token. Since it functions practically it avoids becoming another speculative coin. Remittix presents itself as a solution to distribute cryptocurrency to those who require it by overcoming gradual and costly international transaction issues. Buy The RTX Presale To Get Started The ongoing dispute exists regarding which token possesses legendary potential. Shiba Inu reached maximum popularity through a powerful price increase. Shiba Inu demonstrates what rapid price appreciations appear likely in the cryptocurrency market. The token Remittix exhibits genuine potential in the market. Through its PayFi system it resolves typical payment problems between nations and distributes control to banking-excluded users. Remittix demonstrates signs of reaching parabolic growth as it emerges as a market leader. The success of RTX as a token with practical applications should draw investor attention because it may usher in new standards across international money transfers.

The rule, introduced under former SEC Chair Gary Gensler , aimed to redefine what qualifies as an exchange by including certain communication protocols . Critics argued that the broad wording could have unintentionally regulated platforms that weren’t designed to be under SEC control. Now, acting Chair Mark Uyeda has moved to withdraw the proposal, signaling a major shift in the agency’s regulatory stance. This decision aligns with broader changes happening at the SEC under new leadership appointed by President Donald Trump . In recent weeks, the agency has also dropped at least six enforcement cases against major crypto companies, including actions targeting Kraken, Coinbase, Robinhood, and MetaMask . This suggests a significant easing of regulatory pressure, which had been a point of contention for crypto industry leaders and investors. Alongside these rollbacks, the SEC Crypto Task Force , now led by Commissioner Hester Peirce , is adopting a more collaborative approach to digital asset regulation. The task force, which includes experts like Richard Gabbert, Michael Selig, Taylor Asher, and Sumeera Younis , has announced a series of industry discussions. These “Spring Sprint Toward Crypto Clarity” roundtables will begin on March 21 , providing a platform for policymakers, industry leaders, and legal experts to address regulatory challenges and discuss the future of compliance in the crypto space. With these developments, the SEC appears to be stepping away from its aggressive enforcement stance under Gensler and instead focusing on engagement and clarity . This shift is expected to have significant implications for how crypto businesses operate in the U.S., potentially paving the way for a more open and innovation-friendly regulatory environment . However, it remains to be seen how much influence the SEC will maintain over the rapidly evolving digital asset industry and whether these changes will lead to clearer, long-term rules for crypto firms.",,EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-11 07:53:12

Negotiating the next major move, it currently sits at $2k after posting roughly 13% in a week. Following a notable loss in the last three months, Ethereum’s correlation with Bitcoin’s movement remains intact from a short-term perspective. However, things have turned uglier lately as the asset continued to paint serious bearish scenarios after retracing slightly earlier this month. It just reached a crucial trading zone and looks set to lose the important $2k level at the time of writing. While the selling pressure is now calm, it seems to be negotiating the important level from a technical standpoint. An increase in the supply level could cause a serious collapse in the near term. If that happens, the October 2023 surge level of $1,600 will be the key target range to watch for a test. A strong hold above this important level could trigger a brief consolidation phase before breaking lower. Whichever way, Ethereum will likely lose this key level, considering the past months of reductions. It appeared to end the bullish cycle as it slowly gathered momentum for a major crash on a long-term scale. ETH’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview Retaking the $2,076 level could bring a retest at last week’s $2,310 high. Right above this high lies the $2,550 level, marked as the monthly high. If by chance ETH reclaims it, we may see a slight market structure shift. But from the look of things, Ethereum will likely go more bearish, and it may navigate the $1,904 support soon. The next support levels to watch below it are $1,750 and $1,640 – drawn from the October 2023 levels. Key Resistance Levels: $2,076, $2,310, $2,550 Key Support Levels: $1,904, $1,750, $1,640 Spot Price: $2,036 Trend: Bearish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

This has resulted in a 6% fall to $2.6 trillion as all post-US election gains have now been wiped out. Ethereum has taken the brunt of the fall, losing a whopping 16% over 12 hours as it fell from around $2,140 to just below $1,800. Moreover, ETH is struggling to recover and was trading at $1,860 at the time of writing. ETH Death? The last time Ethereum traded below $1,800 was in October 2023, when it was slowly emerging from the two-year-long bear market. There is solid support at current levels, which must be held to prevent the asset from tanking back to bear market lows following the formation of what appears to be a double-top chart pattern. Analysts have warned that if support here is lost, ETH could fall as low as $1,200 . Ethereum is currently down a painful 62% from its all-time high in 2021, and the ETH/BTC ratio – which is a measure of the price of ETH in terms of Satoshis – is at its lowest level since December 2020, having fallen to 0.023 today, according to Tradingview. Only Dogecoin (DOGE) had heavier losses than Ethereum in the crypto top twenty today, with the memecoin melting by 11%. It does beg the question of who would be selling ETH at $2,000 and the answer appears to be whales that are trying to avoid being liquidated, according to Lookonchain. Needless to say, the Ethereum derision and FUD had escalated to new heights on Crypto Twitter as traders and investors licked their wounds. Ethereum Testnet Attacked The ETH angst has been exacerbated by problems with Pectra testing and an unknown attacker sending zero-token transfers, causing empty blocks. On March 9, Ethereum developer Marius van der Wijden said the issue had been fixed: “We suspected that the attacker was reading some of our chats, so we decided not to publicize the fix, but only update a few nodes that we controlled in order to get more full blocks on the network,” The post Ethereum Double Trouble: ETH Prices Fall Below $1,800 Price Crash Amid Testnet Attack appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|ETHBTC|ETHUSD|Ethereum|Ethereum (ETH) Price,EN,0,0,ETH|TRADING|MARKET|DOGE|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-03-11 07:54:43

The intense pain in the stock market has trickled into the crypto market amid the ongoing U.S.-led tariff wars. Moreover, more than $950 million was liquidated in the crypto market during the past 24 hours, mostly involving long traders, thus escalating the odds of a long squeeze. Pi Coin Price Prediction Following the launch of the Open Mainnet, Pi Coin has been subjected to the crypto market forces in the past few weeks. The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $15.4 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of around $535 million, dropped over 24 percent in the past seven days to trade about $1.38 on Tuesday, March 11, during the mid-London session. From a technical analysis perspective, Pi Price has confirmed a reversal pattern after closing below the neckline of a head and shoulders (H&S) formation in the past two days. In the four-hour time frame, Pi Coin has been forming a bearish continuation pattern as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) continues to signal bearish divergence. In the near term, Pi Coin will likely drop another 15-20 percent towards the support level of around $1.16. The short-term bearish sentiment will be invalidated if Pi Coin consistently closes above $1.77 in the coming weeks. Future of Pi Network The Pi Network has grown to a vast network of over 60 million users in the past years, largely due to its mobile mining infrastructure compared to the energy-intensive mining process of Bitcoin, Dogecoin (DOGE), and Litecoin (LTC). With the rising adoption of decentralized financial (DeFi) protocols, the Pi Network is keen to build utility-driven web3 projects to actively engage the community. As a result, the decisions made by the core team in 2025 will significantly influence the fate of the Pi Network in the coming years. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

A recent interview with President Donald Trump, in which he hinted at the possibility of a recession, has further unsettled investors. Crypto Market Plummets: XRP, Solana, And Cardano Follow Bitcoin’s Downtrend Bitcoin, the flagship cryptocurrency, has fallen nearly 4% in the last 24 hours, dropping toward the $79,000 mark—a level not seen since mid-November. Ethereum (ETH), has taken a more significant hit with a 10% drop toward $1,860, price not seen since August. Other established cryptocurrencies are also feeling the strain; XRP has declined by 4%, Solana (SOL) by 7%, and Cardano (ADA) by 8% as market participants continue to retreat from riskier assets. The backdrop to this volatility includes the continuous aggressive tariff policies imposed by the new President Donald Trump administration towards countries like Canada, China, and Mexico. Related Reading: Bitcoin Slips Under 200-Day Moving Average – Will The Downtrend Continue? These actions have sparked fears of a trade war, which could exacerbate inflation and increase the cost of imported goods. As a result, investors are gravitating toward safer investments, steering clear of the notoriously volatile cryptocurrency market. In a Fox News interview over the weekend, Trump acknowledged that the aggressive tariff strategy could lead to a recession, describing the country as entering a “period of transition.” This commentary has raised alarms among investors, particularly as Trump did not rule out the possibility of a recession occurring this year. Jake Ostrovskis, an over-the-counter trader at Wintermute, noted that the former president emphasized the likelihood of “short-term economic pain,” amplifying market anxieties. Diminished Risk Appetite And Fed Rate Outlook Adding to the uncertainty is the recent letdown regarding the White House’s plans for a national crypto reserve. Many in the crypto community had anticipated that Trump’s proposal would involve substantial government purchases of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, potentially stimulating demand and boosting prices. However, investors were disappointed when it was revealed that the government would refrain from making additional crypto purchases and would only retain cryptocurrencies seized from illegal activities. Haider Rafique, the global chief marketing officer at crypto exchange OKX, expressed disappointment in the lack of immediate buying pressure from the formalization of a Bitcoin reserve. “While establishing a Bitcoin reserve is a significant milestone, it does not create immediate buying pressure, disappointing those expecting aggressive accumulation,” Rafique stated.

Since the Federal Reserve announced in December that it would not implement as many interest rate cuts in 2025 as previously anticipated, the crypto market has lost approximately 25% of its total market cap. The optimistic outlook that many had following Trump’s election in November has quickly turned sour, as macroeconomic factors weigh heavily on the market.

Unfortunately, the current market sentiment for these cryptos supports a bearish trend, especially after the recent Solana news. The possibility of a market crash after this downward spiral isn’t far-fetched, and it has prompted investors to start moving their funds elsewhere. Panshibi , a viral meme coin, is discussed among market participants as a must-have in this market turbulence. This text has everything we know about this new crypto and why crypto observers will watch it for 100x in 2025. Panshibi: Panda-Themed Meme Coin Set To Lead The Market in 2025 Panshibi is the new viral memecoin that draws inspiration from the Pandas in Asian culture. Panshibi’s Panda mascot brings together a diverse community of folks into the Bamboo Valley. These include the Asian market participants, Panda enthusiasts, meme coin enthusiasts, etc. With such a large following, it is no wonder that Panshibi’s presale inflows have surged within a fortnight. Thousands of investors have contributed over $1.23 million to its ecosystem, and more are gearing up to join the trend. In return for such active participation, early buyers have seen an increase of over 150% and anticipate a 400% surge once the presale ends. Interestingly, Panshibi has implemented strict security measures to ensure that early buyers reap their harvests. For instance, the project locks liquidity for ten years and team tokens for two years. In the long run, this ensures that early investors are protected from insider selloffs or scams. It is also worth mentioning that Panshibi provides a bountiful income opportunity for its investors through its high-end reward programs. With staking rewards reaching up to 1,200% APY, early presale buyers generate passive income while contributing to the ecosystem. The Panshibi project team commits 15% of the total supply to staking rewards, ensuring this incentive can be sustained regularly. XRP Price Prediction: $1 In Sight Amid SEC Tussel And Massive Whale Selloff XRP, the fourth largest token by market cap, is experiencing a significant price drop, trading at approximately $2.03. The Coinmarketcap data shows that XRP has had a 4.7% decline in the last 24 hours and a whopping 15.77% drop over the past month. This adverse price action is the backdrop of the shaking market sentiment for XRP. Notably, the regulatory cloud over XRP is weighing on its investors’ confidence. While Ripple scored a partial legal victory in mid-2024, the judge’s ruling that XRP is not a security for retail sales has damaged the asset’s reputation. Ripple’s technical analysis echoes this point, and several chart experts have suggested a bleak XRP price prediction. In a recent tweet, a top analyst named Ali Martinez noted that the XRP price risks correcting to $1 in the coming weeks. The analyst argued that a head-and-shoulder pattern on the XRP price chart started forming in December 2024. Solana News Today: Sol Plunges 40% Despite Us Stockpile Inclusion Even though Solana is one of three altcoins to be included in President Trump’s Digital Asset Stockpile, its price continues to decline abruptly. Interestingly, the bullish Solana news reports that Solana has slumped 40% despite the injection of $10 billion in new liquidity. Part of Solana’s downtrend may be attributed to investors seeking safer assets following the network’s recent wave of memecoin scams. Onchain data from Defilama shows that Solana was hit by over $485 million outflows in February, with investor capital mainly flowing to Ethereum, Arbitrum, and the BNB Chain. Conclusion As the Solana and Cardano prices face terrible market volatility, Panshibi quickly becomes investors’ safe bet to ride this turbulent period. Panshibi’s future is not only bright but also hugely profitable. The opportunity is ripe for those who act now. SHIBI tokens are still available at a fair entry price of $0.005 each, but this window won’t last long.

Crypto investors and traders are panic selling again as sentiment turned sour, but this has all happened before in previous bull market cycles. Crypto analysts ‘Rekt Capital’ looked at previous cycles, noting that the average BTC correction in 2017 was 35%, and in the 2021 cycle, it was 37%. If it is to fall between these during this market cycle, prices could drop as low as $70,000. Patience is Key In late February, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes predicted a fall to $70,000 as large hedge funds unwound their ETF positions to seek better yield opportunities. “Be f***ing patient,” he said on March 10, reiterating that prediction that BTC would likely bottom around $70,000. A 36% correction from an all-time high is “very normal for a bull market,” he added. He said that central banks would start adjusting their monetary policies, which is when markets will bounce back. Capriole Fund founder Charles Edwards agreed with the notion saying , “As things get bearish, they also get more bullish,” before adding: “The worse the economic data becomes, the more relatively discounted Bitcoin tends to get and the more likely we are to see Fed easing.” “It can be wise to await a good technical recovery bounce or a key policy change instead of trying to catch falling knives,” he advised. Recession Fears Loom Recession fears have rattled investors who heavily sold off tech stocks and crypto assets on Monday. The S&P 500, tech-heavy Nasdaq, and Dow Jones Industrial Average all fell heavily as the American “magnificent 7” shed more than $750 billion in market capitalization in one day amid the US stock rout. Leading Wall Street banks such as JPMorgan have increased their odds of a recession in 2025 and decreased their predictions for GDP growth. Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood said the “market is discounting the last leg of a rolling recession,” which will give the Trump administration and central bank “many more degrees of freedom than investors expect,” leading to a recovery in the second half of this year.

Source: TradingView US recession fears hurt XRP price Escalating concerns over a potential US economic slowdown have dampened investor sentiment across financial markets, hurting XRP and the broader cryptocurrency sector. Key points: Crypto and tech stocks saw a large sell-off on March 10 due to rising US recession fears. JPMorgan raised the US recession risk to 40%, up from 30% at the start of 2025, citing extreme US policies as a key risk. The Trump administration’s recent imposition of tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada, and China has heightened fears of a global trade war. President Trump’s acknowledgment of a potential recession during a ""period of transition"" has further unsettled investors. Goldman Sachs has also increased its 12-month recession probability to 20%, up from 15%, warning that the forecast could rise if Trump maintains current policies.

White House Crypto Summit fails to impress XRP bulls XRP's price took a sharp hit following the White House’s inaugural Crypto Summit on March 7, as hopes for its inclusion in a US strategic crypto reserve were swiftly dashed . Key takeaways: Initial excitement faded after President Donald Trump’s team clarified that Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and XRP were used as illustrative examples, not official selections for the US reserve.

XRP risks 45% crash ahead XRP’s price decline today is furthermore a part of its prevailing head-and-shoulders pattern. Key points: An H&S pattern forms when the price forms three consecutive highs, with the middle peak (head) higher than the other two (shoulders). As a technical rule, the pattern resolves when the price breaks below its common support (neckline) and falls by as much as the pattern’s maximum height. XRP/USD three-day price chart. Source: TradingView As of March 10, XRP had formed what appears to be the H&S pattern’s right shoulder and was heading toward the neckline support at around $2. A decisive breakdown below the support level could send the XRP price toward $1.11 by April, down by over 45% from the current prices. Can XRP resume its bull run? A rebound from $2 neckline support could delay or invalidate the H&S pattern. Interestingly, the level aligns with two other support levels: the lower trendline of XRP’s prevailing symmetrical triangle pattern and the 50-3D EMA. XRP/USD three-day price chart. Source: TradingView A bounce, followed by a decisive close above the triangle’s upper trendline, could trigger a breakout scenario toward $3.44.

On March 10, a wallet address deposited 30,098 Ether ( ETH ), worth about $56 million, into Sky. Crypto intelligence platform Arkham labeled the address “Ethereum Foundation?,” raising speculation that the EF may have moved funds into the lending protocol — a strategy recommended by the community — instead of directly selling ETH to fund its operations. However, community members quickly dismissed the claims, clarifying that the wallet in question does not belong to the Ethereum Foundation. Eric Conner, the co-author of Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP-1559), called a Wu Blockchain report “completely fake,” implying that the address doesn’t belong to the EF. Anthony Sassano, host of The Daily Gwei , also cited the report, saying that the wallet does not belong to the EF. Source: Anthony Sassano Ethereum wallet likely from an early investor Wu Blockchain later clarified that while the account was suspected of belonging to the Ethereum Foundation, transaction history suggested it was more likely associated with an early Ethereum investor. The address received a 4 million Dai ( DAI ) transfer from the EF ETH Sale in May 2022, and initial ETH funding was traced back to a wallet called jonny.eth. The address deposited the $56 million into the Sky vault to avoid liquidation as ETH prices tumbled. On March 10, ETH dropped from a high of $2,138 to $1,813, a 15% decline. The move allowed the wallet to avoid liquidation, lowering its liquidation price to $1,127.14, 40.19% below ETH’s price of $1,896 at the time of writing. Related: Ethereum Foundation forms external council to uphold core blockchain values Ethereum Foundation deployed $120 million into DeFi protocols While the recent deposit into Sky was not linked to the Ethereum Foundation, the EF has faced criticism in the past for selling ETH for stablecoins to fund team salaries and operations. In January, community members suggested that the foundation could instead borrow stablecoins against its ETH holdings rather than sell the assets. At the time, Sassano said that instead of swapping ETH for stablecoins, the foundation should consider using Aave to borrow stablecoins against ETH. Sky allows users to do something similar. By depositing ETH, users can borrow DAI. On Feb. 13, the EF listened to the community and deployed 45,000 ETH , about $120 million at the time, to DeFi protocols Aave, Spark and Compound. Community members celebrated the move, with Aave founder and CEO Stani Kulechov saying, “DeFi will win.” The EF also said there’s “more to come,” suggesting this is not their last foray into DeFi.

Scam losses reached billions, with pig butchering and phishing among the most damaging schemes. Canadian regulators also recently warned of frauds exploiting trade war fears, while Coinbase’s security chief, Philip Martin, called for a unified crypto scam reporting system in the US to improve enforcement and victim support. Rising Crypto and AI Scams Cost Investors The California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) identified seven new types of cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence-related scams that emerged in 2024. The regulator reported receiving 2,668 complaints from users who fell victim to fraudulent schemes, many of which were not previously recorded. Among these were fake Bitcoin mining investment schemes, where scammers lure victims with promises of high returns, and deceptive crypto gaming platforms that encourage users to deposit funds before draining their wallets. Other reported scams included fraudulent job offers requiring crypto transfers and private information, phishing attacks that steal private keys through fake airdrops, and fake investment groups operating on WhatsApp and Telegram. Additionally, AI investment scams promising unrealistically high returns have surfaced, while some users reported losing crypto after interacting with certain fraudulent websites. (Source: DFPI ) The very quick growth of the AI industry certainly contributed to the expansion of cyber fraud. A rise in crimeware-as-a-service (CaaS) was also noticed, where skilled hackers and cybercriminals sell their tools to less experienced offenders, which only complicates law enforcement efforts even more. DFPI Commissioner KC Mohseni urged the public to be very cautious when dealing with unknown platforms and advised users to verify website domains to avoid fraudulent imitations. Through its state-level partnerships, the DFPI claims that it shut down more than 26 fraudulent crypto websites and uncovered $4.6 million in user losses over the past year. Meanwhile, the California Department of Justice (DOJ) took down 42 crypto scam websites in 2024, which collectively defrauded victims of $6.5 million. This was equal to an average loss per person of more than $146,000. The DOJ also pointed out some common warning signs that are associated with these scams, like guarantees of high returns, lack of contact information, and fake prize offers. Many of these fraudulent platforms were also missing from legitimate crypto industry directories like CoinMarketCap. (Source: California DOJ ) A report from on-chain security firm Cyvers identified pig butchering schemes as one of the most financially damaging scams of 2024 as it cost the industry an estimated $5.5 billion across 200,000 cases. Additionally, blockchain security firm CertiK’s annual Web3 security report flagged phishing attacks as the most dangerous security threat of the year, with losses amounting to $1 billion across 296 incidents. Crypto Scammers Exploit Trade War Fears More recently, securities regulators in Alberta and New Brunswick warned that crypto scammers are using fake news articles and the likeness of government figures to exploit fears surrounding the ongoing trade war. The Alberta Securities Commission issued an alert on March 7 about a crypto investment scam called CanCap, that falsely claimed endorsement from then-Prime Minister Justin Trudeau through a fabricated news article appearing to be from Canada’s national public broadcaster, CBC. The fake article suggested that Trudeau was promoting a digital currency investment program as a response to US tariffs. Similarly, the Financial and Consumer Services Commission of New Brunswick flagged that CanCap used a fraudulent article that was designed to mimic the Telegraph-Journal, falsely stating that Premier Susan Holt endorsed the platform. The commission stated that the scam article included a fake transcript of an interview with Holt and doctored photos depicting her unveiling the project. Uncertainty surrounding US trade policies contributed to the financial anxiety among Canadians, especially after President Donald Trump imposed a 25% tariff on Canadian goods in February. He partially rolled it back, but then quickly threatened a 250% tariff on lumber and dairy. Mark Carney, who replaced Trudeau as prime minister on March 9, called Trump’s actions harmful to Canadian families and vowed to fight back in the trade war. Regulators warned that scammers are taking advantage of economic uncertainty by using artificial intelligence to fabricate endorsements and generate content to make fraudulent investment schemes look more legitimate. They warned that these schemes are highly adaptable, as the scammers frequently rebrand under new names like CanCentra and Immediate Flectinium. Crypto-related scams, exploits, and hacks caused global losses of close to $1.53 billion in February alone. This was due to the $1.4 billion attack on crypto exchange Bybit, according to blockchain security firm CertiK . Coinbase Calls for Unified Crypto Scam Reporting System Coinbase chief security officer Philip Martin called for a more streamlined approach when it comes to reporting crypto scams in the United States. He argued that the current system is too fragmented. At the SXSW conference in Austin, Texas, Martin mentioned some of the challenges victims face in navigating the patchwork of agencies handling financial and internet crimes. He believes there is a need for a unified reporting system to better quantify the scale of the problem and allocate government resources more effectively. Currently, victims report scams to various federal and state-level agencies, including the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3). However, Martin noticed that many victims feel like they are “screaming into the void” when submitting complaints, as they rarely receive feedback or updates on their cases. He suggested consolidating reporting platforms into a single system that will centralize data and provide victims with more transparency. FBI’s Roger Campbell (center left) on a panel with Coinbase’s Philip Martin (center right). Other panelists include former Twitter safety lead Yoel Roth (right) and MSNBC reporter Mackenzie Sigalos (left) During a panel on online fraud, retired FBI agent Roger Campbell agreed with Martin’s concerns, and described the reporting process as frustrating and ineffective. He pointed to the UK’s centralized crime reporting system as a model for improving victim support and investigative efficiency. Campbell noted that victims who report scams to the IC3 rarely hear back, which can leave them feeling re-victimized. Martin also talked about the lag in scam reporting, where fraudulent schemes may go unnoticed for months before authorities finally become aware of them. Additionally, he stressed that most crypto scams are conducted from outside the US in countries like Myanmar and Laos, making enforcement efforts difficult. He argued that international cooperation should be a priority to ensure that scammers have no safe havens. The discussion comes as the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation reported receiving over 2,600 complaints in the past year. Overall, the growing prevalence of scams proves that there is a serious need for a more effective reporting framework to combat financial fraud in the crypto space.",News|Security,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION|BTC,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-11 09:17:17

Whale Alert reported the whopping transaction, highlighting the increasing activity among major XRP holders. Given the scale of the transaction, market analysts are closely watching for potential price implications. https://twitter.com/whale_alert/status/1899084005418406227 Whale movements often signal strategic positioning by large investors, and such transactions can be linked to institutional activity, liquidity reshuffling, or preparatory steps for an upcoming market shift. While XRP’s price has experienced fluctuations, the growing number of large-scale transfers suggests that whales remain engaged with the asset. Surge in XRP Whale Transactions This transaction is part of a larger trend in rising whale activity surrounding XRP. Over the past few weeks, multiple substantial transfers have been recorded. There has been an increase in whale activity and many market participants believe these signal increased accumulation and a potential market shift. A few days ago, $5.37 billion worth of XRP was traded in 24 hours. This massive volume indicates heightened interest from major players. This move also coincided with the over 1 billion tokens accumulated by whales in under a day, showcasing whales’ interest in the digital asset. https://twitter.com/TimesTabloid1/status/1680250907504656385 Market Impact and Price Implications Large-scale transactions like these often generate speculation regarding price movements. Whale accumulation can be seen as a bullish sign, suggesting confidence in the asset’s future performance. However, such transfers can also lead to volatility, depending on whether the XRP is being moved for long-term holding, institutional adoption, or potential sell-offs. Recent price trends have shown XRP attempting to recover from previous losses. However, most of these attempts have been met with significant resistance, and some experts are already advising investors on actions to take if the digital asset falls below $1. Institutional Involvement and Future Outlook Whale activity is often linked to broader institutional movements, regulatory developments, or upcoming partnerships. Given XRP’s role in cross-border payments and increasing integration into financial ecosystems, these transactions may be part of larger institutional strategies. With Ripple rapidly increasing its global partnerships , we could see more institutional activity. The sheer volume of recent whale transactions suggests that significant shifts may be on the horizon and this increased whale activity could help XRP recover.

This drop follows a loss of post-election gains, with many attributing the decline to CEO Elon Musk’s political involvement. Alongside Tesla’s struggles, Dogecoin (DOGE) price has also faced significant losses, hovering around $0.15 amidst broader cryptocurrency market corrections. The question remains: can Dogecoin recover from this downturn? Tesla Drops 15%, Is Dogecoin Price Set for a Comeback? Tesla’s stock has experienced a significant drop of over 15%, resulting in a loss of $125 billion in market value. This decline follows a decrease in the company’s vehicle sales and profits, as well as a broader market selloff driven by fears of tariffs and recession. The $1.5 trillion market capitalization peak that Tesla hit in December 2021 has suffered a 45% decline, leading to substantial stock price losses since Elon Musk took part in backing Donald Trump’s election campaign. The stock value has decreased because shareholders worry about Musk’s political actions, including backing Trump while firing large numbers of U.S. government staff. These actions have raised doubts about whether Musk is distracted from managing Tesla’s core business. Despite the downturn, Tesla’s market cap remains up by approximately $65 billion since the presidential election, indicating the ongoing confidence in the company’s future prospects. Will Dogecoin Price Break Key Support at $0.15? The latest DOGE price has been fluctuating recently, with crypto market experiencing the fluctuation. As of March 11, 2025, the DOGE price has experienced a decrease of 8%, currently at $0.1584. The price has been hovering between a crucial support level of $0.15 and resistance near $0.20. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator on the 4-hour chart shows a bearish trend. The MACD line has dipped below the signal line, suggesting a potential decline in momentum. The Relative Strength Index is currently sitting at 31, indicating that DOGE is nearing oversold conditions. If the downward pressure continues, the price may test the $0.10 support level in the near term. Conversely, if Dogecoin price prediction manages to break through the resistance level at $0.16, a potential rally toward the $0.20 level could occur. Dogecoin Price Chart: TradingView The latest report indicates that whales purchased over 1.40 billion Dogecoin in the last 24 hours. This surge in large-scale purchases by significant holders could likely lead to increased price volatility. As whale transactions influence market trends, the added buying pressure might push Dogecoin’s value higher in the short term. Consequently, this activity could signal bullish sentiment for the token. To sum up, Tesla’s 15% loss raises concerns about its future, while Dogecoin’s price may see fluctuations amid market corrections. Whether DOGE can recover or break through key support levels remains to be seen.

Increased trading volume suggests market uncertainty despite XRP’s brief rebound. RSI near oversold levels, but MACD signals ongoing bearish momentum for XRP. The recent downturn in XRP’s price has sparked concerns among investors, particularly after a sharp 11% drop. As of press time, XRP is trading at $2.08 , reflecting a 4.21% decline in the past 24 hours. This downturn follows US President Donald Trump’s failure to provide clear plans regarding XRP’s inclusion in the nation’s digital asset stockpile. While he confirmed the establishment of a Bitcoin reserve and an altcoin stockpile using seized assets, the absence of explicit mention of XRP has led to uncertainty in the market. With heightened trading activity and a noticeable dip, many investors are now questioning whether XRP can stage a recovery in the near future.

Arthur Hayes Predicts Bitcoin Will Bottom at $70K Before Rising to $250K Hayes described a potential 36% correction from Bitcoin’s all-time high of $110,000 as a normal occurrence in a bull market, stressing that such pullbacks are typical before the next rally. Long-Term Bitcoin Forecast: $250K in 2025, $1M in the Future Previously, Hayes predicted that Bitcoin would initially fall to the $70,000-$75,000 range before rising to $250,000 by the end of 2025. Looking even further ahead, he argues that BTC could eventually reach $1 million. His bullish outlook is in line with expectations of increasing institutional adoption, global macroeconomic changes, and continued inflationary pressure, which he believes will propel Bitcoin to new highs.

The leaders of SOL agree with skeptics who predict new competitors could dominate future bull cycles over traditional blockchain giants. The recently released presale of Mutuum Finance has gained momentum since its launch. The presale has started phase three following the fast completion of its initial selling period. The project receives strong investor interest as it grows its stake size to $3 million and acquires 5,100 holder accounts. The token value stands at $0.02 in present but phase 3 will raise it to $0.025. An investment made during the present presale period will generate double the original value when the platform’s official launch happens at $0.06. Market analysts establish a $1 price target for the upcoming market surge which will deliver 50x investment returns to all investors. These investors are now looking for the following altcoin leader which has the potential to take control of the upcoming market surge. Solana’s Dominance: Can It Hold Its Lead in 2025? Solana (SOL) established itself as a leading blockchain platform that provides quick processing combined with minimal costs and an expanding user network. Solana holds its position as a popular investment despite market fluctuations because its value stands at $137. Financial experts argue that upcoming blockchain innovations might replace Solana as the market leader throughout the next crypto bull market. Mutuum Finance emerges as an innovative leader during the 2025 altcoin market surge which threatens to dethrone Solana from its current top position. Surging Interest in the MUTM Presale The MUTM presale’s popularity continues to rise in phase 3 since 5100 investors have so far deposited $3 million in the first several days of token sales. MUTM tokens will escalate their price during the presale period toward the launch which will grant phase 3 investors a 200% appreciation when buying at $0.06. Analysts anticipate that upon listing, Mutuum Finance could surpass $1, with upcoming exchange integrations further strengthening its investment appeal. The design of Mutuum Finance emphasizes both future expansion sustainability and innovative features alongside secure and scalable architecture. The platform uses predictive smart contracts for efficient lending operations as well as providing multi-network transaction capabilities through its cross-platform functionality. Investors generate passive income by participating in staking rewards while enhancing their commitment to long periods of time. Gliding forward will be the USD stablecoin launch which brings stability by creating a system-backed asset for the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance builds its position as a top DeFi investment platform by expanding liquidity while preparing for stock market listings. Mutuum Finance conducts a $100,000 MUTM token giveaway that distributes $10,000 tokens to 10 winners who join during its early adopter celebration. A referral program exists to reward investors who refer new members by adding extra benefits to their rewards. Why MUTM is Reshaping DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance transforms decentralized lending through its advanced dual-lending construct which combines adaptable features with maximum operation effectiveness. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model uses smart contracts to improve capital availability and enables automatic interest rate modifications which help lenders and borrowers gain advantages. The Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model functions without intermediaries so users can establish individualized loan arrangements. Mutuum Finance stands out as an top-performing service within the DeFi lending market because of its distinctive dual-lending system. Analytics indicate that a new blockchain will surpass Solana (SOL) to become the main contributor to the upcoming 2025 altcoin expansion. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale successfully brought in more than $3 million from 5,100+ investors who joined the operation. Early buyers can expect a 200% Return on Investment ($0.06) when Mutuum Finance (MUTM) releases at $0.025 during Phase 3 after its current price of $0.02. Analysts anticipate a rise of $1 for MUTM as they forecast a 50x return. MUTM is planning to disrupt the DeFi industry through its dual-lending model as well as multi-chain accessibility and stake rewards system.

Leveraged traders betting on a rally got torched with $420 million in BTC longs and $150 million in ETH longs being liquidated, alongside $30 million in DOGE long losses. Solana (SOL) shed 8%, and XRP slipped 7%, with the broader CoinDesk 20 (CD20) falling more than 6.5%. Open interest in BTC futures dropped 7% to $45 billion, signaling forced exits as margin calls hit. “Investors are taking a risk-off approach as the chances for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut diminished after a stable jobs report and anticipation that February's CPI report will follow similarly to January's reading,” Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “Traders may sideline and offset risk in their portfolios until the US economic situation becomes clearer and the need for a rate cut becomes stronger, which may not happen until later this year,” Ruck added. Monday’s losses extended a two-week downward spiral exacerbated by shaky global sentiment, with the S&P 500 down 2% and the Nasdaq off 3% at the start of the week. The sell-off was driven by renewed fears of the impact of U.S. trade tariffs that are set to kick in next month and renewed fears of a recession after a Donald Trump interview on Sunday. That was the biggest one-day drop in U.S. equities since September 2022, with the so-called ‘Magnificent 7’ cohort losing $830 billion in market capitalization. Besides, a stronger U.S. dollar, and a hawkish Federal Reserve signal in late February — with plans of fewer rate cuts in 2025 — and a flight to safe-haven assets gold and Japanese yen have further dented hopes of a recovery in the short term. One contrarian sentiment indicator, however, presents limited hope for bulls looking for short-term relief. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is hovering at 15 — deep in “extreme fear” territory — suggesting that capitulation could set the stage for a relief rally. Singapore-based QCP Capital said watching Treasury yields and dollar strength present cues for further positioning. “Despite the market turmoil, not all signals are bearish. This wave of risk-off sentiment has driven 10-year Treasury yields down by around 60 bps and weakened the U.S. dollar — a historically positive factor for USD-denominated risk assets like U.S. equities and crypto,” QCP said in a market broadcast on Tuesday. “Lower yields also provide a reprieve for the U.S. government, easing borrowing costs at a time when refinancing needs are massive. This comes at a critical moment as Trump's policy roadmap, particularly proposed tax cuts and a more expansionary fiscal stance, takes shape,” the firm added.",Markets,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|TRADING|MARKET|FIAT,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-11 09:30:39

Currently valued around $79,000, Bitcoin’s price is precariously balanced above a crucial support level dubbed as “the magic line,” which is set at $74,000, pivotal in determining the market’s trajectory—bullish or bearish. A Historical Buffer Against Bear Markets In a recent social media post on X (formerly Twitter), market expert Doctor Profit emphasized that “the magic line” placed at $74,000 in his analysis is not just a number but a key indicator of market sentiment. Related Reading: Charts Reveal Cardano Holds Key Support Zone – Staying Above Could ‘Set The Next Move’ According to the expert, this line has historically acted as a buffer against bear market conditions. For instance, during the 2020 market correction, Bitcoin held above this support level until a bear market was confirmed. Doctor Profit asserts, “A massive correction, even 30-50%, does NOT mean a bear market.” This market volatility is exacerbated by fears of a recession, driven in part by President Donald Trump’s aggressive tariff policies targeting countries like China, Canada, and Mexico. These actions have ignited concerns over a potential trade war, further dampening investor sentiment and leading to a retreat from riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies. However, BTC is not alone in this downtrend. Peers such as Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA), have also followed Bitcoin’s lead in this regard, experiencing 10%, 6%,5% and 6% drops respectively in the 24-hour time frame. Optimal Bitcoin Entry Point Between $52,000 and $60,000? In another recent post on social media platform X, Doctor Profit discussed a possible recession scenario, suggesting that the optimal entry point for investors might be between $52,000 and $60,000. This forecast implies a troubling potential drop of another 34% from $79,000 towards the worst case scenario for BTC’s price at $52,000 if this occurs, heightening concerns among traders and investors alike. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Strong For Over A Year: Monthly Close Below This Level Could Be Catastrophic Doctor Profit remains vigilant, monitoring not only Bitcoin’s movements but also the stock market’s influence on crypto prices. He has set his sights on a critical short position with a target profit level (TP1) aligning with the magic line. “If Bitcoin bounces hard, I’ll re-enter,” the market expert stated. Doctor Profit concluded his analysis saying that “If it shows weakness, I’ll stay in cash and hunt for lower entries between $50,000 and $60,000.” While finding at least a temporary foothold at the $79,460 mark, the largest digital asset, BTC, is down 14% in the past two weeks, reaching its lowest level since November 2024.

Big Claim from Famous US CEO!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/are-trump-and-his-team-behind-the-collapse-of-bitcoin-btc-and-altcoins-big-claim-from-famous-us-ceo/,"Although the leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin rose to $83,000 during the day yesterday, this rise was short-lived and the BTC price fell below $80,000. The decline in BTC also affected altcoins, with Ethereum (ETH) down 8%; XRP down 4%; Solana (SOL) down 3.8%; and Dogecoin (DOGE) down 8.4% in the last 24 hours. While the downward trend continues in the US stock markets as well as in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, it is evaluated that the decline is related to the pullback in the US stock markets. At this point, Anthony Pompliano, CEO of Professional Capital Management, claimed that US President Donald Trump and his administration deliberately caused the stock market crash. Pompliano stated that Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent knowingly caused the stock market crash and tried to deliberately collapse asset prices, and claimed that they forced the FED to lower interest rates. “Trump and his team are deliberately crashing the market. Is this a master plan or are we watching uncontrolled destruction? “If the Fed lowers interest rates in response to this market decline, the Trump administration could avoid nearly $7 trillion in debt. That's why Trump and his team have deliberately talked about imposing tariffs and significantly lowered the yield on the 10-year Treasury note in order to create favorable conditions for the bond market.” While the issue of Trump intentionally causing the decline remains an allegation for now, Pompliano also recalled Trump's words in an interview: “Nobody gets rich when interest rates are high, because people can't borrow money.” Whether or not Pompliano’s claims are true, U.S. stock markets have been in a slump lately, and cryptocurrencies are being hit even harder. At this point, while 'recession fear' dominated the US stock markets yesterday, Nasdaq (-4%), S&P 500 (-2.70%) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (-2.08%) closed with declines. The cryptocurrency market was more affected by this decline, with major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (-2%), Ethereum (-8%) and XRP (-4%) experiencing significant declines. *This is not investment advice.

The XRP lawsuit has created growing anxiety within the crypto community, with many fearing a delay in its resolution. Despite the SEC dismissing other crypto cases, there is significant debate over the XRP outcome. Though SEC has taken down the XRP lawsuit from the site, there is no official confirmation yet on whether they are dismissing the case or not. With increasing speculation around a potential settlement, attorney Fred Rispoli has pointed to a key date—April 16—as a possible turning point for the case. While uncertainty remains, legal experts are weighing in on when and how this lawsuit could finally conclude. Will the XRP Case End Before April? Fred Rispoli believes the case will see a significant development before Ripple submits its appellate brief on April 16. While there’s no official requirement for the case to wrap up by then, Rispoli remains optimistic, urging XRP supporters to keep an eye on the timeline. Adding to the speculation, legal expert MetaLawMan echoed Rispoli’s view, also predicting a resolution before mid-April. However, some remain skeptical, warning that delays could still push the case further into the year. A Settlement Before September, or Will it Drag On Further? Despite growing optimism, legal hurdles remain. Jeremy Hogan and MetaLawMan caution that factors like Judge Torres’s injunction and Ripple’s $125 million penalty could delay the final verdict. Some investors believe the SEC may even drop its appeal by March, speeding up the process, but nothing is set in stone. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : How High XRP Price Will Go In 2025? Expert Insights & Market Trends , Even Ripoli thinks that the holdup is likely due to the $125M judgment, which is a significant factor that could be causing delays in resolving the situation. While many expect the lawsuit to end soon, the possibility of delays lingers. Even if an April resolution doesn’t happen, the community remains hopeful that an outcome will be reached before September. Matt Hougan believes the XRP market will surge once the Ripple v. SEC case is settled, as years of legal pressure have suppressed its true potential. As anticipation builds, XRP holders are closely watching how the SEC will proceed in the coming weeks. XRP surges to $2.25 on Mar 10, 2025, up 5%, fueled by optimism over potential SEC lawsuit resolution rumors this month. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Consequently, total assets under management (AUM) have declined by $39 billion to $142 billion — the lowest level since mid-November 2024. Bitcoin (BTC) ETPs were the primary contributors to the outflows, accounting for $756 million. Ethereum (ETH) ETPs followed with $89.2 million. Notably, short-Bitcoin ETPs also experienced outflows of $19.8 million, the most significant since December 2024.

Many cryptocurrencies underperformed in February as Bitcoin tanked below $80,000. As March kicks off, however, the smart money isn’t moved—in fact, whales are going large on the best altcoins to snap up at a discount. This kind of whale accumulation happens before top altcoins begin to rally. That’s also why retail investors monitor whale purchases as the latter buy altcoins. And, based on recent market trends, the smart money is loading up big-time on these five picks as the best altcoins to buy ahead of Q2. Best altcoins to invest in ahead of Q2: The picks It can be tricky keeping tabs on up-and-coming altcoins to watch. But we’ve got you covered with the top altcoins to buy as Q2 heats up. Here are the top 5 altcoins primed to pop in Q2: Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) Raydium (RAY) Mantra (OM) SUI (SUI) KAITO (KAITO) Bitcoin Pepe: Best presale altcoin on the board in Q2 Don’t let the name fool you. Bitcoin Pepe isn’t just another low-effort PEPE derivative. On the contrary, Bitcoin Pepe is creating what the project calls Solana on Bitcoin—a game-changing Layer-2 scalability solution combining the throughput of Solana with the security of Bitcoin. Beyond the intriguing name and the frog-themed branding, Bitcoin Pepe is focused on creating what could be the key to unleashing the trillions in idle liquidity on the Bitcoin blockchain. The goal? To create a meme-centric L2 poised to funnel trillions into the meme coin sector and create one right on top of the world’s richest and most established blockchain. Bitcoin Pepe will serve as the core infrastructure that makes Bitcoin’s massive capitalization usable for meme coin trading. The implications are exciting indeed—and smart money has taken notice. With its presale having raised a massive $4.2m since launching, it’s easy to see why pundits predict Bitcoin Pepe and its native token BPEP to go on a parabolic run once its presale ends and it lists on exchanges in Q2 2025. The best part? You’re still early to the show—and early adopters will be in line for impressive rewards. At each presale stage, BPEP will increase by 5%. That means the earlier you buy in, the higher the guaranteed gains will be until the inevitable moon when it lists. Earliest adopters are already priced in for a 300% profit before BPEP lists. And the window to get in at the favorable price point of $0.0268 is rapidly closing as its Q2 listing draws ever so closer. Believe this—if Bitcoin Pepe succeeds in unlocking the fullest potential of Bitcoin as the world’s largest meme coin casino, the crypto world might be looking at the next 1000x gem. To learn more and to buy Bitcoin Pepe, check out the official website . Raydium (RAY): Solid Solana ecosystem play Raydium is a turbocharged trading platform built on the Solana blockchain. It's a decentralized exchange (DEX) and an automated market maker (AMM) all rolled into one. Raydium allows users to swap tokens directly from their wallets without relying on a middleman—no banks, brokers, or hassle. It also offers a chance to earn passive income through yield farming. Liquidity providers will reap serious rewards. Its built-in efficiency makes it super popular in decentralized finance (DeFi), especially within the Solana ecosystem, making it a solid ecosystem play ahead of Q2. Mantra (OM): Carrying on strong Q1 performance into Q2 Mantra (OM) was hanging around the 1-4 cent range for over a year and a half, like the little engine that could. And seemingly out of nowhere, it shot up to $7. Manta’s run from a low-cap yet potential blue-chip coin to breaking into the top 20 cryptocurrencies is incredible. As a decentralized finance (DeFi) project, Mantra is about staking, lending, and creating cross-chain solutions. It’s like one-stop shopping for all your DeFi needs. A big part of Manta’s run can be attributed to the rising demand for tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). Investors are looking for more stable and safer bets when the market's feeling rocky, and RWAs provide just that. Plus, there’s been a lot of buzz around crypto tax policies. MANTRA's CEO, John Patrick Mullin, has mentioned that if the U.S. eliminates crypto capital gains taxes, those RWAs will become even more attractive to investors. Sui (SUI): Strong L1 pick for Q2 2025 Sui is a layer-1 blockchain but not your average platform. It has a cool, object-centric data model and uses the Move programming language—talk about a powerhouse combo! This design isn’t just for show; it’s built for Go. Sui’s scalability and throughput make smart contract development and execution a breeze. Since its ICO launch last May 2023, Sui has become one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap, with SUI token prices crushing it as they peaked at new all-time highs last January. Sui isn’t that far off, either—it’s well within striking distance of minting a new ATH when Q2 begins to heat up. Kaito (KAITO): InfoFi powerhouse primed to pump Kaito Token (KAITO), which dropped in February 2025, is on a mission to supercharge InfoFi—a platform similar to ChatGPT but for the crypto world. Think of it as an AI-powered search engine for all things Web3 and crypto. InfoFi pulls in data from everywhere: crypto podcasts, Crypto Twitter, Messari, Dune—you name it. If it's crypto-related, InfoFi’s got it covered. KAITO underpins this entire ecosystem. It powers the platform, drives incentives in the market, and serves as the backbone of governance. If you hold KAITO, you don’t just sit back and watch—it gives you a voice in the direction of the network. KAITO owners can step in and help guide how the AI-driven InfoFi platform distributes attention. Don’t sleep on Kaito—it could be one of the dark horses of Q2 2025. The final word These five altcoins are among the top candidates to pump in Q2 due to their fundamentals, narrative, hype, and community engagement. However, from an ROI standpoint, Bitcoin Pepe might be the best one of the bunch. Still available at just $0.0268 in its presale phase, BPEP has unlimited upside for growth—and it’s barely scratched the surface of its potential.

This move signals a significant shift in the regulatory landscape. Crypto analyst Zach Rector responded to the news with a remark: “SEC doing everything besides settling the XRP case. Saving the best for last.” Rector’s comment encapsulates the growing frustration and speculation within the crypto community regarding the SEC’s long-standing lawsuit against Ripple Labs and its native token, XRP. The case, which has dragged on for over three years, represents one of the most pivotal legal battles in the history of digital assets. With the SEC revising its stance on certain regulatory requirements, many are left wondering: Is a resolution to the XRP case finally on the horizon? https://twitter.com/ZachRector7/status/1899314375187431807 The SEC’s Policy Shift: A Change in Crypto Oversight? The SEC’s decision to stop mandating crypto firms register as trading systems marks a major shift from its historically stringent approach. The previous requirement placed immense pressure on crypto platforms, subjecting them to compliance frameworks that were argued to be ill-suited for decentralized technologies. While the exact reasoning behind this regulatory shift remains unclear, several possible factors are at play. Mounting legal challenges have forced the SEC to defend its enforcement actions against crypto companies in court, with judges often questioning its approach. Political and institutional pressure has also increased, as U.S. lawmakers and financial institutions push for clearer, more innovation-friendly regulations. The SEC may also be refining its strategy in response to traditional financial firms increasingly embracing cryptocurrency. This policy change suggests that the SEC is either reconsidering its enforcement strategy or strategically prioritizing specific cases. The Ripple-XRP Case: The SEC’s ‘Last Stand’? Ripple’s battle with the SEC has been one of the most closely watched legal proceedings in the crypto ecosystem. The case revolves around the SEC’s claim that Ripple conducted an unregistered securities offering by selling XRP. On the other hand, Ripple maintains that XRP should not be classified as a security and that the SEC failed to provide clear regulatory guidance. So far, Ripple has secured several legal victories, including a landmark ruling by Judge Analisa Torres in July 2023 , which declared that XRP sales on secondary markets do not constitute securities transactions. Despite these developments, key issues remain unresolved, including potential penalties and a final settlement. With the SEC now relaxing its stance on crypto trading platforms, some speculate that the agency may be preparing to bring the Ripple case to a close finally . https://twitter.com/TimesTabloid1/status/1680250907504656385 What a Settlement or Final Ruling Could Mean for XRP and Crypto If the SEC settles or loses the case, the implications for XRP and the broader crypto market could be profound. A favorable outcome would remove uncertainty surrounding XRP’s status, allowing it to be relisted on major U.S. exchanges and increasing investor confidence. The case’s resolution could also set a legal precedent for how other cryptocurrencies are classified and regulated in the U.S. The market impact of the case’s outcome cannot be understated. A decisive victory for Ripple could trigger a surge in XRP’s price and reinforce crypto’s legitimacy in the eyes of institutional investors. Conversely, a harsh ruling against Ripple could empower the SEC to intensify enforcement actions against other crypto firms. The SEC’s latest policy adjustment raises important questions about its broader regulatory strategy. While the agency appears to be softening its stance on crypto trading platforms, it continues to delay the resolution of its most high-profile case. Whether this is a calculated move to buy time, a sign of internal reconsideration, or a prelude to a final XRP case settlement remains to be seen. As the crypto industry awaits the next development, one thing is certain: The Ripple vs. SEC case is more than just a legal battle—it is a defining moment in the ongoing struggle to establish clear and fair regulations for digital assets. And if Zach Rector’s comment is any indication, the grand finale might be just around the corner. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

XRP Price Holds Above $2 Despite $1 Billion Liquidations,https://coingape.com/markets/should-you-buy-xrp-here-xrp-price-holds-above-2-despite-1-billion-liquidations/,"XRP price briefly dropped below $2 yesterday after the crypto market crashed, wiping out nearly $1 billion in total liquidations. Ripple (XRP) has since recovered above $2, but as selling activity remains strong, investors remain anxious about whether now is the right time to buy XRP. Ripple price today trades at $2.09 after a 4% decline in 24 hours with an intra-day low of $1.92. XRP Price Holds Above $2 Amid Surging Liquidations XRP price has been holding levels above $2 despite the crypto market crashing . However, rising long liquidations have exerted additional sell-side pressure on the price. Data from Coinglass shows that in the last 24 hours, more than $37M in long positions on XRP were liquidated. XRP’s liquidation map further shows that if the XRP price were to fall below $2 again and breach its multi-month support level of $1.95, more than $62M of open long positions would be liquidated, causing another long squeeze. XRP Liquidation Map Besides this looming liquidation risk, concerns also emerged after a whale address moved over 167M XRP tokens during the crash. This transfer sparked fears of a looming sell-off that may push the XRP price lower. XRP Head and Shoulders Pattern Emerges – Time to Buy Ripple? XRP price has established support at $1.95, a level that it has defended multiple times. Buyers have consistently stepped in at this price, which also happened yesterday, forcing Ripple to move back above $2. As long as this support level holds, Ripple still has a chance meet its bullish XRP price prediction target. However, a bearish head and shoulders pattern has emerged on Ripple’s one-day chart. This pattern hints at a trend reversal from bullish to bearish. The neckline of this pattern is at the critical support of $1.95. If buyers fail to defend this level and XRP price falls below the 200-day SMA of $0.87, it could see a steep decline that is equal to the height of this pattern. This will cause the price to fall to $0.50. Such a steep decline will wipe out all the gains made in late 2024. The MACD shows a bearish momentum as this line falls further in the negative region. The MACD histogram bars also show that the selling pressure is strong, which also shows a grim outlook. XRP/USD: 1-day Chart As the downward pressure intensifies as the risk of more long liquidations still looms, there is a chance that the XRP price may once again drop to $1.95. If this resistance fails to hold firm, it could spark a steep price decline, making this not the right time to buy Ripple unless the broader crypto market sentiment changes.

Traders are looking for straws to clutch while concerns over a potential US recession and tariff disputes mount on global equities. Per data compiled by Bloomberg, South Korean investors purchased a net total of $189 million in Hong Kong equities last month. The buying spree has continued into March, setting up for the largest two-month net purchase of Hong Kong stocks since early 2021. The interest in Hong Kong equities spells a turnaround in sentiment after South Korean investors were presumably net sellers for the 2024 fiscal year. As reported by Cryptopolitan, the city’s benchmark Hang Seng Index has surged 18% this year, buoyed by strong demand from Chinese investors, who set a record for Hong Kong stock purchases on Monday. In the western part of the world, US stock market investors saw more than $1.1 trillion wiped away in the 24 hours leading up to yesterday’s close. Much of the blame for losses is being directed toward the Trump administration’s policies. Asian markets take a slide on US economic scares The sell-off in US markets has spilled into Asia, with stock indexes across the region sinking even more deeper in the early trading hours of Tuesday. “ Asian markets follow Wall Street’s weak lead with a broad-based decline across the region ,” said Kyle Rodda, a senior economist at Capital.com in Melbourne. “ Event risk is relatively limited today, with price action likely to reflect the recessionary risks building in the United States. ” The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell as much as 2.1%, hitting a five-week low before reducing its losses to 1.5%. Japan’s Nikkei 225 dropped nearly 3% in early trading before trimming some of its losses, and is now down 0.6%. South Korea’s KOSPI slid as much as 2%, while Taiwan’s TAIEX fell nearly 3% at one point. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 dropped as much as 1.3%, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down less than 1%. Across the continent, technology stocks led the declines. Japan’s Sony and Hitachi both fell more than 4.5% in early trading, while SoftBank tumbled 4.4%. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the world’s largest contract chipmaker, and Apple supplier Foxconn both declined by more than 3%. In South Korea, Samsung Electronics saw its stock drop more than 2%. US stocks plunge, erasing post-Trump election gains Of the biggest losers in the bunch is Wall Street, who arguably have more reasons to be angry at Trump than global markets. Tuesday’s pre-market trading data shows the Nasdaq Composite suffered its worst single-day decline since September 2022. “Why did you vote for Trump?” “Because he’s better for the economy!” “But…Trump crashed the economy and Biden stepped in and doubled it in four years” “Hahaha fake news! Watch what Trump does to make things better!” The economy in Trump’s first month: 😑 #stockmarketcrash pic.twitter.com/tnxl6XVP74 — Skunk Factory (@skankyskunk47) March 10, 2025 The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average are also seeing red flashes, both recording over 2.5% losses today. On Monday, the Dow tumbled 890 points, a 2.08% drop, while the S&P 500 plummeted 2.7%. The Nasdaq, heavily weighted toward technology stocks, plunged 4%, dragged down by Tesla, whose stock has shockingly shed over 15% in the last day. The latest downturn has erased all gains made by the three major US stock indexes since Donald Trump won the presidential election in November last year. Market sentiment has been rattled by the US’s trade standoff with other countries, exacerbated by Trump’s tariff policies and growing fears of an incoming recession. According to CNN, Delta Air Lines revised its earnings forecast downward on Monday, because of “a decline in consumer and corporate confidence.” The airline said America has a weakening market optimism. Businesses could be waiting to see what the outcome of Trump’s “transitional period” will breed. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

13347278,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/defi-yield-farming-explained,1741686300,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/cointelegraph/eOeg3a00800.jpeg,What is yield farming in decentralized finance (DeFi)?,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/defi-yield-farming-explained?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"What is yield farming? Yield farming, also known as liquidity mining, is a decentralized finance (DeFi) strategy where cryptocurrency holders lend or stake their assets in various DeFi protocols to earn rewards. These rewards often come in the form of additional tokens, interest or a share of transaction fees generated by the platform. In the yield farming ecosystem, individuals known as liquidity providers (LPs) supply their assets to liquidity pools, smart contracts that facilitate trading, lending or borrowing on DeFi platforms . By contributing to these pools, LPs enable the smooth operation of decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and lending platforms. In return for their participation, LPs earn rewards, which may include: Transaction fees: A portion of the fees generated from trades or transactions within the pool. Interest payments: Earnings from lending assets to borrowers. Governance tokens: Native tokens of the platform that often grant voting rights on protocol decisions and can appreciate in value. Key components of yield farming Liquidity pools: These are collections of funds locked in smart contracts that provide liquidity for decentralized trading, lending or other financial services. Users deposit their assets into these pools, enabling various DeFi functions. Automated market makers (AMMs): AMMs are protocols that use algorithms to price assets within liquidity pools, allowing for automated and permissionless trading without the need for a traditional order book. Governance tokens: Tokens distributed to users as rewards for participating in the protocol. These tokens often grant holders the right to vote on changes to the protocol, influencing its future direction. Yield farming vs. traditional financial yield mechanisms Yield farming in DeFi differs significantly from traditional financial yield mechanisms: Accessibility: DeFi platforms are typically open to anyone with an internet connection, removing barriers associated with traditional banking systems. Potential returns: While traditional savings accounts offer relatively low interest rates, yield farming can provide substantially higher returns. However, these higher yields come with increased risks, including market volatility and smart contract vulnerabilities. Intermediaries: Traditional finance relies on centralized institutions to manage funds and transactions. In contrast, DeFi operates on decentralized protocols, reducing the need for intermediaries and allowing users to retain control over their assets. Is yield farming profitable in 2025? As of February 2025, yield farming remains a profitable strategy, though it is less lucrative than in previous years due to reduced token incentives and heightened competition among liquidity providers. That being said, the DeFi sector continues to expand rapidly, with the total value locked (TVL) reaching $129 billion in January 2025, reflecting a 137% year-over-year increase. Projections suggest that this figure could escalate to over $200 billion by the end of 2025, driven by advancements in liquid staking, decentralized lending and stablecoins. This growth, fueled by innovations in liquid staking, decentralized lending and stablecoins, is creating new and potentially lucrative yield farming opportunities. Moreover, the macroeconomic environment plays a crucial role in shaping DeFi yields. In 2024, the US Federal Reserve implemented rate cuts, lowering its policy rate by half a percentage point for the first time in four years. This monetary easing has historically increased the attractiveness of DeFi platforms, as lower traditional savings rates drive investors toward alternative high-yield opportunities. As a result, despite overall yield compression, some DeFi platforms still offer double-digit annual percentage yields (APYs) , far surpassing traditional financial instruments. However, note that yield farming isn’t just about earning passive income — it’s a cycle of reinvesting rewards to maximize gains. Farmers earn tokens as rewards and often reinvest them into new liquidity pools, creating a fast-moving loop of capital flow or token velocity. This cycle helps DeFi grow by keeping liquidity high, but it also introduces risks. If new users stop adding funds, some farming schemes can collapse like a Ponzi structure, relying more on fresh liquidity than on real value creation. How does yield farming work? Embarking on yield farming within the DeFi ecosystem can be a lucrative endeavor. This step-by-step guide will assist you in navigating the process, from selecting a platform to implementing effective risk management strategies. Step 1: Choosing a platform Selecting the right DeFi platform is crucial for a successful yield farming experience. Established platforms such as Aave, Uniswap and Compound are often recommended due to their reliability and user-friendly interfaces. Additionally, platforms such as Curve Finance, which specializes in stablecoin trading with low fees and minimal slippage, and PancakeSwap, operating on the BNB Smart Chain (BSC) , which offers lower transaction fees and a variety of yield farming opportunities, are also worth considering. Step 2: Selecting a liquidity pool When selecting a liquidity pool for yield farming, it’s essential to evaluate the tokens involved, the pool’s historical performance and the platform’s credibility to mitigate risks, such as impermanent loss, which will be discussed later in this article. Did you know? Annual percentage yield (APY) accounts for compounding interest, reflecting the total amount of interest earned over a year, including interest on interest, while annual percentage rate (APR) denotes the annual return without considering compounding. Step 3: Staking and farming tokens — How to deposit and withdraw funds Engaging in yield farming involves depositing (staking) and withdrawing funds: Depositing funds: Connect your wallet: Use a compatible cryptocurrency wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to connect to the chosen DeFi platform. Select the liquidity pool: Choose the desired pool and review its terms. Approve the transaction: Authorize the platform to access your tokens. Supply liquidity: Deposit the required tokens into the pool. Withdrawing funds: Navigate to the pool: Access the pool where your funds are staked. Initiate withdrawal: Specify the amount to withdraw and confirm the transaction. Confirm the transaction: Approve the transaction in your wallet to receive your tokens back. Step 4: Risk management tips Mitigating risks is essential in yield farming: Stablecoin pools: Participating in pools that involve stablecoins like Tether’s USDt ( USDT ) and USD Coin ( USDC ) to reduce exposure to market volatility. Diversification: Spread investments across multiple pools and platforms to minimize potential losses. Research and due diligence: Investigate the security measures, audits and reputation of platforms before committing funds. DeFi yield farming calculator: How to estimate returns Yield farming calculators estimate returns by factoring in capital supplied, fees earned and token rewards, with several tools aiding projections. To accurately estimate potential returns in yield farming, calculators require inputs such as the amount of capital supplied to a liquidity pool (liquidity provided), the portion of transaction fees distributed to liquidity providers (fees earned) and any additional incentives or tokens granted by the protocol (token rewards). By inputting these variables, calculators can project potential earnings over a specified period. Several platforms provide tools to assist in estimating DeFi yields: DefiLlama: Offers comprehensive analytics on various DeFi protocols, including yield farming opportunities. Zapper: Allows users to manage and track their DeFi investments, providing insights into potential returns. Yieldwatch: A dashboard that monitors yield farming and staking, offering real-time data on earnings. CoinGecko’s APY calculator: Breaks down annual percentage yield across different timeframes, helping estimate earnings based on principal and APY percentage. Did you know? In yield farming, frequent compounding boosts returns. Manual compounding requires reinvesting earnings, while automated compounding reinvests them for you. The more often it happens, the higher your APY. Understanding impermanent loss in yield farming Impermanent loss occurs when the value of assets deposited into a liquidity pool changes compared to their value if held outside the pool. This phenomenon arises due to price fluctuations between paired assets, leading to a potential shortfall in returns for LPs. The loss is termed “impermanent” because it remains unrealized until the assets are withdrawn; if asset prices revert to their original state, the loss can diminish or disappear. In AMM protocols, liquidity pools maintain a constant ratio between paired assets. When the price of one asset shifts significantly relative to the other, arbitrage traders exploit these discrepancies, adjusting the pool’s composition. This rebalancing can result in LPs holding a different proportion of assets than initially deposited, potentially leading to impermanent loss. Consider an LP who deposits 1 Ether ( ETH ) and 2,000 Dai ( DAI ) into a liquidity pool, with 1 ETH valued at 2,000 DAI at the time of deposit. If the price of ETH increases to 3,000 DAI, arbitrage activities will adjust the pool’s balance. Upon withdrawing, the LP might receive less ETH and more DAI, and the total value could be less than if the assets were simply held, illustrating impermanent loss. For detailed strategies on managing impermanent loss, refer to Step 4 of card 3 in this article. The future of yield farming The early days of sky-high, unsustainable returns fueled by inflationary token rewards are fading. Instead, DeFi is evolving toward more sustainable models, integrating AI-driven strategies, regulatory shifts and crosschain innovations. 1. Real yield replaces inflationary rewards DeFi is moving away from token emissions and toward real yield — rewards are generated from actual platform revenue like trading fees and lending interest. In 2024, this shift was clear: 77% of DeFi yields came from real fee revenue, amounting to over $6 billion. 2. AI-driven DeFi strategies AI is becoming a game-changer in yield farming. DeFi protocols now use AI to optimize strategies , assess risks, and execute trades with minimal human input. Smart contracts powered by AI can adjust lending rates in real-time or shift funds between liquidity pools for maximum efficiency. 3. Regulations With DeFi’s expansion, regulatory scrutiny is ramping up. Governments are pushing for frameworks to protect investors and prevent illicit activities. While increased oversight might add compliance hurdles, it could also attract institutional players, bringing more liquidity and legitimacy to the space. 4. Crosschain yield farming Single-chain ecosystems have limited features. Crosschain yield farming and interoperability solutions are breaking down barriers, allowing users to move assets seamlessly across blockchains. This opens up more farming opportunities and reduces reliance on any single network’s liquidity. What’s next? Several emerging trends are reshaping yield farming. Liquid staking lets users stake assets while still using them in DeFi. Automated vaults simplify farming by dynamically shifting funds for optimized returns. Decentralized index funds offer exposure to multiple assets through a single token, reducing risk while maintaining yield potential. In short, yield farming is becoming more sophisticated, sustainable and interconnected. The days of easy money are gone, but the opportunities for smart, long-term strategies are only getting better. Yield farming vs staking: Key differences The primary distinction between yield farming and staking is that the former necessitates consumers depositing their cryptocurrency cash on DeFi platforms while the latter mandates investors put their money into the blockchain to help validate transactions and blocks. Yield farming necessitates a well-considered investment strategy. It's not as simple as staking, but it can result in significantly higher payouts of up to 100%. Staking has a predetermined reward, which is stated as an annual percentage yield. Usually, it is approximately 5%; however, it might be more significant depending on the staking token and technique. The liquidity pool determines the yield farming rates or rewards, which might alter as the token's price changes. Validators who assist the blockchain establish consensus and generate new blocks are rewarded with staking incentives. Yield farming is based on DeFi protocols and smart contracts , which hackers can exploit if the programming is done incorrectly. However, staking tokens have a tight policy that is directly linked to the consensus of the blockchain. Bad actors who try to deceive the system risk losing their money. Because of the unpredictable pricing of digital assets, yield farmers are susceptible to some risks. When your funds are trapped in a liquidity pool, you will experience an impermanent loss if the token ratio is unequal. In other words, you will suffer an impermanent loss if the price of your token changes when it is in the liquidity pool. When you stake crypto, there is no impermanent loss. Users are not required to lock up their funds for a set time when using yield farming. However, in staking, users are required to stake their funds for a set period on various blockchain networks. A minimum sum is also required in some cases. The summary of the differences between yield farming and staking is discussed in the table below: Is yield farming safe? Every crypto investor should be aware of the risks, including liquidation, control and price risk related to yield farming. Liquidation risk occurs when the value of your collateral falls below the value of your loan, resulting in a liquidation penalty on your collateral. When the value of your collateral diminishes or the cost of your loan rises, you may face liquidation. The difficulty with yield farming is that small-fund participants may be at risk because large-fund founders and investors have greater control over the protocol than small-fund investors. In terms of yield farming, the price risk, such as a loan, is a significant barrier. Assume the collateral's price falls below a certain level. Before the borrower has an opportunity to repay the debt, the platform will liquidate him. Nevertheless, yield farming is still one of the most risk-free ways to earn free cash. All you have to do now is keep the above mentioned risks in mind and design a strategy to address them. You will be able to better manage your funds if you take a practical approach rather than a wholly optimistic one, making the project worthwhile. If you have a pessimistic view of yield farming, on the other hand, you'll almost certainly miss out on a rich earning opportunity.",Altcoin|DeFi|Investments|Yield farming,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|TRADING|MINING|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-03-11 09:45:00

However, Durag Doge’s ($DURAG) presale has become the talk of the crypto town because the new meme coin is going through the roof since it’s more of a cultural icon because it combines the hustle characterizing street life with the fun and innovation of meme coins. How Durag Doge is Building a Legacy Having failed to defend the significant support level of $200, and consequently witnessing a drop to $195, Solana’s woes have been skyrocketing. As Solana’s fire dwindles, Durag Doge is igniting a cultural shift, showcasing it as one of the best altcoins for the next bull run. This is because $DURAG is a deflationary token that blends speculative thrill with community-driven substance, making it the best crypto to buy now. By being significant trendsetters, meme coins can no longer be put into oblivion in the finance market. As a result, Durag Doge is taking the game a notch higher by offering staking rewards with up to 20% APY, showcasing it as one of the good crypto investments. Why Durag Doge Embodies a Cutting-Edge Vision Hovering on shaky grounds of $0.25, Dogecoin might nosedive further if this support area does not hold. DOGE has been in the red to the extent that a 23.1% decline has been recorded in the last seven days to hit $0.2548. On the other hand, Durag Doge has already set the ball rolling as a force to be reckoned with because not only does it represent influence, but also what the future of meme coins ought to look like. As a cultural phenomenon that is all about dominance, hustle, and street culture, $DURAG has already set the ball rolling as the freshest meme coin that does not shy away from fashion. With each $DURAG priced at 0.0009 USDT, the fear of missing out (FOMO) has already started to set in with experts speculating that it will be the next big thing. Its friendly no buy or sell tax policy cannot be ignored since its primary objective is driving crypto adoption. Conclusion With Solana and Dogecoin finding themselves in the red, Durag Doge is witnessing heightened investor interest and confidence with its presale painting a bullish picture.

Eyes on June,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/what-to-expect-in-fed-interest-rates-after-recent-developments-eyes-on-june/,"The Federal Reserve is unlikely to cut interest rates at its policy meeting next week, but if recession fears intensify, a series of rapid rate cuts could begin as early as June, according to institutional analysts. Market expectations for rate cuts have risen as futures contracts increasingly price in 25 basis point cuts in June, July and October. The trend follows comments from US President Donald Trump over the weekend about a “transition period” as he moves forward with tariffs on multiple countries. Short-term interest rate traders have moved their estimates that the Fed will begin cutting rates from May to June, but they still predict a total of three cuts in 2025. Related News: What Will Happen to Solana (SOL)? March Predictions Are In! U.S. stocks and Treasury yields fell yesterday as concerns grew that Trump's remarks signaled a coming economic downturn. “Despite the apparent calm, policymakers will become increasingly concerned about the rising risks to dual duty if labor or financial markets start to fall before the Fed has time to assess the impact of tariffs and the entire Trump agenda on inflation,” Tim Duy, chief U.S. economist at SGH Macro Advisors, said in a note. Duy warned that a slow response from the Fed could draw a backlash from the Trump administration, which has been pushing for rate cuts. *This is not investment advice.

The announcement comes riding the heels of global pro-crypto ushers, such as a strategic BTC reserve in the U.S. and other global advancements. Deutsche Boerse’s Clearstream To Launch BTC, Ether Custody Services Soon According to a Bloomberg report on March 11, Deutsche Boerse’s post-trade unit Clearstream is planning to launch cryptocurrency settlement and custody services later this year. As per the announcement, these services will be offered only to institutional clients in Europe. Intriguingly, this decision by a key European financial institution indicates growing support for the digital asset class globally. Following recent pro-crypto developments in the U.S. and other nations, European entities are now forging efforts to not lag in the global race for tapping crypto’s potential. Global Push For Digital Asset Class Adoption On The Rise On the other hand, a stockpile of other pro-cryptocurrency developments unfolded across the broader sector recently. The U.S. has stolen the spotlight with its strategic Bitcoin reserve and crypto stockpile announcement, underscoring support for the digital asset class. Also, CoinGape reported that the Singapore Exchange (SGX) is eyeing Bitcoin futures contracts launch by this year, signaling growing support for cryptocurrencies. Additionally, Japan’s ruling party also made a regulatory proposal to bolster support for cryptos. The nation seeks to launch cryptocurrency-backed ETFs in an effort to not lag behind. Simultaneously, Deutsche Boerse’s Clearstream now joins the fray alongside vital pro-crypto advancements that underscore a paradigm shift in the market sentiment for cryptocurrencies. Pro-Crypto Advancements Fail To Uplift Prices However, despite the most bullish advancements witnessed in recent days, the crypto market continues to slump . Bitcoin (BTC) price hit a $76K low, whereas ETH, SOL, and XRP prices erased alarming values recently. This waning action is attributable to rising U.S. recession fears amid intense macro heat. In conclusion, the pro-crypto movers, such as Deutsche Boerse’s plans and the U.S. advancements, have failed to uplift the market sentiment. Traders and investors continue to stay on their toes despite major advancements due to broader turmoil.

Expert Insights & Market Trends appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency market does not look impressive right now. In the last 24 hours alone, the market cap has slipped by at least 4.4%. Almost all top cryptos have suffered declines during the same period. XRP is not an exception. It has recorded a drop of 2.3%. This month, the XRP market has reported two major corrections: an 18.6% decline on March 8 and a 22.12% drop between March 7 and 10. Currently, the XRP market is struggling to recover from these corrections. Right now, the XRP price is at least 18.49% below its March 7 level. However, a crypto analyst predicts that the XRP market could reach price peaks in 2025. Curious? Read on! XRP’s Potential 2025 Peak: Analyst’s Prediction According to EGRAG Crypto , the XRP market will reach its peak in either May 2025 or September 2025. It appears that the analyst is using past price movements of XRP from 2014 to 2018 as a guide. He notes that previous market cycles lasted either 1,492 days or 1,614 days. He states that if XRP follows the same patterns as it did in 2014-2018, then its next big peak will likely happen in mid-2025. Earlier, he predicted that the market would have a big price increase in July 2024. However, after further analysis of these historical patterns, he changed his prediction to the 2025 dates. Long-Term Price Target: The $27 Vision How high can the XRP market go? Interestingly, this crypto analyst reveals that he maintains a long-term target of $27 for XRP. In the past year, the XRP market has experienced a surge of no less than 241.2%. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and XRP Price Prediction Today , Current Market Challenges: XRP’s Struggle Below $2.2 At the start of 2025, the XRP price was at $2.0870.

Though, on the second day of the month, the XRP market experienced a steep growth of 34.21%, the two major corrections this month caused the market to drop below the opening price of March 2. Currently, the XRP price stands at $2.1298. Experts warn that if the XRP price fails to hold above $2.2, the market could suffer severe drops.

Traders are getting nervous with the fall in XRP too, with many turning to alternatives promising stability as well as real-world application. As ADA and XRP draw the spotlight, money is pouring in for Remittix (RTX) , a newly launched token which is changing the face of cross-border payments. Amidst rising uncertainty, forward-thinking investors are investing in RTX as a future-facing prospect in a changing economic environment. Remittix (RTX) is quickly turning out to be the new XRP, with experts predicting it will outperform Cardano (ADA) by the year 2025. Worth $0.0734, RTX has already made $13.8 million+ in revenue and sold 518 million+ tokens. While XRP struggles with volatility and ADA struggles to make inroads, Remittix is emerging as the most desirable option for cross border payments. Remittix (RTX): The Rising Star In Cross-Border Payments Unlike ADA, Remittix (RTX) is a remittances specialist in a global remittances market, which puts it in direct competition with XRP. By its real-time crypto-to-fiat payouts, Remittix is filling in the gaps of the traditional finance sector, which XRP dominated for so many years. Take a freelancer in India working for someone in Europe. Rather than waiting several days for money to be transferred by banks, Remittix (RTX) offers instant, low-cost transfers. This type of convenience is bringing in retail consumers alongside business consumers, just as XRP did in its early stages. As its market volume rises by 66.91% to $1.86B, investors look for other options as the market reverses. Remittix (RTX) is emerging as a suitable substitute, which is a welcome ADA substitute. ADA stands at $0.7336 , off by 5.29%, while XRP stands at $2.18, experts believe RTX’s PayFi business can revolutionize the financial technology sector. So, why should Remittix be any exception and why do experts believe it will take the upper hand over Cardano (ADA)? Source: Tradingview Could Remittix (RTX) Surpass Cardano (ADA)? Cardano (ADA) maintains a good reputation, though its recent price drop combined with slow adoption of real-world use cases have raised alarm. XRP, while still the leader in remittances, is plagued by regulatory problems. Remittix (RTX) is emerging as a regulatory-friendly, scalable answer natively incorporated into finance systems. Unlike ADA, which requires developers to come up with decentralized applications, RTX has a plug-and-play finance option easy for both users and companies. This ease of use has been the selling factor for investors, with RTX funding reaching over $13.8 million in a short while. If the adoption of ADA remains slow, it is likely Remittix (RTX) will surpass it in the year 2025. Investors looking for real-world utility are already turning to RTX, while the path for ADA towards mainstream adoption remains uncertain. The Future Of Global Transactions With RTX As digital finance evolves, XRP and Remittix (RTX) are leading the charge in lowering the cost of payment and speeding it up. While ADA continues its advancements in smart contracts, theirs is a different application than RTX’s straight-up monetary usage. Take, for instance, an African technology startup with the necessity of remitting workers globally. RTX makes the remitting instant, borderless, and affordable by eliminating expensive go-between agents. That is the reason why RTX is growing at a higher rate than purely speculative ventures such as ADA. While blockchain-based payments are being taken up by global companies, RTX can match up with ADA and XRP in the number of transactions. With its increasing success during the presale, experts believe RTX can revolutionize digital payments. Be part of the Remittix (RTX) movement While XRP and ADA fluctuate, investors are mainly focusing on Remittix (RTX) as a growth prospect. The crypto market is shifting, with RTX’s pragmatic approach to remittances leading it to be among the most promising tokens in 2025. Seeking an investment for the future? Get your hands-on experience with the Remittix presale today and see why experts think it will surpass ADA and XRP in the future.

This doubt increased interest in promising altcoins—projects that offer special benefits and are clear to use. One such project is the FXguys, a new funding program for trading combined with fresh DeFi staking rules. FXGuys Presale Explodes Past $4.5 Million — The Top PropFi Project of 2025 While some discuss Bitcoin’s future, FXGuys now stands as the best PropFi project, having collected over $4.5 million during its presale.

Speaking at the CERAWeek conference in Houston, he blamed rising inflation on nationalistic policies, including the deportation of workers, and said markets aren’t fully pricing in what’s coming. “I think if we all are becoming a little more nationalistic – and I’m not saying that’s a bad thing, you know, it does resonate with me – that it’s going to have elevated inflation,” Larry said. He pointed to mass deportations as a serious risk, especially for industries that depend on immigrant labor. Labor shortages and tariffs could drive costs higher Larry said the agriculture sector could struggle if large numbers of workers are deported, raising concerns about whether the country will have enough people to handle the workload. “Are we going to have enough workers to harvest this now?” he asked. It’s not just farming. Larry told members of Donald Trump’s team that the U.S. doesn’t have enough electricians to build the AI data centers needed for tech expansion. “We just don’t have enough,” he said, emphasizing that labor shortages will impact multiple industries. Beyond immigration, Larry also addressed the tariff policies being pushed by Trump’s administration. The government has been threatening to slap hefty tariffs on major trade partners, which industry leaders say will lead to higher import costs. “When I go to Washington, when they talk about these policies, at what cost are you willing to tolerate that?” he said, raising concerns about how much Americans are willing to pay for these economic decisions. Markets react as investors brace for uncertainty The stock market didn’t take the warnings lightly. On Tuesday morning, S&P 500 futures ticked up slightly after a sell-off on Monday that wiped out gains across the board. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average reversed earlier losses, climbing 0.3% (126 points), while Nasdaq 100 futures saw a small 0.14% increase. However, Nasdaq-100 futures stayed negative, dropping 0.15%. Some companies took a big hit. Delta Air Lines saw its stock tumble 11% after cutting its profit and sales forecast for the current quarter. The airline blamed weaker demand for U.S. travel, making it clear that rising costs and economic uncertainty are affecting consumer behavior. The broader market saw heavy losses on Monday, with the S&P 500 marking its third straight week of declines. The Nasdaq Composite had its worst day since September 2022, and the Dow sank nearly 900 points, closing below its 200-day moving average for the first time since November 1, 2023. Fears of a recession are creeping back into Wall Street. Trump, when asked about the economy during a Fox News interview on Sunday, described it as going through a “period of transition.” Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC on Friday that the economy could face a “detox period” as the administration cuts federal spending. Adding to the uncertainty, Goldman Sachs lowered its economic growth forecast, citing concerns over Trump’s tariff policy. The bank didn’t give an exact number, but analysts made it clear that higher trade barriers could slow down the economy. Investors focus on economic reports as Treasury yields slide This week’s economic reports could give investors a clearer picture of what’s ahead. Job openings data comes out Tuesday, followed by February’s consumer price index (CPI) on Wednesday morning and the producer price index (PPI) on Thursday. In the bond market, U.S. Treasury yields kept falling on Tuesday as investors moved toward safe havens. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield dropped 5 basis points, hitting 4.162% before rebounding slightly to 4.1865%. The 2-year Treasury yield slid to 3.829% before settling at 3.875%. Some of the biggest job losses in recent weeks came from Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which slashed thousands of jobs. But according to Barclays, this won’t change Federal Reserve policy. “In our view, the bar is high for DOGE-related job losses, in isolation, to alter the FOMC’s policy course in the next few meetings,” the bank said in a report. Barclays analysts argued that the workers laid off by Musk’s department have a wide range of skills and are scattered across the country. That means many of them will likely be absorbed into other sectors, minimizing any immediate economic impact. Tariff fatigue and market volatility continue Market instability isn’t going away anytime soon, according to Wolfe Research. In a note to clients, the firm warned that investors are dealing with “tariff fatigue”, as Trump’s policy shifts create confusion and market whiplash. “Investors are likely feeling ‘tariff fatigue’ as flip-flopping of policy and a barrage of news flow throughout last week has whipsawed markets,” wrote Chris Senyek, Wolfe’s chief investment strategist. He predicted that policy changes will continue but that volatility will remain the dominant trend. There’s still some optimism about the U.S. economy. Senyek pointed out that despite rising inflation and market downturns, the country’s wealthiest consumers are keeping spending levels high. “We continue to believe that the U.S. economy is still solid, on the back of the high-end consumer, which drives roughly 50% of overall spending,” he wrote. While stocks are down, Senyek described the market’s movement as a “typical drawdown”, with the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 down 10% and 7% from their highs. Technical indicators, he said, are signaling fear, but not a full-blown collapse. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

This sudden drop has caught many off guard, but it also presents a chance for new investments. Amidst the upheaval, five alternative cryptocurrencies are emerging as potential options. Delve into these coins that might shine despite the current market volatility. XYZVerse: The Best New Meme Project You Can’t Afford to Bench! XYZ is your exclusive VIP pass to a sports-driven, meme-fueled revolution.

XYZ presale is your first-quarter chance to get in before the mind-blowing explosion! Meme coins are the undisputed champions of the crypto world, and XYZ is set to crush the competition.

The first-mover advantage is key here—get in before the crowd storms the field, and you’ll be sitting on way bigger returns! XYZepe is fighting for glory—will you stand with him? Polkadot Holds Steady Amid Market Shifts, Eyes on Potential Upside Polkadot (DOT) has been trading between $3.58 and $4.85 recently. Over the past week, the price fell by nearly 20%, and it’s down about 9% for the month. Bears have been influential, pushing the price toward the support level at $3.14. However, the Relative Strength Index is around 51, indicating neutral momentum. The Stochastic oscillator is at 80.25, which suggests the asset may be approaching overbought conditions. If bullish sentiment picks up, DOT could move toward the resistance level at $5.68, which would be an increase of about 24% from current prices. Breaking past this point might lead to a rise toward the next resistance at $6.95, marking a potential gain of over 50%. The 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages are at $4.11 and $4.37, respectively. This shows that DOT is trading slightly below these averages but may rebound. As the crypto market looks forward to a possible bull run, many are watching DOT’s price movements closely. MANTRA (OM) Shows Mixed Signals Amid Market Volatility MANTRA (OM) has experienced fluctuations recently, with its price ranging between $5.45 and $7.43. Over the past week, the price dropped by 19.71%, but it managed a 2.05% gain over the past month. The 10-day simple moving average is $6.14, slightly below the 100-day average of $6.63. The relative strength index stands at 39.18, indicating the asset is nearing oversold territory. The stochastic oscillator at 38.22 further suggests a potential shift in momentum. Despite short-term declines, OM has surged by 482.80% in the last six months. If bullish momentum returns, the price could test the nearest resistance level at $8.68, offering a significant gain from current levels. Breaking through this barrier might propel the price toward the second resistance at $10.66. On the downside, the nearest support is at $4.73, which could act as a safety net if the price dips further. Traders are watching these key levels to gauge OM’s next move in the market. Pi Network Faces Bearish Trend as Price Tests Support Levels Pi Network (PI) has experienced a significant decline in its price recently. Over the past week, the price has dropped by 26.55%, and in the past month, it has plummeted by 96.81%. The current price ranges between $1.10 and $1.87, sitting below the 10-day simple moving average of $1.43 and the 100-day SMA of $1.70. The Relative Strength Index is at 42.40, indicating mild bearish momentum. The MACD level is negative at -0.0357, suggesting that bears are currently in control. The nearest support level is at $0.78, while the closest resistance is at $2.32. Despite the bearish trend, there is potential for a rebound if the price holds above the support level of $0.78. If bulls regain momentum and the price breaks through the first resistance level at $2.32, PI could aim for the second resistance at $3.09. This move would represent an increase of up to 65% from the current upper price range. However, if the price falls below the support level, it could decline towards the second support at $0.009100. Traders are watching to see if the price can break above the moving averages and shift momentum back to the bulls. Cardano (ADA) Poised for Growth Amid Upcoming Altcoin Season Cardano is currently trading between $0.56 and $1.03. In the past week, its price dropped by 34.95%, showing some bearish pressure. However, over the past month, it gained 4.53%, and in the last six months, it soared by 115.45%. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $0.73, below the 100-day average of $0.83, indicating a short-term downtrend. The Relative Strength Index is at 41.61, suggesting the asset is approaching oversold territory. The MACD level is negative at -0.0138, but the Stochastic indicator at 67.24 hints at potential upward momentum. As the altcoin season approaches, Cardano could see significant growth. The nearest resistance level is $1.33. If ADA breaks above this point, it may target the next resistance at $1.80. Moving from the current price to $1.80 would be an increase of over 75%. The nearest support level is at $0.40, which could provide a safety net against further declines. With these technical factors, Cardano has room to rise and may capitalize on the expected market bullishness.

The Nasdaq-listed company, which was active in the country several years ago, faced a number of issues due to regulatory pressure and eventually backed away from India. In 2022, it started operations in the country only to suspend them due to ""informal pressure"" from the Reserve Bank of India. The following year, the exchange shut off new user registration , while continuing to offer wallet services to Indian citizens. The FIU registration allows Coinbase to bring its trading services to the Indian market. Earlier this year, TechCrunch reported that Coinbase was in discussions with regulators, including the FIU, for a possible re-entry into India. The Brian Armstrong-led exchange said it plans to start up retail services this year, adding that it is also looking at releasing other products and increasing investment in the country. “India represents one of the most exciting market opportunities in the world today, and we’re proud to deepen our investment here in full compliance with local regulations,” said John O'Loghlen, regional managing director for APAC at Coinbase.",Finance|Coinbase|India|Regulation,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-11 10:00:00

Coinbase is all set to launch its initial retail offerings later this year. Future plans include introducing a broader range of investment products, further solidifying its presence in the region, as per the press release shared with CryptoNews. Coinbase Looks to Utilize India’s Immense Web3 Developer Pool “We’re committed to building in markets that believe in the potential of crypto and on-chain innovation,” stated John O’Loghlen, Regional Managing Director for APAC at Coinbase. “India represents one of the most exciting market opportunities in the world today, and we’re proud to deepen our investment here in full compliance with local regulations.” India’s transformation into a global technology powerhouse is evident in its vibrant startup ecosystem and rapid technological development. The country has emerged as a key on-chain hub, with its share of global developers increasing significantly over recent years. As a result, India now stands out among emerging markets, attracting interest from major players in the Web3 space. In addition to the FIU registration, Coinbase has reinforced its commitment to the Indian market. Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, was recently named to the Board of the U.S.-India Business Council (USIBC), highlighting the company’s intent to foster stronger commercial ties between the United States and India. Overseas Crypto Firms Continue to Register with FIU Coinbase is the latest firm to receive approval from India’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) to resume crypto services . In January 2024, the regulator had put a ban on all major foreign exchanges operating in the country.

The global ETF and mutual fund manager said the the ETF was designed to track the performance of Avalanche (AVAX). The company argued that the registration in Delaware on March 10 highlighted the surge in acceptance of digital currencies in the financial space. VanEck establishes the VanEck Avalanche ETF in Delaware BREAKING: VanEck just registered for an Avalanche ETF! This could indicate they may soon file for a spot $AVAX ETF. 👀 Major news for team dorito! 🔺 pic.twitter.com/s4KR0qwsTd — Kyle Willson (@KyleWillson) March 11, 2025 VanEck has announced that it has registered a spot Solana ETF in Delaware. The firm acknowledged that the Avalanche ETF was designed to track the performance of Avalanche (AVAX) that is recognized for its high throughput and low transaction fees. “This step reinforces growing institutional interest in AVAX and could pave the way for its broader adoption.” – Colony Labs . The fund manager believes that the registration of the ETF signified a notable advancement in the integration of digital assets into traditional financial markets in 2025. Avalanche and its virtual currency AVAX have previously attracted investors in the crypto space due to its innovative consensus mechanism that provide high transaction speeds and scalability solutions. VanEck highlighted that the registration of its Avalanche ETF came when regulatory clarity around cryptocurrencies was becoming necessary for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC has been reviewing proposals for more crypto investment products since the launch of Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. The firm said that the Delaware registration suggested that the crypto regulatory landscape may be shifting towards greater acceptance in 2025. The SEC’s Chairman Mark Uyeda showed willingness to consider abandoning proposed regulations that could stall the development of the digital asset industry. The Avalanche blockchain has been praised for managing around 4,500 transactions per second, which is a viable option for decentralized applications (dApps). VanEck acknowledged that the registration of its Avalanche ETF will drive more development and adoption in institutional investors to the Avalanche ecosystem. The fund manager acknowledged that the ETF will also provide investors with a regulated and accessible way to gain exposure to the Avalanche blockchain. The firm is confident that more adoption of Avalanche could lead to increased liquidity and stability in the virtual currency market. Solana (SOL) has continued plummeting in price in the wake of the market sell-off following Trump’s “not that much interesting” crypto reserve plan. SOL’s price is exchanging hands at $123.55 at the time of publication, down over 3% in the past 24 hours. Data from CoinMarketCap also revealed that the cryptocurrency currently has a market cap of $62.91 billion. Solana has dropped from its all-time high of $294.33 on January 19, declining over 60%. The drop in SOL also coincided with the recent decline in Bitcoin price, which plummeted below $80K and is currently trading at pre-U.S. election levels. VanEck has previously managed several digital asset-related ETFs, including products that track Bitcoin and Ethereum, and is often considered a pioneer in bringing virtual assets closer to institutional investors. Three VanEck officials resigns amid registration of ETF in Delaware The crypto community is awaiting further information from VanEck about the company’s plans for the deployment of the Avalanche ETF. They are also waiting to know how VanEck intends to position the Avalanche exchange-traded fund in the competitive crypto space. VanEck said that the success of the Avalanche ETF will depend on AVAX price volatility and the attitudes of the SEC towards crypto ETFs in the near future. Omer resigned from Avalanche Foundation director and Aytunc Yildizli and Vikram Nagrani also left the company last week. The firm’s executive director Aytnuc Yildizli stepped down from his duties on February 28, 2025, and the board has been looking for a way forward. Omer maintained that his resignation from Avalanche was deliberate and he would continue to focus on the development of the Avalanche ecosystem moving forward. Omer also acknowledged the hard work he had contributed to the crypto ecosystem and community since joining the foundation. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Franklin Templeton Reveals,https://coingape.com/how-can-the-bitcoin-reserve-help-the-us-economy-franklin-templeton-reveals/,"President Donald Trump’s executive order establishing the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve has generated significant excitement and interest. Adding to the positive momentum, asset manager Franklin Templeton endorses the United States’ Bitcoin reserve plans. He believes that the BTC reserve could boost the country’s economic growth. According to Franklin Templeton, the move marks a significant step for the Federal Government’s long-term financial stability. Let’s discover how the Bitcoin reserve could help the US mitigate its financial struggles. Franklin Templeton Endorses Bitcoin Reserve: Here’s Why In a recent X post , investment giant Franklin Templeton expressed its support for the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The asset manager posited that establishing a Bitcoin reserve could tackle the country’s economic worries. The company stated, “We see this move as supportive of the Federal Government’s long-term fiscal health, potentially helping to alleviate deficit concerns.” In addition, Franklin Templeton considers the development a landmark event in the history of Bitcoin. The asset manager believes that the US’ recognition of Bitcoin as a reserve asset highlights its value and legitimacy. Bitcoin Reserve to Boost BTC Adoption Notably, the strategic Bitcoin reserve is poised to have a significant impact on the global crypto ecosystem. Although bitcoin’s volatility and associated risks cannot be ignored, this move is a major milestone that is expected to usher in a new era of growth and adoption. Franklin Templeton pointed out that the BTC reserve would be seeded with approximately 200,000 BTCs, which have been obtained through criminal and civil forfeitures. This approach ensures that the initiative is self-funded, eliminating the need for taxpayer dollars. Furthermore, the Trump administration’s decision to holding these Bitcoins, rather than selling them, will bring stability to the market. Eliminating the risk of a large-scale BTC dump, investors can breathe a sigh of relief, and market confidence is likely to increase. Moreover, budget-neutral strategies to expand the reserve signifies that Bitcoin is being recognized as a legitimate store of value. This development could pave the way for further adoption by sovereign nations and institutional investors, cementing Bitcoin’s position as a mainstream asset class. Why Did US Crypto Reserve Fail to Spark BTC Price Growth? Bitwise Research Director Jeff Park, who has been repeatedly cautioning against the Bitcoin reserve plans, recently took to X to comment on the recent market downturn. Park stated, How the political theatre of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve mirage set us up for Bitcoin’s fastest drawdown, and why the real trade that wins next lies in regulated leverage on the most apolitically constrained commodity. Though the current market is experiencing the “fastest downturn” in Bitcoin’s history, it presents an opportunity for traders, stated Park. Currently, Bitcoin is valued at $81,358, marking a significant dip of 16% over the past 30 days. However, as Park hinted, traders are utilizing the dip, which is demonstrated by the increasing market momentum. BTC’s 24-hour trading volume surged by 48.9%, currently at $60.32 billion. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve: Diverse Sentiment Echoing Franklin Templeton’s positive sentiment, Bitcoin maxi Samson Mow shared his bullish anticipations on the potential of the strategic BTC reserve. Mow believes that the reserve could revolutionize the crypto market. Similarly, Solana founder Anatoly Yakovenko addressed the reserve as a “scalpel.” This suggests that the executive order’s regulatory approach appears to be tailored with precision and specificity, avoiding overly broad or restrictive measures. However, critics like Peter Schiff mocked at Trump’s reserve plans, sarcastically announcing the creation of his own BTC reserve. Though Schiff directly objected the altcoins reserves, he posited he could understand “the rationale for a Bitcoin reserve.” The post How Can the Bitcoin Reserve Help the US Economy?

Despite Donald Trump’s strategic Bitcoin reserve plans, BTC has failed to rise and is trading below $80,000. While the situation is not encouraging for altcoins either, the declines in the last 24 hours reached double digits. As the market crash continues, Offchain Labs, the research and development team behind Arbitrum, has announced its strategic ARB token acquisition plan. Ethereum layer-2 network Arbitrum developer Offchain Labs has announced that it has increased its stake in the ecosystem by acquiring ARB tokens for its treasury through a strategic acquisition plan in X. As part of the plan, Offchain Labs will acquire ARB tokens over time through open market and other transactions based on predefined parameters. However, the company did not provide exact details on how many ARBs it aims to acquire. The ARB price has fallen significantly over the past year. At this point, ARB is down 86% from its January 2024 peak of $2.39 and is down 54% since the beginning of the year. ARB, which has fallen 7.6% in the last 24 hours, continues to trade at around $0.33 at the time of writing. Despite this price drop, Arbitrum remains one of the top Layer 2 solutions on Ethereum with over $2.3 billion in total locked value. *This is not investment advice.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics is forecast to say headline inflation declined year-over-year to 2.9% from 3%, while core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, also lost 0.1 percentage point to 3.2%. Slower inflation raises the chance of an interest-rate cut, making riskier investments more attractive. CPI, which measures the cost of a basket of goods and services across the U.S. economy, has accelerated for four consecutive months. In the past few weeks, the S&P 500 has dropped almost 10% from its all-time high and bitcoin (BTC) has lost around 30% to around $80,000. Both Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent have emphasized the need for lower 10-year Treasury yields to bring down the federal funds rate. So far, this strategy appears to be working, with the 10-year yield falling to 4.2% from 4.8%, the dollar index (DXY) weakening below 104 and WTI crude oil stabilizing in the mid-$60 range — aligning with the administration's economic plans. Meanwhile, the Truflation Index has hit 1.35%, its lowest level since September 2020. However, five- and 10-year inflation expectations remain above 2%, indicating that Trump still has work to do in managing long-term inflation expectations. At the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on March 18-19, Chair Jerome Powell is expected to hold the federal funds rate steady at 4.25%-4.50%, according to the CME FedWatch Tool . Investors will be closely watching the inflation report, as a cooler-than-expected print could prompt the Federal Reserve to consider rate cuts. Conversely, a ""hot"" inflation reading would likely keep rates higher for longer and put further pressure on risk assets.",Markets|Bitcoin|Inflation|US|Economic data,EN,0,0,MARKET|BUSINESS|BTC|REGULATION|COMMODITY,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-11 10:07:24

How is Bitcoin coping in this environment? A staggering amount of debt to be refinanced A staggering amount of debt (around $34 trillion) needs to be refinanced by the U.S. government. A huge portion of this is financed through Treasury securities consisting of bonds, notes, and bills. These all need to be refinanced as and when they mature. The big factor that has to be borne in mind as this refinancing occurs, is interest rates. When bond yields are high, the cost of refinancing is also high. However, the inverse is also true. Therefore, wouldn’t the U.S. government have a vested interest in seeing the market come down? The thesis is that as investors flee crashing stocks, they will generally transfer their money into U.S. treasuries, thereby driving up bond prices, and conversely, bringing yields down. These lower yields will then make it a lot cheaper for the U.S. government to refinance its gargantuan debt. As things stand, the U.S. Treasury has around $8 trillion in short-term debt maturing in 2025 alone. As interest rates have risen since 2022, the cost of servicing the debt has become the biggest line item in the U.S. budget. This expense is forecast to hit $1 trillion in 2026, which will be more than the yearly amounts spent on defence or medicare. Could the S&P fall to $4,800? Source: TradingView The current stock market crash is already quite something. It has surpassed the Japanese carry trade crash of last August, and the more the price falls from here, the more difficult it will be for the bulls to regain the ascending channel. A measured move for this correction would be down to around $5,500. This isn’t that far now from the current price. The 200-day moving average has been lost, and therefore a more serious breakdown might be about to occur. $4,800 was the last major peak for the S&P 500, and this would also coincide with a rising 200-week moving average. Could the market fall this far? Breakout or another rejection for $BTC? Source: TradingView The short-term chart for Bitcoin shows that the price has bounced from the new local low of $76,800. Nevertheless, the price is now up against the local descending trendline, plus some horizontal resistance. The picture is clear. The price either breaks above the trendline and bulls are able to take the price higher, or another rejection occurs. The major bull market support is now not very far below. A reversal of the downtrend in sight? Source: TradingView Zooming further out into the daily chart, attention is drawn to the Relative Strength Index at the bottom. A clear descending channel has formed, with the indicator bouncing around within it. The last touch at the bottom trendline is the lowest descent since August 2023, perhaps this was a bottom. If so, the indicator line is more likely to break out of the top of the channel, possibly signalling a reversal of the downtrend. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The tech-heavy NASDAQ is down nearly 4%, just 8% away from entering the bear market territory. It has a strong correlation with Bitcoin, which is now trading below $78,000 at press time, down 28% from its all-time high. And yet, key charts indicate that the crypto bull market isn’t over and prices could now be forming their lows. Experts suggest that investors should already be DCAing into Bitcoin and high-upside altcoins for the next bull run. Here’s Why The Crypto Bull Run Isn’t Over The same key indicators and market experts who accurately predicted the current correction in Bitcoin and U.S. equities now signal an impending bullish reversal. Take, for instance, Fundstrat’s Tom Lee, a leading market expert who has historically been extremely accurate with his BTC projections. Earlier this year, Lee projected that Bitcoin could retrace to $62,000 by the end of March. However, he doesn’t view it as a bearish development but rather a strategic retracement before new all-time highs. Tom Lee believes that Bitcoin could hit $150,000 in 2025. Lee’s bullish thesis aligns with the Global M2 money supply , an indicator that has a strong correlation with BTC with a ~10-week lag. Considering the $4 trillion drawdown in Global M2 from September to December, analyst Joe Consorti believes that the Bitcoin price could fall to $70,000. However, global liquidity has already bottomed out and is now soaring. Some projections suggest that the global M2 could add over $4 trillion by the end of the Trump administration, suggesting that the crypto bull market is nowhere near its end. Similarly, GMI’s Head of Macro Research Julien Bittel reveals that financial conditions are easing rapidly, as indicated by the weakness in the US Dollar, Crude Oil and bond yields. Considering that GMI’s Financial Conditions Index shows extremely strong correlation with BTC, it suggests that crypto prices could start a bullish reversal in 2025 Q2. Finally, the key indicators that mark the Bitcoin cycle top aren’t suggesting the end of the bull market just yet. Take, for instance, the Pi Cycle Top indicator. Every time BTC’s 111-day Moving Average crosses the 350-day Moving Average times two, it indicates the Bitcoin top. Currently, there is a significant gap between the two averages, indicating there is considerable room for aggressive expansion in BTC. Here’s When To Buy The Dip There are several key support levels which could mark the bottom for Bitcoin. Tom Lee’s $62k and Joe Consorti’s $70,000 are two crucial ones. Bitcoin’s 50-week SMA and 50-week EMA also act as strong support levels—BTC has outperformed them since June 2023. Sidelined investors should DCA into BTC at each of these levels if the opportunity arises. Best Crypto To Buy The Dip Besides Bitcoin Bitcoin is an attractive investment and could rally to $150,000 in 2025, offering a clean 2x trade. However, the whales are also buying significant holdings of Dogecoin and Ethereum, expecting the popular crypto assets to perform well during a retail-dominated rally. The AI agent meta is also expected to make a comeback. For instance, AIXBT is an attractive investment, considering it is trading nearly 90% below its all-time high. Experts believe that Fartcoin and Goatseus Maximus are also undervalued at current levels. However, considering that Ethereum is expected to outperform Solana in the next bull run, ETH-based AI agent coins are also in high demand. For instance, Mind of Pepe (MIND) has quickly raised over $7 million in its ICO. The AI agent is designed to offer cutting-edge tips regarding the latest trends, whale activity, sentiment, and buy and sell signals to MIND holders. Considering this prominent ETH-based AI coin is still available at a small market cap, analysts are calling it the next 100x crypto.

At its intraday low, the cryptocurrency was trading for $1,755, its lowest price since October 2023. ETH/USD four-hour price chart. Source: TradingView Several factors appear to be contributing to ETH price losses, including: US recession fears and its overall impact on risk-on markets.

Ether price declines with risk-on assets Ether’s ongoing price drop mirrors similar declines in the broader risk-on market due to unfavorable macroeconomic conditions.

Source: TradingView JPMorgan raised US recession risk to 40% for 2025, up from 30%, citing US President Donald Trump’s ""extreme US policies"" as a key risk factor. Goldman Sachs also raised its 12-month recession probability to 20%, up from 15%. Earlier in March, Trump imposed 25% tariffs on all goods from Mexico and Canada, and 10% tariffs on Chinese imports. Canada and Mexico have announced intentions to impose retaliatory tariffs on US goods, escalating trade tensions and raising concerns about a potential trade war. Meanwhile, China has already retaliated by increasing tariffs on multiple US products and imposing export controls and investment restrictions on 25 US firms. These tariffs are expected to increase consumer prices and contribute to US inflation. US recession fears are impacting Ethereum and the crypto sector, notably: Ether, Bitcoin, and other top-ranking crypto assets have historically declined during periods of economic turbulences, e.g., the Covid-19 sell-off in March 2020 .

Reduced debt to $73.1 million while ETH’s price continued to decline. Liquidation level remained at $1,836 per ETH, closer to ETH’s current price above $1,900.

BTC fell over 3% to revisit the $76,000 mark. Similarly, ETH plunged by over 8% to hit the $1,700 zone, a level not seen since October 2023. The investors’ sentiment has now entered the “extreme fear” territory. The cumulative digital assets market cap declined by around 4% in the last 24 hours to stand at $2.64 trillion. This dip comes in as the Nasdaq 100 suffered its worst single-day drop since 2022. The index plunged by around 3.8% after US President Donald Trump warned of economic turbulence from trade wars with Canada, Mexico, and China. Charts suggest that the market hype is fading, and liquidity is tightening up. It seems like the retail traders have realized that the game ahead might be rigged. Crypto’s boom and bust cycle is back 10x Research in a report mentioned that there are several noticeable parallels emerging between the end of the last crypto bull market and the ongoing one. Every cycle sees many loud voices promising unlimited upside while the market print pumps. However, when things go south, the rhetoric quickly changes to volatility being a part of the game and investor patience. Investors have seen this movie before. In past cycles, hedge funds exploited the gap between DeFi and TradFi rates. Meanwhile, the game has now shifted to Bitcoin spots vs. future arbitrage. Tactics might have changed, but strategy remains the same. Such voices will extract maximum yield when the retail traders get rekt. It added that the market situation right now is turning out to be a macro Déjà Vu. The Fed had turned hawkish near Bitcoin’s peak in both 2017 and 2021. The same pattern is unfolding as the market hype is fading. BTC price is down by almost 13% on the year to date (YTD) and struggling to keep up despite recent bullish announcements. Despite the declaration of a crypto-linked strategic reserve, Bitcoin price dropped by 16% in the past 30 days. BTC is trading at an average price of $81,520 as of press time. It has declined by 25% from its all-time high of over $109K, recorded on January 20, 2025. In a similar fashion, Ripple’s XRP surged to become the second-largest crypto by market cap in 2017, only to fade by 2021. XRP saw a major price spike when the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) led lawsuit turned out to be partially in its favor. Since then, it has been juggling pumps and minor dumps. XRP price is down by 10% in the past 7 days, trading at an average price of $2.13. The largest altcoin has also endured its most devastating performance over the last bull runs. Ethereum price is down by 43% YTD. ETH has been bleeding out, leaving investors in a panic. ETH is trading at an average price of $1,919 as of press time. Trump’s crypto magic fading? For most of the months, Trump’s pro-crypto stance was a key driver behind Bitcoin’s massive rally to knock off fresh ATHs. On-chain data shows that whale accumulated and new BTC wallet creation exploded after his November 5 election win. Fast-forward to today, that excitement is getting a reality check. Despite Trump’s executive order to create a Bitcoin Reserve and Digital Asset Stockpile, the lack of active government BTC purchases has left the market unimpressed. Even last week’s White House Crypto Summit announcement did little to boost sentiment. The crypto market is now on a 7-week downtrend, but history shows this sector is built on boom-and-bust cycles. The question here remains, was Trump’s election the last major catalyst? Or are we just stuck in crypto Déjà Vu?

The market value of Shiba Inu currently ranges at $0.00013 while its community support helps advance its Shibarium ecosystem. Specialists maintain that the potential for massive profits from Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains lower than what new projects could offer. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) successfully thrives as an operation during this period. MUTM tokens proceed through their third presale stage at the current price of $0.02. Since its launch The project accumulated $3 million from 5100+ holders. Moving forward with MUTM purchases today will bring a minimum profit of 3 times the value when Mutuum Finance launches at $0.06 and represents potential 50 times returns if the token reaches $3 during 2025. Shiba Inu’s Resilience in a Changing Market The meme cryptocurrency Shiba Inu (SHIB) dominates the market through community support and its developing ecosystem including Shibarium. At its current $0.000013 price tag SHIB draws optimistic market predictions from its holders as they expect another substantial market increase. Some investors gravitate toward more profitable investment opportunities because the market now directs itself toward higher growth areas. The meme coin sector maintains Shiba Inu as an important participant while its long-term community continues showing steady interest and market demand. Mutuum Finance: Transforming DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance positions itself as an appealing investment option that draws strong support from investors. Mutuum Finance offers a new definition for decentralized finance by developing a next-generation dual-lending method consisting of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) technology. Smart contracts through the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model manage lending pools by accepting USDT stablecoins and issuing loans with ETH asset security. Users achieve complete ownership of confidential loan arrangements through Peer-to-Peer (P2P) since this model does not require intermediaries. The dual system achieves maximum security combined with adaptive operations while delivering profits through current APY rates reaching up to 10% for liquidity providers. Built for Security, Stability & Growth Mutuum Finance dedicates itself to security combined with transparency by conducting thorough third-party audits while deploying open-source smart contracts to establish trust. Platform stability improvements will come from launching a stablecoin backed by USD in addition to implementing fee-supported token buyback operations which will uphold price stability for the long term. Through the feature of staking rewards stakeholders receive incentives to maintain their liquidity which bolsters overall confidence within the ecosystem. The platform registers growing popularity because it has gained over 2,460 investors. Exclusive Early Investment Opportunity The Phase 3 presale opens an exceptional opportunity for people to buy MUTM tokens at the current price of $0.02. MUTM token prices will increase gradually from $0.02 to $0.06 through 11 price stages of the sale period allowing investors to attain 200% return before trading begins. The market experts believe MUTM tokens will reach the $1 milestone following its launch thus becoming one of the foremost DeFi tokens in 2025. During phase 4 investors can acquire MUTM tokens at $0.025 price level which delivers up to 75% instant profit to those who purchased in the initial stage and the current capital level has crossed $3 million. Mutuum Finance intends to boost adoption by running a $100,000 giveaway that will award 10 participants with $10,000 MUTM tokens each. A referral system provides more benefits to users who successfully connect new investors to the platform which speeds up the community growth rate and user interaction. Experts see Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as better than Shiba Inu (SHIB) for future value growth because of its devoted community base. During Phase 3 of its presale which runs at $0.02 per token MUTM has obtained more than $3 million from 5,100+ investors. The early investor buying opportunity delivers up to 3x return for the initial $0.06 price while the token has potential to generate 50x profits when reaching $3 by 2025.

Arthur Hayes’s Bitcoin price prediction of $75,000 gains credibility with market downturn. Bitcoin struggles to decouple from traditional markets, showing potential for short-term rebound. Worries about a recession sent markets tumbling, hitting both stocks and crypto. On Black Monday, U.S. stock indices took a dive : the Dow shed 2%, the S&P 500 dropped 2.7%, and the Nasdaq nosedived 4%. Major firms like Tesla, Apple, and Nvidia all took a beating, with Tesla falling sharply by 15.4%. At the same time, Bitcoin slipped below $80,000, its second dip in three weeks, rattling investor nerves. Hayes’ Bitcoin Prediction Looks More Likely Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, has been flagging potential market corrections, especially for Bitcoin, for some time. Hayes previously suggested Bitcoin might drop to $75,000, a forecast that now looks increasingly possible. Recent reports show Bitcoin actually hit a low of $81,380, getting closer to Hayes’s predicted price level.

The stock market has also plunged, reflecting fears over Trump’s tariff policies and broader economic instability. Analysts warn of slower economic growth, inflationary pressures, and an uncertain Federal Reserve stance. But can markets recover, or is this the beginning of a larger shift? Bitcoin & Stocks Plunge as Risk Appetite Fades Investor confidence is dwindling as macroeconomic pressures mount. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq recorded sharp losses, with the tech-heavy index falling nearly 3.8%. The “Magnificent 7” stocks lost a staggering $830 billion in market value, highlighting the scale of the sell-off. Bitcoin, often considered digital gold, was not spared amid a selloff recorded in the broader crypto market. BTC price today was down about 1% and exchanged hands at $81,579, while its one-day trading volume soared 33% to $58.7 billion. Notably, the flagship crypto has touched a 24-hour low of $76,624, reflecting the cautious stance of the investors. Besides, a recent report hints at a further BTC dip to $70K , which has weighed on the traders’ sentiment. Meanwhile, analysts at QCP Group noted that post-election optimism is fading, with put option volumes reaching their highest levels since 2020. Despite concerns, there are some silver linings. The report noted that falling 10-year Treasury yields and a weakening US dollar historically support equities, Bitcoin, and other digital assets. However, investors remain cautious amid policy uncertainty and economic risks. Bitcoin Dips As Trump’s Tariff Policies Spark Economic Concerns According to the latest report from Yahoo Finance , Goldman Sachs has slashed its 2025 US GDP growth forecast from 2.4% to 1.7%, citing adverse trade policy assumptions under Trump. The investment bank also raised its inflation projection, expecting the Federal Reserve’s preferred gauge to hit 3% by year-end. The revised outlook highlights the economic strain from rising tariffs. Goldman Sachs economist Jan Hatzius outlined three major impacts: higher consumer prices, tighter financial conditions, and delayed business investments. These factors could stifle economic growth and weigh on market performance. Morgan Stanley echoed similar concerns, cutting its 2025 GDP forecast to 1.5% from 1.9%. Chief economist Michael Gapen also raised his core PCE inflation forecast to 2.7%, up from a previous 2.5% estimate. The lingering inflation threat may force the Fed to hold interest rates steady longer than expected. Having said that, these could impact the risk-bet assets like Bitcoin as well as the stock market. All eyes are now on the upcoming US CPI inflation data , which would provide more cues on the US economic health and the current inflationary pressure. Is a US Recession on the Horizon? Recession fears are gaining traction. Former PIMCO CEO Mohamed El-Erian increased his US recession probability estimate to 25-30%, up from 10% earlier this year. Betting markets reflect similar concerns, with Polymarket estimating a 38% chance of a recession being officially declared by year-end. Source: Polymarket Uncertainty over Trump’s fiscal policies and the Federal Reserve’s stance has created a volatile market environment. The Fed may still cut rates twice this year, in June and December, but near-term uncertainty could keep them on the sidelines. Considering that, it appears that Bitcoin and the broader financial market may take a hit in the coming days as the macroeconomic concerns continue to dampen the sentiment.

After a hiatus that felt like an eternity for many Indian crypto enthusiasts, global crypto exchange giant Coinbase is gearing up for a triumphant comeback. The latest buzz is that Coinbase has received a crucial nod from India’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), a pivotal step that signals their intent to reignite trading services in the vibrant Indian market. Let’s dive into what this exciting development means for you and the future of crypto in India. Why is Coinbase’s FIU Approval a Game Changer for India? For those unfamiliar, the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) is the central national agency responsible for receiving, processing, analyzing and disseminating information relating to suspected financial offenses. FIU approval is not just a formality; it’s a significant regulatory hurdle that Coinbase has successfully cleared. This registration essentially gives Coinbase the green light to operate as a compliant entity within India’s financial ecosystem, specifically under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). Think of it as Coinbase getting its official ‘license to operate’ in the Indian crypto arena. But why is this such a big deal? Here’s a breakdown: Legitimacy and Trust: FIU registration lends a layer of credibility and trust to Coinbase’s operations in India. It signals to users and regulators alike that Coinbase is committed to operating within the legal framework of the country. Wider Market Access: This approval opens the doors for Coinbase to re-engage with the vast and rapidly growing India crypto market . India, with its tech-savvy population and increasing interest in digital assets, represents a massive opportunity for Coinbase. Investor Confidence: The move is likely to boost investor confidence in the Indian crypto sector as a whole. A major player like Coinbase securing regulatory approval can be seen as a positive signal, potentially attracting more investment and participation in the market. Competitive Landscape: Coinbase’s return will intensify competition among crypto exchange India platforms. This could lead to better services, lower fees, and more innovative offerings for Indian crypto users. Coinbase’s Journey in India: From Launch to Hiatus and Relaunch Coinbase’s relationship with India has been a rollercoaster. Let’s rewind a bit: The Initial Launch (2022): Coinbase initially launched in India with much fanfare in April 2022. There was palpable excitement in the Indian crypto community about the entry of a global giant. However, this initial foray was short-lived. The Pause Button (September 2023): Just months after launching, Coinbase abruptly halted operations in September 2023. The primary reason cited was ‘regulatory uncertainty’ and challenges related to payment processing via UPI (Unified Payments Interface), a popular payment method in India. This sudden exit was a setback for Coinbase and dampened spirits in the Indian crypto space. The Relaunch Plan (2025): Now, with the FIU approval in hand, Coinbase is confidently charting a course for a relaunch, aiming for sometime in 2025, as per CoinDesk reports. This indicates a renewed commitment and a more strategic approach to navigating the Indian regulatory landscape. Navigating India’s Cryptocurrency Regulation Landscape Understanding cryptocurrency regulation India is crucial to grasp the significance of Coinbase’s FIU approval. India’s approach to crypto regulation has been evolving, marked by a cautious yet progressive stance. Here are key aspects to consider: No outright ban, but strict compliance: India hasn’t banned cryptocurrencies outright, unlike some nations. However, the regulatory environment emphasizes compliance with existing financial laws, particularly those related to anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT). Taxation framework: India has implemented a taxation framework for crypto transactions, including a 30% tax on gains from virtual digital assets and a 1% TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) on transactions. This tax regime, while debated, provides a framework for revenue generation from crypto activities. FIU’s Role: The FIU plays a central role in monitoring and regulating crypto exchanges to ensure compliance with PMLA. Registration with the FIU is now mandatory for entities dealing in virtual digital assets. Evolving Regulatory Clarity: The regulatory landscape is still maturing. There are ongoing discussions and deliberations about comprehensive crypto regulations that could provide greater clarity and foster innovation while mitigating risks. What to Expect from Coinbase India 2.0? As Coinbase prepares for its India relaunch, what can Indian crypto users and the market anticipate? Wider Range of Services: It’s likely that Coinbase will offer a broader suite of services compared to its initial launch. This could include advanced trading features, staking options, educational resources, and potentially integration with more Indian payment methods. Localized Approach: Coinbase will likely adopt a more localized approach, tailoring its offerings and communication to the specific needs and preferences of the Indian market. This could involve regional language support and customized user experiences. Emphasis on Compliance: Given the FIU approval process, expect Coinbase to be even more focused on regulatory compliance and user security. This could translate to robust KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML procedures. Partnerships and Ecosystem Building: Coinbase may explore partnerships with Indian financial institutions and tech companies to build a stronger ecosystem and expand its reach within the country. Challenges Ahead for Coinbase in India While the FIU approval is a major victory, Coinbase will still face challenges in the Indian market: Competition: The Indian crypto exchange market is already crowded with established players like WazirX, CoinDCX, and others. Coinbase will need to differentiate itself to gain significant market share. Taxation Policies: The existing crypto tax regime in India, particularly the 30% tax on gains, can be a deterrent for some traders. Navigating this tax landscape effectively will be crucial. Regulatory Evolution: Cryptocurrency regulation India is still evolving. Future regulatory changes could pose new challenges or require adjustments to Coinbase’s operational model. Payment Infrastructure: Ensuring seamless and reliable payment gateways, particularly UPI integration, will be essential for a smooth user experience. Actionable Insights for Indian Crypto Enthusiasts What should you, as an Indian crypto enthusiast, do with this news? Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on further announcements from Coinbase regarding their India relaunch timeline and service offerings. Follow crypto news sources and Coinbase’s official channels. Prepare for Opportunities: Coinbase’s return could bring new trading opportunities and potentially more competitive pricing. Be ready to explore these possibilities when they launch. Understand Regulations: Familiarize yourself with the current cryptocurrency regulation India and tax implications. This knowledge will help you navigate the crypto market effectively. Exercise Caution: While Coinbase’s FIU approval is positive, always remember to invest responsibly and be aware of the risks associated with cryptocurrency trading. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Crypto in India? Coinbase securing FIU approval is undoubtedly a landmark moment for the Indian crypto market. It signifies a growing acceptance of crypto within the regulatory framework and opens up exciting possibilities for the future. While challenges remain, Coinbase’s anticipated relaunch in 2025 injects a fresh dose of optimism and competition into the Indian crypto landscape. It will be fascinating to witness how this unfolds and shapes the next chapter of India’s crypto journey. The return of a global player like Coinbase could indeed be a catalyst for further growth and maturity in the India crypto market , benefiting both users and the overall ecosystem.

Bitcoin at $80K Faces Trump Tariff Test,https://coinpedia.org/news/crypto-market-crash-incoming-bitcoin-at-80k-faces-trump-tariff-test/,"The post Crypto Market Crash Incoming? Bitcoin at $80K Faces Trump Tariff Test appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin, after hitting the glorious high of $109K, is hanging at $80K below its crucial level . It is at a crucial point as it faces economic uncertainty with Trump’s second innings and new tariffs impacting global markets. Similar to his last presidency, in 2018, BTC dropped 72% under similar conditions—will history repeat, or is BTC ready to break the trend? There is no doubt that the current crypto market is at a critical turning point, and with the Government’s plan to use the existing bitcoin the market is back to square one. Experts at 10x Research believe history is repeating itself. 10x Research analysts warn that investors should be extra careful, as past bull runs have followed a similar pattern—starting with extreme hype and ending in sharp losses. The Same Story, Different Year Every crypto bull run begins with big promises and catchy slogans, convincing people that prices will never stop rising. But when the hype dies down, reality kicks in. 10x Research points out that in 2017, Ripple (XRP) became the second-largest cryptocurrency, but in 2021, it couldn’t reclaim its position. Similarly, Ethereum was the star of the last bull run with DeFi and NFTs, but now, in 2025, meme coins and Solana are leading the hype. The majority of coins failed to impress this year. Solana is down 59% from its peak and is currently battling the $120-$130 support range. A break below could signal a further downside. Recently, Trump’s Solana-based meme coin, TRUMP , also plunged to $10.50, dropping over 85% from its January peak of $73.43. The decline aligns with broader market selloffs, as Bitcoin, Ethereum , and traditional indices face losses. Institutions Win, Retail Investors Struggle Another pattern is how big institutions take advantage of the market while smaller investors lose out. In past cycles, institutions profited by trading the interest rate differences between DeFi and traditional finance. This time, they’re making money from the gap between the Bitcoin spot and futures markets. Meanwhile, everyday traders are realizing how difficult it is to compete in a game they can’t control. Will History Repeat? This cycle differs from 2018 mainly due to the rise of Bitcoin ETFs , which have attracted massive institutional inflows, countering economic pressures. While Trump’s new tariffs have shaken markets and strengthened the U.S. dollar, Bitcoin has shown resilience by holding key support levels. Exchange balances are at a six-year low, signaling strong accumulation, and large withdrawals suggest growing investor confidence. However, Crypto analyst Lark Davis warns against nostalgia for Trump’s past policies, arguing that his administration in the past was harmful to crypto. While Trump’s current actions are causing short-term market pain, Davis believes they will ultimately set the stage for an explosive bull run. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Market Chaos: Nearly $1 Billion Liquidated as BTC, ETH Continue To Struggle , On the other hand, Rekt Capital highlights that Bitcoin corrections are a natural part of every bull cycle. In this run alone, BTC has seen multiple pullbacks, with the latest reaching -28 %, reinforcing the idea that dips are expected in strong uptrends. https://twitter.com/rektcapital/status/1899168307443548476 What Next? Crypto analyst Michael Nadeau suggests that Bitcoin’s returns are shrinking each cycle, with on-chain data showing a clear pattern. Long-term holder MVRV peaks have dropped consistently, and Bitcoin’s cycle gains have also declined—from 80x in 2017 to 20x in 2021 and now just 6.6x in 2025. While it’s unclear if this cycle has peaked, he believes the data points to a top being in. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Next TRUMP-level Token Upcoming?,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/temporary-market-pullback-cant-stop-catzilla-community-support-surges-as-a-major-milestone-nears-next-trump-level-token-upcoming,"Despite recent minor dips in the market, a particular crypto token is capturing attention and gaining momentum. Its community is rallying with energy and anticipation as it approaches a significant milestone, hinting at its potential to echo past crypto success stories. Investors are keeping a close eye on this emerging contender, eagerly speculating if it could replicate the historic rise seen by tokens like TRUMP. This buzz creates a fertile ground for bullish expectations. Catzilla ($CATZILLA): A Meme Coin with Serious Growth Potential Catzilla ($CATZILLA) is one of those projects that seems too wild to ignore—a mix of Japanese kaiju culture, internet memes, and crypto. At first glance, it might just seem like another meme token, but there’s more going on under the hood. With a structured presale and a growing community, Catzilla has some actual momentum behind it. A Presale with 14 Stages—Here’s Where Things Stand Instead of a typical one-shot token sale, Catzilla’s presale is broken into 14 stages, giving investors multiple chances to buy in before launch. As each stage progresses, the price ticks up, meaning early buyers get in at a lower cost. Current Presale Stats: Current Price: $0.0009 Next Stage Price: $0.0010 Final Presale Price: $0.0016 Funds Raised So Far: $2.2M+ and climbing Right now, it’s at Stage 7, and the CoinMarketCap community seems optimistic about where it’s headed. Since the price keeps increasing with each stage, some investors are getting in now to lock in a lower price before the token hits exchanges. Secure $CATZILLA Now Before Its Price Surges What Makes Catzilla Different? Plenty of meme coins rely purely on hype, but this one has a few things going for it besides just viral appeal. 1. There’s a Unique Concept A big part of the project revolves around a kaiju-style concept. Its mascot is a giant cat that destroys cities and earns rewards. 2. It’s Tapping into Multiple Communities Catzilla is clearly designed to appeal to more than just crypto traders. The mix of anime, gaming, and meme culture makes it something that could attract: Crypto investors looking for early-stage projects Meme lovers who enjoy viral, internet-driven trends Anime and gaming fans who like the kaiju-inspired theme That mix of audiences could help sustain interest in the long term. 3. There’s a Strong Focus on Community Involvement A big part of the project is community engagement, whether it’s through governance voting, staking rewards, or the play-to-earn mechanics in the game. The more people participate, the more active the ecosystem becomes—which could help with long-term sustainability. Is It Worth Getting In Now? The presale is moving along quickly, and since the price keeps increasing in stages, there’s a time factor involved. Like any meme coin, it’s a speculative play—there’s potential for major upside, but also risks, especially in a volatile market. That said, the combination of an actual game, community engagement, and a structured presale makes Catzilla more interesting than most meme coins that pop up and disappear. Whether it turns into a big winner depends on how well they execute on the roadmap, but it’s one to keep an eye on. Take Advantage of the $CATZILLA Surge Conclusion Despite coins like TRUMP showing less short-term potential, Catzilla positions itself as the ultimate meme coin championing financial freedom. With a remarkable 700% ROI potential during its presale, the token price is set to rise from $0.0002 to $0.0016 over 14 stages. Offering governance features, loyalty incentives, and staking options, Catzilla aims to unite crypto enthusiasts to overcome challenges and reach new heights by acquiring $CATZILLA tokens and opposing crypto adversaries.

The fluctuation in the value of meme coins like SHIB and DOGE has gained attention. Traders and investors are closely monitoring these shifts, as such market conditions create both challenges and opportunities. In this article, we will explore how much the price of Shiba Inu could be worth if 1 SHIB equals 10,000 DOGE, based on the current prices of both coins. How Much Will Shiba Inu Price Be Worth if 1 SHIB Equals 10,000 DOGE? Shiba Inu price could see a substantial price increase if 1 SHIB equals 10,000 Dogecoin (DOGE). Currently, Dogecoin is valued at $0.16, while Shiba Inu is priced at $0.000011. Under this new assumption, if 1 SHIB were to be equivalent to 10,000 DOGE, Shiba Inu’s price would jump to around $1.60. A significant market value increase triggered by the expected growth will positively affect all current SHIB holders. Theoretical proof of such substantial market value adjustments depends on major industry changes to occur. Factors That Could Fuel the SHIB Rally Various elements make a strong case for a substantial rise in Shiba Inu price. SHIB price could increase through the expansion of the SHIB ecosystem and intensified SHIB burn activities as well as market recovery among similar memecoins. Additionally, the rebound of Ethereum-based tokens and Bitcoin could positively impact SHIB. The ongoing development of Shibarium also plays a crucial role in fueling its potential growth. If the broader crypto market experiences a recovery, SHIB may follow suit and gain momentum. How Low Can SHIB Price Go? The SHIB price has seen a decrease recently, reflecting ongoing market volatility. The meme coin is trading at 0.00001176, showing a 6% decrease. Technical analysis highlights a bearish outlook, with the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator in negative territory. The MACD lines remain close to neutral, showing weak downward momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 31, indicating that SHIB remains in neutral zone For potential price targets, the Shiba Inu price prediction faces resistance around 0.000013. If the token breaks this resistance, it could experience an upward push. However, the immediate support level remains at 0.00001. A breach of this support could lead to further downside in the price. Shiba Inu Price Chart: TraingView DOGE price has been experiencing fluctuations recently, with significant movements observed over the last few days. The DOGE price stood at $0.16, reflecting a slight 5% decrease The DOGE price movement continues to be closely tied to the support at $0.15, with the price expected to test the resistance near $0.20 in the near term. To sum up, If 1 SHIB equals 10,000 DOGE, the Shiba Inu price could surge dramatically. Such a development would demand extensive industry restructuring together with general market acceptance. The future course of SHIB depends heavily on market dynamics together with tokenomics and ecosystem advancement.

The Space Force is currently investing $1 billion in its Rapid Resilient Command and Control (R2C2) program, an ambitious effort to modernize satellite technology for orbital warfare. This has naturally led to speculation within the crypto community about the potential role of blockchain technology in securing and managing these advanced space-based systems. The Space Force’s technological transformation The Space Force’s R2C2 program represents a significant investment in the future of space-based defense. With a budget of $1 billion, the program aims to create a fast, cloud-based system for satellites that can maneuver in orbit and effectively counter threats such as cyberattacks. The initial version of the R2C2 system is slated for launch by April 2025, with the Space Force partnering with approximately 20 companies, including Rogue Space Systems, according to SpaceNews. This initiative aligns with projections that the space industry could reach a staggering $1 trillion by 2040, driven primarily by advancements in satellite technology and increased defense spending, per Bloomberg. Trump’s consistent advocacy for the Space Force – beginning with his 2018 directive to establish the new branch of the military – combined with his recent crypto-friendly policies, creates a compelling narrative. Could these seemingly disparate interests pave the way for the integration of blockchain technology into the vast and complex domain of space defense? Connecting the dots: Blockchain’s potential role in space Rogue Space Systems, one of the contractors involved in the R2C2 program, recently launched its Barry-2 CubeSat, equipped with technology from Forward Edge-AI, a company specializing in AI security solutions for the defense sector. Forward Edge-AI’s Isidore Quantum® Space Encryptor, scheduled for launch in March 2025, is designed to secure AI systems in space, according to Rogue’s website. It’s particularly notable that Forward Edge-AI collaborates with blockchain projects such as Constellation, which utilizes a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) architecture for scalable and secure data processing. Data from the Constellation Network’s Explorer suggests that the US Federal Government has already begun utilizing $DAG for data security applications, hinting at its potential relevance for similar use cases in space. The inherent security and tamper-proof nature of blockchain technology could offer significant advantages for the Space Force, particularly in managing CubeSat networks and protecting sensitive AI systems from potential threats. While other blockchain projects, such as SpaceChain, are also exploring the applications of blockchain in space, the confirmed connection between a Space Force contractor and a blockchain project adds a new layer of intrigue. Of course, it’s also important to remember that the relationship between the $DAG and Space Force is unconfirmed, and the topic is largely speculative. Crypto’s untapped potential Trump’s recent embrace of cryptocurrencies, including his January 2025 executive order on digital assets and his proposals for a US crypto reserve backed by Bitcoin and Ethereum, signals a growing recognition of the potential benefits of digital currencies. Combined with his championing of the Space Force, this raises intriguing questions about the potential for an intersection between the crypto and space sectors. While the potential benefits are clear, blockchain technology still faces significant hurdles in the context of space applications. These include intense competition from established tech giants, evolving regulatory frameworks, and the relatively untested nature of cryptocurrency in defense systems. While Citi estimates that the space industry could reach a staggering $1 trillion by 2040, blockchain’s ability to carve out a significant role in that market remains uncertain. For crypto investors, the prospect of blockchain securing a foothold in the space industry presents both significant opportunities and considerable risks. Projects with a strong emphasis on security features, such as Constellation ($DAG), which currently trades at $0.03774 with a $134 million market cap on Coinbase, could be well-positioned to benefit. However, it is also possible that other cryptocurrencies with Trump’s explicit endorsement, such as Dogecoin (DOGE) or Bitcoin (BTC), could also experience a surge in value if the Space Force were to adopt blockchain for payments or other technological applications. Given the inherent volatility of the crypto market, investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough due diligence before making any investment decisions based on this speculative trend. As the Space Force’s R2C2 program progresses and Trump’s crypto policies continue to evolve, the potential for blockchain technology to play a role in the space industry will undoubtedly remain a topic of intense speculation and debate. Whether this potential convergence represents a moonshot opportunity or a recipe for disaster remains to be seen. Note: The article above is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice. Reaching for the moon: is this the future? The $1 trillion space industry by 2040, is indeed a tantalizing prize for the crypto sector. As Trump’s crypto ambitions meet the Space Force’s bold plans, the next step for securing satellites or new space tech using blockchain remains to be seen. Whether or not it will take hold is a matter of high-stakes that could potentially re-define both industries. Only time will tell if the void of space will welcome a new era for Dogecoin, Bitcoin, Constellation, and other similar projects.

With this regulatory approval, Kraken can now partner with traditional financial institutions and expand its offerings to better serve UK users, the exchange said in a blog post . “The U.K. is on the brink of mass crypto adoption, and Kraken is poised to lead the way with industry-leading products,” Bivu Das, Kraken’s UK General Manager, said. Kraken’s FCA Approval Aligns with Rising Crypto Adoption in the UK Kraken’s FCA approval comes at a time when crypto adoption in the UK is surging. According to FCA research , over seven million UK adults (equivalent to 12% of the adult population) currently hold crypto assets. Additionally, Kraken has seen an uptick in GBP-denominated trading volumes, reinforcing the UK as one of its most active markets globally. This latest license follows Kraken’s recent approval under the EU’s MiFID framework, which enables it to offer regulated derivatives trading to European users. By securing compliance with both UK and EU regulators, Kraken is solidifying its position as a bridge between crypto and traditional finance. Having operated in the UK since 2014, Kraken was the first major exchange to introduce BTC/GBP trading pairs. The platform now supports over 300 cryptocurrencies and offers multiple fiat onramps for British users. https://x.com/krakenfx/status/1899126667538247778 Beyond trading, Kraken has expanded its presence through strategic partnerships with UK sports brands, including Williams Racing F1 and Tottenham Hotspur FC. “Today’s news builds on Kraken’s momentum in securing key regulatory approvals and licenses, including our recent EU MiFID license, which paves the way for us to serve advanced European crypto traders with an expanded regulated derivatives offering,” Das said. Looking ahead, the company plans to introduce new crypto and fiat products in the coming months, aiming to provide UK users with enhanced tools for managing digital assets. Kraken Mulls 2026 IPO Kraken is preparing for an initial public offering (IPO) as early as the first quarter of 2026, taking advantage of what appears to be a more favorable regulatory climate under President Donald Trump. Kraken’s IPO plans are not yet final and could change in the coming months. As reported, the SEC has agreed in principle to dismiss its lawsuit against cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, according to a statement from the company. The case will be dropped with prejudice, meaning it cannot be refiled. Kraken will not admit to any wrongdoing, pay penalties, or change its business operations. The SEC sued Kraken in November 2023 , alleging it operated as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, clearing agency, and dealer. The regulator also accused the company of commingling customer and corporate funds. Kraken contested the charges, leading a federal judge to rule the case had enough merit to proceed to trial.

While XRP is consolidating around $2.55, with analysts predicting a potential surge to $8.76, Rexas Finance is stealing the spotlight with its explosive presale performance. Starting at $0.03, RXS has skyrocketed to $0.20 in its 12th and final presale stage, marking a 6.6x increase. With a confirmed listing price of $0.25 and a launch set for 2025, RXS is positioning itself as a game-changer in the real-world asset (RWA) tokenization space. The Rise of Rexas Finance (RXS) Rexas Finance is redefining how real-world assets interact with blockchain technology. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, RXS focuses on tokenizing tangible assets like real estate, gold, and commodities. Imagine someone in Asia owning a percentage of a luxury apartment in New York or a vineyard in France, earning passive income effortlessly. The RXS token, an ERC-20 standard token, is designed for widespread adoption and interoperability. With a total supply of 1 billion tokens, Rexas Finance has allocated 50% to the presale, ensuring liquidity and accessibility. The presale has already raised over $46 million, with 452,465,645 tokens sold, representing 90.5% of the allocated presale tokens. Real-World Asset Tokenization A New Era of Ownership Rexas Finance is bridging the gap between blockchain and real-world assets, creating endless possibilities for investors. The platform’s token builder allows users to tokenize their assets effortlessly, while the launchpad enables fundraising for these tokenized assets. This democratization of asset ownership is unlocking trillions of dollars in global markets, from real estate to precious metals. For instance, Rexas Estate is enabling fractional ownership of high-value properties, making real estate investment accessible to everyone. The Quickmint Bot simplifies the tokenization process, while Rexas GenAI and AI Shield ensure security and efficiency. The RXS Presale Phenomenon The RXS presale has been nothing short of phenomenal. Starting at $0.03, the token price has surged to $0.20 in the final stage, reflecting overwhelming demand. Early investors have already seen a 6.6x return, and with the listing price confirmed at $0.25, the potential for further gains is immense. The presale’s success is a testament to the project’s innovative approach and strong community support. Rexas Finance could have easily raised funds from venture capitalists but chose a public presale to give everyone a chance to be part of this revolution. This decision has paid off, with the presale stages selling out swiftly and raising $41 million in the first 11 stages alone. The final stage is now live, offering investors a last opportunity to buy RXS at $0.20 before the price increases to $0.25 at launch. Building Trust and Momentum Rexas Finance has undergone a CertiK audit, ensuring the security and reliability of its smart contracts. This audit, combined with listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, has boosted investor confidence and visibility. With over 100 million monthly visitors on these platforms, RXS is gaining exposure to a massive audience of investors and enthusiasts. To further engage the community, Rexas Finance is running a $1 million giveaway. Twenty lucky winners will each receive $50,000 worth of RXS tokens. This initiative has already attracted over 1.2 million entries, driving awareness and participation. Conclusion Ripple (XRP) may be on its way to $10, but Rexas Finance (RXS) is setting its sights even higher. With its groundbreaking approach to real-world asset tokenization, RXS is not just a pit stop but a potential powerhouse on its way to $25 and beyond. As the final presale stage nears completion, now is the time to join the revolution and secure your stake in the future of asset ownership.

The revised bill , spearheaded by a bipartisan coalition that includes Senators Bill Hagerty (R-TN), Tim Scott (R-SC), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), and Angela Alsobrooks (D-MD), aims to provide a structured path for stablecoin issuers while maintianing consumer protection, financial stability, and national economic interests. GENIUS Act: The Changing Era For Stablecoins? The GENIUS Act has been under development through extensive consultations with industry participants, academic experts, and government stakeholders. According to the lawmakers backing it, the bill seeks to unlock stablecoins’ economic potential while maintaining oversight to mitigate systemic risks. Senator Hagerty mentioned in the press release that stablecoins can enhance transaction efficiency, drive demand for U.S. Treasuries, and position the U.S. as a leader in financial innovation. Meanwhile, Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott framed the legislation as necessary to ensure the stablecoin sector grows within the U.S. regulatory umbrella, preventing American firms from being outcompeted by foreign issuers. “This bipartisan agreement will protect consumers and expand financial inclusion for Americans across the country.” The revised bill, which the Senate Banking Committee will vote on on March 13, introduces stricter standards for stablecoin issuers, particularly foreign-based ones, by enforcing higher reserve, liquidity, and compliance requirements. It could significantly transform the global stablecoin space if passed, reinforcing the U.S. dollar’s dominance in digital finance. Strengthening U.S. Stablecoins While Increasing Foreign Issuer Scrutiny A key aspect of the updated GENIUS Act is its tougher stance on non-U.S. stablecoin issuers. Dom Kwok, founder of a prominent Web3 application, highlighted that the legislation’s new provisions introduce stricter reserve requirements, anti-money laundering (AML) compliance, counter-terrorism financing checks, and liquidity mandates. https://twitter.com/dom_kwok/status/1899263834558468383 These high standards could create formidable barriers for foreign stablecoin issuers, giving U.S.-based companies like Circle (issuer of USDC) and Ripple (issuer of RLUSD) a competitive edge. The bill maintains its core framework, which is that stablecoin issuers with over $10 billion in market capitalization will fall under Federal Reserve oversight. In contrast, smaller issuers will continue to be regulated at the state level. Senator Lummis also mentioned that maintaining a dual oversight structure, where issuers can choose between state and national regulatory pathways, balances innovation and security. The bill aims to facilitate stablecoin growth within a structured framework, preventing regulatory arbitrage while ensuring compliance with national financial stability objectives. Potential Market Impact and Legislative Hurdles The GENIUS Act is part of a broader legislative effort to establish a stablecoin framework in the U.S., aligning with competing proposals like the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act and the Lummis-Gillibrand Payment Stablecoin Act. The latter two proposals also impose strict reserve requirements, mandate transparent redemption policies, and require stablecoin issuers to undergo third-party audits. However, the GENIUS Act has gained momentum due to its bipartisan backing and alignment with the Trump administration’s pro-crypto stance. Industry experts and financial analysts believe passing a stablecoin bill could transform U.S. digital asset markets. A February 2025 report from OurNetwork revealed that stablecoins comprise over 1% of the U.S. dollar M2 money supply, highlighting their growing role in the financial system. Source: OurNetwrok A recent S&P Global Ratings analysis also emphasized that stablecoin adoption among institutional investors would remain stagnant without clear regulation, limiting their mainstream financial integration. https://twitter.com/cryptonews/status/1892445172291551657 The bill’s pathway through Congress remains uncertain. If approved by the Senate Banking Committee, it will move to a full Senate vote before advancing to the House of Representatives. Should both chambers approve it, the bill will head to President Trump’s desk for final approval or veto. As it stands now, the upcoming March 13 vote will be a key milestone in determining whether the bill will move forward or face additional revisions in its journey toward becoming law.

Clearstream announced on Tuesday that it will initially support Bitcoin and Ethereum, offering services to 2,500 institutional clients, according to a Bloomberg report on March 11. The platform will utilize its majority-owned subsidiary Crypto Finance as a sub-custodian for digital assets. Clearstream Eyes Expansion Into Staking, Lending, and More Crypto Services Over time, Clearstream plans to expand its offerings to include additional cryptocurrencies, staking, lending, and brokerage services. “With this offering, we are creating a one-stop shop around custody, brokerage, and settlement,” said Jens Hachmeister, head of issuer services and new digital markets at Clearstream. He added that the move will eventually allow the company to provide services for stablecoins and tokenized securities as well. Traditional financial firms have been increasing their exposure to digital assets, driven by evolving regulatory clarity in regions such as the European Union, Singapore, and the UAE. https://x.com/esatoshiclub/status/1899370665133723970 The EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework, which came into effect last year, has paved the way for banks and financial institutions to integrate crypto into their services. For example, Spanish banking giant BBVA SA recently received regulatory approval to launch crypto trading for retail clients, reflecting a broader trend of institutional adoption. As one of Europe’s largest clearinghouses, Clearstream currently oversees €20 billion ($21.7 billion) in assets under custody as of January 2024. The company’s central securities depository will allow clients to access its crypto custody and settlement services through their existing Clearstream Banking SA accounts. According to Crypto Finance CEO Stijn Vander Straeten, planning for the crypto offering began about a year ago when demand was still relatively low. However, institutional interest has since surged, particularly following the implementation of MiCA. “There has been very high demand for crypto support from international banking clients,” Vander Straeten noted. He emphasized that many large financial institutions spend up to €5 million on developing internal crypto teams, whereas Clearstream’s service will provide them with a compliant solution at no additional cost. Deutsche Boerse Expands Crypto Offerings Last year, BaFin, Germany’s financial regulator, issued four licenses to Crypto Finance, a firm operated by Deutsche Börse. Subsequently, in March, the German stock exchange launched a regulated spot platform for crypto assets targeting institutional clients. At the time, Deutsche Börse said the platform dubbed the Deutsche Börse Digital Exchange (DBDX) would offer a fully regulated ecosystem for the trading, settlement, and custody of crypto assets. In July, the firm also listed the Bitcoin Macro exchange-traded product (ETP) on the Deutsche Börse Xetra platform. The ETP adjusts its Bitcoin exposure based on macroeconomic factors and is trading under the ticker symbol “BMAC” with a total expense ratio of 2.00%.

Threatened DeFi liquidations are becoming more common as ETH sank under $2,000 and dipped as low as $1,700. Ethereum (ETH) collaterals on decentralized protocols are under threat, as ETH dipped under $2,000. Several whales had to top up their collaterals to avoid liquidation in DeFi lending vaults. ETH dipped as low as $1,791.23, triggering several liquidation tiers on decentralized protocols. For one of the whales, the dip under $1,800 was enough to trigger liquidation for a total debt of $2.27M DAI. The liquidated collateral, however, was valued at $1.23M. #PeckShieldAlert #Liquidation An address (0x678f…4954 ) that held a leveraged long position of 1.5K $weETH (total debt: ~2.27M $DAI ) has been liquidated. A total of 643.78 weETH (worth ~$1.23M) was seized after $ETH dropped below $1,800. pic.twitter.com/CVURWtEzqf — PeckShieldAlert (@PeckShieldAlert) March 11, 2025 The liquidation protocol now carries additional WETH, while the liquidated party still has the DAI issued for the loan. The borrowers may not be hurt by the liquidations, as they are a way to tap ETH value at a favorable price. However, the protocol now holds additional tokens, which may be sold on the market, or recycled as collaterals. One significant position is threatened if ETH falls by just another 6.4%. The loan is still 182% collateralized, but falls within the recently increased volatility for ETH. The position started to enter liquidation, although ETH price has now recovered and the vault retains its collateral. A large vault faces liquidation at $1,798.83, despite the 153.42% collateral ratio. This loan is at a higher risk if the price of ETH falls by just 5.9%. The borrower retained 75M DAI for other DeFi operations, but in case of liquidation, will leave over 60K ETH to the protocol. Some of the DAI holders have tried buying the ETH dip, though underestimating the volatility. One of the whales spent $30.8 DAI to buy more ETH, starting at $2,014. The position is still underwater, though ETH has attempted recoveries above $1,900. Another dormant account posted additional collateral just in time after months of inactivity. The liquidation price for that whale is at $1,836 per ETH. One of the saving elements of DeFi are the specific oracles used in vaults. Maker’s oracle shows a slightly higher price, which may have saved some of the most vulnerable positions. DeFi also has additional protections against a cascade of liquidations. Despite this, the most recent ETH drawdown may cause a shift in ownership. After months of relatively stable prices, older whales that have deposited ETH are facing the most serious liquidation pressures. Maker lenders approach liquidation levels One of the whales set up for liquidation was suspected to be the Ethereum Foundation . The lender’s wallet was identified by Arkham Intelligence as potentially, but not certainly, belonging to the Ethereum Foundation. However, Ethereum developer, Eric Conner later dismissed the identification of the wallet as not resting on evidence. The Ethereum Foundation has announced its public address , which would most likely be used for DeFi operations. Previously, the Ethereum Foundation was criticized for selling ETH on the open market to cover operating expenses. For that reason, the Foundation already deposited ETH to Aave, Compound, and Maker, deploying $120M into the DeFi protocols. The entity tried to cover its position by depositing an additional 30,098 ETH, valued at over $56M. The whale successfully lowered the liquidation price to $1,127, currently standing safely below the ETH trading levels. The loan is 244% over-collateralized, with 100,394 ETH locked for security. The borrower carries over $78M in borrowed DAI, with the option to generate another 53M DAI. ETH feels pressure from long liquidations ETH saw over $238M in liquidations in the past 24 hours, a mix of long liquidations and attacks against short positions. Bybit is once again the leader, with over 83% in short liquidations. Ethereum liquidity shifted to short positions, with accumulation around $2,000 and at $2,200, pointing to a potential rally to attack those short positions. | Source: CoinAnk ETH open interest is still down to $9.22B in 24 hours, as traders are more cautious. Long positions have not been replenished after a series of liquidations, and derivative trading has switched to accumulating liquidity in short positions. The most active accumulation is around $2,000 and the $2,200 range, signaling a potential relief rally for ETH. The price shift toward attacking short positions may save the DeFi vaults from further pressure. Despite this, centralized derivative trading keeps affecting the DeFi sector.

The top global crypto exchange didn’t disclose the identity of the market maker but noted that it operated as a liquidity provider for the decentralized security layer GoPlus Security ( GPS ) and the AI consumer project MyShell ( SHELL ). Binance offboarded the market maker and confiscated its proceeds “for the purpose of compensating users for GPS and SHELL.” GoPlus Security’s native token, GPS, plunged in value last week after receiving a Binance listing . The asset is down more than 71% in the past seven days. GoPlus Security swatted down rumors that a “GoPlus team member or community moderator” leaked the Binance listing information in advance. “GoPlus immediately launched an internal investigation. The investigation results show that this situation is not true. Because the GoPlus team weren’t informed in advance about the March 4th listing of GPS. Everything happened rapidly, and our team only learned about the listing when the public announcement was made, after which we immediately worked to cooperate with Binance to facilitate any additional requirements on our side.” MyShell says it terminated its relationship with the newly banned market maker. “All Binance accounts associated with the Market Maker have been suspended, and all remaining assets will be transferred to our new market makers. Furthermore, all stablecoins the Market Maker sells will be fully used to buy back SHELL within 90 days. To ensure full transparency, we will publish wallet addresses related to the buyback for the community to verify. Additionally, we are working closely with Binance to make this process public and transparent.” MyShell’s token, SHELL, is down more than 28% in the past week.

Built on Ethereum and Base, Truemarkets first gained attention last year when Ethereum co-founder VitaliK Buterin “endorsed” it. During its public NFT sale, VitaliK bought 400 Patron NFTs valued at 32 ETH – highlighting his interest in the platform. While Buterin’s involvement does not indicate formal endorsement, his participation generated significant momentum for the project. The sale netted over $4 million with the ‘VitaliK stimulus’ pushing 3,300 Patro NFTs sold outs in less than 24 hours. Truemarkets – The new player in the Prediction Markets Truemarkets, much similar to Polymarket, creates a binary trading market on the event of the question for two answers – Yes/No. As a Prediction market, it allows users to predict the outcomes of real-world events, aiming to break the information asymmetry related to global news. It is integrating AI-driven mechanisms and a novel economic model to enhance accuracy and decentralization. Such markets are enabling people to express real-time sentiment about the likelihood of potential outcomes, aiming to revolutionize the market-driven forecasting. Unlike traditional prediction markets, which rely solely on human speculation, Truemarkets is incorporating automated intelligence to refine market efficiency and mitigate bias. The platform is built with an on-chain settlement mechanism using Uniswap V3 , ensuring full transparency and decentralization. Truemarkets Is Officially Live!

Prediction markets have gained significant attention, especially after users on Polymarket—the leading decentralized prediction platform launched in 2020—made accurate forecasts during the 2024 U.S. Presidential Elections on its platform. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has also expressed enthusiasm for prediction markets. In one of the Vitalik’s blog posts from November 2024, he explored the broader concept of “Info Finance” within prediction markets, highlighting their potential impact on decentralized forecasting. Ethereum co-founder VitaliK Buterin says, “ prediction markets even as they exist today are a very useful tool for the world , and they are only one example of a much larger incredibly powerful category.” The kind of predictions that can be made on Truemarkets include market trends and betting on questions like ‘Is Nvidia the largest company in the World?’, ‘Will Jisoo Win BLACKPINK’s Solo Crown in 2025?’, or predicting the TVLs of various Blockchains, such as Ethereum, BeraChain, among others. It allows prediction for football matches’ winners, viz., La Liga Winner, and also enables users to present their sentiments on ongoing geo-political issues. The Truemarket App tracks breaking news headlines or market trends in real time, acting as an Oracle that brings real-world data to your favorite onchain ecosystem. Further, it is also open to adding new creative market ideas or suggestions, from users via its Discord community. Prediction Dashboard of Truemarkets Can it compete with Polymarket? While Polymarket has long been regarded as the leader in decentralized prediction markets, Truemarkets introduces unique features that could challenge its position. One key differentiator is its AI-powered market creation system, which enables a more automated, scalable approach. Additionally, it emphasizes a permissionless framework, allowing users to create and engage with markets in a decentralized manner, avoiding the regulatory hurdles that Polymarket has faced in the past. Earlier this year, it even acknowledged the Polymarket community in its outreach efforts, encouraging active participants in Polymarket’s Discord server to check eligibility for potential airdrops. This strategic move hints at an effort to attract users from existing prediction platforms. The Future of Decentralized Prediction Markets Decentralized prediction markets have gained traction as a method for crowd-driven forecasting across politics, finance, and global events. By leveraging blockchain technology, these platforms are offering an alternative to traditional polling and market research firms, often yielding more accurate results due to financial incentives tied to truthful predictions. However, regulatory scrutiny remains a challenge. Prediction markets, particularly those dealing with political outcomes, have faced increasing oversight from authorities such as the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). While Polymarket previously faced regulatory penalties, Truemarkets’ permissionless model may provide a potential workaround by minimizing reliance on centralized control. It has also hinted at upcoming token incentives, with users expected to receive TRUE tokens as part of future rewards and governance mechanisms. This move aligns with the broader trend of decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms utilizing native tokens to enhance user engagement and liquidity. Thus, the blockchain community will be closely watching how Truemarkets navigates adoption, competition, and regulatory challenges in the coming months. Whether it can surpass established players or carve out a unique niche remains to be seen, but for now, the official launch marks a major milestone in decentralized forecasting.

Is this short-term, or could this be the start of something bigger? Sui (SUI), Aptos (APT), and Near Protocol (NEAR) are bouncing hard. How high can they go? $SUI back to March 2024 level Source: TradingView The $SUI price is once more back at the level of the March 2024 high. One year has elapsed and it’s as though $SUI has not gone anywhere, although the 146% price climb in the intervening period says otherwise. $SUI is now below important horizontal support at $2.18. Tuesday’s surge has taken the price back to this level, but for this to be anything other than a confirmation of the breakdown, the bulls must push the price beyond this level and keep it as support. Source: TradingView Zooming out into the weekly time frame, the importance of the support level becomes more evident. It looks as though a confirmation of the breakdown of the ascending trendline may take place, although there is still the rest of the week before this can become official. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI is bottoming, perhaps in a similar manner to how it did in May to July 2024. The huge surge, once a cross-up occurred, could happen again. This weekly close could be an important first step. Is a 4th major surge coming for $APT? Source: TradingView The Aptos (APT) price is once again respecting the hugely important horizontal support of $5.11. Three times previously the price has surged from this level, with 297%, 277%, and 198% percentage gains. The last two times, the Stochastic RSI has been at the bottom and has risen to the top, driving upside price momentum. The Stochastic RSI is at the bottom once again. Is it getting ready to propel $APT to another peak? $NEAR bulls must maintain $2.56 as horizontal support Source: TradingView An 8.5% rise for the price of $NEAR on Tuesday has brought it back to the very important horizontal level of $2.56. It is so important that the bulls keep this rally going and that the weekly close sees the price once more above this support level. A confirmation of the level as resistance could effectively kill another big rally for $NEAR, at least in the short term. If, on the other hand, this does become a sustained rally, and the Stochastic RSI indicators rise from the bottom to signal upside price momentum, the target levels for $NEAR, based on the Fibonacci levels, are in the chart above.

At this point, while the general decline in the market is expected to deepen even further, the Ethereum Foundation is also at risk of liquidation. Accordingly, the Ethereum Foundation now faces a major financial risk after locking a large amount of ETH in a MakerDAO vault. According to Lookonchain's post, the Ethereum Foundation has 100,394 ETH (worth $182 million) deposited into Maker, and the liquidation price is around $1,127.06. While speculations about the liquidation risk of the ETH Foundation continue, it was claimed that a wallet thought to belong to the Ethereum Foundation deposited 30,098 ETH to take precautions against the possible decrease in ETH and increase the liquidation risk level. However, two well-known Ethereum developers, eric.eth and sassal.eth, stated in a statement on X that the address that deposited 30,098 ETH to Maker was not the Ethereum Foundation address. Later, Chinese crypto journalist Wu Blockchain clarified the incident in a statement, saying that the address at risk of liquidation was more likely to belong to an early ETH investor and not the Ethereum Foundation. “While this address received a 4M DAI transfer from the Ethereum Foundation ETH Sale in May 2022, its transaction behavior and initial ETH funding trace back to jonny.eth (0xb76), suggesting it is more likely an early Ethereum investor rather than the Foundation itself.” *This is not investment advice.

The US has moved to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, repurposing seized Bitcoin for national reserves, while European policymakers remain silent on the matter, focusing instead on launching the digital euro by October 2025. Meanwhile, in Thailand, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved USDT and USDC for trading on regulated exchanges, signaling a growing acceptance of stablecoins in financial markets. Thailand SEC Approves USDT and USDC for Cryptocurrency Trading, Paving the Way for Stablecoin Adoption The Thailand Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially approved Tether’s USDt (USDT) and Circle’s USDC (USDC) for cryptocurrency trading. This regulatory milestone allows both stablecoins to be listed on regulated exchanges across the country, opening the doors for greater adoption of digital assets in Thailand. This landmark decision comes after months of regulatory discussions and public feedback, culminating in finalized changes that were set to take effect on March 16. The approval signals Thailand’s growing commitment to integrating digital assets into its financial ecosystem while ensuring compliance with regulatory frameworks. Thailand has been actively shaping its digital asset regulations to align with global trends. The recent approval of USDT and USDC follows the launch of a regulatory sandbox in August 2024, which allowed select service providers to experiment with cryptocurrency usage. As the country continues to explore blockchain-based financial solutions, stablecoins have emerged as a crucial element in digital payments and cross-border transactions. With this new approval, USDT and USDC join an exclusive list of cryptocurrencies allowed for trading within the country. The list currently includes: Bitcoin (BTC) Ether (ETH) XRP (XRP) Stellar Lumens (XLM) Cryptocurrencies tested for settlement by the Bank of Thailand The inclusion of stablecoins in this regulatory framework is expected to enhance the efficiency of digital payments, providing businesses and investors with a more reliable and less volatile crypto alternative. Tether has already issued a March 10 statement confirming that USDt’s approval will facilitate its adoption in digital asset businesses and as a payment rail in Thailand. This means that users and businesses can leverage USDT for faster, low-cost transactions, particularly in remittance payments and cross-border trade. The demand for stablecoins as a remittance solution has been growing globally, particularly in emerging markets. A December 2024 report from Chainalysis highlighted stablecoins as a ”transformative” use case for cross-border payments, especially in regions where traditional remittance services are costly and inefficient. In Sub-Saharan Africa, stablecoin remittances are reportedly 60% cheaper than conventional methods. 28.5 million unique stablecoin users sent over 600 million transactions in December alone, according to a16z Crypto. Despite this growth, stablecoins still account for a fraction of global transactions, with just $230 billion in circulating supply, compared to the $3.4 trillion processed by traditional payment systems. Thailand's embrace of stablecoins suggests that the country is positioning itself as an early adopter of blockchain-based payment solutions, reducing reliance on outdated banking systems and embracing more efficient digital settlement mechanisms. Regulatory Uncertainty Still Looms for Broader Crypto Adoption While the Thailand SEC’s decision to approve USDT and USDC is a step toward greater cryptocurrency acceptance, challenges remain. Regulatory scrutiny continues to be a key issue, especially as global watchdogs tighten control over stablecoins due to concerns over their role in financial stability and monetary policy. Despite these challenges, Thailand has demonstrated a proactive approach by encouraging innovation within regulated frameworks. The country's interest in spot Bitcoin ETFs and its crackdown on illicit crypto activities indicate that authorities are keen on balancing crypto innovation with financial security. Thailand’s approval of stablecoin trading on regulated exchanges could have far-reaching implications: Increased Adoption of Stablecoins: With legal recognition, stablecoins could become a mainstream financial instrument, providing a bridge between fiat and digital assets for businesses and individuals. Growth of Crypto-Based Payments and Remittances: The remittance market in Southeast Asia could benefit significantly, as stablecoins offer faster, cheaper alternatives to traditional banking channels. Potential Expansion into DeFi and Digital Banking: If Thailand continues on this trajectory, it may explore DeFi solutions and digital banking services powered by stablecoins. Greater Institutional Participation in Digital Assets: The approval might attract local and international businesses, making Thailand a crypto-friendly hub in Asia. Europe’s Silence on US Bitcoin Reserve Order Raises Questions on Digital Asset Strategy In related news, the European Union (EU) has yet to respond to a groundbreaking executive order by US President Donald Trump, which outlines the creation of a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve using confiscated cryptocurrency. This landmark policy shift positions Bitcoin as a strategic national asset, favoring early adopters due to its scarcity-driven economic model. Despite the significance of the move, European policymakers have remained noticeably silent, raising speculation over the bloc’s stance on integrating Bitcoin (BTC) into national reserves. With the EU preparing to launch its own central bank digital currency (CBDC), the digital euro, some experts believe the silence may reflect a broader policy divergence between the US and Europe on digital assets. On March 7, 2025, Trump’s executive order outlined a plan to build a Bitcoin reserve using BTC seized in criminal cases rather than purchasing it on the open market. The move sparked a global debate over the role of Bitcoin as a reserve asset, yet European lawmakers and financial institutions have not issued any official statements in response. One of the reasons for the EU’s reluctance to follow a similar path is the lengthy bureaucratic process required to add new national reserve assets. Anastasija Plotnikova, CEO of blockchain regulatory firm Fideum, said, “Usually, there is a very clear legislative or executive process in adding different assets to national treasuries, and in many cases, it is not an active voter or central bank support that pushes this through.” Another critical factor is the European Central Bank’s (ECB) longstanding opposition to Bitcoin. ECB President Christine Lagarde has repeatedly criticized BTC’s volatility and its role in financial markets, making it unlikely that the EU would consider adding Bitcoin to its reserves. Instead of exploring Bitcoin as a reserve asset, the EU is moving forward with its own digital currency, the digital euro, which is expected to launch in October 2025. The US and EU appear to be taking opposite approaches when it comes to digital assets. While the Trump administration is moving toward Bitcoin, European lawmakers are focused on introducing a state-controlled digital currency. James Wo, CEO of venture capital firm DFG, suggests that the ECB’s preference for a CBDC over Bitcoin explains Europe’s lack of response to Trump’s executive order. This difference in monetary strategy comes amid growing skepticism toward CBDCs globally. Critics argue that government-backed digital currencies could lead to greater financial surveillance and restrictions on financial freedom. Despite opposition from Bitcoin advocates, Christine Lagarde has defended the digital euro, arguing that it will offer privacy protections and coexist with cash rather than replace it. However, the European digital currency project has faced setbacks. The ECB’s recent Target 2 (T2) payment system outage has raised concerns about the EU’s ability to manage a complex digital financial network. If a centralized system like the digital euro were to experience similar technical failures, it could have devastating consequences for financial transactions across Europe. Meanwhile, in July 2023, Brazil’s central bank published the source code for its own CBDC pilot, revealing that the system had built-in control mechanisms that could allow authorities to freeze or even reduce user funds. This revelation fueled concerns that similar government overreach could happen with the digital euro, leading many Europeans to oppose the ECB’s push for a state-controlled digital currency. Bitcoin’s Role in the Future of National Reserves While the European Central Bank remains resistant to Bitcoin, other governments have been increasingly considering it as a national reserve asset. El Salvador became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021, holding BTC in its national treasury. Hong Kong lawmakers have also discussed expanding Bitcoin’s role in financial reserves as the region continues to position itself as a crypto-friendly hub. China, despite banning Bitcoin trading, has indirectly benefited from BTC reserves held by seized mining operations. If Bitcoin continues to gain institutional adoption, European lawmakers may eventually be forced to reconsider their stance on BTC. However, for now, the ECB’s focus remains firmly on the digital euro, with no signs of integrating Bitcoin into its monetary policy. The European Union’s silence on Trump’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve order underscores the deep divide in digital asset policies between the United States and Europe. While the US moves to accumulate Bitcoin, the EU remains committed to launching a central bank digital currency—an approach that has drawn both praise and criticism. As the October 2025 launch of the digital euro approaches, questions remain over whether a state-controlled CBDC can truly offer privacy and financial freedom, or if Europe is falling behind in embracing decentralized digital assets. With Bitcoin adoption growing globally, the EU may eventually have to reevaluate its stance—but for now, it appears that Europe is sticking to its centralized approach, even as the world moves toward decentralized finance and digital assets.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|USDT|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-11 12:00:00

At press time, the $100,000 call was the most popular BTC options contract on the exchange, boasting a notional open interest of $1.55 billion. The notional open interest represents the dollar value of the number of active option contracts at a given time. Meanwhile, the $120,000 call, the former leader up until last month , stood at the number two position, with a notional open interest of $1.33 billion. A call gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to purchase the underlying asset at a predetermined price at a later date. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market. Hence, a significant built-up of open interest in higher strike out-of-the-money calls, such as $100,000 and $120,000, reflects bullish expectations. The shift lower in the most preferred call to the $100,000 strike likely shows traders opting for a more conservative bet in the wake of the recent price crash to under $80,000. Additionally, it may signal a broader reassessment of bullish sentiment. The 25-delta risk reversals, which measure the difference between implied volatility (demand) for higher strike calls relative to lower strike puts, show negative readings or bias for protective put options out to the May end expiry. It's representative of fears of an extended price slide in the market. The pricing remains bullish in favor of call options after May. Besides, the dollar value of the total number of calls open at press time was over $16 billion – nearly twice more than $8.35 billion in put options.",Markets|Bitcoin|Options|Deribit,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-11 12:02:14

33767162,[object Object],1741694550,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"As Genius Stablecoin Bill Vote Nears, Meme Index Presale Heats Up",https://bitcoinist.com/genius-stablecoin-bill-meme-index-presale-heats-up/,"Time to Make Stablecoins Great Again – unless you’re Tether. The world’s largest stablecoin, with a $120B market cap, looks like it could be left hanging after the US Senate moved to introduce the GENIUS stablecoin bill. The bill focuses heavily on improving protections for US consumers, and edges the playing field for US-domiciled stablecoin issuers like Ripple (stablecoin: $RLUSD) and Circle (stablecoin: $USDC). But Tether is currently based in El Salvador. So what does the bill mean for USDT – and the pile of $BTC and other cryptos Tether uses to support its industry-leading stablecoin? Time to dig into the details of the Crypto President’s latest push – and why crypto presales like Meme Index might give investors an advantage amid a rapidly-changing crypto economy. GENIUS Bill: ‘America First’ for Stablecoins? The GENIUS Act gives preference to US-based stablecoins and has been met with mixed reviews, both positive and negative. Negatively, the bill proposes to bring stablecoins firmly under the oversight of the Federal Reserve: For issuers of more than $10B worth of stablecoins, it applies the Federal Reserve’s regulatory framework to depository institutions and the Office of the Controller of the Currency’s framework for non-bank issuers. For crypto purists, this goes against the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies, but it should clear up some jurisdiction issues, at least. On the positive side, the bill ‘secures stablecoin issuers’ ability to choose between state and national charters,’ providing two possible frameworks, at least for stablecoins with a total market cap under $10B. That possibility dramatically increases the power of US state authorities to regulate smaller stablecoins largely independently. The bill even includes a waiver process that would allow larger stablecoin issuers, or stablecoins that grow beyond the $10B threshold to remain under state control. Is an era of US state-back stablecoins about to emerge? Is anyone up for some California USD – $CAUSD, perhaps? Can $USDT Adjust to Changing Rules? Reporting on the initial framework included mention of a JP Morgan analysis, which concluded that Tether might be forced to sell some of its assets to include more GENIUS-compliant assets, including US Treasury bills, to fully back its $USDT tokens. Tether downplayed the problem on social media, calling JP Morgan ‘salty’ that it didn’t buy $BTC cheap. Tether currently holds over 94K $BTC valued at $7.6B, per Arkham Intelligence . Tether’s own reports on its Q4 2024 performance note that the company already holds over $94.4B in US treasuries, either directly or indirectly. Only a week ago, Tether finally announced the appointment of Simon McWilliams as CFO with the remit to undertake a full audit of the company. It’s a move the company had previously neglected to take. There’s also a distinct element of control in the GENIUS draft. The bill would require stablecoin issuers to be able to control payments in their own stablecoins, including stopping them if required (better interpreted as ‘if ordered’), and to identify accounts and account holders. Or put a different way, by setting up both federal and state charters, the bill gives each set of US authorities the power, even the requirement, to control stablecoins as digital assets within their jurisdiction. Meme Index: Adjust Your Memecoin Investment Strategy The memecoin market remains popular, with a $45B market cap, and investors are constantly searching for the newest and best meme coins to buy. But navigating a market with thousands of tokens, where new meme coins come and go each day, is a challenge for all but the most dedicated traders. Meme Index provides a solution to the same problem Tether faces; adjusting to changing markets and regulations on the fly. $MEMEX holders can allocate their tokens to one of four different memecoin indexes – Meme Frenzy, Meme Midcap, Meme Moonshot, and Meme Titan. Each index is tailored to a different level of risk and volatility, letting you adapt your investment strategy in light of market changes. As token holders, investors can also vote on the exact token profile of each index. The presale has already raised over $3.9M, and $MEMEX tokens are currently priced at $0.0166883. Learn how to buy $MEMEX here, the perfect crypto presale for a rapidly-changing crypto economy – without the US government watching your every move. Do your own research, of course; none of this is financial advice, and the crypto market is always volatile. But don’t underestimate the power of Meme Index to adjust your portfolio as the market moves.",Crypto News|Uncategorized,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|RUNE|FDUSD,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-03-11 12:02:30

While the popular meme coin has seen tremendous highs fueled by social media hype, recent price movements suggest a struggle to maintain momentum. Meanwhile, Skyren DAO emerges as a beacon of stability, offering investors a strategic alternative through its yield farming and airdrop collection mechanisms. As uncertainty grips the market, Skyren’s structured approach provides an opportunity for those seeking consistent returns amid volatility. Dogecoin’s Struggle in a Shaky Market Dogecoin has long been a favorite among retail investors, thanks to its viral appeal and high-profile endorsements. However, its reliance on speculative trading has exposed it to extreme volatility. As the broader crypto market faces bearish pressure, Dogecoin has struggled to maintain support, with investors questioning its long-term viability. Mixed Sentiments Around Dogecoin Strengths: Dogecoin maintains a strong community and significant brand recognition, which often fuels unexpected rallies. Weaknesses: Unlike more structured projects, it lacks a defined utility beyond being a meme-driven digital asset. Market Uncertainty: While some traders see its current dip as a buying opportunity, others worry about its ability to recover without renewed hype. This leaves investors searching for more predictable returns—something Skyren DAO is designed to provide. Skyren DAO: A Strategic Alternative Skyren DAO presents a fundamentally different approach, focusing on yield farming, airdrop collection, and decentralized governance to generate consistent rewards for its community. Instead of relying on speculation, it utilizes structured mechanisms to ensure ongoing value distribution. Why Skyren DAO Stands Out Airdrop Farming Expertise: Skyren is the first DAO dedicated to actively collecting airdrops from multiple blockchain ecosystems. High-Yield Staking: Investors can stake SKYRN tokens and earn passive income at competitive rates. AI-Driven Governance: A decentralized governance model ensures fair and transparent decision-making. Multi-Audit Security: Smart contracts have been audited by multiple firms, ensuring high security standards. By leveraging these strategies, Skyren DAO creates a sustainable investment model that shields its holders from the erratic swings seen in tokens like Dogecoin. Early investors are securing their SKYRN—grab yours before Phase 5 closes! Yield Farming: Stability in a Bear Market One of Skyren DAO’s standout features is its advanced yield farming strategy, which ensures investors benefit from multiple earning streams. Unlike meme-based assets that depend on hype, yield farming provides structured returns. How Skyren DAO Maximizes Yield Farming Returns Liquidity Provision: Skyren DAO supplies liquidity to emerging blockchain projects, earning rewards distributed to SKYRN holders. Automated Airdrop Collection: The DAO systematically participates in blockchain airdrop campaigns, ensuring token holders benefit from exclusive distributions. Governance Incentives: SKYRN holders can participate in DAO decisions and receive additional rewards. This dual-layered approach strengthens portfolio resilience, allowing investors to earn through structured financial strategies rather than relying on market speculation. Skyren DAO’s Presale: A Limited-Time Opportunity With presale phase 5 currently underway, investors have a chance to enter at an attractive price point before the official market launch. Presale Details Current Price: $0.048 Next Phase Price: $0.052 Launch Price: $0.16 Total Tokens: 5,000,000 SKYRN Projected ROI: 500% As the presale progresses, each phase brings a price increase, making early participation more lucrative for investors looking to maximize their holdings. Skyren’s Referral Program: More Ways to Earn Beyond staking and yield farming, Skyren offers an exclusive referral program designed to reward early adopters. How the Referral Program Works Automatic Code Generation: Every presale participant receives a unique referral code. Bonus Tokens: Referrers and new buyers both receive a 10% token bonus. No Usage Limits: There are no restrictions on how many times a referral code can be used. Easy Participation: A minimum purchase of $50 is required to qualify. Learn all about the Skyren Referral Program here. This program strengthens the Skyren ecosystem by incentivizing organic growth while offering additional earning potential to investors. Conclusion As the crypto bear market continues to shake investor confidence, Dogecoin’s struggle to maintain value highlights the risks of speculative assets. Skyren DAO, on the other hand, provides a structured and sustainable approach through yield farming, airdrop collection, and an AI-powered governance model. With its multi-layered rewards system, Skyren offers stability in an otherwise volatile market. For those looking to secure long-term returns, the Skyren DAO presale presents a compelling opportunity before the next phase price increase.

Bullion prices are benefiting from trade war tensions, climbing above $2,900 an ounce, while Bitcoin fell 16% in the same period. Gold prices rallied on Tuesday, regaining ground after a slight pullback at the start of March. Spot gold was up 0.4%, reaching $2,900.78 an ounce as of 7:30 AM UTC. The rally was supported by a weakening US dollar spot index that has dropped to 103.5, a 24-hour 0.2% downtick. The surge in gold comes after President Donald Trump’s remarks in a Fox News interview on Sunday when he said that the US economy is in a “period of transition” as his administration implements new trade policies. Gold stands against BTC as profit taking resumes Gold’s more “resilient” performance against the dollar is giving investors more incentives to turn against Bitcoin, with its price falling by more than $15,400 over the past month. According to Coingecko, BTC was trading at $81,416, reflecting a 0.3% decline over the past 24 hours and a 2.8% downtick over the past week. In a March 11 X insight , market intelligence platform Santiment reported that Bitcoin’s downward trend began in mid-February when major stakeholders started cashing out profits. Between February 20 and March 8, roughly 22,702 BTC, worth nearly $1.8 billion at current prices, were transferred from private wallets to exchanges, in what they deemed as intent to sell. Comparison of Bitcoin price and accumulation wallet trend. Source: Santiment Institutional interest, part of the biggest reasons for Bitcoin’s surge following Trump’s re-election, has dwindled since he first stepped into the Oval Office. Large-scale investors who aggressively bought BTC between November and January immensely reduced their exposure last month. “Stakeholders finally began to take profit on February 19, 2025, prices immediately began to see much steeper drop-offs. It is especially interesting to see that prices have continued to plummet (falling back to a low of $78K today) even after these high capital BTC wallets began to buy back in one week ago on March 3, 2025,” Santiment contributor Brian explained. Standard Chartered analyst Suki Cooper told Bloomberg that gold may not have a solid physical market floor due to weak demand in major markets like India and China. Yet, she suggested that fresh highs could be reached this year if inflows into gold ETFs strengthen enough to offset declining physical purchases. On the flipside, economist and gold advocate Peter Schiff has found more reasons to take digs at the US government for holding BTC, owing to its red performance streak in the last 30 days. “Now that Bitcoin fell below $77K, it’s down 30% from its January record high,” Schiff posted on X. “It’s hard to see the rationale for the U.S. government holding Bitcoin as a reserve asset when it can lose that much market value so quickly. The rationale will be even harder to see when it’s down 50%.” Bitcoin weakness will likely continue Bitcoin’s current price of $81,055 remains near a critical pivot point at $80,746, a decision zone where bears could prompt investors to sell. Technical indicators on TradingView point to a possible short-term pullback rather than a full trend reversal. The cryptocurrency’s negative momentum (-9.94%) and relatively low Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 37.44, where it remains under selling pressures. Per Coinglass data , there have been over $294 million in liquidations made on BTC’s market in the last day. Market volatility since the end of February has been high, with the Bollinger Band width at 18.70%, but a support level forming at the $78,000 level could provide a temporary floor if selling pressure continues. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has crossed below the signal line, while the Average Directional Index (ADX) is at 69.9, which could mean the coin will take weeks to recover from the current downward trend.

Ripple (XRP) has been experiencing a downfall lately, but analysts remain optimistic that a renewed bull run could be incoming. SHIB dropped 28% this month. One popular analyst sees potential for a substantial resurgence if Shibarium gains traction. What’s New Around Pi Network? The crypto project has taken center stage lately due to launching its Open Network on February 20. This allowed exchanges to list Pi Network’s native token and make it publicly accessible. The first to embrace it included Bitget, OKX, and MEXC. Binance was also rumored to join the list. The world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange even held a community vote to determine whether its users would want to see PI available for trading. Over 86% of the voters clicked the “yes” option, but the company has remained silent on the matter . It is worth mentioning that there has been rising speculation that Binance might do so as soon as this week, more specifically on March 14 . The date is special for the community since it will mark the sixth birthday of Pi Network. It also aligns with Pi Day, a celebration of the mathematical constant π (pi), which is approximately 3.14. Despite reaching the aforementioned milestone , Pi Network remains quite controversial. For instance, it keeps extending the deadline to pass KYC procedures and migrations to the mainnet. The process, known as “the Grace Period,” was supposed to run until February 28, but the team later moved it to March 14. Earlier this week, the developers warned users to complete the required steps before that date “to avoid forfeiting most of your Pi other than Pi mined within the rolling window of the last 6 months before your Pi is migrated . How’s XRP Doing? Ripple’s native token is also among the top-trending topics in the crypto space. The asset has been on a massive uptrend since the election of Donald Trump, almost reaching its all-time high of $3.40 in January this year. Since then, though, it has headed south and is currently trading at around $2.10 (per CoinGecko’s data). Several hours ago, it even dipped to a multi-month low of $1.92 before the bulls recovered some of the losses. XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko Despite the bearish environment, numerous analysts continue to envision a resurgence to new peaks for XRP. The X user Dark Defender recently suggested that the asset successfully broke the multi-year resistance line in November 2024 and tested previous resistance as support. “I’ve never seen XRP bullish more than this before,” Dark Defender stated. For their part, EGRAG CRYPTO predicted a rather ridiculous price explosion to the $27-$222 range. Such high prices would require XRP’s market capitalization to multi-trillion levels, which as of the moment, seems highly unlikely. Is SHIB Poised for a Comeback? Last but not least , we will touch upon Shiba Inu, whose price has also suffered the negative consequences of the broader crypto market crash. As of this writing, the meme coin is worth around $0.00001162, representing a 28% decline on a monthly scale. SHIB Price, Source: CoinGecko According to the popular analyst Jeremie Davinci, though, SHIB still has a chance to go “to the moon.” The Bitcoin advocate assumed that such progress would rely heavily on Shibarium’s advancement. “I like Shiba Inu, as you know, and I think it will do relatively well in this cycle, but it may not go as high as you expect. I think Shiba Inu has a lot of utility now that they have Shibarium, and basically, it’s a chain that you can actually run all kinds of applications. However, nobody is using it, and there are no applications for using your tokens on Shibarium yet. If they get that solved, Shiba Inu will go to the moon,” he said. At the beginning of the year, the layer-2 scaling solution gained attention for handling millions of transactions each day . By February, the total transactions on the network exceeded 900 million. However, in recent weeks, Shibarium’s activity has slowed significantly.

That's less than the realized price of $134 for the first time since May 2022, according to Glassnode data. The realized price is the average cost basis of all coins last moved and current values mean the average holder is underwater, a bearish signal that can trigger panic selling or capitulation. The drop comes as Solana’s validators debate a proposal known as SIMD-0228 that could slash the network’s 4.7% annual inflation rate by 80% to roughly 1.5% over time. Unlike the market price, which fluctuates with exchange trades, realized price is a cost-basis anchor. The price action forms a descending channel, with resistance between $134, formerly a support level, and $130, and support at $120 and $115. The trend remains bearish, but if $120 holds and $128 breaks with volume, a rebound to $134 is possible, driven by dip buyers.",Markets|Markets|market analysis|Solana,EN,0,0,SOL|TRADING|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-11 12:13:25

Primarily, a section of users has expressed their decision to sell their accounts, as they have found it difficult to digest the long lockup period policy. Secondly, some users have faced certain serious technical issues while attempting to migrate to the mainnet. Unsurprisingly, the PI price has dropped by around 20.6% in the last seven days. Here is everything you should know. Growing Frustration Over Pi Network Lockups Pi Network has no less than 11.5 million accounts. At least 62.6% of the total number of accounts in the network remains locked for three years. This implies that the coins in these accounts can be traded only after the next three years. Accounts with shorter lockup periods are fewer in number. Around 1.1 million accounts remain locked for 6 months, and nearly 1.6 million for a year. Rise in Account Sales to Bypass Lockups Account sales are a strategy adopted by frustrated pioneers to overcome the long lockup period issue. Many pioneers have used their social media handles to sell their Pi Network holdings. A post on X by Pending Ustaz reads : “A friend has 2.136 PI for sale. The PI is locked until 2027. If you buy, you will receive the passphrase, which grants full access to the wallet.” A simple Google search for “ sell locked PI ” shows numerous listings from users trying to cash out. Security & Fraud Risks for Buyers and Sellers Pi Network does not permit selling user accounts. There is a chance that the network will invalidate the illegally sold accounts. There is also a possibility that fraudsters will use the opportunity to defraud PI Network users. Importantly, sharing passphrases recklessly could severely affect the security framework of the entire network. Mainnet Migration Issues Add to User Frustration The final grace period to migrate to the mainnet and to complete the KYC procedure is scheduled to end on March 14. Not all pioneers have successfully completed the process. Some have suffered technical errors during the process. Many have called for the extension of the migration deadline. PI Coin Faces Heavy Losses Amid Bearish Sentiment It is uncertain whether it is wise to give another extension to the deadline. The PI market is already in trouble. In the last 14 days, the PI price has seen a drop of 12.4%. In the last seven days alone, the market has plummeted by over 20%. On February 20, the price of PI was $1.84%. Currently, the price stands at $1.39 – at least 110.79% below the ATH of $2.93. In conclusion, Pi Network users are losing patience, and many are turning to unauthorised account sales. While some seek a quick exit, security risks and potential bans loom large. Meanwhile, the PI price continues to fall, raising doubts about the project’s future. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

41479233,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=386856,1741695756,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/41479233.jpeg,"22,702 BTC Flow to Exchanges: What History Tells Us About the Current Bitcoin Downtrend",https://cryptopotato.com/22702-btc-flow-to-exchanges-what-history-tells-us-about-the-current-bitcoin-downtrend/,"The crypto market’s recent pullback has rattled investors, with Bitcoin and altcoins experiencing sharp declines. While volatility remains a concern, fundamental indicators suggest a potential turnaround could be on the horizon. Bitcoin is currently on a seven-week slump after reaching an all-time high of approximately $109,000 on January 19 this year. This decline followed months of aggressive accumulation by whale and shark addresses after Donald Trump’s election victory in November 2024, which catalyzed a surge in investor confidence and network growth. The Return of Whale Accumulation According to Santiment’s latest insights , wallet creation spiked, as noted by the emergence of a whopping 2.51 million new Bitcoin addresses in just one week post-election. This was indicative of increased retail and institutional interest. However, accumulation slowed significantly after Trump’s inauguration which led to a profit-taking event on February 19. This eventually culminated in a steady decline in Bitcoin’s price as it hit a low of $77,000 this week. Adding to the bearish pressure, a net move of 22,702 BTC flowed from non-exchange wallets to exchanges between February 20 and March 8, a trend Santiment notes as a common precursor to sell-offs and increased volatility. Despite this downturn, an important counter-signal has emerged – high-capital BTC wallets have begun accumulating again since March 3, yet the market has continued to slide. Historically, when key stakeholders buy amid severe pessimism, it has often signaled an impending market bottom. Market Sentiment, Altcoin Performance, and the Road Ahead Social sentiment metrics further validate this outlook. Analyzing the prevalence of Bitcoin price predictions on social media, Santiment observed a growing imbalance between bullish and bearish forecasts. Currently, mentions of sub-$69,000 price targets significantly outweigh those predicting six-figure valuations, which suggests a shift toward extreme fear among retail traders. Historically, markets tend to move against the majority consensus, implying that Bitcoin may be nearing a reversal as panic-driven selling reaches its peak. Furthermore, Bitcoin traders who have been active in the past 30 days are down an average of 11%, while those in the past year are at a 5% deficit. Although not yet in historically extreme negative zones, these losses indicate that risk is diminishing compared to typical market conditions. Broader altcoin markets have suffered even steeper declines, as seen with Ethereum, and Solana which were down by 29%, and 40% respectively, along with meme coins such as Dogecoin and Pepe experiencing 38-39% drawdowns. However, the cyclical nature of crypto suggests that such deep corrections are often followed by strong recoveries. While macroeconomic headwinds, including concerns over Trump’s tariffs and a potential trade war, may contribute to ongoing turbulence, Santiment added that the structural forces of accumulation, extreme trader pain, and widespread FUD are aligning in favor of a potential market rebound. The crypto analytic platform, however, noted that the path forward may still be rocky in the short term. “So in short, the sky is not falling in crypto. We may see a bit more turbulence due to macroeconomic and global concerns, such as equity and crypto traders’ concerns related to Trump’s tariffs and an impending growing trade war beginning to emerge. But with key stakeholders beginning to accumulate once again, traders already in serious pain, and FUD becoming increasingly loud on social media, we are seeing positive signs beginning to emerge.” The post 22,702 BTC Flow to Exchanges: What History Tells Us About the Current Bitcoin Downtrend appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Bitcoin (BTC) Price|Donald Trump,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-03-11 12:22:36

Ethereum has become the biggest victim of the volatility, as its price declined to a multi-month low of $17.8k earlier in the day. However, even in this downtrend, one crypto trader turned the bear zone into a lucrative opportunity, making $2.15M within just an hour. How? Let’s discuss this. Crypto Trader’s Bold Move in the Crypto Market Crash Pays Off While most investors drowned in the crypto market downturn , one investor made a daring move. With a smart strategy, this person sold their 947 ETH for $1.95M USDC. After this, they deposited these into Hyperliquid, a decentralized perpetual trading platform. More importantly, rather than holding these USDC like most cautious traders, they longed ETH with 50x leverage, significantly amplifying the position. Soon, this position grew to 25,096 ETH, equivalent to $53.7M, with a liquidation price of $2,008. As Ethereum’s price quickly rebounded, the person excited the leveraged long position. By doing so, they made $2.15M in profits in just 50 minutes. However, this was not easy, as the crypto trader made a risky bet, especially in this volatile space. If the trade has not gone well, the trader could have lost $1.95 million, the entire initial investment. With such a high level of precision, the community questions if it’s an insider or expert. Crypto Trader Also Made $6.8M: Insider or an Expert? Interestingly, this is not the first time this crypto investor has made headlines. Just earlier, this investor made millions by leveraging both BTC and ETH by putting its trades around Donald Trump’s Executive Order. Even then, the trader executed leverage positions, earning $6.8M per Lookonchain post . The precision was so accurate that this person flourished in gains even in the crypto market crash. Such accurate market prediction has led to speculation. Some believe they are an insider, while others attribute the success to calculated risk-taking and market expertise. Bottom Line The current crypto market condition is not entirely favorable for high profits, but this crypto trader proved this point of view wrong. The trader made a risky bet and leveraged Ethereum, making $2.15M within less than an hour. Interestingly, this is not the first time, and probably not the last. On-chain records show this crypto investor has made millions in the last few days alone. However, not all trades go in the same direction. Investors must research and trade cautiously rather than succumb to FOMO and lose everything from such stories.

Financial Collapse Hits as Markets Crash,https://coinpedia.org/news/robert-kiyosaki-was-right-financial-collapse-hits-as-markets-crash/,"The post Robert Kiyosaki Was Right! Financial Collapse Hits as Markets Crash appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Financial markets have always been prone to cycles of boom and bust, but when a crash hits, it can wipe out trillions in wealth within days. A bloodbath today , with over $1.9 trillion wiped out from the stock and crypto markets causing extreme fear in market. This is the largest market drop since March 2020, when the pandemic sparked a historic crash. Historically, market crashes are fueled by a mix of economic uncertainty, poor monetary policies, and shifting investor sentiment. The recent downturn has been no exception, with stocks and cryptocurrencies suffering massive losses . Investors who were once riding the highs of a bullish market are now facing extreme fear. Amid this chaos, one voice has stood out—Robert Kiyosaki, the author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, who had long warned about this very scenario. Kiyosaki Saw It Coming—Now His Warning Rings Loud Kiyosaki has been predicting a major financial collapse for years , citing unsustainable debt levels and reckless monetary policies. Many dismissed his warnings as fear-mongering, but his prophecy has now come true. The Nasdaq saw its worst drop since 2022, erasing over $1.7 trillion in market value, while the crypto market was hit hard , with Bitcoin briefly plunging to $76,000 and Ethereum dropping below $1,800. Within 24 hours, the crypto sector lost over $940 million. What Triggered the Collapse? While many initially blamed geopolitical tensions and economic policies under Trump’s second presidency, analysts like The Kobeissi Letter suggest that the real cause lies in shifting investor sentiment. The market transitioned from greed to extreme fear in just months. Additionally, institutional shorting, massive fund outflows, and regulatory uncertainty over Bitcoin reserves contributed to the crash. Buy the Dip or Brace for More Pain? While fear dominates the market, experts suggest this downturn could be temporary. Institutional activity, regulatory updates, and macroeconomic shifts will likely dictate the next move. For now, investors must decide—panic or prepare for what could be the next big opportunity in financial markets. Despite the panic, Kiyosaki sees this as an opportunity for those who are prepared. He urges investors to buy hard assets like gold, silver, and Bitcoin, calling them safe havens against failing financial systems. He warns against relying on ETFs, claiming they are as “fake as the U.S. dollar.” He believes Bitcoin could eventually reach $10 million, while gold and silver could surge to $15,000 and $110 per ounce, respectively. On the flip side, Crypto analyst Jacob King believes the crypto market is still in its early stages but heavily manipulated. He argues that over 87% of the market is built on fake volume and artificial hype, setting the stage for a brutal collapse. As Bitcoin dipped below $80K, he warned that a massive sell-off is incoming, predicting BTC could crash below $10K when panic sets in. According to him, most investors won’t see it coming until it’s too late. With uncertainty looming, investors must decide—panic, or position themselves for the next financial move.

ONDO Price Plummets 60% with No Floor in Sight,https://cryptonews.com/news/ondo-price-plummets-60-with-no-floor-in-sight-time-to-worry/,"While the past week showed promising upside attempts, like most top-performing altcoins , the Ondo price has struggled under broader economic pressures. Trump’s “tariff war,” NATO tensions, and rising global bond yields have made buzzwords like “stagflation” and “recession” all too common—a cause for concern for RWA tokens like Ondo. Recent hours do see some relief. A bounce from $0.74, backed by a 25.27% surge in trading volume to $320 million, has sparked hopes of a “buy the dip” event, but it’s too early to confirm a sustained recovery. Ondo Price Analysis: Is a Bottom in Sight? Today’s rebound confirms the lower support of a descending channel that has dictated price movements throughout the decline. ONDO / USDT 1D chart, descending channel. Source: Binance. While the price has bounced, the retest has yet to prove decisive, with technical indicators hanging in the balance. The MACD line continues to trend sideways, crossing briefly above and below the signal line, while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) struggles to escape oversold conditions near 30. Although an RSI uptrend appears to be forming, recovery to a neutral 50 remains uncertain as the bulls seem reluctant. If bullish momentum persists, Ondo could climb to retest the channel’s upper resistance, potentially breaking out toward $1.55—a 60% gain from current levels. Conversely, with conditions still fragile, broader economic pressures could trigger another drop, risking a further 50% decline to a bottom of $0.42. This ICO Helps Hedge Against Altcoin Declines Any trader hedging their risk likely features Bitcoin (BTC) as a major part of their portfolio, especially as the altcoin market continues to fall. While Bitcoin provides stable gains, it often sacrifices upside potential—that’s where Bitcoin Bull (BTCBULL) comes in, offering a fresh way to capitalize on BTC tailwinds. True to its name, Bitcoin Bull ties its tokenomics to Bitcoin’s price growth in a deflationary model. The project burns tokens and distributes BTC airdrops whenever Bitcoin reaches key milestones—starting at $125,000 and triggering new rewards for every $25,000 climb thereafter. With some analysts forecasting BTC highs of $250,000 this cycle, BTCBULL could become a Bitcoin Maxi’s best friend. With almost $3.5 million raised in its initial weeks, the project is already gaining strong momentum—potentially credited to its 123% APY on staking that rewards early investors.

Rollblock is making waves in the $450 billion gaming industry by using blockchain technology to eliminate fraud and scams. This innovative approach has positioned the protocol as a leader in the GameFi sector, attracting significant attention from players and investors. Many investors believe that if Rollblock maintains this momentum, RBLK could outperform both Cronos and Pepe in 2025, reinforcing its position as one of the most promising tokens of the year. PEPE Price Prediction: Will The Memecoin Drop Even Further? Pepe has extended its weekly losses to 25%, trading below the key support level of $0.000005921. The whole memecoin market dropped more than 8.3% in the past 24 hours, reaching a total market cap of $47 billion. As per IntoTheBlock data, Pepe’s network activity has plummeted, with active addresses dropping from 28,000 at its post-election high of $0.00002836 to just 2,573 the lowest level since before the election rally. This decline signals weakening investor confidence and raises the risk of further losses. TradingView data shows no signs of accumulation, as each price drop has triggered increased selling pressure. Despite this, trading volume increased by 105.5% leaving $0.000005961 as a fragile support zone. Adding to the pressure, a whale wallet holding between 100 million and 1 billion PEPE has begun offloading tokens per Santiment data. This sell-off aligns with Pepe’s 77% drop from its post-election peak, erasing earlier gains. Pepe faces increasing downside pressure with weakening network activity and capital shifting into mid and low-cap meme coins. Cronos to Reissue 70 Billion Tokens Cronos remains under pressure, struggling to break the key $0.10 resistance after retracing all gains from its November rally. Despite a slight increase in Cronos OI from Coinglass , overall speculative activity remains low as traders wait for clearer signs of a trend shift. Cronos’ DEX activity, however, is showing strength. DefiLlama data shows that weekly volume jumped 140% to $123.2 million, with VVS Finance, Cronos’ largest DEX, contributing $92 million. This surge has boosted the VVS token’s price, reflecting growing interest in the Cronos ecosystem despite broader market hesitation. Controversy surrounds a proposal to reissue 70 billion CRO tokens, raising the total supply to 100 billion. The tokens would be locked for five years and used to fund ecosystem growth, including potential investments in ETFs backed by Cronos. However, the proposal has sparked backlash over dilution and centralization concerns. Voting remains close, with 50.92% supporting it and 48.56% opposing it. The outcome depends on reaching the 33.40% quorum by the March 17 deadline. Rollbock’s Presale Attracts 60,000 Early Investors Rollblock’s presale has been a major success, raising $11 million from over 60,000 early investors across ten rounds. RBLK has surged over 610%, reaching $0.061, with some predicting it could hit $1 soon. This strong performance positions Rollblock ahead of altcoins like Pepe and Cronos. Rollblock’s growth comes from its innovative approach to gaming. It offers over 7,000 AI-powered games on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring secure and transparent gameplay. Every outcome is recorded on-chain, making fraud and manipulation nearly impossible. Players can enjoy live dealers and sports betting with full confidence in the platform’s fairness. RBLK’s deflationary tokenomics have also fueled its rise. With a fixed supply of 1 billion tokens, RBLK powers transaction fees, staking, and rewards. Up to 30% of Rollblock’s revenue is allocated to token buybacks, with 60% of repurchased tokens burned and 40% distributed as staking rewards. What Makes Rollblock Attractive for Crypto Investors? Rollblock’s presale has drawn significant attention, with over 60,000 early investors, including well-known Web3 figures like Crypto Nautic , getting involved. The growing excitement around Rollblock isn’t just about its price surge but also its future prospects. Many investors are praising its strong fundamentals and innovative approach to gaming, positioning it as a standout in the GameFi sector. Adding to the momentum, this month’s 50% presale bonus has created even more incentive for new buyers, further driving demand. Learn more about the Rollblock (RBLK) Presale.

Data from DeFiLlama reveals that Solana’s weekly network revenue has plunged from a record $55.3 million in mid-January to just $4 million—marking a staggering 93% decline. The blockchain’s decentralized application (DApp) revenue has also taken a massive hit, dropping 86% from $238 million to $32 million in the same timeframe. The downturn is not limited to revenue alone—Solana’s total value locked (TVL) in DeFi has nearly halved, slipping from $12 billion in January to around $6.4 billion today. Analysts point to the sharp decline in memecoin trading volume as the primary reason for this downturn. A March 5 report by VanEck suggests that around 80% of Solana’s network revenue comes from memecoin speculation, particularly from the trading platform Pump.fun. However, the platform’s daily revenue has nosedived 95% from a peak of $15 million in late January to just $800,000 on March 7, according to Dune Analytics. Trump’s Memecoin Sparked the Peak—Then the Crash The January launch of Trump-themed memecoins appears to have marked the peak of the craze. On January 18, Donald Trump’s TRUMP token launched , followed by Melania Trump’s MELANIA token two days later. While both tokens initially surged in price, the excitement was short-lived. CoinGecko founder Bobby Ong noted on March 6 that the Trump-themed tokens diverted liquidity and attention away from other memecoins, effectively marking the beginning of their decline. TRUMP has since dropped 86% from its peak, now trading at $10.50, while MELANIA has collapsed 95% to just $0.71. Solana Price Takes a Hit The broader memecoin market has also suffered a heavy blow, with its total market capitalization falling 68% from a peak of $137 billion in December to $44 billion today, per CoinMarketCap data . With memecoin interest drying up , Solana price has followed suit, falling 58% from its mid-January all-time high of $293. At the time of writing, SOL is down another 5% on the day, trading at $122. While Solana remains a dominant player in the blockchain space, its heavy reliance on memecoins for network activity has exposed its vulnerability to speculative hype cycles.

In a March 11 post on X, the executive, known as “Quit,” pushed back against analysts who suggested $1,500 as the possible bottom for Ether ( ETH ). Instead, Quit argued that a true bear market could see ETH fall significantly lower, similar to previous market cycles. “A true bear market target, if we’re just getting started, would be ~$200-$400. That’s an 80% drawdown from here, 90% total drawdown -- in line with past bear markets.” The executive said he’s in a “comfortable” position if things go south. Quit told followers to consider selling their stash if they’re uncomfortable with the asset going down. Source: Quit ETH holders discuss potential price trajectory Quit’s post drew mixed reactions from the crypto community. Some investors agreed that ETH could drop further, while others said such a scenario would require a major systemic collapse. One X user said they set $1,800 as the bottom. However, when the price reached $1,800, they contemplated whether it could go to $1,200. The ETH holder agreed with Quit’s prediction and said, “It could very well go lower” if Bitcoin ( BTC ) goes to $66,000. Meanwhile, another X user disagreed with the prediction, saying it would only be possible if there were a systemic collapse similar to 2018. The ETH investor said that, unlike previous cycles, Ether has been adopted by institutions and has a maturing ecosystem. “Positioning for both scenarios is what every smart investor should done, but being too bearish at the wrong time can cost just as much as being overly bullish,” they wrote. Related: 4 things must happen before Ethereum can reclaim $2,600 ETH whales scramble against liquidation threat Quit’s sentiments came as ETH whales scrambled to avoid liquidation as Ether prices collapsed. On March 11, CoinGecko data showed that ETH prices went to a low of $1,791 on a 22% decline in the past seven days. Because of the sharp price changes, ETH whales moved millions of dollars in ETH to protect their positions against potential liquidation. Blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain flagged an ETH whale dumping $47.8 million and losing $32 million to avoid being liquidated. The whale still has over $64 million at the lending protocol Aave with a liquidation price of $1,316. Another ETH investor who had already used over $5 million in assets to lower the liquidation price to $1,836 started to be liquidated. Lookonchain said the whale’s $121 million balance was being liquidated as the price dropped below $1,800. A whale account suspected of being linked to the Ethereum Foundation also used $56 million in ETH to avoid liquidation amid the price drop. The address deposited over 30,000 ETH to the Sky vault, bringing its liquidation price to $1.127.14. The account was later determined to be unrelated to the foundation .

Despite the hawkish outlook, Dan Gambardello, a prominent analyst, has called Cardano to a $100 billion market cap. Here are the key reasons he believes Cardano is poised for a notable breakthrough. Cardano’s path to $100 billion market cap Citing historical price patterns, important technical formations, and basic ecosystem development, crypto researcher Dan Gambardello is still certain that Cardano (ADA) is ready for a significant breakthrough. In just 19 months, ADA’s value rose by 8,236%, from $1.22 billion in March 2020 to nearly $101 billion in September 2021. This historical precedent prepares the ground for yet another significant rise, as present market movements reflect past accumulation phases before explosive expansion. ADA trades at $0.66 at the time of writing, down 42% from its recent peak. However, experts view this as a required retraction within a bigger bull cycle. Cardano price chart (24-Hour), February 27, 2025 | Source: CoinGecko The inverted head-and-shoulders pattern on the weekly chart is among the strongest evidence bolstering ADA’s optimistic view. Historically, this pattern indicates a significant breakthrough; ADA is now positioned between the 20-week and 200-week moving averages, a critical accumulation zone before past rallies. Furthermore, Fibonacci retracement levels confirm that ADA is poised for a surge, matching prior “bull market doors” from previous cycles. Analysts believe that ADA might enter a multi-year rally if the breakout is verified. The DeFi ecosystem for the Cardano network has expanded rapidly as more smart contracts are adopted and total value locked (TVL). Cardano’s recent elevation to Bitwise’s Top 10 Crypto Index indicates increasing institutional interest in ADA. However, the most significant potential stimulus for ADA is the introduction of spot ETFs. Grayscale has already filed for a Cardano ETF, and if approved, ADA might experience a rise comparable to Bitcoin and Ethereum’s post-ETF adoption. Cardano’s price would need to rise to $10 to reach a $100 billion market capitalization. Analysts believe that if market circumstances improve, ADA will increase to $5 or $10, with a higher objective of $14 if momentum accelerates. Given Cardano’s solid fundamentals, Gambardello believes it can follow a trajectory similar to Ethereum’s previous cycle, during which its market capitalization approached $500 billion. While Cardano (ADA) is still far from reaching the $100 billion milestone, Rexas Finance (RXS) is dominating the real-world asset (RWA) tokenization trend. With its presale nearing conclusion ($0.20), market watchers are tipping RXS as the next big mover. Rexas Finance (RXS): the rising utility coin is set for massive gains Rexas Finance allows investors to acquire fractional real estate shares, commodities, and financial assets by tokenizing them. For example, an investor looking to gain exposure to commercial real estate would normally need millions of dollars to purchase the entire property. With RXS-powered tokenization, the same investor can hold a fraction of the property as a blockchain-based token, assuring seamless, transparent, and cost-effective ownership. The global RWA tokenization market is expected to reach $50 billion by 2025 and $16 trillion by 2030, establishing Rexas Finance as a pioneer in this fast-expanding field. Rexas Finance features that set it apart RXS is more than simply a token; it is a multi-utility platform. Some of its more appealing aspects include: Rexas Token builder & QuickMint bot: allows no-code token creation and quick asset tokenization over Telegram and Discord. Rexas launchpad: a funding platform that enables crypto entrepreneurs to raise funds using RXS as the primary fundraising instrument. Rexas DeFi suite: staking, yield farming, and governance tools enable holders to make passive revenue while safeguarding the network. Rexas AI shield: with an AI-driven security mechanism, Certik-audited smart contracts, and automated risk detection, RXS remains one of the safest cryptocurrency investments. The Rexas Finance presale has become one of the most sought-after events in the cryptocurrency sector. Investors line up to secure their stake before the project’s planned major exchange debut. The presale, which began in September 2024, has already finished 11 stages ahead of schedule, with Stage 12 (the Final Stage) currently 90% sold out. As of this writing, RXS is selling at $0.20, up 566% from its Stage 1 price of $0.03. This demand indicates investors’ trust in RXS’s real-world applications and potential to revolutionize blockchain-based asset tokenization. Moreover, Rexas Finance offers a $1 million giveaway to reward early adopters. Twenty winners will each receive $50,000 in RXS. This program is intended to increase adoption and reward early supporters before the formal exchange launch. Meanwhile, investors keenly anticipate Rexas Finance’s official launch on exchanges by June 19th. The coin will be listed on at least three of the world’s top ten exchanges at $0.25 per RXS. Given the huge demand, liquidity spike, and historical trends of newly listed utility tokens, analysts anticipate a parabolic rise in RXS following its introduction. With Wall Street investors’ growing interest in the RWA tokenization market, Rexas Finance might hit the $100 billion mark faster than Cardano, making it one of the top altcoins to buy in 2025. The best bet for growth and utility in 2025 Thanks to strong fundamentals, a quickly expanding DeFi ecosystem, and institutional adoption, Cardano (ADA) is on course for a $100 billion market capitalization. ADA could rise to $5 or even $10 if market conditions are favorable this cycle. However, emergent high-utility coins such as Rexas Finance (RXS) provide the most possibilities for exponential growth. With a thriving presale, a thorough security audit, and a significant exchange listing on the horizon, RXS represents one of the best investment prospects in 2025. Secure your RXS tokens before the presale ends—don’t miss out on the next major crypto revolution!

Investors' pains have been compounded in the last few weeks as the Ethereum price keeps dropping below major supports, and the recent drop might indicate a bigger drop yet to come. Similarly, the PEPE coin has continued wiping out its profit from the 2024 bull run, dropping over 70% since the year's opening. But where could the money move as the top altcoins and meme coins continue showing drastic price drops? A recent analysis shows a new PayFi coin getting most of the ETHwhales' money, showing a high prospect token. Could this be the new way to move? Here is the breakdown. Ethereum Price Breakout And Direction This Year While Ethereum's recent inclusion in the crypto market is seen from a bullish point of view across the market, its reaction has been mostly bearish. Taking a technical approach to the analysis, the Ethereum price has broken below three significant supports in the last few months since the year began. These are the supports at $2900, $2300, and $2000, with the most recent breaking below $2000 today to trade at a low of $1991. However, while fundamental factors continue to build up bullish sentiments, the technical analysis of the Ethereum price keeps showing further drops. An analysis of the Ethereum price using the latest developments as a determinant shows that the price could see a breakout to the upside in the coming months. Meanwhile, this is merely speculative as the whale wallet tracker shows the whales continue moving out funds by the day. Why PEPE Coin Investors Keep Dropping Out The re-emergence of Donald Trump in the white in January this year came with a wild meme coin rush. This includes new memes that carry the president's endorsement, such as the Trump coin. However, while the new meme coins saw a big surge, with some reaching as high as 20x within a few days, the old players like PEPE were primarily bearish. This has led to the hypothesis that the new memes drive attention away from the old ones. However, PEPE price 's 72% drop in the last 90 days has also prompted a new theory that its investors are now moving to a better utility token. While this revelation is not new, it is projected to drive an even more bearish downturn for the PEPE coin as more investors continue to take action. Is Remittix A Long-Term Investment Bet? The Remittix new presale token has been identified as the primary asset receiving the most funds from the ETH and PEPE whales. However, while this new token continues to make waves as the top presale option in the market, is there a long-term prospect for the coin after its presale? The Remittix exchange has been fueling the optimism around the Remittix token in presale. This is because of the long-term projection of the Remittix exchange's influence on the crypto market, as analysts believe the exchange could drive the higher adoption of the token. The Remittix presale token has become a sensation in the last few months, raising over $13.8M and selling more than 517M tokens in the presale. Investors' optimism around this new token could make it a major contender to the top altcoins in the coming months. However, while the ETH whales have been noticed to be joining this new token in droves, new investors' actions have also continued to surge. The Remittix solution in the crypto market has much to unpack, but you can read more about this innovative asset online. Right now, the best step for any investor is to catch the Remittixtoken while it's still in presale. With the price at $0.0734, investors can earn during and after the presale.

The Trump Organization claims the closures caused millions of dollars worth of financial damages and were part of the “debanking” trend fronted by the Biden administration. The lawsuit, filed in a Florida state court on Friday, alleges that Capital One arbitrarily terminated over 300 accounts linked to the Trump Organization in June 2021. The accounts reportedly held millions of dollars at the time. The decision, according to the lawsuit, severely disrupted financial operations across the organization’s properties, tenants, and employees. “ By filing this lawsuit, we seek to hold Capital One accountable for the millions of dollars in damages they caused, not just to our company, but to the many dozens of properties, hundreds of tenants, and thousands of Trump Organization employees who relied on these accounts for their livelihoods, ” the company said in a statement. Capital One denies allegations, Eric Trump says more will follow According to the New York Times, a spokesperson for Capital One refuted the Trump Organization’s claims, stating that the bank does not have any cases of closing accounts solely based on political views. “ Capital One has not and does not close customer accounts for political reasons ,” the spokesperson said in response to the court filings. The Trump Organization’s lawsuit claims the bank’s actions fit a pattern seen during the previous administration’s tenure, where institutions have distanced themselves from Trump, his wife Melania, and their businesses since January 6, 2021, when the infamous US Capitol riots happened. After the events of January 6, Trump’s family insists that several major banks severed ties with Trump and his business empire. Deutsche Bank and Signature Bank were among the financial institutions that supposedly “stopped working” with him in early 2021. The Trump Organization says it was informed on March 8, 2021, that its accounts would be closed by June of that year. But, at the time of the closures, Trump’s business was also under multiple investigations. The Manhattan district attorney’s office had subpoenaed financial records, while New York state prosecutors were questioning employees from Deutsche Bank and other institutions. The Trump Organization’s long-time accounting firm was also being investigated for fraudulent activities. Eric Trump, who leads the Trump Organization and is a plaintiff in the case, said the lawsuit against Capital One might be “just the beginning” of a series of legal actions taken against institutions that took part in the “debanking” claims.. “ More to come ,” he said in a statement on March 7. Law expert says Capital One could ‘easily’ win against Trump Organization Adam Levitin, a Georgetown Law professor specializing in financial regulation, wrote in a blog post that Capital One should “easily” win the case if it fights it in court. Still, he noted that the bank might prefer to settle because of President Trump’s political influence. “ If Capital One doesn’t pay up, the implicit threat is that the Trump administration will move to block the Capital One-Discover merger and generally make life unpleasant for Capital One, ” Levitin wrote. “ The real question here is whether Capital One is going to fight this, and, if so, how hard,” he added . “ Capital One should win this one if it litigates, but it will likely come at the cost of their merger with Discover. Paying a few million to the Trump Organization in a settlement is a very low cost for greasing the wheels for the merger .” The issue of “debanking” has become sort of a political pivot for Washington’s top office, with Trump himself publicly addressing it after returning to the White House in January. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Trump confronted Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan about right wing-aligned businesses allegedly being denied banking services. “ I hope you start opening your bank to conservatives because many conservatives complain that the banks are not allowing them to do business within the bank, and that includes a place called Bank of America ,” Trump said. He also acknowledged that regulatory pressure under President Joe Biden’s administration may have contributed to banks distancing themselves from conservative customers. “ I don’t know if the regulators mandated that because of Biden or what, but you and JPMorgan Chase’s Jamie and everybody, I hope you’re going to open your banks to conservatives because what you’re doing is wrong ,” Trump told Moynihan.

Established names like Ethereum, Cardano, and Solana are having a hard time since the start of 2025. Even meme coins including Shiba Inu are failing to outperform amidst concerns they’ve already had their moment in the sun. Still, the native RTX token continues to attract strong demand during the presale phase as it aims at offering something more than the likes of SOL, ETH, ADA, and SHIB. How does Remittix compare with Ethereum? Ethereum is broadly known as the pioneer of smart contracts but years into its debut in the crypto space, the decentralised blockchain is still struggling with scalability. Plus, transaction costs remain prohibitive during peak usage periods, and network congestion persists. On the other hand, RTX was designed with scalability in mind. It’s committed to surpassing ETH in terms of transaction throughput while maintaining significantly lower fees. That makes Remittix more suitable for everyday transactions and microtransactions in DeFi applications. How does RTX compare with ADA RTX may be a more exciting investment for this year compared to ADA despite its scientific approach to blockchain development because Cardano’s pace continues to frustrate investors. While it’s making them wait for complete feature implementation, Remittix is focused on striking a balance between methodical development and practical implementation. Remittix is committed to delivering functioning products while maintaining security standards comparable to Cardano. This agility positions RTX for quicker adaptation to market demands and emerging opportunities. How does Remittix compare with Solana? Solana has long been praised for its impressive speed, but the relatively centralised validator structure and occasional network outages remain a reason for criticism. Remittix , on the other hand, aims at achieving comparable performance metrics while maintaining a more distributed validator network, enhancing both security and resistance to censorship. Plus, the RTX consensus mechanism is designed for energy-efficiency. It requires materially less computational power, which makes it more environmentally sustainable as well. How does RTX compare with SHIB? RTX coin may be a superior investment than SHIB for 2025 as it doesn’t drive its value only from community sentiment and speculative trading like the latter. Remittix offers genuine utility through its integrated payment solutions, cross-chain compatibility, and real-world application partnerships. While meme coins may generate short-term gains, RTX’s foundation in practical use cases provides a more stable long-term value proposition backed by technological innovation rather than market hype. The bottom line Remittix’s innovative approach to interoperability has helped it raise more than $13 million already during the presale. While other tokens often operate within their ecosystems, RTX seamlessly bridges multiple blockchain networks, functioning as a versatile cross-chain solution. This positions Remittix not as a competitor to existing cryptocurrencies, but as a complementary technology that enhances the entire crypto ecosystem. For investors, seeking a balanced combination of innovative technology, practical utility, scalability, and most of the growth ahead instead of in the rearview, Remittix presents a compelling alternative to both established names like ETH, ADA, SOL, and SHIB.

That has created uncertainty in the SHIB community, prompting increasing numbers of investors to diversify into other best new crypto assets with more promising prospects. Let’s find out what’s happening. Shiba Inu price returns to last year's Q4 lows SHIB has been on a moribund streak for three consecutive months, and appears to be continuing its poor performance in March. After dropping the ball at $0.000033 in December last year, the second-largest meme coin has collapsed over 60%, trickling down to negate all its Q4 gains. Source: CoinMarketCap CoinMarketCap data reveals that SHIB has been squashed by over 19% in the past month, aggravating its yearly losses to 65% in a volatile crypto market that has pushed the Bitcoin price down to the $80k zone. The prolonged bearish wave has crashed the Shiba Inu price to vital monthly support near $0.00001. This is the same buying zone where SHIB rocketed from toward Q4 last year, and a return has sparked wild market speculations and bullish Shiba Inu price predictions. Shiba Inu price prediction for 2025: How high can SHIB rise this year? Though CoinCodex's Shiba Inu price predictions show SHIB might crash further in the short-term, the meme coin is forecasted to blast over 300% to above $0.00005. But Benzinga predictions are more conservative, predicting a modest 74% rally toward the $0.000032 region. These bullish Shiba Inu price predictions come amid the launch of gasless transactions on Shibarium, a network improvement likely to attract new users and drive user engagement on the Shiba Inu network. The skyrocketing SHIB burn rate adds to the bullish outlook as the SHIB community torches over 32.8 million tokens, demonstrating their commitment to deplete the meme coin's huge circulating supply. Shiba Inu may not be the best crypto to buy As SHIB struggles with bearish pressure, investors are beginning to rethink their strategies, piling into other best new crypto tokens tipped for gigantic returns. Rollblock (RBLK), a new GambleFi protocol on Ethereum, has emerged as the star of the show, and a fortune is being poured into it. Rollblock’s irresistible revenue sharing model is the key factor driving SHIB investors crazy. Every week, this iGaming powerhouse sets apart up to 30% of its weekly gaming revenues for RBLK toke repurchases. A portion of the acquired token pile is burned out of supply, diminishing the 1 billion RBLK supply over time, while the rest are redistributed to token holders as staking rewards. This makes RBLK a passive income-yielding, deflationary crypto asset whose market value and price look set to trend upwards. Furthermore, this iGaming dApp is set to revolutionize the $540 billion gambling market with a hybrid infrastructure model casino that offers fiat & crypto betting solutions. Again, the casino supports AI and copy betting strategies, positioning it to disrupt and dominate this massive empire. Capturing even a tiny share of this treasure chest of cash would be sufficient to make Rollblock a multibillion iGaming platform on Ethereum , sending the RBLK price to lofty heights. Grab the best new crypto As SHIB investors nurse a more than 60% year-to-date loss, RBLK first movers are swimming with a gigantic 510% presale return as the ICO collects nearly $11 million in investment capital. Yet, analysts anticipate the altcoin to stage another 370% rally before the ICO ends, and might pull a 50x multiplier once launched on tier-1 exchanges later this year. It’s not hard to see why analysts are extolling RBLK as the best new crypto asset to scoop in the ICO market right now. Book your RBLK ticket at the $0.061 bargain price.

One notable contender, Panshibi (SHIBI) , is making waves with the surging interest in its bonus offer. As DOGE experiences a pullback, market watchers are evaluating whether this shift signals a long-term trend or a temporary adjustment. This article explains how SHIBI’s rise compares to DOGE’s current movement. Panshibi Surge: Grab Your 20% Bonus Before the Presale Closes Panshibi is on track to storm forward and investors now have the perfect opportunity to jump in with a 20% bonus. This limited-time offer is making waves, attracting new buyers eager to secure extra tokens as the presale heats up. With demand soaring, this gives investors a valuable edge before the SHIBI token officially hits major exchanges. The meme coin’s viral momentum, combined with its innovative social-fi and meme-fi features, is creating a buzz across the crypto space. Investors aren't just getting in on a meme coin for fun; they’re participating in a dynamic ecosystem where users can earn rewards through challenges and community engagement. Furthermore, with Panshibi gaining major traction in the Asian market, it’s quickly building global momentum. Large buys continue to pour in, signaling strong support from both whales and retail investors. As the presale progresses, the token’s price is set to rise, making the 20% bonus an even more attractive offer for those looking to maximize their investments. In addition to the buzz, Panshibi’s connection to Bamboo Valley, its unique digital ecosystem, adds real value to the token. Investors are getting more than just a meme - they’re backing a movement that’s gaining serious traction across multiple markets. With less than 16 days to go, now is the perfect time to get involved before the next major surge. Dogecoin Faces Retracement as Market Conditions Shift Dogecoin is facing a notable back-pedal in its price as recent market shifts signal a reversal from earlier gains. DOGE had rallied impressively after a period of recovery, but data now shows a steady decline over the past week. Increased selling pressure from both retail investors and whales is driving the retracement. Trading volume, which spiked during the rally, has now dropped significantly as sellers take control. Large accounts have offloaded substantial amounts of DOGE, adding to the downward pressure. DOGE’s recovery momentum has stalled and the token is now retreating from its earlier highs. Some experts have pointed out that the current Dogecoin price decline could continue if broader market conditions worsen or if regulatory uncertainties intensify. With support levels now under stress, DOGE might test lower price zones, potentially nearing key thresholds around $0.18. Conclusion As Dogecoin holders seek higher returns, many are turning to Panshibi for its breakout potential. With current projections, Panshibi could cross $1 faster than Dogecoin. At just $0.005 each, potential investors can enjoy a 20% bonus on their first SHIBI purchase. Don’t miss your chance to be part of the next bullish meme coin!

Data from aggr.trade indicates that XRP’s spot cumulative volume delta (CVD) dropped by 50% in March. A negative CVD means that there is more selling volume than buying. The current CVD value is -$408 million, which signals waning demand, with sellers taking control. Likewise, futures traders are also turning bearish, with perpetual CVD dropping to -1.18 billion on March 11.

Ki-Young Ju, CryptoQuant founder, observed that this uptick aligned with an ongoing distribution phase for XRP. Distribution refers to a period in the market cycle when large investors slowly offload their positions to secure gains, usually happening close to the peak of an upward trend. Related: Why is the XRP price down today? Current data reveals that the distribution phase has intensified over the past seven days. Specifically, whale outflows, measured as a 30-day moving average, have steadily risen. This increase suggests that large holders continued to offload their XRP positions, further driving the distribution trend. XRP total whale flows.

Although the Bitcoin price fell more than 14% last week following U.S. President Donald Trump's executive order on March 7, analysts say declines are normal and healthy in a bull market. Analysts consider this a “macro correction” within the ongoing bull market and state that the correction could go up to $70,000. Nansen analyst Aurelie Barthere said the next key support level was $71,000-$72,000, as broader market concerns, including tariff uncertainties and recession fears, weighed on investors. Barthere noted that Bitcoin and most altcoins have broken important support levels, making it difficult to predict the next significant price levels, saying: “This is a macro correction that is happening. So we should not worry. The next level will be $71,000-$72,000, which is the top of the pre-election trading range. We are still in a bull market, just currently in a correction. “Stocks and cryptocurrencies are pricing in a period of tariff uncertainty and fiscal cuts without the Fed's bullish contribution. Recession fears are emerging and a correction is underway.” Nexo analyst Iliya Kalchev also argued that BTC could fall below $70,000 but could form a stronger foundation for a future rally. Finally, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes also stated that Bitcoin will bottom at $ 70,000 and said, “Be patient. BTC will probably bottom around $ 70,000. A 36% correction from the $ 110,000 ATH is very normal for a bull market.” *This is not investment advice.

After the meme coin plummeted by 60% since the middle of January, pundits are now predicting a massive upswing of up to 500%. The Dogecoin price bottomed out at $0.165, and some now say the token can rocket up to $0.80, even a cool $1.00, between March and April. This is a great opportunity to buy if true, but meme coins are nothing if not unpredictable. A safer investment could be the Rollblock presale, which has already gained over $11 million in liquidity. Rollblock (RBLK): Crypto presale to outpace market recovery Crypto presales are always great ways to ensure wealth. This is when the developer makes tokens available directly at a set price and is not traded on the open market. Traditionally, these tokens have returned spectacular results. For example, BNB was available at $0.50 during its crypto presale. When the markets are in turmoil, as they are presently, finding a crypto presale is like finding a harbour in a storm. This is where Rollblock comes in. Rollblock is having a crypto presale for its RBLK token, a utility token of their new online casino. Online gaming is a massive industry worth over $500 billion annually, and now, thanks to Rollblock’s cutting-edge revolution, it looks ready to set this industry free to fly! The blockchain was made for developments such as Rollblock, and it can now boast as the world’s first-ever play-to-earn online casino built on Ethereum. Getting in on the Rollblock crypto presale is the ideal opportunity to invest in this massive market segment. Where it gets even better is that Rollblock pays out a weekly dividend to all its token holders, making Rollblock not just a crypto investment but an income-generating asset. So much so, this new crypto is even getting traction on x.com and YouTube ! Source: YouTube Dogecoin (DOGE): Dogecoin price prediction stuns embattled markets It was only six weeks ago when the Dogecoin price was above $0.40. On Monday, it had fallen to under $0.17. The Dogecoin price came in for a lot of flak, but it is not alone in that regard. The markets overall have seen a considerable decline on worse-than-expected Asian economic data, tariff fears, and disillusionment with Trump’s crypto reserve. Where Dogecoin is alone, however, is its predicted recovery. Coincodex sees the token hit $0.80 by the middle of April, and some analysts have placed Dogecoin at a 500% pump by the end of March. Source: Coincodex Could there be any truth to this rumour? It would be hard to argue against it. The first is that the news is already in; no more surprises are waiting, and the tide has reached its ebb and is now returning. The second is to never bet against Elon Musk. Love him or hate him, Musk always comes out on top, and as Long as Musk is the cheerleader behind Dogecoin, there is hope the Dogecoin price will do amazing things. All in all, this is probably the lowest the meme coin will ever be, and the Dogecoin price is ripe for ‘buy the dip’ action. Even so, the Dogecoin price prediction may pale compared to the profits to be had in the Rollblock crypto presale. Conclusion The markets have taken a massive knock, but there’s no need for panic. A corner has been turned, and the markets are on the way up. In terms of large-cap tokens, the Dogecoin price prediction leads the pack in recovery figures of up to 500%. However, real profits are to be found in crypto presales, and the Rollblock crypto presale is the one to beat. Rollblock is now available at $0.061 directly from their website.

This development is significant as the bill, if passed, would provide further legitimacy for the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve which US President Donald Trump created with an Executive Order last week. Senator Lummis To Reintroduce Bitcoin Act Bill In an X post , Senator Lummis revealed that she will reintroduce the Bitcoin Act bill in the US Congress today. She noted that this “landmark legislation” will codify President Trump’s bold vision to establish the US Strategic Reserve and strengthen the nation’s economic foundation for future generations. As CoinGape reported last week, Donald Trump signed an Executive Order to create the much-anticipated Bitcoin Reserve. The US plans to use its Bitcoin from seizures to make up this reserve. Senator Lummis’ bill, if passed, will provide a major boost for the reserve as it will mandate the US to purchase up to 1 million BTC. In her post, the Congresswoman stated that Bitcoin is not simply a technological opportunity but a national imperative for America’s continued financial leadership in the 21st century. By transforming Trump’s Executive Order into law, Lummis stated that the US Congress can ensure that the nation will harness the full potential of digital innovation to address its national debt while maintaining a competitive edge in the global economy.

According to an announcement on Mar. 11, the Germany-based post-trade powerhouse will as from April 2025 offer Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) custody services. The move continues Deutsche Börse’s foray into the digital assets market. With this offer, the company is eyeing traction for institutional-grade security of digital assets. Why does it matter?

One of the positions had a liquidation price of $1,928, this was triggered alongside a market plunge during U.S. trading hours. The ETH was less than two minutes away from being liquidated and sold at a MakerDAO auction until the wallet owner deposited 2,000 ETH from Bitfinex as additional collateral. It also paid back $1.5 million worth of the DAI stablecoin. The wallet in question took some by surprise by saving the position as they had previously been inactive since November. That particular position is not out of the woods yet; it will be liquidated if ETH drops to $1,781 or until the owner adds more collateral. Ether is currently trading at $1,928 having bounced from Monday's low of $1,788. Another wallet, which according to X account Lookonchain is suspected of being the Ethereum Foundation, deposited 30,098 ETH ($56.08M) to lower the liquidation price of its position to $1,127. Whilst hundreds of millions of dollars worth of liquidations are fairly common across derivatives markets, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols like MakerDAO use only spot assets. This means that when a liquidation takes place, DeFi liquidity is unable to cope with the skew of spot asset supply. This doesn't occur on derivative exchanges as there is typically more volume and liquidity driven by leverage. In this case, just one of nine-figure liquidation on MarkerDAO would likely send the ETH price tumbling, liquidated the other vulnerable position in its path.

Ozak AI enables better decision-making through its decentralized platform which uses predictive AI models for risk management and financial analytics together in an AI-powered system. The continuous $OZ token presale has become an attractive proposition for investors because they can purchase tokens at $0.003 each during this phase. The presale phase gathered substantial investor interest as it increased the token value from $0.001 toward its present phase pricing. Experts predict that following its official release at $0.05 the $OZ token will experience more appreciation up to $1 within five years, according to market predictions. Market participants view the presale as a concentrated event since its anticipated growth gives investors large potential gains. Evaluating PI Coin’s Market Presence and Its Potential Role in Ozak AI Investments Since its mainnet release, Pi Coin has gained extensive market recognition among the cryptocurrency community. The Pi Network started as a speculative venture and then transitioned to support mobile-based mining, which now operates as an actively traded protocol. Pi Coin achieved the ranking of the top 15 cryptocurrencies according to market monitoring platforms CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko in March 2025. Pi Coin's market rise places it above similar established blockchain projects which demonstrates satisfactory community growth alongside heightened trust from investors. Some investors now consider exchanging their Pi Coin assets into early stage innovations such as the $OZ token presale because of its strengthened position in the marketplace. Pi Coin holders who decide to invest their assets in the $OZ token presale can maximize their opportunities because the tokens are available for $0.003 each. Projected Returns for PI Coin Holders Investing in Ozak AI Investors who want to convert their Pi Coin assets into $OZ tokens during the presale phase will have the chance to see strong potential gains. At its current exchange value of $1.3 per Pi Coin, investors can expect the following investment results. 50 PI Coins ($65): 21,667 $OZ tokens 500 PI Coins ($650): 216,667 $OZ tokens 1,000 PI Coins ($1,300): 433,333 $OZ tokens Should the $OZ token reach the projected value of $1, these investments would translate into the following potential returns: 21,667 $OZ tokens: $21,667 216,667 $OZ tokens: $216,667 433,333 $OZ tokens: $433,333 The initial stages of the Ozak AI ecosystem business provide investors with potential financial gains that can be calculated from these numbers. The $OZ token presents itself as a marketable blockchain asset because financial establishments need AI analytics solutions, which allows it to become an attractive blockchain property. Future Implications and Market Considerations The $OZ token price projection forecasts remain uncertain because AI-enhanced financial solutions continue to attract expanding market demand. As Ozak AI distributes its operations while implementing predictive AI capabilities, market observers see promising prospects for the company. The value growth of the $OZ token will rely on a balance between general market dynamics and Artificial Intelligence diffusion rates alongside broader crypto market movement trends. Strategic conversions into $OZ benefit from the maintained top position of Pi Coin alongside increased trading liquidity of digital currencies. Investors must stay updated on cryptocurrency market regulations together with technological advancements and general market sentiments because these areas will drive its progress. The innovative approach combined with decentralized financial solutions at Ozak AI operates as an essential component for driving its future triumph, which may position the company firmly within the AI-blockchain industry. Investors eagerly participating in the presale purchase of $OZ at $0.003 can establish early investments that may result in exceptional profit potential. Market changes will rely on AI-driven solutions together with blockchain technology to establish the future structure of decentralized financial systems.

He hates crypto",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/william-banks-rugged-50k-for-palestine-hates-crypto/,"Cryptopolitan had the chance to sit down for a virtual chat with 27-year-old William Banks, the performance artist/comedian, who rug pulled $50,000 from a meme coin he created and donated everything to Palestine, right after breaking out of prison, which he was in because he pulled out a couple of pro-Israel signs off some folks’ yards in Westport, Connecticut. William Banks posts evidence of donations to Palestinian charities What we first learned from William was that he actually hates crypto, though he admitted that he orchestrated the rug pull intentionally, but it was mostly out of spite. Why William hates crypto According to William, after he went viral for posting a video of himself and his “fugitive” buddies breaking out of prison on February 20 with over 20 million views, many crypto influencers reached out to ask him to launch a meme coin , and some even created tokens inspired by him and kept sending him huge parts of the supply. But, “I don’t like those guys,” William told me during our chat. “They were using me, so I decided to use them back.” One of the influencers William spoke about is Jester, a pseudonymous self-proclaimed “meme coin advertiser,” who William said was absolutely horrible to him. William Banks poses for a photo. Source: Instagram “I am never doing anything in crypto again,” William said. He explained that he believes crypto and the people in it are actually “a danger” to the world. “Crypto is negative. It’s just bad.” “Can it really be all that negative when it easily helped you donate a healthy sum to such a great cause?” I asked him. “Well it’s not all bad of course,” William replied. “Some people in it are good, but most of them are just Elon Musk wannabes, they’re just incels who could care less about the state of the world. I just wanted to be Robin Hood.” William Banks’ jailbreak isn’t actually real It’s hard to argue with that, so we decided to pivot by asking him: “So the big question; Is all of it real? Did you really go to prison and break out of it?” “It’s real,” he said, straightforwardly. “I recreated it of course, but it’s real. It happened.” I brought up the fact that Westport Administrative Lieutenant Eric Woods has already debunked the jailbreak story, and William vaguely explained that there is something bigger at play here, though Cryptopolitan is quite convinced he’s just having a bit of fun, pulling off a prank. William has a “friend” named Ant who he apparently was in prison with. They were cellmates and they broke out of the prison together. Ant has been featured in many of William’s documented videos on X and Instagram , and was calling William “White Moses” during the stunt escape. William Banks with “prison buddy” Ant That’s where the inspiration for William’s meme coin came from. He called it White Moses (MOSES). But after their stunt, William told us that he and Ant had a fallout after he took credit for planning the escape. Apparently, Ant was the mastermind, so that led to the former being kidnapped and supposedly even extorted. “But I still wanna be his friend,” said William. William also has a girlfriend, Maddie, who he hangs out with while “on the run,” chilling in motels, dancing, smoking, eating, and singing together. Before our interview, Maddie’s posts on X had hinted at a potential breakup, but when we asked William about it, he said, “No, we’re still together. We’re together right now.” William Banks with girlfriend Maddie. Source: William Banks (X/Twitter) “I cannot really say much about the whole situation, there are people with me who are protecting me who wouldn’t let anything happen to me. Something big is behind me,” he told us. Towards the end of our chat, William shared that he dreams of being a well-versed traveler one day. He wants to go to Africa and even Asia. And he is strictly anti-Zionism and anti-Israel. “But no, I’m never doing crypto again,” he concluded. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Analyzing Shiba Inu, Remittix and Floki Inu",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/which-of-these-3-cryptos-can-turn-500-into-250000-in-2025-analyzing-shiba-inu-remittix-and-floki-inu,"Turning $500 into $250,000 in crypto isn’t impossible. However, choosing the right asset is key. Shiba Inu (SHIB), Floki Inu (FLOKI), and Remittix (RTX) are three contenders, each with unique potential. While SHIB and FLOKI rely on meme coin hype, Remittix is revolutionizing payments with real-world utility. Its PayFi system is already attracting serious investors, positioning it as a breakout star. Which of these three has the best shot at delivering life-changing gains in 2025? Shiba Inu Investors Question Its Growth Potential in 2025 Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen wild price swings in the past, but lately, it has struggled to recapture its former glory. The popular meme coin slipped 10% in the last 7 days , now trading at $0.00001238. With supply pressures and lingering technical issues, Shiba Inu’s road to significant gains appears uncertain. While its loyal fan base remains strong, many investors are questioning whether SHIB can still deliver life-changing returns or if better opportunities lie elsewhere. Market analysts predict a further drop of 1.72%, potentially pushing Shiba Inu price down to $0.00001265 by April 7. While price fluctuations are nothing new for meme coins, SHIB’s inability to break out has some traders looking at alternatives. The crypto space is evolving, and assets with real-world utility are gaining momentum. Some believe that newer projects, particularly those in the payments sector, could outperform Shiba Inu price in the next bull cycle. Remittix Positions Itself as a Leader in the $190 Trillion Payments Market While meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Floki Inu (FLOKI) rely on community hype, Remittix (RTX) is proving to be a serious contender with real-world utility. Targeting the massive $190 trillion cross-border payments market, Remittix offers instant crypto-to-fiat swaps with no hidden fees. Instead of chasing speculative pumps, investors are seeing it as a long-term solution that could deliver exponential gains—potentially turning $500 into a life-changing fortune by 2025. The presale alone has been a massive success, raising $13.8 million and selling over 517 million tokens at $0.0734. Early buyers have already pocketed 1000% returns, even as the broader market faced turbulence. Analysts point to Remittix’s strong fundamentals, highlighting its secure public ledger system and resistance to manipulation—key factors that separate it from meme-based assets. Beyond speculation, Remittix is solving real financial problems. Its Pay API also enables businesses to accept crypto payments while settling in fiat effortlessly. With a balance of hype and functionality, Remittix is being hailed as a DeFi trailblazer. If presale momentum carries into its launch, a 200% surge could be just the beginning. Floki Inu Struggles to Maintain Support Amid Bearish Price Action Floki Inu (FLOKI) is at a crossroads. Sell pressure is mounting, and key support levels are weakening. The token currently hovers around $0.00006195 , more than 80% below its all-time high. This has left investors questioning whether it still holds 100x potential. Trading volume is thinning out, and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains stuck below 40, signaling persistent weakness. While some traders are eyeing a possible bounce, the lack of strong buy walls suggests any relief rally may be short-lived. On-chain data paints a concerning picture. Whales have been offloading their holdings, with net exchange inflows rising 3.2%—a clear sign that major players are cashing out. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) remains in negative territory, andwidening Bollinger Bands indicate increased volatility. If Floki Inu fails to hold its current support, analysts warn that another sharp drop could be on the horizon. Despite the uncertainty, Floki Inu remains a top pick among meme coin traders hoping for a comeback. However, in a market shifting toward utility-driven assets, investors are looking elsewhere. Remittix (RTX) is gaining traction, offering a real-world financial solution through its PayFi system. Remittix Delivers Real-World Use as Traders Look for the Next 200x Crypto As more people recognize the value of utility-focused projects, Remittix is positioning itself as a leader in the DeFi space. If its presale momentum translates into continued adoption, Remittix could deliver 200% gains in a month. For investors tired of meme coin volatility, Remittix offers a solid, real-world use case with massive growth potential. With increasing institutional interest, it could be the crypto that turns a $500 investment into a small fortune by 2025.

This brutal sell-off is due to Bitcoin’s (BTC) sudden collapse below $80,000 over the weekend. The upcoming blood moon lunar eclipse could be a silver lining that catalyzes a bullish reversal or it could further exacerbate the downtrend by another leg of correction not just for Ethereum price but also the entire crypto market. How Will Ethereum Price React to the Upcoming Blood Moon Lunar Eclipse? A Lunar Eclipse known as the ‘Blood Moon’ is set to occur on the night of March 13, 14 2025, which has caused many crypto investors to expect heightened volatility, similar to the past three days. Lunar cycles tend to affect stock market returns. For example, research shows that stock returns are lower on the days around a full moon than on the days around a new moon. For Bitcoin, full moons signal a bullish reversal. Popular analyst Crypto Damus noted “eclipses can create extreme emotions” and “extreme sentiment” especially with “an opposition to fear planet Saturn.” When such eclipses are combined with “venus retor,” Damus adds, “You get a perfect storm for a Panic Sell Off.” So, investors can expect heightened volatility, but a further crash in crypto markets is highly unlikely, especially if Bitcoin (BTC) stabilizes between $78K and $82K. In such a case, the blood moon lunar eclipse could catalyze a bullish reversal. Ethereum Price Analysis: Will ETH Crash or Reverse? From a technical standpoint, Ethereum price has swept the previous daily lows and created a bullish swing failure pattern (SFP). This is the first bullish signal. Due to the SFP, ETH has bounced 10% and currently trades at $1,900 with more upside potential, according to data from TradingView . However, if Bitcoin remains weak and ETH price fails to overcome the $2,100 to $2,200 resistance zone, it will signal weakness. In such a case, the blood moon lunar eclipse could further exacerbate the bearish trend and catalyze a panic sell-off to $1,500 or $1,000. ETH/USDT 1-day chart On the other hand, if Ethereum price recovers above $2,200, it will set up a higher high and confirm a shift in market structure favoring bulls. In such a case, ETH needs to create a higher low, potentially above $2,000, to retain this optimistic structure. Such a bullish Ethereum price prediction could trigger another leg up to $2,500 or even the $3,000 psychological level. Conclusion The upcoming Blood Moon Lunar Eclipse adds uncertainty to Ethereum’s price outlook, but technical analysis suggests that a bullish reversal is possible if Ethereum can overcome key resistance levels and Bitcoin stabilizes.

In the US, the Senate Banking Committee is preparing to vote on a revised stablecoin regulation bill that could establish clearer oversight for issuers like Tether and Circle. Meanwhile, European finance officials are voicing concerns over President Donald Trump’s favorable stance on digital assets, warning that an increase in dollar-backed stablecoins could threaten the euro’s monetary sovereignty. As regulatory frameworks evolve on both sides of the Atlantic, the future of stablecoins and digital currencies remains a key area of debate. EU Finance Officials Sound Alarm Over Trump’s Crypto Embrace and Its Impact on Monetary Sovereignty Senior finance officials within the European Union (EU) have raised concerns about US President Donald Trump’s favorable stance toward digital assets. The growing affinity of the US administration towards cryptocurrencies—particularly dollar-backed stablecoins—has sparked fears that Europe’s monetary sovereignty and financial stability could be at risk. During a Eurogroup press conference on March 10, European Stability Mechanism (ESM) Managing Director Pierre Gramegna expressed his concerns, emphasizing that Washington’s evolving crypto policies could reignite major foreign and US tech companies’ ambitions to develop mass payment solutions based on stablecoins denominated in US dollars. “The US administration is favorable toward cryptocurrencies and especially dollar-denominated stablecoins, which may raise certain concerns in Europe,” Gramegna stated. “And if this were to be successful, it could affect the euro area’s monetary sovereignty and financial stability.” The ESM, an intergovernmental institution designed to help maintain financial stability within the euro area, has voiced strong support for accelerating the development of a European central bank digital currency (CBDC), known as the digital euro. According to Gramegna, the urgency behind launching the digital euro is greater than ever, with European authorities needing to safeguard the continent’s financial independence in the face of America’s shifting stance on cryptocurrencies. “The ESM supports the ECB’s urgency in making the digital euro a reality to safeguard Europe’s strategic autonomy—this digital euro is today more necessary than ever,” Gramegna emphasized. His remarks were echoed by Irish Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe, who highlighted the broader implications of US policy shifts on Europe’s economic landscape. “Policy developments in other jurisdictions can have important consequences for us here in Europe,” Donohoe noted. He stressed that discussions surrounding the digital euro are not just a matter of innovation but are “fundamentally linked to our own autonomy and to the resilience of our currency.” The European Central Bank (ECB) has been actively working on developing a CBDC since 2020, exploring both consumer-facing retail digital euro models and wholesale cross-border settlements between financial institutions. In February, the ECB announced an expansion of its CBDC payment system to facilitate institutional transactions. This move aligns with the ECB’s broader strategy to maintain financial sovereignty and reduce reliance on non-European digital payment systems. ECB President Christine Lagarde has consistently maintained a skeptical stance on integrating cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin into the European financial system. In a statement made in late January, Lagarde reiterated that central banks must prioritize assets that are “liquid, secure, and safe,” making it unlikely that Bitcoin or other volatile digital assets will be incorporated into European monetary reserves. Trump’s Diverging Approach to Digital Assets While the EU pushes for a state-controlled digital currency, the US approach under Donald Trump’s influence appears to be taking a different trajectory. In January, Trump signed an executive order prohibiting the establishment, issuance, and circulation of a Federal Reserve-backed CBDC. Instead, the administration formed a crypto working group to explore alternative policies that prioritize private sector innovation in digital assets. Trump’s resistance to a state-controlled digital dollar stands in contrast to the Biden administration’s previous exploratory efforts regarding a US CBDC. His stance aligns more closely with pro-crypto factions advocating for decentralized financial solutions rather than government-issued digital money. The divergence in US and EU approaches to digital currencies shows a widening transatlantic rift in financial policy. While Europe views a digital euro as essential for economic sovereignty, the US, under Trump’s influence, appears to favor a more laissez-faire approach that encourages private sector dominance in the crypto space. European policymakers are concerned that an influx of dollar-backed stablecoins in the region could diminish the role of the euro in global trade and financial transactions. With major US firms potentially launching mass-market stablecoin payment solutions, European economies could find themselves increasingly dependent on American-controlled financial infrastructure—a scenario EU officials want to avoid. As the ECB continues to refine its digital euro project and the US administration shapes its approach to cryptocurrency regulation , the global financial order may be poised for significant changes. Whether these diverging policies will lead to economic conflict or a redefined digital currency ecosystem remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: the geopolitical battle over financial sovereignty in the digital age has only just begun. US Senate Banking Committee to Vote on Updated Stablecoin Regulation Bill In related news, the US Senate Banking Committee is set to vote on a revised Republican-led stablecoin framework bill, known as the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, on March 13. The bill, originally introduced by Senator Bill Hagerty in early February, has undergone significant updates following bipartisan consultations, incorporating changes that address consumer protections, risk mitigation, regulatory pathways, and transparency requirements. Senator Hagerty, one of the bill’s key sponsors, confirmed on March 10 that the updated version of the GENIUS Act would be put to a vote in the Senate Banking Committee. The bill enjoys bipartisan support, with Republican Senators Cynthia Lummis and Tim Scott (the committee chair) co-sponsoring alongside Democratic Senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Angela Alsobrooks. “The updated version of the GENIUS Act makes significant improvements to a number of important provisions, including consumer protections, authorized stablecoin issuers, risk mitigation, state pathways, insolvency, transparency, and more,” said Senator Gillibrand in a statement. The bill aims to bring US dollar stablecoin issuers with market caps exceeding $10 billion—currently limited to Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC—under the regulatory oversight of the Federal Reserve. Smaller issuers with market caps below this threshold would have the option to comply with state-level regulations. The updated version of the GENIUS Act introduces stricter requirements for foreign stablecoin issuers, potentially giving US-issued stablecoins a competitive advantage. Dom Kwok, co-founder of Web3 learning app EasyA, noted on X that the bill’s latest provisions impose “extra high standards” on foreign issuers, particularly in reserve and liquidity requirements, anti-money laundering (AML) checks, and sanctions compliance. “Most foreign issuers will find these standards hard to meet,” Kwok said, suggesting that these requirements position US-based stablecoins, such as Circle’s USDC and Ripple Labs’ Ripple USD (RLUSD), favorably in the market. Prominent crypto attorney Jeremy Hogan of Hogan & Hogan echoed similar sentiments, arguing that the bill’s stipulations on reserves and AML compliance “all fall neatly for RLUSD and USDC.” Regulatory Challenges Ahead While the GENIUS Act is making progress, it still faces multiple legislative hurdles before becoming law. If the Senate Banking Committee approves the bill on March 13, it will then be presented for a full Senate vote, where it could be subject to further debate and amendments. Should the Senate pass the bill, it will then proceed to the House of Representatives. If the House makes no modifications, the bill will be sent to President Donald Trump for final approval. However, if the House alters any provisions, the bill would require reconciliation before reaching the president’s desk, where he could either sign it into law or veto it. The GENIUS Act is one of the most comprehensive efforts to regulate stablecoins in the United States. Its passage could redefine the landscape for digital asset-backed currencies, particularly by establishing clear compliance pathways for major issuers. The bill’s impact extends beyond the US market. With foreign issuers facing higher regulatory scrutiny, non-US stablecoin providers may struggle to meet the stringent reserve and AML requirements. This could, in turn, solidify the dominance of American stablecoins in global markets, particularly USDC and RLUSD, both of which align closely with the bill’s regulatory framework. As the Senate Banking Committee prepares to vote, all eyes will be on how lawmakers balance regulatory oversight with the need to foster innovation in the fast-evolving digital finance sector. If the GENIUS Act advances successfully, it will mark a significant step in defining the role of stablecoins in the US financial ecosystem.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|FIAT|MARKET|USDC|USDT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-11 14:00:00

Though US President Donald Trump’s crypto policies pose a significant threat to Europe’s monetary autonomy, the continent leads in terms of crypto-friendly banks. Patrick Hansen, an executive at Circle, recently shared his thoughts on X, highlighting Europe’s strong grip on the crypto banking sector. Let’s dive into his key insights and understand Europe’s role in digital asset banks despite the US’ crypto threat. Europe Leads in Crypto Banking, Says Patrick Hansen In a recent X post , Patrick Hansen, the Director, EU Strategy and Policy Advisor at Circle, posited, “Europe is leading the world in terms of crypto-friendly banks.” As global powers like the United States strive to establish a strong foothold in the crypto industry through banking relationships, Europe has quietly secured its position as the undisputed leader in the sector. According to Hansen, while the US has merely begun exploring crypto banking, Europe has already made significant strides, boasting over 50 banks that offer digital asset services. He wrote on X, 50+ European banks now offer crypto services, including trading, custody, staking, payments, stablecoins, and banking services for crypto firms. Europe is home to the largest number of crypto-friendly banks in the world—by far. Further, Hansen added that European banks, including top-tier G-SIBs, have laid the groundwork for crypto growth through years of infrastructure development, expertise building, and regulatory compliance, with MiCA now providing a clear path forward. Trump’s Policies Challenge Europe’s Monetary Autonomy A European Union official recently expressed concerns that US President Donald Trump’s crypto policies could compromise Europe’s control over its own monetary system. This statement was made during a press conference following a Eurogroup meeting on Monday. Despite this, the Europe crypto banking sector stands firm amid the growing competition. “The US administration is favorable towards cryptocurrencies and especially dollar-denominated stablecoins, which may raise certain concerns in Europe,” stated European Stability Mechanism’s Managing Director Pierre Gramegna at the conference. Gramegna warned that US support for USD stablecoins may enable tech giants to develop ubiquitous payment solutions, threatening Europe’s monetary independence and financial stability. This comes following EU crypto exchange KuCoin’s application for a Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCAR) license in Austria. Europe Crypto Banking Ahead of OCC’s Custody Rule In a recent development, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) allowed US banks to custody cryptocurrencies and engage in stablecoin activities. This development has generated excitement within the community, fueling hopes for expanded banking services and greater mainstream adoption. Reflecting on this development, Hansen stated, “While the U.S. OCC just issued guidance allowing banks to engage in digital asset services such as custody or stablecoin services, European banks are already years ahead.” He added that European banks are poised to capitalize on their first-mover advantage, a rare instance of the region leading the pack.

41483010,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=710104,1741701623,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,XRP Flirts With A Daily Range Breakdown – Price Must Hold Above $2 Level,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ripple/xrp-flirts-with-a-daily-range-breakdown-price-must-hold-above-2-level/,"XRP has fallen below the $2 mark for the first time since early February, following the broader market breakdown that has pushed most cryptocurrencies lower. Despite the intense selling pressure, XRP has held up stronger than many other altcoins, avoiding the steep declines seen across the market. However, uncertainty remains high, with analysts divided on XRP’s next move. Related Reading: Charts Reveal Cardano Holds Key Support Zone – Staying Above Could ‘Set The Next Move’ Some experts believe that if XRP can reclaim key resistance levels, it could trigger a recovery rally, bringing back bullish momentum. On the other hand, bearish analysts warn of further downside, arguing that XRP’s failure to hold above support levels could lead to a deeper correction. Top analyst BigCheds shared a technical analysis on X, suggesting that XRP is on the verge of breaking down below the $1.90 mark. If this happens, XRP could see increased selling pressure, leading to a larger drop in price. With price at a pivotal level, traders are watching whether it can stabilize and recover or if further losses are on the horizon. The coming days will be crucial in determining XRP’s short-term trend as market volatility remains high. Crypto and Stock Markets Struggle Amid Uncertainty The entire crypto market has been struggling as negative macroeconomic conditions continue to weigh on investor sentiment. U.S. President Trump’s policies and global trade war tensions have created an environment of volatility and uncertainty, making it difficult for markets to stabilize. As a result, the U.S. stock market has plunged to its lowest levels since September 2024, adding to the overall risk-off sentiment across all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Rally Above ATH To $128K – On-Chain Indicator Signals Potential Recovery With fear and uncertainty rising, analysts are calling for a continuation of the downtrend across both traditional markets and digital assets. Investors remain hesitant to enter long positions, and many are waiting for clearer signals before making any moves. XRP, despite holding up better than some altcoins, is not immune to the broader market turmoil. BigChed’s technical insights on X warn that XRP is flirting with a range breakdown on the daily chart. According to his analysis, if XRP loses the $2–$1.90 support level, it could trigger a significant drop, opening the door for further downside pressure. As XRP hovers near this critical level, traders are closely monitoring whether bulls can defend key support or if the market-wide downturn will push prices even lower. With macroeconomic concerns and heightened volatility dominating the landscape, the coming days will be pivotal in determining XRP’s short-term trajectory. XRP Holds $2 Amid Heavy Selling Pressure XRP is currently trading at $2.13 after experiencing massive selling pressure over the past few days. Earlier, the price briefly dropped to $1.89, testing a critical support level before bouncing back above the $2 mark. Despite the short-term recovery, XRP remains under bearish control, and bulls must hold firm above $2 to prevent further downside. For XRP to regain momentum, buyers need to push prices toward key resistance zones around $2.30–$2.50. A strong move above these levels could confirm a recovery, helping XRP avoid a larger market-wide sell-off. However, failing to defend the $2 support would put XRP at risk of a deeper correction, with the next major demand zone sitting around $1.60.

Bulls must step in soon to reclaim higher levels, or the risk of further losses will continue to grow.

His thesis comes as the SOL price remains in a bear market after falling by almost 60% from its highest level this year. Solana Price Could Surge to $4,000 SOL price has been in a strong downward trend after peaking at $295 earlier as its meme coins were soaring. Recently, it has not been left behind in the ongoing crypto sell-off as it has crashed to $125. This drop has led to a $64 billion wipeout as its market cap has slipped from $124 billion to $63 billion. One crypto analyst has identified a similarity between Solana’s price action in late 2020 and early 2021. At the time, the coin slipped from around $2.5 in November and bottomed at $1.1 in December. It then staged a strong comeback to over $56 by May 2021 as most crypto prices surged. Solana Price Forecast Solana price has had a similar performance this year as it plunged from $295 in January to near $100 today. After bottoming during the ongoing shakeout, the analyst expects the coin to almost double from here and get to $200, and then go parabolic to $4,000 by August this year. Such a move would imply a 3,100% surge from the current level. Solana has a market cap of over $63 billion, meaning that a surge to $4,000 would give it a market cap of over $2.38 trillion. While these parabolic moves are possible in the crypto industry, there are chances that his SOL price forecast is highly optimistic. SOL Price Technical Analysis: Key Support Needs to Hold The weekly chart shows that the Solana price has been in a steep downward trend after peaking at $294.75 in January to about $120. It has retreated below the key support at $169.05, the neckline of the double-top pattern , one of the most popular bearish signs in the market. One positive for Solana is that it has crashed to a crucial support where it has failed to move below at least five times since 2024. This price also coincides with the 61.8% Fibonacci Retracement level or the golden ratio, where rebounds tend to happen. On top of this, Solana price has become oversold as the Stochastic RSI has moved to 3.60. The last time it dropped to this level was in September last year, and the coin bounced back afterward. Solana price chart Therefore, there is a likelihood that the SOL price will bounce back in the coming days, with the next level to watch being at $170, up by about 45% from the current level. A drop below the support at $120 will invalidate the bullish view, and point to further downside, potentially to the 78.6% retracement at $68.

In a March 11 announcement , Cantor Fitzgerald said it is rolling out its Bitcoin ( BTC ) financing business with $2 billion in initial capital to help institutional investors borrow against their crypto holdings. Anchorage Digital and Copper will safeguard clients’ digital assets by acting as custodians and collateral managers, the company said. Source: Anchorage Digital Anchorage Digital is an institutional cryptocurrency platform that operates the only federally chartered digital asset bank in the United States. Copper is a crypto custodian backed by Barclays , the British multinational financial institution. Copper CEO Amar Kuchinad said Cantor Fitzgerald’s new offering will help institutional investors “diversify their portfolios” into digital assets. He cited the “growing demand for sophisticated financing solutions” in the Bitcoin space. Cantor Fitzgerald unveiled plans for its BTC financing business in July of last year “to provide leverage to investors who hold Bitcoin,” the company said at the time. Since then, the company has broadened its exposure to the digital asset market, including acquiring a 5% stake in stablecoin issuer Tether. Cantor Fitzgerald has more than $5 billion in assets under management, based on the latest regulatory filings .

Time to Invest in the Best Wallet Token?,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/the-ecb-pushes-for-digital-euro-good-time-to-invest-in-the-best-wallet-token/,"Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank, said that the ECB is aggressively pursuing the idea of a digital euro and expects to finish the testing phase by October 2025. If it goes through, it will be the EU’s first Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). Unlike cryptocurrencies, CBDCs aren’t decentralized or run on blockchain. They’re pegged to a country’s national currency, so the value of 1 digital euro is equal to the value of one physical euro. CBDCs have been a hot topic of debate for a long time now. Proponents believe they’re absolutely essential to move to a cashless economy. They also argue that they’re a lifeline for unbanked populations, especially in regions where traditional banking infrastructure is limited. Detractors feel they centralize financial power, contradicting the decentralized ethos of cryptocurrencies. Also, historical data from countries that have implemented digital currencies aren’t that encouraging. For instance: 98.5% of Nigeria’s eNaira wallets remain unused In Jamaica, only 0.11% of the total currency in circulation is in the form of digital currency Even cashless economies like Norway say that a retail CBDC is unnecessary So, the real question is, why is Europe pushing for a CBDC? The Hidden CBDC Motives Not to stir up conspiracy here, but it’s a well-known fact that CBDCs give the government more control over people’s finances. They’re often viewed as a threat to the very freedom that’s been a central tenet of cryptocurrencies. Even US President Trump has taken a firm stance against CBDCs, calling them a “dangerous threat to freedom,” and citing concerns about potential government overreach and the risk of financial surveillance. In January 2025, he signed an executive order banning CBDCs in the US. Digital Euro May Result in a Crypto Bull Run Despite all this, the EU is pushing forward with its plans. Whatever the motives behind the creation of the digital euro may be, the crypto market is sure to make its feelings known. Enthusiastic investors might go on to buy crypto aggressively to reinforce their support for the original mechanism. Moreover, with the announcement of a US Bitcoin reserve and several pro-crypto regulatory changes in the pipeline, the time seems ripe for the next crypto boom. And this digital euro announcement might just be the spark needed to set off the explosion. If that happens, everyone is going to need a good crypto wallet, which may just be the investment opportunity of the day. Enter Best Wallet Token ($BEST) . What Is $BEST? $BEST is the native token of the Best Wallet App – a secure, multi-chain, non-custodial crypto wallet that looks set to claim 40% of the crypto wallet market by 2026. Security-wise, too, you can’t go wrong with Best Wallet, which uses Fireblock’s MPC-CMP wallet technology along with multi-factor authentication and biometrics for airtight privacy and security. By holding $BEST tokens and using the Best Wallet App, you benefit from no gas fees plus loads of airdrop rewards. You earn free $BEST tokens by frequently using Best Wallet, completing daily quests, and engaging with Best Wallet socials. Holding the $BEST token comes with a lot of other insider perks. For instance, it’ll unlock the ‘upcoming tokens’ section on the app. Here, you can find all trending meme coin presales well before they go on sale to the general public. This gives you the opportunity to become an early investor in high-potential cryptos. Moreover, each of these coins is vetted by the Best Wallet team, meaning you can rest assured that they’re not scams or random hoax websites. Aside from no gas fees on the platform, holders can also benefit from a high staking reward, currently at 145% p.a. Why Should You Invest in $BEST? The total crypto wallet market is expected to surge to a massive $32B by 2030. As one of the fastest-growing crypto wallets right now, with a 50% month-on-month user base increase, Best Wallet is positioned to profit from this. If it goes on to capture its projected 40% slice of the market, and you’re along for the ride, your wallet could fill up fast. In addition to benefitting from the app’s growth, $BEST token holders will also enjoy regular market updates and access to real-time charts. This way, they’ll stay abreast with what’s happening in the crypto space. Developers also have plans to introduce the Best Card – a crypto debit card that lets you spend your cryptocurrency anywhere. At the pace at which crypto is breaking into the mainstream, it’s easy to see why $BEST could be the next crypto to explode . The $BEST presale has been performing phenomenally well, having raised nearly $11M so far. Currently available at a price of just $0.0243, the next $BEST price increase will take place in less than two days.

Trump’s US Bitcoin Reserve Could Trigger Next Leg Up,https://cryptonews.com/news/btc-price-set-to-explode-trumps-us-bitcoin-reserve-could-trigger-next-leg-up/,"Bitcoin (BTC) has fallen below $80,000, erasing gains since Donald Trump’s election victory. Market uncertainty is mounting as investors react to economic risks, pushing BTC to $76,800—its lowest level since November. In a recent interview, Trump acknowledged a possible U.S. recession , calling it a “period of transition.” While he remains a crypto advocate, macroeconomic concerns are overshadowing sentiment, accelerating Bitcoin’s decline. Crypto and Equity Markets Slide as Outflows Surge Financial markets are struggling, with the Nasdaq down 3% and the S&P 500 losing 1.8%. Crypto stocks took a hit: Coinbase dropped 17.6% Robinhood fell 19.8% MicroStrategy tumbled 16% Bitcoin ETFs have suffered four straight weeks of outflows, with $867 million withdrawn last week alone. Digital asset fund outflows totaled $4.75 billion in the past month, reducing AUM to $142 billion—the lowest since November 2024. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index plunged to 17 (Extreme Fear) as liquidations surged, wiping out $195 million in four hours, primarily from long positions. Inflation concerns ahead of key U.S. economic reports (CPI and PPI) are adding to market jitters. Institutional Demand and Stablecoins Could Fuel Bitcoin’s Comeback Despite the downturn, institutional interest remains strong. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reaffirmed support for stablecoins to maintain U.S. dollar dominance, and Trump has authorized a Bitcoin reserve using seized assets, signaling potential regulatory tailwinds. Tether, the largest stablecoin issuer, now holds $6.8 billion in Bitcoin, boosting market liquidity. Analysts suggest further U.S. government support for stablecoins and Bitcoin could attract institutional investment, setting the stage for BTC’s next rally. Bitcoin Struggles Below $82K – Can Bulls Hold Key Support? Bitcoin is testing resistance at $82,200, trading around $80,600 (-1.3%). It remains under pressure, struggling below the descending trendline and 50-period EMA at $85,000. On the downside, $77,800 is a critical support level—if breached, BTC could drop to $74,600 or even $71,900. However, holding this level and breaking $82,200 could push BTC toward $86,400 in the near term. For now, Bitcoin’s bearish structure remains intact, and traders are watching key levels for signs of a breakout or further downside. BTC Bull: Earn Bitcoin Rewards with the Hottest Crypto Presale BTC Bull ($BTCBULL) is gaining traction as a community-driven token that rewards holders with real Bitcoin. Unlike conventional meme tokens, BTCBULL airdrops BTC automatically when Bitcoin reaches key price milestones, offering a strong incentive for long-term investors. Staking & Passive Income Opportunities BTC Bull features high-yield staking, allowing users to earn passive income with an impressive 154% APY. This staking system has already seen strong community participation, with millions of BTCBULL tokens staked.

41487217,https://coinpedia.org/?p=430731,1741707470,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,Solana Price Prediction: Can SOL Shatter $500 as JetBolt’s Presale Shows Strength,https://coinpedia.org/sponsored/can-sol-shatter-500-as-jetbolts-presale-shows-strength/,"The post Solana Price Prediction: Can SOL Shatter $500 as JetBolt’s Presale Shows Strength appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Solana (SOL) is trading at $120.78 today. This decline is partly attributed to multiple meme coin incidents, such as the LIBRA meme coin scandal, which have negatively impacted Solana. With its inclusion in the new Crypto Strategic Reserve order and the new network layer-2 upgrade quietly in the works, can these help Solana reverse its current bearish trend and shatter $500? In other altcoin news, the new altcoin JetBolt (JBOLT) , is stirring up the crypto waters with its presale selling over 340 million tokens since its debut. JetBolt continues to enthrall the crypto community with its blockchain functionality and innovative solutions. What are the factors that could help Solana reach $500? And what’s behind JetBolt’s presale success? Let’s discover. Solana Price Prediction: Can Solana Hit $500? Solana is currently in a bearish trend, with a 5.3% decline in the last 24 hours and 11.4% over the past week. Due to meme coin scandals, such as the LIBRA meme coin incident, Solana faced some serious capital outflows with over $485 million as some investors flocked to other major blockchain platforms for refuge. SOL experienced a 41.4% price drop in the last thirty days. Solana’s technical indicators suggest it may be approaching a death cross pattern, which happens when the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) crosses below the 200-day SMA. If Solana validates this bearish pattern, SOL’s price will further decline. Solana is testing resistance at $136.14, with key support levels of $109.08 and $88. Chart illustrating Solana (SOL)’s price declining by 41.4% in the last thirty days. (Source: CoinGecko) Some analysts believe that if Solana manages to stay above its key support levels, it could regain momentum and potentially reverse its bearish trend. But for now, Solana needs to regain investors’ confidence and acquire inflows to improve its bearish price. Solana is currently working on a network upgrade called the layer 2 solution Solaxy ($SOLX), which aims to boost network sustainability and enhance the network’s efficiency during traffic. Solana is also one of the coins mentioned in the Crypto Strategic Reserve new order signed last March 6th, which garnered mixed reactions from the crypto community. Can Solana hit $500? Reaching $500 is improbable at the moment for SOL, as the coin is still in a bearish trend. SOL needs to break out from its current bearish pattern, acquire bullish momentum, and amplify network activity. Analysts also suggest a longer timeframe would be more realistic for SOL to achieve this price goal. JetBolt (JBOLT)’s Presale Soars Past 340 Million: What’s Behind this Presale Success? While breaking $500 still remains uncertain for Solana at the moment, the new altcoin JetBolt (JBOLT) is smashing headlines with its presale that has already sold over 340 million tokens. JetBolt is piquing the interest of crypto whales and buyers with its flagship feature of zero-gas technology and other cutting-edge features. But what’s behind JetBolt’s presale success? JetBolt’s zero-gas technology is one of the reasons whales are hooked on this new altcoin. Leveraging the powerful Skale Network, JetBolt completely removes gas fees in all its blockchain transactions across the platform. Developers working on decentralized applications (dApps), blockchain gaming, and other Web3 projects on JetBolt’s platform could create without gas fees. JetBolt’s Web3 integration is also one of its main highlights. JetBolt features a Web3 wallet system that has biometric authentication measures enabling the token holders to log in to their accounts without difficulty. JetBolt offers lightning-fast transactions with near-instant finality, ensuring a seamless user experience. Using an AI-powered utility, JetBolt provides blockchain news, stories, and Web3 content that are all aggregated based on bullish or bearish market sentiment. JetBolt also has a daily newsletter feature to prompt token holders to claim their staking rewards. Through its Proof of Attendance and Worth protocol (PAW), stakers can earn more rewards by staking and connecting with other users on JetBolt’s platform. Early adopters can also get more JBOLT tokens by purchasing these Alpha Box packages on JetBolt’s official website. These treasure chests can grant up to 25% more bonus tokens during its ongoing presale. With its zero-gas tech, Web3 wallet feature, and AI-integration tool, it’s no surprise that JetBolt’s presale has gained notable traction. Summary: Can SOL Shatter $500 as JetBolt’s Presale Shows Strength? Solana shattering $500 seems unlikely at the moment, as the coin is currently experiencing a bearish trend caused by some challenging factors. Despite its bearish momentum, analysts are optimistic that Solana could achieve this price goal in the long term if Solana’s market sentiment improves. Besides Solana’s news, JetBolt (JBOLT) is the new talk of the town, with its presale showing strength, selling over 340 million tokens since its launch. JetBolt offers zero-gas technology, a Web3 wallet system, and an AI-powered tool that quickly gained traction among crypto enthusiasts. As JetBolt’s presale mounts, it’s no surprise that this new altcoin continues to attract interest among whales. Explore more about JetBolt, visit its official website and X page today.

41487286,https://cointelegraph.com/news/thorchain-crossroads-decentralized-collides-illicit-activity,1741707479,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png,THORChain at crossroads: Decentralization clashes with illicit activity,https://cointelegraph.com/news/thorchain-crossroads-decentralized-collides-illicit-activity?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"THORChain has been called a money laundering protocol — a label no decentralized finance (DeFi) project wants unless it’s prepared to have regulators breathing down its neck. Its supporters have fended off the criticism by championing decentralization, while its critics point to recent activities that showed some of the protocol’s centralized tendencies. After exploiting Bybit for $1.4 billion, the North Korean state-backed hackers behind the attack, known as the Lazarus Group, flocked to THORChain, making it their top choice to convert stolen funds from Ether ( ETH ) to Bitcoin ( BTC ). Lazarus finished converting its Ether within just 10 days of the hack. The controversy has triggered internal conflict, governance cracks and developer resignations, exposing a deeper issue and question: Can DeFi remain neutral when criminals exploit it at scale? THORChain is not a mixer THORChain is a decentralized swap protocol, so some say it’s unfair to call it a laundering machine, as the output is traceable. It’s not like a mixer, whose purpose is to conceal cryptocurrency fund trails — though the reasons for using mixers vary between users, with some simply wanting to preserve their privacy and others using them for illicit purposes. Federico Paesano, investigations lead at Crystal Intelligence, argued in a LinkedIn post that it is misleading to state that the North Korean hackers “laundered” the Bybit hack proceeds. “So far, there’s been no concealment, only conversion. The stolen ETH have been swapped for BTC using various providers, but every swap is fully traceable. This isn’t laundering; it’s just asset movement across blockchains.” Tracing funds swapped to Bitcoin is time-consuming, but not impossible. Source: Federico Paesano Hackers also moved funds through Uniswap and OKX DEX, yet THORChain has become the focal point of scrutiny due to the sheer volume of funds that passed through it. In a March 4 X post, Bybit CEO Ben Zhou said that 72% of the stolen funds (361,255 ETH) had flowed through THORChain, far surpassing activity on other DeFi services. Over $1 billion in Ether from the Bybit theft was traced to THORChain. Source: Coldfire/Dune Analytics A truly decentralized platform’s strength lies in its neutrality and censorship-resistance, which are foundational to blockchain’s value proposition, according to Rachel Lin, CEO of decentralized exchange SynFutures. “The line between decentralization and responsibility can evolve with technology,” Lin told Cointelegraph. “While human intervention contradicts decentralization’s ethos, protocol-level innovations could automate safeguards against illicit activity.” Related: From Sony to Bybit: How Lazarus Group became crypto’s supervillain THORChain collected at least $5 million in fees from these transactions , a windfall for a project already struggling with financial instability. This financial benefit has further fueled criticism, with some questioning whether THORChain’s reluctance to intervene was ideological or simply a matter of self-preservation. Source: Yogi (Screenshot cropped by Cointelegraph for visibility) Governance cracks show when decentralization becomes a shield The controversy sparked a dilemma on whether THORChain should act. In an attempt to block the hackers, three validators voted to halt ETH trading, effectively closing off their swapping route. However, four validators quickly voted to overturn the decision. This exposed a contradiction in THORChain’s governance model. The protocol claims to be absolutely decentralized, yet it had previously intervened to pause its lending feature due to insolvency risks (swaps still remained operational). Some crypto community members called out THORChain’s actions as selective decentralization, where governance intervention only occurs when it serves the protocol’s own interests. Source: Dan Dadybayo The backlash was immediate . Pluto, a key THORChain developer, resigned . Another developer, TCB, who identified themselves as one of the three validators who voted to halt Ether trades, hinted at leaving unless governance issues were addressed. Meanwhile, blockchain investigator ZachXBT called out Asgardex, a THORChain-based decentralized exchange, for not returning fees earned from hackers, while other protocols reportedly refunded ill-gotten gains. THORChain founder John-Paul Thorbjornsen responded by claiming that centralized exchanges pocket millions from facilitating illicit transactions unless pressured by authorities. “This pisses me off. Do we get ETH and BTC nodes to give back their transaction fees? What about GETH or BTCCore devs - who write the software, funded by grants/donations?” asked Thorbjornsen. Source: ZachXBT THORChain's growing regulatory risks, as previously demonstrated by privacy tools For now, THORChain has avoided any direct enforcement actions from governments, but history suggests that DeFi protocols facilitating illicit finance may not escape scrutiny forever. Tornado Cash, a well-known crypto mixer, was sanctioned by the US Treasury in 2022 after being used to launder billions of dollars, though it was later overturned by a US court . Similarly, Railgun came under FBI scrutiny in 2023 after North Korean hackers used it to move $60 million in stolen Ether. Related: Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev leaves prison custody Railgun presents a unique case, as it’s marketed as a privacy protocol rather than a mixer or a DEX. But the distinction still draws comparisons to THORChain, given that privacy protocols frequently face criticism for potentially enabling illicit activities. “Critics often claim that privacy-focused projects enable crime, but in reality, protecting financial privacy is a fundamental right and a cornerstone of decentralized innovation,” Chen Feng, head of research at Autonomys and associate professor and research chair in blockchain at the University of British Columbia’s Okanagan Campus, told Cointelegraph. “Technologies like ZK-proofs and trusted execution environments can secure user data without obscuring illicit activity entirely. Through optional transparency measures and robust onchain forensics, suspicious patterns can still be detected. The goal is to strike a balance: empower users with privacy while ensuring the system has built-in safeguards to discourage and trace illicit use.” Lin of SynFutures said continued illicit use of decentralized protocols would “absolutely” lead to drastic measures from authorities. “Governments will likely escalate measures if they perceive decentralized protocols as systemic risks. This could include sanctioning protocol addresses, pressuring infrastructure providers, blacklisting entire networks or going after the builders,” she said. Rising pressure against THORChain THORChain supporters argue it is being unfairly singled out, as hackers have also used other DeFi protocols. But regulators tend to focus on the biggest enablers, and THORChain processed the vast majority of the stolen funds from the Bybit hack. This makes it an easy target for enforcement actions ranging from Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions to developer prosecutions. “When the huge majority of your flows are stolen funds from north korea for the biggest money heist in human history, it will become a national security issue, this isn’t a game anymore,” TCB wrote on X. “The threshold you want to be credibly decentralized you need a network of 1000+ unique validators. There is a reason why @Chainflip fixed this issue on the network level so quickly and all front end are applying censorship.” If regulators decide to crack down, the consequences could be severe. Sanctions on THORChain’s validators, front-end service, and liquidity providers could cripple its ecosystem, while major exchanges might delist RUNE ( RUNE ), cutting off its access to liquidity. There is also the possibility of legal action against developers, as seen in the Tornado Cash case , or pressure to introduce compliance measures like sanctioned address filtering — something that would contradict THORChain’s decentralized ethos and alienate its core user base. THORChain’s entanglement with North Korean hackers has put it at a crossroads. The protocol must decide whether to take action now or risk having regulators step in to make that decision for them. For now, the protocol remains firm in its laissez-faire approach, but history suggests DeFi projects that ignore illicit activity don’t stay untouchable forever.

However, there’s an emerging altcoin priced at just $0.07 that’s catching investors’ attention. With its strong use case and growing momentum, experts believe it could hit $4 in the next 100 days. XRP’s Struggles with Regulatory Challenges and Legal Uncertainty XRP price has been volatile in the last year as it partly depends on the uncertainty brought about by its ongoing struggle with the SEC. The lawsuit, which was launched late in 2020, has cast a long shadow over the future of the asset. Currently priced at $2.10 Even though Ripple has dominated cross-border payments, the SEC lawsuit remains a major obstacle. The ongoing regulatory uncertainty of XRP's legal status continues to make it a high-risk investment for the majority of investors and institutions, especially with the added scrutiny of global regulators on cryptocurrencies. In addition to the pressure from the law, XRP has also been stifled by the reality that it was left out of the U.S. government's new Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Investors were looking for XRP to find its way into official government channels as a means of spurring increased use of blockchain technology in payments. The removal of XRP from the reserve put additional pressure on the cryptocurrency, and now it is making it harder for it to achieve significant gains in the short to medium term. Dogecoin: The Meme Coin Struggling for Relevance The path taken by Dogecoin from meme coin to among the most valuable cryptocurrencies has been fascinating. Strong community and support of well-known people like Elon Musk have driven it into the forefront. Its attraction is still essentially speculative, though, with no obvious use case or technological innovation supporting its market worth. Meme coins' long-term viability is called into question as financial authorities' increased scrutiny of them Though Dogecoin is a fan favorite, both established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum as well as more recent initiatives with more sensible value propositions oppose it. For Dogecoin holders, the SEC's latest remarks regarding meme coins not falling under securities rules was welcome. It is currently priced at $0.1671 But this lack of regulatory control could also indicate a possible drop in investor interest, especially among those who want their investments to be practically useful. Remittix: The $0.07 Altcoin With the Potential to Reach $4 At just $0.0734 , Remittix has generated over $13.8 million in presale sales exceeding 517 million RTX tokens. Remittix presents a clear, practical way to cross-border payments unlike speculative assets like Dogecoin and XRP. Remittix's PayFi system enables flawless crypto-to--fiat transactions free of foreign exchange costs given the worldwide remittance industry valued at $190 trillion. Remittix is poised to upset the remittance business by removing inefficiencies in conventional money transfers. Its capacity to provide quick, low-cost transactions and fit with current financial systems helps it stand out from XRP, which mostly addresses institutional payments. Targeting individuals and small companies, Remittix positions itself for significant expansion in the blockchain-based financial industry. Remittix’s Strong Presale Success and Growing Investor Interest Remittix has caused a stir with its successful presale, attracting both retail and institutional investors. The fact that the platform is easily effective within existing financial systems and addresses the inefficiencies of the global remittance market makes it a standout in the crypto space. With the growing need for blockchain-based payment systems, Remittix will be a force to reckon with in cross-border payments. Analysts estimate Remittix to reach $4 within the next 100 days, driven by the increasing adoption of its technology, growing remittance market, and differentiated value proposition. Unlike speculative meme coins such as XRP and Dogecoin with regulatory pressures and no real-world use case, Remittix offers real-world utility through the PayFi platform. This positions it well versus speculative assets and as a stronger growth play in 2025. As it keeps racking up presale success, real-world use case, and disruptive potential in the conventional remittance service, Remittix is poised for long-term growth. For investors who are in search of the best crypto to buy now, Remittix is a suitable option, with plenty of upside potential in the coming months.

""Must Be Solved Urgently!""",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/tron-founder-justin-sun-issues-ethereum-eth-warning-must-be-solved-urgently/,"Tron (TRX) founder Justin Sun drew attention to the excessive leverage problem in the Ethereum ecosystem in his post from the X account. Justin Sun addressed the Ethereum leverage issue and called for proactive measures. Sun noted that excessive leverage should be brought under control rather than waiting for a crash that could wreak havoc on Ethereum protocols and decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. He emphasised the need for early intervention and a coordinated solution. Many investors are increasingly using leverage of up to 50x (sometimes 100x) when trading ETH on major platforms. This high leverage also leads to excessive liquidation risks when price volatility increases. “In the short term, Ethereum also needs to address the widespread leverage issue. “It would be better to intervene early and unwind some of the leverage rather than wait for the protocols and DeFi projects to crash, causing losses. A negotiated solution is recommended.” https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1899391401672216839 *This is not investment advice.

With its decentralized lending model and real-world financial applications, this under-$0.10 crypto is proving to be more than just another token launch. As the presale moves forward, investors are taking note of its growing momentum, seeing it as a project with both immediate potential and long-term sustainability. Unlike speculative tokens that rely on market hype, MUTM offers a structured DeFi ecosystem where users can lend, borrow, and earn passive income. The rapid sellout of its presale phases, combined with its upcoming exchange listing, has fueled bullish sentiment among investors. With interest continuing to grow, many are now wondering if this is the best time to secure a position before the next price jump. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been gaining significant traction as its presale progresses rapidly. With over 5,050 holders and $3 million already raised, the project is drawing attention from investors looking for early opportunities in DeFi. As the presale moves into its next phase, the token price has surged by 33%, rising from $0.015 to $0.02, reinforcing strong demand. Those who secured their positions early are already seeing gains, while new investors are taking notice before the next price increase. What sets Mutuum Finance apart is its focus on real-world financial utility. Unlike purely speculative assets, MUTM is designed to support decentralized lending, allowing users to supply and borrow assets without relying on intermediaries. The platform provides two lending models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C), where users earn yield by supplying liquidity, and Peer-to-Peer (P2P), which enables direct lending agreements between users, including for riskier assets like SHIB and PEPE. Every transaction is executed through a smart contract, ensuring security and transparency, with an audit planned by a well-known blockchain security firm. Another key component driving investor confidence is Mutuum Finance’s buy-and-distribute mechanism. This model ensures consistent buy pressure by using a portion of platform revenue to purchase MUTM from the market. These tokens are then distributed to mtToken stakers, reducing sell pressure while rewarding long-term holders. This built-in demand mechanism is expected to contribute to sustained price growth beyond the presale phase. With its strong financial model and practical utility, Mutuum Finance is positioned for long-term growth. Unlike hype-driven tokens, its lending protocol and buy-and-distribute mechanism create sustained demand, making it an attractive option for investors looking for more than short-term gains. Given its expanding ecosystem and increasing adoption, experts predict that MUTM could reach $1 by Q2 2025, fueled by platform utility, growing user participation, and continued interest from major investors. As the project advances, its structured approach to decentralized lending is expected to solidify its place among the top DeFi tokens. Beyond its lending protocol, the Mutuum Finance team is also developing an overcollateralized stablecoin, designed to provide users with a secure, decentralized alternative to traditional stable assets. Unlike centralized options, this stablecoin will be backed entirely by on-chain collateral, ensuring transparency and stability. Mutuum Finance is further fueling investor interest with a $100,000 giveaway, rewarding early supporters and building strong community engagement. This initiative offers participants a chance to secure additional MUTM tokens ahead of the exchange listing. Full details and entry requirements can be found on the official Mutuum Finance website. With exchange listings on the horizon and a beta version of the platform launching alongside the token’s debut, Mutuum Finance is shaping up to be a strong contender in the DeFi space. As the presale continues to attract both retail and institutional investors, the project’s momentum suggests that those getting in now could be well-positioned for future gains.

Arctic Pablo Coin Presale Heats Up – While Dogecoin’s AI Trading and Popcat’s Expansion Make Waves!,https://thecoinrise.com/from-token-burns-to-unstoppable-momentum-arctic-pablo-coin-presale-heats-up-while-dogecoins-ai-trading-and-popcats-expansion-make-waves/,"Have you ever wished you could catch the next big crypto before it explodes? With meme coins rewriting the rules of investment, traders are constantly searching for the next high-potential gem. Recently, Dogecoin and Popcat have made waves in the crypto world with significant updates, but all eyes are on Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) , a fresh and innovative meme coin that’s already creating a massive buzz. With a revolutionary presale model and an aggressive token burn mechanism, Arctic Pablo Coin stands out from the rest. This article will cover the latest developments in Arctic Pablo Coin, Dogecoin, and Popcat, showcasing why these three projects are among the Top Meme Coins to Invest. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Deflationary Strategy: Token Burns Fuel Scarcity One of Arctic Pablo Coin’s most compelling features is its deflationary token burn mechanism. Unlike many meme coins that flood the market with excessive supply, APC is actively reducing token availability, making each remaining coin more valuable. Every week during the presale, unsold tokens are permanently eliminated, ensuring a controlled supply. Additionally, any tokens left after the presale will also be burned, fostering long-term scarcity. This deflationary model is backed by Binance Smart Chain (BSC), ensuring transparency and verifiable transactions. By limiting the circulating supply, Arctic Pablo Coin positions itself as a meme coin with real value potential, making it a strong contender among the top meme coins to invest. Arctic Pablo Presale Surge: Frosty Falls Marks a Critical Entry Point The Arctic Pablo meme coin presale is turning heads as it enters Frosty Falls, the 14th phase of its thrilling journey. With each new location, the price of APC increases, making early entry crucial for those looking to maximize gains. Right now, the price per APC stands at just $0.000074, but with a launch price of $0.008, investors at this stage are looking at a staggering 10,694.59% ROI potential. Over $1.83 million has already been raised, proving strong market interest. With such momentum, the presale could reach the next phase at any moment, driving prices even higher. The unique presale structure sets Arctic Pablo Coin apart from the competition. Instead of traditional stages, the presale follows an adventurous travel-themed model where Arctic Pablo moves through different locations, creating anticipation and excitement. The closer the coin gets to its launch, the higher the price climbs. With limited time before the next price jump, now is the best opportunity to secure APC at its lowest possible price. Once Frosty Falls is left behind, those who waited might regret missing out on the most lucrative phase. Dogecoin Breakthrough: Revolutionary AI-Powered Trading Features Dogecoin continues to redefine decentralized trading with its latest AI-powered enhancements. The project recently introduced a smart analytics tool that enables investors to make informed decisions based on real-time market trends. By integrating predictive algorithms, Dogecoin is simplifying crypto trading for newcomers while offering advanced insights for seasoned traders. With an increasing number of users adopting its platform, Dogecoin is positioning itself as a strong competitor in the crypto space. While it remains an exciting project, Arctic Pablo Coin’s unique presale dynamics and scarcity-driven model give it an edge in the race among the top new meme coins to invest. Popcat Expansion: Community-Driven Growth Continues Popcat, a Cardano-based meme coin, has been gaining traction due to its strong community engagement and innovative staking rewards. The latest update reveals that Popcat has successfully expanded its liquidity pools, providing more stability and accessibility for traders. Additionally, the project’s development team has teased upcoming partnerships that could drive further adoption. While Popcat continues to build its ecosystem, Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale hype and deflationary strategy put it in the spotlight, making it the standout option for those looking to invest in the top new meme coins to invest. Conclusion: Why Arctic Pablo Coin Leads the Charge The meme coin market is heating up with exciting projects like Arctic Pablo Coin, Dogecoin, and Popcat making headlines. Dogecoin is pushing the boundaries of AI-driven trading, while Popcat’s community-driven approach continues to strengthen its foothold. However, Arctic Pablo Coin’s deflationary model, rapid presale progression, and skyrocketing ROI potential set it apart as the most promising opportunity. With Frosty Falls marking a critical moment in its presale, Arctic Pablo Coin is on the verge of another price increase. This could be the last chance to secure APC at a fraction of its projected launch value. As the presale advances, those who act now could see the biggest gains. Don’t miss out—Arctic Pablo Coin is leading the charge among the top new meme coins to invest. For More Information: Arctic Pablo Coin : https://www.arcticpablo.com/ Telegram : https://t.me/ArcticPabloOfficial Twitter: https://x.com/arcticpabloHQ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What makes the Arctic Pablo Coin different from other meme coins? Arctic Pablo Coin features a unique presale structure, a deflationary token burn mechanism, and a travel-themed progression, making it a standout investment. How does the Arctic Pablo Coin presale work? Instead of traditional stages, the presale moves through different locations, increasing the price at each new stop. Currently, it is at Frosty Falls. Why is the Arctic Pablo Coin burn mechanism important? The weekly token burns reduce supply, making APC scarcer and potentially more valuable over time. What is the ROI potential of Arctic Pablo Coin? At the current price of $0.000074, early investors could see an ROI of over 10,694.59% by the time APC reaches its listing price of $0.008. Where can I buy Arctic Pablo Coin? Investors can purchase APC through the official Arctic Pablo Coin website during the presale phase before it launches on major exchanges.

Before the funds launched in July, several issuers included staking in their applications. However, the SEC later required them to remove the feature , as the Commission was not allowing it at the time. Cboe, which is associated with five of the issuers of an ether ETF, including Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, VanEck, and Invesco/Galaxy, on Tuesday, filed amended 19b-4 documents for the Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) and the Franklin Ethereum ETF (EZET), to allow staking. The move comes after former SEC chair Gary Gensler left the Commission; he resigned shortly before the inauguration of crypto-friendly President Donald Trump in January. Trump's nominee to run the SEC, Paul Atkins, hasn't been scheduled for a hearing or confirmation vote in the Senate yet. Commissioner Mark Uyeda is the acting chair until Atkins is sworn in. Under Uyeda's watch, the SEC has made several positive moves in regards to other crypto-related ETF applications, spurring hope that staking might see a positive response from Commissioners. Cboe’s request to stake will likely be approved, said James Seyffart, ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “There’s still things that need to be sorted but we expect the SEC will allow staking in the ETFs this year,” he said. Beyond adding staking, companies have filed to launch ETF products for a range of digital assets. In the last week, companies set up Delaware companies for Sui (SUI) and Aptos (APT), and the SEC is already reviewing several applications for Solana (SOL) and XRP (XRP), among others.",Markets|Ether ETFs,EN,0,0,REGULATION|ETH|APT|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-11 15:49:41

The post, which was later deleted, accused members of the DeFiTuna team of exploiting the meme coin market for personal gain. However, Meteora quickly distanced itself from the statement, claiming that Chow’s account had been compromised. Hack Confirmed: Are The Allegations True? Meteora’s official X account confirmed that unauthorized access had been gained but was subsequently restored. https://twitter.com/MeteoraAG/status/1899278675960647784 Chow’s alleged statement, which included purported evidence of insider dealings, added another layer of complexity to the situation. In response, co-founder Meow reaffirmed confidence in Meteora and Jupiter’s integrity while announcing an independent investigation to clear any doubts. Beyond Meteora, the situation took a political turn as Argentine President Javier Milei faced backlash for endorsing the LIBRA token, which skyrocketed in value before a massive sell-off wiped out millions in investor funds. The Controversial Meme Coin Post and Its Fallout The drama began on March 11 when Ben Chow’s X account posted what was framed as an “official statement” regarding his resignation from Meteora. In the now-deleted post, Chow claimed that members of DeFiTuna, including Vlad Pozniakov and Dhirk, engaged in predatory practices designed to extract maximum value from meme coin launches. The post referenced MELANIA, MATES, and a Raydium-based launch and alleged insider sniping and wallet activity that resulted in millions of dollars in profits. Chow’s statement further accused Kelsier Ventures CEO Hayden Davis and COO Gideon Davis of discussing these extraction strategies, referencing WhatsApp conversations in which one participant allegedly stated, “Yeah, fellas, tbh, we are trying to max extract on this one.” However, Meteora’s official X account quickly intervened, warning users not to trust the statement and asserting that Chow’s account had been hacked. https://twitter.com/realdezen/status/1899279754488098950 Shortly after, Meteora confirmed that they had regained control of both their official account and Chow’s, although Chow himself did not respond to media inquiries regarding the situation. Before today, Feb 18, Meteora co-founder Meow publicly stated that while he stood by Chow’s integrity, he acknowledged Chow’s failure to exercise proper judgment in recent months. Meow also confirmed that Fenwick & West had commissioned an independent third-party investigation to review any allegations of financial misconduct. https://twitter.com/weremeow/status/1891664435321647186 Despite this, Chow has officially resigned , and the company is now seeking new leadership. Meme coins, Political Endorsements, and Industry-Wide Repercussions The Meteora controversy has affected the company and put more spotlight on all involved parties. Argentine President Javier Milei recently became the center of a financial scandal after publicly recommending the LIBRA token. Following his endorsement, LIBRA’s value surged from nearly zero to $5 , briefly reaching a staggering $4 billion market capitalization before plummeting in a massive sell-off that left many investors at a loss. https://twitter.com/cryptonews/status/1891854722241302838 Milei dismissed accusations of a rug pull , arguing that his token promotion aligned with his broader free-market philosophy. However, critics claim that his involvement in such a volatile and speculative market has put his administration under scrutiny. https://twitter.com/cryptonews/status/1891729034255470841 Calls for his impeachment have surfaced, with detractors arguing that his actions represent a dangerous intersection of political influence and financial manipulation. At this point, it is clear that the controversy surrounding Meteora and Milei’s endorsement of LIBRA has taken a new turn with the latest whistle blown. After concluding their investigations, the community is waiting for what the Meteora team has to say, as many in the crypto community are already wondering who all the involved parties are.

The digital asset realm is buzzing with news of a significant move by a major player. On-chain data reveals that Cumberland DRW, a well-known crypto market maker, has just made a substantial commitment to the Solana network. They’ve staked a whopping $5.72 million worth of SOL. This isn’t just pocket change; it’s a clear signal of institutional interest and a potential catalyst for further growth in the Solana ecosystem. Let’s dive into what this means for you and the broader crypto landscape. Decoding the $5.72M SOL Staking Move So, what exactly happened? According to the eagle-eyed on-chain analyst Onchain Lens, a wallet linked to Cumberland DRW initiated a significant transaction about two hours ago. This transaction involved staking 48,182 SOL tokens. At the current valuation, this stake amounts to a cool $5.72 million. For those unfamiliar, staking in crypto is akin to depositing money in a bank to earn interest. By locking up their SOL tokens, Cumberland DRW is contributing to the Solana network’s security and operational efficiency, and in return, they’ll likely earn staking rewards. Think of it as a win-win scenario – they support the network and generate passive income. Why is SOL Staking Gaining Traction? SOL staking has become increasingly popular for several compelling reasons. Let’s break down the benefits: Passive Income Generation: Staking SOL offers a way to earn rewards simply by holding and locking up your tokens. It’s a relatively low-risk method to increase your crypto holdings over time. Network Security and Support: By staking, you contribute to the security and decentralization of the Solana network. A stronger, more secure network benefits everyone involved. Relatively High APY (Annual Percentage Yield): Compared to traditional savings accounts or even some other staking options, SOL staking can offer attractive APYs, making it a potentially lucrative option for crypto holders. Ease of Participation: Staking SOL is generally straightforward. Many exchanges and wallets offer user-friendly interfaces to stake your tokens with just a few clicks. Belief in Solana’s Future: Staking often reflects a long-term belief in the underlying cryptocurrency and its ecosystem. Investors are essentially betting on the future success and growth of Solana. Cumberland DRW: A Crypto Market Maker’s Power Move Who exactly is Cumberland DRW, and why does their crypto market maker activity matter? Cumberland DRW is a prominent global crypto market maker, part of the larger DRW trading group. They play a crucial role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem by providing liquidity and facilitating trading across various exchanges and platforms. Their involvement often signals institutional interest and maturity in the crypto space. When a firm like Cumberland DRW makes a significant move, like staking millions in SOL, it’s worth paying attention to. It suggests a strong conviction in the asset and its potential. Institutional Investment Fuels Solana’s Growth This institutional investment from Cumberland DRW is not an isolated event. We’ve seen a growing trend of institutional players dipping their toes, and sometimes diving headfirst, into the crypto market. Why is this significant? Validation of Crypto as an Asset Class: When established financial institutions invest in crypto, it lends further legitimacy to the asset class as a whole. Increased Market Liquidity: Institutional participation typically brings more capital and liquidity into the market, potentially leading to more stable and efficient trading. Catalyst for Price Appreciation: Large investments from institutions can act as a catalyst for price appreciation, as they signal confidence and attract further investment. Broader Adoption: Institutional involvement often paves the way for wider mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies, as it reduces perceived risk and encourages retail investors. Solana: Poised for Continued Expansion? The Solana blockchain has been making waves in the crypto world due to its high speed and low transaction costs. Is this Solana staking move by Cumberland DRW a sign of even bigger things to come for the network? Solana has several factors working in its favor: Technological Advantages: Solana’s architecture allows for significantly faster transaction speeds and lower fees compared to some older blockchains like Ethereum, making it attractive for various applications, including DeFi and NFTs. Growing Ecosystem: The Solana ecosystem is rapidly expanding, with a growing number of projects and applications being built on the network. Strong Community Support: Solana boasts a vibrant and active community of developers and users, which is crucial for the long-term success of any blockchain project. Focus on Scalability: Solana’s focus on scalability positions it well to handle the increasing demands of the growing crypto space. Actionable Insights: What Can You Learn from This? So, what are the key takeaways for you, the crypto enthusiast or investor? Pay Attention to Institutional Moves: Keep an eye on what institutional players like Cumberland DRW are doing. Their actions can often provide valuable insights into market trends and potential opportunities. Explore SOL Staking: If you’re holding SOL, consider exploring staking as a way to earn passive income and support the network. Research different staking platforms and understand the associated risks and rewards. Stay Informed about Solana’s Development: Keep up-to-date with the latest developments in the Solana ecosystem. New projects, partnerships, and upgrades can all impact the value and potential of SOL. Diversify Your Portfolio: While Solana shows promise, remember the importance of diversification in any investment portfolio. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Conclusion: A Powerful Signal for Solana and the Crypto Market Cumberland DRW’s $5.72 million SOL staking venture is more than just a transaction; it’s a powerful signal. It underscores the growing institutional confidence in Solana and the broader crypto market. This move highlights the increasing maturity of the crypto space and the potential for further growth and adoption. As institutional giants like Cumberland DRW continue to make strategic investments in crypto, it reinforces the narrative that digital assets are here to stay and are becoming an increasingly integral part of the global financial landscape.

In an otherwise subdued market sentiment, BMT gained more than 49% during its early price discovery stage. Bubblemaps launched its new BMT token for DEX trading on Raydium and PancakeSwap, quickly becoming one of the top gainers for the day despite the muted market sentiment. Bubblemaps established itself as one of the most useful analytics tools during the meme token season, helping identify insider ownership and sniping. BMT started its price discovery after a listing on Raydium, trading in a range between $0.11 and $0.14. The initial trading reached volumes of $29M, based on 256M tokens in circulation out of the 1B supply. The BMT airdrop is available to all V2 users who showed activity and sent out invites. The top 1,000 users received a 20,000 BMT allocation. BMT had a volatile day as a DEX token, peaking at $0.35 before returning to the $0.12 range. | Source: DexScreener Bubblemaps also revealed the official token smart contracts on Solana and BNB Smart Chain to avoid confusion with copycat assets. Bubblemaps is in the early stages of Raydium trading and expects to have pairs in most of the major centralized markets. The Bubblemaps airdrop used a random distribution based on a lottery principle to avoid bots and impersonating wallets. The token had limited early sniping, with even top traders only realizing $244K in gains. The token’s whole supply will be split between Solana and BNB Smart Chain, tapping two highly active communities. 88% of the tokens will remain on Solana, with 12% issued on BNB Smart Chain, using the Layer Zero cross-chain standard. Initially, most of the BMT tokens remain locked in the issuer address, but they will be moved to a smart contract that will distribute more of the assets over time to all groups of investors and contributors. Part of the BMT supply was also distributed to Binance Wallet users in a presale event with maximum participation of 3 BNB. The new tokens were available to early buyers at $0.02, a fraction of the decentralized price, which peaked at around $0.25. Binance’s event relied on a preliminary subscription and a proportional share of the tokens. The event aimed at popularizing BMT for a wider audience, though with relatively low holdings. Bubblemaps adds utility to BMT tokens The basis of BMT tokenomics will be the usage within the Bubblemaps ecosystem. BMT will be used to further investigations into other projects and their on-chain structure. Bubblemaps will launch its Intel Desk, a facility where users will submit cases, vote, and allocate on-chain investigation resources. The token is mintable, and will be used to incentivize the usage of the Intel Desk, as well as recruiting investigators. The token’s main feature will be the ability to unlock advanced features on Bubblemaps V2. The new version allows better visuals that help to identify insider holdings, connected wallets, and wash trading. Bubblemaps has already received requests to do investigations on specific tokens and chains. With so many new launches, Bubblemaps will use the BMT token to limit the investigation requests and vote for the most urgent ones. BMT will be used to propose, vote and decide on the most urgent investigations. Proposers will earn BMT rewards, while Voters will receive the first access to sensitive data about tokens. Contributors will also receive incentives to research tokens more deeply. Bubblemaps continues the analytics token trend The launch of a Bubblemaps token extends the trend of capitalizing on the value of crypto analytics companies. The most recent similar launch was from Kaito, a builder of social media analytics tools. Analytics layer projects aim to bring additional utility before offering a token to avoid the reputational loss of a crashing asset. KAITO tokens traded at $1.35, down from a peak of $2.86. The KAITO tokens were distributed to high-profile power users, but even the influencers realized profits in the first hours since the launch. KAITO was sold soon after the airdrop, as even high-profile influencers took profits immediately. | Source: Coingecko Bubblemaps is the second analytics protocol to launch a token. Despite the utility, there are fears BMT will be shorted or sold in the early stages of trading. The other two potential airdrops from analytics platforms include Arkham Intelligence and Nansen. So far, the companies are in the pre-airdrop stage with no known date for the token generation event. Arkham’s airdrop relies on interacting with the app and trading on the project’s decentralized exchange. Nansen’s airdrop is unconfirmed, though new users may join the platform for a chance of eligibility. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Experts Believe This Crypto Will Follow the Same Path,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/remember-how-polygon-hit-250x-after-binance-listing-experts-believe-this-crypto-will-follow-the-same-path,"Polygon's exponential growth once took the crypto space by surprise when it went 250x after being listed on Binance. This kind of explosive growth further reiterated how a technically strong project, combined with exchange support, can give life-altering returns. Now, commentators are seeing the same dynamics at play in a new DeFi entrant named Remittix, a cross-border payments network that is set to disrupt a trillion-dollar remittance industry. Although Polygon is still a top Ethereum scaling solution, it is being rivaled by newcomers in the DeFi space. We give below Polygon's key milestones prior to exploring why insiders think Remittix can emulate—and even better—the sidechain's iconic success. Polygon: A Layer-2 Heavyweight Eyes $1 Polygon is the biggest Ethereum scaling solution, with more than $911 million in total value locked (TVL) as of January 2024 . Developers launched Polygon 2.0 last year, an upgrade that aims to transform the sidechain into a general ""value layer of the internet."" They also switched from MATIC to POL, a token with greater utility in Polygon's multi-layer ecosystem. In Q4 2024, Polygon's token surged almost 175% from November lows to approach $0.76. Now, optimistic watchers think altcoin season will push POL past the significant $0.75 resistance. If so, the next psychological barrier is $1, with some analysts foreseeing even more robust uptrends if general market sentiment stays positive. In spite of the network's success, it is wise to remember that a lot of Polygon's significant jump occurred following its listing on Binance, which exponentially increased liquidity and exposure. That milestone highlighted how valuable good market exposure is. For new coins, generating hype early and bringing in presale funds can also set the stage for future exchange listings—and the massive returns that typically ensue. Remittix: The Cross-Border Disruptor Aiming for 250x Remittix (RTX) is already one of the most highly demanded DeFi projects of 2025, having raised more than $13.8 million and sold 517 million tokens during its presale. Priced at only $0.0734, many compare it to Polygon's pre-listing days when it built a cult following under the radar before blowing up on the major exchanges. By addressing cross-border payments, Remittix is going after a $190 trillion worldwide remittance market beset by delayed transaction times and concealed charges. Picture a Canadian student sending monthly rent for a Vietnamese family home: under conventional techniques, the transfer could take days and typically carry additional fees. Remittix's PayFi framework is looking to reduce that to minutes, exchanging crypto for fiat and placing it in the recipient's bank for little or no additional cost. Its payment API allows businesses to receive payment in more than 40 cryptocurrencies and settle automatically in fiat, with all transactions being written on a secure public ledger. This multi-currency convenience and simplified processing eliminate friction for freelancers, migrant workers, and e-commerce merchants alike. Analysts think that kind of real-world use case sets Remittix up for an explosive burst once it notches large-name listings. In the meantime, locked liquidity and a clear governance roadmap highlight Remittix's dedication to stability—factors that were instrumental in Polygon achieving long-term trust. Could Remittix Follow Polygon’s Path to Triple-Digit Multipliers? Analysts point to several reasons why Remittix can tread in Polygon's past footsteps. For one, just as Polygon did in its early days, Remittix offers a solution with real-world utility. Instead of incremental updates to existing blockchains, Remittix addresses high-friction remittance pain points that afflict millions. Solutions to big problems usually capture huge market share once they are listed on larger exchanges. Second, Remittix tokenomics and presale strategy remind one of success stories from the past. Selling tokens cheaply, locking in liquidity, and demonstrating mettle in a bear market, it's won over investors. Polygon followed the same path, developing an active base of support before more mainstream attention. As the sidechain solution started to gain more traction, the token price exploded and delivered that legendary 250x.

The NFT collection comprises a limited mint of 2,121 Wizards . The Wizards were inscribed two years ago. This, the team says, makes them “one of the most highly anticipated NFT collections across all blockchains.” Meanwhile, the team stated that the Whitelist Wizards will go for 0.2 BTC. To get on the whitelist, participants had to complete ‘quests’ and will have to fund their wallets by 19 March. Holders of two ‘entangled’ Quantum Cats will be able to buy a Taproot Wizard at a discounted price of 0.1 BTC. The other wizards will be sold on a Dutch auction. The sale will take place on the mint website . Notably, “each collectible lives entirely on the Bitcoin blockchain using Ordinals,” said the press release. Per the announcement shared with Cryptonews , this project “harkens back to the original Bitcoin Wizard Reddit meme of 2013.” The NFTs are described as “magic internet JPEGs” on a mission to “make bitcoin magical.” Source: Paul Bars, Medium Meanwhile, this is a Bitcoin Ordinals project. Via Ordinals, users can inscribe data into the Bitcoin blockchain, creating NFTs on this network that’s not well-known for this token type.

This collection celebrates the ‘ OP_CAT ‘ Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) that will enable novel smart contract functionality for Bitcoin, says the announcement. Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto “originally included OP_CAT in Bitcoin but later disabled it,” and “many Bitcoin developers support bringing it back,” it added. Meanwhile, on February 4, Taproot Wizards said it raised $30 million, led by Standard Crypto , “indicating institutional support for building on Bitcoin.” The team will use the funds to build out an ecosystem of OP_CAT applications and protocols.

Cboe BZX Exchange is seeking to amend the wording in a move that could see investors earn additional rewards from staking activities. Fresh Filing To Include Staking In Fidelity’s Ethereum ETF Cboe BZX Exchange has filed a proposal with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to amend the Fidelity Ethereum ETF. According to the filing , the move seeks to introduce ETH staking in the fund, allowing investors to reap additional rewards. A community reading of the documents reveals that Cboe BZX is seeking the elimination of a clause that specifically bars staking in the ETH. Under the new proposal, Cboe BZX Exchange wants the SEC to approve staking functionalities under certain guidelines. “The Sponsor may stake, or cause to be staked, all or a portion of the Trust’s ether through one or more trusted staking providers,” read the filing. Cboe says the application for staking has statutory backing and will ultimately assist the Trust “to better track the returns associated with holding ether.” Ethereum introduced staking in 2022 following its transition from a Proof-of-Work to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. Proposed Rules For ETH Staking According to the 18-page filing document, the ETF’s sponsor pledges to maintain sufficient liquidity for redemption purposes. The document confirms a pledge that the staking activities will not violate the SEC’s standing rules on securities avoiding commingling of funds. The sponsor will stake ETH to preserve the Trust’s assets and to “generate returns for shareholders. Per the document, the custodian will control private keys for the withdrawal address. The SEC has 45 days to respond to the proposal with enthusiasts saying that the new forward-thinking approach by the securities watchdog may result in an approval. The recent dismissal of the Kraken case and declaration that memecoins are not securities indicate a changing stance by the SEC. Ethereum price did not react to the news with the largest altcoin roiling at well under $2,000. Despite whale activity heating up, an Ethereum falling to $1,000 remains a grim possibility.

On March 10th, these investment vehicles experienced a concerning wave of net outflows, totaling a staggering $279.02 million. This marks the sixth consecutive trading day of net negative flows, prompting questions about investor sentiment and the short-term trajectory of Bitcoin ETF outflows . Why are Bitcoin ETF Outflows Causing Concern? The sustained period of Bitcoin ETF outflows raises eyebrows within the crypto community. After the initial euphoria and massive inflows following the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., this reversal sparks discussions about market corrections and potential shifts in investor strategy. Are investors taking profits, or is there a deeper concern driving this exodus? Let’s break down the specifics. Decoding the Data: Who Faced the Biggest Outflows? Trader T (@thepfund) on X brought this critical data to light, revealing a detailed breakdown of which ETFs experienced the most significant Bitcoin ETF outflows . Here’s a closer look at the numbers: Fidelity’s FBTC: Leading the pack with a substantial $134.04 million in net outflows. BlackRock’s IBIT: Following closely behind with $89.70 million in net outflows. It’s notable that even BlackRock, a giant in asset management, experienced significant withdrawals. Grayscale’s GBTC: Continuing its trend, GBTC saw $20.60 million in net outflows. GBTC has been under pressure due to its higher fees compared to newer ETFs. Invesco’s BTCO: Recorded $14.20 million in net outflows. Franklin Templeton’s EZBC: Experienced $13.64 million in net outflows. Bitwise’s BITB: Not spared, with $6.84 million in net outflows. Interestingly, the remaining spot Bitcoin ETFs reported no changes in their holdings on March 10th. This concentrated outflow in the aforementioned ETFs suggests a potentially targeted shift in investment strategy rather than a broad-based panic across all Bitcoin ETFs. Spot Bitcoin ETF Performance: A Quick Recap Spot Bitcoin ETFs were launched with the promise of providing mainstream investors with easier access to Bitcoin exposure without directly holding the cryptocurrency. They quickly became a hot commodity, attracting billions in assets under management (AUM). Here’s a table summarizing the performance of the ETFs mentioned in the news: ETF Provider Net Outflows (March 10) FBTC Fidelity $134.04 million IBIT BlackRock $89.70 million GBTC Grayscale $20.60 million BTCO Invesco $14.20 million EZBC Franklin Templeton $13.64 million BITB Bitwise $6.84 million While the initial inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs were robust, the recent outflows highlight the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market and the potential for rapid shifts in investor sentiment. Crypto Market Trends and ETF Investment Strategy: What’s Next? Understanding these Bitcoin ETF outflows requires considering the broader crypto market trends . Several factors could be at play: Profit Taking: After a significant price rally in Bitcoin and the broader crypto market, some investors might be taking profits, leading to outflows from ETFs. Market Correction: The outflows could signal a broader market correction. Investors might be de-risking their portfolios in anticipation of potential price declines. GBTC Fee Structure: Grayscale’s GBTC, with its higher management fees compared to newer ETFs, has consistently seen outflows as investors potentially migrate to lower-fee options. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic uncertainty, inflation concerns, and interest rate hikes can influence investor sentiment and lead to shifts in investment strategies, including within the crypto space. For investors, this period of Bitcoin ETF outflows serves as a reminder of the importance of diversification and risk management in their ETF investment strategy . While Bitcoin and crypto offer potential for high returns, they also come with significant volatility. Grayscale GBTC: Continuing Outflow Pressures As highlighted in the data, Grayscale GBTC continues to experience outflows. This trend is not new and has been attributed to several factors: Higher Fees: GBTC’s management fee is notably higher than many of the newer spot Bitcoin ETFs, making it less attractive for cost-conscious investors. Conversion from Trust to ETF: The conversion process from a trust to an ETF might have unlocked shares for some investors who were looking to liquidate their holdings. Competition: The emergence of numerous competing spot Bitcoin ETFs with lower fees has provided investors with more options, drawing assets away from GBTC. The ongoing outflows from Grayscale GBTC are a key element in the overall narrative of Bitcoin ETF outflows and market dynamics. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what can investors glean from these Bitcoin ETF outflows ? Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on daily ETF flow data and broader market trends to understand shifts in investor sentiment. Review Your Portfolio: Assess your risk tolerance and diversification strategy. Consider if your crypto allocation is aligned with your overall financial goals. Consider ETF Fees: When choosing a Bitcoin ETF, compare management fees and select options that align with your cost sensitivity. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that crypto markets are volatile. Focus on the long-term potential of Bitcoin and avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term market fluctuations. Conclusion: Navigating the Evolving Crypto ETF Landscape The $279.02 million net outflow from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on March 10th is a significant data point that warrants attention. While it may signal a temporary market correction or profit-taking phase, it also underscores the inherent volatility and evolving dynamics of the cryptocurrency market. Investors should use this as an opportunity to reassess their strategies, stay informed about crypto market trends , and make well-informed decisions regarding their ETF investment strategy . The world of spot Bitcoin ETFs and Bitcoin ETF outflows is constantly changing, and staying agile is key to navigating this exciting yet unpredictable asset class.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 400 points (0.9%), the S&P 500 fell 0.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite managed to hold a 0.1% gain, according to data from CNBC. The S&P 500 is now sitting less than 1% away from correction territory, a red flag for traders who have been watching equities bleed for weeks. Magnificent 7 stocks | Source: The Kobeissi Letter via X The sell-off came after Trump posted on Truth Social, doubling tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum from 25% to 50%, effective Wednesday. This, of course, is part of the ongoing trade war that has already hammered stocks, with previous tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada driving massive losses. In his post, Trump justified the move by pointing at Ontario’s 25% tariff on U.S. electricity and Canada’s massive dairy tariffs. Trump warns Canada of more tariffs Trump didn’t stop at steel and aluminum. He warned that if Canada doesn’t remove tariffs on U.S. dairy, he will slap new duties on Canadian-made cars by April 2nd, threatening to cripple the country’s auto industry. His post read: “Based on Ontario, Canada, placing a 25% Tariff on ‘Electricity’ coming into the United States, I have instructed my Secretary of Commerce to add an ADDITIONAL 25% Tariff, to 50%, on all STEEL and ALUMINUM COMING INTO THE UNITED STATES FROM CANADA, ONE OF THE HIGHEST TARIFFING NATIONS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. This will go into effect TOMORROW MORNING, March 12th.” He also called for Canada to immediately drop its ‘Anti-American Farmer Tariff’ of 250% to 390% on U.S. dairy products, calling it “outrageous.” If that doesn’t happen, Trump said auto tariffs are next, a move that analysts say could wreck Canada’s auto manufacturing sector. Adding fuel to the fire, Trump threatened to declare a National Emergency on Electricity, claiming that Canada’s policies are an “abusive threat” to the U.S. economy. Trump also once again floated the idea of Canada becoming the 51st U.S. state. In a separate post on Truth Social, he said that if Canada joined the U.S., all tariffs would disappear, taxes would drop, and the two countries would become “bigger, better, and stronger than ever.” “The only thing that makes sense is for Canada to become our cherished Fifty-First State. This would make all Tariffs, and everything else, totally disappear,” Trump wrote. He continued: “Canadians’ taxes will be very substantially reduced, they will be more secure, militarily and otherwise, than ever before, there would no longer be a Northern Border problem, and the greatest and most powerful nation in the World will be bigger, better and stronger than ever — And Canada will be a big part of that.” Bitcoin seems to stabilize, but a short squeeze might be coming for stocks Investors have had enough. The Nasdaq Composite has now plunged more than 10% from its record high in late 2024, officially entering correction territory. The S&P 500 is down 9% from its peak in February, and the Dow Jones is sliding further away from its 200-day moving average. The collapse was enough for Citigroup to lower its rating on U.S. stocks, citing a “pause in U.S. exceptionalism” as their reasoning. Bitcoin price chart | Source: TradingView (Jai Hamid) While stocks crash, Bitcoin seems to be holding its ground. After falling to $76,000 earlier, it has bounced back to $81,300 at press time, per data from CoinGecko. The crypto market’s stability is catching attention, with traders wondering if it’s a sign that equities might also find a bottom soon. Some analysts believe stocks are set for a short squeeze. Since February 19th, the S&P 500 has erased $5 trillion in market value, marking its worst one-sided selloff since the 2022 bear market. Hedge funds have noticed, seeing as total PUT option volumes hit a record-breaking 30 million contracts over the past five days, an unprecedented level of bearish positioning, according to CME. But new data from Goldman Sachs shows that hedge funds are starting to turn net positive on equities, which could trigger a violent rebound in stocks. US total put option volumes (5-day moving average) | Source: ZeroHedge Adding to the speculation, Trump posted about Tesla stock, saying he was buying a new Tesla “as a show of confidence” in Elon Musk. It’s unclear if this was meant to signal something larger, but it was his first direct show of support for the markets since the recent downturn. When asked about a possible U.S. recession, Trump responded, “I would hate to predict something like that.” He added, “It will be great,” while also acknowledging there could be “short-term pain.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Authorities are assessing whether the platform falls under the Markets in Cryptoassets (MiCA) regulations and whether penalties should be imposed. The scrutiny follows a broader discussion among national watchdogs about the oversight of crypto exchanges under the new EU framework. ByBit Hack: EU Considers Sanctions on OKX Over Stolen Crypto Laundering According to a Bloomberg report , hackers laundered $100 million in crypto from the ByBit hack through OKX’s Web3 service. The stolen assets were primarily Ethereum (ETH) and were moved through decentralized platforms and cross-chain bridges. The incident is considered one of the most sophisticated cyberattacks on the crypto industry. EU regulators are debating whether the top crypto exchange’s Web3 platform should be classified under MiCA rules. Some authorities argue that its integration with OKX’s main platform makes it subject to regulatory oversight. Others contend that fully decentralized platforms are exempt from MiCA, complicating the decision on penalties. Crypto regulations have been a big discussion, with ongoing debates about their impact on innovation. Most recently, Acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda announced plans to reconsider a proposed rule that could have classified DeFi exchanges as regulated entities. Uyeda directed SEC staff to explore abandoning the Regulation ATS expansion, citing industry concerns over excessive compliance burdens. Regulators Discuss Potential MiCA Violations and Penalties At a meeting on March 6, regulators from the EU’s 27 member states reviewed the case under the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). Watchdogs from Austria and Croatia stated that OKX’s Web3 platform should fall under MiCA rules due to its connection to the main exchange website. Under MiCA’s Article 64, a license can be revoked if an entity fails to prevent money laundering or violates financial rules. European regulators, including ESMA and the European Banking Authority (EBA), are pushing for an investigation into whether OKX remains compliant with its MiCA license. Malta May Revoke OKX’s MiCA Permit More so, the top crypto exchange secured a MiCA pre-authorization in January through its European hub in Malta. The exchange later obtained permission to operate across the European Economic Area (EEA). However, Malta’s financial regulator is now reviewing whether to withdraw the permit due to the ByBit hack. During the EU discussions, Malta’s representatives indicated plans to meet with OKX executives to address the situation. Authorities may impose sanctions or revoke OKX’s license if found in breach of MiCA regulations.

This article delves into the promising outlook of SUI , MANTRA , and Hyperliquid , offering valuable insights to help investors pinpoint future opportunities. Curious which coins could rise amid the chaos? Discover the hidden gems inside. Sui Price Dynamics: Past Recovery and Current Dips Sui experienced a steep decline in the last month with prices down nearly 29%. This follows a robust rebound over the past six months, during which prices surged by around 133.53%. The recent dip reflects short-term downward pressure against earlier gains that have paved the way for long-term recovery. Price movements indicate notable volatility aligned with performance figures and overall market sentiment. The current price is trading between $2.11 and $3.83, establishing a support level near $1.40 and resistance at approximately $4.83, with an additional resistance around $6.56. Bears hold a slight edge, as momentum indicators appear in the red. However, the oversold RSI hints at potential buying interest within these trading ranges. MANTRA Price Overview: Past Momentum and Key Trading Levels Over the last month, MANTRA experienced an 8.60% price increase while showing an impressive 494.95% gain over the past six months. The recent week saw an 11.16% drop in price, reflecting the coin's volatility. These figures highlight significant upward movement over six months with a short-term pullback that may offer opportunities for entry or exit decisions. The coin currently trades between $4.90 and $9.68. Key resistance is noted at $11.81, with a potential second resistance at $16.58, while support stands at $2.26. Indicators such as a negative Awesome Oscillator and momentum, along with an RSI at 42.85, suggest a lack of clear bullish control. Trading ideas may include watching for a bounce off the support level and seeking a move towards resistance, while caution is warranted until a clear trend forms. Hyperliquid Price Action: Short-Term Slump, Long-Term Recovery Hyperliquid faced a significant weekly decline of about 21% and a one-month drop approaching 40%. In contrast, the coin experienced a strong six-month gain of roughly 42%. This performance highlights short-term volatility and weakness balanced by a more robust long-term recovery, reflecting changing market sentiment. The current price fluctuates between $15 and $26, with strong support at $10.41 and resistance around $33.23. Bearish pressure is evident from technical signals like a low RSI near 29 and negative momentum readings. The lack of a clear trend indicates that traders may seek bounce-backs near support levels or consider shorting opportunities as prices move towards resistance. Conclusion During tough market phases, focusing on strong projects can be beneficial. SUI , MANTRA (OM) , and Hyperliquid (HYPE) each offer unique characteristics. SUI aims for simplicity and ease of use. MANTRA (OM) provides community-driven governance. Hyperliquid (HYPE) focuses on liquidity solutions. Exploring these options may offer some stability and potential during challenging times in the crypto market. Consider each coin's strengths and utility to make informed decisions.

His analysis revealed that XRP is set to face major resistance at $2.9, although he is confident that the crypto will eventually break this resistance and rally to as high as $20. XRP Price Faces Resistance At $2.9 But Could Still Rally To $20 In a TradingView post, ElmoX outlined two scenarios for the XRP price as it eyes a rally to $20, although he noted that the crypto will retest the major resistance at around $2.92 either way, on its way to a new all-time high (ATH). For the first scenario, the analyst stated that XRP would break this resistance and then skyrocket to $20. Related Reading: XRP Price Can Fall Further To $1.5 If This Level Fails To Hold Meanwhile, in the second scenario, ElmoX stated that the XRP price could face another rejection, sending it below the $1.5 level before it witnesses a bullish reversal and rallies to a new ATH. The analyst revealed that he is betting on this second scenario since there is usually a swift crash before an impulsive move to the upside. ElmoX remarked that the XRP price has barely corrected, which is also why he believes there could still be a massive crash before a rally to a new ATH. Meanwhile, the analyst didn’t provide an exact timing for the potential price correction and subsequent rally to a new ATH and the $20 price target. Instead, he simply told market participants to be patient. He further warned that the XRP price might sit in price discovery until at least mid-July. His accompanying chart showed that XRP will first drop to as low as $1.20 before it witnesses an impulsive move to as high as $20. The Altcoin Records A Bullish Close In an X post, crypto analyst CasiTrades noted that although the XRP price briefly broke below the $2 trendline, the candle closed back above this trendline, reclaiming the consolidation range. She remarked that this is exactly what bulls needed to see. However, the analyst added that a confirmation is needed with XRP holding the range between $2 and $2.03 as support. Related Reading: XRP Price Continuation After Crash Below $2.4? New Targets Emerge CasiTrades stated that a breakdown from consolidation usually leads to further downsides, but the XRP price managed to recover the level quickly, showing that buyers are stepping in. She also noted that the bullish divergence is still holding up to the 1-hour RSI even after the dip with selling pressure weakening, which suggests a shift in momentum is possible. If the XRP price holds the support between $2 and $2.03, CasiTrades predicts that the crypto could bounce and rally toward $2.25 and $2.70. On the other hand, if XRP loses this level, she stated that the next major support sits at $1.90 which is the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level. Meanwhile, there is also the possibility that XRP could drop to the 0.618 Fib retracement level at $1.54. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.10, down over 4% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Gox Creditor Frenzy,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/mt-gox-bitcoin-transfer-shock/,"Hold onto your hats, crypto enthusiasts! Just when you thought the Mt. Gox saga was a relic of the past, a seismic event has shaken the digital asset landscape. A colossal 11,502 Bitcoin (BTC) , valued at a staggering $905 million, has just been moved from an address linked to the infamous Mt. Gox exchange to an unknown destination. This sudden, massive Bitcoin transfer has sent ripples of speculation and excitement throughout the crypto community. What does this mean? Is this finally the distribution to creditors everyone has been waiting for? Let’s dive into the details of this developing story. Unpacking the Mysterious Mt. Gox Bitcoin Transfer For those unfamiliar, Mt. Gox is a name that sends shivers down the spines of long-time crypto veterans. Once the dominant force in the Bitcoin exchange world, handling over 70% of all BTC transactions, it spectacularly imploded in 2014. A devastating hack led to the loss of hundreds of thousands of Bitcoins, plunging the exchange into bankruptcy and leaving countless users in financial ruin. The aftermath has been a decade-long legal and financial quagmire, with creditors patiently (or impatiently!) awaiting the resolution and return of their funds. Now, fast forward to today. According to data from Arkham Intelligence, a significant Bitcoin transfer occurred from a wallet associated with Mt. Gox . Let’s break down what we know: Amount Transferred: 11,502 BTC Value at Transfer Time: Approximately $905 million Source Address: Linked to Mt. Gox (as identified by Arkham) Destination Address: Unknown, sparking intense speculation Time of Transfer: Roughly 17 minutes prior to the initial report This isn’t just pocket change; this is a monumental sum of Bitcoin moving after years of dormancy. The crypto community is buzzing with theories, ranging from routine wallet restructuring to the long-awaited creditor payouts finally commencing. Why is this Mt. Gox Bitcoin Transfer a Big Deal? To understand the magnitude of this crypto news , we need to appreciate the long and painful history of Mt. Gox. Here’s why this BTC transfer is sending shockwaves: Creditor Payout Anticipation: For years, Mt. Gox creditors have been in a state of limbo, awaiting compensation for their lost Bitcoin. Any movement of BTC from Mt. Gox wallets is immediately interpreted as a potential sign of progress towards these payouts. Market Impact: The sheer volume of Bitcoin involved is substantial. If these coins were to suddenly enter the market, it could exert significant downward pressure on Bitcoin prices, at least in the short term. Traders and investors are keenly watching to see where these funds are headed and what might be the next step. End of an Era (Potentially): The resolution of the Mt. Gox situation would mark a significant milestone in the history of cryptocurrency . It could signal the closing of a dark chapter and offer a sense of closure for those affected by the exchange’s collapse. Let’s consider the potential scenarios that could unfold following this massive Bitcoin transfer : Scenario Likelihood Potential Impact Creditor Payout Distribution High Positive for creditors, potential short-term market volatility if sold quickly. Long-term positive sentiment as it resolves a major uncertainty. Internal Wallet Restructuring Medium Minimal direct market impact. Could be a preparatory step for payouts or other internal operations. OTC (Over-the-Counter) Sale Low Limited market impact if sold OTC. Could be a way to distribute funds without causing price drops. Further Cold Storage Low Minimal immediate impact. Delays resolution and payouts further. Less likely given the transfer to an unknown address. What’s Next for Mt. Gox and Bitcoin? The destination of this Bitcoin transfer remains shrouded in mystery. The unknown address offers no immediate clues, leaving the crypto community to speculate. However, the timing and source strongly suggest that this movement is related to the ongoing Mt. Gox bankruptcy proceedings and the anticipated creditor repayments. Actionable Insights for Crypto Holders: Stay Informed: Monitor crypto news outlets and social media for further updates on this Mt. Gox Bitcoin transfer . Arkham Intelligence and other blockchain analytics platforms will likely provide more details as they emerge. Manage Market Expectations: Be prepared for potential market fluctuations. While the long-term implications of creditor payouts are generally positive, short-term volatility is possible, especially if there are large sell-offs. Creditors, Stay Patient (and Vigilant): If you are a Mt. Gox creditor, this news is potentially encouraging. However, official announcements from the trustee are the definitive source of information. Be wary of scams and misinformation. A Glimmer of Hope in the Mt. Gox Saga? This sudden Bitcoin transfer from Mt. Gox is more than just a transaction; it’s a symbol of potential progress in a long and arduous saga. While uncertainty remains about the exact purpose of this transfer and the timeline for creditor payouts, it injects a much-needed dose of hope into a situation that has often felt hopeless. The crypto world will be watching with bated breath to see what the next chapter holds for Mt. Gox and its long-suffering creditors.

As congressional momentum rises toward support for crypto legislation in this session, representatives of the traditional financial system are putting its foot on the scales to help tip the balance toward stablecoin regulations. At the House Financial Services Committee hearing on Tuesday, lawyer Randy Guynn argued that the safeguards imposed by the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy Act, known as the STABLE Act, should put issuers of these digital tokens under similar protections to banking. ""If a permitted stablecoin issuer has a properly calibrated reserve of liquid assets, capital buffer and no material amount of liabilities other than its stablecoin liabilities, as contemplated by the STABLE Act, its payment stablecoins should be as safe as insured bank deposits and central bank money,"" according to the testimony of Guynn , who has long been among the most prominent Wall Street lawyers on banking compliance. And just down the witness table from him sat Caroline Butler , the global head of digital assets for BNY Mellon, which Representative Ritchie Torres, a New York Democrat, called the ""ultimate expression of the traditional financial system."" Butler said her bank is already offering significant services for issuers such as Circle ( USDC ) and that the sector needs clarity from the U.S. government. ""What's very important for the ecosystem is to make sure that with banks that are providing custody, there is implicit trust and confidence in the ecosystem that client assets are indeed protected and protected according to federal legislation and regulation,"" she told the House lawmakers. ""We want to be able to participate in the new and evolving options and mechanisms — stablecoins and blockchain technology just being an example of that — so that we can continue to meet the evolving needs of the market and our clients,"" Butler said. The sentiments from proponents of stablecoin regulations echoed what's been said often in the past, but the sources of that sentiment are more often coming from more traditional corners of finance. The confluence has been happening as the political muscle of the crypto industry — fueled by tens of millions of dollars in help provided to congressional campaigns from crypto sources — has strengthened markedly in Washington, as seen in a recent Senate vote in which a crowd of Democrats joined Republicans to overturn an Internal Revenue Service crypto rule. (The House is expected to vote later Tuesday on whether to join the Senate in that.) So, crypto has more friends to make legislation more likely, and Wall Street is there for it. The committee's ranking Democrat, Maxine Waters, and others from her party urged the stablecoin debate to return to a bill that she and former Republican panel Chairman Patrick McHenry had worked out together across the aisle. Rejecting this current effort, she argued a ""need to go back to the drawing board on stablecoins."" But Representative Sam Liccardo, a California Democrat, noted the transition in Congress, abandoning resistance to acting in some manner on stablecoins. ""We've moved from discussing whether to regulate to how to regulate,"" he said. Meanwhile in the Senate, Sen. Bill Hagerty's similar stablecoin legislation called the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act) has been further revised and is heading toward a markup hearing later this week in the Senate Banking Committee. While still haggling over the approach to stablecoins, the committee also looked Tuesday at legislation banning the creation of a U.S. central bank digital currency (CBDCs). Republicans have run a vigorous campaign against the idea and are looking to further cement President Donald Trump's executive order to head off the formation of such a digital dollar. The consideration of a U.S. CBDC never reached significant progress in the previous administration, but GOP lawmakers have suggested that the federal government would use it as a tool to spy on citizens, despite comments from officials such as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell that his agency had no interest in managing a hypothetical CBDC.",Policy|Stablecoins|Stablecoin legislation|Regulation|House Financial Services Committee|Rep.

According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Tuesday, available positions climbed to 7.74 million from a revised 7.51 million in December. The figure exceeded economists’ median estimate of 7.6 million, demonstrating the US job economy’s resilience. The report, part of the Labor Department’s monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS), also showed that layoffs declined slightly while the number of Americans voluntarily quitting their jobs increased. Federal workforce cuts yet to affect job market Job openings rose across multiple sectors, including real estate, healthcare, manufacturing, and construction. Yet, federal government job postings fell to 135,000 from 138,000 in December, a decline likely coming from the effects of cuts ordered by billionaire Elon Musk, under the authority of US President Donald Trump. The agency, established under President Donald Trump’s administration, has its sights focused on reducing federal employment. But its impact on labor data was not fully “felt” in January’s job market report . Some analysts expect layoffs will appear more profoundly in February’s data, scheduled for release on April 1. “ These January data included only the earliest days of DOGE-inspired layoffs of federal workers ,” commented Carol Weinberg and Mary Chen of High Frequency Economics. “ There is no evidence of federal government layoffs in this report. That does not mean that large-scale job cuts won’t be a major feature of the February report .” Job market holds steady, but fears over job cuts still remain According to labour data, there is a downward trend in job openings over the past three years, but vacancies remain above pre-pandemic averages. The hiring rate was unchanged in January, and the layoffs rate dipped to 1%, the lowest since June, which could mean there’s a limited-hiring, limited-firing balance in the US economy. The so-called “quit rates,” or voluntary resignations , climbed to 2.1%, the highest level since July, taking a slow turn from the steady decline seen since 2022. Still, more recent updates spell signs of a softening labor market, with unemployment claims rising to a nearly three-year high in late February, and the latest jobs report showed the unemployment rate accelerating upwards by 4.1%. The ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers, an info the Fed will be using to make interest rate cut decisions, remained steady at 1.1. It is still above pre-pandemic levels, but the ratio has dropped from its peak of 2-to-1 in 2022, meaning job demand numbers have cooled down in the last three years. Federal reserve maintains cautious stance The latest job market figures could fail to convince the Federal Reserve to cut its benchmark interest rate during its upcoming policy meeting on March 19. The rate, currently set between 4.25% and 4.50%, has remained steady since January. Market expectations for an interest rate cut at the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) next meeting are low, with the CME FedWatch Tool placing the probability at just 3%. At a press conference in Chicago on March 7, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said that recent readings of inflation are still above the 2% Fed goal, even though inflation has generally gone down. “ Many indicators show that the labor market is solid and broadly in balance. If inflation is not at the FOMC’s target level and the job market remains robust, then the FOMC may not be inclined to cut rates ,” Powell remarked. Since September 2024, the central bank has reduced its policy rate by 100 basis points following a prolonged tightening cycle in 2022 and 2023 that saw interest rates rise by 5.25 percentage points to take on inflation risks.

All that’s missing is the legislation. That’s according to Juan Carlos Reyes, the president of the Comisión Nacional de Activos Digitales (CNAD), the agency in charge of regulating cryptocurrencies in El Salvador. “From my perspective, Paraguay seems to have the groundwork laid for supervision, regulation, and taxation regimes. It feels like they’re just waiting for politicians to approve or propose a formal law to move things forward,” Reyes told CoinDesk. On Friday Reyes signed a crypto regulatory agreement with Liliana Elizabeth Alcaraz Recalde, head of Paraguay’s Secretaría de Prevención de Lavado de Dinero o Bienes (SEPRELAD). The agreement aims to facilitate cooperation between the two countries when it comes to crypto, including the detection and control of unlicensed crypto operations in Paraguay and the strengthening of anti-money laundering practices. ""While here, I had the opportunity to attend a presentation by the Director of Taxation, who outlined the country’s proposed strategy and direction for regulating cryptocurrencies once the government provides legislative clarity,” Reyes told CoinDesk. ""We’ve also been engaging with Paraguay’s Financial Investigative Unit for some time, sharing best practices and studying how El Salvador has successfully regulated and supervised this market.” El Salvador has one of the most comprehensive crypto regulatory frameworks in the world, and other countries have reached out to the small Central American nation for guidance. Back in December, Reyes signed a similar agreement with Argentina’s Comisión Nacional de Valores (CNV). “One concern I have about the delay in establishing clear regulations is the potential growth of an informal crypto market. If it’s not addressed soon, it could expand to a scale that becomes difficult, if not impossible, to supervise effectively,” Reyes said about Paraguay. “This reminds me of the unregulated sale of U.S. dollars outside formal retail channels in many countries with their own currencies,” he added. “Independent sellers often provide better rates, but there’s no traceability of the funds or visibility into who’s involved. Without timely regulation, I worry cryptocurrencies could follow a similar trajectory here, growing to a point that’s tough to manage.” SEPRELAD did not respond to a request for comment.",Policy|Paraguay|El Salvador|Cnad,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-11 17:10:02

BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes has ignited a fascinating debate by declaring Bitcoin (BTC) as precisely that – a genuine free market, starkly contrasting with the traditional stock market. Let’s delve into Hayes’ compelling argument and explore why this distinction matters, especially for those navigating the volatile world of cryptocurrency and traditional finance. Bitcoin: The Uncensored Free Market Arthur Hayes, a prominent voice in the crypto sphere and co-founder of the crypto exchange BitMEX, took to X (formerly Twitter) to articulate his views. His core argument? Bitcoin operates in a realm of unrestricted freedom unlike anything seen in the world of stocks . Here’s a breakdown of his key points: 24/7 Trading: Unlike the stock market, which adheres to limited trading hours, Bitcoin never sleeps. It trades continuously, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, across the globe. This always-on accessibility ensures that the market is constantly reacting to global events and investor sentiment, without artificial time constraints. Universal Accessibility: The barrier to entry for Bitcoin trading is remarkably low. Anyone with an internet connection can participate in the Bitcoin market. This inclusivity contrasts sharply with the stock market, which often involves brokers, geographical restrictions, and regulatory hurdles that can limit participation for many. Liquidation Reality: In the Bitcoin market, failure has immediate and tangible consequences. If a trader’s position moves against them and they lack sufficient margin, they face liquidation. This mechanism acts as a natural risk management tool, fostering responsibility and discouraging reckless behavior. Crucially, there are no bailouts in Bitcoin. Decentralized and Independent: Perhaps the most significant aspect of Bitcoin’s free market nature is its independence from government intervention. Its price discovery is purely market-driven, free from the influence of central banks or political maneuvering. This decentralization is at the heart of its appeal as a true free market asset. Stocks: A Market Propped Up by Bailouts? Hayes paints a contrasting picture of the stock market, arguing that it deviates significantly from the principles of a free market . He highlights several key differences: Limited Trading Hours: Stock market trading is confined to specific hours, typically during traditional business days. This creates artificial pauses in price discovery and can lead to pent-up volatility that erupts at market open. Investor Restrictions: Access to certain aspects of the stock market, particularly sophisticated investment opportunities, can be restricted to accredited or institutional investors. This inherently limits participation and can skew market dynamics. Bailout Culture: Hayes points to the recurring phenomenon of government bailouts in the stock market, especially for politically connected entities deemed “too big to fail.” This intervention distorts the free market, shielding failing institutions from the natural consequences of their actions and creating moral hazard. Government Dependency: The health of the U.S. stock market is deeply intertwined with government revenue, primarily through capital gains taxes. This creates a vested interest for governments to intervene and prop up the stock market during downturns, further distorting its free market nature. Why Does This Free Market Distinction Matter? Understanding the difference between Bitcoin as a free market and the more regulated, and arguably less free, stock market has profound implications for investors and the broader financial landscape. Here’s why it’s crucial to grasp this distinction: Price Discovery and Transparency In a free market like Bitcoin, price discovery is arguably more transparent and organic. The continuous trading and global participation mean that prices reflect a truly global consensus of value, driven by supply and demand without the dampening or artificial inflation that can occur in markets subject to interventions. This transparency can be particularly appealing in a world where trust in traditional financial institutions is waning. Risk and Reward in a True Free Market The absence of bailouts in the Bitcoin market is a double-edged sword. While it means greater risk – the possibility of swift and decisive liquidation – it also implies potentially greater reward. The market is arguably more efficient in allocating capital to projects and assets that demonstrate real value and utility, as opposed to those that are simply politically favored. This creates a dynamic environment ripe with opportunities, but also demanding a high degree of vigilance and understanding of risk management. Bitcoin as a Leading Indicator? Hayes makes a provocative prediction: in a fiat liquidity crisis, Bitcoin will lead the movements of the stock market, both upwards and downwards. This suggests that Bitcoin, as a purer expression of market sentiment, could act as a leading indicator for broader economic trends. If true, this would make Bitcoin an even more critical asset to watch for those seeking to understand and navigate future market shifts. Is Bitcoin Really a Flawless Free Market? While Hayes presents a compelling case, it’s essential to approach the idea of Bitcoin as a perfect free market with a degree of critical analysis. Here are some nuances to consider: Market Manipulation: While decentralized, the Bitcoin market is not immune to manipulation. “Whales” or large holders of Bitcoin can still exert significant influence on price movements. However, the 24/7 nature and global distribution make sustained manipulation arguably more challenging than in traditional markets. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency is still evolving globally. Future regulations could potentially impact Bitcoin’s free market characteristics, although its decentralized nature makes it inherently resistant to centralized control. Volatility: The very freedom and lack of intervention that define Bitcoin’s free market also contribute to its notorious volatility. While offering opportunities for high returns, this volatility also presents significant risks, especially for inexperienced investors. Embracing the Free Market Reality of Bitcoin Arthur Hayes’ perspective offers a valuable lens through which to view Bitcoin and the broader financial system. Whether you fully agree with his assessment or not, his arguments highlight the fundamental differences between Bitcoin and traditional assets like stocks . Bitcoin’s free market nature, with its 24/7 trading, global accessibility, and absence of bailouts, presents both unique opportunities and challenges. For investors seeking exposure to a truly decentralized and market-driven asset, Bitcoin remains a compelling – and undeniably bold – option.

The stock market correction pushed the index to its lowest level in six months as investors priced in higher odds of a global economic downturn. Despite Bitcoin's 30% drop from its all-time high of $109,350, four key indicators suggest that the correction may be over. Bitcoin bear market needs 40% drop, strong USD Some analysts argue that Bitcoin has entered a bear market. However, the current price action differs significantly from the November 2021 crash, which started with a 41% drop from $69,000 to $40,560 in just 60 days.

Source: TradingView / Cointelegraph The current correction mirrors the 31.5% drop from $71,940 on June 7, 2024, to $49,220 over 60 days. Additionally, during the late 2021 bear market, the US dollar was strengthening against a basket of foreign currencies, as reflected in the DXY index, which surged from 92.4 in September 2021 to 96.0 by December 2021. DXY (left, blue) vs. BTC/USD (right). Nov. 2021 vs. Feb. 2025. Source: TradingView / Cointelegraph This time, however, the DXY started 2025 at 109.2 and has since declined to 104. Traders argue that Bitcoin maintains an inverse correlation with the DXY index, as it is primarily viewed as a risk-on asset rather than a safe-haven hedge against dollar weakness. Overall, current market conditions show no signs of investors moving to cash positions, which supports Bitcoin’s price. BTC derivatives healthy as investors fear AI bubble The Bitcoin derivatives market remains stable, as the current annualized premium on futures stands at 4.5%, despite a 19% price drop between March 2 and 11. For comparison, on June 18, 2022, this indicator fell below 0% after a sharp 44% decline from $31,350 to $17,585 in just 12 days. Bitcoin 2-month futures annualized premium.

Investor sentiment, especially in the artificial intelligence sector, has turned bearish amid growing recession fears. Related: Bitcoin $70K retracement part of ‘macro correction’ in bull market — Analysts Traders are concerned about a potential US government shutdown on March 15, as lawmakers must pass a bill to raise the debt ceiling. However, according to Yahoo Finance, the Republican party remains divided. The key points of contention in House Speaker Mike Johnson’s proposal are increased spending on defense and immigration. Risk-on markets, including Bitcoin, are likely to react positively if an agreement is reached. Real estate crisis is not necessarily negative Early signs of a real estate crisis could accelerate capital outflows into other scarce assets. According to Feb. 27 data from the US National Association of Realtors, home contract signings fell to an all-time low in January. Additionally, a Feb. 23 opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal revealed that over 7% of Federal Housing Administration-insured loans are at least 90 days past due, surpassing the peak of the 2008 subprime crisis. In essence, Bitcoin's path to reclaiming $90,000 is supported by a weaker US dollar, historical evidence that a 30% price correction does not signal a bear market, resilience in BTC derivatives markets , contagion from government shutdown risks, and early signs of a real estate crisis.

Accused of brazenly embezzling disaster relief funds, this official allegedly diverted the money into the volatile world of cryptocurrency investments . Let’s delve into the details of this developing scandal that has rocked Cheongju and raised eyebrows across South Korea. What Exactly Happened? Unpacking the Crypto Embezzlement Scandal According to reports from Channel A, the Board of Audit and Inspection uncovered a disturbing case of government corruption . A local official in Cheongju allegedly misused their position and access to public funds for personal enrichment. The method? A clandestine operation involving the mayor’s official seal and a city-named bank account. Unauthorized Account: The official allegedly used the mayor’s seal without permission to create an account under the city’s name. Massive Embezzlement: Over 45 separate transactions, approximately 497.16 million won (around $341,000 USD) was illicitly transferred between September 2018 and June of last year. Crypto Investments and Debt: The ill-gotten gains were reportedly channeled into high-risk cryptocurrency investments and used to settle personal debts. Legal Repercussions: The official was indicted last year, and the trial is currently underway, promising a potentially lengthy legal battle. This case is not just about financial mismanagement; it’s a stark example of abuse of power and a potential breach of public trust. It raises critical questions about oversight and accountability within local government, particularly when it comes to handling public funds and the allure of quick profits in the cryptocurrency market. The Lure of Crypto: Why Relief Funds Became Investment Capital? Why would someone in a position of responsibility risk everything to invest embezzled funds in cryptocurrencies? The answer likely lies in the volatile yet potentially lucrative nature of the crypto market. Here’s a breakdown of possible motivations: Motivation Explanation High-Risk, High-Reward Mentality Cryptocurrencies are known for their extreme price fluctuations. The official may have been seduced by the possibility of quick and substantial returns, believing they could multiply the embezzled relief funds rapidly. Personal Debt Pressure Reports suggest some funds were used to cover personal debts. The official might have seen cryptocurrency investments as a desperate gamble to escape financial hardship. Lack of Oversight The fact that this embezzlement went undetected for a period suggests potential weaknesses in the internal controls and auditing processes of the Cheongju local government. This lack of immediate oversight might have emboldened the official. Speculative Fever The period from 2018 to mid-2022 witnessed significant hype and bull runs in the cryptocurrency market. The official might have been caught up in this speculative frenzy, believing in the long-term upward trajectory of crypto assets. However, as many have learned the hard way, the cryptocurrency market is as risky as it is rewarding. The promise of quick riches can quickly turn into financial ruin, especially when dealing with misappropriated funds. South Korean Official in Hot Water: What are the Implications? This South Korean official ‘s case has broader implications beyond just individual wrongdoing. It touches upon several key areas: Erosion of Public Trust: Such incidents severely damage public trust in government officials and institutions. When those entrusted with public funds betray that trust, it can lead to widespread cynicism and disillusionment. Need for Stronger Internal Controls: The case highlights the urgent need for robust internal control mechanisms within government bodies to prevent and detect financial irregularities. This includes stricter auditing, multi-signature authorization for accounts, and regular oversight. Increased Scrutiny of Crypto Investments: While not inherently negative, this case may fuel further skepticism towards cryptocurrency investments , particularly within traditional financial and governmental circles. It might reinforce calls for tighter regulation of the crypto market. Impact on Disaster Relief Efforts: The embezzlement of relief funds is particularly egregious as these funds are intended to support communities in times of crisis. Diverting them for personal gain undermines crucial support systems and can have devastating consequences for those in need. Relief Funds Scandal: A Wake-Up Call for Governance and Crypto Oversight The relief funds scandal in Cheongju serves as a stark reminder of the potential for corruption, even at the local level of government. It’s a wake-up call for authorities to strengthen financial oversight and accountability. Here are some actionable insights that can be gleaned from this unfortunate situation: 강화된 감사 시스템 (Ganghwadoen 감사 seuseutem – Strengthened Audit Systems): Implement more rigorous and frequent audits of government accounts, especially those handling public funds. 다중 서명 승인 (Dajung seomyeong seungin – Multi-Signature Approval): Require multi-signature authorization for financial transactions, particularly for high-value transfers, to prevent unilateral actions. 투명성 강화 (Tumyeongseong ganghwa – Enhanced Transparency): Increase transparency in government financial operations, making records more accessible and auditable. 공무원 교육 강화 (Gongmuwon gyoyuk ganghwa – Strengthened Civil Servant Education): Provide comprehensive ethical training and financial management education for government officials, emphasizing the responsibilities and consequences of misusing public funds. 암호화폐 투자 리스크 교육 (Amhohwahoe tuja riseukeu gyoyuk – Cryptocurrency Investment Risk Education): Educate government employees about the risks associated with cryptocurrency investments and the ethical implications of using public funds for speculative ventures. Ultimately, preventing future incidents of crypto embezzlement and government corruption requires a multi-faceted approach that combines robust systems, ethical governance, and a culture of accountability. This case in South Korea is a painful lesson, but one that can pave the way for stronger safeguards and a more trustworthy public sector. In conclusion, the case of the South Korean official charged with embezzling relief funds for cryptocurrency investments is a sobering tale of misplaced trust and the seductive allure of quick wealth. It underscores the critical need for vigilance, robust financial controls, and a renewed commitment to ethical conduct within government. As the trial unfolds, the world watches, hoping for justice and a stronger, more accountable public service in its wake.

With analysts speculating that BTC could finally reach the $200,000 milestone, interest in altcoins like Solana (SOL) and emerging players such as BinoFi (BINO) has risen sharply. While Bitcoin often sets the tone, Solana and BinoFi are carving their paths with unique opportunities, making them key assets to watch in this scenario. Solana (SOL): Proven Innovation in a Maturing Market Solana has been one of the standout performers over the last few years, emerging as a leader in providing high-speed, low-cost blockchain solutions. Known for its blazing-fast transaction speeds and scalability, Solana has positioned itself as one of the strongest competitors to Ethereum, especially within the realms of decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, and NFTs. If Bitcoin does indeed surge to $200K, Solana is likely to ride the wave due to its established reputation and growing adoption. Investors tend to flock to proven altcoins during bullish Bitcoin cycles, especially those with active developer ecosystems and growing utility. The question for Solana is how much higher it can go. Historically, during Bitcoin’s bull runs, top altcoins have experienced outsized gains compared to Bitcoin itself. If Bitcoin doubles its price to reach $200K, Solana could potentially see triple-digit percentage growth. With market dynamics in its favor, some experts suggest SOL could retest or even surpass its previous all-time high. BinoFi (BINO): An Undervalued Opportunity with Explosive Potential While established tokens like Solana are excellent for steady growth, newer projects such as BinoFi (BINO) offer a different kind of potential. At just $0.02 per token, BinoFi is a hidden gem in the cryptocurrency market, but one that’s beginning to garner attention due to its advanced technology and ambitious roadmap. BinoFi’s standout appeal lies in its hybrid approach to liquidity. It combines the best of both centralized and decentralized trading, offering users a streamlined experience without compromising on security or control. This makes it a strong choice for traders who are tired of choosing between accessibility and regulation-free decentralized platforms. One of the most exciting aspects of BinoFi’s future is its upcoming Minimum Viable Product (MVP) launch. This milestone will provide investors with their first opportunity to interact with BinoFi’s ecosystem, which promises simplified cross-chain trading, gasless transactions, and innovative security. With these features, BinoFi aims to solve real pain points in crypto trading, positioning itself as more than just a speculative asset. What Could BinoFi Achieve if Bitcoin Hits $200K? For tokens like BinoFi, Bitcoin’s price surge has historically acted as a major catalyst. If Bitcoin reaches $200K, the speculative interest in affordable and promising projects like BinoFi would skyrocket. BinoFi (BINO) is making waves in the cryptocurrency presale market, advancing rapidly through its current phase with growing investor enthusiasm. Currently priced at just $0.02 per token, the project has already captured attention thanks to its ambitious roadmap and innovative features. With a listing price set at $0.30, early backers are looking at significant returns of a 1500% surge right out of the gate. What’s fueling the excitement? Experts are pointing to BinoFi’s strong fundamentals and its potential to revolutionize crypto trading through its hybrid liquidity model. Analysts predict that BinoFi could achieve astonishing gains of up to 9900% post-listing as it gains traction and adoption. This translates into a rare opportunity for presale participants to maximize their profits before BinoFi’s value skyrockets. Investors are particularly drawn to its low-risk entry point during the presale compared to its projected listing price and beyond. With the token’s current price sitting at only $0.02 and a listing price of $0.30, it offers a highly attractive proposition for those looking to position themselves early in a high-upside opportunity. For forward-thinking investors, BinoFi represents more than just a speculative play. It’s a chance to become part of an innovative project that could redefine the trading landscape. With the clock ticking on the presale and prices set to soar, the question isn’t whether BinoFi is worth backing, but whether you’ll act fast enough to secure your position. Final Thoughts While Solana offers proven innovation and a stable growth trajectory, BinoFi represents the kind of early-stage opportunity that could provide massive returns for those who recognize its potential before it achieves wider adoption.

Recently, the price experienced a slight dip. However, a potential Binance listing could trigger a surge, with some analysts predicting the price may hit $5 soon. Let’s Uncover reasons why the PI price could hit $5 soon. Pi Network Price: What Could Trigger a Surge to $5? The Pi Network price could experience a significant surge due to two key upcoming events: the potential listing on Binance and the Pi Day announcements on March 14. These developments could serve as crucial catalysts for a price recovery and increased investor interest. The anticipation surrounding a possible listing on Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, is growing. With Pi Network ranking 11th in market capitalization, a listing on Binance would likely boost liquidity and attract more trading activity. A successful Binance listing could also pave the way for additional listings on major exchanges like Coinbase and Upbit, increasing the token’s visibility in the U.S. and South Korean markets. In addition to the Binance listing , Pi Day is expected to bring important updates from the Pi Network development team. These announcements could increase investor confidence and drive renewed enthusiasm for the token. The combination of these events may lead to a favorable shift in market sentiment. Pi Network’s growing real-world adoption is another factor that could contribute to its price rise. Zito Realty LLC recently announced that it would accept Pi as a payment method, signaling potential commercial use cases for the token. As more businesses follow suit, it could help bolster demand and further legitimize Pi Network. Moreover, if the broader crypto market sees a recovery, particularly with Bitcoin potentially rallying above $100k, the surge could further fuel Pi’s price. The growth of other tokens like Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and others could also have a positive effect. Pi’s status as a U.S.-focused coin could attract attention from American investors, adding to the momentum. As the market anticipates these developments, investors should stay alert for potential bullish catalysts that could significantly impact Pi’s price in the near future. PI Price Shows Bullish Potential Gains The latest PI price is $1.38, a modest increase of 1.5% over the past 24 hours. The current price indicates potential upward movement, holding steady near key support levels. Strong resistance is at the $1.50 mark, which could be a critical point to watch for a breakout. The MACD shows a mild bullish crossover, signaling potential upward momentum. The MACD line is above the signal line, suggesting that buying pressure might continue in the short term. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 35, still within the neutral zone but leaning towards oversold territory. The PI Network price prediction could target the $3.00 mark if momentum continues, followed by resistance around $4.00. The price could surge as high as $5.00, reflecting a 267% potential upside from current levels. If the PI token price fails to hold the current support, it may dip further toward the next key support level, around $1.20. Pi Network Price Chart: TradingView To sum up, The Pi Network price shows bullish potential, with key upcoming events acting as possible catalysts for a surge to $5. If Binance lists the token and Pi Day brings positive updates, investor interest could increase significantly.

The firm said the initiative aims to allow the fund to stake its Ethereum holdings and enhance returns for investors. The 19b-4 form filed with the SEC indicated that Cboe BZX Exchange proposed to “amend the Fidelity Ethereum Fund to permit staking of ether held by the Trust.” Ethereum’s price surged slightly in reaction to the news and reached $1,960. The digital asset is currently exchanging hands at $1,891 at the time of publication, a 6.90% decline in the last 24 hours. Cboe files proposal for staking in Fidelity’s Ethereum ETF ETF News: @Fidelity files rule change with #SEC to allow staking of the underlying $ETH in the Fidelity #Ethereum Fund. https://t.co/RZBUdnXGQE pic.twitter.com/ZtK5c7FyG5 — MartyParty (@martypartymusic) March 11, 2025 The Chicago Board Options Exchange has filed a 19b-4 form with the SEC to allow staking for the Fidelity Investment spot Ethereum Fund. Cboe hopes the initiative will enable the fund to stake its Ethereum holdings so that investors can make more returns. The firm said the staking will enable investors from the Fidelity Ethereum ETF to commit their ETH holdings to support the operations of the blockchain network. The filing noted that the proposed rule change would allow Fidelity’s FETH fund to stake “all or a portion of the Trust’s ether through one or more trusted staking providers” once approved. It also acknowledged that any rewards generated by staking would be “treated as income.” Validators are selected based on the number of tokens they stake in Ethereum’s proof-of-stake system, which helps secure the Fidelity Ethereum fund and process transactions. The initiative will also allow participants to earn rewards in the form of additional tokens for their contribution to the network. The exchange noted that the Fidelity Ethereum Fund would be among the first ETFs in the U.S. to incorporate staking once approved by the regulators. The firm believes that it could offer investors a way to earn staking rewards without managing the technical aspects themselves. Staking was left out of the proposal that saw spot Ethereum ETFs getting approved last July by the SEC. It appeared to help them gain approval and also allowed for firms like BlackRock and Grayscale to offer shares in the ETF that track the price of ETH. 21Shares and Grayscale are among companies seeking to add staking features to their Ethereum ETFs. Bitcoin Suisse believes Ethereum ETFs will outperform Bitcoin ETFs Crypto finance service provider Bitcoin Suisse projected that Ethereum staking exchange-traded funds could outperform Bitcoin ETFs. The company referred to the flip in capital flows in November, which had Ethereum funds outpacing BTC ETFs in daily flows. Ethereum exchange-traded funds saw $332.9 million in daily flows, while Bitcoin ETFs realized $320 million in daily flows. “While Bitcoin ETFs shattered records with $32B in net flows and IBIT now approaching $50B in AUM in just 225 trading days, we project a structural shift of flows into ETH ETFs in the post-election environment.” – Bitcoin Suisse Outlook 2025 Bitcoin Suisse argued that Ethereum’s underperformance was more due to BTC having a head start as an established narrative. The firm also believes that the regulatory blows that surrounded staking yields also contributed to Ethereum’s underperformance. The service provider said that the removal of regulatory bottlenecks could cause ETH ETFs to take off massively. The firm also envisioned that financial giants would launch institutional rollups on Ethereum. The digital asset service provider also projected that the crypto bull market would continue in 2025, with BTC reaching a new all-time high above $180,000. The Swiss crypto investment partner said they were expecting swift approval for ETH staking in ETFs under the new Trump administration. The firm believes that ETH staking ETFs will eventually unlock a 3-4% yield. The crypto service provider also added that the fund will strongly cater to institutional allocators and will be compelling in a declining rate environment. Bitcoin Suisse also projected that staking yields will disproportionately benefit Ethereum and emerge as the primary catalyst for sustained constructive flows into ETH ETFs. On-chain data showed that the third largest ether ETH, Fidelity Ethereum ETF (FETH), has been declining in terms of assets under management as the price of ETH declined.

ADA shows strong fundamental qualities yet its price has remained stagnant at $0.81 while potential investors anticipated it to reach $7. Ecosystem development has been slow and the rising competition has driven investors to alternative investments with faster growth potential. Mutuum Finance serves as an outstanding example of blockchain performers alongside its product MUTM. The presale campaign for the project currently operates in Phase 3 at the lowest price point of $0.02. Investors actively purchase MUTM tokens because the upcoming price rise is projected to reach $0.025 from its current value of $0.02. Mutuum Finance has received $3 million in funding from 5100 holders who participate in the project at 0.06 dollars per coin. This presents a potential 200% return on investment to investors who acquire tokens right now. The experts forecast that Mutuum Finance will experience a 25x price increase which will take it to $1.5 during 2025. Mutuum Finance Presale Accelerates To Phase 3 The third phase of Mutuum Finance presale has started while the platform attracts increasing investor interest. The DeFi solution provided by Mutuum Finance operates as a scalable long-term solution instead of hyper-inflated meme coins. Investor confidence remains high since Phase 3 of the presale has surpassed $3 million total shares and attracted more than 5100 token holders before the following price adjustment. The presale token price has reached $0.02 during Phase 3 of the presale while the launch will bring it to $0.06. Investors who bought in Phase 3 obtained 200% growth from their investment once MUTM launches. Furthermore analysts predict MUTM will reach $1.5 upon listing resulting in almost 25x the original amount. The current cost of MUTM attracts investors to buy during Phase 4 since it will undergo another pricing increase to 0.025. Revolutionizing DeFi Lending with an Advanced Dual-Model System The non-custodial liquidity protocol of Mutuum Finance delivers decentralized lending which grants users absolute control of their assets. Through lending activities users accumulate passive earnings from lenders and borrowers instantly access funds by placing multiple assets above their loan value. The automatic interest rate adjustments of the system optimize capital structure and sustainability for the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance operates a dual-lending framework that delivers exceptional flexibility to users which features Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer . The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system enables smart contracts to regulate lending pools that shift interest rates in harmony with market conditions. Lenders receive dependable income while borrowers get secure financing opportunities through this system. The P2P approach takes out middlemen by enabling direct communication between borrowing parties and lending participants. Any asset with volatility needs this complete decentralized model which provides maximum flexibility to users. Security takes precedence in this ecosystem through combination with open-source smart contracts along with third-party audits to establish complete transparency. The MUTM token holders benefit from both price growth potential and earn passive income while receiving investments through a strategic buyback system that strengthens long-term token value. Mutuum Finance aims to increase accessibility and liquidity by implementing multi-chain expansion which will include EVM and non-EVM blockchain support. $100,000 Giveaway & Community Incentives The $100,000 giveaway conducted by Mutuum Finance aims to give away $10,000 in MUTM tokens to 10 participants as part of its adoption drive. The referral system within Mutuum Finance provides users with rewards for bringing new members into the platform which helps the community to expand while accelerating its growth naturally. Cardano cryptocurrency battles to surpass $7 despite MUTM generating substantial growth of up to 25x. MUTM enters Phase 3 of its presale operation at $0.02 and has received investments surpassing $3 million from more than 5,100 investors. Each share offers two hundred percent Return of Investment (ROI) before its launch at $0.06 which projects to grow beyond $1.5 after listing according to projections.

Even when the market takes a tumble, some big players see it as a golden opportunity. Guess who’s making headlines again? It’s none other than Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest, known for its bold bets and future-forward investment strategies. They’ve just made another significant move in the crypto space, and it involves everyone’s favorite crypto exchange, Coinbase. Let’s dive into the details of this strategic purchase and what it might signal for the future of crypto investments. Why is ARK Invest Buying More Coinbase Shares? In a rather volatile trading session where Coinbase’s stock, COIN, plunged by a significant 17.6%, ARK Invest saw a chance to capitalize. They didn’t just sit on the sidelines; instead, they went shopping! Through two of their popular Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) and ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF), they snapped up a substantial 64,358 Coinbase shares . This purchase is valued at a cool $11.5 million. Think about it – while others might be panicking and selling off, ARK Invest is doubling down. This move speaks volumes about their conviction in Coinbase and the long-term potential of the crypto market. Fund Shares Purchased ARKK 52,753 ARKF 11,605 Total 64,358 Cathie Wood’s Continued Confidence in Coinbase This isn’t ARK Invest’s first rodeo with Coinbase shares . In fact, this recent acquisition is part of a larger trend. Over the past three weeks, ARK has been consistently adding to its Coinbase holdings, bringing their total investment to a whopping $28.2 million. This consistent buying spree clearly indicates Cathie Wood’s unwavering belief in Coinbase, even amidst market fluctuations and price drops. It’s like she’s saying, “Temporary dips? No problem, I’m in it for the long haul!” But why Coinbase? What makes it so attractive to ARK Invest, especially under Cathie Wood’s leadership? Long-Term Vision: ARK Invest is known for its focus on disruptive innovation and long-term growth. They likely see Coinbase as a leader in the evolving crypto landscape with significant growth potential. Strategic Positioning: Coinbase is a major player in the crypto exchange space. Investing in Coinbase allows ARK to gain exposure to the broader crypto market and its anticipated future expansion. Value Investing Approach: Buying during a price dip is a classic value investing strategy. ARK may believe that the recent price drop in COIN stock is an overreaction, presenting a chance to buy at a discounted price. Coinbase: A Cornerstone in ARK’s Portfolio Let’s talk about portfolio prominence. Coinbase isn’t just a minor holding for ARK Invest; it’s a significant piece of their investment puzzle. Currently, Coinbase stands as: Third-largest holding in ARKK , making up a substantial 7.1% of the fund’s total portfolio. Second-largest holding in ARKF , commanding an even larger 7.7% of this fund’s assets. These percentages are not trivial. They underscore just how much conviction ARK Invest has in Coinbase. It’s clear that they view Coinbase as a key driver for the future of fintech and disruptive innovation. Crypto Market Under Pressure: Is it a Buying Opportunity? The broader crypto market has been experiencing some turbulence lately. The same trading session that saw ARK Invest buying Coinbase shares also witnessed significant losses across the board: Bitcoin (BTC) , the king of crypto, tumbled by 7.6%. Other crypto-related stocks also faced heavy selling pressure. This widespread downturn raises a crucial question: Is this market slump a cause for concern, or is it a buying opportunity? For ARK Invest, and potentially for other savvy investors, it seems to be the latter. They are viewing this dip as a chance to accumulate quality assets at lower prices. This perspective aligns with the principle of “buy low, sell high,” a cornerstone of successful investing. Analyzing COIN Stock Performance COIN stock , representing Coinbase, has certainly seen its share of ups and downs. The recent 17.6% drop is a stark reminder of the volatility inherent in the crypto and tech sectors. However, it’s essential to look beyond short-term price fluctuations and consider the bigger picture. Here are a few factors to consider when analyzing COIN stock performance: Market Sentiment: Crypto market sentiment is highly influential on COIN’s price. Overall market optimism or pessimism can drive significant price swings. Coinbase’s Fundamentals: Company performance, user growth, trading volumes, and new product launches are crucial fundamental factors that impact COIN’s long-term value. Regulatory Landscape: Regulatory developments in the crypto space can have a significant impact on Coinbase’s operations and stock price. Competition: The crypto exchange landscape is competitive. Coinbase’s ability to maintain its market share and innovate is vital for its continued success. Despite the volatility, ARK Invest’s continued investment suggests they are bullish on Coinbase’s fundamentals and its ability to navigate the evolving regulatory and competitive environment. Actionable Insights: What Can We Learn from ARK’s Move? So, what can the average crypto investor learn from ARK Invest’s latest move? Here are a few actionable insights: Think Long-Term: Like ARK Invest, consider adopting a long-term investment horizon, especially in volatile markets like crypto. Focus on the future potential rather than short-term price swings. Do Your Due Diligence: Understand the companies you invest in. ARK Invest’s conviction in Coinbase is likely based on in-depth research and understanding of the company and the crypto market. Consider Buying the Dip: Market downturns can present buying opportunities for fundamentally strong assets. If you believe in the long-term prospects of crypto and companies like Coinbase, market dips can be strategic entry points. Diversify Your Portfolio: While ARK Invest has significant holdings in Coinbase, diversification remains a key principle in risk management. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Conclusion: A Bold Bet on Crypto’s Future ARK Invest’s recent purchase of Coinbase shares amidst a crypto market slump is a powerful statement. It underscores their firm belief in Coinbase and the enduring potential of the crypto market . Cathie Wood’s continued confidence, reflected in these strategic investments, offers a compelling perspective: market volatility can be a gateway to opportunity for those with a long-term vision and a savvy investment strategy. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, ARK Invest’s moves will undoubtedly be closely watched by investors around the globe.

Token Unlocks Fuel Fresh Sell-Off Concerns,https://cryptonews.com/news/is-solana-crashing-below-100-token-unlocks-fuel-fresh-sell-off-concerns/,"Solana has tumbled to $124 today, marking a 3% loss as the cryptocurrency market as a whole declines by 4% in the past 24 hours. SOL is now down by 9% in a week and by 38% in the past month, with the alt – the sixth-biggest coin in the market – also down by 16% in a year. The past few weeks have been particularly difficult for Solana, which has not only witnessed a Trump-induced decline in meme token interest, but has also seen a massive unlock of tokens via the FTX estate . Such factors have suppressed demand for SOL, and when combined with difficult market and macroeconomic conditions, it may be several weeks before the coin enjoys a sustained rally. Is Solana Crashing Below $100? Token Unlocks Fuel Fresh Sell-Off Concerns Some observers have been talking down Solana since last year, given its busy unlock schedule for 2025, when around 18 million SOL – currently worth about $2.23 billion – will enter the market. Of course, FTX’s recent and upcoming unlocks don’t necessarily mean that the recipients of its SOL – mostly big asset managers such as Galaxy Digital and Pantera Capital – will sell immediately. But it does raise concerns surrounding the stability of Solana’s price, especially when the wider market has been on a downwards trajectory since the end of January. In fact, Solana is down by 57% since January 19, which is a massive decline for such a major token, with Bitcoin down by ‘only’ 25% since peaking on January 20. As noted above, much of the problem lies with a growing distaste for meme coins, which have increasingly been centered around Solana and its ecosystem in the past year or so. Indeed, Pump.fun’s volume declined by more than 60% in February (and the trend is continuing so far this month ), with investor demand for meme coins shaken by Official Trump (TRUMP) and by the (briefly) Javier Milei-endorsed LIBRA. As such, Solana is arguably waiting to reinvent itself as a legitimately useful layer-one network, with its attraction in this respect undercut by the recent rise of Sonic . It has the full rollout of the long-awaited Firedancer validator client to look forward to, which will improve efficiency and stability. Source: TradingView And if the market in general recovers by the time Firedancer arrives, the Solana price could return $200 by H2. Its chart suggests that it’s close to bottoming out, so if the ongoing tariff situation calms down in the coming weeks, it could recover strongly soon enough. New High-Potential Altcoins Could Bring Strong Rallies Because Solana has struggled in recent weeks, many traders may prefer to turn to alternatives right now, including lower-cap tokens that can often outperform the market. Presale tokens in particular have done very well this year, especially if they’ve been able to raise significant sums and generate enough momentum. One example that has done just this is Solaxy (SOLX) , which has raised over $25.8 million as it prepares to launch Solana’s first-ever layer-two network. Due to launch in the next few weeks, Solaxy will help Solana users and traders avoid failed transactions, outages and congestion, which have been a big problem for the layer-one blockchain in recent years . The SOLX token will be used to pay transaction fees, meaning that as Solaxy adoption grows, demand for SOLX could skyrocket. It will also enable instant bridging between itself and Solana, while compatibility with other chains (such as Ethereum) will be added after its launch. SOLX is currently available at a price of $0.001572, with investors able to join its presale via its official website . Its price will rise every few days until the its sale ends, and the available signs suggest that it could rally hard once it lists. The post Is Solana Crashing Below $100?

Is this a victory for the Canadian crypto community? Table of Contents Who is Mark Carney Carney’s stance on crypto in the past years What does Carney think of crypto now? Trudeau vs. Carney Who is Mark Carney For five years, Carney served as a Governor of the Bank of Canada. On top of this, for seven years, he was the Bank of England Governor. Carney was the first non-British person to occupy this position. He has a solid background in the financial and tech sectors. Carney holds degrees from Harvard and Oxford. He spent over a decade working for Goldman Sachs in various offices around the globe. Carney received nearly 86% of votes in the race for the Liberal Party leadership following Trudeau’s resignation. Trudeau stepped down amidst the economic decline and discontent expressed by various demographics. Carney didn’t participate in Trudeau’s Cabinet; however, he advised Trudeau on the economic rehabilitation that had followed the COVID-19 years. After the victory in the election, Carney ultimately stated Canada would never be a part of the U.S.A. His program is aimed at solving the economic troubles and cutting government spending and taxes for the middle class. Some believe Carney’s victory can be explained by his economic expertise especially needed given that the economic conditions got worse due to the trade war unleashed by Donald Trump. Carney’s stance on crypto in the past years Carney’s victory is hardly good news for the local crypto community. The Prime Minister’s designate has been skeptical towards Bitcoin and has expressed a preference for Central Bank Digital Currencies, thus leaning toward the opposite approach to the one adopted in the U.S. lately. In a 2018 speech Carney gave while serving as the Bank of England Governor, he said that cryptocurrencies are failing both as currency and as a store of value. He compared the characteristics of crypto as a short-term store of value to the lottery. Also, in the speech, Carney was critical of the low capacity of Bitcoin, explaining that 7 transactions per second are not enough to become a competitive means of payment. He attributed the lack of brick-and-mortar merchants accepting Bitcoin to this. In 2021, Carney called CBDCs superior to stablecoins, believing that the public will prefer CBDCs over assets launched by private companies. In general, Carney stresses that most cryptocurrencies have no intrinsic value, but he still believes some of the native tokens and NFTs will persist. Carney says CBDCs will help fight terrorism and economic crime. In contrast to this, Trump banned the development of the U.S. CBDCs for some time. You might also like: Trump is right to ban CBDCs, and other countries will follow | Opinion What does Carney think of crypto now? We don’t know much about Carney’s current stance on crypto; however, considering the past distaste for cryptocurrencies and the current focus on AI, it seems that Canada is not going to become a strong crypto hub anytime soon. Several media outlets cite Carney’s recent remarks on crypto. Allegedly he called Bitcoin not money but a speculative asset damaging financial stability. However, no link to the source was provided. Carney has served as a board of directors member at Stripe, a platform that supported crypto payments between 2022 and 2024. But Carney shouldn’t see it as a somewhat crypto-friendly move. While Carney doesn’t support the idea that cryptocurrencies can be somewhat useful for Canada, he is fond of AI. The future Prime Minister believes AI will be able to maximize efficiency, cut costs, reduce waste, and boost productivity. He particularly names education, healthcare, and construction as spheres that should be improved via AI. More than that, Carney suggests that Canada must become the world’s leader in AI and digital technologies. He calls for multi-trillion investments in AI and the building of data centers. Trudeau vs. Carney Trudeau has been a vocal critic of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. While the U.S. is fighting to stop the debanking of the crypto companies (Operation Choke Point 2.0), Trudeau, in 2022, unleashed a similar policy against political enemies. That year, Canadian emergency law was used to freeze bank accounts of the “Freedom Convoy” protesters and block crypto donations. In January 2024, the federal judge found unconstitutional the invocation of the Emergency Act to freeze bank accounts and block crypto. https://twitter.com/JustinTrudeau/status/1569489034673815552?t=onn4uYnjWPoYr8QM-he9gg&s=19 On top of that, Trudeau took to X to denounce the use of crypto in order to fight inflation, calling it “not responsible leadership.” Trudeau’s resignation gave the Canadian crypto community hope for a more crypto-friendly PM. However, Carney is even harsher on digital assets than his predecessor.

Trump’s “tariff war,” NATO tensions, and rising global bond yields have made buzzwords like “stagflation” and “recession” all too common—FUD is running rampant. But Worldcoin’s troubles go deeper. The token has been in steady decline since mid-December, plunging 80% and surpassing pre-election lows, causing speculators to question its staying power. Is the AI Token Hype Over? While speculators may be quick to dismiss AI, these are the ripple effects of Trump’s “tariff war.” The administration’s push to repatriate manufacturing and secure technological sovereignty means that businesses must rethink everything from chip fabrication to cloud infrastructure. As a result, AI crypto projects have struggled to gain traction, making them an unconvincing hedge against the broader market downturn. AI remains one of the most promising crypto narratives this cycle. WLD Price Analysis: Is Worldcoin Still the Play This Cycle? Worldcoin offers a glimmer of hope as it continues to hold the lower support of a descending wedge that has guided its decline. WLD / USDT 1D chart, falling wedge pattern. Source: TradingView. While the price has bounced, the most recent retest remains inconclusive, with technical indicators signaling hesitation. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has breached the oversold threshold of 30, often a precursor to upside attempts as selling pressure is exhausted. However, the MACD line and signal line remain in close parallel, neither taking the lead—a sign the bulls seem reluctant to rally behind Worldcoin. without buying pressure to fill this gap the decline stands to continue, likely to be rejected by the immediate resistance of the 20SMA. If bullish momentum builds, Worldcoin could climb to retest the pattern’s upper resistance, and a breakout could target $2.47—a potential 200% gain from current levels. This move would face the same hurdle, as well as stiff resistance from the 50SMA, a key barrier in any recovery attempt.

Right now, Bitcoin (BTC) is giving us mixed signals, leaving investors scratching their heads and wondering – what’s next? The latest analysis from CryptoQuant’s Avocado On-Chain highlights this very dilemma: while Bitcoin’s price continues its dance within a downward channel, a peculiar trend is emerging on Coinbase. Let’s dive deep into this fascinating situation and try to decipher what it means for your crypto portfolio. Decoding Bitcoin Price Uncertainty: A Tug-of-War in the Market The overarching narrative for Bitcoin recently has been one of price correction. We’ve seen BTC navigate a downward price channel , a technical pattern that often suggests continued bearish momentum. However, the plot thickens when we bring Coinbase into the picture. Coinbase, being a major exchange particularly popular among US investors, often acts as a bellwether for institutional and retail sentiment in the North American market. And here’s where the intriguing divergence begins: Downward Price Channel: Bitcoin’s price action is still confined within a descending channel, indicating persistent selling pressure and a struggle to break free from bearish control. Rising Coinbase Premium: Despite the overall downward trend, the “Coinbase premium” is showing signs of life. This premium refers to the price difference of Bitcoin on Coinbase compared to other exchanges, particularly those with more global reach like Binance. A positive premium usually suggests stronger buying interest from US investors. Higher Lows on Coinbase Premium: Avocado On-Chain points out that this Coinbase premium isn’t just positive; it’s forming higher lows. This is a technical indicator suggesting that buying pressure on Coinbase is strengthening, even as the broader market remains hesitant. So, what does this mean? Essentially, we’re seeing a divergence in market sentiment. The global crypto market, as reflected in the overall Bitcoin price, is still leaning bearish. But within the US market, or at least on Coinbase, there’s a growing undercurrent of bullishness. This creates a significant price uncertainty , making it difficult to predict Bitcoin’s next major move. The Coinbase Premium Puzzle: Bullish Whisper or False Dawn? The Coinbase premium is a fascinating metric to watch, but it’s crucial to understand its nuances. Why is it considered a potential bullish signal, and could it be misleading? Why a Rising Coinbase Premium Can Be Bullish: US Institutional Demand: Coinbase is a preferred platform for institutional investors in the US due to its regulatory compliance and security. A rising premium can indicate increased buying activity from these larger players, who often drive significant market movements. Retail Accumulation: Coinbase is also popular among retail investors in the US. A higher premium could suggest growing confidence and accumulation among this segment of the market. Leading Indicator: Historically, shifts in the Coinbase premium have sometimes preceded broader market trends. Some analysts believe it can act as an early indicator of changes in overall market sentiment . Reasons for Caution: Is it a False Signal? Localized Phenomenon: The Coinbase premium primarily reflects sentiment within a specific geographic region (US). Global market forces can still override localized bullishness. Arbitrage Opportunities: Large premiums can attract arbitrage traders who seek to profit from price differences across exchanges. This arbitrage activity can, in turn, reduce the premium and potentially dampen any bullish signal. Short-Term Fluctuations: Premiums can be volatile and influenced by short-term market noise rather than genuine long-term shifts in sentiment. It’s essential to look for sustained trends, like the “higher lows” observed by Avocado On-Chain, rather than reacting to isolated spikes. In the current scenario, while the rising Coinbase premium offers a glimmer of hope, it’s not a definitive sign of a bullish reversal. The overall crypto market still faces macroeconomic headwinds, regulatory uncertainties, and lingering effects from previous market events. Therefore, relying solely on the Coinbase premium for trading decisions would be imprudent. Navigating the Uncertainty: Smart Strategies for Crypto Investors So, what’s an investor to do amidst this perplexing market sentiment ? The key takeaway from Avocado On-Chain’s analysis is caution and strategic planning. Reacting impulsively to news headlines, whether positive or negative, can be detrimental in such an uncertain environment. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Actionable Insights for Uncertain Times: Avoid Overleveraging: High leverage trading amplifies both gains and losses. In times of uncertainty, it significantly increases risk. Resist the temptation to over-leverage based on potentially fleeting positive signals like the Coinbase premium. Don’t Panic Sell: Similarly, avoid knee-jerk reactions to negative news or price dips. Panic selling often locks in losses and can be emotionally driven rather than strategically sound. Pre-Plan Your Strategy: Develop a clear investment strategy beforehand. This should include your risk tolerance, investment goals, and entry/exit points. Having a plan in place helps you make rational decisions even when emotions run high. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification across different cryptocurrencies and asset classes can help mitigate risk during volatile periods. Focus on Long-Term Fundamentals: Instead of getting caught up in short-term price swings, focus on the long-term fundamentals of Bitcoin and the broader crypto ecosystem. Are you confident in the technology and its future potential? This long-term perspective can provide valuable context during periods of Bitcoin price uncertainty . Stay Informed, But Filter Noise: Keep abreast of market developments, but be discerning about your information sources. Rely on reputable analysts and avoid being swayed by hype or fear-mongering on social media. The Path Ahead: Will Bitcoin Break Free or Fall Further? The million-dollar question remains: what’s next for Bitcoin? Will the rising Coinbase premium be a precursor to a bullish breakout, or will the prevailing downward channel continue to dictate price action? The truth is, no one can predict the future with certainty, especially in the volatile world of cryptocurrency. The current market scenario is a delicate balance between potential bullish undercurrents and persistent bearish pressures. The coming weeks will be crucial. Keep a close eye on: Bitcoin’s Price Action: Will BTC manage to break out of the downward channel? A sustained break above resistance levels would be a significant bullish signal. Coinbase Premium Trend: Does the premium continue to rise and strengthen, or does it falter? Continued higher lows would reinforce the bullish divergence. Broader Market Sentiment: How do global economic factors and regulatory developments influence the overall crypto market and Bitcoin’s price? For now, the market is in a state of suspense, characterized by heightened price uncertainty . The mixed signals from the Coinbase premium and the downward price channel underscore the need for caution, strategic planning, and a balanced perspective. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or a long-term holder, navigating this period requires patience, discipline, and a healthy dose of skepticism towards both extreme bullish and bearish narratives.

On March 10, the cryptocurrency fell below $80,000 and touched the $76,800 range before climbing back up to $81,000 at the time of writing. According to the latest edition of the Bitfinex Alpha report, the cryptocurrency’s decline to $76,800 triggered massive losses in the market, with investors recording over $950 million in liquidations for both short and long positions. Bitcoin in New Volatile Range Bitfinex said its analysts expected a temporary upside move toward the previous range lows near $90,000 after BTC fell briefly below $80,000 in February. The expectations played out earlier last week, with the leading cryptocurrency reclaiming those levels before consolidating between $85,000 and $92,000 towards the weekend. However, bitcoin’s volatility increased as the Crypto Summit at the White House approached. Bitfinex said this was fueled by speculation around the creation of a U.S. Strategic Crypto Reserve. By the way, around that time, President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing the bitcoin reserve and a digital asset stockpile. When news emerged on March 7, crypto prices rallied across the market. However, the gains were soon erased as investors understood that the order would not result in any immediate new buying of BTC or other cryptocurrencies. This, in addition to one of the largest Bitcoin and Ethereum options expiry event on the same day (up to $3 billion), triggered more short-term fluctuations, leaving investors in losses. Market Stabilization on the Horizon? Regardless of bitcoin’s negative price action, the leading cryptocurrency has been stable relative to altcoins. But market sentiment about the coin remains cautious, and liquidity conditions and macroeconomic uncertainty are playing key roles in the asset’s next move. “The intense whipsaw in price action over the past two weeks has created turbulent market conditions and driven a surge in realized volatility for Bitcoin, particularly across shorter time frames,” the report stated. On the other hand, the Bitcoin options market has reached some of the highest levels of realized volatility in this cycle, surpassing 80% for its one-week and two-week timeframes. This level of realized losses shows that many traders and short-term holders have been forced to exit their positions below their cost basis. This means they have sold their assets at a loss. However, Bitfinex said such mass capitulation events often precede a phase of market stabilization because strong hands start accumulating as weak hands leave the market.

Developers can now tap into the new version of the cross-chain transfer protocol for USDC ( USDC ) transfers that will settle in seconds, Circle said in an announcement . Circle achieves the enhanced CCTP v2 through two key features: Fast Transfer and Hooks. The new fast transfer feature will reduce USDC settlement times from as high as 15 minutes on Ethereum ( ETH ) and layer-2 networks to just seconds. CCTP v2 will offer this capability regardless of the transaction’s source blockchain. Apart from faster-than-finality settlement, v2’s Hooks feature also enhances composability for smart contracts. This means developers can automate post-transfer actions on the chain receiving the USDC transfer. “Traditional cross-chain flows are often riddled with additional trust assumptions, block-finality delays, and liquidity fragmentation,” Jonathan Lim, principal product manager at Circle, said. “CCTP V2 mitigates these issues, and paves the way for improved cross-chain USDC liquidity, enhanced cross-chain UX, and institutional-grade cross-chain infrastructure for crypto capital markets.” You might also like: Ledger integrates Alchemy Pay’s on & off-ramp into Ledger Live The upgrade to CCTP comes a few days after Circle added support for passkeys to its Modular Wallets, which the company said would help unlock a better transaction experience for USDC users. Passkeys allow developers to enable easy user onboarding and offer secure USDC transactions. The key improvement lies in enhanced authentication flows, the firm noted. According to Circle, CCTP v2 will still support the cross-chain transfer speeds for USDC currently available via CCTP v1. This Standard Transfer time allows transactions to settle according to the finality time of the given blockchain. Supported networks and future expansion v2 launches with initial support for the Avalanche, Base, and Ethereum networks. The company plans to expand the features to more chains. Meanwhile, Wormhole, Mayan, Interport, and Socket are among the top apps, bridges, and infrastructure platforms that have already integrated CCTP v2. Circle introduced its cross-chain transfer protocol in April 2023, and it has since gained adoption across the ecosystem. Integration across leading blockchain networks and protocols has contributed to its growth.

To read full editions, subscribe . Wanna be a wizard? Taproot Wizards, a collection of “magic internet jpegs” inspired by the 2013 r/Bitcoin wizard, are holding their first-ever public sale. This sale is happening two years after the Wizards were inscribed onto Bitcoin as Ordinals. Unlike traditional NFTs, Ordinals are pieces of data or art attached directly to satoshis (sats), which are 1/100,000,000th of a bitcoin. 2,085 Wizards will be up for sale through the project’s website starting March 25, with additional honorary Wizards to be inscribed soon and not included in the sale. The honorary Wizards will be given away. Minting a Taproot Wizard will cost hopeful collectors 0.2 BTC (roughly $16,000 at time of writing), though it’s worth noting that there will be discounts for holders of Quantum Cats — another Bitcoin Ordinals collection from the same team. If you own two “entangled” Quantum Cats — one with the “alive” trait and one with the “dead” trait — you can mint a Wizard for 0.1 BTC (about $7,900). The “entangled” mechanic plays off Schrödinger’s Cat, the famous quantum physics thought experiment where a cat inside a box exists within both a living and dead state until observed. The Taproot Wizards price reflects their scarcity — only 2,121 exist, unlike more typical 10,000-piece collections. And yes, the price is steep, especially in this market. But with their cult-like following, I wouldn’t be surprised if they still sell out. “It’s been quite the journey,” Wizards founder Udi Wertheimer said of the past two years since launching the project. The mere existence of Ordinals art on Bitcoin has disgruntled some Bitcoin maximalists, with some calling it blockchain “ vandalism .” Instead, fans had to prove their worth through various bizarre-yet-hilarious displays of commitment. According to Wertheimer, some took it to extremes — showering in full wizard attire, leaping out of helicopters into swimming pools wearing robes and pointy hats, or even braving a car wash with the windows down, robe and all — just to get the team’s attention. Unorthodox? Perhaps. But plenty were willing to embrace the absurdity for a shot at owning a piece of Bitcoin history. “If someone wants a Taproot Wizard bad enough, they’ll find a way,” he said. The Taproot Wizards team, which currently operates with 10 people, is actively hiring. Last month, they raised $30 million in a funding round led by Standard Crypto. They’re advocating for OP_CAT, a proposal that could add more functionality to Bitcoin and would be similar to what Ethereum’s smart contracts offer if passed. Originally created by Satoshi Nakamoto, OP_CAT was disabled in 2010 due to concerns over potential security risks and limited immediate use cases at the time. If reintroduced, it would allow Bitcoin scripts to manipulate and combine pieces of data dynamically, opening the door for more advanced transaction types. Among other possibilities, it could enable covenants (rules restricting how BTC can be spent), improved smart contracts, and more flexible transaction logic. While not as complex as Ethereum’s smart contracts, OP_CAT could expand Bitcoin’s capabilities without compromising its security and decentralization-first ethos. Most Wizards will be sold via the whitelist, and a few will be offered on Dutch auction. Another few are being set aside to be given to users for free, who have proved their interest in and loyalty to the Wizards, like one guy who replied on Twitter asking for a Wizard for 365 days in a row. Why did they wait two years before offering the Wizards for sale? “It proves to everyone that this is a long-lasting thing, it’s not just a bunch of jpegs we’re trying to sell and move on,” Wertheimer said. I do agree with Udi that Bitcoin (and its layer-2s like Stacks and Lightning) have so much potential to become a real hub for art, apps, and other neat crypto use cases besides for payments alone. In my opinion, people won’t likely be buying Taproot Wizards for the Microsoft Paint-esque art. They’ll be buying it for clout, for the community, and to be a part of one of the more famous Ordinals collections. Get the news in your inbox.

41493220,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=691063,1741715184,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/41493220.jpeg,Crypto investors cash in on locked assets through trading loopholes,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/crypto-investors-cash-in-on-locked-assets/,"Crypto investors are cashing in on locked tokens through trading loopholes, using backdoor deals with market-making firms to turn restricted assets into liquid cash, according to a report from Bloomberg today. Many of these tokens are supposed to remain off the market due to vesting schedules, but the report says investors are using over-the-counter (OTC) trades and other secondary market strategies to sidestep restrictions. Venture capitalists and early backers stuck holding tokens they can’t sell for years, have been working with platforms like Wintermute, Flowdesk, and Caladan to move their assets. Joshua Lim, Co-Head of Markets at FalconX, said they are “constructing two-sided books on these tokens that exist outside centralized exchanges” to help investors hedge their positions. Market makers exploit growing demand The secondary market for locked tokens has surged since mid-2023, according to Flowdesk’s Chief Markets Officer David Bachelier. “While it’s not yet a fully functional two-way market, demand suggests significant potential for innovation and growth,” David reportedly told Bloomberg. These trades are happening through many ways. Some investors transfer their token rights through a Safe Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFTs), basically selling the right to receive the tokens once they unlock. Others use forward contracts, making deals to trade tokens at fixed future prices, which allows investors to hedge against price fluctuations, but they’re required to put up collateral to ensure delivery, according to Wintermute’s Global Head of Business Development and Partnerships Jonathan Chan. Bloomberg says some investors are bypassing token project approval altogether, via ways to hedge locked tokens without permission, making this type of trading a sensitive topic in crypto circles. A February report from Tokenomist shows that the five largest token unlocks in 2024 injected $5.4 billion worth of tokens into circulation. When large unlocks happen, holders often rush to cash out, which of course drives prices down, so the market makers are stepping in to ease the pressure. Hedging strategies raises the crypto industry’s concerns Not everyone is on board with the growing secondary market for locked assets. Some token issuers require explicit approval before an investor can transfer token rights. Despite that, the Bloomberg report says some deals are happening without oversight, raising concerns among crypto projects trying to enforce vesting agreements. Will Leung, head of partnerships at Caladan, said these trades are about risk management, not violating agreements. “I think managing the risk around your balance sheet is very important,” he said. Websites like OFFX are also playing a role, brokering OTC and secondary market trades for locked assets. However, OFFX declined to comment on its activities. Meanwhile, the crypto market has been volatile. Bitcoin, which hit a record high of $109,241 in January, has since dropped more than 25%. It has now rebounded to $81,600 at press time, as Ethereum is also dealing with similar turbulence, falling as low as $1,756 before recovering to $1,933. Lim said Bitcoin’s connection to traditional markets is making things worse. “Bitcoin’s correlation to equities is climbing to levels not seen since August 2024’s yen carry trade unwind,” said Lim. Leveraged crypto ETFs also took a hit. Two ETFs linked to Strategy, the largest corporate Bitcoin holder on earth, fell more than 30% in a single day.

The digital currency world is buzzing with activity, and one metric, in particular, is sending ripples through the market: the ETH/BTC ratio. For those unfamiliar, this ratio essentially tracks the value of Ethereum (ETH) relative to Bitcoin (BTC). Recent data from CoinGecko reveals a startling development – the ETH/BTC ratio has tumbled to its lowest point since December 2020. This isn’t just a minor fluctuation; it’s a significant shift that warrants a closer look. Let’s dive into what’s happening and what it could mean for you, whether you’re a seasoned trader or just dipping your toes into the crypto waters. What Exactly is the ETH/BTC Ratio and Why Does it Matter? Before we delve deeper into the current drop, let’s understand what the ETH/BTC ratio represents and why it’s a metric worth monitoring. In simple terms, the ETH/BTC ratio is calculated by dividing the price of Ethereum by the price of Bitcoin. This ratio provides a comparative view of the performance of Ethereum against Bitcoin. It acts as a barometer for the relative strength or weakness of Ethereum in the cryptocurrency market, especially when compared to the dominant cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. Why is this ratio so important? Here’s a breakdown: Altcoin Season Indicator: Many traders use the ETH/BTC ratio as a potential indicator of an ‘altcoin season’. When the ratio is rising, it often suggests that Ethereum and other altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin, signaling a potential shift of capital into the broader altcoin market. Conversely, a declining ratio, like what we’re currently witnessing, can suggest Bitcoin dominance is increasing, and altcoins might be underperforming. Market Sentiment Gauge: The ratio can reflect broader market sentiment. A strong ETH/BTC ratio can indicate confidence in the Ethereum ecosystem, including DeFi, NFTs, and smart contracts. A weakening ratio might suggest concerns or a risk-off sentiment favoring Bitcoin’s perceived safety and established history. Trading Strategies: Traders often use the ETH/BTC ratio to inform their trading strategies. For instance, some traders might increase their ETH holdings when the ratio is trending upwards, anticipating further outperformance. Conversely, a declining ratio might prompt them to reduce ETH exposure in favor of BTC or stablecoins. The Alarming Drop: ETH/BTC Ratio Hits December 2020 Lows Now, let’s focus on the concerning trend. According to CoinGecko data, the ETH/BTC ratio on major centralized exchanges has plummeted to levels not seen since December 2020. On Binance, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, the ratio experienced a significant 8.5% drop, settling at 0.02329 as of March 11th. This decline is even more striking when we consider the broader context: since the beginning of the year, the ETH/BTC ratio has fallen by a substantial 37%. This isn’t a minor dip; it’s a pronounced downward trend that has caught the attention of market analysts and investors alike. To put this into perspective, December 2020 was a pivotal time in the crypto market. It was right before the massive bull run of 2021 truly kicked off. The fact that the ETH/BTC ratio is now back at those levels raises questions about the current market dynamics and the potential future trajectory of both Ethereum and Bitcoin. Decoding the Downturn: What Factors are Driving the ETH/BTC Ratio Decline? Several factors could be contributing to this significant decrease in the ETH/BTC ratio . Let’s explore some of the most prominent possibilities: Bitcoin’s Resurgence and Renewed Dominance: Bitcoin has been demonstrating renewed strength in recent weeks. Positive developments around Bitcoin ETFs, institutional adoption, and its narrative as ‘digital gold’ in times of economic uncertainty may be driving capital back into BTC. This ‘flight to safety’ phenomenon often benefits Bitcoin at the expense of altcoins, including Ethereum, leading to a lower ETH/BTC ratio. Ethereum’s Challenges and Concerns: While Ethereum remains a powerhouse in the crypto space, it’s not without its challenges. Concerns about high gas fees, scalability issues (despite the ongoing upgrades), and increasing competition from other Layer-1 blockchains might be weighing on investor sentiment towards ETH. While the Merge was a significant milestone, the full impact of Ethereum 2.0 is still unfolding, and market patience can be fickle. Macroeconomic Headwinds: The broader macroeconomic environment plays a crucial role in the crypto market. Rising interest rates, inflation concerns, and geopolitical uncertainties can lead to risk aversion. In such environments, investors tend to gravitate towards perceived safer assets like Bitcoin, further contributing to the decline in the ETH/BTC ratio. Shifting Market Narratives: Market narratives are constantly evolving. The initial hype around DeFi and NFTs, which heavily benefited Ethereum, might be cooling off slightly, with new narratives emerging, potentially favoring Bitcoin or other sectors within the crypto space. It’s likely a combination of these factors, rather than a single cause, that is driving the current downward pressure on the ETH/BTC ratio . Impact on Altcoin Season: Is the Party Over? For many altcoin enthusiasts, a rising ETH/BTC ratio is often seen as a precursor to an ‘altcoin season’ – a period where altcoins, in general, experience significant price appreciation, often outperforming Bitcoin. With the ETH/BTC ratio plummeting, the question arises: does this signal the end of, or at least a pause in, the anticipated altcoin season? The answer isn’t a simple yes or no. While a declining ETH/BTC ratio can dampen enthusiasm for altcoins in the short term, it doesn’t necessarily mean the altcoin party is completely over. Here’s a nuanced perspective: Altcoin Season May Be Delayed, Not Cancelled: Market cycles are inherent in crypto. A period of Bitcoin dominance can be followed by a resurgence of altcoins. The current ETH/BTC ratio drop might simply indicate a temporary shift in market focus towards Bitcoin, potentially setting the stage for a renewed altcoin season later. Selective Altcoin Performance: Even during periods of Bitcoin dominance, select altcoins with strong fundamentals, innovative technology, and growing adoption can still outperform. It’s crucial to differentiate between the broader altcoin market and individual projects. ETH Still a Key Player: Despite the ratio decline, Ethereum remains a foundational blockchain with a massive ecosystem. Continued development, layer-2 scaling solutions, and real-world use cases could reignite interest in ETH and potentially reverse the ETH/BTC ratio trend. Navigating the Current Crypto Market: Actionable Insights for Investors So, what should crypto investors do in light of this declining ETH/BTC ratio ? Here are some actionable insights to consider: Reassess Portfolio Allocation: Review your crypto portfolio allocation. If you are heavily weighted towards Ethereum and altcoins, consider rebalancing to include a higher proportion of Bitcoin, especially in the current market climate. Risk management is key. Focus on Fundamentals: In a potentially more selective market, prioritize altcoins with strong fundamentals, solid technology, active development communities, and real-world utility. Avoid hype-driven projects lacking substance. Monitor Market Sentiment: Keep a close eye on market sentiment and broader macroeconomic trends. Factors like inflation data, interest rate decisions, and geopolitical events can significantly impact the crypto market and the ETH/BTC ratio. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Consider using dollar-cost averaging, especially during periods of market uncertainty. Instead of trying to time the market bottom, DCA involves investing a fixed amount at regular intervals, which can help mitigate risk and potentially capitalize on price dips. Stay Informed and Adaptable: The crypto market is dynamic and ever-changing. Stay informed about the latest developments, be prepared to adapt your strategies, and avoid emotional decision-making based on short-term price fluctuations. Conclusion: A Crypto Market Crossroads? The recent drop in the ETH/BTC ratio to its lowest level since December 2020 is undoubtedly a significant development in the cryptocurrency market. It signals a potential shift in market dynamics, with Bitcoin regaining dominance and Ethereum facing renewed scrutiny. While it might temper immediate enthusiasm for an altcoin season, it also presents opportunities for strategic portfolio adjustments and a renewed focus on fundamental analysis. The crypto market is at a crossroads, and understanding these shifts is crucial for navigating the path ahead. By staying informed, adapting strategies, and focusing on long-term value, investors can position themselves to thrive, regardless of short-term market fluctuations and ratio dips.

The company has successfully raised a staggering $200 million through a Series A-1 Preferred Shares financing, as reported by TheMinerMag. This substantial capital infusion is poised to dramatically accelerate Canaan’s expansion plans, particularly in North America. Let’s dive into what this means for Canaan, the Bitcoin mining landscape, and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. What’s Driving Canaan’s $200M Cryptocurrency Financing? The recent announcement details a two-phased financing round, with an initial $100 million already secured on March 10th and another $100 million anticipated imminently. This fresh capital isn’t just sitting idle; it’s strategically earmarked to fuel three critical areas: Research and Development: Innovation is the lifeblood of the tech industry, and Bitcoin mining hardware is no exception.

Production Expansion: Demand for Bitcoin mining hardware fluctuates with market cycles, but strategic expansion requires forward-thinking production capabilities. This funding will enable Canaan to scale up its production lines, ensuring it can meet growing demands and potentially capture a larger market share. This is crucial for timely delivery and responsiveness to market uptrends. North American Digital Mining Infrastructure: Perhaps the most geographically significant aspect is the focus on North America. The funds will be used to build and bolster digital mining infrastructure in the region. This suggests a strategic pivot towards establishing a stronger foothold in North America, potentially driven by factors like favorable energy costs, geopolitical stability, and increasing institutional interest in Bitcoin mining within the continent. This $200 million financing is not an isolated event. It builds upon previous financial maneuvers by Canaan, including Bitcoin-backed loans and equity raises that have collectively amounted to $125 million since late 2023. This consistent access to capital underscores investor confidence in Canaan’s vision and the future prospects of the Bitcoin mining industry. Why Focus on Bitcoin Mining Expansion in North America? North America has emerged as a key region for Bitcoin mining in recent years, and Canaan’s strategic focus here is far from coincidental. Several compelling factors make North America an attractive destination for Bitcoin mining expansion : Energy Resources: Certain regions in North America, particularly in the United States and Canada, boast abundant and relatively inexpensive energy resources, including renewable energy sources like hydroelectric and wind power. Access to cost-effective energy is paramount for profitable Bitcoin mining operations. Geopolitical Stability: Compared to some other regions globally, North America offers a more stable geopolitical environment and regulatory landscape. This reduces risks associated with political instability and sudden regulatory shifts that can significantly impact mining operations. Growing Institutional Adoption: North America is witnessing increasing institutional adoption of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. This growing acceptance translates into a more mature and supportive ecosystem for Bitcoin mining companies. Infrastructure and Technology: North America has well-developed infrastructure and technological capabilities, essential for supporting large-scale digital mining operations. This includes reliable internet connectivity, logistics, and a skilled workforce. By strategically investing in North America mining infrastructure, Canaan is positioning itself to capitalize on these advantages and cater to the growing demand for Bitcoin mining in a key global region.

Speaking at the CERAWeek conference – and energy markets conference run by S&P Global – Fink says markets are currently discounting inflation, and that US industries will likely experience higher costs in the next six to nine months, Reuters reports . Fink suggests that the potential for millions of migrant workers to be deported and the subsequent shrinking of the labor supply could contribute to inflation. “I think if we all are becoming a little more nationalistic – and I’m not saying that’s a bad thing, you know, it does resonate with me – that it’s going to have elevated inflation.” Are we going to have enough workers to harvest this now? I’ve even told members of the Trump team that we’re going to run out of electricians that we need to build out AI data centers. We just don’t have enough.” Commenting on the tariffs, Fink says, “When I go to Washington, when they talk about these policies, at what cost are you willing to tolerate that?” Fink’s comments come after BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world with over $11.6 trillion in total assets, led a consortium to acquire CK Hutchison, a company that operates in over 43 ports across 23 countries, including the Panama Canal. The CEO has previously touted Bitcoin ( BTC ) as a legitimate inflation hedge, and earlier this year at the World Economic Forum (WEF) event in Davos, Switzerland, said the flagship crypto asset could run as high as $700,000 in the event that sovereign wealth funds start allocating. “If you’re frightened of the debasement of your currency or you’re frightened of the economic or political stability of your country, you can have an internationally based instrument called Bitcoin that will overcome those local fears. And so I’m a big believer in the utilization of that as an instrument, and so if that becomes true and you see that it could be a proper hedge against hope securities or equities, the question is, could you see it be a 2% or 5% allocation? I was with a sovereign wealth fund during this week and that was the conversation. Should we have a 2% allocation? Should we have a 5% allocation? If everybody adopted that conversation, it would be $500,000, $600,000, $700,000 per Bitcoin.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The tokens, available to accredited investors, each represent one kilogram of gold stored in custody, according to the press release. Investors can trade these digital assets on ATME’s secondary market or redeem them for physical gold. The initiative aims to modernize gold ownership by eliminating storage and transportation concerns while leveraging blockchain for efficiency and security.

The exchange said it plans to expand its offerings to include other asset classes, further integrating blockchain technology into traditional financial systems. ATME’s tokenized gold offering aligns with a broader trend in financial markets where real-world assets such as commodities, bonds and funds are increasingly being digitized and traded on blockchain rails, a process also known as tokenization. The market of tokenized gold is worth around $1.2 billion, dominated by Paxos-issued PAXG and stablecoin issuer Tether's XAUT tokens, rwa.xyz data shows.

41493949,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=139115,1741716653,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Urgent Forex Alert: Dollar Plunges on Growth Fears, Euro Soars on German Deal",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/dollar-weakens-euro-soars-forex/,"Cryptocurrency markets often react to shifts in traditional finance, and the latest movements in the Forex arena are no exception. Savvy crypto investors keep a close eye on major currency pairs because fluctuations in the dollar and euro, for instance, can signal broader economic trends that ripple through the digital asset space. Right now, the currency markets are flashing a clear signal: the dollar weakens as concerns about global economic growth intensify, while the euro is experiencing a surge of euro strength . Let’s dive into what’s driving these crucial Forex market shifts and what they could mean for your crypto portfolio. Why is the Dollar Weakening Amidst Global Growth Concerns? The US dollar, traditionally seen as a safe-haven asset, is currently under pressure. This dollar weakens scenario is primarily fueled by growing anxiety surrounding the pace of global economic expansion. Several factors are contributing to these global growth concerns : Slowing Economic Data: Recent economic indicators from major economies, including the US, have pointed towards a potential slowdown. Manufacturing activity, consumer spending, and even employment figures are showing signs of cooling off. Inflationary Pressures: Despite efforts to combat inflation, persistent price increases continue to worry investors. Central banks are walking a tightrope, trying to curb inflation without triggering a recession. Geopolitical Uncertainty: Ongoing geopolitical tensions, from Eastern Europe to other regions, add another layer of risk and uncertainty to the global economic outlook. This uncertainty often leads investors to question the strength of economies reliant on global trade and stability. When global growth concerns escalate, investors tend to become risk-averse. However, in this instance, instead of flocking to the dollar as a safe haven, they are seemingly looking elsewhere, contributing to the dollar’s decline. This unusual reaction suggests a deeper unease about the US economic outlook itself, or perhaps an opportunity arising elsewhere, like in the Eurozone. Euro Strength: Riding the Wave of German Defense Deal Hopes While the dollar faces headwinds, the euro is enjoying a period of relative euro strength . This positive momentum for the euro is partly attributed to renewed optimism surrounding a potential German defense deal. But what exactly does a defense deal have to do with currency strength? Economic Boost: Large-scale defense deals, particularly in a major economy like Germany, can inject significant capital into the economy. This includes investments in manufacturing, technology, and job creation, all of which are positive for economic growth prospects. Geopolitical Stability Signal: A strong commitment to defense spending can be interpreted as a sign of stability and resolve in the face of geopolitical challenges. This can boost investor confidence in the Eurozone and its ability to navigate turbulent times. Reduced Perceived Risk: If investors perceive Germany, and by extension the Eurozone, as becoming more secure and economically robust due to such deals, they may be more inclined to invest in euro-denominated assets, thus increasing demand for the currency and driving up its value. The anticipation of this German defense deal is acting as a catalyst, fostering euro strength against the backdrop of a weakening dollar. It’s important to remember that currency movements are complex and influenced by a multitude of factors, but this deal seems to be playing a significant role in the current euro uptrend. Navigating the Forex Markets: What Does This Mean for Crypto? The interconnectedness of global finance means that shifts in Forex markets often have repercussions for the cryptocurrency world. Here’s how the current dollar weakness and euro strength scenario could impact crypto investors: Dollar-Pegged Stablecoins: If the dollar continues to weaken, the purchasing power of dollar-pegged stablecoins like USDT and USDC might slightly decrease relative to other currencies and potentially other assets, including certain cryptocurrencies. Euro-Denominated Crypto Investments: A stronger euro could make euro-denominated crypto investments more attractive for European investors. It might also lead to increased trading activity in EUR/crypto pairs. Broader Market Sentiment: Currency market movements are often seen as a barometer of overall market sentiment. Dollar weakness, linked to global growth concerns , could reflect a broader risk-off sentiment that might also impact cryptocurrency valuations, at least in the short term. Conversely, if the euro strength signals renewed confidence in a major economy, it could contribute to a more positive overall market outlook eventually benefiting crypto as well. Diversification Strategy: Understanding Forex trends can inform diversification strategies within the crypto space. Investors might consider diversifying into cryptocurrencies or stablecoins pegged to currencies other than the US dollar to mitigate risks associated with dollar fluctuations. Actionable Insights: How to Respond to Forex Market Shifts So, what practical steps can crypto investors take in response to these Forex markets dynamics? * **Stay Informed:** Keep a close watch on economic news, particularly indicators related to growth, inflation, and geopolitical developments. Follow Forex market analysis and commentary from reputable sources. * **Reassess Risk Tolerance:** Dollar weakness and global growth concerns can heighten market volatility. Re-evaluate your risk tolerance and adjust your portfolio allocation accordingly. Consider reducing exposure to higher-risk assets if you anticipate further economic uncertainty. * **Explore Diversification:** As mentioned, diversification across different cryptocurrencies and even into assets beyond crypto, can help mitigate risks associated with currency fluctuations and market volatility. Consider exploring cryptocurrencies with different currency pairings or those that are not directly tied to the dollar. * **Consider Hedging Strategies:** For more advanced investors, exploring hedging strategies using Forex markets or inverse ETFs might be an option to protect against potential downside risks arising from dollar weakness or broader economic downturns. However, hedging strategies involve complexities and should be approached with caution and proper understanding. The Road Ahead: Navigating Currency Crosscurrents The current situation in the Forex markets , with the dollar weakens narrative and the contrasting euro strength story, underscores the intricate interplay of economic factors, geopolitical events, and investor sentiment in shaping currency values. For cryptocurrency investors, understanding these dynamics is becoming increasingly crucial. The movements in traditional financial markets, like Forex, offer valuable clues about broader economic trends and risk appetite that can significantly influence the crypto landscape. By staying informed, adapting strategies, and understanding the signals emanating from the Forex world, crypto investors can better navigate the ever-evolving landscape of digital assets and position themselves to capitalize on emerging opportunities, even amidst global economic uncertainties.

With Bitcoin and altcoins falling, many retail investors have panic-sold while others have been liquidated. Still, past experience shows that it is possible to turn $100 into $100K during the ongoing cryptocurrency market crash. Can One Turn $100 Into $100K During the Crypto Market Crash? The crypto market is probably the only area where one can turn $100 into $100K. For example, one Bitcoin in 2010 would be worth $82,000 today. Most recently, $100 invested in Mantra in 2023 would now be worth over $30,000. However, while crypto may generate strong returns over time, it is largely not possible to turn $100 to $100k before April this year. Such a move would imply a 99,900% surge. The ongoing crypto market crash could provide a good entry point for investors seeking big returns. That’s because the ongoing fear is associated with Donald Trump’s tariffs , which many investors see as a black swan event. However, in the past, the stock and crypto market has rebounded after such big events such as during the COVID-19 pandemic and the dot-com bubble. Two potential catalysts for these assets will be the end of tariffs and a potential Federal Reserve pivot now that US bond yields have slipped . On top of that Bitcoin price could benefit from the upcoming Lunar Eclipse . Top Altcoins that Could Surge by April Some of the top crypto coins that could surge by April are Polkadot (DOT), Pepe (PEPE), and Dogecoin (DOGE). Polkadot (DOT) Polkadot is one top altcoin that can help you turn $100 into $100k over time amid the crypto market crash. Its top fundamental catalysts are the upcoming Polkadot 2.0 launch and the potential DOT ETF approval . Polkadot has strong technicals. As the chart below shows, it has failed to crash below the key support at $3.60 during the ongoing crypto market crash. This is a notable level where it formed a quadruple bottom. It is also in the accumulation phase of the Wyckoff Theory, pointing to further gains ahead. The coin has also formed a falling wedge pattern. Therefore, a surge to the neckline at $11.72, would be a near 200% increase from the current level. Also a jump to its all-time high of $56 would be a 1,445% surge from the current level. Polkadot Price Pepe (PEPE) Pepe is another top coin that may help you turn $100 to $100k in the long term. It is one of the top blue-chip meme coins that has stood the test of time. Technically, the coin seems to be on the verge of a strong bullish breakout now that the two lines of the falling wedge are nearing their confluence point. Pepe has also found support at $0.0000060, coinciding with the lowest swing in August last year. A simple rebound to its all-time high of $0.00002830 would imply a 370% surge from the current level. PEPE Price Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin provides another opportunity to make big returns during the ongoing crypto market crash. Like Pepe, it has formed a falling wedge pattern whose two lines are about to converge. The Relative Strength Index has also moved to the oversold level, pointing to a potential rebound. Dogecoin Price Other Top Crypto Coins to Turn $100 to $100K During the Crypto Market Crash Some of the other top crypto coins that may experience a big surge are meme coins like Shiba Inu, Bonk, Floki, and SPX6900.

Let’s break down the significance of this strategic reserve: Confidence in Bitcoin’s Longevity: StarkWare’s move signals a strong belief in Bitcoin as a long-term store of value and a foundational asset in the crypto space. It’s a vote of confidence in Bitcoin’s staying power amidst the ever-evolving world of digital currencies. Diversification and Risk Management: For any organization managing a treasury, diversification is key. By incorporating Bitcoin into their reserves, StarkWare is strategically diversifying its assets, potentially mitigating risks associated with holding primarily native tokens or other cryptocurrencies. Alignment with Crypto Ethos: Bitcoin is often seen as the original cryptocurrency, embodying the core principles of decentralization and digital sovereignty. Holding Bitcoin can be interpreted as an alignment with these fundamental values. Future Integration Opportunities: A Strategic Bitcoin Reserve could pave the way for deeper integrations between Starknet and the Bitcoin network in the future. This could unlock new possibilities for interoperability and cross-chain functionality. Starknet BTC Integration: Expanding the Horizon of Layer-2 Solutions The move to establish a Bitcoin reserve is intrinsically linked to Starknet BTC Integration . Starknet, as an Ethereum Layer-2 network, focuses on enhancing scalability and reducing transaction costs on the Ethereum blockchain.

Despite the market's crushing impact on XRP, Pi emerges as a more promising option among altcoins. This article dives into the factors driving optimism and explores why these digital assets might rise. XRP: Strong Six-Month Rally vs Short-Term Bear Pressure Over the last month, XRP experienced a 13% decline, contrasting sharply with a nearly 293% surge over the past six months. The price fluctuated between $1.60 and $2.88, indicating significant volatility recently while showcasing remarkable growth in the longer term. These figures reflect drastic short-term drops against impressive mid-term gains, underlining the coin's dynamic behavior. Currently, XRP is trading within a range defined by support at $1.06 and resistance at $3.61, with an additional resistance level at $4.89. Bearish indicators like a 41 RSI and falling momentum suggest the bulls lack strength. Traders should watch these key levels closely, waiting for a clear trend to develop before making entry decisions. Pi Network: Price Declines and Key Resistance Levels in Focus Pi Network’s price experienced significant declines over the past month and half-year. A drop of -96.90% in one month and -95.67% over six months highlights a sharp downtrend. A one-week loss of -16.45% reinforces the ongoing struggles, indicating that price momentum remains weak as it attempts to recover. The current price is near an extreme, sitting at -$134.55. Bulls are challenged by resistance levels at $266.97 and $466.36, while bearish indicators like a -29.177 Awesome Oscillator and a 35.61 RSI suggest continued downward pressure. Buyers may need to wait for a clear support breakout before engaging, as the market currently lacks a firm trend. Conclusion XRP and PI are showing strong potential for growth. XRP benefits from its established use in cross-border payments. Its partnerships with financial institutions also contribute to its positive outlook. PI is gaining traction due to its innovative approach and growing community. Both coins are well-positioned in the market. Positive trends and ongoing developments support a bullish outlook for both XRP and PI. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Mesh said in a press release that it raised $82 million in its Series B funding round. Venture capital firm Paradigm led the financing round, which attracted the participation of Consensys, QuantumLight Capital and Yolo Investments, and brought the decentralized platform’s total raise to $120 million. The funding will go into expanding the payment network’s solution across the globe, with stablecoin adoption a major part of the company’s goal. Simply, Mesh plans to bring crypto payments and stablecoin settlements to any merchant, with the target being to make it easier for cryptocurrency holders to pay with any crypto, while merchants have the benefit of faster and seamless stablecoin settlements. In this case, a user can pay with Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ) or Solana ( SOL ). Mesh’s technology will see the merchant receive the payment in a stablecoins such as PayPal USD ( PYUSD ). Payments will auto convert to the supported stablecoin. “Stablecoins present the single biggest opportunity to disrupt the payments industry since the invention of credit and debit cards, and Mesh is now first in line to scale that vision across the world,” Bam Azizi, chief executive officer and co-founder of Mesh, said.

The new CCTP V2 was only introduced on Ethereum, Avalanche, and Base; however, more chain integrations are likely to occur in 2025. The future of cross-chain is here with CCTP V2! Now available on @avax , @base , and @ethereum . Support for @LineaBuild , @arbitrum , and @solana is coming soon, with more blockchain expansions expected this year. ⚡ Fast Transfer: cross-chain USDC settlement in seconds 🔀 Hooks:… pic.twitter.com/eK9InRuv6W — Circle (@circle) March 11, 2025 CCTP V2 provides users with new features, including fast transfer and hooks Nikhil Chandhok, Circle’s chief product officer, commented, “CCTP V2 reduces the barriers that have hindered the fluid movement of digital dollars between supported blockchains.” He added that the new protocol upgrade also provides developers with even more flexibility to customize their cross-chain transaction needs. He further stated that it also facilitates low-latency applications in crypto capital markets and allows developers and users to abstract cross-chain complexities. In its official press release and on X, Circle argued that the new upgrade enables fast transfer, eliminating USDC settlement time from approximately 13 to 19 minutes to seconds. With the USD-pegged stablecoin market expected to continue expanding, enhancing transaction speed could give Circle a competitive edge as rivalry intensifies in the coming months and years. Of the approximately $235 billion in USD stablecoins currently in circulation, Circle’s USDC holds a $58 billion share. However, USDC ranks a distant second to Tether’s USDT, the dominant market leader. The CCTP V2 also features Hooks, which allows developers to automate activities such as asset swaps or treasury management on the destination blockchain, enabling efficiency for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Circle further stressed that the new upgrade has no trust assumptions and is not dependent on liquidity pools or fillers. It features a 1:1 burn-mint ratio. X users have congratulated the platform on its update, with one user actually saying the CCTP V2 appears to be a “solid upgrade,” hoping it would make cross-chain transactions easier. Circle will launch the new protocol upgrade to other networks later in the year According to Circle, the CCTP protocol has handled over $36 billion in transaction volume since its debut in 2023. The protocol was initially built to transfer digital assets across blockchains without depending on traditional liquidity pools and third-party liquidity providers. As of now, the new protocol is only supported on Avalanche, Base, and Ethereum networks, but Circle states it will support additional networks later this year. Moreover, the previous protocol, CCTP V1, will remain operational on 11 chains. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

To read full editions, subscribe . After Trump’s executive order to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve fell flat for some, we have a new development. Criticisms of the EO? The vague language around possibly buying more BTC. Plus, Trump doesn’t have Congressional support. Not yet, at least. Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis seeks to rectify that by re-introducing a bill that stalled last year. The BITCOIN Act is back. pic.twitter.com/WNeU6SWPj3 — Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) March 11, 2025 “This asset is a game-changer for the whole world,” Lummis said Tuesday at a Bitcoin Policy Institute event. “So for America — the leader in financial innovation — to have sat on the sidelines for as long as we have is unusual for us.” Trump’s executive order — committing to not selling the country’s stash of roughly 200,000 seized bitcoin — gets the US off the sidelines and “in the arena of global policymaking,” she added. But it was still just a first step. While Trump’s EO authorized the Treasury and Commerce secretaries to develop “budget-neutral” strategies to buy more bitcoin, Lummis’ bill draft offers more specifics. In case you forgot, the senator’s so-called BITCOIN Act — first unveiled last July — includes buying up to 200,000 bitcoin per year over a five-year period. So a million BTC, or roughly 5% of the asset’s total supply. The Treasury department would issue new gold certificates to the Federal Reserve that reflect current prices, and the Fed would use the difference (between the old and new certificates) to fund the buying. The Secretary of the Treasury would hold all BTC bought for and deposited in this reserve for at least 20 years to ensure its “long-term stability and security,” the bill notes. Michael Saylor spoke shortly after Lummis, doing some math for us. Moving 20 years into the future, the Strategy executive chair’s base case for bitcoin price is more than $13 million per coin. Yes, you read that right. Under that scenario, the ~200,000 BTC the US government already has from forfeiture proceedings would be worth about $3 trillion in 2045. That alone is valuable, as Saylor said frankly: “Sometimes the absence of doing awful and stupid things is making money.” He was, of course, referring to selling bitcoin. Remember this tweet from crypto/AI czar David Sacks? But the bigger opportunity is buying another million BTC to make the pile worth roughly $16 trillion, Saylor noted. Lummis was at home sick with pneumonia during Friday’s White House crypto summit . At times that meant watching news anchors mistake bitcoin with ETH and other digital assets, she said. Lummis said last month there’re Congress members still not understanding BTC’s role as a sort of “digital gold.” She noted that US states could thus approve a bitcoin reserve before the federal government. The senator’s home state is among those where bitcoin reserve proposals have recently died. Lummis’ PR team didn’t immediately comment on whether Lummis expects to see more support for the proposal this time around.

Axelar Foundation just announced a successful $30 million fundraise. But what does this mean for you, and for the future of crypto? Let’s dive into how this funding will fuel the expansion of interoperability and potentially reshape how we interact with blockchain technology. Unlocking Interoperability: Why Axelar’s Funding Matters In the ever-evolving world of crypto, interoperability is becoming increasingly crucial. Imagine a world where different blockchains can communicate and transact seamlessly, breaking down the silos and unlocking a truly connected Web3 experience. This is precisely what Axelar is aiming for, and this new funding round is a significant step in that direction. Axelar is an interoperability protocol designed to connect various blockchain ecosystems. Think of it as a universal translator for blockchains, allowing different networks to understand and interact with each other. This is vital because: Breaks Down Silos: Currently, many blockchains operate in isolation. Axelar aims to bridge these gaps, creating a more unified and efficient crypto landscape. Enhances User Experience: Users won’t be limited to a single blockchain’s ecosystem. They can move assets and data across different chains effortlessly. Boosts Innovation: Developers can build applications that leverage the strengths of multiple blockchains, fostering greater innovation and flexibility. The $30 Million Boost: Fueling Axelar’s Vision The $30 million raised by the Axelar Foundation through AXL token sales is a significant endorsement of their vision. Backed by prominent investors like Arrington Capital and Electric Capital, this funding injection will be instrumental in several key areas: Expanding Stablecoin Access: Stablecoins are crucial for everyday crypto transactions and DeFi activities. This funding will help Axelar broaden access to stablecoins across different blockchains, making them more readily available and usable. Supporting Real-World Asset (RWA) Tokenization: Tokenization of RWAs, like real estate or commodities, is gaining momentum. Axelar’s interoperability protocol can play a pivotal role in connecting institutional private blockchains to public networks, facilitating the tokenization and trading of these assets. Strengthening the Network: The funds will also be used to further develop and enhance the Axelar network, ensuring its security, scalability, and reliability as it expands its reach. Axelar vs. Competitors: Standing Out in the Interoperability Race Axelar isn’t the only player in the interoperability space. Protocols like Wormhole and LayerZero are also vying to connect the fragmented blockchain world. So, what sets Axelar apart? Feature Axelar Wormhole LayerZero Approach Universal, permissionless, open-source Message passing bridge Omnichain interoperability protocol Focus Connecting private and public blockchains Fast and efficient cross-chain messaging Lightweight messaging with configurable security Key Differentiator Emphasis on institutional adoption and RWA tokenization while maintaining open access Speed and cost-effectiveness Customizable security and decentralization Axelar’s strategy to connect institutional private blockchains while remaining permissionless and open-source is a unique selling point. This approach could be particularly appealing to institutions looking to explore blockchain technology and tokenization without compromising on control or security. The Road Ahead: Challenges and Opportunities for Axelar While the $30 million funding is a significant milestone, Axelar, like any project in the rapidly evolving crypto space, faces both challenges and opportunities: Challenges: Competition: The interoperability space is competitive. Axelar needs to continuously innovate and demonstrate its value proposition to stay ahead. Security Risks: Cross-chain bridges are inherently complex and can be targets for exploits. Robust security measures are paramount. Adoption Hurdles: Convincing institutions and developers to adopt a new interoperability protocol requires time, effort, and clear demonstration of benefits. Opportunities: RWA Tokenization Boom: The tokenization of real-world assets is predicted to be a massive growth area. Axelar is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend. Institutional Interest: Growing institutional interest in blockchain and digital assets creates a fertile ground for Axelar’s enterprise-focused solutions. Web3 Expansion: As Web3 continues to mature and expand, the need for seamless interoperability will only become more critical, further validating Axelar’s mission. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? For crypto enthusiasts and developers, Axelar’s funding round signals a positive development for the entire ecosystem. Here’s what you should consider: Keep an Eye on Axelar: Track Axelar’s progress and developments in the coming months. Their advancements in interoperability could have significant implications for the broader crypto space. Explore RWA Tokenization: If you are interested in the intersection of traditional finance and crypto, explore the potential of RWA tokenization and how protocols like Axelar are facilitating it. Understand Interoperability: Familiarize yourself with the concept of interoperability and its importance in the future of Web3. It’s a foundational element for a truly connected and user-friendly crypto ecosystem. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards a Connected Crypto Future Axelar’s $30 million fundraise is more than just a financial milestone; it’s a powerful signal that the future of crypto is increasingly interconnected. By focusing on interoperability and bridging the gaps between different blockchains, Axelar is paving the way for a more unified, efficient, and user-friendly Web3 experience. As they continue to expand stablecoin access and support RWA tokenization , Axelar’s journey is one to watch closely.

This step marks the beginning of a 21-day public comment period, after which the SEC will decide whether to approve, disapprove, or proceed with further review. The decision could have broad implications for the cryptocurrency investment landscape, especially for those interested in gaining exposure to HBAR without directly owning the asset. US SEC Acknowledges Grayscale’s Hedera ETF Filing Grayscale’s proposed ETF will track the price of Hedera’s native token, HBAR. The ETF filing was submitted by Nasdaq, which has requested SEC approval to list the Grayscale Hedera Trust. If approved, the shares of this trust would trade under commodity-based trust share rules. BNY Mellon Asset Servicing is expected to act as the administrator and transfer agent for the trust. Other key players involved include Coinbase Custody Trust Company, which will serve as the custodian, and CSC Delaware Trust Company as the trustee. Grayscale’s filing comes after the SEC approved similar applications for Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs. Nasdaq believes its surveillance-sharing agreement with Coinbase Derivatives, through ISG membership, offers sufficient investor protection. This agreement has been critical in facilitating past ETF approvals, and Nasdaq has emphasized its role in ensuring market integrity. Public Comment Period and the SEC’s Decision-Making Process Upon acknowledging the filing, the SEC has opened a 21-day public comment period, during which market participants and the general public can submit feedback. This step is part of the US SEC’s standard procedure for reviewing ETF filings. After this comment period, the regulator will make its decision to either approve or disapprove the application, or it may initiate further proceedings. While SEC acknowledgment is an important milestone, it does not guarantee approval. The SEC has previously expressed concerns about the risks associated with cryptocurrency products. However, with the recent approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs, the regulator’s stance on crypto investment products could be shifting. Grayscale is not the only firm pursuing cryptocurrency ETFs. Canary Capital also filed a similar application for a Hedera ETF earlier this year. Additionally, Grayscale has been aggressive in expanding its digital asset portfolio, seeking approval for ETFs based on assets like Polkadot (DOT), XRP, Dogecoin (DOGE), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). Will Hedera Price Surge Amid HBAR ETF Approval? Hedera price has recently faced significant fluctuations. It experienced a sharp rise toward the $0.25 level, which marked a bullish trend. However, the price has since declined and is now testing support levels around $0.18 to $0.20. If these support levels hold, there could be a potential reversal or consolidation in the coming weeks. HBAR/USD (source: TradingView) Subsequently, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows that the blue line is above the orange signal line, suggesting bullish momentum. However, the histogram is shrinking, indicating a weakening of this momentum. In addition, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 46.60, which signals neutral territory, with no clear overbought or oversold condition. A recent dip toward 41.22 shows slight bearish pressure, but it has not yet reached the oversold zone.

FLOKI Price Snapshot: Recent Decline and Key Levels to Watch FLOKI experienced a steep decline over the last month with a 36.88% drop and a 52.49% fall over the past six months, reflecting a consistent downward trend that has eroded investor confidence. Price action during these periods demonstrated persistent bearish momentum along with ongoing challenges in regaining strength. This situation highlights the token’s vulnerability within a volatile market environment. Current trading sees FLOKI priced between $0.00005656 and $0.00012231. The nearest resistance level is at $0.00016279, with support around $0.00003129 and an additional resistance at $0.00022854. A low RSI of 27.17, paired with weak momentum, suggests bears are currently in control. Traders might consider short-term opportunities within these levels while waiting for a clear breakout before making new commitments. Bonk Experiences Sharp Decline: Key Levels in Focus Bonk has dropped nearly 44% over the past month, with a six-month decline close to 40%. The coin has faced significant downward pressure, evident in its recent price movements. Strong selling has led to these losses, indicating trader and investor uncertainty during this period. Historical performance shows a challenging trend, suggesting that recovery attempts have struggled even as the market shifts. Presently, Bonk trades at around $0.0003, marking key support and resistance levels. A low RSI of 28.24 indicates oversold conditions, hinting that buyers may start to enter the market. The bears dominate with minimal momentum, so traders should watch for a potential break above $0.0003 or a solid hold at this level to signal a trend change. Pepe Price Trends: Analyzing Recent Movements and Market Sentiment Price declined 38.21% over the last month and 18.27% over the past six months, with a weekly drop near 18.04%. The coin has faced steep sell-offs recently, showing a volatile downturn without significant recovery pushes in both short- and mid-term timeframes. Current range stands between $0.00000534 and $0.00001238, with key levels marked by nearest resistance at $0.00001686 and support at $0.00000277. A secondary resistance at $0.00002390 presents an additional hurdle. Indicators reflect bear pressure, with negative oscillators and a 31.35 RSI suggesting caution. Traders might consider testing support for a short rebound and watch for breakouts against resistance levels to initiate new positions. Conclusion FLOKI , BONK , and PEPE have seen significant drops in the past three months. The future of these coins remains unclear. Market conditions and investor interest will play crucial roles in determining if a rebound is possible. For now, the bearish trend persists. Changes in sentiment or positive developments may spark a recovery, but it's uncertain when or if this will happen. Investors should keep a close eye on market trends and news updates.

Announced via a post on X, this legislation isn’t just another bill; it’s a bold statement about Bitcoin’s role in America’s future. But what exactly does this mean for the U.S. and the wider crypto world? Decoding the Bitcoin Act: A Strategic Imperative for the US? Senator Lummis frames the Bitcoin Act as more than just a regulatory framework; she positions it as a strategic element vital for maintaining America’s financial leadership in the 21st century. This reintroduction signals a renewed push to formalize the U.S. government’s stance on Bitcoin, specifically aiming to establish a national Bitcoin strategic reserve . But why is this so important? Economic Security: Lummis argues that in an increasingly digital world, a nation’s financial strength is intertwined with its embrace of innovative technologies like Bitcoin. A Bitcoin Act can pave the way for integrating Bitcoin into the national economic strategy. Global Leadership: By formalizing a US Bitcoin Strategy , the United States can assert its leadership in the burgeoning digital asset space. This proactive approach can attract innovation, investment, and talent to the country. Future-Proofing Finance: Recognizing Bitcoin as a strategic asset is about future-proofing the U.S. financial system. The Bitcoin Act suggests a forward-thinking approach to finance, acknowledging the growing importance of decentralized technologies. Why a US Bitcoin Strategy Matters Now More Than Ever In a world grappling with economic uncertainties and rapid technological advancements, the idea of a national US Bitcoin Strategy might seem unconventional to some. However, proponents like Senator Lummis believe it’s a necessary evolution. Let’s delve deeper into why this strategy holds significance: Benefit Description Financial Innovation Hub A clear US Bitcoin Strategy can position the U.S. as a global hub for cryptocurrency innovation, attracting businesses and developers. Reduced Reliance on Traditional Systems Diversifying national reserves with Bitcoin can reduce over-reliance on traditional financial instruments and potentially mitigate risks associated with inflation and economic downturns. Enhanced Technological Competitiveness Embracing Bitcoin technology through a strategic framework can spur innovation across various sectors, enhancing overall technological competitiveness. Navigating the Landscape of Cryptocurrency Legislation The reintroduction of the Bitcoin Act occurs within a complex and evolving landscape of cryptocurrency legislation globally. While some nations have outright banned or severely restricted cryptocurrencies, others are actively exploring regulatory frameworks to harness their potential. The U.S. approach, as suggested by the Bitcoin Act , leans towards strategic integration. However, challenges remain: Regulatory Clarity: The crypto industry has long called for regulatory clarity. Cryptocurrency legislation like the Bitcoin Act could provide much-needed direction, but its implementation and interpretation will be crucial. Inter-Agency Coordination: Implementing a national Bitcoin strategic reserve would require coordination across various government agencies, which can be a complex undertaking. Public and Political Acceptance: Gaining widespread public and political acceptance for a US Bitcoin Strategy will require education and addressing concerns about volatility and risk associated with cryptocurrencies. The Lummis Bitcoin Vision: A Proponent’s Perspective Senator Cynthia Lummis has emerged as a leading voice in the U.S. Senate advocating for responsible cryptocurrency adoption. Her persistent efforts to introduce and reintroduce the Bitcoin Act underscore her belief in Bitcoin’s transformative potential. The Lummis Bitcoin vision is not just about financial gains; it’s about ensuring American leadership in a rapidly changing technological landscape. Her stance is rooted in the conviction that: Bitcoin is a technological innovation that cannot be ignored. Responsible regulation is key to unlocking Bitcoin’s benefits while mitigating risks. The U.S. must be at the forefront of digital asset innovation to maintain its global standing. Bitcoin: More Than Just Tech – A Strategic Asset? The core argument behind the Bitcoin Act is that Bitcoin is not merely a technological fad or a speculative asset; it’s a strategic asset with implications for national security and economic stability. By formally recognizing Bitcoin as such, the U.S. could potentially: Strengthen its position in the global digital economy. Foster innovation in financial technology. Create new economic opportunities and jobs. Enhance financial resilience in the face of geopolitical uncertainties. The reintroduction of the Bitcoin Act by Senator Lummis marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing conversation about cryptocurrency regulation and adoption in the United States. Whether it will gain the necessary traction to become law remains to be seen, but it undeniably pushes the needle forward in recognizing Bitcoin’s strategic importance. The move underscores a growing awareness among policymakers about the need to engage with and strategically integrate digital assets into the national economic framework. As the debate unfolds, the world will be watching to see if the U.S. is ready to embrace this bold vision for the future of finance.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Bitcoin’s drop to $80k has shaken the market, but an expert sees an 80% surge ahead, fueling bullish optimism for altcoins like BTCBULL. Table of Contents Crypto markets tumble as BTC loses $10k in value Wall Street veteran maintains $150k Bitcoin forecast BTC Bull token offers alternative path during market correction Bitcoin (BTC) saw a dramatic fall to $80,000, leaving investors questioning and reassessing their positions. However, one analyst sees BTC soaring to a new all-time high. Financial expert Tom Lee remains very optimistic about Bitcoin’s trajectory, maintaining his forecast of a $150,000 valuation by December 2025 despite the current market downturn. What does his prediction mean for BTC and altcoins like BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL), which offers airdrops as Bitcoin reaches new milestones? Is this a window of opportunity for those looking to enter at reduced prices? Crypto markets tumble as BTC loses $10k in value Bitcoin’s previously stable position above $90,000 recently collapsed, sending prices plummeting to the $80,000 threshold. Many who saw $80,000 as a psychological support level watched with intense interest. BTC has since recovered slightly to $83,240 at the time of writing. Still, market sentiment remains cautious as traders attempt to determine whether this represents a temporary correction or the beginning of a more prolonged bearish phase. Technical analysis reveals a worrying pattern of consecutive lower peaks and troughs, signaling a downtrend that has technical traders concerned. The broader market reflects this atmosphere, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index registering at 20 – showing intense fear among participants. Other cryptocurrencies haven’t escaped the carnage, with Solana and XRP suffering substantial losses as the entire digital asset ecosystem retreated with Bitcoin’s downturn. You might also like: Miners forced to sell Bitcoin as rising costs squeeze profitability Wall Street veteran maintains $150k Bitcoin forecast Swimming against the current market pessimism, Fundstrat’s Tom Lee recently reaffirmed his ambitious Bitcoin price forecast during a CNBC interview that caught the attention of many market participants. Lee continues to believe that BTC will reach $150,000 before 2026 arrives – representing an approximate 80% increase from today’s valuation and offering significant potential returns for investors willing to weather the current volatility. Lee highlighted Bitcoin’s unique price behavior pattern, noting that returns typically occur in concentrated time frames rather than gradual increases. This suggests that investors who miss just a handful of Bitcoin’s best trading days could sacrifice the majority of potential bull market gains. Lee’s colleague, Mark Newton, had anticipated this pullback, suggesting prices could potentially drop further to $62,000 by March’s conclusion. This adds a note of technical caution to Lee’s otherwise bullish outlook. Despite this short-term weakness, Lee interprets major players like Citadel’s entry into the market as a positive signal that institutional adoption remains in its early phases and could drive substantial price appreciation in the coming months.

BTC Bull Token, an Ethereum-based project, has secured more than $3 million during its initial presale period, showing considerable investor interest despite the broader market downturn. Currently priced at $0.0024, BTCBULL is a unique model in the crypto space, offering BTC airdrops. These distribution events are triggered when BTC reaches specific milestones ($125,000, $150,000, $200,000), with scheduled token burns to reduce the BTCBULL supply, enhancing value for holders. With staking rewards currently estimated at 124% annual percentage yield, some risk-tolerant investors are joining in. The investors optimistic about Bitcoin’s success over the next few years – especially as governments continue to contemplate adding it to their reserves – see BTC Bull as a way to capture that value without buying Bitcoin. Cryptocurrency commentator ClayBro suggests BTCBULL could experience significant growth upon its listing on decentralized exchanges. However, as with all cryptocurrency investments, particularly those in the early stages, investors should conduct thorough research and consider their risk tolerance before committing capital.

Yes, you read that right. While often associated with ‘America First’ rhetoric and policies seemingly aimed at benefiting the US dollar, certain global economic shifts triggered by Trump’s actions are inadvertently contributing to the Euro’s newfound vigor. Let’s dive into this fascinating paradox and explore how Trump’s moves are, in a roundabout way, making the Euro ‘great again’. Decoding the Paradox: Trump Policies and Euro Strength It might seem counterintuitive at first glance. Trump’s presidency was characterized by trade tensions, tariffs, and a generally assertive stance on international trade, often perceived as negative for global economic stability and, by extension, potentially detrimental to currencies outside the US dollar. However, digging deeper reveals a more nuanced picture where some of these very policies are creating conditions that favor Euro strength . Here’s a breakdown of how this seemingly paradoxical situation is unfolding: Increased Global Uncertainty: Trump’s ‘America First’ approach and trade disputes injected significant uncertainty into the global economic landscape. This uncertainty, while not directly targeting the Euro, has led investors to diversify away from perceived riskier assets, and in some cases, towards the Euro as a relatively stable alternative. Dollar Weakness as a Byproduct: Some of Trump’s fiscal policies, such as tax cuts, coupled with increased government spending, led to a rise in the US national debt. Concerns about long-term US fiscal health and potential inflation can, paradoxically, weaken the US dollar. A weaker dollar, in turn, often translates to a stronger Euro in the EURUSD pair, as it’s the most heavily traded currency pair globally. European Resilience in Trade Dynamics: While Trump’s trade policies created friction, they also pushed European nations to look inward and strengthen intra-EU trade relationships. This focus on internal market strength, combined with a more unified front in international trade negotiations (post-Brexit), may have bolstered the Eurozone’s economic standing and, consequently, the Euro itself. Geopolitical Shifts and Safe-Haven Status: Turbulence in global geopolitics, partly fueled by shifts in US foreign policy under Trump, can sometimes elevate the status of other major currencies as ‘safe havens’. While the US dollar traditionally holds this position, periods of heightened global risk can see investors allocating funds to other stable currencies like the Euro, driving up its value. Unpacking the EURUSD Dynamic The EURUSD currency pair is the world’s most liquid and heavily traded, representing the exchange rate between the Euro and the US dollar. Understanding its movements is crucial for grasping the dynamics of global currency markets. Trump’s policies have undeniably played a role in shaping the recent trajectory of EURUSD. Factor Impact on EURUSD Explanation US Fiscal Expansion under Trump Upward pressure on EURUSD Increased US government debt and potential inflation concerns can weaken the USD, strengthening the EUR in the pair. Trade Wars and Global Uncertainty Upward pressure on EURUSD Uncertainty can lead to diversification away from USD and towards perceived safe havens like EUR. European Central Bank (ECB) Policies Mixed, but recently leaning towards upward pressure ECB’s monetary policy decisions, while aimed at Eurozone stability, can indirectly influence EURUSD. Shifts towards less dovish stances can support Euro strength. Global Economic Growth Differentials Variable impact Relative growth rates between the US and Eurozone economies can influence capital flows and EURUSD. Benefits of a Stronger Euro While a stronger Euro can have mixed implications, there are several potential benefits for the Eurozone economy: Reduced Import Costs: A stronger Euro makes imports cheaper for Eurozone businesses and consumers. This can help to keep inflation in check and lower the cost of goods. Increased Purchasing Power: Eurozone citizens traveling or shopping abroad benefit from a stronger Euro, as their currency buys more goods and services in other countries. Attractiveness for Investment: A strong and stable currency can enhance the Eurozone’s attractiveness as a destination for foreign investment. Lower Commodity Prices (in Euro terms): Many commodities are priced in US dollars. A stronger Euro means these commodities become cheaper for Eurozone buyers. Challenges and Considerations It’s crucial to acknowledge that a rapidly strengthening Euro also presents challenges: Exports Become More Expensive: A stronger Euro makes Eurozone exports more expensive for buyers in other currency zones. This can potentially dampen export competitiveness and impact export-oriented industries. Potential for Deflationary Pressures: While cheaper imports can be beneficial, excessively strong currency appreciation can contribute to deflationary pressures, which central banks generally try to avoid. Impact on Tourism: While Eurozone citizens traveling abroad benefit, tourism into the Eurozone might become more expensive for visitors from countries with weaker currencies. Central Bank Intervention: If the Euro strengthens too rapidly, the European Central Bank (ECB) might consider interventions to manage its appreciation and maintain price stability and economic balance. Navigating the Forex Markets in the Era of Unconventional Currency Dynamics For those active in forex markets , understanding these unconventional currency dynamics is paramount. The interplay of global politics, fiscal policies, and monetary strategies creates a complex landscape where unexpected factors can influence currency valuations. Traders need to: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of global political and economic developments, not just in the US and Eurozone, but worldwide. Diversify Strategies: Relying solely on traditional economic indicators might not be sufficient. Incorporate geopolitical risk analysis and consider unconventional factors like the indirect impacts of policies from major economies. Manage Risk Carefully: Currency markets can be volatile, especially in times of global uncertainty. Employ robust risk management strategies to protect your capital. Consider Long-Term Trends: While short-term fluctuations are common, try to identify longer-term trends and underlying forces driving currency movements. The surprising Euro strength phenomenon might be indicative of deeper shifts in the global financial order. Conclusion: An Unforeseen Currency Consequence The narrative of Trump’s policies inadvertently contributing to global currency markets shifts that favor the Euro is a compelling example of the interconnectedness and often unpredictable nature of the global economy. While not a direct intention, certain policies and their global repercussions have created an environment where the Euro is experiencing unexpected tailwinds. Whether this trend continues in the long term remains to be seen, but it serves as a powerful reminder that in the complex world of international finance, actions can have unintended, and sometimes paradoxical, consequences. The rise of Euro strength in this context is a story worth watching closely.

Taproot Wizards, the innovative team behind the Bitcoin Ordinals inscription project, is unleashing their highly anticipated “Wizards” NFT collection onto the market. This isn’t just another NFT drop; it’s a foray into the unique capabilities of Bitcoin Ordinals, and it’s happening through a public Dutch auction. Let’s dive into what makes this Wizards NFT Auction so special and what you need to know to potentially snag a piece of Bitcoin history. What are Taproot Wizards and Bitcoin Ordinals NFTs? Before we delve into the auction details, let’s quickly recap what Taproot Wizards and Bitcoin Ordinals are all about. Think of Bitcoin Ordinals as a way to inscribe data directly onto individual satoshis – the smallest units of Bitcoin. This groundbreaking protocol, launched in early 2023, opened up a new frontier for creating NFTs directly on the Bitcoin blockchain itself, moving beyond the traditional reliance on smart contract platforms like Ethereum. Taproot Wizards is one of the pioneering projects leveraging Bitcoin Ordinals. They’re not just creating any NFTs; they are focusing on building a community and culture around these unique digital assets. Their “Wizards” collection is a prime example of this vision, aiming to showcase the artistic and collectible potential within the Bitcoin ecosystem. This innovative approach to Bitcoin Ordinals NFT creation sets them apart in the rapidly evolving NFT landscape. The Allure of the Wizards NFT Collection So, what makes the Wizards NFTs so captivating? Here’s a breakdown: Bitcoin Native: These NFTs are inscribed directly on the Bitcoin blockchain, offering a level of security and immutability that resonates with Bitcoin purists. Unique Art: The Wizards collection promises distinctive and visually engaging artwork, tapping into fantasy themes and the mystique of magic, appealing to collectors seeking visually striking and conceptually rich NFTs. Community Focus: Taproot Wizards is building a strong community around their project, fostering a sense of belonging and shared enthusiasm among collectors. Owning a Wizard NFT isn’t just about the art; it’s about joining a movement. Pioneering Project: Being part of the Taproot Wizards journey means being at the forefront of the Bitcoin NFT space. This collection represents a significant step in exploring the potential of Ordinals and Bitcoin for digital collectibles. Decoding the NFT Dutch Auction for Wizards Taproot Wizards has chosen a Dutch auction format for the sale of their Wizards NFT Auction . But what exactly is a Dutch auction, and how does it work for buying NFTs? In a Dutch auction, the price starts high and gradually decreases over time until a bidder steps in and purchases the item. This is different from a traditional English auction where the price starts low and increases with bids. Here’s how it’s playing out for the Wizards NFT sale: Starting Price: For whitelisted participants, the auction begins at 0.2 BTC per NFT. Price Decrement: If no one bids at the initial price, the asking price will gradually decrease. The exact decrement schedule is usually pre-defined and publicly available. Bidding Process: Potential buyers monitor the price and place a bid when they feel the price is right. The first bidder at the current price secures the NFT. Fair Price Discovery: Dutch auctions are often seen as a fair mechanism for price discovery, as the market itself determines the perceived value of the NFTs. Table: Dutch Auction vs. English Auction Feature Dutch Auction English Auction Starting Price High Low Price Movement Decreases over time Increases with bids Bidding Strategy Wait for desired price, bid quickly Bid incrementally to outbid others Price Discovery Market-driven, finds equilibrium Competitive bidding, potential for overbidding Why a Dutch Auction for Bitcoin NFTs? Choosing a Dutch auction for this Bitcoin NFT Collection sale is a strategic move by Taproot Wizards. Here’s why it makes sense: Generate Excitement and Urgency: The decreasing price creates a sense of urgency. Buyers are incentivized to act quickly before someone else snatches the NFT at a lower price. Fair Distribution: It allows for potentially fairer distribution, as everyone has a chance to bid at a price they deem reasonable. It reduces the advantage of those with faster bots or network connections, which can be prevalent in fixed-price sales or traditional auctions. Market Price Discovery: It effectively gauges the market’s true valuation of the Wizards NFTs. The final sale prices will reflect what buyers are actually willing to pay, providing valuable data for future projects in the Bitcoin Ordinals space. Reduce Gas Wars (on other chains): While Bitcoin transactions have fees, Dutch auctions on Bitcoin Ordinals avoid the intense “gas wars” seen on platforms like Ethereum during popular NFT drops, where users compete by paying exorbitant transaction fees to get their transactions processed faster. Potential Benefits and Challenges of Participating in the Wizards NFT Auction Considering jumping into the Wizards NFT Auction ? Let’s weigh the potential benefits and challenges: Benefits: Early Adopter Advantage: Be among the first to own a piece from a potentially iconic Bitcoin Ordinals NFT collection. Early adopters often see greater appreciation in value if the project gains traction. Unique Collectible: Acquire a distinctive digital artwork that is verifiably scarce and permanently inscribed on the Bitcoin blockchain. Community Membership: Gain access to the Taproot Wizards community and potentially future perks or drops associated with holding a Wizard NFT. Investment Potential: Bitcoin NFTs are a nascent market. Successful projects like Wizards could appreciate significantly in value as the market matures. Challenges: Price Volatility: The price of Bitcoin and NFTs can be highly volatile. There’s no guarantee that the value of Wizards NFTs will increase after purchase. Dutch Auction Uncertainty: Predicting the optimal bidding time in a Dutch auction can be tricky. You might bid too early and pay more than necessary, or wait too long and miss out altogether. Bitcoin Transaction Fees: While not “gas wars,” Bitcoin transactions do have fees. You’ll need to factor in transaction costs when participating in the auction. Novel Technology Risks: Bitcoin Ordinals and NFTs are still relatively new technologies. There are inherent risks associated with any emerging technology, including potential bugs, security vulnerabilities, or unforeseen issues. Actionable Insights for Aspiring Wizard NFT Collectors Ready to participate in the Wizards NFT Auction ? Here are some actionable insights: Do Your Research: Thoroughly research Taproot Wizards, the Wizards NFT collection, and Bitcoin Ordinals NFTs in general. Understand the project’s vision, the team behind it, and the potential risks and rewards. Understand Dutch Auctions: Familiarize yourself with the mechanics of Dutch auctions. Develop a bidding strategy based on your risk tolerance and perceived value of the NFTs. Set a Budget: Determine how much you are willing to spend and stick to it. Don’t get caught up in the auction frenzy and overspend. Monitor the Price: Keep a close eye on the auction price as it decreases. Be ready to bid when you reach your target price point. Secure Your Bitcoin Wallet: Ensure you have a secure Bitcoin wallet ready to participate in the auction and store your NFTs if you are successful. Join the Community: Engage with the Taproot Wizards community on social media or forums. This can provide valuable insights and updates about the auction. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Bitcoin NFTs? The Taproot Wizards Wizards NFT Auction marks a significant moment in the evolution of Bitcoin NFTs. By leveraging the Bitcoin Ordinals protocol and employing a Dutch auction mechanism, they are pushing the boundaries of digital collectibles on the world’s most secure blockchain. Whether you are a seasoned NFT collector or a Bitcoin enthusiast curious about this new frontier, the Wizards collection offers a unique opportunity to participate in what could be a groundbreaking chapter for Bitcoin and the NFT space. Keep an eye on the auction, do your due diligence, and you might just conjure up a coveted Wizard NFT for your collection!

Thankfully, President Trump is with us and the opportunities are boundless,” Lummis concluded. Just last week, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to create a federal strategic Bitcoin reserve. The reserve is to be made up of confiscated bitcoin by the federal government from hacks and seizures, creating an estimated reserve of about 200,000 BTC, pending an official audit. However, this reserve, as it stands, has the potential to be overturned by future presidential administrations. Legislation like the Bitcoin Act of 2025 would solve this potential issue as it would see the United States purchase 200,000 bitcoin per year until it has bought a total of 1,000,000 BTC — to be held for a minimum of 20 years. $115 billion asset manager VanEck claims that this strategic bitcoin reserve “could help offset national debt”, stating that “if the U.S. government follows the BITCOIN Act’s proposed path – accumulating 1 million BTC by 2029 – our analysis suggests this reserve could offset around $21 trillion of national debt by 2049.” This post US Senator And Congressman Introduce Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Bills To Buy One Million BTC first appeared on Bitcoin Magazine and is written by Nik .",NEWS|Bitcoin Policy Institute|bitcoin strategic reserve|cynthia lummis,EN,0,0,ETH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|TRADING|FORKS|FIAT|REGULATION|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoin Magazine', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinmagazine.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinmagazine,2025-03-11 19:51:45

The sharp decline has sparked broader market panic, with weak technical indicators and fading network activity compounding concerns. As Solana struggles to regain momentum, investors are left questioning whether the altcoin can stage a recovery or if further downside is on the cards. Solana one-month price chart.

Factoring in technical indicators and market trends, the model forecasts an average SOL price of $133.83. If met, this forecast would equate to a 7.59% increase from current levels. Finbold AI SOL price prediction. Source: Finbold The most bullish price target comes from Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which predicts a 13.76% rally, placing SOL at $141.50 by the end of the month. On the other hand, Gemini 1.5 Flash 002 and GPT-4o present a more conservative scenario, both expecting SOL to reach $130.00, representing a 4.51% increase. Their forecasts suggest a tempered bullish sentiment, likely influenced by broader market conditions or a lack of bullish catalysts. Solana broader market outlook Despite AI-driven optimism for SOL’s price, Solana’s network fundamentals have taken a major hit, with weekly revenue collapsing from $55 million in January to just $4 million last week—marking a 93% drop. Meanwhile, the total value locked (TVL) in Solana’s DeFi ecosystem has plunged nearly 50%, dropping from $12 billion in January to around $6.4 billion on March 11 as per the data from DefiLlama. However, despite the concerning decline in network revenue and DeFi activity, Solana’s derivatives market data signals renewed bullish momentum, suggesting that traders are positioning for a potential price recovery. Trading volume has surged by 8.49% to $12.95 billion, a sign of increased market participation, while open interest has climbed 3.36% to $3.74 billion, indicating fresh capital inflows into SOL derivatives. Moreover, options open interest is up 3.49% to $8.62 million, signaling greater speculative activity and potential hedging for an anticipated price move. Further supporting the bullish case, long/short ratios on Binance and OKX exceed 3.7, showing that traders are overwhelmingly positioned on the long side. Meanwhile, short liquidations have been outpacing long liquidations in multiple timeframes, particularly in the one-hour, four-hour, and 12-hour periods, which suggests that a short squeeze could propel SOL’s price higher. If momentum sustains, SOL could break out toward $350 to $400 in the mid-term, with even greater upside possible in the long run, mirroring its historic 2021 rally.

The decision was made after a lot of demand from the altcoin community. Coinbase typically stops supporting altcoins when the tokens migrate to their own network or leave the Ethereum network. Celo had been planning to transition from its own layer 1 blockchain to an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain with a decision it made a while ago. This transition is expected to take place on March 25. Coinbase stated in its statement that during the transition period, the sending and receiving of CGLD, or CELO, tokens will be temporarily suspended.

The formation of higher lows suggests that buyers are maintaining control, reinforcing the possibility of further gains. Resistance levels remain critical for confirming the next phase of the rally. The primary breakout target of $0.6533 remains in focus, with Fibonacci extension levels providing additional reference points.

Pal tells his 1.1 million followers on the social media platform X that a historical relationship between Bitcoin and the global money supply (M2) metric suggests that the top digital asset by market cap is gearing up for a massive breakout. “This too shall pass. Crypto is still feeling the tightening in liquidity from the stronger dollar and higher rates in Q4 2024. That is almost done and financial conditions are easing fast and M2 is headed back to new highs. This is just a regular correction.” Source: Raoul Pal/X Pal believes Bitcoin is repeating a similar 2017 price pattern correlated with the M2 metric, when President Donald Trump came into office for his first term. Bitcoin had a steep correction in 2017, but then took off on a series of rallies. “We had the exact same correction in 2017 caused by the same reaction to Trump policies (higher dollar and higher rates which then reversed).” Source: Raoul Pal/X Pal also believes Bitcoin will start trading higher within a logarithmic regression channel, a form of technical analysis that aims to show the approximate highs and lows of an asset’s long-term trend. “Over time, we just keep climbing the log regression channel. Whether we stay at the main (red) or climb above it by another standard deviation or two remains to be seen as the cycle develops.” Source: Raoul Pal/X Bitcoin is trading for $80,703 at time of writing, up 1.4% in the last 24 hours.

The focus now is on whether these digital currencies can pivot from their downturn and uncover new growth potential. This article will explore the factors that could lead to a resurgence for these cryptocurrencies. Starknet (STRK) Market Snapshot: Past Trends and Current Levels STRK dropped by 37.64% over the past month and lost 60.83% in the last six months, highlighting a decisive downtrend. A weekly decline of 23.81% illustrates heightened volatility with persistent selling pressure. The coin has registered continuous losses and minimal recovery attempts, reflecting a market heavily influenced by bearish sentiment. The coin currently trades between $0.145 and $0.322, with resistance at $0.43 and a second resistance near $0.61, while support is at $0.07. Bears dominate the market, indicated by a low RSI of 29.349 and negative momentum indicators. Traders should monitor these levels for potential pullbacks or bounces, as the market seems to be consolidating before any clear trend re-emerges. LayerZero: Bearish Past, Oversold Market Near Key Resistance Past price moves show a steep decline with a drop of about 40% in one month and nearly 55% over the past six months. The coin’s value has steadily fallen from higher levels, reflecting a persistent downtrend. Price behavior over these periods indicates significant volatility and weakness, consistent with indicators tracking momentum and recent selloffs. Current trading sees LayerZero moving within the range of $1.92 to $3.61, with clear support at $1.18 and resistance near $4.55 and $6.24. Bears seem to dominate as the price remains under pressure, with RSI below 30 and negative momentum indicators. Trading ideas revolve around watching for a bounce at support while being alert to significant reversals at the resistance levels. Conclusion Given the recent price drop, STRK and ZRO might still uncover new opportunities. Market patterns often reveal that selling pressure can lead to potential rebounds. These downturns may help in identifying buy-ins for long-term gains. Historically, tokens with solid fundamentals often experience recoveries. STRK and ZRO need to maintain their focus on development and community engagement. This approach could position them to capitalize on future market trends. Monitoring their performance in upcoming weeks is essential. The ability to adapt and innovate will be key for both tokens. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

A March 11 Bloomberg report citing people familiar with the matter claims that national watchdogs from the EU’s member states discussed the issue during a March 6 meeting hosted by the European Securities and Markets Authority’s Digital Finance Standing Committee. The issue appears to be OKX’s decentralized finance platform and wallet service. On Jan. 27, OKX announced that it had secured a full Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) license to operate across all EU member states under a unified regulatory framework. The question for EU regulators is whether two OKX services fall under the MiCA framework and, if so, whether the exchange could be penalized. According to Bybit CEO Ben Zhou, nearly $100 million, or 40,233 Ether ( ETH ), from the $1.5 billion hack had been laundered through OKX’s Web3 proxy, with a portion of the funds now untraceable. OKX’s wallet service has reached 53 million addresses and is able to connect to 100 blockchains. Fully decentralized platforms may be exempt from MiCA regulation , but according to the Bloomberg report, regulators from at least Austria and Croatia said OKX’s Web3 service should fall under EU rules. Related: Bybit hacker launders 100% of stolen $1.4B crypto in 10 days OKX denies EU investigation In a statement posted to X, OKX refuted the claim there were any ongoing investigations by the EU, adding that “Bybit’s statements are spreading misinformation” and defending its Web3 wallet services. Source: OKX Haider Rafique, OKX Global’s chief marketing officer, added his own take: “We spoke to Bloomberg today and provided our statement refuting some of the alleged claims. It is preposterous to suggest that WE as a company would be involved in laundering stolen funds.” The theft of $1.5 billion in ETH and ETH-related tokens from Bybit is the largest crypto hack to date. Crypto investigators have said that the Lazarus Group , a North Korean hacking ring, was responsible for the attack . According to Zhou, who declared war on the Lazarus Group after the hack, 3% of the stolen funds have been frozen, while 20% have gone dark .

To read full editions, subscribe . Members of the House Financial Services Committee heard from crypto and banking executives on the state of payment stablecoins this morning. Lawmakers have a few bills to consider: the STABLE Act , Rep. Tom Emmer’s anti-CBDC bill , and the CRA seeking to overturn the CFPB’s new rule that would expand federal supervision over wallet and payment providers. The hearing comes as the industry continues to quarrel over what stablecoin regulation should look like in the US. In the Senate, the latest discussion draft of the GENIUS Act sets reserve and anti-money laundering requirements for overseas stablecoin issuers. The bill is set to go to mark-up on Thursday. Both the GENIUS Act and the STABLE Act seek to divide oversight authority between federal and state agencies. Party lines showed during today’s hearing. Rep. Maxine Waters, in her opening remarks, criticized the Trump administration for its approach to the digital asset industry. “Despite my belief that the Trump administration only wants crypto legislation that personally benefits them and protects [its] crypto financiers, I still hope that we can work together on a bill that requires stablecoins be robustly and fairly regulated,” Waters said to Rep. French Hill. Trump last week said he expects to have a stablecoin bill on his desk by August. But if committees keep up their current pace, a bill could make it to a full floor vote sooner. Of course, for anything to make it to the White House, both chambers will have to approve the legislation. That could be a tall order. Get the news in your inbox.

Investors paid over $3 million to MUTM during its presale period and the system received 5,000 token purchasers before its exchange market entry. Tokens are being released in phase 3 as of now. The professional analysis of MUTM indicates that investors will achieve a 200% token value appreciation until the market introduces it for $0.06. New research indicates that MUTM will rise to $1.50 by 2025 because of how DeFi functions alongside its earning capabilities. Presale Momentum and Investor Confidence Under market conditions of volatility the Ethereum and XRP communities show strong collective interest toward purchasing MUTM tokens. The investors in presale phase three take advantage of early investment opportunities until the price rises 25% from $0.02 to $0.025 in phase 4. The early participants in MUTM will achieve a 200% return because the project will list for $0.06 during its launch. This project sets actual token values to control market speculations instead of focusing on popularity growth. Institutional-level backing for this protocol exists because professional investors share an equal opportunity for buying tokens as retail customers do. MUTM maintains its market value through two operations which consist of interest-bearing loans alongside buyback procedures that stimulate ongoing market requirement. Loan revenues permit the system to purchase MUTM tokens and send them back to stakers while reducing the tokens available in the market. More users in the platform create additional growth while new products added to available services lead to higher token prices. Tokenomics and Post-Launch Projections Mutuum Finance operates under two methods for decentralization through decentralized lending and tokenized deposits. Supply users need to provide ETH or stablecoins to receive mtTokens which gain more value as time progresses. Users can obtain passive income through mtTokens regardless of their choice to trade MUTM tokens because these tokens distribute across various DeFi applications. The platform distributes 30% of its market sales to its functional stakers due to its automated purchasing mechanism. The determination of market opportunity value requires experts to make only fundamental starting assumptions. Investors receive a minimum return on investment of $0.06 from which they can recover their investment three times before the future price projections increase substantially beyond this starting point. Mutuum Finance’s specific token supply structure along with its revenue model can elevate its market value to $1.50 during 2025 representing a 9,900% increase from its present presale cost. The specified value threshold will generate $100,000 profit from an initial current-term investment of $1,000. Market performance relies on natural adoption growth but Mutuum Finance separates itself through its P2P lending and loan basic features which give it distinct value in the market. Through its protocol the system bridges decentralized liquidity measures with traditional financial markets through an asset-to-token conversion method. External auditor agreements demonstrate the security of smart contracts thus attracting cautious investors who will participate in the platform. The platform becomes rapidly popular through a $100,000 presale reward program with community incentives which also awards winners in the system with $10,000 each. More users choose to interact with MUTM because of the actual opportunity generated by mtTokens’ APY system. Global investors need to buy into MUTM’s presale at $0.02 before the third phase ends because the following phase would boost costs by 25%. Expert analysts rank MUTM the top investment of 2025 because its DeFi features and mathematical earning assurance work together. Investors can join Mutuum Finance via the website before they end the presale period.

But what does this mean for Jupiter, the Solana ecosystem, and you as a crypto enthusiast? Let’s dive deep into this groundbreaking proposal and understand its potential ramifications. What Exactly is the Jupiter Token Lock-Up Proposal? Imagine locking away a significant portion of your assets for an extended period. That’s essentially what this proposal entails! The core of the discussion is the proposed 2030 Lock-in, spearheaded by Jupiter’s co-founder, “meow.” Here’s a breakdown of what was on the table: The Proposal: Lock up 280 million JUP tokens until the year 2030. The Incentive: In return for this long-term commitment, “meow” would receive an additional 220 million JUP tokens. The Verdict: The crypto governance proposal went to a community vote, and it passed with a decisive 63% in favor. This isn’t just a simple token shuffling exercise; it’s a strategic move with potential long-term implications for the entire Solana ecosystem and the broader DeFi landscape. Let’s unpack why this proposal is significant and what it could mean for the future of Jupiter and its users. Why Did the Jupiter Community Vote Yes to the Lock-Up? A 63% approval rate suggests strong community backing. But what were the driving forces behind this decision? Let’s consider some potential reasons: Long-Term Vision: Locking up tokens for an extended period signals a strong belief in the long-term success of Jupiter . It’s a powerful message of commitment to the project’s future, potentially attracting more investors and users who value stability and longevity. Incentivizing Leadership: Rewarding “meow” with additional tokens can be seen as an incentive for their continued dedication and leadership. In the decentralized world, retaining key contributors is crucial, and this could be a way to ensure “meow” remains invested in Jupiter’s growth. Reduced Circulating Supply: Locking up 280 million JUP tokens reduces the circulating supply, which, in theory, could positively impact the token’s price due to scarcity, assuming demand remains constant or increases. Strengthening Decentralization: Community voting on such significant proposals reinforces the principles of decentralization and empowers token holders to shape the future of the platform. This active crypto governance participation is a hallmark of robust DeFi projects. Potential Benefits of the Jupiter JUP Token Lock-Up Beyond the immediate implications, this lock-up proposal could unlock several benefits for Jupiter and its ecosystem. Let’s explore some of them: Increased Stability and Confidence: A long-term lock-up can instill greater confidence in the project. It signals to the market that key stakeholders are in it for the long haul, reducing concerns about potential token dumps and price volatility. Enhanced Decentralization and Governance: This vote highlights the power of crypto governance in action. It demonstrates that the Jupiter community actively participates in decision-making, fostering a truly decentralized and community-driven platform. Attracting Long-Term Investors: The commitment implied by the lock-up could attract investors who are looking for projects with staying power and a long-term vision, benefiting the entire Solana ecosystem . Potential Price Appreciation: With a reduced circulating supply and increased confidence, the demand for JUP tokens could potentially rise, leading to price appreciation over time. Are There Any Challenges or Concerns? While the proposal has been met with majority approval, it’s important to consider potential challenges and concerns: Liquidity Concerns: Locking up a significant amount of tokens, even if for a key individual, could raise concerns about liquidity, albeit indirectly. The immediate circulating supply of JUP is reduced. Centralization Risks: While the vote was decentralized, rewarding a single individual with a large token allocation might raise questions about centralization of influence, even if that individual is a co-founder. Opportunity Cost: Locking up tokens for seven years is a long time in the fast-paced crypto world. There’s always an opportunity cost associated with locking up assets, as these tokens cannot be used for other purposes during this period. Community Sentiment Evolution: While the proposal passed with 63% now, community sentiment can evolve. It’s crucial for Jupiter to maintain open communication and address any future concerns that may arise from this lock-up. Crypto Governance in Action: A Case Study of Jupiter The Jupiter token lock-up proposal serves as a compelling case study in decentralized crypto governance . It showcases how communities can directly influence the direction of a project through voting and proposals. This instance highlights several key aspects of effective governance: Aspect Description Jupiter Example Transparency Proposals and voting processes are open and accessible to the community. The lock-up proposal was publicly discussed and voted upon via SolanaFloor and other community channels. Community Participation Token holders are empowered to vote and influence decisions. 63% of voters supported the proposal, demonstrating active community engagement. Decentralized Decision-Making Power is distributed among token holders, rather than concentrated in a central authority. The outcome of the community vote dictated the implementation of the lock-up proposal. Long-Term Vision Governance decisions are made with the long-term sustainability and growth of the project in mind. The 2030 lock-up proposal aims to secure the long-term future of Jupiter and the Solana ecosystem . Actionable Insights for JUP Token Holders and the Solana Ecosystem So, what are the key takeaways and actionable insights from this development? For JUP Token Holders: Stay informed about Jupiter’s governance proposals and actively participate in voting. Your voice matters in shaping the future of the platform. Monitor the impact of the lock-up on token price and community sentiment. For the Solana Ecosystem: The success of Jupiter’s governance model can serve as an example for other projects within the Solana ecosystem . Strong governance is vital for the long-term health and decentralization of the ecosystem. For DeFi Enthusiasts: Pay attention to projects with robust governance mechanisms. They are often more resilient and community-aligned in the long run. Jupiter’s move is a significant example of how DeFi projects are evolving and maturing. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards Jupiter’s Future The passing of the Jupiter token lock-up proposal marks a significant moment for the platform and the Solana ecosystem . It’s a bold move that signals long-term commitment and strengthens the project’s foundations. While challenges may exist, the community’s decisive vote in favor of this proposal reflects a strong belief in Jupiter’s vision and future potential. As crypto governance continues to evolve, Jupiter’s example provides valuable insights into how decentralized communities can shape the trajectory of DeFi projects.

Accumulation patterns and ETF moves signal broader hesitance. Indicators suggest this isn’t a routine pullback but a deeper recalibration. Underlying vulnerabilities may reshape long-term trends. Bitcoin’s valuation metrics are pointing to bearish territory, and according to a CryptoQuant analyst, the market may be teetering between deep value levels and the onset of a bear market. https://twitter.com/cryptoquant_com/status/1899464577966018585 ryptoQuant’s analysis, published on March 11, reveals that nearly every major indicator now signals caution. The Bitcoin Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator is currently at its most bearish level this cycle—a level that, in previous cycles, has either preceded a sharp correction or marked the beginning of a downturn. In parallel, the MVRV Ratio Z-score has fallen below its 365-day moving average, suggesting that Bitcoin’s previously sustained upward momentum has markedly dissipated. This shift in sentiment can be seen by the noticeable contraction in Bitcoin demand. Recently, the apparent demand growth for Bitcoin dropped by 103,000 BTC in a single week, representing the fastest pace of contraction observed since July 2024. Bitcoin Whales Slow Accumulation, Signaling Reduced Demand This steep decline indicates clear buyer hesitation and weakening market support. Major whales, who have traditionally played a role in driving market movements through their huge accumulations, have also slowed their rate of Bitcoin acquisition. U.S.-based spot ETFs have transitioned into net sellers of Bitcoin this year, further adding downward pressure on prices. While Bitcoin’s current 22% price drawdown might seem in line with corrections experienced during previous bull market cycles, the valuation metrics paint a more concerning picture. The metrics indicate that this is not a typical pullback but rather a deeper, more fundamental correction. Bitcoin is trading around $81,000 as of writing—a range slightly below the trader’s on-chain realized price lower band, a key support level. This precarious position was compounded Tuesday as the broader crypto market shed 6% amid investor anxiety triggered by President Donald Trump’s latest trade policies. Heightened tensions over tariffs targeting major U.S. trading partners—Canada, Mexico, and China—have rattled markets, prompting a wave of sell-offs across risk assets Should Bitcoin fail to maintain this support, its next major target is around $63,000. This level corresponds with the Trader’s minimum on-chain realized price band, a threshold that has historically acted as the ultimate safety net during severe price corrections. The insights provided by the CryptoQuant analyst highlight a convergence of factors that are amplifying market uncertainty. Given the bearish signals, reduced demand, slowing whale accumulation, and ETFs becoming net sellers, Bitcoin’s market stands at a critical juncture. Investors face an essential question: Are these indicators simply short-term anomalies, or do they signify deeper, structural vulnerabilities in the Bitcoin market? How stakeholders interpret these signals in the coming weeks could determine whether Bitcoin rebounds strongly or slips further into bearish territory. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What could a deeper correction mean for Bitcoin’s long-term outlook? A deeper correction may signal a market reset, exposing underlying vulnerabilities while offering strategic entry points. This phase can recalibrate inflated valuations and potentially foster a more robust, sustainable long-term Bitcoin trend. How might institutional actions influence the current Bitcoin trend? Shifts in institutional behavior, like changes in ETF strategies and slower accumulation, can drive broader market sentiment. Their actions affect liquidity and may shape Bitcoin’s price trajectory significantly. What broader economic factors could amplify Bitcoin’s current market dynamics? Wider economic shifts, like political unrest and changes in trade rules, can make markets more unpredictable.

In a new announcement, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA) says it has obtained the necessary approvals from the country’s securities regulator, the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV), to offer its customers trading services for the top two digital assets by market cap. The services will roll out in phases in the coming months. Says BBVA, “The bank is set to launch a new service, accessible to all its customers, enabling them to securely buy, sell and manage Bitcoin and Ethereum transactions through its app. Initially, the service will be rolled out to a small group of users and gradually extended to all private customers in Spain over the coming months. This initiative builds on the bank’s experience in Switzerland and Turkey, where similar services have been offered since 2021 and 2023, respectively.” BBVA also says Spain customers will have the ability to trade their crypto via the same app the bank’s customers currently use for their traditional banking activities. “This approach enables the bank to deliver an integrated and seamless experience across its digital channels while advancing its digitization strategy. A key distinguishing feature of the new service is that BBVA will utilize its own cryptographic key custody platform, allowing the bank to maintain full control over safeguarding its customers’ crypto assets without relying on third parties.” Says Gonzalo Rodríguez, head of BBVA’s retail banking in Spain, “We want to make it easier for our customers to invest in crypto assets with a simple, accessible offering available directly from their mobile phones, in a fully digital manner. Our goal is to guide them as they explore this new segment of digital assets, backed by the solvency and security assurances provided by a bank like BBVA.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Gox Sparks Market Jitters,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/931-million-bitcoin-on-the-move-mt-gox-sparks-market-jitters/,"Mt. Gox, the Bitcoin exchange that is now insolvent, has transferred 11,833.6 BTC, totaling approximately $931 million, to new addresses, in a significant development within the cryptocurrency community. The prospective impact of this action on the broader crypto market has sparked discussions. Related Reading: XRP Set For A ‘Life-Changing’ Month? Expert Sees $27 Incoming Bitcoin Movement: Details Of The Transfer According to blockchain research by Arkham Intelligence published on March 11, Mt. Gox made two notable Bitcoin transactions. The first transaction consisted of the 11, 501.58 BTC (about $905 million) being sent to an unknown wallet. The second transaction consisted of the transfer of 332 BTC (about $26.1 million) to a hot wallet. Context And Background This recent activity is the result of a succession of significant transactions by Mt. Gox. On March 6, the exchange transmitted more than $1 billion in Bitcoin to a wallet assigned the name “1Mo1n.” The most recent transfers were initiated by the same wallet, which is now acknowledged as an official Mt. Gox address. The current value of Mt. Gox’s holdings is approximately $2.85 billion, with an estimated 35,915 BTC. Market Consequences Historically, investors have expressed apprehension regarding the potential for sell-offs of substantial Bitcoin quantities from Mt. Gox, which could potentially lower the price of the flagship crypto. Nevertheless, the market’s immediate response to these recent transfers has been lackluster, indicating that the market may have already factored in these events or that the actual sale of these assets has not yet taken place. A Look Back At Mt. Gox’s History At one point, Mt. Gox handled up to 80% of all Bitcoin transactions worldwide, making it the biggest Bitcoin exchange in the world. The platform experienced a significant security breach between 2011 and 2014, which led to the loss of about 850,000 Bitcoin, which was worth about $500 million at the time. The exchange filed for bankruptcy as a result of this incident, leaving thousands of creditors in a precarious financial – and even psychological – situation. There have been attempts to pay back creditors in recent years. This restitution process includes the recovered funds, including the Bitcoins that are moving right now. The cryptocurrency community keeps a careful eye on the timing and format of these reimbursements since they have the ability to affect market dynamics.

For instance, the February 2025 hack on the Bybit exchange resulted in the theft of $1.5 billion worth of Ether tokens, making it one of the largest cryptocurrency thefts to date. The most recent $931 million Bitcoin transfer from Mt. Gox has spurred fresh discussions about the security and feasibility of cryptocurrency exchanges. Despite the scenario’s apparent lack of immediate market impact, it serves as a warning of the dangers and complexity inherent in the digital asset space.

Gagnon said during a Bloomberg TV interview on March 11 that both the US and Canada have been energy-driven economies for more than 200 years. Blessed with easy access to affordable power has been a key driver of economic growth over the past two centuries. However, he explained that the ongoing trade tensions and tariffs could have downstream effects on the energy markets, which are critical for Bitcoin mining . “All of our sites are based in Quebec,” Gagnon said. “The largest sites are going to be in Quebec and Alberta, followed by British Columbia. Ontario, on the other hand, isn’t as attractive due to its weaker energy market and reduced capacity.” Despite the political tension between Washington and Ottawa showing no immediate signs of easing, Gagnon believes that greater access to electricity markets and regulatory support will be crucial for the mining sector’s long-term success. He emphasized the need for deregulation and smooth market operations to allow miners to continue expanding their businesses. Strategic acquisitions strengthen market position Bitfarms has been busy in strengthening its market position through strategic acquisitions that allows for better geographical diversity that takes advantage of access to energy. “We’ve transitioned from being 40% based in North America with 6% in the US, to becoming 80% based in North America with 66% in the US,” Gagnon stated. “This shift opens up a world of opportunities for us, improving both the quality and cost structure of our operations.” Gagnon also explained that the shift in energy infrastructure from industrial use to Bitcoin mining is creating new growth opportunities. “For the last four or five years, Bitcoin miners have been investing in energy infrastructure that was previously used for industries like aluminum smelting. As the pendulum swings back toward North America, those assets are now in high demand,” he said. Regulatory uncertainty remains a challenge While Gagnon remains bullish on the future of the Bitcoin mining industry, he noted that current regulatory uncertainty remains an ongoing concern, although prospects are indeed improving. He noted that President Trump’s recent moves, including discussions about a strategic Bitcoin reserve, signal at the very least growing recognition of Bitcoin’s role in the economy. But, greater clarity on energy and crypto regulations are key to creating even greater opportunities for growth. “We need greater access to electricity markets and a supportive policy framework to drive long-term success,” he added.",News|Bitcoin|Mining,EN,0,0,BTC|MINING|MARKET|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-03-11 20:11:43

Memecoins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu lack real-world utility and are primarily driven by hype, making investors look for more utility-driven projects. What makes BinoFi stand out among memecoins is its goal to revolutionize crypto trading and investing. The platform is unveiling a new hybrid crypto exchange mechanism that brings useful decentralized features to centralized exchange users. Its hybrid liquidity model allows users to execute trades through order books from centralized exchanges. The model attracts institutional investors who are constantly on the lookout for crypto exchanges with conducive trading environments, such as instant executions and low slippage. SHIB and DOGE have been debated over time as lasting memecoins suggesting a long reign in the market. However, recent market data shows investors are growing hesitant and skeptical about memecoin investments. Experts believe investors have shifted their investment approach from trending assets to high-utility projects. BinoFi offers solutions currently needed in elevating crypto trading between CEXs and DEXs. Why BinoFi Stands out Among Top Memecoins External factors normally drive the prices of memecoins, such as SHIB and DOGE. However, utility projects like BinoFi have more stability especially during harsh market conditions. BinoFi’s advantageous features that allow crypto traders to navigate the DeFi ecosystem through different blockchains. Among the features that enable this blockchain interoperability in BinoFi’s ecosystem is its cross-chain trading model. Market experts predict a rally that might boost BINO’s price by more than 5000% before the start of Q4 2025. The project is committed to transparency and accountability. The developers provide real-time on-chain proof of reserve to prevent liquidity crises and insolvency risks. Identity verification serves as a critical component for exchanges. BinoFi is changing how exchanges verify users’ identity. The protocol leverages a Zero-Knowledge (ZK) KYC technological solution that upholds user privacy by allowing users to verify their identity without revealing personal information. This mechanism makes the hybrid exchange compliant with regulatory standards while preserving user privacy. As more and more people are looking for alternatives to memecoins such as SHIB and DOGE to boost their portfolios, Investing in BinoFi’s native token presale currently priced at $0.02, would serve as a profitable venture for long-term crypto enthusiasts.

This time, the spotlight is on OKX, a major crypto exchange, and allegations that it facilitated the laundering of a staggering $100 million in cryptocurrency pilfered from Bybit. Bloomberg’s report citing European regulatory investigations has ignited a firestorm, drawing attention to OKX’s Web3 services and the fundamental question of user responsibility in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. But hold on, because OKX CEO Mingxing Xu isn’t taking these accusations lying down. He’s come out swinging, vehemently refuting every claim and setting the record straight. Let’s dive deep into this unfolding saga and dissect the truth behind the headlines. Decoding the Allegations: Did OKX Facilitate Money Laundering? The core of the controversy revolves around the claim that OKX’s Web3 wallet service was exploited to launder a massive sum of $100 million stolen from Bybit. Bloomberg’s report suggests that European regulators are scrutinizing OKX’s role in this alleged money laundering scheme. This accusation immediately raises critical questions: What exactly is the nature of these allegations? Is OKX’s Web3 wallet truly a self-custody solution, as is generally understood in the crypto space? Did OKX knowingly or unknowingly provide a platform for illicit activities? CEO Mingxing Xu has unequivocally denied these accusations, stating that OKX has “never helped Bybit hackers launder money.” He emphasizes that the OKX Web3 wallet is not merely self-custody software but a broader ecosystem offering various APIs and services. This distinction is crucial in understanding OKX’s defense. The CEO’s Powerful Defense: Setting the Record Straight on OKX and Bybit Mingxing Xu’s response is not just a simple denial; it’s a detailed explanation aimed at dispelling misconceptions and clarifying OKX’s position. He argues that the situation is more nuanced than a straightforward case of facilitating money laundering . Here’s a breakdown of Xu’s key points: Bybit’s Use of OKX Infrastructure: Xu claims that Bybit utilized OKX’s wallet and DEX APIs to construct its own Web3 wallet and decentralized exchange infrastructure. This implies a technological partnership where Bybit leveraged OKX’s existing tools. Post-Hack Collaboration: Following the crypto hack at Bybit, Xu asserts that OKX actively collaborated with Bybit, offering technical support to address the situation. This highlights a cooperative approach rather than a complicit one. Self-Custody Clarification: Xu’s statement subtly challenges the simplistic view of Web3 wallets as purely self-custodial. He suggests that the integration of APIs and third-party services can blur the lines of pure self-custody, particularly when platforms like Bybit build upon existing infrastructures. This defense strategy pivots on portraying OKX not as a facilitator of illicit activity, but as a technology provider and a cooperative partner assisting Bybit in the aftermath of a security breach. The narrative shifts from accusation to clarification of technical relationships and post-incident support. Unpacking the Web3 Wallet Debate: Self-Custody or Shared Responsibility? The heart of this controversy touches upon the fundamental principles of Web3 wallet technology and self-custody. In the traditional crypto ethos, self-custody implies complete user control and responsibility over their digital assets. However, Xu’s statement introduces a layer of complexity. Is it truly “self-custody” when a platform like Bybit builds its wallet infrastructure using APIs provided by another exchange like OKX? Here are some critical aspects to consider in the self-custody debate: Aspect Self-Custody (Traditional View) Nuanced View (Considering API Integration) Control of Private Keys Users have exclusive control Users have primary control, but infrastructure relies on external APIs Responsibility for Security Solely user responsibility Shared responsibility; user for key management, platform for API security Platform Involvement Minimal platform involvement Platform provides underlying technology and APIs Transparency High transparency regarding asset control Transparency needed regarding API dependencies and data flow This nuanced view suggests that the term “self-custody” in the context of integrated Web3 services might require re-evaluation. The level of decentralization and user control can vary depending on the degree of API integration and platform dependencies. The Shadow of Crypto Hacks: A Persistent Threat in the Digital Asset Space The Bybit crypto hack , which triggered this entire controversy, underscores a stark reality: cybersecurity threats are a constant and evolving challenge in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Hacks, exploits, and vulnerabilities are unfortunately commonplace, leading to significant financial losses and eroding user trust. Here’s a snapshot of the persistent challenges posed by crypto hacks: Sophistication of Attacks: Hackers are becoming increasingly sophisticated, employing advanced techniques to breach security measures. DeFi Vulnerabilities: Decentralized Finance platforms, while innovative, often present new attack vectors due to the complexity of smart contracts and protocols. Lack of Regulation: The relatively nascent and often unregulated nature of the crypto space can make it challenging to追蹤 and prosecute cybercriminals. User Error: Despite technological advancements, user errors, such as poor key management or phishing scams, remain a significant point of vulnerability. The incident involving Bybit and the subsequent allegations against OKX serve as a stark reminder of the ongoing need for robust security measures, proactive threat detection, and industry-wide collaboration to combat cybercrime in the crypto domain. Navigating Regulatory Scrutiny: The Future of Crypto Exchanges and Compliance The European regulatory investigation into OKX highlights the increasing scrutiny that cryptocurrency exchanges are facing globally. As the crypto market matures and becomes more integrated into the mainstream financial system, regulators worldwide are stepping up their efforts to ensure compliance, combat illicit activities, and protect consumers. This regulatory pressure brings both challenges and opportunities for crypto exchanges: Enhanced Compliance Costs: Meeting stringent regulatory requirements can be expensive and resource-intensive for exchanges. Operational Adjustments: Exchanges may need to adapt their operational models and service offerings to align with regulatory frameworks. Increased Transparency: Regulations often mandate greater transparency in operations, user verification, and transaction monitoring. Legitimacy and Trust: Compliance with regulations can enhance the legitimacy of crypto exchanges and build greater trust among users and institutions. Market Access: Adherence to regulatory standards can pave the way for wider market access and integration with traditional financial systems. For OKX and other major exchanges, navigating this evolving regulatory landscape is paramount. Proactive engagement with regulators, robust compliance programs, and a commitment to security and transparency are essential for long-term sustainability and growth in the crypto industry. Conclusion: Truth, Trust, and Transparency in the Crypto Crossfire The allegations against OKX and CEO Mingxing Xu’s forceful denial have thrown a spotlight on the intricate relationships within the crypto ecosystem, the complexities of Web3 technologies, and the ever-present challenges of security and regulation. While the truth behind the specific allegations is still unfolding, this episode serves as a crucial reminder of the importance of transparency, robust security practices, and clear communication in the crypto space. For users, it underscores the need to understand the nuances of self-custody and the potential risks associated with different types of wallets and platforms. For exchanges, it highlights the imperative of proactive compliance, robust security measures, and clear communication about their technologies and partnerships. As the crypto industry continues to evolve, these principles of truth, trust, and transparency will be paramount in fostering a sustainable and secure future.

With Trump’s long history of attacking the U.S. justice system, many of these convicts see an opportunity to cast themselves as victims in a system they claim is as corrupt as the one that jailed them. Among the high-profile names making their pleas for mercy are Sam Bankman-Fried, Bob Menendez, Roger Ver, and Joby Weeks, along with a long list of fraudsters, tax evaders, and exiled businessmen. Some are openly appealing to Trump’s grievances, while others are offering political ammunition in exchange for freedom, according to an editorial from Politico today. Crypto felons gamble on Trump’s mercy One group watching Trump’s pardon decisions closely is the crypto community. When Trump issued a week-one pardon to Ross Ulbricht, the creator of Silk Road, it sent a clear message that crypto-related cases were on his radar, so of course now other crypto figures are hoping for a similar outcome. Joby Weeks, a Bitcoin miner, is one of them. Weeks pleaded guilty in 2020 to tax evasion and running an unregistered securities offering linked to his crypto dealings, and he has been awaiting sentencing ever since, as federal prosecutors continue to build a wider conspiracy case. But instead of waiting quietly, Weeks fired his high-powered attorney David Boies last week and is now representing himself. Weeks filed his own motion to dismiss his case, but instead of using standard legal arguments, he invoked Trump’s words directly. His motion, sent to Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi, started with: “President Trump said to ‘FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT!’ And so, I am.” Speaking from house arrest in Denver, Weeks told reporters he was hoping for direct intervention. “It would be great to have Trump step in and say, ‘Enough is enough,’” he said. Then we got Roger Ver, better known as “Bitcoin Jesus,” who is also pushing for a pardon. Roger is a former U.S. citizen turned Caribbean national who was indicted in April 2024 for evading $50 million in taxes and was arrested in Spain, where he remains fighting extradition to the U.S. Roger, like many of the others, has chosen a media strategy over a legal one. He sat down with Tucker Carlson in December, saying: “To be honest, I think they’re not really angry about taxes at all. I think they’re just angry about my lack of obedience and lack of kissing their ring.” Roger’s supporters have launched a campaign similar to the one that secured Ross’ pardon. A #FreeRogerVer movement has taken over social media, complete with a petition, a memecoin, and endorsements from Trump allies like Alex Jones and Roger Stone. Four days after Ross pardon, Roger posted a direct appeal to Trump on X: “If there’s anybody that knows what it’s like to be the victim of lawfare for spreading American ideals, it’s Donald Trump.” Meanwhile, Ross himself has advocated for the release of Roger. Bankman-Fried, Menendez, and political convicts line up Sam “SBF” Bankman-Fried, the former FTX CEO, is another name circulating in pardon discussions. Sentenced to 25 years in prison for fraud, SBF has remained active behind bars, working through his parents and legal team to explore a clemency deal. According to Bloomberg, Bankman-Fried’s mother, Barbara Fried, and his former attorney, Marc Mukasey, have been quietly pushing for options, and SBF himself has made his position clear. In a recent New York Sun interview, he attacked Judge Lewis Kaplan, who oversaw his trial. Kaplan was also the judge who ruled against Trump in the E. Jean Carroll defamation case, making him an easy choice for a pardon plea. “I know President Trump had a lot of frustrations with Judge Kaplan,” Bankman-Fried said. “I certainly did as well.” SBF has also gone on Tucker Carlson to basically say he was afraid he’s gonna die in prison by the time he’s 40. SBF is 33 right now. On the political side, Bob Menendez is also hoping for clemency. The former senator, convicted of bribery and corruption, was sentenced to 11 years in prison. Outside the Manhattan courthouse where he received his sentence, he declared: “President Trump is right. This process is political and it’s corrupted to the core.” Menendez later tagged @RealDonaldTrump on X, making his intentions clear, but unlike President Trump, Menendez is a proud Bitcoin hater. He harassed El Salvador’s president Nayib Bukele for years over his decision to adopt Bitcoin on a federal level. After his arrest, Nayib kept trolling him on X, as Menendez was found with loads of cash and gold in his home. Nayibe jokingly said that he should’ve taken those bribes in Bitcoin, cause then all he’d need would be a flash drive for his cold wallet. Anyway, at the US local government level, Trayon White, a former D.C. council member, is fighting federal bribery charges. White has accused the FBI of setting him up and even appeared at a Senate hearing for Kash Patel, Trump’s pick to lead the FBI. “I’m glad to hear the potential director say he will be fair and just. This is what America wants,” White posted on Instagram. Supporters have rented a truck to sit outside D.C. Council headquarters, displaying a massive image of White and a message: “FBI set me up.” Ekim Alptekin offers Biden dirt for a pardon Ekim Alptekin, a Turkish businessman facing indictment, is taking a different approach. He’s offering information in exchange for clemency. In an audio broadcast on X, Alptekin claimed that in 2019, Jim Biden and Sara Biden—Joe Biden’s brother and sister-in-law—visited him in Turkey. According to Alptekin, they offered to help his legal case if he hired former Attorney General Eric Holder for $3 million. Alptekin says he believes the real goal was to get him to implicate Michael Flynn, Trump’s former National Security Adviser, in wrongdoing. Now, he wants to share his story, but with a condition: “I would prefer the case to be dismissed. I’ll settle for a pardon for the sake of my family.” Representatives for Jim and Sara Biden did not respond to requests for comment. George Santos stays quiet on a pardon One name surprisingly absent from the pardon-seeking frenzy is George Santos. The former congressman, convicted of fraud and identity theft, is awaiting sentencing in April. Asked if he would seek a pardon, Santos responded: “I’m the worst advocate for myself, so I have no words for your article,” he said. “I’m sorry.” While others openly lobby for Trump’s mercy, Santos remains one of the few still on the sidelines. Trump’s return to office has triggered a wave of pardon requests, and according to Sam Mangel, a consultant for white-collar criminals, the demand is off the charts. “Before Trump, I got two inquiries per year. Now I’m getting two to four per day. The level of interest is unheard of,” Mangel said. With Trump’s new pardon czar, Alice Johnson, now in charge, the list of potential beneficiaries is growing daily. Whether Trump will grant them all clemency remains to be seen, but for now, the line keeps getting longer. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially acknowledged Grayscale Investments’ filing for a spot Hedera (HBAR) Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). This exciting news, first reported by Cointelegraph on X, signals a significant step forward for Hedera and the broader cryptocurrency market. But what does this acknowledgement really mean, and what could it mean for investors interested in a Spot Hedera ETF ? What Does the SEC Acknowledgment of the Hedera ETF Filing Mean? When the SEC acknowledges a filing, it essentially confirms that they have received and registered the document. This is the initial, but crucial, step in the ETF approval process. It doesn’t guarantee approval, but it’s a necessary prerequisite. Think of it like this: filing is like submitting your application, and acknowledgment is the admissions office confirming they’ve received it and will start reviewing. Here’s a breakdown of what this acknowledgment signifies: Official Start of Review: The SEC’s acknowledgment officially kicks off the formal review process for Grayscale’s Hedera ETF proposal. This means the clock is ticking, and the SEC will now delve into the details of the filing. Transparency and Progress: This public acknowledgment indicates transparency and progress in the regulatory dialogue between Grayscale and the SEC regarding cryptocurrency investment products. Market Confidence Boost: The news can inject optimism into the market, signaling to investors that regulated crypto investment vehicles are continuing to move forward, despite previous regulatory hurdles. However, it’s vital to remember that acknowledgment is not approval. The SEC will now conduct a thorough review, which involves analyzing various aspects of the proposed HBAR ETF . Why is a Spot Hedera ETF a Big Deal? The potential launch of a spot Hedera ETF is a monumental event for several reasons. Let’s unpack why this is generating so much buzz: Direct Exposure to HBAR: A spot ETF directly holds the underlying asset – in this case, Hedera (HBAR). This is different from futures-based ETFs, which track futures contracts and not the actual cryptocurrency. Spot ETFs are generally considered more desirable by investors seeking direct exposure. Increased Accessibility: ETFs make investing in cryptocurrencies like HBAR significantly more accessible to a broader range of investors, particularly institutional investors and those who prefer traditional investment vehicles. You don’t need to navigate crypto exchanges or manage private keys; you can invest through your brokerage account. Legitimacy and Mainstream Adoption: Approval of a spot HBAR ETF would further legitimize Hedera and the entire crypto asset class in the eyes of traditional finance. It signals growing acceptance and integration into mainstream investment portfolios. Potential Price Impact: Historically, the launch of crypto ETFs has often been associated with positive price movements in the underlying asset due to increased demand and accessibility. A successful Grayscale Hedera ETF could potentially drive demand for HBAR. Grayscale and Hedera: A Powerful Combination for a Spot ETF? Grayscale Investments is a leading digital asset manager with a proven track record in the crypto ETF space. They were instrumental in the launch of Bitcoin ETFs and are now setting their sights on Hedera. Why is this partnership significant for a Grayscale Hedera ETF ? Grayscale’s Expertise: Grayscale brings deep expertise in navigating the complex regulatory landscape of crypto ETFs. Their experience with previous ETF filings and approvals is invaluable. Hedera’s Technology: Hedera Hashgraph is known for its speed, security, and energy efficiency. Its enterprise-grade distributed ledger technology is attracting significant attention from businesses and institutions. This strong technological foundation makes HBAR a compelling asset for an ETF. Growing Institutional Interest in Hedera: Hedera’s focus on enterprise solutions and its partnerships with major global organizations are attracting increasing institutional interest. A Grayscale Hedera ETF could tap into this growing demand. Challenges and Considerations for SEC Approval of a Spot HBAR ETF While the SEC acknowledgment is encouraging, the path to full approval for a spot SEC Hedera ETF is not without its challenges. What hurdles might Grayscale need to overcome? Challenge Description Market Surveillance Concerns The SEC has consistently raised concerns about market manipulation and the need for robust surveillance sharing agreements with exchanges trading the underlying crypto asset. Custody and Security Ensuring the secure custody and storage of HBAR assets within the ETF structure is paramount for investor protection and SEC compliance. Regulatory Uncertainty The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Changes in regulations or interpretations could impact the approval process. Novelty of HBAR ETF While Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs exist, a spot ETF for Hedera is a relatively new concept. The SEC may require more time to assess its unique characteristics and risks. Actionable Insights: What Should Investors Do Now? The SEC’s acknowledgment of the Grayscale Hedera ETF filing presents both opportunities and uncertainties for investors. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on developments related to the HBAR ETF filing. Follow reputable crypto news sources and regulatory updates. Do Your Research: Understand Hedera (HBAR), its technology, and its potential. Assess whether it aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance. Manage Expectations: Remember that SEC acknowledgment is not approval. The review process can take time, and approval is not guaranteed. Consider Diversification: ETFs can be a good way to diversify your crypto portfolio. However, always consider your overall portfolio allocation and risk management strategy. Consult a Financial Advisor: If you are unsure about investing in crypto ETFs or Hedera, seek advice from a qualified financial advisor. The Future of Crypto ETFs and Hedera The SEC’s movement on the Grayscale Hedera ETF is a promising sign for the future of crypto ETFs and the broader adoption of digital assets. It indicates a potential shift towards greater regulatory clarity and acceptance of cryptocurrency investment products. If approved, a spot HBAR ETF could pave the way for ETFs based on other altcoins, further expanding investment options for both retail and institutional investors. The journey of the Grayscale Hedera ETF is just beginning, but the initial acknowledgment from the SEC is undoubtedly a significant milestone. It’s a development that crypto enthusiasts and investors alike will be watching closely. Will this be the breakthrough that opens the floodgates for more diverse crypto ETFs? Only time will tell, but the signs are undeniably optimistic.

The projection from the analyst AM_Panic comes as the broader cryptocurrency sector witnesses a massive downturn spearheaded by Bitcoin (BTC). 3 Scenarios Favoring Cardano Over Solana The analyst began by acknowledging Cardano’s accelerated growth, including plans to enhance its scalability. He noted on X that a potential ADA price surge largely depends on Cardano’s capacity to implement its scalability plans. Should the network achieve this feat, it may attract more Decentralized Applications (dApps), which will benefit the blockchain and help it outrank Solana. In the second scenario, the analyst expects that any setback or regulatory challenge to the Solana network will negatively impact its price. If it records a 20% price dip, this would affect its market cap, which is currently at $50.11 billion. A 20% fall can raise the market cap to $50.11 billion, making it easier for Cardano to meet continued growth. The last scenario is tied to favorable market conditions. Once there are either bullish crypto trends or more regulatory clarity, especially with Donald Trump as President, Cardano may benefit more. The market analyst believes the Layer-1 blockchain is even better if positioned as a stable, research-driven alternative. The Solana Memecoin Woes In recent weeks, Solana has faced several woes, ranging from a slowdown in token growth within its network to its price drawdown. Solana Powerhouse Pump.Fun, known as the source of the ecosystem boom over the past few months, has recorded a slowdown in adoption. From abuse by creators to a shift from risk-on assets amid the global stock market meltdown, Solana’s price has experienced more drawbacks. Most critics also warn that Solana is sacrificing decentralization for speed, fueling boycott concerns in the long term. Price Outlook for Cardano and Solana The ADA price is $0.7302 after recording a 24-hour price gain of 6.52%. SOL trades at $127.62, corresponding to a 7.31% increase within the last 24 hours. Notably, several analysts are optimistic that the coin will see better days. Market analyst Crypto Jobs, in SOL price analysis , shows how the coin fluctuated between $153 and $138, suggesting a season of indecision in the crypto market. While analysts have predicted that the coin’s price may hit $200 soon and even reach higher levels, there are at least three reasons why it may not attain this level in March.

Bitcoin (BTC) is under significant market pressure, with traders watching its next move closely. Meanwhile, Sonic is making waves in Web3, expanding its ecosystem and positioning itself for long-term growth. But one project is standing far above the rest—Qubetics ($TICS). With its revolutionary QubeQode IDE, a powerful tool for blockchain development, and a record-breaking presale that just crossed $14.9 million, Qubetics is easily one of the top crypto coins to buy now . Let’s break down why this project is gaining massive traction while Bitcoin and Sonic make their latest moves. Qubetics ($TICS) – The Best Crypto to Buy Now with QubeQode IDE The Web3 development space is exploding, but building on blockchain is still way too complicated for most people. Enter Qubetics , a game-changer in the crypto world that is breaking down barriers with its all-in-one QubeQode IDE. QubeQode IDE is designed for developers, businesses, and even non-technical users, offering a simple yet powerful way to create smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) across multiple blockchains. With drag-and-drop functionality, built-in security audits, and AI-powered automation, QubeQode is redefining blockchain development—making it faster, cheaper, and more accessible than ever. For businesses, this is a breakthrough. Imagine a startup launching a new DeFi project without hiring an entire blockchain dev team. Or a gaming company integrating NFTs across multiple chains without weeks of coding headaches. With QubeQode, these scenarios are now possible, making Qubetics one of the top crypto coins to buy now. Qubetics Presale: Massive Demand and a Limited Window for Entry Qubetics is currently in presale stage 25, with $TICS priced at just $0.1074. But here’s the catch—every Sunday at midnight, the price jumps by 10%, making early participation a huge advantage. Here’s what analysts are saying about Qubetics’ ROI potential: 132.66% ROI at $0.25 (presale end price) 830.65% ROI at $1 post-presale 4,553.26% ROI at $5 9,206.51% ROI at $10 after the mainnet launch 13,859.77% ROI at $15 with full adoption If you invest $1,000 today, and $TICS reaches $10, that’s a jaw-dropping $92,065 return. And if it hits $15, you’re sitting on $138,597. This is why Qubetics is widely regarded as one of the top crypto coins to buy now—but only for those who get in before the next price jump. Bitcoin Faces Market Pressure as Supply Dynamics Shift Bitcoin, the king of crypto, has been facing significant market pressure, with recent price action showing signs of uncertainty. Analysts point to a shift in supply dynamics, which could lead to increased price volatility in the coming months. Reports indicate that major Bitcoin holders are starting to adjust their positions, leading to fluctuations in supply distribution. While some see this as a sign of potential corrections, others argue that Bitcoin remains a long-term powerhouse—especially with upcoming developments like the Bitcoin ETF expansion and institutional adoption. Despite the short-term pressure, Bitcoin’s fundamentals remain strong. Institutional interest is still growing, and with more adoption coming in 2025, BTC could still be on track for a strong recovery. However, short-term traders are keeping a close eye on supply trends, as market swings could create opportunities—or risks—depending on how Bitcoin responds. Sonic Gains Traction with New Web3 Developments Sonic has been gaining momentum in the Web3 space, as its ecosystem expansion continues. The project has been focusing on infrastructure improvements, aiming to create a seamless user experience for dApps and blockchain-based applications. Recent updates highlight Sonic’s growing partnerships and integrations, which are fueling excitement among its community members. With a strong roadmap ahead, Sonic is being seen as a long-term Web3 player, capable of bridging gaps in blockchain usability. The project’s ability to attract new developers and integrate with existing blockchain networks has positioned it as a serious contender in the decentralized ecosystem. If Sonic continues to deliver on its promises, it could see substantial growth leading into 2025. Conclusion: Qubetics Leads as the Best Crypto to Buy Now! This week’s market action highlights three key trends—Bitcoin is facing supply-driven market pressure, Sonic is expanding its Web3 footprint, and Qubetics is absolutely dominating with its crypto presale success. With its cutting-edge QubeQode IDE, insane growth potential, and record-breaking presale numbers, Qubetics is hands-down the best crypto to buy now. The crypto presale is moving fast, and with a 10% price hike every Sunday, the best time to join the Qubetics presale is right now—before the next price surge!

The crypto world is buzzing with electrifying news that could potentially catapult Dogecoin into the mainstream investment arena. According to a recent post by Taletrader on X, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially acknowledged receiving a filing from Bitwise for a Dogecoin ETF . Yes, you read that right – a dedicated exchange-traded fund focused solely on the meme-turned-major cryptocurrency, Dogecoin! This development is a significant leap for DOGE, and it’s got everyone in the crypto community talking. But what does this filing really mean, and could this be the game-changer Dogecoin has been waiting for? What is a Dogecoin ETF and Why is it a Big Deal? For those new to the ETF world, let’s break it down. An Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) is essentially a type of investment fund that trades on stock exchanges, much like individual stocks. A Dogecoin ETF , if approved, would track the price of Dogecoin and allow investors to gain exposure to DOGE without directly holding the cryptocurrency itself. Think of it as investing in Dogecoin through a regulated and traditional investment vehicle. Why is this significant? Here’s why a DOGE ETF is making waves: Accessibility for Mainstream Investors: ETFs are incredibly accessible. They are traded on traditional stock exchanges and can be easily bought and sold through brokerage accounts that millions already use. This opens the door for a massive influx of retail and institutional investors who might have been hesitant to navigate the complexities of crypto exchanges and wallets to invest in Dogecoin directly. Increased Legitimacy and Regulatory Comfort: An SEC-approved ETF lends a significant layer of legitimacy to Dogecoin. It signals that regulatory bodies are becoming more comfortable with crypto assets, and specifically, with Dogecoin as an investment vehicle. This could alleviate concerns some investors have about the perceived risk and unregulated nature of cryptocurrencies. Potential for Institutional Investment: Many institutional investors are restricted from directly investing in cryptocurrencies. However, they are often permitted to invest in ETFs. A Bitwise Dogecoin ETF could pave the way for institutional capital to flow into Dogecoin, potentially driving up demand and price. Simplified Investment Process: Investing in a crypto ETF is far simpler than buying and storing actual Dogecoin. Investors don’t need to worry about private keys, wallets, or the security risks associated with holding cryptocurrency directly. This ease of access can attract a broader investor base. Bitwise Leading the Charge: Who Are They? [img src=”image-path-placeholder.jpg” alt=”Bitwise Dogecoin ETF Filing”] Bitwise Asset Management has filed for a Dogecoin ETF. Bitwise Asset Management is not new to the crypto ETF game. They are a well-known and respected firm in the digital asset space, specializing in crypto investment products. They have been at the forefront of pushing for crypto ETFs and have a track record of launching innovative crypto investment solutions. Their involvement in filing for a Dogecoin ETF adds credibility to the endeavor and suggests they see significant potential in a DOGE-focused investment product. Bitwise’s existing suite of crypto ETFs includes products focused on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and broader crypto indexes. Their expertise and experience in navigating the regulatory landscape are crucial in the often complex and lengthy SEC approval process. What are the Potential Benefits of a Dogecoin ETF? Beyond accessibility and legitimacy, a Dogecoin ETF could unlock a range of benefits for the Dogecoin ecosystem and the broader crypto market: Price Discovery and Market Efficiency: An ETF can enhance price discovery for Dogecoin by providing a regulated and transparent trading venue. This can lead to a more efficient and stable market for DOGE. Increased Trading Volume and Liquidity: ETFs typically attract significant trading volume. A DOGE ETF could dramatically increase the liquidity of Dogecoin, making it easier for investors to buy and sell DOGE without significantly impacting the price. Diversification for Crypto Portfolios: For investors already involved in crypto, a Dogecoin ETF offers another avenue for diversification. It allows them to allocate a portion of their portfolio to DOGE within a familiar ETF structure. Potential for Derivatives and Options Markets: The approval of a Dogecoin ETF could pave the way for the development of related derivatives and options markets for DOGE, further maturing the Dogecoin ecosystem. Are There Challenges and Roadblocks Ahead for the Dogecoin ETF? While the Dogecoin ETF filing is exciting, it’s important to acknowledge that the path to approval is not guaranteed and comes with its own set of challenges: SEC Scrutiny and Approval Process: The SEC has a rigorous review process for ETFs, especially those related to cryptocurrencies. They will thoroughly examine Bitwise’s filing, considering factors like market manipulation risks, investor protection, and the underlying nature of Dogecoin. SEC approval is not a given, and the process can take considerable time. Dogecoin’s Volatility and Meme Coin Status: Dogecoin is known for its price volatility and origins as a meme coin. The SEC might raise concerns about the inherent risks associated with investing in an asset with such characteristics. Bitwise will need to address these concerns convincingly. Market Sentiment and Regulatory Climate: The overall market sentiment towards cryptocurrencies and the evolving regulatory climate will play a role. Any negative shifts in either could impact the SEC’s decision. Competition from Other Crypto ETFs: The crypto ETF landscape is becoming increasingly competitive. While a dedicated Dogecoin ETF is unique, it will still compete for investor capital with other crypto ETFs, particularly those focused on Bitcoin and Ethereum. What’s Next? The Waiting Game Begins With the Dogecoin ETF filing confirmed by the SEC, the waiting game begins. The SEC will now commence its review process, which can involve multiple rounds of questions, amendments, and potentially public comments. There is no set timeline for SEC approval, and it could take months, or even longer, to reach a final decision. Investors and Dogecoin enthusiasts should closely monitor updates from Bitwise and the SEC. Any developments in the review process will be closely watched by the crypto community. It’s crucial to remember that filing for an ETF is just the first step; approval is the ultimate goal, and there’s no guarantee of success. Actionable Insights: What Should Dogecoin Investors Do Now? So, what should you do with this electrifying Dogecoin investment news? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with the news surrounding the Bitwise Dogecoin ETF filing. Follow reputable crypto news sources and monitor announcements from Bitwise and the SEC. Manage Expectations: While the filing is positive, remember that ETF approval is not guaranteed. Avoid making investment decisions solely based on the hope of ETF approval. Diversify Your Portfolio: As always, diversification is key. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, even with exciting developments like a potential Dogecoin ETF. Spread your investments across different asset classes. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Understand the risks and potential rewards of investing in Dogecoin and crypto ETFs. Make informed decisions based on your own research and risk tolerance. Consider Long-Term Potential: View the crypto ETF development in the context of the long-term evolution of the crypto market. ETFs represent a step towards greater mainstream adoption, which could benefit the entire crypto space, including Dogecoin. Conclusion: An Explosive Step Towards Mainstream Dogecoin? The confirmation of Bitwise’s Dogecoin ETF filing is undoubtedly a monumental moment for Dogecoin. It signifies a potential shift towards mainstream acceptance and investment accessibility for the meme-born cryptocurrency. While the road to SEC approval may be long and uncertain, the filing itself is a powerful signal of Dogecoin’s growing maturity and the increasing institutional interest in the crypto space. The crypto world watches with bated breath as the SEC embarks on its review process, hoping this exciting development will indeed pave the way for a new era of Dogecoin investment.

Leavitt’s comments echoed sentiments expressed by President Donald Trump over the weekend. Speaking on Fox News’ Sunday Morning Futures program, Trump was asked if he expected a recession in 2025. Trump responded: “I hate to predict these things. There’s a transition period, because what we’re doing is so big.” Related News: Coinbase Announces Support After Backlash For Token It Previously Announced It Would Delist Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick took a more definitive stance, telling NBC's Meet the Press, “There will be no recession in America.” But some economists are skeptical of the administration’s optimistic outlook. Stephen Henn, an assistant professor of economics at Sacred Heart University, warned that the risk of a recession in 2025 is still high. “The probability of a recession in 2025 is quite high,” Henn said, noting that economic difficulties could affect individuals differently depending on their financial situations. “If the reduction in government spending is not offset by increases in consumer spending, business investment and/or net exports, we are very likely to see a recession,” Henn added. *This is not investment advice.

It employs capped weighting and quarterly rebalancing to limit volatility. This approach signals a notable shift in corporate treasury strategies. Bitwise Asset Management has launched the Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF, trading under the ticker OWNB. The exchange-traded fund is designed to expose investors to companies holding significant Bitcoin reserves as part of their corporate treasury strategies. The ETF follows the Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Corporations Index, which tracks firms integrating Bitcoin into their financial holdings. Bitwise ETF Targets Companies Using Bitcoin as a Treasury Reserve According to Bitwise , the ETF aims to capitalize on the growing trend in which companies allocate some of their cash reserves to Bitcoin. Matt Hougan, the company’s Chief Investment Officer, stated that businesses collectively hold trillions of dollars in cash while the U.S. government runs an annual deficit exceeding $2 trillion. Today we’re launching the Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF, now trading with ticker OWNB. Over 70 companies today have adopted MSTR’s playbook of holding bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset. The Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Corporations Index holds the largest, those with… pic.twitter.com/Z7pqLGGx27 — Bitwise (@BitwiseInvest) March 11, 2025 He explained that many firms now view Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset that is both liquid and scarce. Hougan noted that companies are increasingly considering Bitcoin as an alternative store of value, independent of government monetary policies. “Companies perceive Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset that’s liquid and scarce—and not subject to the whims or money printing of any government. We think companies are only getting started here, and this ETF gives investors exposure to innovative firms at the forefront of this trend,” Hougan said. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley highlighted that more than 70 companies now hold Bitcoin in their corporate treasuries, following the example set by firms such as Strategy. He said that businesses are acquiring Bitcoin for the same reasons as individual investors, viewing it as a hedge against monetary instability. Horsley also emphasized that the ETF allows investors to gain diversified exposure to companies that have embraced Bitcoin as part of their financial strategies. OWNB tracks companies with at least 1,000 Bitcoin in their treasuries. At launch, the top holdings in the index included Strategy, MARA Holdings, CleanSpark, Riot Platforms, Boyaa Interactive, Metaplanet, Aker ASA, Bitfarms, BitFuFu, and Galaxy Digital. The index weighs holdings based on the amount of Bitcoin owned while maintaining diversification limits, including capping the largest holding at 20 percent at each rebalance. Additionally, companies with Bitcoin holdings representing less than 33 percent of their total assets receive an automatic fixed weighting of 1.5 percent. The index is rebalanced quarterly. MicroStrategy Leads Bitwise’s Bitcoin Treasury ETF with 20.87% Allocation At launch, Strategy held the largest allocation in the index at 20.87%. Bitcoin mining firm MARA Holdings accounted for 12.12%, while CleanSpark and Riot Platforms, both mining-focused companies, represented 6.26% and 6.23%, respectively. The index also includes companies outside the U.S., with China-based Boyaa Interactive at 5.75% and Japan’s Metaplanet at 5.25%. Norwegian industrial investment firm Aker ASA held 4.63%, while Bitcoin mining firms Bitfarms and BitFuFu had 4.30% and 4.03%, respectively. Financial services firm Galaxy Digital rounded out the top holdings with 3.99%. Bitwise stated that the ETF will not invest in Bitcoin directly or through derivatives but instead seeks to capture the financial performance of corporations with significant Bitcoin exposure. The index is rebalanced quarterly to maintain its structure. The firm reported that as of the third quarter of 2024, U.S. nonfinancial corporations collectively held over $4.5 trillion in cash and deposits and nearly $1 trillion in U.S. Treasuries. Bitwise suggested that these cash reserves are a key reason companies are turning to Bitcoin as an alternative asset. As it stands now, it is clear that the newly launched ETF is part of Bitwise’s broader strategy to provide regulated exposure to Bitcoin through financial products. To provide an additional layer of transparency, the fund is distributed by Foreside Fund Services, which is not affiliated with Bitwise or its subsidiaries. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Why are companies holding Bitcoin? Many companies now hold Bitcoin to hedge against inflation and boost returns beyond low-yield cash. This marks a broader shift toward diversified, digital treasury strategies. How does the ETF manage risk? The ETF caps exposure for each firm and rebalances quarterly. This strategy limits volatility while giving investors steady access to companies pursuing Bitcoin-based treasury methods. What could corporate Bitcoin adoption mean for finance? Widespread adoption may spur regulatory updates and reshape treasury practices. This trend could redefine liquidity management and risk mitigation in today’s uncertain economic climate.

You Might Get a Second Chance,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/missed-entry-on-presidential-memecoins-you-might-get-a-second-chance,"The explosive rise of presidential memecoins has created once-in-a-lifetime opportunities for early adopters. Traders who secured early positions in tokens like $TRUMP and $LIBRA have seen astronomical returns, with some wallets flipping modest investments into millions. However, the harsh reality is that these gains are often reserved for insiders who gain access to tokens at launch prices before retail traders even have a chance to participate. The result? A rigged game where insiders rake in massive profits while everyday traders are left holding the bag. If you’ve been in the crypto space long enough, you already know that the biggest gains happen at the beginning of presidential memecoin launches, and with the value exploding in value within hours, the most profitable traders aren’t the ones who buy after the hype starts—they’re the ones who get in on the ground floor. Take for example $TRUMP, which quickly gained traction among traders capitalizing on political speculation. One early investor who entered at sub-$0.01 prices saw their holdings surge over 900%, turning a $5,000 investment into over $1 million in a matter of days. Then there’s the $LIBRA Token - inspired by Argentine President Javier Milei, $LIBRA saw an even more extreme pump. Some wallets managed to flip their holdings for over $10 million in profit within the first 48 hours of trading. Here’s the catch: in both cases, insiders and early-access traders were the ones securing these life-changing profits. Regular traders who entered even minutes after the launch were already buying at a significant premium, leaving them at a major disadvantage. How Insider Trading Ruins Presidential Memecoin Launches The problem isn’t just that early investors make big profits—it’s that these “early investors” are often insiders who have been allocated tokens before the public even knows the launch is happening. This isn’t a fair market. It’s a system designed to enrich insiders while dumping risk onto everyday traders. This cycle is what has made so many presidential memecoin launches feel rigged. Traders looking for fair entry points are effectively being used as exit liquidity for those who were given privileged access. But that’s where Warrior Coin changes the game. Enter Political Pump, by Warrior Coin Warrior Coin is setting a new standard for presidential memecoin launches by introducing a true fair launch model, dubbed Political Pump . The platform ensures that no tokens are distributed to insiders before the public gets access, meaning every trader has an equal opportunity to enter at launch price. • Zero Insider Allocation – No pre-launch distributions, no developer wallets with a head start, and no backroom deals. • Fair Launch Pools – Investors get access to buy at the same time, ensuring an equal playing field. • Rug-Proof Launch – Once a coin completes the bonding curve, it is pooled with Warrior, Warrior Coin’s native token, and locked in the DEX for liquidity to ensure a rug-proof launch. This system eliminates the unfair advantage that insiders have traditionally exploited, allowing all traders to engage in a true free market where price discovery is organic and demand-driven rather than artificially manipulated. Don’t Miss the Next Big Presidential Memecoin Boom If you’re frustrated with missing out on early gains due to insider manipulation, Political Pump is your second chance. The next wave of presidential memecoins will still provide massive upside potential—but this time, you’ll have a fair shot at securing prices at launch. With Warrior Coin’s Political Pump, you’re no longer just chasing trends—you’re entering the market on equal footing with everyone else. The playing field is finally level, and the next million-dollar trade could be yours. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The Circle Executive shared this fact while reacting to the recent guidance by the US Office of the Comptroller of Currency (OCC). The OCC recently released a statement saying that banks can now engage in some crypto services, including stablecoins and crypto custody. While many have welcomed the move as an end to Operation Chokepoint 2.0, Hansen noted that US banks are behind their European counterpart. According to Hansen , European banks have spent the past few years building their infrastructure and expertise to serve the crypto industry and they already offer trading, staking, custody, stablecoins, payments, and banking. He said: “Europe’s banks—including multiple G-SIBs (Global Systemically Important Banks)—have spent years building infrastructure, developing expertise, and securing regulatory approvals.” Data from Coincub supports Hansen’s statement. According to a report released last year, Europe, including the UK, had the most crypto-friendly banks, with 55. Asia had 24, while North America had 23. Hansen also listed several European banks that are already offering crypto services. These include BBVA, which recently got regulatory approval in Spain to offer its clients crypto trading and custody of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Several notable banks, including Societe Generale, Santander, Standard Chartered, BNP Paribas, and Deutsche Bank, also offer crypto-related services. European Banks with Crypto Services (Source: Patrick Hansen) However, the Circle executive noted that there have been some changes to that list. Fidor Bank has already stopped operating, while SEBA is now known as AMINA Bank and no longer serves retail. Still, new banks offering crypto services have also emerged in Europe. These include Trade Republic in Germany, Bison Bank in Portugal, and Banca Intesa in Italy. Experts say EU rules responsible for Europe will lead crypto-banking for years While the recent changes in US banking policy could lead to more US banks embracing crypto, Hansen expects Europe will remain ahead for some years. He noted that this is one of the few cases where Europe has a first-mover advantage and the Market in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulations provide a chance to cement that position. This view aligns with Hansen’s earlier opinion, in which he attributed the high level of access to banking for crypto services to regulatory clarity in the region. He cited several EU regulations, including the E-Money Directive 2000, the Payment Service Directive 2007, and the MiCA in 2024, as contributing to this clarity. He wrote: “It is not because European banks are more risk-taking or innovative, but rather because EU regulations in payments and crypto are creating legal clarity, and, importantly, actively encouraging, not curtailing, competition and innovation in payments.” However, the improved regulatory clarity in the US could cause Europe to lose this advantage, especially as both regions move in different directions more recently Since President Donald Trump’s administration began on January 20, there have been sizable changes in the US regulatory approach including allowing crypto and banning central bank digital currency (CBDC). On its part, the European Central Bank (ECB) wants to introduce the digital Euro by October 2025. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

OpenAI, the powerhouse behind ChatGPT, has just dropped a game-changing suite of tools designed to let enterprises build their very own AI Agents . Imagine automated systems capable of independently tackling tasks – from deep-diving into web data to navigating complex company files. This isn’t just incremental improvement; it’s a leap towards truly autonomous business operations, powered by the same cutting-edge AI models that fuel OpenAI’s most impressive products. Unpacking OpenAI’s New AI Agents and Responses API The heart of this announcement is the Responses API, a robust framework that empowers developers to create custom AI Agents tailored to specific business needs. Think of it as an upgrade and replacement for the older Assistants API (slated to retire in early 2026). But what exactly does this mean for businesses and the future of work? Here’s a breakdown of what the Responses API brings to the table: Web Search Capabilities: Just like OpenAI’s Operator, these AI Agents can scour the web for information, conduct research, and gather real-time data. Company File Scans: Need to sift through mountains of internal documents? The Responses API allows agents to efficiently scan company files and databases, extracting crucial insights. Website Navigation: Imagine agents that can autonomously navigate websites, automate workflows, and interact with web-based applications. Essentially, OpenAI is handing over the building blocks to create applications mirroring their own advanced AI Agents like Operator and deep research. The goal? To foster a new wave of truly autonomous applications that go beyond the limitations of current AI implementations. The Power of GPT-4o API : Fueling the Next Generation of Agents Under the hood of these powerful tools lies the GPT-4o API , specifically the GPT-4o search and GPT-4o mini search models. These are the same models that power OpenAI’s ChatGPT Search, known for their impressive factual accuracy. Let’s look at why this is a significant advancement: Model SimpleQA Benchmark Score (Higher is Better) Key Feature GPT-4o search 90% High Factual Accuracy, Web Search Optimized GPT-4o mini search 88% Efficient and Accurate Web Search GPT-4.5 63% Larger, General Purpose Model (for comparison) As you can see, these search-optimized models outperform even the larger GPT-4.5 in fact-seeking tasks. This is because, in theory, these models can actively search for and verify information, leading to more reliable and accurate results. However, it’s crucial to acknowledge that even with web search integration, AI hallucinations aren’t entirely eliminated. GPT-4o API still gets around 10% of factual questions wrong, and challenges remain with short, navigational queries and citation reliability. Beyond Search: File Scanning and Computer-Using Agents for Business AI The Responses API isn’t just about web search. It’s a comprehensive toolkit for building robust Business AI solutions. Here are other key components: File Search Utility: Quickly and securely scan company databases to retrieve information. OpenAI assures that these files are not used for model training, addressing crucial data privacy concerns. Computer-Using Agent (CUA) Model: This is the engine behind OpenAI’s Operator, allowing for the automation of computer tasks. Developers can leverage the CUA model to automate data entry, streamline application workflows, and more. For enterprises with stringent security requirements, the CUA model can even be run locally. While the CUA model in Operator is currently limited to web actions, the Responses API opens doors to broader automation possibilities within business systems. Navigating the Challenges of Autonomous Systems Olivier Godemont, OpenAI’s API product head, rightly pointed out the gap between AI agent demos and real-world scalability. While showcasing an AI Agent is relatively easy, achieving consistent performance and user adoption at scale is a significant hurdle. The recent buzz (and subsequent disappointment) around Chinese startup Butterfly Effect’s Manus platform serves as a stark reminder of the challenges in delivering on the hype surrounding Autonomous Systems . Even OpenAI acknowledges that their current tools are early iterations. The CUA model, for instance, is described as “not yet highly reliable for automating tasks on operating systems” and prone to “inadvertent” errors. Shortcomings also persist in areas like: Accuracy: While improved, factual inaccuracies still occur. Navigational Queries: Handling simple, direct questions remains a challenge. Citation Reliability: Ensuring the accuracy and trustworthiness of sources is ongoing work. However, OpenAI emphasizes its commitment to continuous improvement, viewing these releases as foundational steps in the evolution of AI Agents . Agents SDK: Empowering Developers to Build Responsibly Alongside the Responses API, OpenAI is launching the Agents SDK, an open-source toolkit designed to empower developers. This SDK provides free tools for: System Integration: Seamlessly integrate AI Models with internal business systems. Safeguard Implementation: Incorporate safety measures and ethical considerations into agent development. Activity Monitoring: Track and debug agent activities for optimization and performance management. The Agents SDK builds upon OpenAI’s previous work with Swarm, a multi-agent orchestration framework, and underscores the company’s focus on responsible AI development. The Future is Agentic: Are Autonomous Systems the Next Big Thing? OpenAI’s leadership is betting big on the transformative potential of AI Agents . Godemont believes agents are “the most impactful application of AI that will happen,” echoing CEO Sam Altman’s prediction that 2025 will be the year AI Agents enter the workforce. While the timeline remains to be seen, OpenAI’s latest releases signal a clear shift from conceptual demos to practical, impactful tools for businesses. The journey to fully realized Autonomous Systems is still in its early stages, with challenges to overcome in reliability, accuracy, and scalability. However, OpenAI’s commitment to providing developers with powerful and versatile tools like the Responses API and Agents SDK suggests a future where AI Agents play an increasingly vital role in the business landscape. For cryptocurrency businesses and beyond, the ability to leverage these technologies could unlock unprecedented levels of efficiency, innovation, and competitive advantage.

This correction comes as the broader market sentiment turns bearish and cautious while Bitcoin (BTC) experiences persistent volatility and moves into bear market territory. Ethereum And Dogecoin Market Cap Takes A Hit Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has recorded a significant drop in its market cap in the last 24 hours. While the price of Ethereum has declined to $1,910, its market cap has also gone down approximately 7.8%. Related Reading: Here’s Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, And The Entire Crypto Market Is Crashing Today A combination of factors has contributed to this unfortunate drop in valuation, including investor caution ahead of key economic reports and ongoing bearish sentiments. While Ethereum’s trading volume seems to be the only metric in the green, jumping by 80%, liquidations persist as traders exit their positions ahead of further losses. On a similar note, Dogecoin, the number one meme coin, has experienced steep losses in both its value and market cap. Despite its 30.5% increase in trading volume, Dogecoin’s market cap has fallen by 6.6%. This decline follows a recent surge in meme-based cryptocurrencies earlier this year, which appears to be losing momentum. As of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at $0.16, reflecting a deep correction of 16.8% in the last seven days and a massive 37% crash over the past month. Notably, the decline in Dogecoin and Ethereum’s market cap is the highest in the last 24 hours, with coins in the top 10 experiencing a less than 2% drop. This massive drop in both cryptocurrencies comes as analysts confirm that Bitcoin has entered bear market territory. Bitcoin And Altcoins Enter Bear Market According to crypto analyst Tony Severino, Bitcoin may have entered bear market territory as the pioneer cryptocurrency faces decreasing momentum. Severino’s analysis applies the Elliott Wave Theory, which claims that the bear market for altcoins started in 2022, coinciding with Bitcoin’s Wave 5. Related Reading: Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Solana: Real Vision’s Raoul Pal Calls The Greatest Macro Trade Of All Time During this period, the market saw a rise in interest rates and Quantitative Tightening (QT), where central banks reduced liquidity in financial markets. Since altcoins thrive when there is excess liquidity, economic tightening has led to weak performance for these digital currencies. Severino argues that Bitcoin’s Wave 5 lacked the usual strength of a true bull market top. Based on the Elliott Wave Theory, the fifth wave has always been weaker than the third in terms of price speed, volume, and breadth. The analyst also referenced a textbook that explains that Wave 5 tends to be sideways and weak, often preceding the bear market as it indicates waning momentum. The overall conclusion of Severino’s analysis is that the altcoin bear market, which began more than three years ago, has never really ended since economic conditions haven’t returned to what they were before 2022.

Ian Balina, the CEO of Token Metrics and a YouTuber with more than 100,000 subscribers, said the US Securities and Exchange Commission will stop pursuing him in court over allegations he violated securities laws by promoting Sparkster (SPRK) tokens in 2018. Speaking to Cointelegraph on March 11, Balina said the SEC had informed him it planned to recommend the court dismiss a case filed in 2022 alleging “unregistered offering and promotion in 2018 of crypto asset securities called SPRK Tokens.” According to the crypto YouTuber, the SEC’s actions were based on the change in the administration’s priorities — referring to US President Donald Trump appointing acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda after the departure of Gary Gensler in January. “Obviously, the new administration is pro-crypto,” said Balina, claiming that the “time has ended” for crypto regulation through enforcement. Balina speaking about Sparkster on YouTube in 2018. Source: Ian Balina The SEC complaint against Balina, filed in September 2022, alleged the YouTuber agreed to receive a 30% bonus from Sparkster on the $5 million worth of tokens he purchased in the initial coin offering (ICO) — but did not disclose this information to his social media followers. In one of the last significant court rulings, a judge said in May 2024 that “SPRK tokens qualify as securities” under the SEC’s purview. At the time of the 2024 decision, Balina’s legal team said it planned to appeal. The judge initially set a January 2025 jury trial date but approved a July 2024 motion for a continuance and agreed to schedule the proceedings at a later date. At the time of publication, no filing appeared on the docket in the US District Court for the Western District of Texas requesting to dismiss the case. In response to an inquiry from Cointelegraph, the SEC declined to comment on the case. “It definitely was not cheap, cost a lot of money in terms of legal fees, which definitely sucks,” said Balina. “Makes me wish the SEC hadn’t put priority on all this.” About-face from SEC on crypto enforcement after Gensler’s departure If confirmed by the SEC, petitioning to drop Balina’s case would be the commission’s latest action favoring crypto companies facing similar lawsuits. Since Trump took office on Jan. 20, the regulator announced it would stop pursuing investigations into Robinhood Crypto, Gemini, Uniswap and OpenSea and dropped cases against Coinbase , Consensys, Kraken and others. The commission still has an open case against Ripple Labs, facing an appeal and cross-appeal following a $125 judgment in August 2024. Related: SEC looking to abandon effort requiring crypto firms to register as exchanges Many critics have suggested that the crypto industry purchased influence with the Trump administration by supporting the Republican candidate in the 2024 election or contributing to his inauguration fund after his November victory. The US president hosted a crypto summit at the White House on March 7, attended by many industry leaders who directly or indirectly supported “pro-crypto” candidates in the last election cycle, including representatives of Robinhood, Gemini, Coinbase and Kraken.

Only 5% of SWIFT’s volume will see token prices soaring to $100 with Bet-David highlighting potential stumbling blocks. XRP Price To Clinch $1,000 In The Near Future According to Bet-David, XRP has a chance to reach the $1,000 mark after a lengthy period in the doldrums. To achieve the milestone, the financial commentator disclosed that XRP will have to match SWIFT’s transaction volume but even a slice will send prices rallying. SWIFT, a global payments processing platform, processes $5 trillion daily or $1.24 quadrillion annually. Bet-David argues that the XRP price can reach $100 if the XRP Ledger can handle between 5%-10% of SWIFT’s daily volume. Per the analyst, the ledger will have to process $125 million annually to reach 10% of SWIFT’s transaction volume. In order to reach $1,000 per token, the XRP Ledger has to fully match the entirety of SWIFT’s transaction volume. At the moment, the XRP Ledger only handles a fraction of the volume but rising institutional adoption sees it inch forward. Stablecoins on the ledger like RLUSD are tipped to lead the charge to grab a portion of SWIFT’s daily transaction volumes. There is growing enthusiasm that XRP can be the cornerstone of US financial policy as it turns toward stablecoin adoption. For Bet-David, a jolt will come in the form of an SEC case dismissal, setting it up for borader institutional investment. “Analysts estimate that a $10 trillion market cap could push XRP’s price to $100 per token, with full replacement potentially driving it to $1,000,” said Bet-David. XRP Recovers After A Steep Price Crash XRP price is trading at $2.20 climbing by an impressive 6% over a 24-hour period. The recovery follows a week marred by declining values and rising whale activity in the ecosystem. Despiute the small rally over the day, XRP has lost over 10% in the last seven days, sparking fears that XRP has topped in this cycle. Despite the decline, the network has a streak of positives going on for it as a silver lining for investors. XRP active addresses surged to 1.15 million in the middle of a steep market correction, signaling a market frenzy. In upbeat XRP news, Franklin Templeton has filed for an XRP ETF, accentuating a wave of positivity for the beleagured network.

41502355,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=139246,1741729209,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary Bitcoin DeFi: Starknet & Xverse Join Forces to Transform BTC,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/revolutionary-bitcoin-defi-starknet-xverse/,"Get ready for a groundbreaking shift in the crypto landscape! Imagine the robust security of Bitcoin combined with the innovative world of Decentralized Finance (DeFi). Sounds like a dream? Well, dream no more! Starknet , the powerful Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solution, is teaming up with Xverse , the leading Bitcoin wallet, to make this dream a reality. Prepare for a revolutionary wave of Bitcoin DeFi as these two crypto giants join forces! Unveiling the Vision: What is Starknet Bitcoin DeFi? So, what exactly is this buzz about Starknet Bitcoin DeFi ? In simple terms, Starknet is aiming to extend its Ethereum Layer 2 prowess to the Bitcoin network. Think of it as building a super-fast highway next to a bustling city. Bitcoin, while secure and established, can be a bit slow in terms of transaction speed. Starknet acts as this high-speed highway, enabling faster and more scalable transactions for Bitcoin. The core idea is that Starknet will function as Bitcoin’s execution layer. This means that while Bitcoin remains the bedrock for security and asset storage, Starknet will handle the heavy lifting of transaction processing. This approach is projected to boost transaction speeds from Bitcoin’s current 13 transactions per second (TPS) to an impressive thousands of TPS. All this while maintaining the security and activity anchored to the Ethereum blockchain. It’s like getting the best of both worlds! Why Xverse? The Gateway to Bitcoin DeFi Why is Xverse , a Bitcoin wallet, the chosen partner for this ambitious endeavor? Xverse isn’t just any Bitcoin wallet; it’s a forward-thinking platform focused on expanding the utility of Bitcoin. By integrating with Starknet, Xverse is positioning itself as the gateway for users to access the burgeoning world of Xverse Bitcoin DeFi . Xverse’s role is crucial in bridging the gap between Bitcoin’s robust security and the dynamic possibilities of DeFi. They are committed to creating a user-friendly experience for Bitcoin holders to engage with DeFi applications built on Starknet. This partnership simplifies the complexities often associated with cross-chain interactions, making Bitcoin DeFi more accessible to the average user. The Q2 2025 Target: What to Expect? Mark your calendars! The integration is slated for Q2 2025. While that might seem like a while away, it’s important to remember that building secure and robust DeFi infrastructure takes time and meticulous planning. So, what can we realistically expect by Q2 2025? Early Stage DeFi Applications: Expect to see the initial wave of DeFi applications launching on Starknet for Bitcoin. These might include decentralized exchanges (DEXs), lending platforms, and yield farming opportunities, all tailored for Bitcoin assets. Seamless User Experience via Xverse: Xverse wallet is expected to provide a streamlined interface for users to interact with these new DeFi applications. This means easier navigation, clearer transaction processes, and simplified access to DeFi functionalities directly from your Bitcoin wallet. Foundation for Future Growth: Q2 2025 is just the beginning. This integration will lay the groundwork for a more expansive and mature Ethereum Layer 2 Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem in the years to come. Expect continuous development, more sophisticated DeFi products, and greater adoption over time. DeFi on Bitcoin Without OP_CAT: A Unique Approach One of the most intriguing aspects of this project is its approach to enabling DeFi on Bitcoin without relying on OP_CAT. OP_CAT is a proposed Bitcoin upgrade that could significantly enhance Bitcoin’s programmability, making it easier to build complex smart contracts and DeFi applications directly on Bitcoin. However, its implementation is still under debate and not guaranteed. Starknet and Xverse are taking a different route. By leveraging Starknet as Bitcoin’s execution layer, they can bring DeFi capabilities to Bitcoin without needing OP_CAT. This is a significant advantage as it allows for faster innovation and deployment of DeFi solutions on Bitcoin, regardless of the OP_CAT upgrade timeline. It demonstrates a clever workaround to deliver BTC DeFi Integration sooner rather than later. Trust-Based vs. Trustless: Navigating the DeFi Spectrum According to CoinDesk, Xverse is initially aiming for a “trust-based” Bitcoin DeFi solution. This is an important distinction in the DeFi world. Let’s break down what this means: Feature Trust-Based DeFi Trustless DeFi Reliance on Intermediaries May involve some level of reliance on trusted intermediaries or custodians. Aims to minimize or eliminate the need for intermediaries, relying on smart contracts and cryptographic security. Transparency Transparency can vary depending on the platform and intermediaries involved. High transparency, as all transactions and smart contract code are typically publicly auditable on the blockchain. Control of Assets Users might temporarily relinquish some control of their assets to intermediaries. Users retain full control of their assets at all times, typically through self-custodial wallets. Complexity Can be simpler to implement initially, potentially faster to market. Often more complex to build and requires robust smart contract security and audits. Xverse’s approach suggests a pragmatic starting point. Building fully trustless DeFi systems, especially across different blockchains, is a complex undertaking. A trust-based approach can allow for quicker iteration and user adoption while the technology and infrastructure for fully trustless solutions mature. The long-term vision, however, is likely to move towards greater trustlessness as the ecosystem evolves. Benefits of Starknet and Xverse Partnership for Bitcoin DeFi This collaboration is packed with potential benefits for the entire crypto ecosystem. Let’s explore some key advantages: Scalability for Bitcoin: Starknet’s Layer 2 solution directly addresses Bitcoin’s scalability limitations, paving the way for more complex and high-volume DeFi applications. Increased Utility for BTC: Unlocking DeFi on Bitcoin significantly expands the utility of BTC beyond just a store of value. It allows Bitcoin holders to actively participate in financial applications and earn yield on their holdings. Wider Adoption of DeFi: By bringing DeFi to the largest and most established cryptocurrency, this partnership has the potential to onboard a massive wave of new users into the world of decentralized finance. Innovation and Competition: This initiative fosters innovation in the DeFi space, driving competition and leading to the development of more diverse and sophisticated DeFi products and services. Cross-Chain Synergy: It showcases the power of cross-chain collaboration, demonstrating how different blockchains can work together to create a more interconnected and robust crypto ecosystem. Challenges and Considerations While the potential is immense, it’s important to acknowledge the challenges and considerations: Security Risks: Cross-chain DeFi solutions inherently introduce complexities and potential security risks. Robust security audits and rigorous testing are crucial to mitigate these risks. User Education: Educating Bitcoin users about DeFi concepts and how to safely interact with these new applications will be vital for successful adoption. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory landscape for DeFi is still evolving. Navigating these regulations and ensuring compliance will be an ongoing consideration. Complexity of Trust Models: Balancing the need for user-friendliness with the principles of trustlessness in DeFi requires careful design and implementation. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Bitcoin and DeFi The partnership between Starknet and Xverse marks a significant milestone in the evolution of both Bitcoin and DeFi. By bridging the gap between Bitcoin’s security and Ethereum’s DeFi innovation, they are poised to unlock a new era of Bitcoin DeFi . While challenges remain, the potential benefits – increased scalability, utility, and wider adoption – are undeniable. As we look forward to Q2 2025, the crypto community eagerly anticipates the dawn of Starknet Bitcoin DeFi , a development that could reshape the future of decentralized finance and the role of Bitcoin within it.

It seeks to integrate cryptocurrency into the core of the country’s economic strategy. The initiative mirrors the rising pro-crypto sentiment among influential lawmakers. It emphasizes long-term management of digital assets to address fiscal challenges and stimulate innovation. Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) reintroduced the BITCOIN Act on Tuesday , legislation designed to implement a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and authorize Bitcoin purchases to strengthen the U.S. financial position amid rising national debt. BITCOIN Act Gains Republican Support Lummis is bringing back the “Boosting Innovation, Technology, and Competitiveness through Optimized Investment Nationwide Act” (BITCOIN Act) alongside Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Bernie Moreno (R-OH), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Jim Justice (R-WV), and Tommy Tuberville (R-AL). The BITCOIN Act is back. pic.twitter.com/WNeU6SWPj3 — Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) March 11, 2025 The proposed law intends to officially establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, a 1-million-unit Bitcoin purchase initiative representing roughly 5% of the cryptocurrency’s total supply. The reserve would be financed by funds allocated from federal spending. Additionally, the bill emphasizes self-custody rights for private Bitcoin holders. The legislation aligns with President Donald Trump’s proposal of establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve as part of his financial policy. Rep. Nick Begich (R-AK) has introduced complementary legislation in the U.S. House. “Decades of out-of-control spending has led to a $36 trillion national debt, and developing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is a critical step to improving our nation’s balance sheet,” said Moreno. Lummis, who has long championed the concept of a Bitcoin reserve, may finally see it come true after Trump instructed his administration to form one just last week. “Together, we are not just adapting to the future – we are actively shaping it, writing the next chapter in America’s proud history of financial innovation and securing lasting prosperity for all our,” she added. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and National Debt The proposed reserve involves purchasing up to 1 million Bitcoins, equivalent to around 5% of Bitcoin’s total supply . Supporters argue this could help stabilize the national balance sheet, currently burdened by approximately $36 trillion in debt. Under the BITCOIN Act, acquired Bitcoins would be managed as a strategic asset, safeguarded via self-custody protocols. The plan intends to enhance financial security and leverage the economic benefits of cryptocurrency . The legislation awaits further review and potential votes in Congress, where its feasibility and impact will be examined. If approved, the BITCOIN Act would represent a major federal endorsement of cryptocurrency. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What broader effects could a national Bitcoin reserve have? By integrating Bitcoin into national reserves, the government may reduce fiscal risks and foster innovation. This strategy could reshape economic policy and strengthen America’s global financial leadership. How might this legislation influence global cryptocurrency markets? If passed, the bill may encourage international peers to adopt similar measures, boosting investor confidence and market legitimacy while setting a precedent for integrating digital assets into national strategies.

Meanwhile, analysts warn that Ether’s price could face further declines as ETF outflows and mounting macroeconomic concerns put pressure on the market. Additionally, Mt. Gox has made its second Bitcoin transfer in a week EU watchdogs scrutinizing OKX over $100M in Bybit laundered funds: Report European Union regulators are reportedly looking into a service offered by crypto exchange OKX that may have played a role in the laundering of $100 million in funds from the Bybit hack, according to Bloomberg. A March 11 Bloomberg report citing people familiar with the matter claims that national watchdogs from the EU’s member states discussed the issue during a March 6 meeting hosted by the European Securities and Markets Authority’s Digital Finance Standing Committee. The issue appears to be OKX’s decentralized finance platform and wallet service. On Jan. 27, OKX announced that it had secured a full Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) license to operate across all EU member states under a unified regulatory framework. The question for EU regulators is whether two OKX services fall under the MiCA framework and, if so, whether the exchange could be penalized. According to Bybit CEO Ben Zhou, nearly $100 million, or 40,233 Ether (ETH), from the $1.5 billion hack had been laundered through OKX’s Web3 proxy, with a portion of the funds now untraceable. In a statement posted to X, OKX refuted the claim there were any ongoing investigations by the EU, adding that “Bybit’s statements are spreading misinformation” and defending its Web3 wallet services. Source: OKX Ether risks correction to $1,800 as ETF outflows, tariff fears continue Ether is struggling to reverse a near three-month downtrend as macroeconomic concerns and continued selling pressure from US Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) weigh on investor sentiment. Ether ( ETH ) has fallen by more than 53% since it began its downtrend on Dec. 16, 2024, after it had peaked above $4,100, TradingView data shows. The downtrend has been fueled by global uncertainty around US import tariffs triggering trade war concerns and a lack of builder activity on the Ethereum network, according to Bitfinex analysts. ETH/USD, 1-day chart, downtrend. Source: Cointelegraph/ TradingView “A lack of new projects or builders moving to ETH, primarily due to high operating fees, is likely the principal reason behind the lackluster performance of ETH. [...] We believe that for ETH, $1,800 will be a strong level to watch,” the analysts told Cointelegraph. “However, the current sell-off is not being seen solely in ETH, we have seen a marketwide correction as fears over the impact of tariffs hit all risk assets,” they added. Crypto investors are also wary of an early bear market cycle that could break from the traditional four-year crypto market pattern. Bitcoin ( BTC ) is at risk of falling to $70,000 as cryptocurrencies and global financial markets undergo a “macro correction” while remaining in a bull market cycle, said Aurelie Barthere, principal research analyst at blockchain analytics firm Nansen. Mt. Gox makes second Bitcoin move in a week as it taps $76,000 Defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox moved 11,833 Bitcoin ( BTC ), worth $926.2 million, on March 11 — its second big BTC transfer in a week amid the cryptocurrency’s price falling to a four-month low of around $76,700. Arkham Intelligence data analyzed by Lookonchain found that 11,501 BTC was sent to a new wallet. The remaining 332 BTC were transferred to a warm wallet, which analytics firm Spot On Chain said could be moved to assist with the repayments. Mt. Gox moved 12,000 Bitcoin worth a little over $1 billion on March 6. The exchange fell into bankruptcy in early 2014 and similar moves it has made in the past have been a precursor to it paying out its creditors. Transaction details of Mt. Gox’s $931 million transfer.

The founder is back in the news after he went viral for purchasing and consuming a $6 million banana taped to a wall not too long ago. Sun quote tweeted a post from CryptoDiffer on Tuesday that revealed Tron’s great performance compared to other top cryptos including BTC, ETH, and SOL. The founder also tagged Trump, whose attention he has seriously courted since the United States president became interested in crypto. A comparison of the top 10 cryptocurrencies since Trump took office on January 20. Source: Crypto Differ How the top ten tokens have fared so far The chart released compared the fair value of the top ten cryptocurrencies from January 20, 2025, when Trump was inaugurated, with their current prices as of March 10, 2025, and calculated the percentage change in price since the inauguration. According to the data, most of the top 10 tokens have taken a significant beating since Trump’s inauguration with only TRON showing a significant positive gain. Dogecoin is arguably the biggest loser, down 30.4% from its peak; most likely a side effect of investors de-risking after realizing that the existence of Elon Musk’s DOGE barely affects the price of the DOGE meme. Another big loser was Solana which has seen a price decline of up to 27%. The latest dip has shaken investor confidence, but the cult community around the token persists, making all this seem like a phase it will leave behind soon. Among the top ten tokens, Solana is one of those that Trump selected to be added to the strategic crypto stockpile the US plans to create, which should also be a silver lining. Bitcoin, which surged to a record high of $109,071 shortly after Trump’s inauguration, has since fallen under $100,000 thanks to investors taking profit, the failures of American crypto executive orders to stir markets, and the uncertainty from Trump’s tariff wars. Tron is undoubtedly the stand-out from the list, with its massive +92.6% increase, which makes it the only cryptocurrency in the top 10 to perform positively despite the TRX not making the list of tokens Trump earmarked for America’s crypto reserve. XRP made that list, and it showed more stability relative to other tokens on the list, with only a small decline of 0.4%. The behavior of the top ten tokens in response to all the political meddling that is happening is not unexpected. Historically, the crypto market has been known to experience a cool-down period following a presidential inauguration in the US. In President Trump’s case, the market is in serious correction mode after the election euphoria died off. There was a lot of euphoria following Trump’s election victory. In fact, on the day he was sworn in, the Republican stalwart was flanked by some of the wealthiest Americans, including Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Mark Zuckerberg, all of whom had seen huge gains thanks to the stock markets. Unfortunately, like the top ten cryptocurrencies, the president’s caucus of wealthy friends and supporters has also suffered substantial losses that have shaved billions off their net worth. It has been weeks since Trump was sworn in, but in that time, five of the billionaires who sat behind him in the Capitol Rotunda have lost a combined $209 billion in wealth. Photo from the Trump Inauguration Day on January 20. Source: Trump Inauguration (X/Twitter) So far, the S&P 500 has lost 6.4%, Elon Musk is down $148 billion, Sergey Brin has lost $22 billion, and Bernard Arnault has recorded $5 billion in losses. Any expectations that the market returns they enjoyed on Inauguration Day will continue have been ruined, and it is mostly thanks to some of Trump and Musk’s confrontations with long-time allies, mass layoffs of government employees, and a back-and-forth on tariffs. Why is Tron defying gravity? Tron has seen a huge surge in value in the weeks since Trump became president and it does not look like the growth will stop anytime soon. Tron’s value is currently at $0.22 USD per token down 47.6% from its all-time high. There are various reasons why Tron is doing so well, even though many other top tokens are floundering in the volatile market. A key driver of the positive momentum is its founder, Justin Sun, who has been in the spotlight for his bold investment in Donald Trump’s crypto project, World Liberty Financial (WLF). Tron founder Justin Sun’s officially designated photo for Consensus 2025, Hong Kong. Source: Justin Sun (X/Twitter) Sun, who has also been appointed as an advisor to the World Liberty Financial project, invested $30 million in WLF shortly after Trump’s re-election, and the decision seemingly catalyzed investor confidence in the TRX token. The confidence appears to have persisted even though it was left out of the list of tokens to be added to the reserve and in the face of market volatility. Sun’s involvement initially raised eyebrows due to his ongoing legal troubles with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which saw him accused of fraud, market manipulation, and unregistered offerings in March 2023. Fortunately, the new SEC administration is less combative towards crypto players and has put the case on hold while they explore a potential resolution with a status update expected by April.

The exchange has secured registration with the country’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). Regulatory Compliance Unlocks Market Potential In an update on X, Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, confirmed the development to members of the broader crypto community. According to Grewal, the company’s FIU registration in India is critical to supporting the country’s local entrepreneurs. Notably, local businesses can leverage the Coinbase platform to build global on-chain businesses and grow faster. This would also benefit Coinbase, given the large market in India where on-chain innovation can thrive. John O’Loghlen, Regional Managing Director for APAC at Coinbase, believes crypto can positively change many things in India. For instance, the current scenario is that young entrepreneurs and developers look abroad to build global companies. “India represents one of the most exciting market opportunities in the world today, and we’re proud to deepen our investment here in full compliance with local regulations,” O’Loghlen stated. Coinbase Journey in India’s Strict Crypto Regulatory Space Grewal emphasized that securing the FIU approval is a “major step towards empowering Indian entrepreneurs to build, innovate, and scale global on-chain businesses— all from home.” This highlights that Coinbase can now serve Indian users by supporting the broader Web3 and blockchain ecosystem. Interestingly, Coinbase exited India in 2022 due to regulatory pressure. The Indian crypto space became more difficult to operate in 2023 when the regulatory authority tightened rules on digital assets. This included adding virtual assets under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. The move required crypto platforms, including exchanges, to register with the FIU. Hence, Coinbase’s re-entry into the Indian crypto space signals a willingness to comply with the country’s rules. Coinbase’s Broader Expansion Strategy The development aligns with the broader trend among crypto exchanges like Binance, which has resumed operations in India . Their resumption also came after meeting new compliance requirements spelled out by the regulatory body. Beyond re-entry into the Indian market, Coinbase recently revealed plans to commence 24/7 futures trading . The Coinbase derivatives offering will allow U.S. users to trade anytime and control their investments around the clock.

With a 292-132 vote, a bipartisan majority in the House joined the U.S. Senate in advancing the Congressional Review Act resolution overturning the rule finalized in the closing days of former President Joe Biden's administration. Missouri Republican Jason Smith, urging his fellow lawmakers to vote for the resolution earlier in the day, said the IRS rule risked harming U.S. businesses and disincentivized innovation. ""There are real questions that the rule can ever even be administered,"" he said. ""DeFi exchanges are not the same as centralized crypto exchanges or traditional banks or brokers. DeFi platforms do not and cannot even collect the information from users needed to implement this rule."" Last week, 70 Senators voted to overturn the rule , and President Donald Trump's senior advisers have already recommended he sign the provision. However, the Senate will need to approve the resolution again due to budget rules, Rep. Jason Smith (R-Mo.) noted. If it approves the resolution and Trump signs it, the IRS will be barred from ever bringing a similar rule again. Illinois Democrat Danny Davis pushed back against the resolution, noting that it stemmed from the 2021 bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and comparing crypto to stocks. ""When you sell stock with a stock broker, the broker reports the proceeds of the sale to both you and the Internal Revenue Service,"" he said. ""Probably to no one's surprise, when there is independent reporting on these sales, taxpayers are more likely to report their income to the Internal Revenue Service."" North Carolina Republican Tim Moore said the rule ""goes far beyond"" Congress's intention with the 2021 law. ""This rule has placed impossible burdens on software developers threatening American leadership in digital asset innovation,"" he said. Texas Democrat Lloyd Doggett called the resolution ""special interest legislation,"" adding that it could be ""exploited by wealthy tax cheats, drug traffickers and terrorist financiers,"" and add $4 billion to the national debt, conflicting with U.S. President Donald Trump's stated goal of cutting the debt. Tuesday's vote was preceded by the House vote on a continuing resolution to fund the U.S. government through Sept. 30, 2025, which passed with 217 votes in favor to 213 votes against. That funding resolution now heads to the Senate.",Policy|IRS|DeFi,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-11 21:56:42

The analysts predict that ADA could decrease by 33% to $0.68 if the current support level breaks apart although ADA is listed in the U.S. Crypto Reserve. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) attracts investors who abandoned risky assets during the current bear market while Phase 3 of its presale crosses the $3 million mark. One can acquire MUTM tokens during phase 3 of the presale at $0.02 for a 200% profit opportunity because the platform plans to list the tokens on exchanges at $0.06 before potentially reaching a maximum price point of $3.50. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) draws more than 5,000 investors with its lending utilities and tokenomics design which makes it a shelter during Cardano’s market instability. Cardano’s Bearish Signals Contrast Mutuum Finance’s Presale Momentum Price movements for Cardano create an unusual opposite trend compared to other rising cryptocurrencies. The 4-hour price structure of ADA shows lower levels nearing a symmetrical triangle pattern because it lacks sufficient buying pressure to exceed $0.85 resistance. The political endorsement events have led whales to accumulate 420 million ADA yet retail traders show reluctance due to concerns about ADA sinking to $0.68. Uncertainty has driven investors toward projects such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) because they let users secure early profits through presale mechanisms. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) counters speculative volatility with tangible DeFi applications. Phase 3 of the presale offers MUTM tokens at $0.02 while its next phase price will be $0.025. The presale participants currently expect their token value to grow up to 200% when MUTM starts trading at $0.06 based on clear tokenomics calculations instead of marketing hype. The growth model for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) functions differently than ADA since it bases its expansion on user activity involving lending pools and collateralized loans and interest-bearing mtTokens. Mutuum Finance’s Buy Pressure Model Outshines ADA’s Speculative Swings Mutuum Finance (MUTM) uses its buy-and-distribute system to create natural market demand. Cardano’s price needs to surpass $0.90 resistance level before advancing. The system automatically buys MUTM tokens using sectioned platform fees before distributing the tokens to users who stake mtTokens. The automated purchase program generates regular token demand which protects MUTM from deteriorating prices that affect ADA. Mutuum Finance motivates users through a $100,000 giveaway that grants $10,000 prizes to first supporters while enhancing the project’s credibility. The numbers resonate. By investing $2,500 at present the investor obtains 166,666 MUTM tokens. At launch, this stake balloons to $10,000 (200% ROI). The same initial investment of $100,000 has the potential to grow into $583,331 should the expected adoption rate of $3.50 materialize after launch. This prediction sits between the projected $1-$10 range. The calculation system avoids considering both the potential returns from staking and the price appreciation of mtToken although ADA lacks these profit-enhancing mechanisms. The available opportunities to purchase MUTM tokens for $0.02 will become rarer since phase 3 presale slots are running out. Each successive phase extends the level of difficulty for joining as a deliberate initiative that benefits initial subscribers. The complex processes of stop-loss triggers and liquidation risks affecting ADA traders are converted into structured growth by Mutuum Finance (MUTM) which unites innovative DeFi solutions with profit protections that volatile markets typically do not provide. Customers who want to purchase MUTM at $0.02 must act now because phase 3 of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is about to end. Users must access the official website to enroll in the $100.000 prize competition. Waiting beyond this point runs the dangers of missing enhanced launch value as well as access to a platform that transforms DeFi evolution. Secure your MUTM tokens today.

Anchorage Digital Bank is a New York Department of Financial Services BitLicense holder and the only federally chartered digital asset bank in the United States, having received a charter from the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in 2021. It is the custodian of the crypto seized by the Justice Department. Copper operates a lending and collateral management platform. It will provide digital asset custody, prime services, and collateral management. It introduced an agency lending platform in February. Cantor Fitzgerald announced the addition of Bitcoin financing to its offerings in July. It said at that time that it was selecting custodians. “Cantor Fitzgerald arranges and finances vast amounts of securities and commodities and, as strong supporters of Bitcoin, will now build an incredible platform to support Bitcoin investors’ financing needs,” then-chair Howard Lutnick said at the time. Cantor provides custody for Tether backing, gets its support now Cantor Fitzgerald may have received partial support from Tether Holdings for the new Bitcoin financing business. Bloomberg reported in November that the sides were negotiating Tether’s participation in the project. Cantor Fitzgerald manages Tether’s U.S. Treasurys, which back the $142 billion USDT stablecoin. Bloomberg cited data provided by The Wall Street Journal that indicates that Cantor Fitzgerald owns about 5% of Tether, valued at $600 million. Lutnick was the chairman of Cantor Fitzgerald until his appointment as U.S. secretary of commerce in February. Lutnick was a donor to U.S. President Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and was co-chair of his transition team. Lutnick’s son Brandon took over the chairmanship at Cantor Fitzgerald, and Lutnick’s son Kyle became vice chair. The Deutsche Boerse stock exchange is also reportedly preparing to offer institutional settlement and custody services for Bitcoin and Ether after about a year of planning. Bloomberg reported on March 11 that the exchange’s Clearstream unit will begin the service in April and eventually branch out into staking, lending, and brokerage, as well as providing custody for other coins. Clearstream head of issuer services and new digital markets Jens Hachmeister said, “With this offering, we are creating a one-stop shop around custody, brokerage and settlement.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

This news, initially reported by Walter Bloomberg on X, has the potential to send ripples across global markets, including the ever-volatile cryptocurrency sector. For crypto enthusiasts and investors, understanding the nuances of this US proposal and its possible ramifications is now more critical than ever. Let’s dive into what this could mean. Why a Ukraine Truce Could Shake Up the Crypto Market The crypto market, known for its sensitivity to global events, often reacts swiftly to geopolitical developments. A potential Ukraine truce , even a temporary one, could inject a dose of unexpected stability into a world grappling with uncertainty. But how exactly could this impact the digital asset space? Reduced Risk Aversion: Geopolitical tensions often fuel risk aversion. A truce could ease these fears, potentially leading investors to move away from safe-haven assets and explore riskier but higher-growth options like cryptocurrencies. Improved Market Sentiment: Positive news, like a potential step towards de-escalation, can boost overall market sentiment. This positive sentiment could spill over into the crypto market, driving up prices and increasing trading activity. Impact on Global Economies: The conflict in Ukraine has had significant global economic repercussions, including inflation and supply chain disruptions. A truce could be seen as a step towards easing these pressures, which could indirectly benefit the crypto market as part of the broader financial ecosystem. Think of it this way: when the world feels less chaotic, investors are generally more inclined to take calculated risks. Cryptocurrencies, with their inherent volatility and potential for high returns, could become more attractive in a less turbulent global environment. However, it’s crucial to remember that the crypto market is influenced by a multitude of factors, and geopolitical events are just one piece of the puzzle. Decoding the US Proposal: What We Know So Far While details are still emerging, the core of the news revolves around a US proposal for a 30-day truce. According to the X post by Walter Bloomberg, Ukraine is signaling a willingness to consider this proposition. But what might be the driving forces behind this proposal, and what could it entail? Aspect Potential Implications US Initiative The US, a key ally of Ukraine, is likely playing a crucial role in mediating and seeking diplomatic solutions. This proposal could be a part of broader efforts to de-escalate the conflict. 30-Day Duration A 30-day truce suggests a limited timeframe, potentially aimed at creating a window for dialogue and negotiations, rather than a permanent ceasefire. Ukraine’s Readiness Ukraine’s reported willingness to consider the proposal is a significant development. It could indicate a shift in strategy or a response to evolving geopolitical realities. Information Source (Walter Bloomberg on X) It’s important to note the source. While Walter Bloomberg is a known financial news source on X (formerly Twitter), official confirmations from government sources are still awaited to solidify the veracity and details of the agreement. It’s essential to approach this news with cautious optimism. While the signal of readiness is encouraging, the specifics of the peace talks , the conditions, and the likelihood of success remain uncertain. The geopolitical chessboard is complex, and many factors can influence the outcome. The Potential Benefits of a 30-Day Truce: A Glimmer of Hope? Even a temporary Ukraine truce could unlock a range of benefits, both on a humanitarian level and for global markets. Let’s explore some potential positive outcomes: Humanitarian Relief: The most immediate and profound benefit would be a pause in hostilities, offering respite to civilians and allowing for the potential delivery of aid and evacuation efforts. Diplomatic Opportunity: A truce could create a crucial window for diplomatic negotiations. It could provide a platform for dialogue and potentially pave the way for longer-term de-escalation strategies. Market Stabilization: As mentioned earlier, a truce could contribute to market stabilization. Reduced uncertainty can lead to more predictable trading environments, which can be beneficial for all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Economic Recovery Signals: A move towards peace, however tentative, could be interpreted as a signal of potential future economic recovery in the affected regions and globally. This optimism could stimulate investment and economic activity. Imagine a scenario where the guns fall silent, even for just 30 days. The psychological impact alone could be significant, fostering a sense of hope and possibility. For the crypto market, this could translate into a renewed appetite for investment and innovation. Navigating the Challenges and Uncertainties Ahead While the prospect of a geopolitical stability via a truce is enticing, it’s vital to acknowledge the inherent challenges and uncertainties. The path to peace is rarely smooth, and several hurdles could lie ahead: Fragility of Truce: A 30-day truce is inherently temporary. There’s no guarantee it will hold or lead to a more lasting resolution. Market reactions could be volatile, influenced by news flow and the perceived stability of the agreement. Complexity of Negotiations: Even with a truce, negotiations could be protracted and complex. Disagreements and setbacks are possible, which could dampen initial market optimism. Geopolitical Factors Beyond Ukraine: The global landscape is influenced by numerous factors beyond the Ukraine conflict. Other geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainties could still impact the crypto market, regardless of developments in Eastern Europe. Market Overreaction: Markets can sometimes overreact to news, both positively and negatively. It’s crucial for investors to maintain a balanced perspective and avoid making impulsive decisions based solely on initial headlines. The key takeaway here is to remain informed and adaptable. The situation is fluid, and the crypto market impact will likely be shaped by ongoing developments. Prudent investors should conduct thorough research, diversify their portfolios, and avoid making emotionally driven choices. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors: Staying Ahead of the Curve So, what should crypto investors do in light of this potentially game-changing news? Here are some actionable insights: Monitor News Closely: Stay updated on developments related to the Ukraine truce and the US proposal . Follow reputable news sources and be wary of misinformation. Analyze Market Reactions: Observe how the crypto market reacts to news updates. Look for trends and patterns in price movements and trading volumes. Assess Risk Tolerance: Understand your own risk tolerance. Geopolitical events can introduce volatility. Ensure your portfolio aligns with your comfort level. Diversify Your Portfolio: Diversification remains a cornerstone of risk management. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, especially in times of uncertainty. Consider Long-Term Strategy: Avoid knee-jerk reactions. Focus on your long-term investment strategy and consider how geopolitical events might influence your overall outlook. This is a moment that demands both vigilance and a balanced perspective. The potential for a peace talks and de-escalation is undoubtedly positive, but the journey ahead may still be filled with twists and turns. Staying informed, adaptable, and grounded in sound investment principles is your best approach. Conclusion: A Fragile Hope and the Crypto Market’s Response The news of Ukraine considering a 30-day truce, spurred by a US proposal , injects a powerful dose of hope into a world weary of conflict. While the path forward remains uncertain, the mere possibility of de-escalation is a significant development with the potential to influence global markets, including the dynamic realm of cryptocurrencies. For crypto investors, this news warrants careful attention and a measured response. By staying informed, understanding the nuances of the situation, and adhering to sound investment principles, you can navigate the potential opportunities and challenges that lie ahead.

In a new announcement, the DFPI says the crackdown is part of a broader initiative to combat increasing crypto-related fraud in the state, utilizing the department’s “Crypto Scam Tracker” to identify fraudulent schemes based on consumer complaints. Says DFPI Commissioner KC Mohseni, “As crypto scams evolve, DFPI’s Crypto Scam Tracker helps empower consumers to stay vigilant. It is a vital part of our enforcement strategy and role as a financial regulator, educator and enforcement agency. We urge all Californians to exercise caution with unknown platforms, verify website domains to avoid fraudulent imitations, and stay wary of crypto recovery scam sites. Staying informed and reporting scams to the DFPI strengthens the Crypto Scam Tracker, making it an even more effective tool in protecting consumers.” Officials reportedly processed over 2,600 complaints, uncovering scams ranging from fake Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining operations to deceptive crypto gaming platforms and fraudulent job offers. The investigation also identified seven new scam types, highlighting hackers’ evolving tactics. Says Attorney General Rob Bonta, “As scammers grow increasingly sophisticated and calculated, so must our enforcement. Scammers can use deception and emotional manipulation to take advantage of people looking for connections. While there is much work to be done, I want to take a moment to celebrate the hard work of my team, who took action to protect consumers by shutting down these fake cryptocurrency websites last year. I would also like to thank our state partners at the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation for their collaboration. I urge Californians to be vigilant and protect their finances: Do not send money to anyone you have never met in person.” Investigators also noted the prevalence of “pig-butchering” scams, where fraudsters manipulate victims into investing in non-existent cryptocurrency projects. Such schemes have contributed significantly to the $9.9 billion in global crypto scam losses reported in 2024.

The move comes just days after President Trump issued an executive order to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve and digital asset stockpile, which will include various other crypto assets confiscated by the U.S. government “in connection with criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings.” Lummis Reintroduces Landmark Bitcoin Act On Tuesday, Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis, known as the “Bitcoin senator”, resubmitted a bill that would create a strategic Bitcoin reserve to help “bolster America’s balance sheet.” The bill, dubbed the “Boosting Innovation, Technology, and Competitiveness through Optimized Investment Nationwide Act,” or BITCOIN ACT, would direct the U.S. government to purchase one million BTC (roughly 5% of the total Bitcoin supply) — a sum valued at around $82 billion at press time — over the course of five years. That huge purchase would be partly financed by the net earnings of the Federal Reserve. “By transforming the president’s visionary executive action into enduring law, we can ensure that our nation will harness the full potential of digital innovation to address our national debt while maintaining our competitive edge in the global economy,” Lummis said in a Tuesday statement posted on X. Lummis’ proposed legislation would create a “decentralized network of secure Bitcoin vaults” overseen by the Treasury, where huge quantities of the asset would be held in cold wallets. The Treasury Secretary would be responsible for organizing the purchase of new Bitcoin and maintaining the reserve. All new BTC added to the reserve would have to be held for at least 20 years before it could be liquidated. Moreover, any sitting or future Treasury secretary would be barred from selling over 10% of the reserve within two years. Notably, fellow Republican senators Jim Justice (R-WV), Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), and Bernie Moreno (R-OH) are cosponsors of the Bitcoin Act. Republican Nick Begich intends to introduce a companion bill in the U.S. House of Representatives. Progress Toward A U.S. Bitcoin Reserve In January, President Trump signed an executive order directing federal officials to study the feasibility of a national Bitcoin stockpile. It was one of the first major crypto-related actions of Trump after retaking the White House. Currently, at least 19 states in the U.S. are exploring the possibility of deploying the world’s first cryptocurrency as part of their financial strategy. Some states like Texas and Arizona are currently in the final stages of the approval process. In November, prominent cryptographer and Blockstream CEO Adam Back speculated that the nationwide approval of a US Bitcoin reserve could propel Bitcoin above the seven-figure mark in this cycle.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|USA,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-11 22:01:27

Authorities are assessing whether the platform falls under the EU's new Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulations and discussing possible penalties. The investigation follows the massive $1.5 billion hack of Bybit, one of the largest crypto thefts to date. National regulators from the EU’s 27 member states discussed the matter during a meeting of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) on March 6, according to sources familiar with the matter. Regulators are focusing on OKX’s Web3 service, which it promotes as a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform and self-custodial wallet, Bloomberg reported, which hackers with alleged ties to North Korea reportedly used to move stolen funds across various exchanges and blockchains. Related News: Coinbase Announces Support After Backlash For Token It Previously Announced It Would Delist The key question for regulators is whether OKX’s Web3 platform falls under MiCA, and if so, what penalties could be imposed. The EU’s new framework aims to regulate crypto service providers and improve consumer protection. OKX has disputed the claims, saying Bloomberg’s report was misleading. The company responded by saying that its Web3 service operates like other self-custody wallets and exchange aggregators in the industry. OKX also said it was not under investigation and had implemented new measures to block hacker addresses from using its decentralized exchange (DEX) or wallet services. *This is not investment advice.

The first, signed on January 23, created a Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets. The second, signed last week, ordered the establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a digital asset stockpile. The president may be preparing to sign a third order expected to roll back anti-crypto banking rules of the Harris-Biden administration. Pushing Fed To Open Its Doors To Crypto Companies According to sources familiar with the matter, the expected executive order will explicitly abolish the rules and regulatory initiatives linked to the “Operation Chokepoint 2.0,” an orchestrated effort by the Biden administration to allegedly deny crypto and tech founders banking services. The implosion of crypto-friendly banks in early 2023 triggered first allegations of Operation Chokepoint 2.0. Pundits, including venture capitalist Nic Carter, described it as a government initiative to pressure banks into severing ties with crypto-related firms secretly. Notably, President Trump recently told a room full of crypto industry leaders and government officials at the White House Crypto Summit that he is “ending Operation Chokepoint 2.0.” According to the latest reports, the executive order would mandate crypto-friendly banks to be granted Federal Reserve master accounts. These accounts are key to banks’ ability to efficiently serve clients nationwide as they provide access to Fed services such as settlement and electronic transfers. During the Biden regime, the Fed relentlessly declined to grant master accounts to crypto-focused banks like Custodia, hindering their expansion. Reversing Operation Chokepoint 2.0 and allowing crypto banks to access the Fed’s services would mark a huge development for the crypto industry. Meanwhile, the anticipated crypto executive order could extend beyond debanking to include directives stating that stablecoins should not be classed as securities. Both provisions could greatly boost crypto mass adoption by making it not burdensome for digital asset exchanges to offer users familiar on-ramp and off-ramp services.",Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News|trump,EN,0,0,REGULATION|FIAT|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-11 22:04:32
