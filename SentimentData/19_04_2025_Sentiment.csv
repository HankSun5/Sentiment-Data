However, analyst Dr. Cat has warned that, contrary to public opinion, this development is bearish, not bullish, for the flagship crypto. In an X post, Dr. Cat stated that Bitcoin entering oversold levels is “super-bearish” and overbought levels are “super-bullish.” He explained that for the oscillator to reach oversold values, it means that the price action has been extremely bearish, indicating why investors are selling their holdings. Why Bitcoin Entering Oversold Levels Is Bearish The crypto analyst further remarked that Oscillators are range-bound indicators, so they can’t go beyond 0 and 100, as they are limited by their mathematical formulas. However, he added that the Bitcoin price can go lower or higher. Dr. Cat then alluded to Bitcoin’s bull markets, noting that all of them are in overbought territory on the weekly chart.

However, he remarked that whoever advises buying a weekly oversold chart based on the claim that it is bullish because it is oversold has no idea what they are talking about. He remarked that many altcoins are oversold on the higher timeframe and can remain oversold as they approach zero, where the analyst claims they are eventually headed. Dr. Cat also explained that in a bull market, oversold conditions on the daily chart may mark higher lows on the weekly or monthly chart. However, in a bear market, oversold conditions may persist or just lead to some consolidation before more downside. Dr. Cat then alluded to Quinten’s chart, which he said showed what daily oversold conditions led to one year earlier in different broader market conditions. The analyst cautioned that he wasn’t discussing whether Bitcoin is in a bull or bear market or where it is headed, but simply clarifying the misconception about oversold and overbought RSI. BTC’s Supply Overwhelming Demand At The Moment In an X post, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju revealed that Bitcoin’s supply is currently greater than its demand at the moment, providing a bearish outlook for the flagship crypto. This supports the idea of BTC being in oversold conditions right now, with holders selling their coins rather than buying.

At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $84,600, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

43503505,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=712233,1745013621,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/43503505.jpeg,Retail investors keep buying the dip but what happens when the market doesn’t bounce back?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/retail-investors-keep-buying-the-dip/,"Retail investors are still rushing to “buy the dip,” but market veterans warn the strategy could fail if share prices keep falling instead of bouncing back. For most of the past 15 years, buying every dip has worked. Brief recessions, including the 2020 downturn and the 2022 bear market, were followed by quick, strong rebounds. Anyone who started investing during that era might think that sell-offs are only temporary. “If, anytime, there’s a sell‑off, it’s just a buying opportunity, why would you ever stop that?” Scott Sheridan said to MarketWatch . He added, “These people have never seen a down move up until the last couple of weeks.” The latest shock came after the White House announced sweeping tariffs on April 2. From April 2 to April 7, the S&P 500 dropped 11 %, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid more than 10 %, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 12 %. On the other hand, the Cboe Volatility Index peaked near 52 on April 8, and on April 9, the S&P 500 logged its best single‑day gain since 2008, jumping 9.5%, before slipping again in the following sessions. Small traders were on a buying spree despite Wall Street’s concerns over the economic impact of tariffs JPMorgan data shows $21 billion in equities inflows between April 3 and April 16, far above normal levels. April 3 alone drew $4.7 billion, the largest single‑day haul the bank has recorded. JPMorgan says the urge to buy the dip has grown stronger since 2022. Retail flows increased after Trump’s April 2 tariff announcement. Source: BNY “Retail has been continuously buying dips since the pandemic,” said Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial. “But that trade worked out great. It has not broken until now, where maybe they bought the first 3% to 5% down, and now they’re underwater.” Bob Savage, head of markets macro strategy at BNY, warned that the strategy can fail. “Outsized moves down have a tipping point linked to volatility and the state of the economy,” he wrote, adding that the rest of April depends on how the Federal Open Market Committee responds. “The history of 2008 trading suggests you need a bigger policy to turn the dip to work.” Turnquist noted that if investors buy the first dip and the market keeps sliding or recovers slowly, they sit on losses for an unknown period. No one can forecast when the next rebound will arrive. Sheridan used a rubber band example. Stretch it and it snaps back, stretch it again and it snaps back again. That has been the pattern for years. In 2024 alone, the S&P 500 set 57 record closes, about one every 4.4 trading days. Yet rubber bands can break. Sheridan, who traded through the crashes of 1987, 2000, and 2008, worries the next prolonged slump will shock newcomers. “People who only began investing during the past 15 years have yet to experience something like that,” he said. Heavy dip buyers are at risk of steeper losses Trading platform Public reported a jump in customers moving money out of high‑yield cash accounts to buy stocks. Sam Nofzinger, Public’s general manager of crypto and brokerage, said, “People have been sitting on mountains of cash for the past year and finally see [an opportunity to invest],”. A deeper recession would not only drive prices lower; it could threaten jobs and incomes, slicing the money that fuels dip buying. “You really need a dot‑com or global financial crisis kind of situation for that to unfold,” Turnquist said. “And who knows. That’s not in our playbook for this year or next year.” Whenever the next severe downturn arrives, heavy dip‑buyers risk steeper losses and, Sheridan fears, may quit the market altogether. Still, he remains optimistic about the long run. “The good news is the markets are resilient. The markets are going to come back in time. There is no doubt in my mind that we will be significantly higher in the markets in the next 5, 10, 15 or 20 years,” he said. “The question is, what does it look like before we get there? And how many people do we lose?” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

The gloves are off as crypto giant Coinbase fiercely defends itself against a lawsuit from Oregon. Accusing the state of recycling discredited theories and undermining the push for clear federal rules, Coinbase is not backing down. Let’s dive into why this baseless lawsuit is making waves and what it means for the future of crypto regulations. Coinbase Lawsuit: A Clash Over Crypto Regulation Coinbase is hitting back hard against Oregon’s legal challenge, labeling it a ‘baseless attempt to revive discredited legal theories.’ This strong language underscores the company’s frustration and determination to fight what it perceives as an unfair and outdated attack. But what exactly is Oregon alleging, and why is Coinbase so vehemently opposed? Oregon’s Claims: While the specifics of Oregon’s lawsuit haven’t been detailed in the initial reports, Coinbase suggests the state is attempting to apply outdated legal frameworks to the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrency. Coinbase’s Defense: Coinbase argues that these legal theories have already been rejected by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), implying a lack of merit in Oregon’s approach. Undermining Federal Efforts: A key part of Coinbase’s argument is that this lawsuit disrupts the ongoing bipartisan efforts in Washington D.C. to establish clear and consistent federal crypto regulations . This legal battle isn’t just about Coinbase and Oregon; it’s a microcosm of the larger struggle to define and regulate the crypto industry in the United States. The outcome could set precedents and influence how other states and federal agencies approach crypto regulation in the future. Why ‘Baseless Lawsuit’ is Coinbase’s Key Argument Coinbase’s repeated use of the term ‘baseless lawsuit’ isn’t just rhetoric; it’s a strategic legal and public relations move. By framing the Oregon lawsuit as lacking foundation, Coinbase aims to: Discredit the Claims: Immediately cast doubt on the legitimacy of Oregon’s legal action in the eyes of the public and the broader crypto community. Rally Support: Position itself as a victim of overreach, potentially garnering support from industry stakeholders, investors, and even crypto-friendly lawmakers. Strengthen Legal Position: Signal a strong defense and potentially influence the court’s perception of the case from the outset. The ‘baseless’ label is a powerful tool to control the narrative and put pressure on Oregon to justify its legal challenge. It’s a clear indication that Coinbase intends to fight this case aggressively. The SEC Crypto Factor: A History of Discredited Theories? Coinbase’s statement that Oregon is trying to revive legal theories ‘previously abandoned by the U.S. SEC’ is particularly noteworthy. This alludes to past instances where the SEC may have explored certain regulatory approaches to crypto, only to later move away from them. This could mean Oregon is: Using Old Playbooks: Potentially relying on legal interpretations that the federal regulator, the SEC, has deemed ineffective or inappropriate for the current crypto landscape. Ignoring Industry Evolution: Failing to recognize the advancements and changes within the crypto industry since these older theories were considered and possibly discarded. Creating Regulatory Conflict: Risking a conflict with federal regulatory trends if Oregon’s approach diverges significantly from the SEC’s current stance on SEC crypto regulation. Understanding the specific SEC theories Coinbase is referencing will be crucial in assessing the validity of their ‘baseless lawsuit’ claim. It highlights the complexity of navigating state versus federal regulation in the rapidly evolving crypto space. Crypto Regulations in the Crosshairs: Federal vs. State The Coinbase-Oregon standoff throws a spotlight on the ongoing tension between state and federal oversight of crypto regulations . Here’s a breakdown of the key issues: Issue Federal Approach State Approach (Example: Oregon Lawsuit) Consistency Aims for uniform rules across the nation, preventing a patchwork of conflicting state laws. Can lead to regulatory fragmentation, making it harder for crypto businesses to operate nationally. Innovation Ideally balances consumer protection with fostering innovation and growth in the crypto sector. Risk of stifling innovation if state regulations are overly restrictive or misinformed about crypto technology. Expertise Federal agencies like the SEC and CFTC are developing specialized expertise in crypto regulation. State regulators may have varying levels of crypto expertise, potentially leading to less informed regulations. Political Landscape Subject to federal legislative processes, often slower but potentially more comprehensive and bipartisan. State regulations can be influenced by local political climates and may not align with national or global trends. Coinbase’s argument about undermining bipartisan federal efforts emphasizes the industry’s preference for a unified national framework for crypto regulations . They believe that a state-by-state approach, especially one perceived as ‘baseless’ or outdated, creates unnecessary hurdles and uncertainty. What’s Next for Coinbase and Oregon? Coinbase has made it clear: they will ‘fight the case’ while maintaining normal operations in Oregon. This legal battle could unfold in several ways: Court Proceedings: Expect a potentially lengthy legal process involving filings, arguments, and possibly appeals. Settlement的可能性: While Coinbase is projecting a strong stance, settlements are always a possibility in litigation, although unlikely given the strong rhetoric. Legislative Impact: This case could further fuel the debate in Washington about the need for federal crypto legislation, potentially adding urgency to bipartisan efforts. Industry-Wide Implications: The outcome will be closely watched by the entire crypto industry, as it could influence future regulatory challenges and the balance of power between state and federal authorities. A Fight for the Future of Crypto Regulation The Coinbase-Oregon lawsuit is more than just a legal dispute between a company and a state. It’s a significant battleground in the larger war over how cryptocurrency will be regulated in the United States. Coinbase’s aggressive defense and its framing of the Oregon lawsuit as ‘baseless’ signal a determination to push back against what it sees as misguided and obstructive state-level actions. As this case progresses, it will undoubtedly shape the ongoing conversation about crypto regulation and the future of the digital asset industry.

This happened just a few days after the attack was discovered. Instead of using legal threats or launching an investigation, KiloEx tried a different method. This method could set a precedent and change how similar cases are handled. How the Hack Happened On April 14, Cyvers, a blockchain security firm, detected a serious breach on KiloEx. The main problem came from the platform’s price oracle, a tool that gives price updates to the exchange. Sadly, the attacker found a way to manipulate this tool. The attacker exploited the system’s weakness and took advantage of price differences on several blockchains, like BNB, Base, and Taiko. The bad actor siphoned the stolen funds through a wallet on Tornado Cash, a crypto-mixing platform often used for money laundering and hiding stolen funds. The wallet used in the hack received money through Tornado Cash. Tornado Cash is a tool that mixes different crypto transactions to hide where the money comes from. Hackers and criminals often use it to cover their tracks and move stolen money without being caught. This got people worried that the money might be lost forever. However, KiloEx did not give up. Hacker Returns $7.5M, Gets $750,000 Reward Soon after the breach, KiloEx made an unusual proposal. The exchange told the attacker that if the money were returned, it would receive 10% as a reward. This kind of reward, often called a bounty , is typically offered to white-hat hackers, who are ethical hackers who help expose security flaws without harming others. To everyone’s surprise, the attacker returned all the stolen funds. KiloEx said it would be true to its word and give the hacker 10% of the recovered amount, which amounts to $750,000. The company said the reward was a way of thanking the individual for helping improve its security. KiloEx Solves Hack Issue with No Legal Battle Rather than press charges or open a legal case, KiloEx said it considers the issue resolved. The company praised the outcome and emphasized building trust with ethical hackers. The exchange believes that working with security experts is a better way to protect users and grow stronger as a platform. So far this year, hackers and exploiters have stolen about $2 billion from different platforms. In most cases, the funds were never recovered, and the attackers vanished. Yu Xian, a respected figure in blockchain security, said the decision to return the funds and claim the bounty is rare and difficult. However, it might be the smartest option for hackers who realize the damage they could cause.

According to a new report , the three leaders of Braiscompany, which perpetrated the scheme, were sentenced for defrauding investors out of nearly $190 million, or $1.1 billion Brazilian Reals. The report says the company’s main operator, Joel Ferreira de Souza, was handed a sentence of 128 years behind bars, while the other two perpetrators, Gesana Rayane Silva and Victor Augusto Veronez de Souza, were given sentences of 28 and 15 years, respectively. According to authorities, the trio promised “exorbitant” returns on the crypto investments of their victims in order to initially get their funds and engaged in money laundering. Ferreira de Souza was found to be controlling crypto portfolios through third parties, as well as using shell companies to facilitate his crimes. He was convicted of 11 counts of money laundering, while Reyane Silva, the firm’s broker, was found responsible for intermediating financial transactions and transporting funds. De Souza, Joel’s son, was also found guilty of being involved with one of the companies involved in the illegal transactions. The judge in the case said that proceeds from the scam should go directly to the government. However, Artêmio Picanço – the lawyer representing the victims of Braiscompany – argued on one of his social media accounts that the fund should go directly to the victims.

Mid Term Price Prediction For RENDER & TIA,https://bitzo.com/2025/04/render-celestia-kickstart-a-climb-will-the-rally-continue-mid-term-price-prediction-for-render-tia,"Render and Celestia have started showing signs of upward movement in the crypto market. Traders and investors are watching closely, wondering if this momentum will keep building. This article dives into the details and provides a mid-term price forecast for RENDER and TIA, aiming to uncover which of these digital assets might be primed for significant growth. Crypto Price Snapshot and Technical Overview The RENDER experienced a 25% gain over the past month and a 17% boost within the last week. Over a six-month period, the price dropped by 25%, reflecting a mixed performance with sharp short-term rallies contrasted by a longer-term decline. These movements signify rapid shifts in sentiment where recent gains may indicate renewed interest, despite an overall weakness observed in the half-year view. The current trading zone ranges between $2.46 and $4.42, with a key support level at $1.52 and resistance near $5.43 along with a secondary resistance at $7.39. Price action appears delicate with no definitive trend, suggesting bulls may be cautiously testing gains while bears maintain pressure near lower levels. Traders might consider buying near support and monitoring resistance for potential exits. Celestia Price Outlook and Market Levels TIA showed a 26.12% decline over the last month and a 59.19% slide over the past six months, with a small weekly drop of 2.34%. Price moves have been steep and led to marked shifts in sentiment, with volatility defining its recent performance. Indicators point to fading momentum as the market adjusts, highlighting a clear downward trend during these intervals. Current trading sees Celestia moving between $2.31 and $4.17. Resistance sits near $5.28, with a second push expected around $7.14, while support is seen at $1.55. Bears hold sway for now, with the price failing to break higher and a lack of strong directional trend. Cautious trades within these levels could test resistance and find new support at the current key level. Conclusion The recent surge in RENDER and TIA signals a renewed interest in these coins. Market sentiment appears strong, driven by positive developments and community support. While current trends favor continued growth, monitoring broader market conditions is crucial. Both RENDER and TIA have shown potential, but their long-term performance will depend on sustained momentum and adoption. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

It felt like every other company was going public via a Special Purpose Acquisition Company. Then, the hype faded, and SPACs seemed to lose their luster. But hold on – could we be witnessing a surprising SPAC comeback ? Kodiak Robotics, a self-driving truck startup, is making headlines by choosing the SPAC route to the public market, merging with Ares Acquisition Corporation II. This bold move raises eyebrows, especially given the recent struggles and shutdowns in the autonomous vehicle sector, not to mention the generally shaky IPO landscape. Is this a lone wolf, or the start of a new SPAC wave? Let’s unpack this. Is the SPAC Comeback Really Happening? The big question on everyone’s mind: is the SPAC comeback real ? Kodiak Robotics’ decision certainly suggests a pulse in the SPAC world. But it’s happening against a backdrop of considerable uncertainty in the broader IPO market. As highlighted on Bitcoin World’s Equity podcast, featuring Kirsten Korosec, Max Zeff, and Anthony Ha, the expected blockbuster IPO year of 2025 is looking less certain. Major players like Klarna and StubHub have pumped the brakes on their public debut plans. Investor Mark Goldberg even quipped that those waiting for a fintech IPO wave this year might be waiting a long time. So, why SPACs, and why now? Here’s a breakdown of factors at play: Uncertain IPO Market Conditions : Traditional IPOs require extensive roadshows and market confidence. In a volatile market, SPACs offer a potentially faster and more certain path to going public, even if it means negotiating valuation with a SPAC sponsor. SPACs Seeking Deals : Many SPACs raised capital during the boom and are now under pressure to find merger targets before their deadlines expire. This creates a supply of SPACs looking for companies, potentially making it an attractive option for private companies seeking liquidity. Kodiak Robotics’ Bold Bet : For Kodiak, the SPAC route might offer access to capital and public markets at a time when traditional funding rounds are tougher to secure for autonomous vehicle companies, especially after the setbacks of Embark and TuSimple. However, it’s crucial to remember the challenges that led to the SPAC market cooling down in the first place: SPAC Performance History : Post-merger SPAC performance has often been lackluster, with many companies underperforming market expectations. This has made investors wary. Regulatory Scrutiny : Increased regulatory attention on SPACs has added complexity and potentially deterred some companies and investors. Market Saturation : The sheer volume of SPACs in 2021 led to deal fatigue and a decline in investor enthusiasm. Autonomous Vehicles and the IPO Landscape Kodiak Robotics operating in the autonomous vehicles space adds another layer of intrigue. This sector has faced significant headwinds recently. The closures of Embark and TuSimple, mentioned in the original article, underscore the capital-intensive and long-term nature of developing and deploying self-driving technology. Going public via SPAC could be a strategic move for Kodiak to secure funding and visibility in a challenging environment. However, investor sentiment towards autonomous vehicles is currently mixed. While the long-term potential is undeniable, the path to profitability and widespread adoption remains uncertain. Key Considerations for Kodiak Robotics’ SPAC Move: Factor Potential Impact Market Sentiment for Autonomous Vehicles Could be a headwind if investors are still cautious about the sector’s near-term prospects. SPAC Partner (Ares Acquisition Corporation II) A strong and reputable SPAC sponsor can lend credibility and support to the deal. Valuation and Deal Terms Attractive valuation and deal terms are crucial to attract investors and ensure long-term success as a public company. Execution and Roadmap Clear execution plans and a realistic roadmap for commercialization will be vital to maintain investor confidence post-merger. Fintech IPOs: Still on Hold? The article also touches upon the broader fintech IPO landscape, quoting Mark Goldberg’s pessimistic view on an imminent wave. This context is important because it highlights the general hesitancy in the IPO market, not just for tech but specifically for fintech companies which were also darlings of the previous IPO boom. If even fintech giants are delaying public offerings, it underscores the challenging market conditions and makes Kodiak’s SPAC move even more noteworthy – and potentially risky. Other Key Highlights from the Equity Podcast: AI Voices Everywhere : Imagine Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, and Jeff Bezos’s AI voices guiding you at crosswalks. The podcast discussed the increasing pervasiveness of AI voices and its implications. Figma’s IPO Plans : The Equity crew is eagerly anticipating Figma’s S-1 filing, raising questions about its financials, growth strategy, and market positioning. Hugging Face’s Robotics Push : Hugging Face’s recent acquisition signals a deeper dive into humanoid robotics, expanding its AI footprint beyond software models. OpenAI’s Model Updates : Updates to OpenAI’s o3 and o4-mini models, and the anticipation for the grand GPT-5 launch, keep the AI world buzzing with excitement. Conclusion: A Glimmer of Hope or a False Dawn? Kodiak Robotics’ SPAC merger is undoubtedly a significant event. Whether it signals a true SPAC comeback or is merely an outlier remains to be seen. It’s a bold move in an uncertain market, particularly for the autonomous vehicle sector.

Elizabeth Warren,https://cointelegraph.com/news/firing-jerome-powell-crash-financial-markets-elizabeth-warren?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"US Senator Elizabeth Warren warned that if President Donald Trump eventually moves to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, it could undermine investor confidence in the integrity of US capital markets and trigger a financial crash. During an appearance on CNBC, the Massachusetts Senator said the President does not have the legal authority to remove Powell from his position. Moreover, removing Powell would weaken the financial infrastructure of the US, Warren added: ""If Chairman Powell can be fired by the President of the United States, it will crash the markets. The infrastructure that keeps this stock market strong and, therefore, a big part of our economy strong, and a big part of the world economy strong, is the idea that the big pieces move independently of politics."" ""If interest rates in the United States are subject to a president who just wants to wave his magic wand, this doesn't distinguish us from any other two-bit dictatorship,"" Warren continued. Trump discusses US economic policies with reporters. Source: The White House President Trump has repeatedly called for Powell's termination, citing the chairman's hesitancy to lower interest rates . Lower interest rates are usually considered a positive catalyst for risk-on asset prices, including cryptocurrencies, and could reverse the market downturn brought on by the trade war and current macroeconomic pressures. Related: Fed's Powell reasserts support for stablecoin legislation Trump's feud with the Federal Reserve chairman Trump criticized Powell for not cutting interest rates and called for his termination again in an April 17 Truth Social post , which inflamed speculation that he would follow through on threats and find a way to remove the chairman. Senator Rick Scott echoed Trump's calls to remove Powell. ""It’s time to clean house of everyone working at the Federal Reserve who isn’t on board with helping the American people and fighting for their best interests,"" Scott wrote in an opinion piece published on Fox News. Source: Donald Trump The Trump administration has repeatedly stated that lowering interest rates is a top priority. Market analyst and investor Anthony Pompliano recently speculated that Trump deliberately crashed financial markets to force lower interest rates. At the time, Pompliano cited a reduction in the yield of the 10-year US Treasury Bond to just 4%. The 10-year bond yield has climbed back up to 4.3% since then.

43503746,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=150813,1745014817,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Smarter ChatGPT: Revolutionizing Web Searches with Personalized Memory,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/smarter-chatgpt-personalized-search/,"For cryptocurrency enthusiasts always seeking the edge in market analysis and information gathering, the latest advancements in AI are not just interesting—they’re game-changing. OpenAI’s ChatGPT is pushing boundaries again, this time with a groundbreaking update that’s set to redefine how we interact with AI for web searches. Imagine an AI chatbot that not only understands your queries but also remembers your preferences, your past interactions, and uses this ‘memory’ to tailor web search results just for you. This isn’t science fiction; it’s the reality of ChatGPT’s new ‘Memory with Search’ feature, and it’s poised to make your information gathering faster, more relevant, and incredibly personalized. Unveiling ChatGPT’s Personalized Search : What’s New? OpenAI has just rolled out a significant enhancement to ChatGPT’s capabilities, dubbed ‘Memory with Search.’ This isn’t just a minor tweak; it’s a fundamental upgrade to how ChatGPT processes and responds to your queries, especially when those queries involve web searches. Building on its existing memory capabilities, this new feature allows ChatGPT to leverage details from your past conversations to refine and personalize your web search experience. Think of it as having a digital assistant that truly ‘knows’ you and uses that knowledge to get you the most relevant information from the vast expanse of the internet. Here’s a breakdown of what ‘Memory with Search’ brings to the table: Context-Aware Searches: ChatGPT now uses its ChatGPT memory of your previous conversations to understand the context of your current search. This means it doesn’t just treat each query in isolation but as part of an ongoing dialogue. Personalized Query Refinement: When you ask ChatGPT to search the web, it can rewrite your prompt to be more effective, incorporating details it remembers about you. This leads to search queries that are inherently more tailored to your needs and preferences. Seamless Integration: This feature is designed to work smoothly within the existing ChatGPT interface. If you’ve used ChatGPT’s memory feature before, ‘Memory with Search’ is a natural and powerful extension of that. This update is a clear move by OpenAI to distinguish ChatGPT from competitors like Claude and Gemini, both of which are also developing memory features. OpenAI is doubling down on creating a truly personalized and efficient AI chatbot experience. How Does Memory with Search Actually Work? Let’s dive into a practical example to illustrate the power of ‘Memory with Search.’ Imagine you’ve previously mentioned to ChatGPT that you’re interested in blockchain technology and live in London. Now, you ask ChatGPT, ‘What are some upcoming tech events near me?’ With ‘Memory with Search,’ ChatGPT doesn’t just perform a generic search. Instead, it intelligently rewrites your query, leveraging its ChatGPT memory . It might transform your simple question into a more specific search query like, ‘blockchain technology events London 2025.’ OpenAI provides another compelling example in their documentation: Consider a user who ChatGPT remembers is vegan and lives in San Francisco. If this user prompts, ‘what are some restaurants near me that I’d like,’ ChatGPT, with ‘Memory with Search,’ might refine this to ‘good vegan restaurants, San Francisco.’ This level of personalization ensures that the search results are not only geographically relevant but also aligned with your dietary preferences, making the information far more useful and less time-consuming to sift through. The Benefits of Personalized Search in the AI Era For users, especially those in fast-paced fields like cryptocurrency trading and analysis, the benefits of personalized search are substantial: Enhanced Relevance: Say goodbye to sifting through pages of irrelevant search results. ‘Memory with Search’ significantly increases the relevance of information you receive, saving you valuable time. Improved Efficiency: By understanding your context and preferences, ChatGPT streamlines the search process. You get to the information you need faster, allowing for quicker decision-making. More Intuitive Interaction: Conversing with ChatGPT becomes more natural and intuitive. It feels less like interacting with a machine and more like having a knowledgeable assistant who anticipates your needs. Competitive Edge: In dynamic markets like cryptocurrency, access to timely and highly relevant information is crucial. Personalized search can provide that edge, helping you stay ahead of market trends and make informed decisions faster. OpenAI Update : Differentiating ChatGPT in a Crowded Market The ‘Memory with Search’ feature is a strategic move by OpenAI update to further differentiate ChatGPT from its competitors. In a market increasingly crowded with sophisticated AI chatbots, standing out requires continuous innovation and user-centric features. By enhancing the ChatGPT memory capabilities and integrating them with web search, OpenAI is setting a new benchmark for personalized AI interactions. While Google’s Gemini and Anthropic’s Claude also offer memory features, OpenAI’s approach with ‘Memory with Search’ seems to be taking personalization a step further by directly influencing and refining the web search process itself. This is not just about remembering past conversations; it’s about actively using that memory to improve the quality and relevance of information retrieved from the web. Are There Any Concerns? Navigating the Challenges As with any AI advancement, especially one that involves ChatGPT memory and personalization, there are valid questions and potential concerns: Privacy: Users might be concerned about what personal information ChatGPT stores in its memory and how this data is used to personalize searches. OpenAI needs to be transparent about data handling and ensure robust privacy protections. Accuracy and Bias: Relying on past conversations to refine searches could introduce biases or inaccuracies if the initial memories are flawed or if the AI misinterprets past interactions. Continuous refinement and user feedback will be crucial to mitigate these risks. Control and Customization: Users need to have control over their ChatGPT memory . The ability to easily disable ‘Memory with Search,’ as mentioned in OpenAI’s documentation, is essential. Furthermore, granular control over what is remembered and used for personalization would be a welcome addition. OpenAI has already addressed the control aspect by allowing users to disable Memory in settings, giving users the option to opt out of personalized search if they prefer. Actionable Insights: Making the Most of Memory with Search Ready to leverage the power of Memory with Search ? Here are some actionable insights to get you started: Engage in Detailed Conversations: The richer your conversations with ChatGPT, the more comprehensive its memory becomes, leading to better personalized search results. Don’t hesitate to provide context and details in your interactions. Experiment with Different Queries: Try using ‘Memory with Search’ for various types of web searches to see how it refines and personalizes the results. Experiment with broad and specific queries to understand its capabilities fully. Review and Manage Your Memory: Regularly check your ChatGPT settings to manage your memory preferences. Ensure you are comfortable with the level of personalization and adjust settings as needed. Provide Feedback: As an early adopter, your feedback is invaluable. If you encounter issues or have suggestions for improvement, provide feedback to OpenAI to help refine this feature further. Conclusion: A Smarter, More Personalized AI Future OpenAI’s ‘Memory with Search’ is more than just an incremental OpenAI update ; it’s a significant leap towards creating truly intelligent and personalized AI assistants. By integrating ChatGPT memory with web search capabilities, OpenAI is paving the way for a future where AI interactions are not only more efficient but also deeply attuned to individual user needs and preferences. For those in the cryptocurrency and broader tech space, this advancement promises a smarter, faster, and more personalized way to navigate the vast digital landscape. As AI continues to evolve, features like ‘Memory with Search’ will be pivotal in shaping how we interact with and benefit from these powerful technologies.

Leading cryptocurrency exchange , Kraken, has just amplified its trading platform by introducing FX perpetual futures trading . Yes, you heard it right! Kraken Pro users can now dive into the dynamic world of forex markets, starting with the ever-popular EUR/USD and GBP/USD currency pairs. This move signifies a major expansion for Kraken, venturing beyond its core crypto offerings to tap into the vast potential of foreign exchange. Unveiling Kraken’s FX Perpetual Futures: What’s the Buzz? For those unfamiliar, perpetual futures are derivative contracts that, unlike traditional futures, don’t have an expiration date. This means you can hold positions indefinitely, mirroring the spot market but with the added leverage and flexibility of futures trading. Kraken’s foray into FX perpetual futures is a game-changer for several reasons: 24/7 Trading Access: Say goodbye to market closure limitations! Forex markets are renowned for their 24/5 operation, but Kraken is taking it a step further by offering 24/7 trading . This caters to the global nature of crypto and forex traders who operate across different time zones and prefer continuous market access. Diversification Beyond Crypto: Kraken, primarily known as a cryptocurrency exchange , is strategically diversifying its product range. By adding FX pairs, Kraken is appealing to a broader audience, including traditional forex traders who might be looking to explore crypto or simply want a platform that offers both. Leverage Opportunities: Perpetual futures inherently offer leverage, allowing traders to control larger positions with a smaller amount of capital. While leverage can amplify profits, it’s crucial to remember it also magnifies risks. Responsible risk management is key! Competitive Edge: By launching FX perpetual futures , Kraken is positioning itself to compete with established forex brokers and other crypto exchanges that may also offer FX products. This move could attract traders seeking a unified platform for both crypto and forex trading. Why Forex and Why Now for Kraken? The foreign exchange market is the largest and most liquid financial market globally, dwarfing even the stock markets in trading volume. The appeal of forex lies in its: High Liquidity: With trillions of dollars traded daily, forex markets offer unparalleled liquidity, ensuring tight spreads and efficient order execution. Volatility: Currency values are influenced by a multitude of factors – economic indicators, geopolitical events, interest rate changes, and more. This volatility presents numerous trading opportunities. Global Participation: Forex is a truly global market, with participants ranging from central banks and financial institutions to multinational corporations and individual traders worldwide. For Kraken, venturing into forex is a logical step to expand its market reach and cater to the evolving needs of its user base. The timing is also strategic, as interest in both crypto and forex markets remains robust, and traders are increasingly looking for comprehensive platforms that offer diverse trading instruments. Navigating the FX Perpetual Futures Landscape on Kraken Pro Kraken Pro users will find the new FX perpetual futures pairs integrated seamlessly into the platform. Here’s a quick guide on what to expect: Feature Details for FX Perpetual Futures on Kraken Pro Trading Pairs (Initial) EUR/USD, GBP/USD Trading Hours 24/7 Platform Kraken Pro Contract Type Perpetual Futures Leverage (Specific leverage details to be confirmed on Kraken Pro – traders should check platform for latest information) Actionable Insights for Traders: Explore the New Pairs: If you are a Kraken Pro user interested in forex, take advantage of the new EUR/USD and GBP/USD pairs. Familiarize yourself with their trading characteristics and volatility. Risk Management is Paramount: Especially with leveraged products like perpetual futures, robust risk management strategies are crucial. Use stop-loss orders and manage your position sizes wisely. Stay Informed: Forex markets are driven by global events. Keep abreast of economic news, central bank announcements, and geopolitical developments that can impact currency values. Platform Familiarization: If you’re new to Kraken Pro or futures trading, take time to explore the platform, understand the order types, and leverage settings before trading live. Challenges and Considerations While Kraken’s move into Forex trading is exciting, there are factors to consider: Competition: The forex market is highly competitive, with numerous established brokers. Kraken will need to differentiate itself to attract and retain forex traders. Regulatory Landscape: Regulations surrounding forex and crypto derivatives can vary across jurisdictions. Kraken needs to navigate these complexities to ensure compliance and global accessibility. Education and Support: Some crypto traders may be new to forex, and vice versa. Kraken might need to invest in educational resources and support to help users navigate this new offering effectively. Market Volatility: Both crypto and forex markets can be volatile. Traders need to be prepared for rapid price swings and manage their risk accordingly. Conclusion: A Bold Step into a Broader Trading Universe Kraken’s launch of 24/7 FX perpetual futures trading is undoubtedly a significant step forward. It demonstrates the exchange’s ambition to become a comprehensive trading platform, bridging the gap between the crypto and traditional financial worlds. By offering forex trading alongside its robust crypto offerings, Kraken is providing traders with more opportunities, greater flexibility, and access to a wider range of markets. As the platform evolves and potentially adds more FX pairs and features, it will be interesting to watch how this bold move shapes Kraken’s future and the broader trading landscape.

But here’s the real question on investors’ minds: If you’re putting $100 or $1,000 into the market right now—what’s delivering the best return by 2026? That’s where MAGACOINFINANCE is entering the conversation with hard ROI math that’s too good to ignore . 🚨 FINAL CALL — ACT NOW & SECURE YOUR SPOT! The ROI Breakdown – $1,000 in 2025 Could Look Very Different Let’s say you’re investing $1,000 today. Here’s how it could play out: BTC at 2x → $1,000 becomes $2,000 XRP at 4x → $1,000 becomes $4,000 ETH at 3x–4x → $1,000 becomes up to $4,000 ADA and LINK → both projected around 3x returns SUI → high-growth potential, possibly 5x Now compare that to MAGACOINFINANCE , which has been forecasted by early-stage investors and analysts to deliver 25x or more in its upcoming cycle . MAGACOINFINANCE at 25x → $1,000 becomes $25,000 That’s the kind of math that creates life-changing portfolio shifts—not just solid gains. 📈 2025’S MOST TALKED ABOUT CRYPTO — JOIN 12,500+ INVESTORS TODAY! Why MAGACOINFINANCE Could Outperform Every Top 10 Coin Unlike BTC and ETH, which have already gone through multiple exponential growth phases, MAGACOINFINANCE is still in its pre-mainstream launch window . It’s gaining traction rapidly across social channels, crypto newsletters, and Telegram investor groups—and it’s offering pre-listing access + bonus incentives like MAGA50X . The ROI formula is simple: early + structured + low market cap = outsized returns . 🔓 50% EXTRA BONUS LIVE — USE CODE MAGA50X BEFORE IT’S GONE! What About ADA, ETH, LINK, and SUI? All strong contenders for long-term performance. Cardano (ADA) offers reliability in DeFi. Ethereum (ETH) continues to dominate infrastructure-level innovation.

But here’s the truth: none of them are offering the 25x potential of MAGACOINFINANCE right now—and that’s what ROI-focused investors are prioritizing in 2025. Conclusion BTC, XRP, and ETH are still ranked at the top—but in terms of pure upside potential, MAGACOINFINANCE is in a category of its own . For investors looking to turn $100 into something serious, the ROI math makes the choice obvious.

Crypto Twitter’s been buzzing lately—and not for the usual suspects. While most of the market is still playing cautious, meme coins like DEGEN are picking up traction fast, and PONKE is almost at full token circulation, signaling a rare early-bird advantage for those watching closely. The energy is unmistakable—new players are moving in as the top new meme coins to join today, whales are loading up, and momentum is shifting in real time. Right at the center of this resurgence sits BTFD Coin (BTFD) —the one meme coin that’s not just hyped, but heavily loaded with substance, features, and undeniable numbers. In a sea of volatility, presales like BTFD keep you safe from market swings, giving you entry at set pricing while the storm rages outside. The BTFD presale has already become a rallying point for over 11,800+ holders, raising more than $6.54 million and selling over 72 billion coins.

These top new meme coins to join today might just be your ticket to crypto’s next wave of breakout wealth. BTFD Coin (BTFD): Is This Your $1K Into $30K Moment?

In a space that usually runs on nothing but hype, BTFD is stacking real fundamentals behind the frenzy. Backed by a live P2E game, 90% APY staking rewards, and a community that’s growing by the hour, BTFD isn’t just another meme coin presale —it’s a movement among the top new meme coins to join today and win big. Let’s talk numbers for a sec. Buying in at $0.0002 during Stage 15, a $1,000 investment nets you 5 million BTFD coins. At listing, that becomes $3,000 at the projected $0.0006 launch price. But here’s the kicker—analysts see BTFD hitting a moonshot target of $0.006 in this bull cycle. That’s a 2900% ROI. Your same bag? It could balloon to $30,000. This is the kind of upside early DOGE and SHIBA believers now brag about. And that’s just the start. At the heart of this revolution is the Bulls Squad—a cast of characters that turns every token holder into part of a tight-knit mission. From Baby Bull to Nerdy Bull, this isn’t just branding—it’s identity. BTFD isn’t about aping trends, it’s about creating a tribe that plays to win.

DEGEN: Growing Buzz and Real Community Firepower While BTFD is dominating presale headlines, DEGEN is making waves in the broader market. Currently priced at $0.00229, DEGEN has seen a 5.35% daily jump, backed by a 24-hour trading volume of over $11.4 million and a market cap nearing $32.5 million. But this isn’t just hype—it’s backed by a vibrant, ever-expanding community born from the Farcaster Degen channel. DEGEN has gone from meme coin joke to ecosystem favorite, with its own Layer 3 blockchain and real dev engagement. With over 14.18 billion DEGEN in circulation, the project has nearly tapped its max supply—meaning early movers now have limited competition. For traders looking to ride the next sentiment spike, DEGEN’s current price window is one worth watching. PONKE: Maxed Supply and Meme Power on Solana Another token making headlines is PONKE, the offbeat meme project built on Solana. Priced at $0.0785, PONKE boasts a market cap of $43.6 million and nearly 100% of its supply already in circulation—555.54 million out of 555.56 million. That’s as close to fully diluted as it gets, making scarcity a huge part of the appeal. While PONKE doesn’t push traditional utility, its strong branding and cult following have made it a magnet for degen traders. Its status on Solana and the “no fluff, just vibes” approach to community keeps interest growing—even without staking or P2E rewards. It’s for those who want meme energy and volatility, with the bonus of a capped token supply. Final Word: These Meme Coins Could Make the Next Wave—But One’s Already Surging This market doesn’t wait for anyone—and the top new meme coins to join today are already drawing in the early believers. DEGEN is warming up with its growing ecosystem and user base, PONKE is riding high on near-zero dilution and maxed-out supply, but BTFD Coin is the real storm brewing. Based on recent data and analyst sentiment, the BTFD hype is not just noise. It’s backed by presale strength, product utility, and a cult-like community that’s built differently.

According to the SEC filing , the Canary Staked TRX ETF will track Tron (TRX) and enable investors to earn passively through the blockchain’s staking feature. The filing noted that CSC Delaware Trust will act as the trustee of the Canary Staked TRX ETF, while BitGo Trust Company will act as the custodian of the fund. Meanwhile, Canary Capital has yet to disclose the fund’s management fee and ticker, thus signing more filing amendments in the near future. Canary Capital Pushes for Crypto ETFs Canary Capital has heavily capitalized on the positive crypto regulatory outlook under the Donald Trump administration. As Coinpedia reported, Canary Capital has filed with the U.S. SEC to offer several spot ETFs. Canary Capital’s notable filings for spot ETF approvals include Sui (SUI), Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), Solana (SOL), XRP, and Hedera (HBAR). Impact on the TRX Market The filing of the Canary Staked TRX ETF is an indication of the rising demand for Tron coin among institutional investors. Moreover, the large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $22.8 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of around $464 million, has been signaling a potential upsurge after a bullish breakout. In the daily timeframe, TRX price has already formed a higher high and is currently attempting to establish a support level around 24 cents a consistent close above 24 cents and the 50-day Moving Average (MA) will fuel a bullish uproar towards 30 cents. Bigger Picture The Tron network has grown to a vibrant DeFi ecosystem, with more than $4.9 billion in total value locked and over $68 billion in stablecoins market cap. According to market data from Defillama, the Tron network recorded nearly 2.3 million active addresses in the past 24 hours, thus a chain revenue of around $1.82 million. The Tron network has gradually re-entered the United States market in the past few months after geoblocking during the Biden administration.",News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|TRX,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-18 22:34:48
43504329,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=150824,1745016002,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Crypto Alert: Binance Unleashes BANK/USDT Perpetual Contract with 50x Leverage,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/binance-launches-bank-usdt-contract/,"Get ready for another exciting opportunity in the crypto futures market! Binance, a leading global cryptocurrency exchange, has just dropped a bombshell announcement that’s sure to pique the interest of traders everywhere. They’re expanding their perpetual futures offerings with a brand new contract: BANK/USDT . This latest addition promises to bring increased trading possibilities and leverage for Binance users. Let’s dive into the details of this exciting launch and see what it means for you. What is the New Binance Futures BANK/USDT Perpetual Contract? Binance Futures is constantly evolving to provide its users with a diverse and dynamic trading environment. The introduction of the BANK/USDT perpetual contract is a testament to this commitment. Scheduled to go live on April 18th at 18:30 UTC , this new contract will allow traders to speculate on the price movements of the BANK token against USDT (Tether) without an expiration date. But what exactly does this mean for you as a trader? Perpetual Futures: Unlike traditional futures contracts that have an expiry date, perpetual futures contracts, like the new BANK/USDT offering, allow you to hold positions indefinitely. This means you can potentially profit from price movements over the long term without needing to worry about contract rollovers on a specific date. Trading Pair: BANK/USDT: This specific pair allows you to trade BANK, potentially the native token of a specific banking or financial project (further research into the specific BANK token is recommended before trading), against USDT, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. This pairing provides a direct and liquid market for trading BANK. Launch Date & Time: Mark your calendars! The BANK/USDT perpetual contract goes live on April 18th at 18:30 UTC. Be ready to jump in and explore the new trading opportunities as soon as it launches. Unlocking 50x Leverage in Crypto Leverage Trading One of the most significant features of the new BANK/USDT perpetual contract is the availability of up to 50x leverage . But what does leverage mean in the context of crypto leverage trading , and how can it impact your trading strategy? Leverage in trading is essentially using borrowed capital to increase your potential trading size. With 50x leverage, you can control a position worth 50 times your initial margin. While this can amplify your potential profits, it’s crucial to understand that it also magnifies your potential losses. Crypto leverage trading is a powerful tool, but it requires careful risk management and a solid understanding of market dynamics. Example of 50x Leverage: Let’s say you have $100 USDT and you want to trade the BANK/USDT perpetual contract with 50x leverage. Scenario Without Leverage With 50x Leverage Capital $100 USDT $100 USDT Position Size You Can Control $100 USDT $5,000 USDT (50 x $100) If BANK/USDT price increases by 1% Profit: $1 Profit: $50 If BANK/USDT price decreases by 1% Loss: $1 Loss: $50 As you can see, leverage can significantly increase both potential gains and losses. It’s vital to use leverage responsibly and within your risk tolerance, especially in the volatile cryptocurrency market. Proper risk management techniques, such as stop-loss orders, are highly recommended when engaging in crypto leverage trading . Multi-Asset Mode: Expanding Your Trading Flexibility Binance is also introducing multi-asset mode support for the BANK/USDT perpetual contract . This feature adds another layer of flexibility and convenience for traders. What does multi-asset mode mean, and how does it benefit you? Multi-asset mode allows you to use various cryptocurrencies as margin for your BANK/USDT perpetual contract trades. Traditionally, you would need to hold USDT in your futures wallet to trade USDT-margined contracts. However, with multi-asset mode, you might be able to use other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), or other supported assets as collateral. Benefits of Multi-Asset Mode: Increased Convenience: You don’t necessarily need to convert your crypto holdings to USDT before trading the BANK/USDT perpetual contract . If you already hold BTC or ETH, you might be able to use them directly as margin. Potential Margin Diversification: Using different assets as margin can potentially diversify your risk and margin requirements. Flexibility in Asset Utilization: Multi-asset mode gives you more flexibility in how you utilize your cryptocurrency holdings for trading. The specific assets supported in multi-asset mode for the BANK/USDT perpetual contract will be detailed by Binance upon launch. Traders should check the official Binance announcement or platform for the complete list of accepted margin assets. Futures Copy Trading: Learn and Potentially Profit from Experienced Traders For those who are newer to crypto leverage trading or looking to learn from experienced traders, Binance will also be enabling futures copy trading for the BANK/USDT perpetual contract within 24 hours of its launch. Futures copy trading is a powerful tool that allows you to automatically copy the trades of selected experienced traders. How Futures Copy Trading Works: Choose Traders to Follow: Binance’s futures copy trading platform will likely provide a list of experienced traders with their trading history, performance metrics, and risk scores. You can choose to follow traders who align with your trading style and risk tolerance. Allocate Funds: You decide how much capital you want to allocate to copy trading and which traders you want to follow. Automatic Trade Copying: Once set up, whenever the traders you follow execute a trade on the BANK/USDT perpetual contract (or other supported contracts), the same trade will be automatically executed in your account proportionally to your allocated funds. Benefits of Futures Copy Trading: Learn from Experienced Traders: Futures copy trading can be an excellent way for beginners to learn trading strategies and market analysis by observing and mirroring the actions of seasoned traders. Potentially Generate Passive Income: If you choose successful traders to follow, futures copy trading can potentially generate passive income without requiring constant monitoring and trading yourself. Time-Saving: For those who have limited time to dedicate to active trading, futures copy trading offers a hands-off approach to participate in the market. Important Considerations for Futures Copy Trading: Past Performance is Not Indicative of Future Results: While following successful traders can be beneficial, remember that past performance is not a guarantee of future profits. Market conditions can change, and even experienced traders can have losing streaks. Risk Management is Still Crucial: Even with futures copy trading , you still need to manage your risk. Carefully select traders to follow, understand their risk profiles, and consider using risk management tools like stop-loss orders on your copied trades. Do Your Own Research: Don’t blindly follow traders without understanding their strategies and risk levels. Do your own research and choose traders whose approaches align with your financial goals and risk tolerance. Conclusion: Embrace New Opportunities with Binance’s BANK/USDT Contract The launch of the BANK/USDT perpetual contract on Binance Futures presents a fresh and exciting opportunity for cryptocurrency traders. With up to 50x leverage, multi-asset mode , and upcoming futures copy trading functionality, Binance continues to innovate and expand its platform to meet the evolving needs of the crypto community. Whether you’re an experienced trader looking to capitalize on leverage or a newcomer eager to learn through copy trading, the BANK/USDT perpetual contract offers something for everyone.

Repeal of the SEC’s custody bulletin has drawn traditional finance back to bitcoin. Trump‑linked crypto ventures add another layer to market dynamics. Long‑term growth will hinge on the shape of new U.S. digital‑asset rules. In an April 17 interview with CNBC, CleanSpark CEO Zachary Bradford said President Donald Trump’s policies have been a ‘net positive’ for digital assets. He attributed the momentum to fresh institutional interest triggered by Congress’s repeal of SEC bulletin SAB 121 earlier this month. Trump’s Second Term Is A Net Positive, CleanSpark CEO Says “Since the administration took office, it’s been a net positive for our industry and a lot of this comes from the regulatory landscape,” Bradford told CNBC’s Talia Kaplan on Thursday . “In the prior years, you know the Bitcoin industry and the crypto industry as a whole, we had a lot of headwinds that we were facing,” Bradford continued. “We find ourselves with some tailwinds at this point.” The crypto entrepreneur pointed to the repeal of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) controversial bulletin, SAB121 – which required financial institutions custodying digital assets to list them as liabilities on their balance sheet – as having the “highest impact” for the crypto sector. SAB 121 being repealed may be the most important domino to fall for #Bitcoin under the new administration. It will now be easier for major financial institutions to participate in the future of finance. — Zach Bradford (@ZachKBradford) January 23, 2025 “As a result, there’s now more traditional institutions becoming interested in holding Bitcoin and interacting with it,” he added. Trump Sons Invest in New BTC Mining Operation Bradford’s comments come just weeks after crypto infrastructure firm Hut 8 announced that it would be launching Bitcoin mining firm American Bitcoin with investments from Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. American Bitcoin is here. Join us for the official launch presentation tomorrow, April 1 at 8:30 am ET to hear co-founder @EricTrump and the @Hut8Corp leadership team discuss our vision and strategy for the company. We will also be hosting a Space tomorrow at 3:00 pm ET (stay… pic.twitter.com/5FfyFWkAf9 — American Bitcoin (@AmericanBTC) March 31, 2025 When asked by Kaplan if he was “fazed” by the Trump-affiliated crypto company’s most recent announcement, Bradford reaffirmed that CleanSpark would “continue doing what we do best” as the Bitcoin miner “with the highest operational excellence in the industry.” “The scale we’re operating at will take a long time for anybody to catch up on,” he said. Whether Bradford’s vision materializes now hinges on the substance of America’s forthcoming crypto rulebook: clear guardrails could channel mainstream capital into Bitcoin mining and beyond, while prolonged regulatory drift risks eroding the very tailwinds he sees today. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What impact did SAB 121 have on financial institutions before its repeal? Government-held bitcoin from forfeitures is pooled into a non-selling reserve subject to audits and management guidelines. It diversifies assets without new spending but prompts concerns over liquidity and governance. What challenges remain for institutional crypto adoption despite recent rule changes? Even after SAB 121’s repeal, firms must address SAB 122 requirements, evolving SEC and CFTC roles, and secure custody systems. Regulatory gaps and varied state laws continue to complicate institutional entry. How do White House crypto policies influence mining operations and market sentiment? By issuing supportive orders and engaging regulators, the White House improved market outlook and helped miners secure capital for expansion. Yet, mining investment and sentiment remain sensitive to future policy clarity.

43504948,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=150826,1745017254,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin Dominance Soars to 64%: Alarming Sign for Altcoins or Crypto Market Revolution?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-dominance-crypto-market-2/,"The cryptocurrency market is buzzing with a significant shift: Bitcoin dominance is back in the spotlight, surging to levels not seen since the early days of 2021. This resurgence has sparked a wave of discussions and analyses across the crypto community. Is this a temporary blip, a sign of a new bull run focused solely on Bitcoin, or a potential threat to the broader altcoin ecosystem? Let’s delve into what’s driving this trend and what it could mean for your crypto portfolio. What Exactly is Bitcoin Dominance and Why Does it Matter? In simple terms, Bitcoin dominance refers to the ratio of Bitcoin’s market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies. A higher Bitcoin dominance percentage indicates that Bitcoin constitutes a larger portion of the overall crypto market value. Why is this important? Because it often serves as a barometer for the health and direction of the entire crypto market, and especially the relationship between Bitcoin and altcoins. Market Sentiment Indicator: Rising Bitcoin dominance can suggest a ‘flight to safety’ where investors are moving capital into the perceived stability of Bitcoin amidst market uncertainty. Altcoin Performance Gauge: Conversely, a declining Bitcoin dominance usually signals a growing interest and capital flow into altcoins, often during periods of broader market exuberance and higher risk appetite. Capital Rotation Insights: Monitoring Bitcoin dominance helps understand potential capital rotation trends within the crypto market – are funds flowing into Bitcoin or diversifying into altcoins? Bitcoin Dominance Analysis: Hitting Levels Unseen Since 2021 Recent data reveals that Bitcoin dominance has indeed reached 64%, a peak not experienced since early 2021. This significant climb, as highlighted by BeInCrypto, is raising eyebrows and prompting analysts to dissect the underlying factors. Let’s break down the key observations: Steady Uptrend: Excluding stablecoins from the calculation, Bitcoin dominance is even higher, nearing 69%. This indicates a consistent upward trend since late 2022, suggesting this isn’t just a short-term fluctuation. Potential Altcoin Pressure: Some analysts caution that if Bitcoin dominance surpasses the 66% mark, it could spell further trouble for altcoins. Historically, such levels have been associated with periods of significant altcoin underperformance. Stablecoin Dominance as a Counter-Signal?: Interestingly, some experts are also watching resistance zones in stablecoin dominance. A decrease in stablecoin dominance, coupled with rising Bitcoin dominance, might indicate capital rotation from stablecoins into Bitcoin, potentially signaling a more bullish outlook for Bitcoin itself. To put this in perspective, consider the following table illustrating historical Bitcoin dominance trends: Period Bitcoin Dominance (Approx.) Market Condition Early 2021 64% (Previous Peak) Early Bull Market Phase Mid-2021 ~40% (Local Bottom) Altcoin Season Peak Late 2022 ~39% (Recent Low) Bear Market Lows Present (Late 2023) 64% (Current High) Market Recovery/Uncertainty Is This an Alarming Sign for Altcoins? For altcoin holders, the surge in market dominance of Bitcoin might feel concerning. A consistently rising Bitcoin dominance can indeed indicate a period where altcoins underperform Bitcoin. Here’s why: Risk-Off Sentiment: In times of market uncertainty or fear, investors often gravitate towards Bitcoin as the oldest and most established cryptocurrency, reducing exposure to the perceived higher risk of altcoins. Liquidity Preference: Bitcoin boasts the highest liquidity in the crypto market. During downturns or corrections, traders and investors may prefer to hold Bitcoin for easier entry and exit points. Narrative Focus: Sometimes, market narratives shift to favor Bitcoin-specific developments (like ETF approvals, institutional adoption) diverting attention and capital away from altcoin narratives. However, it’s crucial to remember that the crypto market is dynamic. History shows that altcoin seasons often follow periods of Bitcoin dominance. A high Bitcoin dominance could be setting the stage for a future altcoin rally, as capital eventually rotates seeking higher growth potential in smaller cap cryptocurrencies. Crypto Market Revolution or Just a Phase? Understanding Capital Rotation The concept of capital rotation is vital for understanding market cycles in crypto. It describes the movement of investment capital between different asset classes or sectors within the crypto market. In the context of Bitcoin dominance, we often see a cyclical pattern: Bitcoin Accumulation Phase: Early stages of a bull market often see Bitcoin leading the charge, with investors initially focusing on the ‘blue-chip’ crypto. Bitcoin dominance tends to rise. Altcoin Speculation Phase: As the bull market matures, profits from Bitcoin may flow into altcoins, seeking higher percentage gains. This is often termed ‘altcoin season,’ and Bitcoin dominance may decline. Market Correction/Consolidation: During market corrections or bear markets, capital often flows back to Bitcoin and stablecoins for safety, increasing Bitcoin dominance again. Therefore, the current rise in Bitcoin dominance could be interpreted in multiple ways: Pre-Altcoin Season Setup?: It could be a necessary phase before another altcoin season. Bitcoin might be absorbing capital before a broader market rally encompassing altcoins. Flight to Quality Amidst Uncertainty?: It could reflect ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties or regulatory concerns pushing investors towards the relative safety of Bitcoin. Bitcoin-Specific Catalysts?: Developments like potential spot Bitcoin ETF approvals in the US could be driving increased demand specifically for Bitcoin, boosting its dominance. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Bitcoin Dominance Landscape So, what can crypto investors do amidst this rising Bitcoin dominance? Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Dominance Charts: Keep an eye on Bitcoin dominance charts and stablecoin dominance charts. These can provide early signals of potential shifts in market sentiment and capital flows. Diversify Strategically: Maintain a diversified portfolio, but consider adjusting allocations based on your risk tolerance and market outlook. During periods of high Bitcoin dominance, a slightly higher Bitcoin allocation might be prudent for some investors. Research Altcoin Fundamentals: If you are invested in altcoins, focus on projects with strong fundamentals, real-world use cases, and active development. These are more likely to weather periods of Bitcoin dominance and potentially outperform when altcoin interest returns. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with crypto news, Bitcoin analysis , and market trends. Understanding the narratives driving market movements is crucial for making informed investment decisions. Conclusion: The Evolving Narrative of Bitcoin Dominance Bitcoin’s surging market dominance to 64% is undoubtedly a significant development in the current crypto landscape. While it might raise concerns for altcoin enthusiasts in the short term, it’s essential to view it within the broader context of market cycles and capital rotation . Whether this marks the beginning of a Bitcoin-centric bull run or a prelude to another explosive altcoin season remains to be seen. For now, astute investors will be closely monitoring these trends, adapting their strategies, and preparing for the next exciting chapter in the ever-evolving crypto story. The market is constantly in flux, and understanding these shifts is key to navigating the world of digital assets successfully.

This guide delves into where these cryptocurrencies are headed in the coming months. Discover which ones are poised for growth and the crucial support levels to watch. Curious about the next big move? Dive into the analysis ahead. Hedera HBAR Dynamics: Short-Term Dips Amid Long-Term Surge and Key Levels Hedera price fell about 12% over the past month while climbing over 211% across six months. Volatility marked the recent decline, contrasting with a sustained rally that drove long-term gains. Sharp short-term corrections followed months of bullish buildup, showing the coin's ability for rapid movements and high potential. Recent setbacks provide opportunities for recovery. The coin now trades between $0.1166 and $0.2485, with resistance near $0.3343 and secondary resistance at $0.4662, while support holds around $0.0705 dollars. Mixed indicators, such as an RSI near 47 and slight momentum, suggest no clear trend, indicating both bulls and bears share control. Traders may explore breakouts above resistance or look for rebounds at support to guide decisions. VeChain Market Update: Recent Trends and Key Price Levels VeChain dropped 7.56% over the past month while showing a modest 5.02% rise over the last six months. A strong 14.58% one-week gain added a burst of energy during a period marked by mixed performance. Price swings revealed short-term strength amid longer-term caution, with movements varying as traders reacted to market shifts. Technical measures indicated a balance between upward pressure and correction across different time frames. Current trading lies between $0.01797 and $0.03102. A resistance level is near $0.03891 with clear support at $0.01282. Bulls have pushed prices higher in the short term, but recent monthly losses suggest caution. With no clear long-term trend, traders might consider buying near support and watching for a breakout above resistance. Ethena Trading: Bearish Trends and Key Levels to Watch Over the past month, Ethena dropped by nearly 24%, while a six-month decline reached around 30%. Price losses have accumulated gradually, with technical measures like a 41.35 RSI and a slightly negative Oscillator contributing to the downward pressure. This sustained decrease cautions investors against expecting an immediate recovery. Current levels set immediate support at $0.24 and resistance near $0.53, with secondary markers at $0.09 and $0.68. Bears dominate, as technical signals lean bearish, with no clear uptrend in sight. Trading strategies focus on cautious long entries near support, emphasizing mindful risk management in case of a breakout. Conclusion HBAR , VET , and ENA are currently at crucial support levels. These levels are important as they could influence price moves in the mid-term. Monitoring these points may offer insights into potential buying or selling opportunities. If these support levels hold, more positive price action might follow. Failing to hold could lead to further declines.

While Bitcoin (BTC) , Ethereum (ETH) , and XRP are picking up traction across all major exchanges, the market is also shifting its attention to early-stage plays with real breakout potential. One name that keeps dominating watchlists? MAGACOINFINANCE . MAGACOINFINANCE Is the Top Altcoin to Buy Before It Lists MAGACOINFINANCE is dominating early-stage crypto conversations with unmatched momentum, a capped supply of just 100 billion tokens , and explosive community support. Backed by a clear 25x ROI structure and the active MAGA50X bonus , it’s being called the best altcoin to buy before listings go live . This is the one project smart investors aren’t ignoring. FINAL CALL — ACT NOW & SECURE YOUR SPOT! XRP XRP has returned to form, gaining steam after positive regulatory developments. While it may deliver a 3x–4x in the long run, the climb is steady—not explosive. In contrast, MAGACOINFINANCE is engineered for speed , giving investors a real shot at outsized returns far quicker than traditional altcoins. Ethereum Ethereum (ETH) continues to lead in smart contract innovation and institutional adoption. However, its size limits ROI potential. Investors looking for rapid gains are now reallocating small-cap entries into MAGACOINFINANCE , which offers the kind of movement ETH once delivered in its earliest years. JOIN 12,500+ NOW — LIMITED TIME Bitcoin Bitcoin (BTC) holds its role as the market anchor, and rightly so. But its high entry point and slow returns make it ideal for preservation—not rapid growth. MAGACOINFINANCE, on the other hand, is trending in early-stage groups for its aggressive structure and built-in momentum , drawing eyes away from slow movers. Toncoin Toncoin (TON) is carving out a space in the social and messaging sector, but remains limited in broader adoption. Investors are noticing that MAGACOINFINANCE has better timing and more aggressive community engagement , leading to stronger FOMO and faster wallet growth. LINK Chainlink (LINK) has utility and trust, especially in oracle services. Yet it lacks excitement in the short term. MAGACOINFINANCE fills that void , bringing early-stage energy and ROI buzz that LINK simply no longer commands. 50% EXTRA BONUS LIVE — USE CODE MAGA50X BEFORE IT’S GONE! HBAR Hedera (HBAR) is quietly expanding through enterprise integrations, but lacks investor excitement. MAGACOINFINANCE, by contrast, is making noise —influencers, analysts, and Telegram communities are all aligned on its breakout potential this quarter. Conclusion BTC, ETH, and XRP are solid choices—but their growth is now measured. For investors seeking explosive ROI with real positioning before a listing , MAGACOINFINANCE offers what the majors no longer can . It’s trending, it’s accelerating, and it’s turning small entries into big plays.

But let’s be honest—many projects just couldn’t deliver. Some fizzled out in hype cycles. Others got stuck in scaling nightmares or failed integrations. Qubetics , Gala, and Immutable X are emerging as that rare class of next big crypto contenders. They’re not battling for likes—they’re solving concrete challenges. From enterprise-ready infrastructure to decentralized content ecosystems and NFT-powered gaming, these platforms are being discussed in developer circles for what they do, not what they might do. And among them, Qubetics is pulling focus like a magnet. What makes Qubetics ($TICS) stand out is its practical attack on problems that previous blockchains glossed over. While others obsessed over speed and speculation, Qubetics built a real-world toolkit, starting with its Decentralized VPN that can genuinely change how digital privacy, secure access, and cross-border operations work. And it’s not just gaining attention—it’s becoming the go-to solution for users who want more than promises and hype, demanding tools that actually deliver in real-world scenarios. Qubetics – Building Trust Through Decentralized Privacy Qubetics is engineered for those who demand real-world value from blockchain. Its flagship? A Decentralized VPN built to empower seamless, borderless, and censorship-resistant online access for enterprises, creators, and platforms that need airtight data protection. Picture this: A supply chain platform securely communicating with global partners without third-party surveillance. Or a DeFi protocol team working remotely across continents—sharing data, accessing private testnets, and safeguarding proprietary contracts using Qubetics’ VPN. Even cross-chain applications benefit by running privacy-sensitive nodes without leaving their security to chance. This isn’t wishful thinking—it’s already happening. Now let’s talk numbers. Qubetics is currently in Stage 30 of its crypto presale, priced at $0.1729 per $TICS token. More than 24,900 community members have already joined the movement. With over 508 million tokens sold and $16.2 million raised, Qubetics isn’t a future player—it’s already shaping the next wave. And projections? At $1, early participants could see a 478% ROI. At $15, that figure skyrockets to 8,568% ROI. That’s not speculation—that’s momentum you can quantify. What Happens If You Put $200 into Qubetics Right Now? With $200, you’d lock in 1,157 $TICS tokens at the current stage. Should $TICS hit $5, you’re staring at $5,785, and if it touches the $15 mark, you’re pocketing a mind-blowing $17,355. That’s wealth acceleration that legacy banks can’t offer. The early entries are winning already—don’t miss the train before it leaves the station, the next big crypto, and the best crypto presale for 2025. Gala – Rebuilding on Utility After the Dip Gala Games built its brand around decentralizing entertainment, especially in gaming and music. But the price rollercoaster hasn’t been gentle. From its high of $0.067 in 2024 to a current $0.01396 (as of April 18, 2025), Gala’s journey has tested the faith of its earliest supporters. But if technical indicators have any say, the tide may be turning. A falling wedge pattern is forming—a classic reversal sign. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) and RSI both suggest accumulation is underway. These aren’t memes—they’re momentum. And Gala’s pivot to a stable pricing mechanism for in-game stores (tied to a 3-day moving average) shows maturity. By insulating players and developers from extreme volatility, Gala is rebuilding trust one block at a time. The Gala Games ecosystem is also staying creative. While broader metaverse talk has cooled, Gala’s commitment to gaming-first utility means titles like GRIT and Spider Tanks continue drawing developer attention. This isn’t about speculation—it’s about experience. And that means Gala’s infrastructure and IP licensing could offer long-term appeal. Despite price drops, Gala’s ability to pivot and re-center on utility shows it’s still one of the next big crypto projects worth tracking. Immutable X – Powering NFTs Without the Gas Pain Immutable X isn’t just scaling Ethereum—it’s rewriting what NFTs can be. Powered by zk-rollups, it delivers gas-free minting, near-instant trades, and zero security trade-offs. For developers, that means frictionless deployment. For users, it means NFTs that don’t come with surprise charges or delayed confirmations. With a focus on gaming, Immutable X supports heavyweights like Gods Unchained, where item ownership isn’t just cosmetic—it’s integrated, transferable, and valuable. This L2 solution tackles Ethereum’s biggest headaches—scaling and cost—while keeping its security intact. No bridges, no compromises. IMX trades at $0.54. A short-term dip of 3.11% has some watching cautiously, but long-term metrics are solid. Partnerships with OpenSea, Mintable, and StarkWare have deepened its moat, and a broader shift toward utility NFTs in the metaverse plays directly to its strengths. Immutable X doesn’t just follow trends—it enables them. It’s a next big crypto for those who see NFTs as more than art—they’re infrastructure. Why These Three Are On Everyone’s Radar Qubetics, Gala, and Immutable X weren’t chosen for hype. Each one represents a different evolution in blockchain utility—whether it’s privacy-first infrastructure, decentralized gaming ecosystems, or NFT-powered ownership with zero gas costs. Qubetics leads with real-life use cases, like cross-border privacy and multi-chain deployment. Gala keeps betting on community engagement and developer loyalty through stable pricing and immersive entertainment. Immutable X is changing how Ethereum’s scalability problem is solved in the NFT realm. Together, they’re building an internet not just owned by users—but run on tools that work in the real world. Next big crypto is more than a phrase—it’s a call to action. Don’t sit idle watching others take the lead. This trio is gaining traction, and early participation often separates those who watch from those who win. Conclusion: The Blueprint for What’s Coming Next The crypto winter didn’t wipe out potential—it filtered out the noise. What’s left now are projects with staying power. Projects with actual working products, engaged communities, and real-world purpose. Qubetics is redefining digital privacy with a Decentralized VPN that isn’t theoretical—it’s operational. Gala is quietly correcting its trajectory with pricing innovations and real engagement strategies. Immutable X is already hosting some of the most innovative gaming and NFT projects in the space. When the next wave hits, these names will be riding high. Don’t just scroll past. Act, explore, and research further. The next big crypto wave is already forming—and it’s got utility at its core. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What makes Qubetics different from other new crypto projects? Qubetics combines interoperability with real-world solutions, like a decentralized VPN, making it a standout for utility-driven blockchain applications. Is Gala still a good project after its recent price drop? Yes, Gala Games has introduced stable pricing and technical indicators show a potential bullish reversal, indicating continued relevance in decentralized entertainment. Why is Immutable X considered a strong Layer 2 solution for NFTs? Its zk-rollup tech enables gas-free NFT transactions while preserving Ethereum’s security, making it ideal for developers and users in gaming and metaverse projects.

The latest wave of optimism was set in motion when Real Vision co‑founder Raoul Pal published an updated overlay of Bitcoin versus Global M2—an aggregate of every major country’s broad money supply converted to US‑dollar terms—and told followers, “It is time, give or take a few days.” Other accounts also shared similar charts. One asserted that Bitcoin “continues to mirror Global M2 with its classic 12‑week lag,” predicting “aggressive upside likely kicks off next week… $74.5 K looks like it was the bottom,” while other self-proclaimed crypto guru promised a new all‑time high “within weeks.” Bitcoin Vs. M2: Is A Price Explosion Really Coming? The viral charts drew immediate fire from TXMC (@TXMCtrades). In a lengthy thread he argued that computing a daily or even weekly Global M2 series is “goofy and frankly a scam” because “the United States is only updating M2 on a weekly basis and all others are monthly.” He continued: Related Reading: This Bitcoin Bear Confirmation Is Yet To Appear, Glassnode Reveals “You are looking at basically 30 out of 31 days of FX fluctuations with a static once‑monthly global aggregate multiplied behind it… China, USA, and Japan have even updated into March. The rest are still on February values during a time when the dollar has been tanking hard… You’re looking at an M2‑weighted inverse dollar exchange rate 95% of the time. Be better at math!” TXMC noted that China now accounts for roughly 46 percent of the putative Global M2 and is “the ONLY major country whose broad money supply is above its post‑covid peak in dollar terms,” a dynamic that “goes straight up” because Beijing is “trying to ease out of an ongoing multi‑year debt deflation.” By contrast, US M2 “is below its 2022 peak… and growing at the slowest pace since Bitcoin’s birth excluding 2022‑24 when it was negative y/y.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces Pressure As Report Flags Chinese Sell-Off Plans Beyond the cadence mismatch, he blasted the practice of applying “random #‑week offsets” to force a visual correlation between Global M2 and Bitcoin. “These charts are over‑fitted junk using extremely recent history as a thesis for why they should correlate,” he said, adding that while assets can be “directionally sympathetic on a monthly basis… the main critiques relate to presenting a daily/weekly metric using monthly data… AND using over‑fitted offsets of that data to try to forecast the future for a content audience.” The broadside prompted a rebuttal from YouTuber Colin Talks Crypto (@ColinTCrypto), who claimed that key central banks do in fact provide higher‑frequency figures. “China M2 updates daily—not monthly,” he wrote, attaching what he said were current charts through April 17 2025. “Japan’s M2 also updates daily… Since about half of your post relies on ‘China data being slow and outdated’… your post’s main argument weakens greatly at this point.” TXMC swiftly countered that assertion, insisting “there is no daily M2” and that any high‑frequency series is merely “a projection of a 1‑2 month old value using real‑time FX values.” The sudden April “pop” in Global M2, he maintained, is nothing more than the dollar’s sharp slide translated mechanically into larger dollar‑denominated money stocks. “Because Global M2 doesn’t actually exist, it is an abstraction of money that lives solely in a chart formula,” he wrote. “It treats all broad aggregates around the world as the same pool of eligible capital and introduces a heap of noise via foreign exchange rates… this is how the sausage is actually made and it’s not sexy.” At press time, BTC traded at $84,750.

His recent media appearances show a turn toward Republican support as part of his public strategy. He drafted personal notes outlining a public relations plan to reshape his image via conservative media channels. Convicted for orchestrating a vast fraud at a major cryptocurrency exchange, he faces a lengthy prison term and hefty restitution orders. On April 18, disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman‑Fried was transferred to the low‑security Federal Correctional Institution Terminal Island in Los Angeles—renowned for once housing Al Capone and Charles Manson—after a brief stay at a medium‑security facility in San Bernardino County. Sam Bankman‑Fried Moved to Los Angeles Prison According to data from the Federal Bureau of Prisons , Bankman-Fried is currently housed at Terminal Island Federal Correctional Facility (FCI), which previously held cult leader Charles Manson, crime boss Al Capone and former Theranos COO Ramesh Balwani. Bankman‑Fried was previously held at FCI Victorville , a prison in San Bernardino County that is known for being “violent” and “political.” Just last month, Bankman-Fried was held at the Federal Transfer Facility in Oklahoma City, OK, before ultimately being transported to his home state of California. Bankman-Fried’s shifting journey through federal prisons comes shortly after the one-time “king of crypto” gave a high‑profile interview behind bars to media personality Tucker Carlson. Going according to Sam's plan – ""Go on Tucker Carlson, come out as a republican"" pic.twitter.com/T5Zueo2QML — Coffeezilla (@coffeebreak_YT) March 7, 2025 SBF had previously drafted a Google Doc listing potential ways he could improve his public image after FTX’s collapse, including going on the misspelled “Tucker Carlsen” show and coming out as a Republican “against the woke agenda.” Some legal commentators contend that Bankman‑Fried’s recent right‑leaning messaging could be an attempt to position himself for a potential pardon from President Donald Trump. Bankman-Fried Behind Bars With $11B Restitution Order Bankman-Fried was convicted on multiple fraud charges in November 2023 for the dramatic crash of FTX after a month-long trial that saw numerous associates of the former crypto kingpin testify against him. “He knew it was wrong,” Judge Lewis A. Kaplan said during Bankman-Fried’s sentencing in March 2024. “He knew it was criminal. He regrets making a bad bet against the likelihood of getting caught—he’s not going to admit a thing.” SBF is currently serving a 25-year sentence and has been ordered to repay $11 billion for orchestrating the massive crypto scheme .

Since a 69,000‑tonne tanker from Corpus Christi, Texas, reached the south‑eastern province of Fujian on 6 February, no other U.S. LNG vessel has docked in China. A second ship bound for the mainland changed course to Bangladesh after failing to arrive before Beijing’s 15% tariff on American LNG took effect on 10 February. That duty has since risen to 49%, making the fuel uneconomical for Chinese buyers for the foreseeable future. The halt repeats a year‑long block on U.S. LNG during Donald Trump’s first term. Analysts say the latest stand‑off could have wider consequences, drawing China closer to Russian supplies and clouding the prospects of the multibillion‑dollar export terminals now being built in the United States and Mexico. “There will be long‑term consequences,” said Anne‑Sophie Corbeau, a natural‑gas specialist at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. “I do not think Chinese LNG importers will ever contract any new U.S. LNG.” China already takes only a small share of its LNG from the United States. After Russia’s full‑scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Chinese firms found it more profitable to resell U.S. cargoes to Europe. Last year, just 6% of China’s LNG imports came from American plants, down from 11% in 2021. Even so, Chinese groups, including PetroChina and Sinopec, hold 13 long‑term contracts for U.S. LNG running as far as 2049. Those off‑take agreements were crucial to financing new Gulf Coast projects, but developers have recently tried to renegotiate terms to reflect higher inflation and the burden of Chinese tariffs. Beijing is meanwhile turning to Moscow In the short term, few expect trade to resume. “The last time this happened, there was a complete hiatus until the Chinese authorities granted waivers to companies, but that was at a time when gas demand was booming,” said Gillian Boccara, an analyst at Kpler. “Now we are looking at lower economic growth, and we think the Chinese can withstand the loss of these cargoes for quite a long time.” China’s ambassador to Russia, Zhang Hanhui, said this week that Chinese buyers were eager to raise purchases of Russian LNG. “So many buyers are asking the embassy to help establish contacts with Russian suppliers, I think there will definitely be more [imports],” Zhang told reporters. Russia is already China’s third‑largest LNG supplier, behind Australia and Qatar, and the two governments are negotiating a second cross‑border gas pipeline, Power of Siberia 2. “With tariffs rising to the level where they are an effective embargo, we will see a reshuffling of trade flows,” said Richard Bronze of consultancy Energy Aspects. “We also expect Asia demand to fall by five to ten million tonnes as a whole. That should bring gas prices down a bit in Europe.” For now, the empty arrival logs at Chinese ports underline the practical impact of tariffs that turned U.S. LNG from a growth trade into a stranded cargo, while giving Russia another opening in Asia’s largest gas market.

TRUMP was last trading around $7.70, close to its lowest levels since its launch back in January. The Trump organization launched the official TRUMP coin just ahead of Trump’s inauguration in late January. Initial hype say the meme coin surge to a price of over $70 and a market cap in the $10s of billions. However, the meme coin has since reversed close to 90% lower. That’s partly because the TRUMP coin launch sucked a lot of liquidity out of the broader meme coin market, which has been in sharp decline since the token’s launch. It’s also because the macro backdrop has taken a substantial turn for the worse , with risk assets like stocks and crypto taking a beating from concerns about the economic fallout from Trump’s trade wars. But TRUMP coin’s price has also likely suffered from an intense amount of criticism, and concerns about potentially unfair tokenomics. Its sharp decline back from post-launch highs looks typical of a “pump-and-dump” scheme, a common type of scam in crypto, with many calling it out as such. Trump’s meme coin has to be the biggest scam of the season. pic.twitter.com/nCvNWgyVP1 — VolgaLad (@cym27s) April 13, 2025 Meanwhile, there are concerns that the tokenomic distribution of the meme coin is unfair, with the Trump organization having gifted themselves 80% of the token’s overall supply. These tokens have been vested to release over the next three years, with 4% of supply, worth around $300 million, unlocking on Friday. Despite having $300m in unlocks today and then unlocks every day after that the $TRUMP token is up on the day. pic.twitter.com/3qDI4qLREU — Chris (@ChrisCoffeeEth) April 18, 2025 Where Next for TRUMP Coin? Here’s What the Chart Says Fundamentals paint a difficult picture for TRUMP coin right now. In the absence of a major improvement in sentiment for the broader crypto market, the meme coin is unlikely to be going anywhere fast. Chart analysis also paints a bearish picture for TRUMP coin. TRUMP has continually found resistance at its 21DMA in recent months, and appears to be stuck in a downwards trend channel. If the current trend continues, TRUMP could fall to around $5 by the end of the month. A substantial rebound is likely overdue at this point, though, and if the meme coin were to break above its recent downtrend and 21DMA, a quick rally back above $10 would be likely. Still, as macroeconomic uncertainty remains high, any TRUMP rally is likely to remain short-lived and shallow. Savvy investors will be using the current high levels of uncertainty in the market, and suppressed crypto prices right now, as an opportunity to accumulate. However, concerns about the credibility of the TRUMP meme coin suggest it may not be the best crypto to buy now. Coins like Bitcoin , Ethereum and Solana are likely to see big gains before the end of Trump’s four-year term, and are much safer bets than TRUMP coin. That said, this is crypto, and Trump is the biggest name in the world. TRUMP coin could surprise everyone with a major comeback at any moment. Just as its fallen 90% from recent highs, a 10x rally to new record highs is also possible.

Ali Yahya, a general partner at a16z crypto, announced the investment in ZRO , the native token of the omnichain interoperability protocol LayerZero. LayerZero aims to move data across blockchains and support “censorship-resistant messages and permissionless development through immutable smart contracts.” Yahya notes the a16z investment has a three-year lockup. ZRO was trading around $2.33 prior to the announcement and surged to a high of $2.54 around 90 minutes later. The 208th-ranked crypto asset by market cap has since partially retraced to $2.46 at time of writing, though it remains up by more than 2.5% in the past 24 hours. The overall crypto market cap, by comparison, is down more than 1% in the past day. Earlier this week, the on-chain perpetual exchange GMX announced LayerZero would serve as the “preferred messaging infrastructure provider” for its multichain expansion. The XDC Network, a layer-1 blockchain, also recently announced a LayerZero omnichain integration. Explains XDC, “This integration connects the XDC Network to over 125+ LayerZero-supported blockchains, empowering developers and enterprises to build omnichain applications interacting across networks with enhanced trust, speed, and efficiency.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

SOL Technical Analysis reveals the price testing support, yet resistance near $120 still limits any major breakout. On the other hand, Dogecoin Price Today shows a drop to $0.1458, marking a 3% decrease. However, key indicators and increased whale activity indicate the move could be temporary. While charts keep traders busy, another segment is focusing elsewhere. BlockDAG (BDAG) continues gaining traction, not only for price performance but also for standout initiatives. Its upcoming Web3 learning program, the BlockDAG Academy, has sparked real interest among developers. With $215 million already secured and early backers seeing 2,380% returns, BDAG is becoming known as one of the best-performing cryptos in current circulation. SOL Technical Analysis: Resistance Holds as Price Struggles Recent data from SOL Technical Analysis shows a doji candlestick forming around the $94.83 level, hinting at a possible short-term rebound. The climb toward $111.78 came shortly after Janover made public their interest in acquiring SOL, reigniting curiosity in the asset. Still, the coin has found it tough to push through the $120 barrier, currently trading at $106.74. Analysts continue to debate whether this signals a solid reversal or just a classic fake-out rally. Adding to the outlook, Solana’s network strength stands out. DEX volumes topped $2.9 billion over the past month, and decentralized platforms like Orca and Pump are showing strong usage. If SOL fails to overcome resistance, the $80 support range may come into play next. Dogecoin Price Today: Market Pullback Triggers a Dip As of now, Dogecoin Price Today is pegged at $0.1458, falling 3% over the past day after a broader crypto correction tied to new U.S. tariff updates. Despite this decline, several technical signals still point toward active market engagement. Support levels remain intact below the $0.15 range, and both whale and mid-tier holdings are on the rise. Wallet addresses holding 10,000 DOGE or more have climbed to 240,000, up from 236,000 in just a short span. Though price sentiment looks uncertain, the MACD suggests a bullish crossover might be approaching. An upward trendline continues to provide backing, though the Directional Movement Index (DMI) hints at ongoing market indecision. BlockDAG Web3 Academy Prepares for Launch to Support Web3 Growth The spotlight on BlockDAG (BDAG) is brighter than ever, with its $215 million presale success and now the introduction of the Web3-focused BlockDAG Academy. Currently, BDAG is trading at $0.0248 in its 27th batch, having sold 19.2 billion coins since the presale began. Those who joined early have already seen a 2,380% return. Presented by blockchain expert Maurice Herlihy during Keynote 3 , the Academy is structured into three tiers: Elementary for starters, Intermediate for learning about smart contracts and decentralized governance, and Advanced for developers diving into APIs and dApp development. This initiative isn’t just another course; it’s a clear learning path meant for everyday users and advanced coders alike. With simplified material and practical modules, it aims to help users move from theory to hands-on implementation. As Herlihy put it, the Academy teaches more than basic navigation—it provides the reasoning behind the actions. With many searching for genuine learning opportunities in Web3, BlockDAG stands out by offering clarity and structure. The Academy is set to be the starting point for those aiming to gain real knowledge and apply it directly within the BlockDAG ecosystem. Final Words! SOL Technical Analysis continues to show strong network performance, but price progress is still limited by overhead resistance. Dogecoin Price Today reflects a minor pullback, yet accumulation patterns suggest an underlying strength. Neither asset has made a decisive move. Meanwhile, BlockDAG keeps growing in momentum. With a $215 million presale, over 2,380% in early returns, and a live rate of $0.0248, it remains one of the best-performing cryptos right now. The introduction of BlockDAG Academy is another bold step, capturing developer attention and making a strong case for BDAG’s continued rise in Web3.

After all, there were expectations that Cardano’s token would be included in a crypto strategic reserve. Hoskinson has shrugged off the snub, not seeing why it should bother him when he is not trying to enter their good books. Charles Hoskinson did not mind not getting invited to the crypto summit One of the biggest reasons why Hoskinson does not feel left out after not getting an invitation to the summit is that he is not going out of his way to foster a connection to the Trump administration. ”A lot of people want to get close to David Sacks and Bo Hines and build relationships there,” Hoskinson told DL News. “That’s the flavor of the week. It’s nice for optics, but it doesn’t translate into sustainable, permanent policy.” As far as the billionaire blockchain builder is concerned, he does not need to “make a deal with Trump,” and so spending time with him is not at the top of his list of priorities. These days, he has his hands filled with promoting blockchain technology — ie, Cardano — to lawmakers, regulators, and even the occasional head of state as a useful tool for government services. In a bid to win these people over, Hoskinson has become some sort of DeFi diplomat flying around the world to offer insight on forming what he calls sustainable, permanent policy for blockchain technology. He has even reportedly gotten close to Senator Tim Scott, the influential chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, who is shepherding the landmark stablecoin bill through Congress. Great dinner with Senator Scott. America's best days are coming pic.twitter.com/r8tXfzhDB9 — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) November 21, 2024 Hoskinson hopes the future of crypto will have stable regulatory laws Since Trump became president, he has signed an executive order to overhaul crypto policy, established a Bitcoin strategic reserve, and appointed Paul Atkins , a pro-crypto lawyer, to head the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It has taken the industry several steps forward but, Hoskinson is looking at the long game and hopes that when Trump’s time comes to an end, the changes he made will remain permanent fixtures in the emerging framework for the industry. He has been advocating for more stable regulatory laws and is currently monitoring a market structure bill that would establish clear regulatory authority by dividing up the responsibilities between the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ). Solidifying such measures into place is important, Hoskinson has said. “There will be a person after Trump, whether it be JD Vance or a Democrat or somebody else, it’s immaterial,” he stated. “I need a consistent, stable set of rules.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

On Friday, the firm filed an S-1 prospectus with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for a spot Tron ETF that would include staking capabilities. The new Canary Staked TRX ETF product seeks to provide Tron’s price exposure . Canary Capital expands ETF lineup with Tron filing Renowned for pioneering some of the most notable altcoin ETF products, this latest Tron ETF further solidifies the firm’s position at the forefront of the exchange-traded fund revolution. Canary Capital has yet to reveal the trading platform on which the product will trade; however, it confirms it will provide exposure to the price of Tron. Canary Capital plans to use Coindesk Indices’ pricing data to determine the product’s Net Asset Value (NAV). This latest filing comes barely a month after the asset manager filed for Pengu ETF with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Nashville, Tennessee-based Canary is also seeking approval for Sui and XRP ETFs, in addition to filings for Hedera (HBAR) and Polkadot (DOT), bringing its total number of altcoin ETF proposals to six. The spike in applications is part of a flurry of filings for ETFs tracking altcoins, resulting from last year’s successful debut of funds tracking Bitcoin and Ethereum’s performance, respectively. The 11 Bitcoin funds have gained over $35 billion in net inflows over 15 months. As the trust’s sponsor, Canary Capital Group LLC will oversee the ETF’s operations and manage its performance . CSC Delaware Trust Company is expected to act as the trustee. The company notes that this new product structure intends to offer investors regulated access to staking rewards and market exposure to one of the most popular proof-of-stake digital assets. Tron, trading as TRX and the ninth-biggest cryptocurrency with a $23 billion market capitalization, was trading at about $0.24, down more than 3% over the past 24 hours. TRX has risen roughly 120% during the past year. The coin runs on its own blockchain and aims to build a decentralized internet controlled and owned by the individuals who use it. New SEC leadership hopes for altcoin ETF approvals by mid-2025 Industry optimism remains high despite the SEC’s ongoing delays in ruling on several altcoin ETF proposals. Other asset managers, including BlackRock, Bitwise, 21Shares, Franklin Templeton, and VanEck, are on the list of major fund issuers seeking an SEC green light for proposed ETFs. The companies have now filed applications for ETFs based on Solana (SOL), XRP, Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Litecoin (LTC). Industry analysts have said that XRP and Solana ETFs will likely receive approval next. Earlier this year, Bloomberg analysts forecasted a 90% chance of a Litecoin ETF gaining approval in 2025, citing its classification as a commodity and its structural resemblance to Bitcoin. The recent appointment of Paul Atkins as the new SEC Chair is also expected to boost the prospects for crypto ETF approvals. Alongside commissioners Mark Uyeda and Hester Peirce—both industry-friendly—Atkins is viewed as a positive force for the sector. With the change in leadership, experts anticipate that the SEC could greenlight multiple altcoin ETFs by mid-2025. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

ADA broke above a short-term downtrend around one week ago and if it can also break above its 21DMA, a bounce to its 200DMA in the $0.70s is likely. However, in the grand scheme of things, ADA remains stuck well within its recent multi-month $0.50-$1.20ish range. And the outlook for a major breakout above this range isn’t looking great right now. That’s principally because 1) risk appetite in the broader market remains poor and 2) a flood of new liquidity is unlikely to materialize anytime soon. Whilst ardently pro-crypto, the Trump administration is intent on pursuing economic policies (namely tariffs) that are likely to harm the US economy in the short-term, whilst also pushing up inflation. The prospect of weaker growth is hurting risk assets like stocks and crypto. The fact that Fed policymakers, namely the Fed chair Jerome Powell , are reluctant to cut interest rates due to fears about sticky inflation are making things worse. Jerome Powell could lower rates and boost the economy but refuses Is it time to end the FED? pic.twitter.com/iRKTkWk8mZ — TaraBull (@TaraBull808) April 18, 2025 Altcoin seasons that have benefitted the Cardano price in the past have typically come at times of mass liquidity injection from the Fed. But a new flood of liquidity is unlikely to come anytime soon, so major altcoins like Cardano are set to continue to struggle. What Needs to Happen for a 400% Cardano Price Rally? If the US economy tilts into recession later this year and the Fed doesn’t respond as aggressively as the market hopes, that could be a recipe for substantially lower crypto price in the coming months. The Cardano price could easily slip back to test its mid-2024 levels around $0.30. For a major rally to send the price surging back towards record highs above $3.0 per token, a few things will need to happen. Firstly, the economy will likely need to be coming through the other end of any recession. That would allow risk appetite in the broader market to pick up. But for altcoin season to really get going, major easing from the Fed would be required. If the Fed is pumping the market full of QE again, this would be the signal for the potential arrival of a new altcoin season. Under such circumstances, a 400% rally back to record highs for ADA would be very possible. In fact, Cardano could even go further than that before the end of Trump’s four-year term. The Trump administration and current Congress are massively pro-crypto, with both pushing regulatory policies/legislation designed to bolster growth in the industry. “Cardano is a ghost chain with nothing going for it” Cardano: pic.twitter.com/88KDoqM5mB — Dawson Allen (@ddawsoncrypto) September 26, 2024 That should lift all boats, including the Cardano price. That said, Cardano lack’s substantial adoption compared to some of its closest rivals like Solana and Ethereum . Cardano Alternative to Consider – Solaxy (SOLX) Given its high level of adoption and developer activity, Solana is likely to extend its lead over Cardano in the coming years. That’s probably going to be reflected in better SOL price performance, too when compared to ADA. Those confident in Solana’s outlook would do well to accumulate SOL during the current market dip. However, it might also be a good idea for Solana investors to add highly promising Solana projects like Solaxy (SOLX) to their portfolios as well, given the prospect of even higher gains. Solaxy (SOLX), a pioneering Layer-2 solution for the Solana blockchain, addresses critical network congestion and scalability issues, enhancing transaction speed and reliability. By processing transactions off-chain and settling on Solana’s mainnet, Solaxy ensures low fees and high throughput, supporting applications like meme coin trading.

Factors such as increased adoption, community support, and favorable market conditions contribute to this optimistic outlook. Phase 4 of the MUTM presale is now live, sparking optimism among investors. With over $6.9 million raised and 8400 holders already on board, new investors are snapping up MUTM tokens at the current price of $0.025, knowing that the price will rise to $0.03 in Phase 5. Current participants have the potential to earn a 140% return on investment before the official project launch at $0.06. While DOGE aims for a substantial price increase, MUTM’s innovative approach and early-stage momentum suggest it could offer even more significant returns for investors seeking high-growth opportunities. Mutuum Finance Presale Surges as Investor Interest Grows Mutuum Finance has emerged as one of the rapidly rising top decentralized lending platforms thanks to its distinctive dual lending structure which attracts extensive investor interest. The project’s presale has attracted more than 8,400 investors who contributed $6.9 million to its success scale. During Phase 4 MUTM tokens offer a price of $0.025 yet investors can anticipate 20% profit growth from Phase 5’s price increase. Multiple analysts assure that MUTM represents a DeFi platform of low value because it will reach over $5 in market capitalization upon launching. MUTM provides investors with stable investment opportunities unlike the volatile nature of meme coins. Investors seeking returns from DeFi operations will find MUTM attractive due to its distinctive lending mechanisms along with a dynamic top-50 leader leaderboard system that provides benefits to loyal users. DeFi Experiences a Game-Changing Shift Mutuum Finance creates an innovative DeFi platform that combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models into one unified system. Users can generate passive earnings through the P2C model by providing USDT liquidity with automatic functionality supported by smart contracts. Users have the ability to make direct transactions through the P2P model which eliminates the requirement for intermediaries. Mutuum Finance integrates its P2C and P2P systems to create an attractive decentralized finance solution which enhances user security and operational efficiency and decentralization for investors searching for profits in the DeFi sector. Creating Stability and Security in DeFi Mutuum Finance provides a USD-backed stablecoin operated on Ethereum as a long-term asset solution. Through the implementation of over-collateralization the platform maintains lower risks than conventional algorithmic stablecoins do. Open-source smart contracts coupled with regular audits alongside this method establishes investor trust by preventing the security weaknesses detected in former DeFi projects. Mutuum Finance implements the $100,000 giveaway to support growth through which ten lucky winners receive $10,000 in MUTM tokens. Users who refer new investors to the ecosystem through the platform earn rewarding benefits from the built-in referral system. The first participants to join Mutuum Finance gain special access to staking opportunities as well as governance powers along with priority updates which keeps them deeply involved in the project’s advancement. Sustainable Tokenomics for Future Growth Mutuum Finance’s tokenomics strategy integrates limited token supply and deflationary elements to create scarcity, driving future value appreciation. By offering staking rewards, the platform incentivizes users to lock in their tokens, which helps support the token’s value as the project progresses. This approach ensures long-term growth and stability for both the platform and its investors, making MUTM a strong performer in the DeFi market. Dogecoin (DOGE) could hit $1 in 2025, but experts say the real moonshot might be Ethereum-based Mutuum Finance (MUTM), currently in Phase 4 of its presale at $0.025. With over $6.9 million raised, 8,400+ investors onboard, and a projected launch price of $0.06, early buyers could lock in a 140% return pre-launch and possibly up to 15,880% if price targets of $5+ are hit post-launch. Don’t wait, join the presale now to secure your position before Phase 5 kicks in and prices rise.

The premier cryptocurrency appears primed for positive movement in 2025, despite lingering macroeconomic uncertainty. Bitcoin Looks Ready To Reverse Trend In a Quicktake post, CryptoQuant contributor Crypto Dan highlighted that BTC is currently undergoing a correction phase similar to the one observed in 2024. The analyst noted that the amount of BTC held for less than one week to one month can serve as an indicator of how “overheated” the crypto market is. Related Reading: Bitcoin Following Gold’s Footsteps? Analyst Sets Mid-Term Target At $155,000 For context, in markets with high speculative activity – such as crypto – price pullbacks tend to be significant. In contrast, markets with lower speculation, like gold, typically experience shallower corrections. Crypto Dan shared the following chart showing three major phases of the crypto market – a market rally (red arrow), an increase in the ratio of BTC held for less than one week to one month (green pattern), and a subsequent correction (yellow arrow). He explained that this pattern has played out twice during the current bull market, with both instances showing similarly elevated levels of short-term BTC holdings, suggesting a comparable degree of market overheating. This ratio has now reached a cycle low, highlighted in the yellow-box region of the chart. Notably, this same region also marked the bottom of the 2024 market cycle. If the pattern mirrors its behaviour from 2024, it could indicate that the current cycle has also bottomed out. Crypto Dan explained: In other words, the overheating is now resolved, and although we may need to wait a little longer, with the progress of macroeconomic issues, 2025 is likely to show a positive movement. Adding to the optimism, a separate post on X by crypto analyst Titan of Crypto also points to a possible shift in momentum. The analyst noted that BTC recently formed a golden cross on the daily chart – a bullish signal that often suggests a trend reversal is underway. For the uninitiated, a golden cross occurs when Bitcoin’s 50-day moving average crosses above its 200-day moving average, signalling a potential long-term bullish trend. It’s widely seen as a buy signal by traders, indicating growing upward momentum. BTC Futures Sentiment Index Signals Caution Despite these bullish signals, not all analysts are convinced. Fellow CryptoQuant contributor abramchart recently observed that BTC’s futures sentiment index has continued to decline since February, suggesting a more cautious outlook among derivatives traders.

Adding to the leading digital asset’s woes, a recent report suggested that China may be preparing to sell a large amount of confiscated BTC, which may increase selling pressure and potentially suppress prices in the short term. At press time, BTC trades at $84,766, down 0.1% in the past 24 hours.

A leading crypto analyst has identified multiple bullish catalysts that could drive ADA’s momentum and help propel the cryptocurrency to this bullish target. Institutional Interest To Fuel Cardano Price Recovery According to a recent technical analysis by a pseudonymous TradingView analyst, ‘Risk_Adj_Return,’ the Cardano price is suddenly showing signs of recovery after a period of sluggish performance. This seemingly bullish turnaround has sparked predictions of a potential surge to $1.7. Related Reading: Cardano Price Prediction: ADA Set To Crash To $0.4 After Correction To Liquidity Zone According to the analyst’s report, several factors have been fueling ADA’s recovery. Despite its downtrend, large spot purchases have been observed, hinting at growing interest from institutional investors. The analyst also mentioned that political developments from key figures, such as US President Donald Trump, could spark further bullish sentiment for Cardano. Although many of the present institutional buy-ins for Cardano have been followed by sell-offs, possibly from short-term traders, the sheer volume suggests that major players are closely watching the market. Part of this renewed institutional interest is attributed to the US Federal Reserve (FED) and broader macroeconomic signals. Investors may be hoping for a shift in monetary policy or clear signs of easing inflation in the upcoming FOMC meeting, as this could boost risk assets like ADA. Any alignment between the Cardano price action and the FED decision could become a significant catalyst for upside momentum. In his Cardano price chart, the TradingView analyst highlighted a bullish long trade setup on the 4-hour timeframe, utilizing the Heikin-Ashi candles. The trading strategy is supported by multiple take-profit levels, with the entry point marked near Cardano’s current price range. A clear stop loss has also been placed just below the local support to manage downside risks. The trade plan involves three key take-profit levels: $0.73, $0.96, and $1.21. These targets align with previous resistance zones, allowing traders to potentially lock in gains before ADA reaches its ultimate upside target of $1.74. ADA Breakout Unlikely Amid US Trade Tensions The Cardano price is showing signs of strength, according to a market expert, ‘AMCrypto’, who notes that it is holding firm at a critical ascending support trendline on the 4-hour chart. After a recent decline, ADA bounced off the trendline, maintaining the bullish structure of an Ascending Triangle. Related Reading: Cardano Price Could Be Set For 100% Rally As This Bullish Triangle Has Formed On The Daily Timeframe Currently trading around $0.61, Cardano still faces resistance at $0.67. A confirmed close above this threshold could signal a breakout, potentially propelling its price toward the $0.73 – $0.75 range. However, despite these bullish technicals, macroeconomic uncertainty remains a key obstacle to ADA’s breakout potential. The ongoing US-China trade war tensions continue to fuel market volatility, creating headwinds for a sustained rally. The current market decline and instability fueled by this trade war have also kept many investors on the sidelines as they await stability.

33767162,[object Object],1745028010,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,XRP ETFs And A Price Surge: What To Expect If The SEC Gives Greenlight,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-etfs-and-a-price-surge/,"With the anticipation for the approval of XRP ETFs XRP ETFs by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) growing rapidly, the price of the cryptocurrency may be on the cusp of a dramatic surge . According to a crypto analyst, ETFs could become the ideal driver for a continual price rally for the altcoin fueled by a powerful combination of institutional demand and adoption. XRP ETFs Act As Fuel For Steady Price Surge In a recent podcast , a crypto analyst identified as ‘Good Morning Crypto’ and a speaker on X (formerly Twitter) discussed how the approval and launch of an XRP ETF could positively influence the cryptocurrency’s price. The speaker likened these ETFs to “giant vacuum cleaners” placed over the XRP pool, sucking up all of the available liquidity directly from the asset. Each time someone invests in one of these financial instruments, the XRP used is transferred into a secure custodian and effectively taken out of circulation, no longer available for trading or use. At present, nine companies have officially filed for an XRP ETF in the US. However, these filings are still under review and awaiting approval by the US SEC. Rumors are swirling that BlackRock , the world’s largest asset manager with over $11 trillion in Assets Under Management (AUM) , may be preparing to announce its own XRP ETF. If true, this move could dramatically speed up both the demand shock and adoption rate of XRP . The influx of investor interest and the shift in sentiment if the SEC greenlights XRP ETF would likely create upward pressure on the cryptocurrency’s price, potentially driving it to new highs . The speaker also illustrated a scenario in which the market gets new US laws and legislation passed by August—things like market infrastructure bills, tax clarity, and stablecoin rules. Once these are settled, he predicts that businesses and financial institutions will begin using XRP for payments . More so, over time, these companies will need to use the network every day to operate. As cryptocurrency becomes increasingly integrated into daily financial activity, companies watch as their ETF counterparts continue buying up the altcoin, contributing to its price growth. In anticipation of an ETF-driven scarcity, businesses may begin acquiring large amounts of XRP in advance, potentially adopting a buy-and-hold strategy before prices climb even higher. This creates what’s known in commodity markets as a “front-loading effect,” where anticipated future price increases lead to aggressive present-day buying. As a result, the analyst believes that the ongoing demand from ETFs and daily users could be “the perfect storm for a price surge.” The Altcoin’s Price Predicted To Hit $9 Soon Now, back in the spotlight, the XRP price is forecasted to experience an explosive breakout to $9.08. According to the Crypto General on X, after recording a significant rally to new highs above $3 this year, the token has been trading within a tight range. A TradingView chart shared by the crypto expert shows the formation of a classic Bull Pennant pattern — a typical continuation signal that often precedes sharp upward movement. The analyst notes that despite the tightening range, the altcoin is moving as planned, with price action respecting key support levels and building pressure below resistance. The key levels on the XRP price chart include a final target of $9.08 and support areas around $1.97 and $0.94.",XRP|Assets Under Management|AUM|BlackRock|Classic Bull Pennat Pattern|Crypto General|Good morning Crypto|Stbalecoin|XRP ETFs|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|RUNE|FET|SEI|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-04-19 02:00:10

The initial rollout will see millions of users—called Pioneers—transition to the open network. The plan also introduces new incentives, including referral bonuses for verified users. However, the network did not provide any anticipated dates or timelines . This has annoyed and startled many initial supporters. According to the roadmap, migration will take place in three key phases. First, Pi’s initial migrations will be done. This includes confirmed mining rewards, security circle rewards, lockup bonuses, app usage bonuses, and confirmed Node rewards for some. Secondly, it will implement referral mining rewards. But only if the referrals have undergone KYC (Know Your Customer) checks. The second phase will be initiated once the migration queue of the current version of Kin drives is completed. At last, Pi will initiate periodic migrations on a continuous time scale. The team says this could be once a month or once a quarter. But once again, no specific timetable was provided. Community flags gaps and raises concerns Several missing details have many Pioneers concerned. According to reports, some node operators have received rewards. But it remains unclear whom those payments are for and why. Without fair rules, early Node runners worry they might lose out. Meanwhile, some users have been dutifully clicking their “claim” button daily but have been surprised not to see their coins. They are wondering when base rewards and referral bonuses will finally come in. The user interface is a concern as well. The roadmap concedes that its “Transferable Balance” figure could be less than the actual amount. This has left many of the Pioneers fearing their real Pi coins are merely hidden or postponed. The network offers customers no visible solution to correcting mistakes if they find mistakes in their mining records, adding to the concern. Conflicts after six years of mining operations will certainly occur, but the roadmap does not indicate how those problems can be solved. Users push for answers amid ongoing uncertainty While the plan is well structured, the lack of specific timelines has worried some Pioneers. Adding to the uncertainty is a lack of clarity on how many users are currently in line to migrate and the network’s daily migration capacity. ​ Moreover, the roadmap admits that the UI’s “Transferable Balance” underestimates migrated amounts to save resources. Users fear this pessimistic display could erode trust if their true balances remain hidden. A frustrated community member questioned whether Pi Network ever had a real blockchain, saying they had believed they were mining PI coins and that the Security Circles formed the consensus mechanism. Still, now it seemed to them that there was no blockchain at all, and they wondered what kind of blockchain protocol would require all tokens to be minted at Genesis.​ The timing also fails to consider how many token unlock events will be aligned with migration waves — e.g., the approximately 108.9 million PI tokens unlocked this month. A handful of Pioneers have raised eyebrows about the project’s foundational narrative, suggesting that Pi’s claim that “all tokens were minted at genesis” runs counter to six years of “mining.” This mismatch questions whether Pi ever ran on an actual blockchain protocol.

While headlines are glued to Bitcoin’s political entanglements and Stellar’s real-world asset moves, there’s a silent disruptor that’s quietly building the very infrastructure both might need in the next chapter—Qubetics. The crypto market isn’t just looking for price action anymore. It’s demanding platforms that deliver something usable, scalable, and dependable for real-life problems. Qubetics ($TICS) is not playing catch-up—it’s building the tracks for a new kind of cross-chain financial reality. Unlike first-gen assets stuck in single-lane frameworks, Qubetics is enabling multi-chain transactions through its Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet. It’s designed to give full control to users, with zero centralized custody and full interoperability across blockchains. Real-life use cases? Countless. From small businesses handling invoices across borders to large firms syncing loyalty tokens across different chain ecosystems—this tech is built for those ready to move past theoretical models and into operational utility. That’s why many now consider it the next best crypto to buy before demand hits critical mass. Qubetics ($TICS): Redefining Blockchain Utility Through Multi-Chain Access Qubetics is laying the groundwork for what decentralized finance should’ve been from day one: fully interoperable, non-custodial, and accessible to anyone, regardless of the chain they use. The highlight here is the Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet, which lets users send, store, and swap tokens across different blockchains without giving up control or relying on custodians. Imagine a logistics firm syncing supply chain tokens between Ethereum and Avalanche without going through clunky bridges. Or an e-commerce store managing rewards tokens issued on Polygon and SUI, right from one dashboard. That’s what Qubetics unlocks. Users stay in control, and transactions stay on-chain without permissioned bottlenecks. And the traction is real. Qubetics is now in Stage 30 of its crypto presale , with a current price of $0.1729. Over 508 million $TICS tokens have been acquired by 24,900+ community members, and the presale has already surpassed $16.2 million. For many early participants, this might already feel like a ticket to the frontline of the next best crypto to buy. Unlike hype-driven coins, Qubetics is engineered around tools that plug directly into business processes and financial ecosystems. What Happens If You Put $100 into Qubetics Right Now? At the current presale price of $0.1729, a $100 investment fetches 578 $TICS tokens. If $TICS hits just $1, you’re looking at $578, a 478% return. If it explodes to $10—a target some analysts say isn’t far-fetched in this altcoin run—your $100 would skyrocket into $5,780. For just $100, you could turn passive capital into serious money. That’s the kind of upside that doesn’t come knocking twice. Bitcoin (BTC): Still the Standard, But Under New Political Pressure Bitcoin remains the digital gold, but now it’s also becoming a geopolitical chess piece. As of March 2025, the U.S. has launched a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, holding seized BTC assets indefinitely to back digital dominance. That bold move sparked strong reactions worldwide, with the European Central Bank warning of sovereignty risks and nations like Belarus expanding mining efforts in response. While the political side unfolds, price action reflects the tension. After peaking at $105,000 in January, Bitcoin dipped below $85,000 in March. Despite volatility, institutions are buying heavily. Goldman Sachs holds over $1.5 billion in Bitcoin ETFs, JPMorgan holds over $500,000, and BlackRock’s IBIT crossed $20 billion. Altogether, ETF inflows have hit $55 billion, shrinking the liquid supply and reinforcing Bitcoin’s status. Still, the problem remains: Bitcoin doesn’t do interoperability. It’s the store of value, yes, but not the infrastructure for flexible on-chain interactions. As new entrants demand usability alongside store-of-value strength, BTC might no longer be the next best crypto to buy, but rather the old guard to hold. Stellar (XLM): Tokenizing Finance With Institutional Strength Stellar is on a mission to bridge traditional finance and blockchain through real-world asset tokenization. In 2025 alone, it plans to tokenize over $3 billion worth of real-world assets, aiming to facilitate over $110 billion in volume. This isn’t a far-off goal—it’s already happening. Franklin Templeton recently launched a fully tokenized U.S. Treasury fund on Stellar. Taurus, a Deutsche Bank-backed provider, integrated Stellar into its custody platform. And Ondo Finance rolled out USDY, an income-generating stablecoin, using Stellar’s infrastructure. These moves reflect institutional confidence and growing on-chain utility. Stellar’s metrics back it up. With 9+ million active addresses, $458 million in tokenized RWAs, $4.1 billion in quarterly payment volume, and over 5.57 million daily operations, the network is proving its scale and throughput. But while Stellar excels in focused financial tokenization, it lacks the full cross-chain operability that defines the next best crypto to buy in today’s multi-chain age. Why These Three Matter in 2025 Qubetics, Bitcoin, and Stellar aren’t just tech stacks—they’re directions. Qubetics points forward, offering modular tools and multi-chain access for a decentralized future that actually works for real use cases. Bitcoin remains the reserve asset that every institutional fund wants exposure to, while Stellar has become the bridge connecting off-chain institutions to on-chain systems. Yet among them, only Qubetics is building tools that simplify blockchain use for the average business or application. It isn’t locked to one chain, and it doesn’t require permissioned entry points. It’s a decentralized infrastructure built to work anywhere, and that’s exactly the kind of thing that makes it the next best crypto to buy before it exits presale and enters the open market. Conclusion: One Is Solving the Problem, Two Are Setting the Stage The market is shifting. Those chasing hype are being outpaced by projects delivering tools that solve structural inefficiencies. Bitcoin is still a symbol of value and financial rebellion. Stellar is giving real-world institutions access to tokenization. But Qubetics? It’s equipping blockchain with tools that could finally make multi-chain functionality a standard, not a privilege. It’s no longer just about holding coins—it’s about choosing tools that’ll be indispensable when the next digital economy cycle begins. The next best crypto to buy is the one building the rails, not just riding the waves. And that makes Qubetics a front-runner worth a deep dive today.

Qubetics offers a Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet that enables seamless, cross-chain asset handling without centralization—solving a real gap in the crypto infrastructure. How is Stellar being used for real-world applications in 2025? Stellar is facilitating real-world asset tokenization with backing from major institutions like Franklin Templeton and Deutsche Bank-backed Taurus. Why is Bitcoin still relevant despite its limitations? Bitcoin remains a global store of value with growing institutional backing, especially after the U.S. introduced a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in 2025.

At the time of writing, the asset is trading at $84,596, down 0.1% in the last 24 hours. This places BTC approximately 22% below its all-time high of over $109,000 set earlier this year. The price action follows a recovery from earlier lows but remains range-bound, suggesting hesitancy among investors as macroeconomic uncertainties persist. One of the emerging observations comes from CryptoQuant analyst Crypto Dan, who compared Bitcoin’s current behavior to past correction cycles. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Still Close To Extreme Fear—Green Sign For Recovery? Speculation Eases, Setting the Stage for Potential Recovery In Dan’s recent QuickTake post titled “Cryptocurrency Market, Similar to the 2024 Correction Period,” Dan assessed the speculative dynamics of the market through the lens of short-term holder activity. His analysis suggests that the recent cooling-off period might mirror patterns observed during last year’s correction phase. According to Dan, one reliable gauge of market overheating is the percentage of Bitcoin supply held for one week to one month. When this metric rises, it often signals speculative enthusiasm, which can precede corrections. During previous bullish phases, such increases in short-term holdings were followed by pullbacks, marking peaks in investor exuberance. In the current cycle, Dan notes that this metric has once again reached a region previously associated with market bottoms—the same yellow box (on the chart shared) that aligned with the 2024 correction low. Based on this, he posits that speculative excesses have largely subsided, opening the door to renewed price growth if macroeconomic conditions continue to improve. However, he also emphasized that further consolidation may still occur before a broader trend shift materializes. Crypto Market, Similar to the 2024 Correction “Given that this ratio has now reached the yellow-box region, which was the bottom of the 2024 correction period, it seems likely that the current market will follow a similar path as the 2024 correction.” – By @DanCoinInvestor pic.twitter.com/YGNZxQnUXj — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) April 18, 2025 Bitcoin Whale Activity Suggests Imminent Volatility Complementing this analysis, CryptoQuant contributor Mignolet pointed out a notable shift in coin movement behavior. In a separate post, he observed that around 170,000 BTC recently moved from the 3–6 month holding cohort. This group typically includes mid-term holders, and substantial activity from them has historically preceded increased price volatility. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Futures Sentiment Weakens, Is The Ongoing Recovery Running Out of Steam? Mignolet illustrated his findings with data, noting that such movements have often signaled major price action, both upward and downward. Green box indicators on his chart marked rallies, while red boxes highlighted periods of decline. While the direction remains uncertain, he highlighted that the increased activity is an early warning sign that traders should be alert for a breakout or breakdown in the near future.
