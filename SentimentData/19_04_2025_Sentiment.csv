However, analyst Dr. Cat has warned that, contrary to public opinion, this development is bearish, not bullish, for the flagship crypto. In an X post, Dr. Cat stated that Bitcoin entering oversold levels is “super-bearish” and overbought levels are “super-bullish.” He explained that for the oscillator to reach oversold values, it means that the price action has been extremely bearish, indicating why investors are selling their holdings. Why Bitcoin Entering Oversold Levels Is Bearish The crypto analyst further remarked that Oscillators are range-bound indicators, so they can’t go beyond 0 and 100, as they are limited by their mathematical formulas. However, he added that the Bitcoin price can go lower or higher. Dr. Cat then alluded to Bitcoin’s bull markets, noting that all of them are in overbought territory on the weekly chart.

However, he remarked that whoever advises buying a weekly oversold chart based on the claim that it is bullish because it is oversold has no idea what they are talking about. He remarked that many altcoins are oversold on the higher timeframe and can remain oversold as they approach zero, where the analyst claims they are eventually headed. Dr. Cat also explained that in a bull market, oversold conditions on the daily chart may mark higher lows on the weekly or monthly chart. However, in a bear market, oversold conditions may persist or just lead to some consolidation before more downside. Dr. Cat then alluded to Quinten’s chart, which he said showed what daily oversold conditions led to one year earlier in different broader market conditions. The analyst cautioned that he wasn’t discussing whether Bitcoin is in a bull or bear market or where it is headed, but simply clarifying the misconception about oversold and overbought RSI. BTC’s Supply Overwhelming Demand At The Moment In an X post, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju revealed that Bitcoin’s supply is currently greater than its demand at the moment, providing a bearish outlook for the flagship crypto. This supports the idea of BTC being in oversold conditions right now, with holders selling their coins rather than buying.

At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $84,600, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

43503505,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=712233,1745013621,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/43503505.jpeg,Retail investors keep buying the dip but what happens when the market doesn’t bounce back?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/retail-investors-keep-buying-the-dip/,"Retail investors are still rushing to “buy the dip,” but market veterans warn the strategy could fail if share prices keep falling instead of bouncing back. For most of the past 15 years, buying every dip has worked. Brief recessions, including the 2020 downturn and the 2022 bear market, were followed by quick, strong rebounds. Anyone who started investing during that era might think that sell-offs are only temporary. “If, anytime, there’s a sell‑off, it’s just a buying opportunity, why would you ever stop that?” Scott Sheridan said to MarketWatch . He added, “These people have never seen a down move up until the last couple of weeks.” The latest shock came after the White House announced sweeping tariffs on April 2. From April 2 to April 7, the S&P 500 dropped 11 %, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid more than 10 %, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 12 %. On the other hand, the Cboe Volatility Index peaked near 52 on April 8, and on April 9, the S&P 500 logged its best single‑day gain since 2008, jumping 9.5%, before slipping again in the following sessions. Small traders were on a buying spree despite Wall Street’s concerns over the economic impact of tariffs JPMorgan data shows $21 billion in equities inflows between April 3 and April 16, far above normal levels. April 3 alone drew $4.7 billion, the largest single‑day haul the bank has recorded. JPMorgan says the urge to buy the dip has grown stronger since 2022. Retail flows increased after Trump’s April 2 tariff announcement. Source: BNY “Retail has been continuously buying dips since the pandemic,” said Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial. “But that trade worked out great. It has not broken until now, where maybe they bought the first 3% to 5% down, and now they’re underwater.” Bob Savage, head of markets macro strategy at BNY, warned that the strategy can fail. “Outsized moves down have a tipping point linked to volatility and the state of the economy,” he wrote, adding that the rest of April depends on how the Federal Open Market Committee responds. “The history of 2008 trading suggests you need a bigger policy to turn the dip to work.” Turnquist noted that if investors buy the first dip and the market keeps sliding or recovers slowly, they sit on losses for an unknown period. No one can forecast when the next rebound will arrive. Sheridan used a rubber band example. Stretch it and it snaps back, stretch it again and it snaps back again. That has been the pattern for years. In 2024 alone, the S&P 500 set 57 record closes, about one every 4.4 trading days. Yet rubber bands can break. Sheridan, who traded through the crashes of 1987, 2000, and 2008, worries the next prolonged slump will shock newcomers. “People who only began investing during the past 15 years have yet to experience something like that,” he said. Heavy dip buyers are at risk of steeper losses Trading platform Public reported a jump in customers moving money out of high‑yield cash accounts to buy stocks. Sam Nofzinger, Public’s general manager of crypto and brokerage, said, “People have been sitting on mountains of cash for the past year and finally see [an opportunity to invest],”. A deeper recession would not only drive prices lower; it could threaten jobs and incomes, slicing the money that fuels dip buying. “You really need a dot‑com or global financial crisis kind of situation for that to unfold,” Turnquist said. “And who knows. That’s not in our playbook for this year or next year.” Whenever the next severe downturn arrives, heavy dip‑buyers risk steeper losses and, Sheridan fears, may quit the market altogether. Still, he remains optimistic about the long run. “The good news is the markets are resilient. The markets are going to come back in time. There is no doubt in my mind that we will be significantly higher in the markets in the next 5, 10, 15 or 20 years,” he said. “The question is, what does it look like before we get there? And how many people do we lose?” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

The gloves are off as crypto giant Coinbase fiercely defends itself against a lawsuit from Oregon. Accusing the state of recycling discredited theories and undermining the push for clear federal rules, Coinbase is not backing down. Let’s dive into why this baseless lawsuit is making waves and what it means for the future of crypto regulations. Coinbase Lawsuit: A Clash Over Crypto Regulation Coinbase is hitting back hard against Oregon’s legal challenge, labeling it a ‘baseless attempt to revive discredited legal theories.’ This strong language underscores the company’s frustration and determination to fight what it perceives as an unfair and outdated attack. But what exactly is Oregon alleging, and why is Coinbase so vehemently opposed? Oregon’s Claims: While the specifics of Oregon’s lawsuit haven’t been detailed in the initial reports, Coinbase suggests the state is attempting to apply outdated legal frameworks to the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrency. Coinbase’s Defense: Coinbase argues that these legal theories have already been rejected by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), implying a lack of merit in Oregon’s approach. Undermining Federal Efforts: A key part of Coinbase’s argument is that this lawsuit disrupts the ongoing bipartisan efforts in Washington D.C. to establish clear and consistent federal crypto regulations . This legal battle isn’t just about Coinbase and Oregon; it’s a microcosm of the larger struggle to define and regulate the crypto industry in the United States. The outcome could set precedents and influence how other states and federal agencies approach crypto regulation in the future. Why ‘Baseless Lawsuit’ is Coinbase’s Key Argument Coinbase’s repeated use of the term ‘baseless lawsuit’ isn’t just rhetoric; it’s a strategic legal and public relations move. By framing the Oregon lawsuit as lacking foundation, Coinbase aims to: Discredit the Claims: Immediately cast doubt on the legitimacy of Oregon’s legal action in the eyes of the public and the broader crypto community. Rally Support: Position itself as a victim of overreach, potentially garnering support from industry stakeholders, investors, and even crypto-friendly lawmakers. Strengthen Legal Position: Signal a strong defense and potentially influence the court’s perception of the case from the outset. The ‘baseless’ label is a powerful tool to control the narrative and put pressure on Oregon to justify its legal challenge. It’s a clear indication that Coinbase intends to fight this case aggressively. The SEC Crypto Factor: A History of Discredited Theories? Coinbase’s statement that Oregon is trying to revive legal theories ‘previously abandoned by the U.S. SEC’ is particularly noteworthy. This alludes to past instances where the SEC may have explored certain regulatory approaches to crypto, only to later move away from them. This could mean Oregon is: Using Old Playbooks: Potentially relying on legal interpretations that the federal regulator, the SEC, has deemed ineffective or inappropriate for the current crypto landscape. Ignoring Industry Evolution: Failing to recognize the advancements and changes within the crypto industry since these older theories were considered and possibly discarded. Creating Regulatory Conflict: Risking a conflict with federal regulatory trends if Oregon’s approach diverges significantly from the SEC’s current stance on SEC crypto regulation. Understanding the specific SEC theories Coinbase is referencing will be crucial in assessing the validity of their ‘baseless lawsuit’ claim. It highlights the complexity of navigating state versus federal regulation in the rapidly evolving crypto space. Crypto Regulations in the Crosshairs: Federal vs. State The Coinbase-Oregon standoff throws a spotlight on the ongoing tension between state and federal oversight of crypto regulations . Here’s a breakdown of the key issues: Issue Federal Approach State Approach (Example: Oregon Lawsuit) Consistency Aims for uniform rules across the nation, preventing a patchwork of conflicting state laws. Can lead to regulatory fragmentation, making it harder for crypto businesses to operate nationally. Innovation Ideally balances consumer protection with fostering innovation and growth in the crypto sector. Risk of stifling innovation if state regulations are overly restrictive or misinformed about crypto technology. Expertise Federal agencies like the SEC and CFTC are developing specialized expertise in crypto regulation. State regulators may have varying levels of crypto expertise, potentially leading to less informed regulations. Political Landscape Subject to federal legislative processes, often slower but potentially more comprehensive and bipartisan. State regulations can be influenced by local political climates and may not align with national or global trends. Coinbase’s argument about undermining bipartisan federal efforts emphasizes the industry’s preference for a unified national framework for crypto regulations . They believe that a state-by-state approach, especially one perceived as ‘baseless’ or outdated, creates unnecessary hurdles and uncertainty. What’s Next for Coinbase and Oregon? Coinbase has made it clear: they will ‘fight the case’ while maintaining normal operations in Oregon. This legal battle could unfold in several ways: Court Proceedings: Expect a potentially lengthy legal process involving filings, arguments, and possibly appeals. Settlement的可能性: While Coinbase is projecting a strong stance, settlements are always a possibility in litigation, although unlikely given the strong rhetoric. Legislative Impact: This case could further fuel the debate in Washington about the need for federal crypto legislation, potentially adding urgency to bipartisan efforts. Industry-Wide Implications: The outcome will be closely watched by the entire crypto industry, as it could influence future regulatory challenges and the balance of power between state and federal authorities. A Fight for the Future of Crypto Regulation The Coinbase-Oregon lawsuit is more than just a legal dispute between a company and a state. It’s a significant battleground in the larger war over how cryptocurrency will be regulated in the United States. Coinbase’s aggressive defense and its framing of the Oregon lawsuit as ‘baseless’ signal a determination to push back against what it sees as misguided and obstructive state-level actions. As this case progresses, it will undoubtedly shape the ongoing conversation about crypto regulation and the future of the digital asset industry.

This happened just a few days after the attack was discovered. Instead of using legal threats or launching an investigation, KiloEx tried a different method. This method could set a precedent and change how similar cases are handled. How the Hack Happened On April 14, Cyvers, a blockchain security firm, detected a serious breach on KiloEx. The main problem came from the platform’s price oracle, a tool that gives price updates to the exchange. Sadly, the attacker found a way to manipulate this tool. The attacker exploited the system’s weakness and took advantage of price differences on several blockchains, like BNB, Base, and Taiko. The bad actor siphoned the stolen funds through a wallet on Tornado Cash, a crypto-mixing platform often used for money laundering and hiding stolen funds. The wallet used in the hack received money through Tornado Cash. Tornado Cash is a tool that mixes different crypto transactions to hide where the money comes from. Hackers and criminals often use it to cover their tracks and move stolen money without being caught. This got people worried that the money might be lost forever. However, KiloEx did not give up. Hacker Returns $7.5M, Gets $750,000 Reward Soon after the breach, KiloEx made an unusual proposal. The exchange told the attacker that if the money were returned, it would receive 10% as a reward. This kind of reward, often called a bounty , is typically offered to white-hat hackers, who are ethical hackers who help expose security flaws without harming others. To everyone’s surprise, the attacker returned all the stolen funds. KiloEx said it would be true to its word and give the hacker 10% of the recovered amount, which amounts to $750,000. The company said the reward was a way of thanking the individual for helping improve its security. KiloEx Solves Hack Issue with No Legal Battle Rather than press charges or open a legal case, KiloEx said it considers the issue resolved. The company praised the outcome and emphasized building trust with ethical hackers. The exchange believes that working with security experts is a better way to protect users and grow stronger as a platform. So far this year, hackers and exploiters have stolen about $2 billion from different platforms. In most cases, the funds were never recovered, and the attackers vanished. Yu Xian, a respected figure in blockchain security, said the decision to return the funds and claim the bounty is rare and difficult. However, it might be the smartest option for hackers who realize the damage they could cause.

According to a new report , the three leaders of Braiscompany, which perpetrated the scheme, were sentenced for defrauding investors out of nearly $190 million, or $1.1 billion Brazilian Reals. The report says the company’s main operator, Joel Ferreira de Souza, was handed a sentence of 128 years behind bars, while the other two perpetrators, Gesana Rayane Silva and Victor Augusto Veronez de Souza, were given sentences of 28 and 15 years, respectively. According to authorities, the trio promised “exorbitant” returns on the crypto investments of their victims in order to initially get their funds and engaged in money laundering. Ferreira de Souza was found to be controlling crypto portfolios through third parties, as well as using shell companies to facilitate his crimes. He was convicted of 11 counts of money laundering, while Reyane Silva, the firm’s broker, was found responsible for intermediating financial transactions and transporting funds. De Souza, Joel’s son, was also found guilty of being involved with one of the companies involved in the illegal transactions. The judge in the case said that proceeds from the scam should go directly to the government. However, Artêmio Picanço – the lawyer representing the victims of Braiscompany – argued on one of his social media accounts that the fund should go directly to the victims.

Mid Term Price Prediction For RENDER & TIA,https://bitzo.com/2025/04/render-celestia-kickstart-a-climb-will-the-rally-continue-mid-term-price-prediction-for-render-tia,"Render and Celestia have started showing signs of upward movement in the crypto market. Traders and investors are watching closely, wondering if this momentum will keep building. This article dives into the details and provides a mid-term price forecast for RENDER and TIA, aiming to uncover which of these digital assets might be primed for significant growth. Crypto Price Snapshot and Technical Overview The RENDER experienced a 25% gain over the past month and a 17% boost within the last week. Over a six-month period, the price dropped by 25%, reflecting a mixed performance with sharp short-term rallies contrasted by a longer-term decline. These movements signify rapid shifts in sentiment where recent gains may indicate renewed interest, despite an overall weakness observed in the half-year view. The current trading zone ranges between $2.46 and $4.42, with a key support level at $1.52 and resistance near $5.43 along with a secondary resistance at $7.39. Price action appears delicate with no definitive trend, suggesting bulls may be cautiously testing gains while bears maintain pressure near lower levels. Traders might consider buying near support and monitoring resistance for potential exits. Celestia Price Outlook and Market Levels TIA showed a 26.12% decline over the last month and a 59.19% slide over the past six months, with a small weekly drop of 2.34%. Price moves have been steep and led to marked shifts in sentiment, with volatility defining its recent performance. Indicators point to fading momentum as the market adjusts, highlighting a clear downward trend during these intervals. Current trading sees Celestia moving between $2.31 and $4.17. Resistance sits near $5.28, with a second push expected around $7.14, while support is seen at $1.55. Bears hold sway for now, with the price failing to break higher and a lack of strong directional trend. Cautious trades within these levels could test resistance and find new support at the current key level. Conclusion The recent surge in RENDER and TIA signals a renewed interest in these coins. Market sentiment appears strong, driven by positive developments and community support. While current trends favor continued growth, monitoring broader market conditions is crucial. Both RENDER and TIA have shown potential, but their long-term performance will depend on sustained momentum and adoption. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

It felt like every other company was going public via a Special Purpose Acquisition Company. Then, the hype faded, and SPACs seemed to lose their luster. But hold on – could we be witnessing a surprising SPAC comeback ? Kodiak Robotics, a self-driving truck startup, is making headlines by choosing the SPAC route to the public market, merging with Ares Acquisition Corporation II. This bold move raises eyebrows, especially given the recent struggles and shutdowns in the autonomous vehicle sector, not to mention the generally shaky IPO landscape. Is this a lone wolf, or the start of a new SPAC wave? Let’s unpack this. Is the SPAC Comeback Really Happening? The big question on everyone’s mind: is the SPAC comeback real ? Kodiak Robotics’ decision certainly suggests a pulse in the SPAC world. But it’s happening against a backdrop of considerable uncertainty in the broader IPO market. As highlighted on Bitcoin World’s Equity podcast, featuring Kirsten Korosec, Max Zeff, and Anthony Ha, the expected blockbuster IPO year of 2025 is looking less certain. Major players like Klarna and StubHub have pumped the brakes on their public debut plans. Investor Mark Goldberg even quipped that those waiting for a fintech IPO wave this year might be waiting a long time. So, why SPACs, and why now? Here’s a breakdown of factors at play: Uncertain IPO Market Conditions : Traditional IPOs require extensive roadshows and market confidence. In a volatile market, SPACs offer a potentially faster and more certain path to going public, even if it means negotiating valuation with a SPAC sponsor. SPACs Seeking Deals : Many SPACs raised capital during the boom and are now under pressure to find merger targets before their deadlines expire. This creates a supply of SPACs looking for companies, potentially making it an attractive option for private companies seeking liquidity. Kodiak Robotics’ Bold Bet : For Kodiak, the SPAC route might offer access to capital and public markets at a time when traditional funding rounds are tougher to secure for autonomous vehicle companies, especially after the setbacks of Embark and TuSimple. However, it’s crucial to remember the challenges that led to the SPAC market cooling down in the first place: SPAC Performance History : Post-merger SPAC performance has often been lackluster, with many companies underperforming market expectations. This has made investors wary. Regulatory Scrutiny : Increased regulatory attention on SPACs has added complexity and potentially deterred some companies and investors. Market Saturation : The sheer volume of SPACs in 2021 led to deal fatigue and a decline in investor enthusiasm. Autonomous Vehicles and the IPO Landscape Kodiak Robotics operating in the autonomous vehicles space adds another layer of intrigue. This sector has faced significant headwinds recently. The closures of Embark and TuSimple, mentioned in the original article, underscore the capital-intensive and long-term nature of developing and deploying self-driving technology. Going public via SPAC could be a strategic move for Kodiak to secure funding and visibility in a challenging environment. However, investor sentiment towards autonomous vehicles is currently mixed. While the long-term potential is undeniable, the path to profitability and widespread adoption remains uncertain. Key Considerations for Kodiak Robotics’ SPAC Move: Factor Potential Impact Market Sentiment for Autonomous Vehicles Could be a headwind if investors are still cautious about the sector’s near-term prospects. SPAC Partner (Ares Acquisition Corporation II) A strong and reputable SPAC sponsor can lend credibility and support to the deal. Valuation and Deal Terms Attractive valuation and deal terms are crucial to attract investors and ensure long-term success as a public company. Execution and Roadmap Clear execution plans and a realistic roadmap for commercialization will be vital to maintain investor confidence post-merger. Fintech IPOs: Still on Hold? The article also touches upon the broader fintech IPO landscape, quoting Mark Goldberg’s pessimistic view on an imminent wave. This context is important because it highlights the general hesitancy in the IPO market, not just for tech but specifically for fintech companies which were also darlings of the previous IPO boom. If even fintech giants are delaying public offerings, it underscores the challenging market conditions and makes Kodiak’s SPAC move even more noteworthy – and potentially risky. Other Key Highlights from the Equity Podcast: AI Voices Everywhere : Imagine Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, and Jeff Bezos’s AI voices guiding you at crosswalks. The podcast discussed the increasing pervasiveness of AI voices and its implications. Figma’s IPO Plans : The Equity crew is eagerly anticipating Figma’s S-1 filing, raising questions about its financials, growth strategy, and market positioning. Hugging Face’s Robotics Push : Hugging Face’s recent acquisition signals a deeper dive into humanoid robotics, expanding its AI footprint beyond software models. OpenAI’s Model Updates : Updates to OpenAI’s o3 and o4-mini models, and the anticipation for the grand GPT-5 launch, keep the AI world buzzing with excitement. Conclusion: A Glimmer of Hope or a False Dawn? Kodiak Robotics’ SPAC merger is undoubtedly a significant event. Whether it signals a true SPAC comeback or is merely an outlier remains to be seen. It’s a bold move in an uncertain market, particularly for the autonomous vehicle sector.

Elizabeth Warren,https://cointelegraph.com/news/firing-jerome-powell-crash-financial-markets-elizabeth-warren?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"US Senator Elizabeth Warren warned that if President Donald Trump eventually moves to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, it could undermine investor confidence in the integrity of US capital markets and trigger a financial crash. During an appearance on CNBC, the Massachusetts Senator said the President does not have the legal authority to remove Powell from his position. Moreover, removing Powell would weaken the financial infrastructure of the US, Warren added: ""If Chairman Powell can be fired by the President of the United States, it will crash the markets. The infrastructure that keeps this stock market strong and, therefore, a big part of our economy strong, and a big part of the world economy strong, is the idea that the big pieces move independently of politics."" ""If interest rates in the United States are subject to a president who just wants to wave his magic wand, this doesn't distinguish us from any other two-bit dictatorship,"" Warren continued. Trump discusses US economic policies with reporters. Source: The White House President Trump has repeatedly called for Powell's termination, citing the chairman's hesitancy to lower interest rates . Lower interest rates are usually considered a positive catalyst for risk-on asset prices, including cryptocurrencies, and could reverse the market downturn brought on by the trade war and current macroeconomic pressures. Related: Fed's Powell reasserts support for stablecoin legislation Trump's feud with the Federal Reserve chairman Trump criticized Powell for not cutting interest rates and called for his termination again in an April 17 Truth Social post , which inflamed speculation that he would follow through on threats and find a way to remove the chairman. Senator Rick Scott echoed Trump's calls to remove Powell. ""It’s time to clean house of everyone working at the Federal Reserve who isn’t on board with helping the American people and fighting for their best interests,"" Scott wrote in an opinion piece published on Fox News. Source: Donald Trump The Trump administration has repeatedly stated that lowering interest rates is a top priority. Market analyst and investor Anthony Pompliano recently speculated that Trump deliberately crashed financial markets to force lower interest rates. At the time, Pompliano cited a reduction in the yield of the 10-year US Treasury Bond to just 4%. The 10-year bond yield has climbed back up to 4.3% since then.

43503746,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=150813,1745014817,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Smarter ChatGPT: Revolutionizing Web Searches with Personalized Memory,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/smarter-chatgpt-personalized-search/,"For cryptocurrency enthusiasts always seeking the edge in market analysis and information gathering, the latest advancements in AI are not just interesting—they’re game-changing. OpenAI’s ChatGPT is pushing boundaries again, this time with a groundbreaking update that’s set to redefine how we interact with AI for web searches. Imagine an AI chatbot that not only understands your queries but also remembers your preferences, your past interactions, and uses this ‘memory’ to tailor web search results just for you. This isn’t science fiction; it’s the reality of ChatGPT’s new ‘Memory with Search’ feature, and it’s poised to make your information gathering faster, more relevant, and incredibly personalized. Unveiling ChatGPT’s Personalized Search : What’s New? OpenAI has just rolled out a significant enhancement to ChatGPT’s capabilities, dubbed ‘Memory with Search.’ This isn’t just a minor tweak; it’s a fundamental upgrade to how ChatGPT processes and responds to your queries, especially when those queries involve web searches. Building on its existing memory capabilities, this new feature allows ChatGPT to leverage details from your past conversations to refine and personalize your web search experience. Think of it as having a digital assistant that truly ‘knows’ you and uses that knowledge to get you the most relevant information from the vast expanse of the internet. Here’s a breakdown of what ‘Memory with Search’ brings to the table: Context-Aware Searches: ChatGPT now uses its ChatGPT memory of your previous conversations to understand the context of your current search. This means it doesn’t just treat each query in isolation but as part of an ongoing dialogue. Personalized Query Refinement: When you ask ChatGPT to search the web, it can rewrite your prompt to be more effective, incorporating details it remembers about you. This leads to search queries that are inherently more tailored to your needs and preferences. Seamless Integration: This feature is designed to work smoothly within the existing ChatGPT interface. If you’ve used ChatGPT’s memory feature before, ‘Memory with Search’ is a natural and powerful extension of that. This update is a clear move by OpenAI to distinguish ChatGPT from competitors like Claude and Gemini, both of which are also developing memory features. OpenAI is doubling down on creating a truly personalized and efficient AI chatbot experience. How Does Memory with Search Actually Work? Let’s dive into a practical example to illustrate the power of ‘Memory with Search.’ Imagine you’ve previously mentioned to ChatGPT that you’re interested in blockchain technology and live in London. Now, you ask ChatGPT, ‘What are some upcoming tech events near me?’ With ‘Memory with Search,’ ChatGPT doesn’t just perform a generic search. Instead, it intelligently rewrites your query, leveraging its ChatGPT memory . It might transform your simple question into a more specific search query like, ‘blockchain technology events London 2025.’ OpenAI provides another compelling example in their documentation: Consider a user who ChatGPT remembers is vegan and lives in San Francisco. If this user prompts, ‘what are some restaurants near me that I’d like,’ ChatGPT, with ‘Memory with Search,’ might refine this to ‘good vegan restaurants, San Francisco.’ This level of personalization ensures that the search results are not only geographically relevant but also aligned with your dietary preferences, making the information far more useful and less time-consuming to sift through. The Benefits of Personalized Search in the AI Era For users, especially those in fast-paced fields like cryptocurrency trading and analysis, the benefits of personalized search are substantial: Enhanced Relevance: Say goodbye to sifting through pages of irrelevant search results. ‘Memory with Search’ significantly increases the relevance of information you receive, saving you valuable time. Improved Efficiency: By understanding your context and preferences, ChatGPT streamlines the search process. You get to the information you need faster, allowing for quicker decision-making. More Intuitive Interaction: Conversing with ChatGPT becomes more natural and intuitive. It feels less like interacting with a machine and more like having a knowledgeable assistant who anticipates your needs. Competitive Edge: In dynamic markets like cryptocurrency, access to timely and highly relevant information is crucial. Personalized search can provide that edge, helping you stay ahead of market trends and make informed decisions faster. OpenAI Update : Differentiating ChatGPT in a Crowded Market The ‘Memory with Search’ feature is a strategic move by OpenAI update to further differentiate ChatGPT from its competitors. In a market increasingly crowded with sophisticated AI chatbots, standing out requires continuous innovation and user-centric features. By enhancing the ChatGPT memory capabilities and integrating them with web search, OpenAI is setting a new benchmark for personalized AI interactions. While Google’s Gemini and Anthropic’s Claude also offer memory features, OpenAI’s approach with ‘Memory with Search’ seems to be taking personalization a step further by directly influencing and refining the web search process itself. This is not just about remembering past conversations; it’s about actively using that memory to improve the quality and relevance of information retrieved from the web. Are There Any Concerns? Navigating the Challenges As with any AI advancement, especially one that involves ChatGPT memory and personalization, there are valid questions and potential concerns: Privacy: Users might be concerned about what personal information ChatGPT stores in its memory and how this data is used to personalize searches. OpenAI needs to be transparent about data handling and ensure robust privacy protections. Accuracy and Bias: Relying on past conversations to refine searches could introduce biases or inaccuracies if the initial memories are flawed or if the AI misinterprets past interactions. Continuous refinement and user feedback will be crucial to mitigate these risks. Control and Customization: Users need to have control over their ChatGPT memory . The ability to easily disable ‘Memory with Search,’ as mentioned in OpenAI’s documentation, is essential. Furthermore, granular control over what is remembered and used for personalization would be a welcome addition. OpenAI has already addressed the control aspect by allowing users to disable Memory in settings, giving users the option to opt out of personalized search if they prefer. Actionable Insights: Making the Most of Memory with Search Ready to leverage the power of Memory with Search ? Here are some actionable insights to get you started: Engage in Detailed Conversations: The richer your conversations with ChatGPT, the more comprehensive its memory becomes, leading to better personalized search results. Don’t hesitate to provide context and details in your interactions. Experiment with Different Queries: Try using ‘Memory with Search’ for various types of web searches to see how it refines and personalizes the results. Experiment with broad and specific queries to understand its capabilities fully. Review and Manage Your Memory: Regularly check your ChatGPT settings to manage your memory preferences. Ensure you are comfortable with the level of personalization and adjust settings as needed. Provide Feedback: As an early adopter, your feedback is invaluable. If you encounter issues or have suggestions for improvement, provide feedback to OpenAI to help refine this feature further. Conclusion: A Smarter, More Personalized AI Future OpenAI’s ‘Memory with Search’ is more than just an incremental OpenAI update ; it’s a significant leap towards creating truly intelligent and personalized AI assistants. By integrating ChatGPT memory with web search capabilities, OpenAI is paving the way for a future where AI interactions are not only more efficient but also deeply attuned to individual user needs and preferences. For those in the cryptocurrency and broader tech space, this advancement promises a smarter, faster, and more personalized way to navigate the vast digital landscape. As AI continues to evolve, features like ‘Memory with Search’ will be pivotal in shaping how we interact with and benefit from these powerful technologies.

Leading cryptocurrency exchange , Kraken, has just amplified its trading platform by introducing FX perpetual futures trading . Yes, you heard it right! Kraken Pro users can now dive into the dynamic world of forex markets, starting with the ever-popular EUR/USD and GBP/USD currency pairs. This move signifies a major expansion for Kraken, venturing beyond its core crypto offerings to tap into the vast potential of foreign exchange. Unveiling Kraken’s FX Perpetual Futures: What’s the Buzz? For those unfamiliar, perpetual futures are derivative contracts that, unlike traditional futures, don’t have an expiration date. This means you can hold positions indefinitely, mirroring the spot market but with the added leverage and flexibility of futures trading. Kraken’s foray into FX perpetual futures is a game-changer for several reasons: 24/7 Trading Access: Say goodbye to market closure limitations! Forex markets are renowned for their 24/5 operation, but Kraken is taking it a step further by offering 24/7 trading . This caters to the global nature of crypto and forex traders who operate across different time zones and prefer continuous market access. Diversification Beyond Crypto: Kraken, primarily known as a cryptocurrency exchange , is strategically diversifying its product range. By adding FX pairs, Kraken is appealing to a broader audience, including traditional forex traders who might be looking to explore crypto or simply want a platform that offers both. Leverage Opportunities: Perpetual futures inherently offer leverage, allowing traders to control larger positions with a smaller amount of capital. While leverage can amplify profits, it’s crucial to remember it also magnifies risks. Responsible risk management is key! Competitive Edge: By launching FX perpetual futures , Kraken is positioning itself to compete with established forex brokers and other crypto exchanges that may also offer FX products. This move could attract traders seeking a unified platform for both crypto and forex trading. Why Forex and Why Now for Kraken? The foreign exchange market is the largest and most liquid financial market globally, dwarfing even the stock markets in trading volume. The appeal of forex lies in its: High Liquidity: With trillions of dollars traded daily, forex markets offer unparalleled liquidity, ensuring tight spreads and efficient order execution. Volatility: Currency values are influenced by a multitude of factors – economic indicators, geopolitical events, interest rate changes, and more. This volatility presents numerous trading opportunities. Global Participation: Forex is a truly global market, with participants ranging from central banks and financial institutions to multinational corporations and individual traders worldwide. For Kraken, venturing into forex is a logical step to expand its market reach and cater to the evolving needs of its user base. The timing is also strategic, as interest in both crypto and forex markets remains robust, and traders are increasingly looking for comprehensive platforms that offer diverse trading instruments. Navigating the FX Perpetual Futures Landscape on Kraken Pro Kraken Pro users will find the new FX perpetual futures pairs integrated seamlessly into the platform. Here’s a quick guide on what to expect: Feature Details for FX Perpetual Futures on Kraken Pro Trading Pairs (Initial) EUR/USD, GBP/USD Trading Hours 24/7 Platform Kraken Pro Contract Type Perpetual Futures Leverage (Specific leverage details to be confirmed on Kraken Pro – traders should check platform for latest information) Actionable Insights for Traders: Explore the New Pairs: If you are a Kraken Pro user interested in forex, take advantage of the new EUR/USD and GBP/USD pairs. Familiarize yourself with their trading characteristics and volatility. Risk Management is Paramount: Especially with leveraged products like perpetual futures, robust risk management strategies are crucial. Use stop-loss orders and manage your position sizes wisely. Stay Informed: Forex markets are driven by global events. Keep abreast of economic news, central bank announcements, and geopolitical developments that can impact currency values. Platform Familiarization: If you’re new to Kraken Pro or futures trading, take time to explore the platform, understand the order types, and leverage settings before trading live. Challenges and Considerations While Kraken’s move into Forex trading is exciting, there are factors to consider: Competition: The forex market is highly competitive, with numerous established brokers. Kraken will need to differentiate itself to attract and retain forex traders. Regulatory Landscape: Regulations surrounding forex and crypto derivatives can vary across jurisdictions. Kraken needs to navigate these complexities to ensure compliance and global accessibility. Education and Support: Some crypto traders may be new to forex, and vice versa. Kraken might need to invest in educational resources and support to help users navigate this new offering effectively. Market Volatility: Both crypto and forex markets can be volatile. Traders need to be prepared for rapid price swings and manage their risk accordingly. Conclusion: A Bold Step into a Broader Trading Universe Kraken’s launch of 24/7 FX perpetual futures trading is undoubtedly a significant step forward. It demonstrates the exchange’s ambition to become a comprehensive trading platform, bridging the gap between the crypto and traditional financial worlds. By offering forex trading alongside its robust crypto offerings, Kraken is providing traders with more opportunities, greater flexibility, and access to a wider range of markets. As the platform evolves and potentially adds more FX pairs and features, it will be interesting to watch how this bold move shapes Kraken’s future and the broader trading landscape.

But here’s the real question on investors’ minds: If you’re putting $100 or $1,000 into the market right now—what’s delivering the best return by 2026? That’s where MAGACOINFINANCE is entering the conversation with hard ROI math that’s too good to ignore . 🚨 FINAL CALL — ACT NOW & SECURE YOUR SPOT! The ROI Breakdown – $1,000 in 2025 Could Look Very Different Let’s say you’re investing $1,000 today. Here’s how it could play out: BTC at 2x → $1,000 becomes $2,000 XRP at 4x → $1,000 becomes $4,000 ETH at 3x–4x → $1,000 becomes up to $4,000 ADA and LINK → both projected around 3x returns SUI → high-growth potential, possibly 5x Now compare that to MAGACOINFINANCE , which has been forecasted by early-stage investors and analysts to deliver 25x or more in its upcoming cycle . MAGACOINFINANCE at 25x → $1,000 becomes $25,000 That’s the kind of math that creates life-changing portfolio shifts—not just solid gains. 📈 2025’S MOST TALKED ABOUT CRYPTO — JOIN 12,500+ INVESTORS TODAY! Why MAGACOINFINANCE Could Outperform Every Top 10 Coin Unlike BTC and ETH, which have already gone through multiple exponential growth phases, MAGACOINFINANCE is still in its pre-mainstream launch window . It’s gaining traction rapidly across social channels, crypto newsletters, and Telegram investor groups—and it’s offering pre-listing access + bonus incentives like MAGA50X . The ROI formula is simple: early + structured + low market cap = outsized returns . 🔓 50% EXTRA BONUS LIVE — USE CODE MAGA50X BEFORE IT’S GONE! What About ADA, ETH, LINK, and SUI? All strong contenders for long-term performance. Cardano (ADA) offers reliability in DeFi. Ethereum (ETH) continues to dominate infrastructure-level innovation.

But here’s the truth: none of them are offering the 25x potential of MAGACOINFINANCE right now—and that’s what ROI-focused investors are prioritizing in 2025. Conclusion BTC, XRP, and ETH are still ranked at the top—but in terms of pure upside potential, MAGACOINFINANCE is in a category of its own . For investors looking to turn $100 into something serious, the ROI math makes the choice obvious.

Crypto Twitter’s been buzzing lately—and not for the usual suspects. While most of the market is still playing cautious, meme coins like DEGEN are picking up traction fast, and PONKE is almost at full token circulation, signaling a rare early-bird advantage for those watching closely. The energy is unmistakable—new players are moving in as the top new meme coins to join today, whales are loading up, and momentum is shifting in real time. Right at the center of this resurgence sits BTFD Coin (BTFD) —the one meme coin that’s not just hyped, but heavily loaded with substance, features, and undeniable numbers. In a sea of volatility, presales like BTFD keep you safe from market swings, giving you entry at set pricing while the storm rages outside. The BTFD presale has already become a rallying point for over 11,800+ holders, raising more than $6.54 million and selling over 72 billion coins.

These top new meme coins to join today might just be your ticket to crypto’s next wave of breakout wealth. BTFD Coin (BTFD): Is This Your $1K Into $30K Moment?

In a space that usually runs on nothing but hype, BTFD is stacking real fundamentals behind the frenzy. Backed by a live P2E game, 90% APY staking rewards, and a community that’s growing by the hour, BTFD isn’t just another meme coin presale —it’s a movement among the top new meme coins to join today and win big. Let’s talk numbers for a sec. Buying in at $0.0002 during Stage 15, a $1,000 investment nets you 5 million BTFD coins. At listing, that becomes $3,000 at the projected $0.0006 launch price. But here’s the kicker—analysts see BTFD hitting a moonshot target of $0.006 in this bull cycle. That’s a 2900% ROI. Your same bag? It could balloon to $30,000. This is the kind of upside early DOGE and SHIBA believers now brag about. And that’s just the start. At the heart of this revolution is the Bulls Squad—a cast of characters that turns every token holder into part of a tight-knit mission. From Baby Bull to Nerdy Bull, this isn’t just branding—it’s identity. BTFD isn’t about aping trends, it’s about creating a tribe that plays to win.

DEGEN: Growing Buzz and Real Community Firepower While BTFD is dominating presale headlines, DEGEN is making waves in the broader market. Currently priced at $0.00229, DEGEN has seen a 5.35% daily jump, backed by a 24-hour trading volume of over $11.4 million and a market cap nearing $32.5 million. But this isn’t just hype—it’s backed by a vibrant, ever-expanding community born from the Farcaster Degen channel. DEGEN has gone from meme coin joke to ecosystem favorite, with its own Layer 3 blockchain and real dev engagement. With over 14.18 billion DEGEN in circulation, the project has nearly tapped its max supply—meaning early movers now have limited competition. For traders looking to ride the next sentiment spike, DEGEN’s current price window is one worth watching. PONKE: Maxed Supply and Meme Power on Solana Another token making headlines is PONKE, the offbeat meme project built on Solana. Priced at $0.0785, PONKE boasts a market cap of $43.6 million and nearly 100% of its supply already in circulation—555.54 million out of 555.56 million. That’s as close to fully diluted as it gets, making scarcity a huge part of the appeal. While PONKE doesn’t push traditional utility, its strong branding and cult following have made it a magnet for degen traders. Its status on Solana and the “no fluff, just vibes” approach to community keeps interest growing—even without staking or P2E rewards. It’s for those who want meme energy and volatility, with the bonus of a capped token supply. Final Word: These Meme Coins Could Make the Next Wave—But One’s Already Surging This market doesn’t wait for anyone—and the top new meme coins to join today are already drawing in the early believers. DEGEN is warming up with its growing ecosystem and user base, PONKE is riding high on near-zero dilution and maxed-out supply, but BTFD Coin is the real storm brewing. Based on recent data and analyst sentiment, the BTFD hype is not just noise. It’s backed by presale strength, product utility, and a cult-like community that’s built differently.

According to the SEC filing , the Canary Staked TRX ETF will track Tron (TRX) and enable investors to earn passively through the blockchain’s staking feature. The filing noted that CSC Delaware Trust will act as the trustee of the Canary Staked TRX ETF, while BitGo Trust Company will act as the custodian of the fund. Meanwhile, Canary Capital has yet to disclose the fund’s management fee and ticker, thus signing more filing amendments in the near future. Canary Capital Pushes for Crypto ETFs Canary Capital has heavily capitalized on the positive crypto regulatory outlook under the Donald Trump administration. As Coinpedia reported, Canary Capital has filed with the U.S. SEC to offer several spot ETFs. Canary Capital’s notable filings for spot ETF approvals include Sui (SUI), Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), Solana (SOL), XRP, and Hedera (HBAR). Impact on the TRX Market The filing of the Canary Staked TRX ETF is an indication of the rising demand for Tron coin among institutional investors. Moreover, the large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $22.8 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of around $464 million, has been signaling a potential upsurge after a bullish breakout. In the daily timeframe, TRX price has already formed a higher high and is currently attempting to establish a support level around 24 cents a consistent close above 24 cents and the 50-day Moving Average (MA) will fuel a bullish uproar towards 30 cents. Bigger Picture The Tron network has grown to a vibrant DeFi ecosystem, with more than $4.9 billion in total value locked and over $68 billion in stablecoins market cap. According to market data from Defillama, the Tron network recorded nearly 2.3 million active addresses in the past 24 hours, thus a chain revenue of around $1.82 million. The Tron network has gradually re-entered the United States market in the past few months after geoblocking during the Biden administration.",News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|TRX,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-18 22:34:48
43504329,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=150824,1745016002,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Crypto Alert: Binance Unleashes BANK/USDT Perpetual Contract with 50x Leverage,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/binance-launches-bank-usdt-contract/,"Get ready for another exciting opportunity in the crypto futures market! Binance, a leading global cryptocurrency exchange, has just dropped a bombshell announcement that’s sure to pique the interest of traders everywhere. They’re expanding their perpetual futures offerings with a brand new contract: BANK/USDT . This latest addition promises to bring increased trading possibilities and leverage for Binance users. Let’s dive into the details of this exciting launch and see what it means for you. What is the New Binance Futures BANK/USDT Perpetual Contract? Binance Futures is constantly evolving to provide its users with a diverse and dynamic trading environment. The introduction of the BANK/USDT perpetual contract is a testament to this commitment. Scheduled to go live on April 18th at 18:30 UTC , this new contract will allow traders to speculate on the price movements of the BANK token against USDT (Tether) without an expiration date. But what exactly does this mean for you as a trader? Perpetual Futures: Unlike traditional futures contracts that have an expiry date, perpetual futures contracts, like the new BANK/USDT offering, allow you to hold positions indefinitely. This means you can potentially profit from price movements over the long term without needing to worry about contract rollovers on a specific date. Trading Pair: BANK/USDT: This specific pair allows you to trade BANK, potentially the native token of a specific banking or financial project (further research into the specific BANK token is recommended before trading), against USDT, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. This pairing provides a direct and liquid market for trading BANK. Launch Date & Time: Mark your calendars! The BANK/USDT perpetual contract goes live on April 18th at 18:30 UTC. Be ready to jump in and explore the new trading opportunities as soon as it launches. Unlocking 50x Leverage in Crypto Leverage Trading One of the most significant features of the new BANK/USDT perpetual contract is the availability of up to 50x leverage . But what does leverage mean in the context of crypto leverage trading , and how can it impact your trading strategy? Leverage in trading is essentially using borrowed capital to increase your potential trading size. With 50x leverage, you can control a position worth 50 times your initial margin. While this can amplify your potential profits, it’s crucial to understand that it also magnifies your potential losses. Crypto leverage trading is a powerful tool, but it requires careful risk management and a solid understanding of market dynamics. Example of 50x Leverage: Let’s say you have $100 USDT and you want to trade the BANK/USDT perpetual contract with 50x leverage. Scenario Without Leverage With 50x Leverage Capital $100 USDT $100 USDT Position Size You Can Control $100 USDT $5,000 USDT (50 x $100) If BANK/USDT price increases by 1% Profit: $1 Profit: $50 If BANK/USDT price decreases by 1% Loss: $1 Loss: $50 As you can see, leverage can significantly increase both potential gains and losses. It’s vital to use leverage responsibly and within your risk tolerance, especially in the volatile cryptocurrency market. Proper risk management techniques, such as stop-loss orders, are highly recommended when engaging in crypto leverage trading . Multi-Asset Mode: Expanding Your Trading Flexibility Binance is also introducing multi-asset mode support for the BANK/USDT perpetual contract . This feature adds another layer of flexibility and convenience for traders. What does multi-asset mode mean, and how does it benefit you? Multi-asset mode allows you to use various cryptocurrencies as margin for your BANK/USDT perpetual contract trades. Traditionally, you would need to hold USDT in your futures wallet to trade USDT-margined contracts. However, with multi-asset mode, you might be able to use other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), or other supported assets as collateral. Benefits of Multi-Asset Mode: Increased Convenience: You don’t necessarily need to convert your crypto holdings to USDT before trading the BANK/USDT perpetual contract . If you already hold BTC or ETH, you might be able to use them directly as margin. Potential Margin Diversification: Using different assets as margin can potentially diversify your risk and margin requirements. Flexibility in Asset Utilization: Multi-asset mode gives you more flexibility in how you utilize your cryptocurrency holdings for trading. The specific assets supported in multi-asset mode for the BANK/USDT perpetual contract will be detailed by Binance upon launch. Traders should check the official Binance announcement or platform for the complete list of accepted margin assets. Futures Copy Trading: Learn and Potentially Profit from Experienced Traders For those who are newer to crypto leverage trading or looking to learn from experienced traders, Binance will also be enabling futures copy trading for the BANK/USDT perpetual contract within 24 hours of its launch. Futures copy trading is a powerful tool that allows you to automatically copy the trades of selected experienced traders. How Futures Copy Trading Works: Choose Traders to Follow: Binance’s futures copy trading platform will likely provide a list of experienced traders with their trading history, performance metrics, and risk scores. You can choose to follow traders who align with your trading style and risk tolerance. Allocate Funds: You decide how much capital you want to allocate to copy trading and which traders you want to follow. Automatic Trade Copying: Once set up, whenever the traders you follow execute a trade on the BANK/USDT perpetual contract (or other supported contracts), the same trade will be automatically executed in your account proportionally to your allocated funds. Benefits of Futures Copy Trading: Learn from Experienced Traders: Futures copy trading can be an excellent way for beginners to learn trading strategies and market analysis by observing and mirroring the actions of seasoned traders. Potentially Generate Passive Income: If you choose successful traders to follow, futures copy trading can potentially generate passive income without requiring constant monitoring and trading yourself. Time-Saving: For those who have limited time to dedicate to active trading, futures copy trading offers a hands-off approach to participate in the market. Important Considerations for Futures Copy Trading: Past Performance is Not Indicative of Future Results: While following successful traders can be beneficial, remember that past performance is not a guarantee of future profits. Market conditions can change, and even experienced traders can have losing streaks. Risk Management is Still Crucial: Even with futures copy trading , you still need to manage your risk. Carefully select traders to follow, understand their risk profiles, and consider using risk management tools like stop-loss orders on your copied trades. Do Your Own Research: Don’t blindly follow traders without understanding their strategies and risk levels. Do your own research and choose traders whose approaches align with your financial goals and risk tolerance. Conclusion: Embrace New Opportunities with Binance’s BANK/USDT Contract The launch of the BANK/USDT perpetual contract on Binance Futures presents a fresh and exciting opportunity for cryptocurrency traders. With up to 50x leverage, multi-asset mode , and upcoming futures copy trading functionality, Binance continues to innovate and expand its platform to meet the evolving needs of the crypto community. Whether you’re an experienced trader looking to capitalize on leverage or a newcomer eager to learn through copy trading, the BANK/USDT perpetual contract offers something for everyone.

Repeal of the SEC’s custody bulletin has drawn traditional finance back to bitcoin. Trump‑linked crypto ventures add another layer to market dynamics. Long‑term growth will hinge on the shape of new U.S. digital‑asset rules. In an April 17 interview with CNBC, CleanSpark CEO Zachary Bradford said President Donald Trump’s policies have been a ‘net positive’ for digital assets. He attributed the momentum to fresh institutional interest triggered by Congress’s repeal of SEC bulletin SAB 121 earlier this month. Trump’s Second Term Is A Net Positive, CleanSpark CEO Says “Since the administration took office, it’s been a net positive for our industry and a lot of this comes from the regulatory landscape,” Bradford told CNBC’s Talia Kaplan on Thursday . “In the prior years, you know the Bitcoin industry and the crypto industry as a whole, we had a lot of headwinds that we were facing,” Bradford continued. “We find ourselves with some tailwinds at this point.” The crypto entrepreneur pointed to the repeal of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) controversial bulletin, SAB121 – which required financial institutions custodying digital assets to list them as liabilities on their balance sheet – as having the “highest impact” for the crypto sector. SAB 121 being repealed may be the most important domino to fall for #Bitcoin under the new administration. It will now be easier for major financial institutions to participate in the future of finance. — Zach Bradford (@ZachKBradford) January 23, 2025 “As a result, there’s now more traditional institutions becoming interested in holding Bitcoin and interacting with it,” he added. Trump Sons Invest in New BTC Mining Operation Bradford’s comments come just weeks after crypto infrastructure firm Hut 8 announced that it would be launching Bitcoin mining firm American Bitcoin with investments from Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. American Bitcoin is here. Join us for the official launch presentation tomorrow, April 1 at 8:30 am ET to hear co-founder @EricTrump and the @Hut8Corp leadership team discuss our vision and strategy for the company. We will also be hosting a Space tomorrow at 3:00 pm ET (stay… pic.twitter.com/5FfyFWkAf9 — American Bitcoin (@AmericanBTC) March 31, 2025 When asked by Kaplan if he was “fazed” by the Trump-affiliated crypto company’s most recent announcement, Bradford reaffirmed that CleanSpark would “continue doing what we do best” as the Bitcoin miner “with the highest operational excellence in the industry.” “The scale we’re operating at will take a long time for anybody to catch up on,” he said. Whether Bradford’s vision materializes now hinges on the substance of America’s forthcoming crypto rulebook: clear guardrails could channel mainstream capital into Bitcoin mining and beyond, while prolonged regulatory drift risks eroding the very tailwinds he sees today. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What impact did SAB 121 have on financial institutions before its repeal? Government-held bitcoin from forfeitures is pooled into a non-selling reserve subject to audits and management guidelines. It diversifies assets without new spending but prompts concerns over liquidity and governance. What challenges remain for institutional crypto adoption despite recent rule changes? Even after SAB 121’s repeal, firms must address SAB 122 requirements, evolving SEC and CFTC roles, and secure custody systems. Regulatory gaps and varied state laws continue to complicate institutional entry. How do White House crypto policies influence mining operations and market sentiment? By issuing supportive orders and engaging regulators, the White House improved market outlook and helped miners secure capital for expansion. Yet, mining investment and sentiment remain sensitive to future policy clarity.

43504948,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=150826,1745017254,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin Dominance Soars to 64%: Alarming Sign for Altcoins or Crypto Market Revolution?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-dominance-crypto-market-2/,"The cryptocurrency market is buzzing with a significant shift: Bitcoin dominance is back in the spotlight, surging to levels not seen since the early days of 2021. This resurgence has sparked a wave of discussions and analyses across the crypto community. Is this a temporary blip, a sign of a new bull run focused solely on Bitcoin, or a potential threat to the broader altcoin ecosystem? Let’s delve into what’s driving this trend and what it could mean for your crypto portfolio. What Exactly is Bitcoin Dominance and Why Does it Matter? In simple terms, Bitcoin dominance refers to the ratio of Bitcoin’s market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies. A higher Bitcoin dominance percentage indicates that Bitcoin constitutes a larger portion of the overall crypto market value. Why is this important? Because it often serves as a barometer for the health and direction of the entire crypto market, and especially the relationship between Bitcoin and altcoins. Market Sentiment Indicator: Rising Bitcoin dominance can suggest a ‘flight to safety’ where investors are moving capital into the perceived stability of Bitcoin amidst market uncertainty. Altcoin Performance Gauge: Conversely, a declining Bitcoin dominance usually signals a growing interest and capital flow into altcoins, often during periods of broader market exuberance and higher risk appetite. Capital Rotation Insights: Monitoring Bitcoin dominance helps understand potential capital rotation trends within the crypto market – are funds flowing into Bitcoin or diversifying into altcoins? Bitcoin Dominance Analysis: Hitting Levels Unseen Since 2021 Recent data reveals that Bitcoin dominance has indeed reached 64%, a peak not experienced since early 2021. This significant climb, as highlighted by BeInCrypto, is raising eyebrows and prompting analysts to dissect the underlying factors. Let’s break down the key observations: Steady Uptrend: Excluding stablecoins from the calculation, Bitcoin dominance is even higher, nearing 69%. This indicates a consistent upward trend since late 2022, suggesting this isn’t just a short-term fluctuation. Potential Altcoin Pressure: Some analysts caution that if Bitcoin dominance surpasses the 66% mark, it could spell further trouble for altcoins. Historically, such levels have been associated with periods of significant altcoin underperformance. Stablecoin Dominance as a Counter-Signal?: Interestingly, some experts are also watching resistance zones in stablecoin dominance. A decrease in stablecoin dominance, coupled with rising Bitcoin dominance, might indicate capital rotation from stablecoins into Bitcoin, potentially signaling a more bullish outlook for Bitcoin itself. To put this in perspective, consider the following table illustrating historical Bitcoin dominance trends: Period Bitcoin Dominance (Approx.) Market Condition Early 2021 64% (Previous Peak) Early Bull Market Phase Mid-2021 ~40% (Local Bottom) Altcoin Season Peak Late 2022 ~39% (Recent Low) Bear Market Lows Present (Late 2023) 64% (Current High) Market Recovery/Uncertainty Is This an Alarming Sign for Altcoins? For altcoin holders, the surge in market dominance of Bitcoin might feel concerning. A consistently rising Bitcoin dominance can indeed indicate a period where altcoins underperform Bitcoin. Here’s why: Risk-Off Sentiment: In times of market uncertainty or fear, investors often gravitate towards Bitcoin as the oldest and most established cryptocurrency, reducing exposure to the perceived higher risk of altcoins. Liquidity Preference: Bitcoin boasts the highest liquidity in the crypto market. During downturns or corrections, traders and investors may prefer to hold Bitcoin for easier entry and exit points. Narrative Focus: Sometimes, market narratives shift to favor Bitcoin-specific developments (like ETF approvals, institutional adoption) diverting attention and capital away from altcoin narratives. However, it’s crucial to remember that the crypto market is dynamic. History shows that altcoin seasons often follow periods of Bitcoin dominance. A high Bitcoin dominance could be setting the stage for a future altcoin rally, as capital eventually rotates seeking higher growth potential in smaller cap cryptocurrencies. Crypto Market Revolution or Just a Phase? Understanding Capital Rotation The concept of capital rotation is vital for understanding market cycles in crypto. It describes the movement of investment capital between different asset classes or sectors within the crypto market. In the context of Bitcoin dominance, we often see a cyclical pattern: Bitcoin Accumulation Phase: Early stages of a bull market often see Bitcoin leading the charge, with investors initially focusing on the ‘blue-chip’ crypto. Bitcoin dominance tends to rise. Altcoin Speculation Phase: As the bull market matures, profits from Bitcoin may flow into altcoins, seeking higher percentage gains. This is often termed ‘altcoin season,’ and Bitcoin dominance may decline. Market Correction/Consolidation: During market corrections or bear markets, capital often flows back to Bitcoin and stablecoins for safety, increasing Bitcoin dominance again. Therefore, the current rise in Bitcoin dominance could be interpreted in multiple ways: Pre-Altcoin Season Setup?: It could be a necessary phase before another altcoin season. Bitcoin might be absorbing capital before a broader market rally encompassing altcoins. Flight to Quality Amidst Uncertainty?: It could reflect ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties or regulatory concerns pushing investors towards the relative safety of Bitcoin. Bitcoin-Specific Catalysts?: Developments like potential spot Bitcoin ETF approvals in the US could be driving increased demand specifically for Bitcoin, boosting its dominance. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Bitcoin Dominance Landscape So, what can crypto investors do amidst this rising Bitcoin dominance? Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Dominance Charts: Keep an eye on Bitcoin dominance charts and stablecoin dominance charts. These can provide early signals of potential shifts in market sentiment and capital flows. Diversify Strategically: Maintain a diversified portfolio, but consider adjusting allocations based on your risk tolerance and market outlook. During periods of high Bitcoin dominance, a slightly higher Bitcoin allocation might be prudent for some investors. Research Altcoin Fundamentals: If you are invested in altcoins, focus on projects with strong fundamentals, real-world use cases, and active development. These are more likely to weather periods of Bitcoin dominance and potentially outperform when altcoin interest returns. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with crypto news, Bitcoin analysis , and market trends. Understanding the narratives driving market movements is crucial for making informed investment decisions. Conclusion: The Evolving Narrative of Bitcoin Dominance Bitcoin’s surging market dominance to 64% is undoubtedly a significant development in the current crypto landscape. While it might raise concerns for altcoin enthusiasts in the short term, it’s essential to view it within the broader context of market cycles and capital rotation . Whether this marks the beginning of a Bitcoin-centric bull run or a prelude to another explosive altcoin season remains to be seen. For now, astute investors will be closely monitoring these trends, adapting their strategies, and preparing for the next exciting chapter in the ever-evolving crypto story. The market is constantly in flux, and understanding these shifts is key to navigating the world of digital assets successfully.

This guide delves into where these cryptocurrencies are headed in the coming months. Discover which ones are poised for growth and the crucial support levels to watch. Curious about the next big move? Dive into the analysis ahead. Hedera HBAR Dynamics: Short-Term Dips Amid Long-Term Surge and Key Levels Hedera price fell about 12% over the past month while climbing over 211% across six months. Volatility marked the recent decline, contrasting with a sustained rally that drove long-term gains. Sharp short-term corrections followed months of bullish buildup, showing the coin's ability for rapid movements and high potential. Recent setbacks provide opportunities for recovery. The coin now trades between $0.1166 and $0.2485, with resistance near $0.3343 and secondary resistance at $0.4662, while support holds around $0.0705 dollars. Mixed indicators, such as an RSI near 47 and slight momentum, suggest no clear trend, indicating both bulls and bears share control. Traders may explore breakouts above resistance or look for rebounds at support to guide decisions. VeChain Market Update: Recent Trends and Key Price Levels VeChain dropped 7.56% over the past month while showing a modest 5.02% rise over the last six months. A strong 14.58% one-week gain added a burst of energy during a period marked by mixed performance. Price swings revealed short-term strength amid longer-term caution, with movements varying as traders reacted to market shifts. Technical measures indicated a balance between upward pressure and correction across different time frames. Current trading lies between $0.01797 and $0.03102. A resistance level is near $0.03891 with clear support at $0.01282. Bulls have pushed prices higher in the short term, but recent monthly losses suggest caution. With no clear long-term trend, traders might consider buying near support and watching for a breakout above resistance. Ethena Trading: Bearish Trends and Key Levels to Watch Over the past month, Ethena dropped by nearly 24%, while a six-month decline reached around 30%. Price losses have accumulated gradually, with technical measures like a 41.35 RSI and a slightly negative Oscillator contributing to the downward pressure. This sustained decrease cautions investors against expecting an immediate recovery. Current levels set immediate support at $0.24 and resistance near $0.53, with secondary markers at $0.09 and $0.68. Bears dominate, as technical signals lean bearish, with no clear uptrend in sight. Trading strategies focus on cautious long entries near support, emphasizing mindful risk management in case of a breakout. Conclusion HBAR , VET , and ENA are currently at crucial support levels. These levels are important as they could influence price moves in the mid-term. Monitoring these points may offer insights into potential buying or selling opportunities. If these support levels hold, more positive price action might follow. Failing to hold could lead to further declines.

While Bitcoin (BTC) , Ethereum (ETH) , and XRP are picking up traction across all major exchanges, the market is also shifting its attention to early-stage plays with real breakout potential. One name that keeps dominating watchlists? MAGACOINFINANCE . MAGACOINFINANCE Is the Top Altcoin to Buy Before It Lists MAGACOINFINANCE is dominating early-stage crypto conversations with unmatched momentum, a capped supply of just 100 billion tokens , and explosive community support. Backed by a clear 25x ROI structure and the active MAGA50X bonus , it’s being called the best altcoin to buy before listings go live . This is the one project smart investors aren’t ignoring. FINAL CALL — ACT NOW & SECURE YOUR SPOT! XRP XRP has returned to form, gaining steam after positive regulatory developments. While it may deliver a 3x–4x in the long run, the climb is steady—not explosive. In contrast, MAGACOINFINANCE is engineered for speed , giving investors a real shot at outsized returns far quicker than traditional altcoins. Ethereum Ethereum (ETH) continues to lead in smart contract innovation and institutional adoption. However, its size limits ROI potential. Investors looking for rapid gains are now reallocating small-cap entries into MAGACOINFINANCE , which offers the kind of movement ETH once delivered in its earliest years. JOIN 12,500+ NOW — LIMITED TIME Bitcoin Bitcoin (BTC) holds its role as the market anchor, and rightly so. But its high entry point and slow returns make it ideal for preservation—not rapid growth. MAGACOINFINANCE, on the other hand, is trending in early-stage groups for its aggressive structure and built-in momentum , drawing eyes away from slow movers. Toncoin Toncoin (TON) is carving out a space in the social and messaging sector, but remains limited in broader adoption. Investors are noticing that MAGACOINFINANCE has better timing and more aggressive community engagement , leading to stronger FOMO and faster wallet growth. LINK Chainlink (LINK) has utility and trust, especially in oracle services. Yet it lacks excitement in the short term. MAGACOINFINANCE fills that void , bringing early-stage energy and ROI buzz that LINK simply no longer commands. 50% EXTRA BONUS LIVE — USE CODE MAGA50X BEFORE IT’S GONE! HBAR Hedera (HBAR) is quietly expanding through enterprise integrations, but lacks investor excitement. MAGACOINFINANCE, by contrast, is making noise —influencers, analysts, and Telegram communities are all aligned on its breakout potential this quarter. Conclusion BTC, ETH, and XRP are solid choices—but their growth is now measured. For investors seeking explosive ROI with real positioning before a listing , MAGACOINFINANCE offers what the majors no longer can . It’s trending, it’s accelerating, and it’s turning small entries into big plays.

But let’s be honest—many projects just couldn’t deliver. Some fizzled out in hype cycles. Others got stuck in scaling nightmares or failed integrations. Qubetics , Gala, and Immutable X are emerging as that rare class of next big crypto contenders. They’re not battling for likes—they’re solving concrete challenges. From enterprise-ready infrastructure to decentralized content ecosystems and NFT-powered gaming, these platforms are being discussed in developer circles for what they do, not what they might do. And among them, Qubetics is pulling focus like a magnet. What makes Qubetics ($TICS) stand out is its practical attack on problems that previous blockchains glossed over. While others obsessed over speed and speculation, Qubetics built a real-world toolkit, starting with its Decentralized VPN that can genuinely change how digital privacy, secure access, and cross-border operations work. And it’s not just gaining attention—it’s becoming the go-to solution for users who want more than promises and hype, demanding tools that actually deliver in real-world scenarios. Qubetics – Building Trust Through Decentralized Privacy Qubetics is engineered for those who demand real-world value from blockchain. Its flagship? A Decentralized VPN built to empower seamless, borderless, and censorship-resistant online access for enterprises, creators, and platforms that need airtight data protection. Picture this: A supply chain platform securely communicating with global partners without third-party surveillance. Or a DeFi protocol team working remotely across continents—sharing data, accessing private testnets, and safeguarding proprietary contracts using Qubetics’ VPN. Even cross-chain applications benefit by running privacy-sensitive nodes without leaving their security to chance. This isn’t wishful thinking—it’s already happening. Now let’s talk numbers. Qubetics is currently in Stage 30 of its crypto presale, priced at $0.1729 per $TICS token. More than 24,900 community members have already joined the movement. With over 508 million tokens sold and $16.2 million raised, Qubetics isn’t a future player—it’s already shaping the next wave. And projections? At $1, early participants could see a 478% ROI. At $15, that figure skyrockets to 8,568% ROI. That’s not speculation—that’s momentum you can quantify. What Happens If You Put $200 into Qubetics Right Now? With $200, you’d lock in 1,157 $TICS tokens at the current stage. Should $TICS hit $5, you’re staring at $5,785, and if it touches the $15 mark, you’re pocketing a mind-blowing $17,355. That’s wealth acceleration that legacy banks can’t offer. The early entries are winning already—don’t miss the train before it leaves the station, the next big crypto, and the best crypto presale for 2025. Gala – Rebuilding on Utility After the Dip Gala Games built its brand around decentralizing entertainment, especially in gaming and music. But the price rollercoaster hasn’t been gentle. From its high of $0.067 in 2024 to a current $0.01396 (as of April 18, 2025), Gala’s journey has tested the faith of its earliest supporters. But if technical indicators have any say, the tide may be turning. A falling wedge pattern is forming—a classic reversal sign. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) and RSI both suggest accumulation is underway. These aren’t memes—they’re momentum. And Gala’s pivot to a stable pricing mechanism for in-game stores (tied to a 3-day moving average) shows maturity. By insulating players and developers from extreme volatility, Gala is rebuilding trust one block at a time. The Gala Games ecosystem is also staying creative. While broader metaverse talk has cooled, Gala’s commitment to gaming-first utility means titles like GRIT and Spider Tanks continue drawing developer attention. This isn’t about speculation—it’s about experience. And that means Gala’s infrastructure and IP licensing could offer long-term appeal. Despite price drops, Gala’s ability to pivot and re-center on utility shows it’s still one of the next big crypto projects worth tracking. Immutable X – Powering NFTs Without the Gas Pain Immutable X isn’t just scaling Ethereum—it’s rewriting what NFTs can be. Powered by zk-rollups, it delivers gas-free minting, near-instant trades, and zero security trade-offs. For developers, that means frictionless deployment. For users, it means NFTs that don’t come with surprise charges or delayed confirmations. With a focus on gaming, Immutable X supports heavyweights like Gods Unchained, where item ownership isn’t just cosmetic—it’s integrated, transferable, and valuable. This L2 solution tackles Ethereum’s biggest headaches—scaling and cost—while keeping its security intact. No bridges, no compromises. IMX trades at $0.54. A short-term dip of 3.11% has some watching cautiously, but long-term metrics are solid. Partnerships with OpenSea, Mintable, and StarkWare have deepened its moat, and a broader shift toward utility NFTs in the metaverse plays directly to its strengths. Immutable X doesn’t just follow trends—it enables them. It’s a next big crypto for those who see NFTs as more than art—they’re infrastructure. Why These Three Are On Everyone’s Radar Qubetics, Gala, and Immutable X weren’t chosen for hype. Each one represents a different evolution in blockchain utility—whether it’s privacy-first infrastructure, decentralized gaming ecosystems, or NFT-powered ownership with zero gas costs. Qubetics leads with real-life use cases, like cross-border privacy and multi-chain deployment. Gala keeps betting on community engagement and developer loyalty through stable pricing and immersive entertainment. Immutable X is changing how Ethereum’s scalability problem is solved in the NFT realm. Together, they’re building an internet not just owned by users—but run on tools that work in the real world. Next big crypto is more than a phrase—it’s a call to action. Don’t sit idle watching others take the lead. This trio is gaining traction, and early participation often separates those who watch from those who win. Conclusion: The Blueprint for What’s Coming Next The crypto winter didn’t wipe out potential—it filtered out the noise. What’s left now are projects with staying power. Projects with actual working products, engaged communities, and real-world purpose. Qubetics is redefining digital privacy with a Decentralized VPN that isn’t theoretical—it’s operational. Gala is quietly correcting its trajectory with pricing innovations and real engagement strategies. Immutable X is already hosting some of the most innovative gaming and NFT projects in the space. When the next wave hits, these names will be riding high. Don’t just scroll past. Act, explore, and research further. The next big crypto wave is already forming—and it’s got utility at its core. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What makes Qubetics different from other new crypto projects? Qubetics combines interoperability with real-world solutions, like a decentralized VPN, making it a standout for utility-driven blockchain applications. Is Gala still a good project after its recent price drop? Yes, Gala Games has introduced stable pricing and technical indicators show a potential bullish reversal, indicating continued relevance in decentralized entertainment. Why is Immutable X considered a strong Layer 2 solution for NFTs? Its zk-rollup tech enables gas-free NFT transactions while preserving Ethereum’s security, making it ideal for developers and users in gaming and metaverse projects.

The latest wave of optimism was set in motion when Real Vision co‑founder Raoul Pal published an updated overlay of Bitcoin versus Global M2—an aggregate of every major country’s broad money supply converted to US‑dollar terms—and told followers, “It is time, give or take a few days.” Other accounts also shared similar charts. One asserted that Bitcoin “continues to mirror Global M2 with its classic 12‑week lag,” predicting “aggressive upside likely kicks off next week… $74.5 K looks like it was the bottom,” while other self-proclaimed crypto guru promised a new all‑time high “within weeks.” Bitcoin Vs. M2: Is A Price Explosion Really Coming? The viral charts drew immediate fire from TXMC (@TXMCtrades). In a lengthy thread he argued that computing a daily or even weekly Global M2 series is “goofy and frankly a scam” because “the United States is only updating M2 on a weekly basis and all others are monthly.” He continued: Related Reading: This Bitcoin Bear Confirmation Is Yet To Appear, Glassnode Reveals “You are looking at basically 30 out of 31 days of FX fluctuations with a static once‑monthly global aggregate multiplied behind it… China, USA, and Japan have even updated into March. The rest are still on February values during a time when the dollar has been tanking hard… You’re looking at an M2‑weighted inverse dollar exchange rate 95% of the time. Be better at math!” TXMC noted that China now accounts for roughly 46 percent of the putative Global M2 and is “the ONLY major country whose broad money supply is above its post‑covid peak in dollar terms,” a dynamic that “goes straight up” because Beijing is “trying to ease out of an ongoing multi‑year debt deflation.” By contrast, US M2 “is below its 2022 peak… and growing at the slowest pace since Bitcoin’s birth excluding 2022‑24 when it was negative y/y.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces Pressure As Report Flags Chinese Sell-Off Plans Beyond the cadence mismatch, he blasted the practice of applying “random #‑week offsets” to force a visual correlation between Global M2 and Bitcoin. “These charts are over‑fitted junk using extremely recent history as a thesis for why they should correlate,” he said, adding that while assets can be “directionally sympathetic on a monthly basis… the main critiques relate to presenting a daily/weekly metric using monthly data… AND using over‑fitted offsets of that data to try to forecast the future for a content audience.” The broadside prompted a rebuttal from YouTuber Colin Talks Crypto (@ColinTCrypto), who claimed that key central banks do in fact provide higher‑frequency figures. “China M2 updates daily—not monthly,” he wrote, attaching what he said were current charts through April 17 2025. “Japan’s M2 also updates daily… Since about half of your post relies on ‘China data being slow and outdated’… your post’s main argument weakens greatly at this point.” TXMC swiftly countered that assertion, insisting “there is no daily M2” and that any high‑frequency series is merely “a projection of a 1‑2 month old value using real‑time FX values.” The sudden April “pop” in Global M2, he maintained, is nothing more than the dollar’s sharp slide translated mechanically into larger dollar‑denominated money stocks. “Because Global M2 doesn’t actually exist, it is an abstraction of money that lives solely in a chart formula,” he wrote. “It treats all broad aggregates around the world as the same pool of eligible capital and introduces a heap of noise via foreign exchange rates… this is how the sausage is actually made and it’s not sexy.” At press time, BTC traded at $84,750.

His recent media appearances show a turn toward Republican support as part of his public strategy. He drafted personal notes outlining a public relations plan to reshape his image via conservative media channels. Convicted for orchestrating a vast fraud at a major cryptocurrency exchange, he faces a lengthy prison term and hefty restitution orders. On April 18, disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman‑Fried was transferred to the low‑security Federal Correctional Institution Terminal Island in Los Angeles—renowned for once housing Al Capone and Charles Manson—after a brief stay at a medium‑security facility in San Bernardino County. Sam Bankman‑Fried Moved to Los Angeles Prison According to data from the Federal Bureau of Prisons , Bankman-Fried is currently housed at Terminal Island Federal Correctional Facility (FCI), which previously held cult leader Charles Manson, crime boss Al Capone and former Theranos COO Ramesh Balwani. Bankman‑Fried was previously held at FCI Victorville , a prison in San Bernardino County that is known for being “violent” and “political.” Just last month, Bankman-Fried was held at the Federal Transfer Facility in Oklahoma City, OK, before ultimately being transported to his home state of California. Bankman-Fried’s shifting journey through federal prisons comes shortly after the one-time “king of crypto” gave a high‑profile interview behind bars to media personality Tucker Carlson. Going according to Sam's plan – ""Go on Tucker Carlson, come out as a republican"" pic.twitter.com/T5Zueo2QML — Coffeezilla (@coffeebreak_YT) March 7, 2025 SBF had previously drafted a Google Doc listing potential ways he could improve his public image after FTX’s collapse, including going on the misspelled “Tucker Carlsen” show and coming out as a Republican “against the woke agenda.” Some legal commentators contend that Bankman‑Fried’s recent right‑leaning messaging could be an attempt to position himself for a potential pardon from President Donald Trump. Bankman-Fried Behind Bars With $11B Restitution Order Bankman-Fried was convicted on multiple fraud charges in November 2023 for the dramatic crash of FTX after a month-long trial that saw numerous associates of the former crypto kingpin testify against him. “He knew it was wrong,” Judge Lewis A. Kaplan said during Bankman-Fried’s sentencing in March 2024. “He knew it was criminal. He regrets making a bad bet against the likelihood of getting caught—he’s not going to admit a thing.” SBF is currently serving a 25-year sentence and has been ordered to repay $11 billion for orchestrating the massive crypto scheme .

Since a 69,000‑tonne tanker from Corpus Christi, Texas, reached the south‑eastern province of Fujian on 6 February, no other U.S. LNG vessel has docked in China. A second ship bound for the mainland changed course to Bangladesh after failing to arrive before Beijing’s 15% tariff on American LNG took effect on 10 February. That duty has since risen to 49%, making the fuel uneconomical for Chinese buyers for the foreseeable future. The halt repeats a year‑long block on U.S. LNG during Donald Trump’s first term. Analysts say the latest stand‑off could have wider consequences, drawing China closer to Russian supplies and clouding the prospects of the multibillion‑dollar export terminals now being built in the United States and Mexico. “There will be long‑term consequences,” said Anne‑Sophie Corbeau, a natural‑gas specialist at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. “I do not think Chinese LNG importers will ever contract any new U.S. LNG.” China already takes only a small share of its LNG from the United States. After Russia’s full‑scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Chinese firms found it more profitable to resell U.S. cargoes to Europe. Last year, just 6% of China’s LNG imports came from American plants, down from 11% in 2021. Even so, Chinese groups, including PetroChina and Sinopec, hold 13 long‑term contracts for U.S. LNG running as far as 2049. Those off‑take agreements were crucial to financing new Gulf Coast projects, but developers have recently tried to renegotiate terms to reflect higher inflation and the burden of Chinese tariffs. Beijing is meanwhile turning to Moscow In the short term, few expect trade to resume. “The last time this happened, there was a complete hiatus until the Chinese authorities granted waivers to companies, but that was at a time when gas demand was booming,” said Gillian Boccara, an analyst at Kpler. “Now we are looking at lower economic growth, and we think the Chinese can withstand the loss of these cargoes for quite a long time.” China’s ambassador to Russia, Zhang Hanhui, said this week that Chinese buyers were eager to raise purchases of Russian LNG. “So many buyers are asking the embassy to help establish contacts with Russian suppliers, I think there will definitely be more [imports],” Zhang told reporters. Russia is already China’s third‑largest LNG supplier, behind Australia and Qatar, and the two governments are negotiating a second cross‑border gas pipeline, Power of Siberia 2. “With tariffs rising to the level where they are an effective embargo, we will see a reshuffling of trade flows,” said Richard Bronze of consultancy Energy Aspects. “We also expect Asia demand to fall by five to ten million tonnes as a whole. That should bring gas prices down a bit in Europe.” For now, the empty arrival logs at Chinese ports underline the practical impact of tariffs that turned U.S. LNG from a growth trade into a stranded cargo, while giving Russia another opening in Asia’s largest gas market.

TRUMP was last trading around $7.70, close to its lowest levels since its launch back in January. The Trump organization launched the official TRUMP coin just ahead of Trump’s inauguration in late January. Initial hype say the meme coin surge to a price of over $70 and a market cap in the $10s of billions. However, the meme coin has since reversed close to 90% lower. That’s partly because the TRUMP coin launch sucked a lot of liquidity out of the broader meme coin market, which has been in sharp decline since the token’s launch. It’s also because the macro backdrop has taken a substantial turn for the worse , with risk assets like stocks and crypto taking a beating from concerns about the economic fallout from Trump’s trade wars. But TRUMP coin’s price has also likely suffered from an intense amount of criticism, and concerns about potentially unfair tokenomics. Its sharp decline back from post-launch highs looks typical of a “pump-and-dump” scheme, a common type of scam in crypto, with many calling it out as such. Trump’s meme coin has to be the biggest scam of the season. pic.twitter.com/nCvNWgyVP1 — VolgaLad (@cym27s) April 13, 2025 Meanwhile, there are concerns that the tokenomic distribution of the meme coin is unfair, with the Trump organization having gifted themselves 80% of the token’s overall supply. These tokens have been vested to release over the next three years, with 4% of supply, worth around $300 million, unlocking on Friday. Despite having $300m in unlocks today and then unlocks every day after that the $TRUMP token is up on the day. pic.twitter.com/3qDI4qLREU — Chris (@ChrisCoffeeEth) April 18, 2025 Where Next for TRUMP Coin? Here’s What the Chart Says Fundamentals paint a difficult picture for TRUMP coin right now. In the absence of a major improvement in sentiment for the broader crypto market, the meme coin is unlikely to be going anywhere fast. Chart analysis also paints a bearish picture for TRUMP coin. TRUMP has continually found resistance at its 21DMA in recent months, and appears to be stuck in a downwards trend channel. If the current trend continues, TRUMP could fall to around $5 by the end of the month. A substantial rebound is likely overdue at this point, though, and if the meme coin were to break above its recent downtrend and 21DMA, a quick rally back above $10 would be likely. Still, as macroeconomic uncertainty remains high, any TRUMP rally is likely to remain short-lived and shallow. Savvy investors will be using the current high levels of uncertainty in the market, and suppressed crypto prices right now, as an opportunity to accumulate. However, concerns about the credibility of the TRUMP meme coin suggest it may not be the best crypto to buy now. Coins like Bitcoin , Ethereum and Solana are likely to see big gains before the end of Trump’s four-year term, and are much safer bets than TRUMP coin. That said, this is crypto, and Trump is the biggest name in the world. TRUMP coin could surprise everyone with a major comeback at any moment. Just as its fallen 90% from recent highs, a 10x rally to new record highs is also possible.

Ali Yahya, a general partner at a16z crypto, announced the investment in ZRO , the native token of the omnichain interoperability protocol LayerZero. LayerZero aims to move data across blockchains and support “censorship-resistant messages and permissionless development through immutable smart contracts.” Yahya notes the a16z investment has a three-year lockup. ZRO was trading around $2.33 prior to the announcement and surged to a high of $2.54 around 90 minutes later. The 208th-ranked crypto asset by market cap has since partially retraced to $2.46 at time of writing, though it remains up by more than 2.5% in the past 24 hours. The overall crypto market cap, by comparison, is down more than 1% in the past day. Earlier this week, the on-chain perpetual exchange GMX announced LayerZero would serve as the “preferred messaging infrastructure provider” for its multichain expansion. The XDC Network, a layer-1 blockchain, also recently announced a LayerZero omnichain integration. Explains XDC, “This integration connects the XDC Network to over 125+ LayerZero-supported blockchains, empowering developers and enterprises to build omnichain applications interacting across networks with enhanced trust, speed, and efficiency.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

SOL Technical Analysis reveals the price testing support, yet resistance near $120 still limits any major breakout. On the other hand, Dogecoin Price Today shows a drop to $0.1458, marking a 3% decrease. However, key indicators and increased whale activity indicate the move could be temporary. While charts keep traders busy, another segment is focusing elsewhere. BlockDAG (BDAG) continues gaining traction, not only for price performance but also for standout initiatives. Its upcoming Web3 learning program, the BlockDAG Academy, has sparked real interest among developers. With $215 million already secured and early backers seeing 2,380% returns, BDAG is becoming known as one of the best-performing cryptos in current circulation. SOL Technical Analysis: Resistance Holds as Price Struggles Recent data from SOL Technical Analysis shows a doji candlestick forming around the $94.83 level, hinting at a possible short-term rebound. The climb toward $111.78 came shortly after Janover made public their interest in acquiring SOL, reigniting curiosity in the asset. Still, the coin has found it tough to push through the $120 barrier, currently trading at $106.74. Analysts continue to debate whether this signals a solid reversal or just a classic fake-out rally. Adding to the outlook, Solana’s network strength stands out. DEX volumes topped $2.9 billion over the past month, and decentralized platforms like Orca and Pump are showing strong usage. If SOL fails to overcome resistance, the $80 support range may come into play next. Dogecoin Price Today: Market Pullback Triggers a Dip As of now, Dogecoin Price Today is pegged at $0.1458, falling 3% over the past day after a broader crypto correction tied to new U.S. tariff updates. Despite this decline, several technical signals still point toward active market engagement. Support levels remain intact below the $0.15 range, and both whale and mid-tier holdings are on the rise. Wallet addresses holding 10,000 DOGE or more have climbed to 240,000, up from 236,000 in just a short span. Though price sentiment looks uncertain, the MACD suggests a bullish crossover might be approaching. An upward trendline continues to provide backing, though the Directional Movement Index (DMI) hints at ongoing market indecision. BlockDAG Web3 Academy Prepares for Launch to Support Web3 Growth The spotlight on BlockDAG (BDAG) is brighter than ever, with its $215 million presale success and now the introduction of the Web3-focused BlockDAG Academy. Currently, BDAG is trading at $0.0248 in its 27th batch, having sold 19.2 billion coins since the presale began. Those who joined early have already seen a 2,380% return. Presented by blockchain expert Maurice Herlihy during Keynote 3 , the Academy is structured into three tiers: Elementary for starters, Intermediate for learning about smart contracts and decentralized governance, and Advanced for developers diving into APIs and dApp development. This initiative isn’t just another course; it’s a clear learning path meant for everyday users and advanced coders alike. With simplified material and practical modules, it aims to help users move from theory to hands-on implementation. As Herlihy put it, the Academy teaches more than basic navigation—it provides the reasoning behind the actions. With many searching for genuine learning opportunities in Web3, BlockDAG stands out by offering clarity and structure. The Academy is set to be the starting point for those aiming to gain real knowledge and apply it directly within the BlockDAG ecosystem. Final Words! SOL Technical Analysis continues to show strong network performance, but price progress is still limited by overhead resistance. Dogecoin Price Today reflects a minor pullback, yet accumulation patterns suggest an underlying strength. Neither asset has made a decisive move. Meanwhile, BlockDAG keeps growing in momentum. With a $215 million presale, over 2,380% in early returns, and a live rate of $0.0248, it remains one of the best-performing cryptos right now. The introduction of BlockDAG Academy is another bold step, capturing developer attention and making a strong case for BDAG’s continued rise in Web3.

After all, there were expectations that Cardano’s token would be included in a crypto strategic reserve. Hoskinson has shrugged off the snub, not seeing why it should bother him when he is not trying to enter their good books. Charles Hoskinson did not mind not getting invited to the crypto summit One of the biggest reasons why Hoskinson does not feel left out after not getting an invitation to the summit is that he is not going out of his way to foster a connection to the Trump administration. ”A lot of people want to get close to David Sacks and Bo Hines and build relationships there,” Hoskinson told DL News. “That’s the flavor of the week. It’s nice for optics, but it doesn’t translate into sustainable, permanent policy.” As far as the billionaire blockchain builder is concerned, he does not need to “make a deal with Trump,” and so spending time with him is not at the top of his list of priorities. These days, he has his hands filled with promoting blockchain technology — ie, Cardano — to lawmakers, regulators, and even the occasional head of state as a useful tool for government services. In a bid to win these people over, Hoskinson has become some sort of DeFi diplomat flying around the world to offer insight on forming what he calls sustainable, permanent policy for blockchain technology. He has even reportedly gotten close to Senator Tim Scott, the influential chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, who is shepherding the landmark stablecoin bill through Congress. Great dinner with Senator Scott. America's best days are coming pic.twitter.com/r8tXfzhDB9 — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) November 21, 2024 Hoskinson hopes the future of crypto will have stable regulatory laws Since Trump became president, he has signed an executive order to overhaul crypto policy, established a Bitcoin strategic reserve, and appointed Paul Atkins , a pro-crypto lawyer, to head the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It has taken the industry several steps forward but, Hoskinson is looking at the long game and hopes that when Trump’s time comes to an end, the changes he made will remain permanent fixtures in the emerging framework for the industry. He has been advocating for more stable regulatory laws and is currently monitoring a market structure bill that would establish clear regulatory authority by dividing up the responsibilities between the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ). Solidifying such measures into place is important, Hoskinson has said. “There will be a person after Trump, whether it be JD Vance or a Democrat or somebody else, it’s immaterial,” he stated. “I need a consistent, stable set of rules.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

On Friday, the firm filed an S-1 prospectus with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for a spot Tron ETF that would include staking capabilities. The new Canary Staked TRX ETF product seeks to provide Tron’s price exposure . Canary Capital expands ETF lineup with Tron filing Renowned for pioneering some of the most notable altcoin ETF products, this latest Tron ETF further solidifies the firm’s position at the forefront of the exchange-traded fund revolution. Canary Capital has yet to reveal the trading platform on which the product will trade; however, it confirms it will provide exposure to the price of Tron. Canary Capital plans to use Coindesk Indices’ pricing data to determine the product’s Net Asset Value (NAV). This latest filing comes barely a month after the asset manager filed for Pengu ETF with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Nashville, Tennessee-based Canary is also seeking approval for Sui and XRP ETFs, in addition to filings for Hedera (HBAR) and Polkadot (DOT), bringing its total number of altcoin ETF proposals to six. The spike in applications is part of a flurry of filings for ETFs tracking altcoins, resulting from last year’s successful debut of funds tracking Bitcoin and Ethereum’s performance, respectively. The 11 Bitcoin funds have gained over $35 billion in net inflows over 15 months. As the trust’s sponsor, Canary Capital Group LLC will oversee the ETF’s operations and manage its performance . CSC Delaware Trust Company is expected to act as the trustee. The company notes that this new product structure intends to offer investors regulated access to staking rewards and market exposure to one of the most popular proof-of-stake digital assets. Tron, trading as TRX and the ninth-biggest cryptocurrency with a $23 billion market capitalization, was trading at about $0.24, down more than 3% over the past 24 hours. TRX has risen roughly 120% during the past year. The coin runs on its own blockchain and aims to build a decentralized internet controlled and owned by the individuals who use it. New SEC leadership hopes for altcoin ETF approvals by mid-2025 Industry optimism remains high despite the SEC’s ongoing delays in ruling on several altcoin ETF proposals. Other asset managers, including BlackRock, Bitwise, 21Shares, Franklin Templeton, and VanEck, are on the list of major fund issuers seeking an SEC green light for proposed ETFs. The companies have now filed applications for ETFs based on Solana (SOL), XRP, Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Litecoin (LTC). Industry analysts have said that XRP and Solana ETFs will likely receive approval next. Earlier this year, Bloomberg analysts forecasted a 90% chance of a Litecoin ETF gaining approval in 2025, citing its classification as a commodity and its structural resemblance to Bitcoin. The recent appointment of Paul Atkins as the new SEC Chair is also expected to boost the prospects for crypto ETF approvals. Alongside commissioners Mark Uyeda and Hester Peirce—both industry-friendly—Atkins is viewed as a positive force for the sector. With the change in leadership, experts anticipate that the SEC could greenlight multiple altcoin ETFs by mid-2025. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

ADA broke above a short-term downtrend around one week ago and if it can also break above its 21DMA, a bounce to its 200DMA in the $0.70s is likely. However, in the grand scheme of things, ADA remains stuck well within its recent multi-month $0.50-$1.20ish range. And the outlook for a major breakout above this range isn’t looking great right now. That’s principally because 1) risk appetite in the broader market remains poor and 2) a flood of new liquidity is unlikely to materialize anytime soon. Whilst ardently pro-crypto, the Trump administration is intent on pursuing economic policies (namely tariffs) that are likely to harm the US economy in the short-term, whilst also pushing up inflation. The prospect of weaker growth is hurting risk assets like stocks and crypto. The fact that Fed policymakers, namely the Fed chair Jerome Powell , are reluctant to cut interest rates due to fears about sticky inflation are making things worse. Jerome Powell could lower rates and boost the economy but refuses Is it time to end the FED? pic.twitter.com/iRKTkWk8mZ — TaraBull (@TaraBull808) April 18, 2025 Altcoin seasons that have benefitted the Cardano price in the past have typically come at times of mass liquidity injection from the Fed. But a new flood of liquidity is unlikely to come anytime soon, so major altcoins like Cardano are set to continue to struggle. What Needs to Happen for a 400% Cardano Price Rally? If the US economy tilts into recession later this year and the Fed doesn’t respond as aggressively as the market hopes, that could be a recipe for substantially lower crypto price in the coming months. The Cardano price could easily slip back to test its mid-2024 levels around $0.30. For a major rally to send the price surging back towards record highs above $3.0 per token, a few things will need to happen. Firstly, the economy will likely need to be coming through the other end of any recession. That would allow risk appetite in the broader market to pick up. But for altcoin season to really get going, major easing from the Fed would be required. If the Fed is pumping the market full of QE again, this would be the signal for the potential arrival of a new altcoin season. Under such circumstances, a 400% rally back to record highs for ADA would be very possible. In fact, Cardano could even go further than that before the end of Trump’s four-year term. The Trump administration and current Congress are massively pro-crypto, with both pushing regulatory policies/legislation designed to bolster growth in the industry. “Cardano is a ghost chain with nothing going for it” Cardano: pic.twitter.com/88KDoqM5mB — Dawson Allen (@ddawsoncrypto) September 26, 2024 That should lift all boats, including the Cardano price. That said, Cardano lack’s substantial adoption compared to some of its closest rivals like Solana and Ethereum . Cardano Alternative to Consider – Solaxy (SOLX) Given its high level of adoption and developer activity, Solana is likely to extend its lead over Cardano in the coming years. That’s probably going to be reflected in better SOL price performance, too when compared to ADA. Those confident in Solana’s outlook would do well to accumulate SOL during the current market dip. However, it might also be a good idea for Solana investors to add highly promising Solana projects like Solaxy (SOLX) to their portfolios as well, given the prospect of even higher gains. Solaxy (SOLX), a pioneering Layer-2 solution for the Solana blockchain, addresses critical network congestion and scalability issues, enhancing transaction speed and reliability. By processing transactions off-chain and settling on Solana’s mainnet, Solaxy ensures low fees and high throughput, supporting applications like meme coin trading.

Factors such as increased adoption, community support, and favorable market conditions contribute to this optimistic outlook. Phase 4 of the MUTM presale is now live, sparking optimism among investors. With over $6.9 million raised and 8400 holders already on board, new investors are snapping up MUTM tokens at the current price of $0.025, knowing that the price will rise to $0.03 in Phase 5. Current participants have the potential to earn a 140% return on investment before the official project launch at $0.06. While DOGE aims for a substantial price increase, MUTM’s innovative approach and early-stage momentum suggest it could offer even more significant returns for investors seeking high-growth opportunities. Mutuum Finance Presale Surges as Investor Interest Grows Mutuum Finance has emerged as one of the rapidly rising top decentralized lending platforms thanks to its distinctive dual lending structure which attracts extensive investor interest. The project’s presale has attracted more than 8,400 investors who contributed $6.9 million to its success scale. During Phase 4 MUTM tokens offer a price of $0.025 yet investors can anticipate 20% profit growth from Phase 5’s price increase. Multiple analysts assure that MUTM represents a DeFi platform of low value because it will reach over $5 in market capitalization upon launching. MUTM provides investors with stable investment opportunities unlike the volatile nature of meme coins. Investors seeking returns from DeFi operations will find MUTM attractive due to its distinctive lending mechanisms along with a dynamic top-50 leader leaderboard system that provides benefits to loyal users. DeFi Experiences a Game-Changing Shift Mutuum Finance creates an innovative DeFi platform that combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models into one unified system. Users can generate passive earnings through the P2C model by providing USDT liquidity with automatic functionality supported by smart contracts. Users have the ability to make direct transactions through the P2P model which eliminates the requirement for intermediaries. Mutuum Finance integrates its P2C and P2P systems to create an attractive decentralized finance solution which enhances user security and operational efficiency and decentralization for investors searching for profits in the DeFi sector. Creating Stability and Security in DeFi Mutuum Finance provides a USD-backed stablecoin operated on Ethereum as a long-term asset solution. Through the implementation of over-collateralization the platform maintains lower risks than conventional algorithmic stablecoins do. Open-source smart contracts coupled with regular audits alongside this method establishes investor trust by preventing the security weaknesses detected in former DeFi projects. Mutuum Finance implements the $100,000 giveaway to support growth through which ten lucky winners receive $10,000 in MUTM tokens. Users who refer new investors to the ecosystem through the platform earn rewarding benefits from the built-in referral system. The first participants to join Mutuum Finance gain special access to staking opportunities as well as governance powers along with priority updates which keeps them deeply involved in the project’s advancement. Sustainable Tokenomics for Future Growth Mutuum Finance’s tokenomics strategy integrates limited token supply and deflationary elements to create scarcity, driving future value appreciation. By offering staking rewards, the platform incentivizes users to lock in their tokens, which helps support the token’s value as the project progresses. This approach ensures long-term growth and stability for both the platform and its investors, making MUTM a strong performer in the DeFi market. Dogecoin (DOGE) could hit $1 in 2025, but experts say the real moonshot might be Ethereum-based Mutuum Finance (MUTM), currently in Phase 4 of its presale at $0.025. With over $6.9 million raised, 8,400+ investors onboard, and a projected launch price of $0.06, early buyers could lock in a 140% return pre-launch and possibly up to 15,880% if price targets of $5+ are hit post-launch. Don’t wait, join the presale now to secure your position before Phase 5 kicks in and prices rise.

The premier cryptocurrency appears primed for positive movement in 2025, despite lingering macroeconomic uncertainty. Bitcoin Looks Ready To Reverse Trend In a Quicktake post, CryptoQuant contributor Crypto Dan highlighted that BTC is currently undergoing a correction phase similar to the one observed in 2024. The analyst noted that the amount of BTC held for less than one week to one month can serve as an indicator of how “overheated” the crypto market is. Related Reading: Bitcoin Following Gold’s Footsteps? Analyst Sets Mid-Term Target At $155,000 For context, in markets with high speculative activity – such as crypto – price pullbacks tend to be significant. In contrast, markets with lower speculation, like gold, typically experience shallower corrections. Crypto Dan shared the following chart showing three major phases of the crypto market – a market rally (red arrow), an increase in the ratio of BTC held for less than one week to one month (green pattern), and a subsequent correction (yellow arrow). He explained that this pattern has played out twice during the current bull market, with both instances showing similarly elevated levels of short-term BTC holdings, suggesting a comparable degree of market overheating. This ratio has now reached a cycle low, highlighted in the yellow-box region of the chart. Notably, this same region also marked the bottom of the 2024 market cycle. If the pattern mirrors its behaviour from 2024, it could indicate that the current cycle has also bottomed out. Crypto Dan explained: In other words, the overheating is now resolved, and although we may need to wait a little longer, with the progress of macroeconomic issues, 2025 is likely to show a positive movement. Adding to the optimism, a separate post on X by crypto analyst Titan of Crypto also points to a possible shift in momentum. The analyst noted that BTC recently formed a golden cross on the daily chart – a bullish signal that often suggests a trend reversal is underway. For the uninitiated, a golden cross occurs when Bitcoin’s 50-day moving average crosses above its 200-day moving average, signalling a potential long-term bullish trend. It’s widely seen as a buy signal by traders, indicating growing upward momentum. BTC Futures Sentiment Index Signals Caution Despite these bullish signals, not all analysts are convinced. Fellow CryptoQuant contributor abramchart recently observed that BTC’s futures sentiment index has continued to decline since February, suggesting a more cautious outlook among derivatives traders.

Adding to the leading digital asset’s woes, a recent report suggested that China may be preparing to sell a large amount of confiscated BTC, which may increase selling pressure and potentially suppress prices in the short term. At press time, BTC trades at $84,766, down 0.1% in the past 24 hours.

A leading crypto analyst has identified multiple bullish catalysts that could drive ADA’s momentum and help propel the cryptocurrency to this bullish target. Institutional Interest To Fuel Cardano Price Recovery According to a recent technical analysis by a pseudonymous TradingView analyst, ‘Risk_Adj_Return,’ the Cardano price is suddenly showing signs of recovery after a period of sluggish performance. This seemingly bullish turnaround has sparked predictions of a potential surge to $1.7. Related Reading: Cardano Price Prediction: ADA Set To Crash To $0.4 After Correction To Liquidity Zone According to the analyst’s report, several factors have been fueling ADA’s recovery. Despite its downtrend, large spot purchases have been observed, hinting at growing interest from institutional investors. The analyst also mentioned that political developments from key figures, such as US President Donald Trump, could spark further bullish sentiment for Cardano. Although many of the present institutional buy-ins for Cardano have been followed by sell-offs, possibly from short-term traders, the sheer volume suggests that major players are closely watching the market. Part of this renewed institutional interest is attributed to the US Federal Reserve (FED) and broader macroeconomic signals. Investors may be hoping for a shift in monetary policy or clear signs of easing inflation in the upcoming FOMC meeting, as this could boost risk assets like ADA. Any alignment between the Cardano price action and the FED decision could become a significant catalyst for upside momentum. In his Cardano price chart, the TradingView analyst highlighted a bullish long trade setup on the 4-hour timeframe, utilizing the Heikin-Ashi candles. The trading strategy is supported by multiple take-profit levels, with the entry point marked near Cardano’s current price range. A clear stop loss has also been placed just below the local support to manage downside risks. The trade plan involves three key take-profit levels: $0.73, $0.96, and $1.21. These targets align with previous resistance zones, allowing traders to potentially lock in gains before ADA reaches its ultimate upside target of $1.74. ADA Breakout Unlikely Amid US Trade Tensions The Cardano price is showing signs of strength, according to a market expert, ‘AMCrypto’, who notes that it is holding firm at a critical ascending support trendline on the 4-hour chart. After a recent decline, ADA bounced off the trendline, maintaining the bullish structure of an Ascending Triangle. Related Reading: Cardano Price Could Be Set For 100% Rally As This Bullish Triangle Has Formed On The Daily Timeframe Currently trading around $0.61, Cardano still faces resistance at $0.67. A confirmed close above this threshold could signal a breakout, potentially propelling its price toward the $0.73 – $0.75 range. However, despite these bullish technicals, macroeconomic uncertainty remains a key obstacle to ADA’s breakout potential. The ongoing US-China trade war tensions continue to fuel market volatility, creating headwinds for a sustained rally. The current market decline and instability fueled by this trade war have also kept many investors on the sidelines as they await stability.

The initial rollout will see millions of users—called Pioneers—transition to the open network. The plan also introduces new incentives, including referral bonuses for verified users. However, the network did not provide any anticipated dates or timelines . This has annoyed and startled many initial supporters. According to the roadmap, migration will take place in three key phases. First, Pi’s initial migrations will be done. This includes confirmed mining rewards, security circle rewards, lockup bonuses, app usage bonuses, and confirmed Node rewards for some. Secondly, it will implement referral mining rewards. But only if the referrals have undergone KYC (Know Your Customer) checks. The second phase will be initiated once the migration queue of the current version of Kin drives is completed. At last, Pi will initiate periodic migrations on a continuous time scale. The team says this could be once a month or once a quarter. But once again, no specific timetable was provided. Community flags gaps and raises concerns Several missing details have many Pioneers concerned. According to reports, some node operators have received rewards. But it remains unclear whom those payments are for and why. Without fair rules, early Node runners worry they might lose out. Meanwhile, some users have been dutifully clicking their “claim” button daily but have been surprised not to see their coins. They are wondering when base rewards and referral bonuses will finally come in. The user interface is a concern as well. The roadmap concedes that its “Transferable Balance” figure could be less than the actual amount. This has left many of the Pioneers fearing their real Pi coins are merely hidden or postponed. The network offers customers no visible solution to correcting mistakes if they find mistakes in their mining records, adding to the concern. Conflicts after six years of mining operations will certainly occur, but the roadmap does not indicate how those problems can be solved. Users push for answers amid ongoing uncertainty While the plan is well structured, the lack of specific timelines has worried some Pioneers. Adding to the uncertainty is a lack of clarity on how many users are currently in line to migrate and the network’s daily migration capacity. ​ Moreover, the roadmap admits that the UI’s “Transferable Balance” underestimates migrated amounts to save resources. Users fear this pessimistic display could erode trust if their true balances remain hidden. A frustrated community member questioned whether Pi Network ever had a real blockchain, saying they had believed they were mining PI coins and that the Security Circles formed the consensus mechanism. Still, now it seemed to them that there was no blockchain at all, and they wondered what kind of blockchain protocol would require all tokens to be minted at Genesis.​ The timing also fails to consider how many token unlock events will be aligned with migration waves — e.g., the approximately 108.9 million PI tokens unlocked this month. A handful of Pioneers have raised eyebrows about the project’s foundational narrative, suggesting that Pi’s claim that “all tokens were minted at genesis” runs counter to six years of “mining.” This mismatch questions whether Pi ever ran on an actual blockchain protocol.

While headlines are glued to Bitcoin’s political entanglements and Stellar’s real-world asset moves, there’s a silent disruptor that’s quietly building the very infrastructure both might need in the next chapter—Qubetics. The crypto market isn’t just looking for price action anymore. It’s demanding platforms that deliver something usable, scalable, and dependable for real-life problems. Qubetics ($TICS) is not playing catch-up—it’s building the tracks for a new kind of cross-chain financial reality. Unlike first-gen assets stuck in single-lane frameworks, Qubetics is enabling multi-chain transactions through its Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet. It’s designed to give full control to users, with zero centralized custody and full interoperability across blockchains. Real-life use cases? Countless. From small businesses handling invoices across borders to large firms syncing loyalty tokens across different chain ecosystems—this tech is built for those ready to move past theoretical models and into operational utility. That’s why many now consider it the next best crypto to buy before demand hits critical mass. Qubetics ($TICS): Redefining Blockchain Utility Through Multi-Chain Access Qubetics is laying the groundwork for what decentralized finance should’ve been from day one: fully interoperable, non-custodial, and accessible to anyone, regardless of the chain they use. The highlight here is the Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet, which lets users send, store, and swap tokens across different blockchains without giving up control or relying on custodians. Imagine a logistics firm syncing supply chain tokens between Ethereum and Avalanche without going through clunky bridges. Or an e-commerce store managing rewards tokens issued on Polygon and SUI, right from one dashboard. That’s what Qubetics unlocks. Users stay in control, and transactions stay on-chain without permissioned bottlenecks. And the traction is real. Qubetics is now in Stage 30 of its crypto presale , with a current price of $0.1729. Over 508 million $TICS tokens have been acquired by 24,900+ community members, and the presale has already surpassed $16.2 million. For many early participants, this might already feel like a ticket to the frontline of the next best crypto to buy. Unlike hype-driven coins, Qubetics is engineered around tools that plug directly into business processes and financial ecosystems. What Happens If You Put $100 into Qubetics Right Now? At the current presale price of $0.1729, a $100 investment fetches 578 $TICS tokens. If $TICS hits just $1, you’re looking at $578, a 478% return. If it explodes to $10—a target some analysts say isn’t far-fetched in this altcoin run—your $100 would skyrocket into $5,780. For just $100, you could turn passive capital into serious money. That’s the kind of upside that doesn’t come knocking twice. Bitcoin (BTC): Still the Standard, But Under New Political Pressure Bitcoin remains the digital gold, but now it’s also becoming a geopolitical chess piece. As of March 2025, the U.S. has launched a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, holding seized BTC assets indefinitely to back digital dominance. That bold move sparked strong reactions worldwide, with the European Central Bank warning of sovereignty risks and nations like Belarus expanding mining efforts in response. While the political side unfolds, price action reflects the tension. After peaking at $105,000 in January, Bitcoin dipped below $85,000 in March. Despite volatility, institutions are buying heavily. Goldman Sachs holds over $1.5 billion in Bitcoin ETFs, JPMorgan holds over $500,000, and BlackRock’s IBIT crossed $20 billion. Altogether, ETF inflows have hit $55 billion, shrinking the liquid supply and reinforcing Bitcoin’s status. Still, the problem remains: Bitcoin doesn’t do interoperability. It’s the store of value, yes, but not the infrastructure for flexible on-chain interactions. As new entrants demand usability alongside store-of-value strength, BTC might no longer be the next best crypto to buy, but rather the old guard to hold. Stellar (XLM): Tokenizing Finance With Institutional Strength Stellar is on a mission to bridge traditional finance and blockchain through real-world asset tokenization. In 2025 alone, it plans to tokenize over $3 billion worth of real-world assets, aiming to facilitate over $110 billion in volume. This isn’t a far-off goal—it’s already happening. Franklin Templeton recently launched a fully tokenized U.S. Treasury fund on Stellar. Taurus, a Deutsche Bank-backed provider, integrated Stellar into its custody platform. And Ondo Finance rolled out USDY, an income-generating stablecoin, using Stellar’s infrastructure. These moves reflect institutional confidence and growing on-chain utility. Stellar’s metrics back it up. With 9+ million active addresses, $458 million in tokenized RWAs, $4.1 billion in quarterly payment volume, and over 5.57 million daily operations, the network is proving its scale and throughput. But while Stellar excels in focused financial tokenization, it lacks the full cross-chain operability that defines the next best crypto to buy in today’s multi-chain age. Why These Three Matter in 2025 Qubetics, Bitcoin, and Stellar aren’t just tech stacks—they’re directions. Qubetics points forward, offering modular tools and multi-chain access for a decentralized future that actually works for real use cases. Bitcoin remains the reserve asset that every institutional fund wants exposure to, while Stellar has become the bridge connecting off-chain institutions to on-chain systems. Yet among them, only Qubetics is building tools that simplify blockchain use for the average business or application. It isn’t locked to one chain, and it doesn’t require permissioned entry points. It’s a decentralized infrastructure built to work anywhere, and that’s exactly the kind of thing that makes it the next best crypto to buy before it exits presale and enters the open market. Conclusion: One Is Solving the Problem, Two Are Setting the Stage The market is shifting. Those chasing hype are being outpaced by projects delivering tools that solve structural inefficiencies. Bitcoin is still a symbol of value and financial rebellion. Stellar is giving real-world institutions access to tokenization. But Qubetics? It’s equipping blockchain with tools that could finally make multi-chain functionality a standard, not a privilege. It’s no longer just about holding coins—it’s about choosing tools that’ll be indispensable when the next digital economy cycle begins. The next best crypto to buy is the one building the rails, not just riding the waves. And that makes Qubetics a front-runner worth a deep dive today. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What makes Qubetics a strong contender as the next best crypto to buy in 2025? Qubetics offers a Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet that enables seamless, cross-chain asset handling without centralization—solving a real gap in the crypto infrastructure. How is Stellar being used for real-world applications in 2025? Stellar is facilitating real-world asset tokenization with backing from major institutions like Franklin Templeton and Deutsche Bank-backed Taurus. Why is Bitcoin still relevant despite its limitations? Bitcoin remains a global store of value with growing institutional backing, especially after the U.S. introduced a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in 2025.

At the time of writing, the asset is trading at $84,596, down 0.1% in the last 24 hours. This places BTC approximately 22% below its all-time high of over $109,000 set earlier this year. The price action follows a recovery from earlier lows but remains range-bound, suggesting hesitancy among investors as macroeconomic uncertainties persist. One of the emerging observations comes from CryptoQuant analyst Crypto Dan, who compared Bitcoin’s current behavior to past correction cycles. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Still Close To Extreme Fear—Green Sign For Recovery? Speculation Eases, Setting the Stage for Potential Recovery In Dan’s recent QuickTake post titled “Cryptocurrency Market, Similar to the 2024 Correction Period,” Dan assessed the speculative dynamics of the market through the lens of short-term holder activity. His analysis suggests that the recent cooling-off period might mirror patterns observed during last year’s correction phase. According to Dan, one reliable gauge of market overheating is the percentage of Bitcoin supply held for one week to one month. When this metric rises, it often signals speculative enthusiasm, which can precede corrections. During previous bullish phases, such increases in short-term holdings were followed by pullbacks, marking peaks in investor exuberance. In the current cycle, Dan notes that this metric has once again reached a region previously associated with market bottoms—the same yellow box (on the chart shared) that aligned with the 2024 correction low. Based on this, he posits that speculative excesses have largely subsided, opening the door to renewed price growth if macroeconomic conditions continue to improve. However, he also emphasized that further consolidation may still occur before a broader trend shift materializes. Crypto Market, Similar to the 2024 Correction “Given that this ratio has now reached the yellow-box region, which was the bottom of the 2024 correction period, it seems likely that the current market will follow a similar path as the 2024 correction.” – By @DanCoinInvestor pic.twitter.com/YGNZxQnUXj — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) April 18, 2025 Bitcoin Whale Activity Suggests Imminent Volatility Complementing this analysis, CryptoQuant contributor Mignolet pointed out a notable shift in coin movement behavior. In a separate post, he observed that around 170,000 BTC recently moved from the 3–6 month holding cohort. This group typically includes mid-term holders, and substantial activity from them has historically preceded increased price volatility. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Futures Sentiment Weakens, Is The Ongoing Recovery Running Out of Steam? Mignolet illustrated his findings with data, noting that such movements have often signaled major price action, both upward and downward. Green box indicators on his chart marked rallies, while red boxes highlighted periods of decline. While the direction remains uncertain, he highlighted that the increased activity is an early warning sign that traders should be alert for a breakout or breakdown in the near future.

Top analysts believe that three coins are poised to lead the charge: Bitcoin (BTC) , Solana (SOL) , and XRP .

Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL) Projected to deliver a solid 2x–3x return based on institutional interest and market recovery. It remains a secure, long-term hold, but it’s unlikely to offer the exponential growth it once did. Solana (SOL) c ould produce 4x returns in 2025 as it regains strength across Layer 1 infrastructure. It’s a fast mover, and investors still believe in its roadmap. XRP Reenergized by legal clarity, may see a 5x return if its utility continues to expand in cross-border payments. It’s considered undervalued by many, and it’s gaining steam again. TON , XLM , and AVAX Also in the mix, each showing strong momentum and potential 4x–6x growth windows, but their upside remains more conservative compared to earlier cycles. 50% BONUS TOKEN OFFER — ENDS SOON!

But for investors with an appetite for growth and timing on their side, MAGACOINFINANCE offers the clearest path to 25x returns and beyond . It’s early. It’s gaining momentum.

Here’s whether the other cohorts have followed in the footsteps of these titans or not. Mid-Sized Bitcoin Holders May Finally Be Showing A Shift In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has discussed about the how the Accumulation Trend Score has looked for the various cohorts in the Bitcoin market. The “Accumulation Trend Score” is an indicator that tells us about whether the Bitcoin investors are participating in buying or selling. The metric checks not only the balance changes happening in the wallets of the holders, but also the size of the holdings themselves. This means that the indicator puts a higher weightage on the changes taking place that involve the large investors. When the metric has a value greater than 0.5, it means the large addresses (or a large number of small entities) are participating in accumulation. The closer the metric gets to the 1 mark, the stronger this behavior becomes. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Bear Confirmation Is Yet To Appear, Glassnode Reveals On the other hand, the indictor being under 0.5 implies the holders are taking part in distribution, or simply not doing any accumulation. Here, the extreme point lies at the 0 level. In the context of the current topic, the Accumulation Trend Score of the entire sector isn’t of interest, but rather that of each investor cohort separately. There are different ways to classify holders, but the relevant one here is on the basis of wallet size. Below is the chart for the indicator shared by the analytics firm that shows how the behavior has changed for the Bitcoin holder groups over the past year. As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin Accumulation Trend Score took a bright red shade for all cohorts back in February, indicating market-wide strong distribution. Since this selloff, the indicator’s value has gone up for the various cohorts, implying a cooldown of selling pressure has occurred. This cooldown has varied across the groups, however, with one cohort in particular diverging far away from the rest: the 10,000+ BTC holders. Popularly, the investors carrying between 1,000 to 10,000 BTC are known a the whales, so these holders, who are even more humongous, could be termed the “mega whales.” From the chart, it’s apparent that this group took to buying in March and has since seen its accumulation deepen as the Bitcoin Accumulation Trend Score has reached a value of around 0.7. The rest of the market has also been easing up its distribution in this period, but none of them have moved into the accumulation territory yet. That said, the 10 to 100 BTC investors are close, with the score now sitting at 0.5 for them. “This suggests at a possible shift in sentiment from mid-sized holders,” notes Glassnode. Related Reading: Bitcoin Realized Cap Sets New Record, But Momentum Fades It now remains to be seen whether the trend of increase in the indicator would continue in the coming days and the rest of the Bitcoin cohorts would catch up with the mega whales or not.

Bitcoin’s 24/7 trading bolsters volatility when TradFi “freaking out” However, she said that a “massive liquidity unlock” could be the catalyst needed for Bitcoin ( BTC ) to reach more optimistic targets, similar to those before the tariffs were introduced. For example, if the US bond market “broke” and the US Federal Reserve had to step in with measures like yield curve control or heavy quantitative easing (QE), Alden explained. Lyn Alden spoke to Coin Stories’ host Natalie Brunell on April 17. Source: Natalie Brunell While Alden said that there is a “good chance” Bitcoin reclaims the $100,000 price level before the end of the year, she emphasized that broader financial market “down days” will remain a challenge for the asset, especially since Bitcoin trades 24/7, unlike traditional stock markets with trading hours. “Because it trades 24/7, if people are worried about how things are going to open on Monday, some pools of capital can sell their Bitcoin on a Sunday and prepare,” she said. Alden explained that crypto's round-the-clock trading contributes to its ""volatile pricing,"" particularly when traditional financial markets are “freaking out.” Bitcoin is down 0.95% over the past 30 days. Source: CoinMarketCap At the time of publication, Bitcoin is trading at $84,950, according to CoinMarketCap data. However, Alden said Bitcoin can “disconnect” from the Nasdaq 100, especially in situations that “hurt Nasdaq margins” without affecting global liquidity. As an example, she pointed to a potential repeat of the five years leading up to the 2008 global financial crisis, which she believes could be favorable for Bitcoin. Related: Bitcoin whales absorb 300% of newly mined BTC supply — Is $100K next? She pointed to the 2003–2007 period, where there was a weaker US dollar cycle, and while there wasn’t a mass exodus of capital, it did flow into “emerging markets,” commodities, gold, and other assets — with US stocks not “really being the place to be.” “If we encounter a five-year period like that again, that could be a period where Bitcoin does pretty well, even as the US stock market doesn’t do particularly well.” Alden wrote in a September research report that Bitcoin moves in the direction of global M2 83% of the time in a given 12-month period. The research termed “Bitcoin a Global Liquidity Barometer” compared Bitcoin to other major asset classes such as SPX, gold and VT, and BTC topped the correlation index concerning global liquidity.

The country is advancing its digital asset regulation, testing legal frameworks, and launching licensed platforms. One of the key steps in this direction is the launch of A7A5 — a stablecoin introduced to bring increased stability and utility within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The token was issued by the Kyrgyz company Old Vector, in full compliance with local regulatory requirements and with the support of the Kyrgyz government. One of the world’s leading crypto hubs As part of the strategic course set by the country’s president, Kyrgyzstan has adopted a comprehensive package of laws regulating the cryptocurrency market. For the first time, the country has introduced full legislation on digital assets, covering all major aspects of the industry — from exchanges to token issuers. This has created a new institutional infrastructure that did not previously exist in the market. Among the unique innovations is the mechanism for registering token issuances under official state supervision. Regulators ensure that token emissions comply with legal standards, are backed by fiat reserves, undergo regular audits, and meet all obligations to token holders. In essence, Kyrgyzstan provides one of the most transparent and secure tokenization models in the world. The first issuance of A7A5 (mint) was carried out in full accordance with the new national legislation — under the supervision of regulatory authorities and directed to a licensed and registered broker. A7A5 is now available for trading on the regulated Meer Exchange and is expected to be listed on decentralized platforms in the future. Its fiat reserves are securely stored in bank accounts and audited quarterly by independent firms. One of the key advantages of A7A5 is the opportunity to earn up to 20% annually , powered by a combination of reserve-backed support and additional DeFi-based income strategies. For those seeking an alternative The digital asset market is increasingly blending traditional finance with decentralized technology. Stablecoins have enabled users to: Transition from volatile crypto assets to stable currencies while staying within the blockchain ecosystem. Freely trade against the world’s leading reserve currency. Participate in DeFi protocols that offer quasi-fixed returns — returns close to those of fixed-income assets. However, despite the growth of the overall market, stablecoins not pegged to the U.S. dollar are still in their early stages. Currency diversity? Still limited Although the segment has grown significantly, non-dollar stablecoins still show limited activity: USDT — over $60 billion in daily volume USDC — approximately $6 billion Euro-based stablecoins (e.g., EURT, agEUR) rarely exceed $5–10 million per day Stablecoins in yen or yuan are nearly absent from major platforms Stablecoins tied to emerging market currencies (such as reais, rupees, etc.) are virtually nonexistent in the global crypto landscape This lack of diversity limits the development of advanced currency strategies such as FX and carry trade , which form the backbone of traditional global financial markets — with a daily turnover exceeding $7 trillion . What’s preventing carry trade in crypto? To implement classic carry trade strategies in the digital asset space, several key components are still missing: One of the most common strategies in traditional finance is to borrow at a low interest rate in one currency and invest in assets with higher yields in another. However, DeFi currently lacks the infrastructure to borrow in most non-dollar currencies, rendering such strategies impractical. While borrowing in U.S. dollars within DeFi is possible, there is still no robust infrastructure to invest in yield-generating assets from emerging markets or to manage currency risk using derivatives. A7A5: Expanding the Possibilities The launch of A7A5 , with listings on both centralized and decentralized exchanges, represents a meaningful step toward broadening the range of tools available to crypto investors. It enables: Participation in yield strategies linked to emerging market assets Currency risk hedging through derivatives Both synthetic and direct access to Real-World Assets (RWA) via blockchain-based infrastructure A7A5 is designed for forward-thinking investors who want to use next-generation digital finance tools to seek enhanced returns, especially given the limitations of traditional financial markets.

Their recent performance, strong fundamentals, and global relevance make them clear contenders to dominate this cycle. However, there’s a bigger story quietly unfolding behind the scenes— MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining traction fast and may not just keep pace… it could leave them all behind . Let’s break it down head-to-head. FINAL CALL — ACT NOW & SECURE YOUR SPOT! BTC vs MAGACOINFINANCE BTC remains the undisputed store of value, but its growth ceiling is tightening.

Winner for ROI: MAGACOINFINANCE MAGACOINFINANCE UNDER $0.0004 — 100x COMING! XRP vs MAGACOINFINANCE XRP is riding the post-SEC wave and seeing bullish interest—but it’s also a mature asset now. MAGACOINFINANCE is where XRP was in 2017—fresh, unknown to the masses, and packed with upside. With the MAGA50X bonus , it’s not just speculative—it’s structured. Winner for early entry opportunity: MAGACOINFINANCE ETH, TON, AVAX, and SUI: Reliable, But Not Rivals Ethereum (ETH) will always lead Layer 1s, but it’s unlikely to be 10x again.

The roadmap outlines a three-phase plan to move millions of users, or “Pioneers,” to the open network. But here’s the catch—there’s no timeline, no dates, and still a lot of uncertainty. Three Phases, No Dates Recently Pi Network team has outlined the roadmap in a three-phase migration plan. Meanwhile, this plan is to help move users to the main network and bring more clarity to its tokenomics and supply structure. As per the update, the first Phase will focus on migrating users who are already in line. This includes mining rewards, contributions to the Security Circle, locked-up tokens, app-based rewards, and some node rewards. Once that’s done, Pi will move on to phase two, which involves referral rewards—but only for those whose team members are fully KYC verified. The third phase is described as “ongoing periodic migrations,” which might happen monthly or quarterly. But again, there’s no specific schedule. The roadmap simply says the pace is “to be determined.” This lack of a schedule has frustrated many users who’ve been active on the platform for years. Missing Info Leaves Users Frustrated Eventually, the roadmap doesn’t explain how many Pioneers are still waiting or how fast they can be processed. Without this, no one knows when their turn will come. Some users say they’ve been pressing the “claim” button daily but still haven’t received their core mining rewards. Others report that even partial rewards have arrived without clear explanations. Pi also says that the displayed “Transferable Balance” may be lower than what’s migrated. While this is done to save resources, users worry that it creates confusion and reduces trust. Still No Way to Fix Errors Adding to the concern, Pi still hasn’t shared how many users are left in the migration queue or how fast they can be processed. And there’s no system in place to challenge missing or incorrect reward data. For a project that’s been in the works for six years, users expected more transparency. Some Pioneers are even beginning to question the project itself, if all Pi coins were pre-minted, what was the purpose of all that “mining”? Pi Coin Price Outlook With Pi’s value already down 4x from its all-time high, the lack of clear updates is making many people lose trust in the project. As of now, Pi is trying to bounce back, up by 6.5% and trading around $0.65 after its recent fall.”",News,EN,0,0,MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-19 04:43:48

Static content, rigid structures, and limited accessibility prevent many people from realizing their full potential. But what if education could be immersive, dynamic, and even rewarding? Legacy Network answers that question by reshaping how knowledge is acquired and applied in a digital-first world. Legacy Network combines AI and blockchain to create a smarter, more interactive learning environment. The company’s flagship product, Legacy Academy, transforms conventional education into an engaging, gamified experience. It ensures deeper knowledge retention while offering financial incentives for participation. Legacy Network isn’t just adapting to change—it’s setting a new standard for how education functions in the digital era. A Smarter Way to Learn Legacy Network disrupts traditional models by integrating AI-powered personalization with blockchain-backed credentialing. This means users receive tailored learning paths, intelligent feedback, and verifiable achievements that translate into real-world value. Unlike outdated methods that rely on passive consumption, Legacy Academy cultivates active engagement by making learning intuitive and rewarding. The on-chain reward system, powered by the $LGCT multichain utility token, provides tangible incentives for users to complete courses and expand their skill sets. This approach not only makes education more engaging but also creates an ecosystem where learning becomes an investment in one’s future. A key utility of the $LGCT token is its buy-back and burn (BBB) mechanism, which aligns with Legacy Academy’s unique position in the market. Unlike many projects that launch BBB systems without significant demand, Legacy Academy benefits from a product that already has close to a million downloads and thousands of daily active users. Payments made for the product will partly flow back to the token, facilitating a wealth transfer from Web2 to Web3. This model doesn’t rely solely on Web3 demand but leverages proven product-market fit from the larger Web2 audience, making it a sustainable and valuable approach to education. Making Web3 Education Accessible For many, blockchain and AI remain complex, creating technical barriers that limit adoption. Legacy Network addresses this challenge by introducing intuitive solutions. By eliminating friction in onboarding, Legacy Network empowers individuals to gain confidence in emerging technologies, preparing them for an economy that increasingly values digital literacy. Through gamification and real-world application, the company ensures that learning extends beyond theory, equipping users with practical skills that translate into career and entrepreneurial opportunities. A Vision Rooted in Innovation and Impact Founded in Ruggell, Liechtenstein, by a team passionate about education and technology, Legacy Network emerged from a need to modernize learning for a generation accustomed to digital interactivity. Early challenges—including securing funding, navigating European regulations, and overcoming industry skepticism—only strengthened the company’s resolve to break down barriers in education. Now a growing global force, Legacy Network has expanded from a small startup to an organization with over 40 employees worldwide. It is backed by strategic partnerships that support its continuous evolution. With AI-powered education gaining traction, Legacy Network stands as a key innovator shaping the future of learning. The Future of Learning Starts Here Education is no longer confined to static textbooks and lecture halls. Through Legacy Academy, learners engage in a world where knowledge is dynamic, personalized, and rewarding. By leveraging AI and blockchain, Legacy Network envisions the future of education and is actively building it. With a strong commitment to accessibility, innovation, and tangible rewards, Legacy Network is transforming how individuals learn, grow, and prepare for the digital economy. The future of education is here—and it’s more interactive and impactful than ever.

It’s now trading at $0.64, and the move has sparked fresh interest from the Pi Network community. Some traders are wondering if this could be the start of a new rally—but not everyone is convinced. 7.8 Million Coins Unlocking Could Shift Momentum The price bump comes just ahead of a key event: 7.8 million Pi coins are set to unlock on April 19 . This follows an ongoing trend of daily unlocks—around 6.8 million coins released each day. According to market analyst Dr. Altcoin, most of these newly unlocked coins are heading straight to centralized exchanges , increasing sell pressure. In the last few days, the amount of Pi available on exchanges has risen from 354 million to 368 million. Meanwhile, total circulating supply has reached 6.88 billion coins. The result? A market is overwhelmed by sellers. Demand hasn’t been able to keep up, pushing the price down and making it harder for any rally to hold. Dr. Altcoin warned that if this trend continues, Pi could fall to $0.30 or even lower.

Binance, like other major exchanges, requires projects to meet several conditions before listing—such as a full mainnet launch, strong liquidity, legal compliance, and clear transparency. Until Pi Network checks those boxes, it’s unlikely to be listed. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

He says the US dollar is weakening and the economy is not in good shape. With Donald Trump’s new trade policies making things worse , Kiyosaki thinks the problems are starting to show. But he also says it is not too late. If people take action now, they can still protect their money. Kiyosaki’s Repeated Playbook – It’s finally coming? Kiyosaki in his latest X post has issued another stark warning about the US economy. In his latest update, he said America may be heading into a “ Greater Depression ,” which he believes could be worse than the 1930s. According to Kiyosaki, the financial system is already showing signs of collapse, and he’s urging people to prepare now. Ecohing the same sentiment, the crypto community is fearing that history might repeat itself as the current economic collapse is similar to last depression. The 1929 Great Depression began with rising tariffs + falling trade Today, the stage is set for this EXACT same scenario This could get ugly… pic.twitter.com/NMWzMAyE37 — Bravos Research (@bravosresearch) April 18, 2025 Debt is Rising and Savings are Shrinking In 2025, US credit card debt and national debt will reach historic highs. At the same time, unemployment is increasing, and traditional retirement savings like 401(k)s are losing value. Kiyosaki also highlighted that pensions are no longer secure, putting millions at risk of financial instability. He expressed concern that many Americans are not aware of how fragile the situation has become. Recent policies, especially new tariffs pushed by Donald Trump, are worsening the economic outlook and dragging business sentiment down even further. He Says He Saw It Coming Kiyosaki emphasized that he had warned people in books like Rich Dad’s Prophecy, Fake, and Who Stole My Pension. He said many who paid attention are now better off, while others who ignored the warnings might face serious trouble. He stressed the importance of not giving in to fear but instead making bold financial moves before it’s too late. Gold, Silver, and Bitcoin as Lifelines Kiyosaki’s main advice remains the same: invest in gold, silver, and Bitcoin. He believes these are the safest bets in today’s financial climate. He predicts Bitcoin could hit $1 million by 2035 , while gold and silver could reach $30,000 and $3,000, respectively. For those willing to act now, he says this crisis could turn into a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. A Call for Immediate Action His message is also about mindset. Kiyosaki believes many people stay poor because they keep hesitating. He says statements like “I’ll try” or “I’ll wait” can be dangerous during times like this. Instead, he’s calling on people to get financially educated, create a plan, and take action. In his view, the coming depression will create massive poverty for some, but huge wealth for those who are ready. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

After reaching highs above $3.40, the asset has experienced an 18.3% decline over the past month, reflecting broader market softness. At the time of writing, XRP trades significantly below its peak at a price of $2.06, with subdued investor activity and falling market participation across both spot and derivatives markets. Related Reading: XRP Breakout Still Likely This April, Analyst Says $12+ In Play XRP On-Chain Activity Slows, But Price Remains Relatively Stable Amid XRP’s decline, a CryptoQuant analyst known as EgyHash has recently shared his analysis on the altcoin in a post titled, “XRP’s Market Paradox: With Ledger Activity Dipping 80%, Is a Rebound on the Horizon?” According to EgyHash, XRP’s on-chain and futures market data presents a mixed picture—declining activity but resilience in price. EgyHash noted that XRP Ledger activity has fallen sharply since December, with the percentage of active addresses down by 80%. Similar declines have been observed in the futures market, where open interest has dropped roughly 70% from its highs, and funding rates have occasionally turned negative. He added that the Estimated Leverage Ratio, which gauges average user leverage by comparing open interest to coin reserves, has also dropped significantly. Despite these indicators pointing to weakening momentum, the altcoin’s price has only declined about 35% from its peak. This is a milder correction compared to other assets such as Ethereum, which has fallen roughly 60% over the same period. Additionally, the altcoin’s Exchange Reserve has continued to decline, reaching levels last observed in July 2023. Lower reserves typically suggest that fewer tokens are available for immediate sale, a factor that can help support prices during market downturns. According to EgyHash, this trend, along with relatively stable pricing, could indicate growing long-term confidence in the asset. Institutional Developments Could Strengthen Market Sentiment While on-chain metrics remain a focus, institutional developments may also play a role in shaping XRP’s future trajectory. Hong Kong-based investment firm HashKey Capital recently announced the launch of the HashKey XRP Tracker Fund—the first XRP-focused investment vehicle in Asia. Backed by Ripple as the anchor investor, the fund is expected to transition into an exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the future. The initiative is designed to attract more institutional capital into the XRP ecosystem. HashKey Capital is launching Asia’s first XRP Tracker Fund—with @Ripple as an early investor. This marks a major step in expanding institutional access to XRP, the third-largest token by market cap. 🧵👇 — HashKey Capital (@HashKey_Capital) April 18, 2025 HashKey Capital has also indicated that this collaboration with Ripple could lead to further projects, including tokenized investment products and decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. Related Reading: XRP To $50? Technical Analyst Lays Out The Roadmap Vivien Wong, a partner at HashKey, emphasized the strategic value of integrating Ripple’s network with regulated investment infrastructure across Asia. Although the altcoin faces near-term pressure, long-term developments, including decreasing exchange reserves and rising institutional interest, may support its recovery as the broader market stabilizes.

Despite the strong numbers, the network has faced a drop in revenues and activity, specifically after peaking in January with $35.9 billion in daily DEX volume. By mid-march, it had fallen below a billion but recovered above $2.5 billion, nearly matching Ethereum. Has a shift towards utility and stablecoins from memecoins deprived the SOL price of yet another bull run? The institutional interest in Solana has risen substantially as Galaxy Digital pulled a huge amount of SOL from CEX and deposited nearly $100M in ETH. This raised the speculation of whether the institution is dumping Solana, as the total number of SOL withdrawals from CEX amounted to $77.5 million since the start of the week. However, the transfer from Galaxy Digital squashed the bearish possibilities, as they have now withdrawn over 600K SOL from exchanges and staked over 460K in the past 4 days, as suggested by Lookonchain. Galaxy Digital has withdrawn 606K $SOL ($79.7M) from exchanges and staked 462K $SOL ($60M) in the past 4 days. https://t.co/WrqltmDhXA pic.twitter.com/eCffZuKNey — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 19, 2025 Is Solana Golden Cross on the Horizon? With this, the SOL price has raised the possibility of a bullish breakout as the technicals have turned bullish. The latest rebound from the lows has helped the token to break out of the descending parallel channel. After the breakout from the pattern, the bulls have managed to keep up the trend of the rally above the resistance of the channel. On the other hand, the Supertrend has changed to bullish after being bearish since February, validating a bullish reversal. Besides, the Ichimoku cloud has also experienced a bullish crossover, substantiating a bullish claim. With this, the price, which has discovered a new support at the 50-day MA, is expected to head towards a ‘Golden Cross’ and surpass the 200-day MA in the coming days. Meanwhile, a continued rise of 30% to reach $150 may trigger a Golden Cross, which may further push the Solana (SOL) price to $200 before the end of H1, 2025.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ETH|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-19 05:35:52

TRUMP Coin just triggered investor panic with a massive token unlock as 40 million coins flood the market, and CHEEMS shocked the space with its surprise Binance listing, doubling overnight. But amid this chaos, something huge is brewing in the presale trenches—and it might be your last chance to get in early. Meet BTFD Coin (BTFD) , the best 100x crypto presale that’s defied bear pressures and flown past $6.54 million raised with over 72 billion coins sold. Stage 15 is flying, and with just one more stage left before launch, time’s running out to grab this underpriced beast at $0.0002. From its live P2E game to a 90% APY staking setup and a monster referral program, BTFD isn’t just riding the meme wave—it’s building a movement. Let’s dig in and break down why BTFD might be the smartest play before May 26. BTFD Coin (BTFD) – The Presale That Refuses to Sleep Imagine scooping up 35 million coins today for just $7,000. That’s what you get with BTFD at its current stage 15 price of $0.0002. When the price hits $0.0006 at launch, that same bag turns into $21,000. And if it rockets to its moon target of $0.006? You’re looking at $210,000. Numbers don’t lie—especially when over 11,800 holders have already gone in and snatched 72 billion BTFD coins in this meme coin presale , and momentum’s only picking up. The final presale stage wraps up on May 26, and with just one tier left, it’s not just retail jumping in. Whales are circling, and big buys are landing. Why? Because BTFD’s not your average hype coin—this project has guts. The full P2E game is already live, letting you grind and earn BTFD as you play. Not to mention, staking went live early with a whopping 90% APY, giving investors serious passive income potential. But here’s where it gets wild—the BTFD referral program lets you earn 10% of what your friends raise when they use your referral code. The top 20 referrers each month get paid out in tokens, and the competition resets at the start of each month. It’s not just about holding; it’s about building your bull pack and stacking extra tokens on the side. Powered by Ethereum and backed by a passionate Bulls Squad, BTFD Coin flips every dip into a win. The ecosystem includes community rewards, influencer allocations, locked liquidity, and token burns—all designed to keep this coin running long after the presale buzz fades. It’s not just a coin; it’s a whole culture of degen pride built into one of the best 100x crypto opportunities of the year. Buy BTFD Coins Now – Don’t Sleep on This! Go to the BTFD Presale Platform Connect your wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.) Input the amount of BTFD you want Smash “Buy Now” and confirm it in your wallet Lock in your stack before the bulls stampede past you. CHEEMS (CHEEMS) – Community Energy and Binance Buzz While BTFD is stealing the presale spotlight, CHEEMS has been making waves too. After completing its 1:1 migration to the BNB Chain, the token saw a 100% spike. And it’s February 9, Binance listing only added fuel to the fire. With a current market cap hovering around $275 million and 67% price growth in the past 30 days, CHEEMS is dancing back into meme coin relevancy. Its appeal? It’s a community-first token with no dev tax or centralized control—a throwback to the pure meme coin era. But while CHEEMS is hot, it’s already flying. That’s what makes BTFD’s low-entry presale price so dang attractive. OFFICIAL TRUMP (TRUMP) Coin – Big Unlock, Bigger Questions TRUMP Coin came in like a rocket back in January, topping $74 and almost hitting $14B in market cap. But here’s the catch: starting April 17, 40 million tokens began unlocking—worth around $320 million. Analysts are already bracing for a drop to $6–$7, maybe even $3 by May. While TRUMP still has real-world use like merch buying and loyalty perks, that kind of sell pressure ain’t something small investors can ride out. Meanwhile, BTFD presale buyers are sitting pretty, shielded from these market jolts, locked in at a guaranteed low. The Final Word – It’s Now or Never! Think about it: TRUMP Coin is facing sell pressure, CHEEMS is doing its best to maintain the momentum—and BTFD? It’s still in presale, still affordable, and still rewarding early investors before the rest of the market catches on. Based on current trends and real market data, BTFD Coin is checking all the right boxes to be the best 100x crypto of 2025. Whether it’s the APY, the P2E rewards, the smart staking structure, or the viral Bulls Squad, BTFD has utility, traction, and a loyal army behind it. Stage 15 is almost out. May 26 is the deadline. Don’t be the one reading “what if” stories when you could be cashing in moon bags. Join the BTFD Coin presale right now and make the dip your biggest move yet.

It offers live staking at 90% APY, a P2E game, and a killer referral system, all before even launching. Is the TRUMP Coin a good investment now? The token unlock could cause price dips, so many are cautious about entering right now. Is CHEEMS still worth watching? Definitely. After its Binance listing and BNB Chain move, it’s showing strong community growth. How can I buy BTFD Coin during the presale?

Firing over disagreement is a slippery slope, says Pompliano Pompliano said, “Where you have a disagreement and then the firing, I think that’s not really the area that we want to go into.” “The idea of firing the Fed chairman is a very bad precedent to set this way.” It comes after Trump took to his social media platform Truth Social to accuse Fed chair Jerome Powell of being too slow to cut interest rates. “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” Trump said on April 17. Anthony Pompliano made the remarks on his online show “From The Desk of Anthony Pompliano.” Source: Anthony Pompliano Pompliano explained that while the Fed is meant to operate independently, he agrees with critics who argue it’s not truly independent. “The Fed, I think, is highly politicized, even though they pretend not to be,” he said. Pompliano acknowledged his own criticism of the Fed, saying he's not exactly a fan, but emphasized that even if the Fed has made mistakes, responding in kind isn't the right approach. “I still think that just because somebody else is doing something wrong doesn't mean that you should do something wrong,” Pompliano said. US Senator Elizabeth Warren recently warned that if Trump eventually moves to fire Powell, it could undermine investor confidence in the integrity of US capital markets and trigger a financial crash. “A big part of our economy strong, and a big part of the world economy strong, is the idea that the big pieces move independently of politics,” Warren said during an appearance on CNBC. Related: Fed’s Powell reasserts support for stablecoin legislation Lower interest rates often lead to increased liquidity, which has historically led to higher prices of perceived riskier assets like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It comes not long after Powell said establishing a stablecoins legal framework was a “good idea.” In an April 16 panel at the Economic Club of Chicago, Powell said, “The climate is changing, and you’re moving into more mainstreaming of that whole sector, so Congress is again looking [...] at a legal framework for stablecoins.” Magazine: Your AI’ digital twin’ can take meetings and comfort your loved ones",,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-04-19 05:50:28

Filan shared a procedural update on the long-running legal battle between Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The announcement, posted on X, confirmed that the court has granted the joint motion by both parties to hold the SEC’s appeal in abeyance . As stated by Filan, “The @SECGov is directed to file a status report within 60 days of this Order.” The court’s decision to delay the proceedings has triggered mounting frustration from long-time XRP holders, some of whom have been following the case closely since it was filed in December 2020. One of the most vocal responses came from XRP community member Micah Paul XRP, who commented directly under Filan’s post. In a highly charged response , he wrote: “60 more days and then 60 days for Ripple and then 90 days for the court and then 90 days for the judge and then 60 days for the clerk of court and then 60 days for final final briefs and then 90 days for paperwork and then……. For fuck sake end this bull shit already.

For fuck sake end this bull shit already. I’m tired.… https://t.co/b2woeetlTy — Micah Paul XRP ™️ (@MicahPW20) April 16, 2025 Micah’s statement reflects the exhaustion felt by many retail investors in the XRP community , who have grown increasingly discouraged with the drawn-out nature of the SEC v. Ripple litigation. While the comment employs a sarcastic tone to illustrate the seemingly endless cycle of court deadlines, its core message is a direct appeal for closure. Concerns Over Ripple’s Competitive Position Intensify The frustration is not limited to Micah alone. Other users in the XRP community echoed similar sentiments. User @RYNO8180 replied , “The thing that concerns me the most is this constant continuance gives other crypto projects time to catch up to Ripple. Ripple has been engaging and developing relationships worldwide and hustling to get proper permits and licenses. This needs to end!!!” His comment highlights a strategic concern shared by some XRP holders—that prolonged legal uncertainty may impact Ripple’s competitive edge in the broader crypto and fintech sectors.

But if it were easy… It’s not, we know where it ends—we just have to get through it. It’s harder for me as I’m leveraged in several ways, but I know I’m right, so I’ll make it through, even if it kills me.” $Immortality’s response underscores the personal financial stakes some community members face as the legal process continues to extend. Extended Legal Uncertainty Weighs on XRP Holders The court’s decision to pause the appeal process, while the procedure has nevertheless amplified broader frustrations from XRP holders who feel trapped in a legal limbo. Many were hopeful for a faster resolution following Judge Analisa Torres’s summary judgment in July 2023 , which ruled that XRP itself is not a security in programmatic sales. However, the SEC’s pursuit of some aspects of the case through the appeal process extended the timeline for a resolution. Micah Paul XRP’s comment has resonated with others who share his fatigue and impatience. His statement reflects the psychological toll and financial anxiety in prolonged regulatory disputes in the crypto space. As the legal process continues at a measured pace, XRP holders remain uncertain about when a final resolution will be reached.

According to market analysts, this area is critical. As long as XRP stays above $1.21, the overall bullish structure remains intact. The recent price pullback is being seen as part of a normal wave pattern—specifically, wave four in a five-wave structure. If this pattern plays out, XRP could soon enter wave five, which might take the price as high as $5.65 or even $6.60. Short-Term Structure Points to Key Decision Levels But for this to happen, XRP must avoid slipping below $1.21. If it does, a deeper drop could follow, possibly testing lower support levels between 88 cents and 61 cents. However, most analysts believe such a deep correction doesn’t align well with the bigger market picture. The next big test will be whether XRP can stay above the $1.82 level. If that support holds and the price breaks above the recent high of $2.13 set on April 16, it could be the start of the next strong leg up. In that case, XRP may head toward the $2.46 mark and beyond. Final Stage of Consolidation? Crypto analyst Dark Defender has called this period the “Final Consolidation” of XRP’s monthly structure. He believes the sideways movement is nearly over and a breakout could be near. He highlighted resistance levels at $2.22 and $2.30. If XRP moves above those, it may quickly push toward targets at $3.75 and even $5.85. For now, XRP remains in a tight zone, with every move watched closely. The coming days will be important. If the current support levels hold, the next chapter for XRP could be a bullish breakout that long-term holders have been waiting for.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-19 05:56:13

While BTC and XRP offer long-standing credibility and strength, experts are now paying special attention to MAGACOINFINANCE —a new presale project that’s moving faster than most of the top 50 coins combined. STAGE 6 SOLD OUT — STAGE 7 LIVE NOW MAGACOINFINANCE Is Gaining Favor Among Market Strategists Private analyst briefings and altcoin reports are increasingly naming MAGACOINFINANCE as the top early-stage altcoin with real breakout potential . It’s not just trending—it’s being dissected by savvy investors and discussed in high-level crypto investor groups. What’s drawing this attention? It’s the combination of early market entry, real-time momentum, and a 25x ROI projection that puts it in a league of its own. Add in the still-active MAGA50X bonus , and many experts believe this could be the best-performing presale of 2025 . “MAGACOINFINANCE is showing the kind of traction we saw with DOGE, SHIBA, and PEPE—except this time, there’s a launch plan behind it.” – Altcoin Research Council, April 2025 PRESALE LIVE NOW – CLICK HERE TO SECURE A SPOT BTC and XRP: Safe Picks With Slower Multipliers Analysts still rate Bitcoin and XRP as critical to any long-term portfolio. BTC is a reliable 2x–3x mover with institutional interest. XRP may see 4x upside as cross-border adoption and legal clarity push it forward. But both are mature assets— they won’t multiply the way early-stage tokens can .

Recent news from OpenAI might raise eyebrows. While their new o3 and o4-mini AI models are cutting-edge in many ways, they’re grappling with a surprising setback: increased AI hallucinations . Yes, you heard it right. These advanced models are making things up more often than their predecessors. Let’s dive into why this is happening and what it means for the future of AI. Why Are OpenAI’s New Reasoning AI Models Hallucinating More? For years, the tech world has been tackling AI hallucinations – those instances where AI systems confidently present false or fabricated information as truth. It’s a persistent challenge, even for the most sophisticated models. Historically, with each new iteration, AI models showed slight improvements, hallucinating less than before. However, OpenAI’s o3 and o4-mini models have broken this trend. According to OpenAI’s internal evaluations, these so-called reasoning AI models are hallucinating more frequently than older OpenAI models, including o1, o1-mini, o3-mini, and even the well-regarded GPT-4o. What’s particularly concerning is that OpenAI itself isn’t entirely sure why this regression is occurring. Their technical report acknowledges that “more research is needed” to understand why AI hallucinations are becoming more pronounced as reasoning models scale up. Here’s a breakdown of the hallucination rates based on OpenAI’s PersonQA benchmark: Model Hallucination Rate (PersonQA) o4-mini 48% o3 33% o1 16% o3-mini 14.8% As you can see, o3 and o4-mini show significantly higher hallucination rates compared to their predecessors. This data clearly indicates a worrying trend in the development of these new OpenAI models . GPT-4o vs. New Reasoning Models: A Surprising Twist Interestingly, even OpenAI’s traditional, “non-reasoning” models like GPT-4o are outperforming these new reasoning models in terms of hallucination rates. This is quite unexpected, as reasoning models are designed to be more advanced and accurate. The issue seems to stem from the fact that while o3 and o4-mini excel in areas like coding and math, their tendency to “make more claims overall” also leads them to generate both more accurate and more inaccurate statements. Real-World Examples of AI Hallucinations in o3 Third-party testing by Transluce, an AI research lab, has provided concrete examples of these AI hallucinations . In one instance, o3 falsely claimed to have executed code on a 2021 MacBook Pro outside of ChatGPT and then copied the results into its answer. However, o3’s capabilities don’t extend to such actions, highlighting a clear fabrication. Neil Chowdhury, a Transluce researcher and former OpenAI employee, suggests that the reinforcement learning methods used for the o-series models might be amplifying issues that are usually mitigated in standard post-training processes. This suggests a fundamental challenge in how these new OpenAI models are being trained. What Are the Implications of Increased AI Hallucinations ? Reduced Trust and Reliability: Higher hallucination rates erode trust in AI systems, particularly in sectors where accuracy is paramount, such as legal and financial industries. Business Challenges: For businesses considering adopting these models, the increased risk of factual errors can be a significant deterrent. Imagine an AI drafting a contract riddled with inaccuracies – the consequences could be severe. Usability Concerns: Sarah Schwettmann, co-founder of Transluce, points out that the elevated hallucination rate of o3 might diminish its practical utility despite its other advancements. Are There Any Benefits to AI Hallucinations ? Surprisingly, AI hallucinations aren’t entirely negative. Some experts believe that they can contribute to a model’s creativity and ability to generate novel ideas. Kian Katanforoosh, CEO of Workera, mentions that while testing o3 in coding workflows, they’ve found it to be superior to competitors. However, he also notes that o3 tends to hallucinate broken website links. This highlights a paradoxical situation where the same mechanism causing inaccuracies might also fuel innovation. The Path Forward: Enhancing AI Accuracy One promising strategy to improve AI accuracy and reduce AI hallucinations is integrating web search capabilities. OpenAI’s GPT-4o with web search already achieves a remarkable 90% accuracy on SimpleQA. Extending this approach to reasoning models could potentially mitigate hallucination rates, especially when users are comfortable with involving third-party search providers. As the AI industry increasingly focuses on reasoning models for enhanced performance without excessive computational demands, addressing the issue of worsening AI hallucinations becomes critical. OpenAI spokesperson Niko Felix emphasizes that tackling hallucinations is an “ongoing area of research” and they are “continually working to improve their accuracy and reliability.” Conclusion: Navigating the Complexities of Reasoning AI OpenAI’s latest reasoning models, while powerful, present a perplexing challenge with their increased tendency to hallucinate. This revelation underscores the intricate nature of AI development and the ongoing quest for truly reliable and accurate AI systems. While the industry pivots towards reasoning models for their efficiency and enhanced capabilities, overcoming the hurdle of AI hallucinations is crucial for widespread adoption and trust, particularly in sensitive sectors within the cryptocurrency and financial world.

According to the court ruling , neither Santander’s customer agreement nor Massachusetts law requires the bank to block or investigate customer-authorized transactions, even when those transfers are tied to apparent fraud. Santander cleared after customer loses $751K to crypto scam he personally authorized In the period from December 2021 to January 2022, Garcia made two debit card purchases and seven wire transfers from his checking and savings accounts to the Metropolitan Commercial Bank of New York. The funds were subsequently used to purchase cryptocurrency via Crypto.com and a supposed trading platform called CoinEgg. However, Garcia later realized CoinEgg was a scam, leading to his $751,000 loss. He sued Santander for breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation, and violating Massachusetts consumer protection law. The argument was that the bank should have spotted and stopped the high‑risk transactions. The appeals panel, however, rejected all of Garcia’s claims. It pointed to Santander’s customer agreement, which states the bank may act when it suspects fraud—but isn’t obligated to do so. The court further emphasized that Massachusetts regulators have not imposed any blanket requirement for banks to monitor or block all potentially suspicious transactions. Garcia also cited language on Santander’s website promising the bank would “contact a customer” about questionable activity. However, the court found that such marketing language was not a binding legal duty. Critically, Garcia had personally authorized every transfer. He didn’t raise concerns with the bank until the funds were gone. Though the court’s decision holds limited precedential weight, it delivers a clear message: banks are not financial guardians against crypto-related losses, especially when customer-approved transactions. With crypto scams on the rise and regulatory scrutiny tightening, financial institutions are increasingly leaning on the exact terms of their customer agreements to shield themselves from liability. As this case illustrates, individuals moving large sums into speculative digital assets must do their own due diligence and implement personal safeguards against fraud. Garcia filed the original complaint in October 2022. After two years of legal back-and-forth—and decisions by both the Superior Court and the appeals court in Santander’s favor—his efforts to reclaim his lost fortune have ended in disappointment. Crypto scam losses explode 6,499% in 2025 as regulators tighten grip on Web3 projects This ruling is particularly timely, as crypto scams have been on the rise, and regulators are intensifying their scrutiny of digital asset markets. Data shows that crypto rug pulls wiped out nearly $6 billion in Q1 2025, up 6,500% from just $90 million a year earlier. Web3 projects have lost nearly $6 billion to rug pulls since the beginning of 2025, a 6,499% increase from the $90 million recorded during the same period last year, according to a new DappRadar report . As DappRadar’s blockchain analyst Sara Gherghelas notes, a single case accounts for most of the damage, as 92% of the amount “is tied to the Mantra incident,” which she describes as “one of the largest individual scams recorded in recent years.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

However, this only goes to show the dangers of investing in the ever-volatile meme coin niche. From $5.2M Profit to $335K Loss – Diamond Hand Gets Wrecked! 6 months ago, he bought 19.14M $LUCE at $0.0275 and held all the way, with an unrealized profit of over $5.2M at the peak. Now? $LUCE crashed over 70%, and he suffered a heavy loss of $335K. https://t.co/at6RNbB2VY pic.twitter.com/zPOxVLvILW — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 19, 2025 Meme coins rode the wave after the Trump presidential election victory in early November like no other, posting massive double- and even triple-digit gains within a short period of time. This led to a FOMO effect for the bigger ones but also prompted developers to create millions of new ones in the hope of capturing investors’ attention. Although the majority turned out to be typical rug pulls, few succeeded (briefly), and some early bird investors cashed in on good profits. However, the case above demonstrated by Lookonchain shows the dark side of failing to get out of these volatile and frankly dangerous, at times, coins. Inspired by the Vatican’s mascot Luce, the LUCE token, launched on Pump.Fun, is supposed to symbolize ‘hope, light, and a modern connection to youth culture, blending Catholic values with digital trends.’ It certainly symbolized light and hope for the aforementioned investor who stood at an unrealized profit of $5.2 million just six months ago, approximately at the time when the token’s price charted an all-time high of $0.32. However, it has lost 97% of its value since then, and trades below $0.01 now. Interestingly, LUCE’s price is now even lower than the screenshot from Lookonchain, meaning that the investors’ loss is even greater (if realized).

His message read: “Buy $XRP before the Central Bank of Russia officially announces they own it.” This statement negates the backdrop of a previously reported development from Russia’s central banking authority that included references to Ripple’s cross-border payment infrastructure. Russian Central Bank’s Reference to Ripple in Official Publication Farina’s remark builds upon earlier public disclosures made by the Central Bank of Russia in a publication titled “Digitalization of Payments and Implementation of Innovations in the Payment Market”. As covered by Times Tabloid , that document includes a detailed explanation of Ripple’s distributed ledger technology (DLT)-based payment system, outlining its operational mechanics in cross-border transfers. Ripple’s model, which facilitates tokenized money movement and conversion into local currencies, is highlighted in the Russian report as part of the country’s exploration into digital financial tools. The reference to Ripple in the official document led analysts and observers to examine the possibility that Russia could, at some point, utilize XRP—the digital asset native to the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and employed by Ripple to facilitate international liquidity in cross-border transactions. Farina’s tweet added a new layer to those assumptions by suggesting that the Central Bank of Russia may already hold XRP and has not yet made it public. Community Concerns Over Potential Political Fallout Community reactions to Farina’s tweet included concerns about the reputational implications of such a scenario. A user identified as TheRightWabbit replied : “That would be some terrible PR for XRP Edo. Everyone would claim it’s a criminal haven token and it’d drop to $1. Let’s hope they’re not the first to announce they’re using it. SWIFT, BRICS, FED sure, just not Putin otherwise they’ll scream ‘sanction dodging criminal token’ lol.” This sentiment echoes broader fears within the community that any perceived association between XRP and a sanctioned nation-state could be exploited by opponents to delegitimize the asset or undermine its utility on a global scale. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Speculation vs. Official Confirmation Earlier interpretations of the Russian document emphasized that while Ripple and XRP are mentioned explicitly, alongside components such as automated market makers (AMMs), price oracles, and Ripple’s discontinued smart contract platform, Codius, the report stops short of confirming any active integration of XRP into Russia’s financial operations. As pointed out by another X user, Janus the Watcher, the central bank’s acknowledgment of these tools does not equate to immediate or guaranteed implementation. Nonetheless, Farina’s tweet elevates the hypothesis that XRP could be privately held or potentially trialed by a sovereign financial authority. This would have implications not only for Ripple’s positioning in the digital asset industry but also for the broader geopolitical dimensions of blockchain adoption. Until further evidence surfaces, Farina’s tweet remains an assertion. However, in the evolving relationship between decentralized finance and state institutions, such remarks is to amplify interest in which digital assets may be quietly gaining traction at the institutional level.

He said Strategy will go bankrupt over Bitcoin. But if this is reverse psychology, it must be working on Saylor. His company still hasn’t stopped racing other firms for more BTC in whale-sized bites. Peter Schiff Pulls No Punches on BTC in X Spaces Gag To start off the program , Schiff said Bitcoin’s promoters sold it as a kind of digital gold, but it hasn’t performed like the precious metal at all, so the “marketing” was a “fraud.” “The idea that it’s digital gold has been destroyed because it trades nothing like gold. It’s just some kind of risk asset.” But, Bitcoin’s promoters did not say it would perform as an investment with ROIs like gold. They said it is similar in its economic properties to the metal because of its limited supply and the difficulty and cost of securing it. While it is true that Bitcoin’s price lately has not traded like gold, that’s because over timescales very relevant to individual investors it has performed fantastically better than the yellow metal. Bitcoin vs. Gold ROIs 2009-10 to Present INSIGHT: Gold’s growth is strong, but Bitcoin’s massive gains can’t be ignored. Gold just hit a new ATH of $3,310, while Bitcoin is consolidating.

On the X podcast, Schiff asked: “What purpose does Bitcoin serve? We got plenty of risk assets out there. It’s a super risk asset that’s going to go up faster than other risk assets. Based on what?” He added, “At least a tech stock- there’s the story there of future earnings that could materialize, you’re buying a business that could earn money.” Bitcoin provides a banking service, which is traditionally a very profitable, high-growth business because everyone needs it every day in a market economy. Moreover, Bitcoin does so in a way that is simple and fundamentally useful. It is proven to work reliably, fairly, transparently, and easily for anyone to use.

However, recent developments with ChatGPT have sparked a debate, with some users finding the latest feature not just personalized, but downright unsettling. Imagine having a conversation with ChatGPT , and suddenly, it starts referring to you by your name – a name you never explicitly provided. This isn’t science fiction; it’s the reality for some ChatGPT users, and the reactions are as varied as they are strong. Is this a leap forward in AI personalization or a step into the ‘ creepy AI ‘ territory? Let’s delve into this intriguing and slightly unnerving phenomenon. Why is ChatGPT Suddenly Calling Users by Name? The Mystery of AI Personalization The core question on everyone’s mind is: why is ChatGPT , an AI Chatbot developed by OpenAI , suddenly adopting this personalized approach? This behavior wasn’t always the norm. Previously, interactions with ChatGPT felt more transactional and less personal. Now, users are reporting instances where the AI Chatbot seems to pull their names out of thin air, using them within its reasoning process. This change raises several important questions about how OpenAI is evolving its models and what it means for user privacy and the future of AI personalization . Here’s what we know and what users are experiencing: Unexpected Name Mentions: Users are reporting that ChatGPT is using their names even when they haven’t explicitly shared them in the current conversation or past interactions. Mixed Reactions: The response to this feature is divided. Some find it unsettling and ‘ creepy AI ‘, while others are simply confused or indifferent. Unclear Origins: It’s not definitively known when this change was implemented or if it’s directly linked to ChatGPT’s upgraded ‘memory’ feature. Privacy Concerns: Even users who have disabled personalization settings are experiencing this, raising questions about data usage and privacy within OpenAI’s systems. The ‘Creepy AI’ Factor: Why Users are Uneasy About ChatGPT’s Personal Touch For many, the unprompted use of their name by ChatGPT triggers an ‘ creepy AI ‘ sensation. This isn’t just about a machine using a name; it’s about the perceived intent and implications behind it. Several users have voiced their discomfort, highlighting the uncanny valley effect – where something that is almost human, but not quite, creates a feeling of unease and revulsion. Consider these perspectives: Simon Willison’s Perspective: A software developer and AI enthusiast, Simon Willison, described the feature as “ creepy and unnecessary.” His sentiment resonates with many who feel this level of AI personalization is intrusive. Nick Dobos’s Dislike: Another developer, Nick Dobos, simply stated he “hated it,” reflecting a strong negative reaction to this unexpected personal touch from an AI Chatbot . Social Media Sentiment: Platforms like X (formerly Twitter) are filled with users expressing confusion and wariness. Comments range from finding it “like a teacher keeps calling my name, LOL” to outright rejection like “Yeah, I don’t like it.” These reactions aren’t just about names; they touch upon deeper concerns about AI Personalization and the boundaries of technology in our personal space. The ‘ creepy AI ‘ label stems from the feeling that ChatGPT is attempting a level of intimacy that feels inauthentic and possibly manipulative. Is AI Personalization Going Too Far? Balancing Utility and the Uncanny Valley OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, has hinted at future AI systems that will “get to know you over your life” to become “extremely useful and personalized.” The intention behind this direction is clear: to make AI Chatbots like ChatGPT more helpful and integrated into our daily lives. However, the current backlash against the name-using feature highlights a significant challenge – navigating the uncanny valley in AI personalization . The Valens Clinic, a psychiatry office in Dubai, offers an insightful perspective on why this AI personalization attempt might be backfiring. Their analysis points to the nuanced psychology of names: Aspect Explanation Names Convey Intimacy Using someone’s name is a powerful tool for building relationships and signaling personal connection. Authenticity is Key Overuse or insincere use of names can be perceived as fake and invasive, damaging the intended effect. Context Matters In the context of an AI Chatbot , using a name can feel forced and unnatural, especially if the user hasn’t explicitly shared it or expects this level of personal interaction. The core issue seems to be the ham-fisted approach to AI personalization . Users aren’t necessarily against personalization, but they are sensitive to feeling manipulated or as though the AI Chatbot is pretending to be something it’s not. The analogy of a toaster calling you by name resonates because it underscores the absurdity of expecting or wanting personal intimacy from inanimate objects or, in this case, from an AI Chatbot . OpenAI’s Response and the Future of ChatGPT’s Personalization Strategy As of now, OpenAI has not officially responded to requests for comment regarding this new AI personalization feature in ChatGPT . This silence leaves users and experts to speculate about the intentions and future direction of OpenAI’s development. It’s crucial for OpenAI to address these concerns and clarify: The Purpose of Name Usage: What is the intended benefit of ChatGPT using user names in its reasoning process? Is it aimed at improving user experience, or is there a different technical or strategic goal? Data Privacy Implications: How is ChatGPT accessing and utilizing user names? What measures are in place to ensure user privacy and data security, especially for those who have disabled personalization settings? User Control and Customization: Will users have the option to disable this feature if they find it ‘ creepy AI ‘ or undesirable? Providing users with control over the level of AI personalization is essential for building trust and acceptance. Future Personalization Strategies: What is OpenAI’s long-term vision for AI personalization in ChatGPT ? How will they balance the desire for more human-like interaction with the need to avoid the uncanny valley and respect user boundaries? The reactions to ChatGPT’s name-using feature serve as a valuable lesson for the AI industry. While AI personalization holds immense potential to enhance user experience and make technology more accessible and user-friendly, it must be implemented thoughtfully and ethically. Transparency, user control, and a deep understanding of user psychology are paramount to ensure that AI personalization efforts are welcomed rather than perceived as ‘ creepy AI ‘. Conclusion: Navigating the Fine Line Between Personalization and ‘Creepy AI’ The case of ChatGPT calling users by name highlights the delicate balance between beneficial AI personalization and the unsettling feeling of ‘ creepy AI ‘. While the goal of making AI Chatbots more personal is understandable, the execution and user perception are critical. OpenAI , and the broader AI Chatbot industry, must pay close attention to user feedback and ensure that advancements in AI personalization are driven by genuine user needs and ethical considerations, not just technological capabilities. The future of AI depends on building trust and ensuring that users feel empowered and comfortable, not alienated or creeped out, by increasingly sophisticated technologies like ChatGPT .

It notes that the massive movements from mid-term bitcoin holders often signals that something major is about to happen. Historically, these wallet movements have arrived right before major price swings, be it a breakout rally (green boxes) or a sharp drop (red boxes). Notably, this group of Bitcoin holders are often more reactive than long-term investors but tend to be calmer than short-term traders, which often acts key during market transitions. Similar patterns were noted before Bitcoin’s bull run in 2021 and the 2022 crash. Analysts note that although the direction is not clear, this is a warning sign of major volatility ahead. Bitcoin has lately been stuck between $75,000 and $87,000 recently due to the global trade tensions triggered by Trump’s tariffs. This has added to the uncertainty in the markets impacting investor confidence. Whales Bullish Despite Economic Pull Back Notably, Bitcoin whales and large investors are showing strong bullish sentiment despite the economic headwinds. According to data from Glassnode , whales and sharks are now accumulating BTC at over three times the yearly issuance rate, which marks the fastest pace in Bitcoin’s history. Besides, exchanges are witnessing historic outflows which indicates a shift towards long-term Bitcoin holding and self-custody. According to latest data from lookonchain , whales are stacking up Bitcoin. A wallet linked to Abraxas Capital recently withdrew 505 BTC worth over $42 million Binance. Notably, over the past four days, the wallet has withdrawn a total of 2,949 BTC worth $259 million. Such large moves indicate institutional confidence in Bitcoin. Whales/Institutions continue to accumulate $BTC ! Abraxas Capital related wallet withdrew another 505 $BTC ($42.64M) from #Binance 9 hours ago.

This could be a positive sign hinting a a potential short-term trend reversal. However this is less convincing as the breakout happened with a low trading volume, He notes that for Bitcoin to show real strength, it needs more buying and to break above $88,804 and the 200-day average. “Bulls need to follow through with strength”, he said.

Qubetics ($TICS) is one such standout project, leading the charge as the best crypto presale opportunity for 2025. Its innovative approach, including cross-border transactions and decentralized privacy solutions , positions it as one of the top cryptos with 100x potential . Whether for businesses, professionals, or individuals, Qubetics is providing the tools necessary to succeed in the evolving world of blockchain technology. In the broader market, Ethereum (ETH) has faced a downtrend over the past few months, but with the continued interest in ETH ETFs and stablecoins , the demand for decentralized storage and blockchain utility remains strong. Even as Ethereum struggles with ETF outflows and institutional pullbacks, its role as the dominant smart contract platform continues to drive innovation, especially in DeFi and NFTs . On the other hand, Tron (TRX) is experiencing a surge in USDT transactions , nearing a $70 billion milestone , reflecting the network’s growing adoption and utility. As Tron continues to break through key resistance levels, its scalability and low-fee transactions make it a promising top crypto with 100x potential in the short term. As these projects unfold, Qubetics continues to shine as a best crypto presale , perfectly positioned to cater to the future needs of blockchain and digital finance . Qubetics: The Top Crypto Presale of 2025 One of the standout features of Qubetics is its cross-border transaction capability , which makes it incredibly attractive to businesses and professionals seeking to streamline their international dealings. As the world becomes increasingly connected, the need for seamless, borderless financial systems has never been greater. With Qubetics’ interoperability , it allows for smooth asset transfers and communications across different blockchain networks, reducing friction and increasing liquidity for enterprises. For individuals , the non-custodial multi-chain wallet provided by Qubetics ensures that users have full control over their digital assets while offering multi-chain support . This simplifies the complexities that come with managing assets across various blockchain platforms, enabling individuals to access a broader range of decentralized services without being tied to a single network. Whether it’s making cross-border payments , accessing DeFi platforms , or interacting with NFTs , Qubetics offers an easy-to-use and secure solution for the modern digital economy. With Qubetics focusing on real-world use cases , it’s clear why Qubetics is the top crypto presale of the year. The growing community of backers , which now includes 24,900+ holders , further solidifies the project’s place in the blockchain ecosystem. The presale continues to generate interest, and the opportunity to buy $TICS tokens at the current stage is still available, making it one of the most promising investments of the year. Qubetics Presale: The Best Crypto Presale to Buy Now Currently in Stage 30 , Qubetics has raised over $16.2 million and sold more than 508 million tokens . The current presale price is $0.1729 per token, offering an attractive entry point for early buyers and backers who see the massive growth potential of this project. The early stage price of $0.01 per token has already yielded 1629% returns for those who got in at Stage 1 , and those joining at Stage 30 are still in a prime position to benefit. Analysts predict a 477% ROI if $TICS hits $1 after the presale. If the token reaches $5 , early adopters could see a 2789% ROI , and $6 would offer 3367% ROI . Once the mainnet launches, Qubetics could see prices soar, with predictions of $10 or even $15 , bringing returns of 5678% and 8567% , respectively. For community members looking for high-return investments , Qubetics provides a unique opportunity . The best crypto presale is not over yet , and there is still time to enter before the price increases. As the blockchain space continues to grow, Qubetics is perfectly positioned to provide real solutions to businesses and adopters . Ethereum (ETH): Resilience Amidst Challenges Ethereum (ETH) continues to hold a dominant position in the smart contract ecosystem, even though it’s faced some challenges in recent months. Ethereum’s price remains below $1,600 , and its Ethereum ETFs have seen a significant 60% drop in total net assets, primarily due to institutional outflows . Despite this, Ethereum remains the backbone of many decentralized applications ( dApps ) and is critical to the growth of DeFi and NFTs . Ethereum is currently dealing with a series of negative ETF flows , with over $909 million in outflows since Trump’s tariffs took effect. This has impacted its price and overall market performance, yet Ethereum continues to be a major player in the space. As Fidelity , Bitwise , Grayscale , and 21Shares seek SEC approval to allow staking within their ETH ETF products , the potential for yield generation through ETH ETFs could help slow the selling pressure on the token. Despite the downtrend , Ethereum remains a foundational asset in the crypto world, and it’s expected to recover as institutional interest grows and the SEC approval for staking becomes a reality. Tron (TRX): Riding High on USDT Transactions Tron (TRX) has proven itself as one of the top cryptos with 100x potential by nearing a massive $70 billion USDT milestone in total transactions. This significant achievement highlights the growing adoption and utility of the Tron network , especially for stablecoin transactions . As the Tron ecosystem continues to expand, USDT transactions remain one of the driving forces behind its growth, attracting traders and developers alike. Recently, Tron broke through a key resistance level , which signals the potential for further price appreciation . On-chain data also supports a bullish outlook , with analysts predicting that TRX could reach $0.40 in the near term, provided that market momentum remains strong. The scalability and low-fee nature of the Tron network make it an attractive choice for developers, particularly in the areas of gaming and dApps . As Tron continues to make its mark, its increasing utility and growing user base position it as one of the top cryptos for those looking to capitalize on the future of decentralized finance . Final Thoughts Qubetics , Ethereum , and Tron are shaping up to be the top cryptos to buy this month . While Ethereum deals with ETF outflows and a price decline , Tron continues to benefit from its strong use case in USDT transactions and decentralized finance . However, Qubetics emerges as the best crypto presale of the year, offering unparalleled interoperability , decentralized privacy solutions , and real-world utility that other platforms have yet to match. The ongoing presale presents an exciting opportunity for adopters and community members to secure a spot in one of the most promising projects in the space. With Qubetics’ presale still open, now is the time to join before prices rise. The potential for high ROI is undeniable, and the real-world use cases of Qubetics make it a top choice for anyone looking to invest in the future of blockchain. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQ Why is Qubetics considered the top crypto presale of the year?

43517977,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=150842,1745044254,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Belarus to Unveil Digital Ruble: Ambitious CBDC Launch by 2026,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/belarus-cbdc-digital-ruble-launch/,"Get ready for a digital transformation in Eastern Europe! Belarus is making significant strides in the world of digital finance, with plans to fully launch its own central bank digital currency (CBDC) , known as the digital ruble, by the second half of 2026. This ambitious project, spearheaded by the National Bank of Belarus, signals a major shift in how the nation approaches financial transactions and economic modernization. Let’s dive into what this means for businesses, individuals, and the future of money in Belarus. What is the Digital Ruble and Why Belarus is Embracing CBDC Launch? A central bank digital currency (CBDC) is essentially a digital form of a country’s fiat currency, issued and regulated by its central bank. Unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which are decentralized, a CBDC is centralized and backed by the government, just like traditional paper money. Belarus is not alone in exploring this innovative financial technology; many nations worldwide are researching or developing their own CBDCs to modernize their financial systems and enhance economic efficiency. Why is Belarus taking this leap? Several compelling reasons are likely driving this initiative: Modernizing Financial Infrastructure: A CBDC can provide a more efficient, secure, and technologically advanced payment system compared to traditional cash and legacy banking systems. Enhancing Financial Inclusion: Digital currencies can potentially reach underserved populations who may not have easy access to traditional banking services. Boosting Economic Efficiency: CBDCs can streamline payment processes, reduce transaction costs, and potentially accelerate economic activity. Improving Transparency and Traceability: As emphasized by National Bank Chairman Roman Golovchenko, fund traceability is a key benefit. CBDCs can offer greater transparency in financial transactions, which can be helpful in combating illicit activities and improving tax collection. Facilitating Cross-Border Payments: The announcement specifically mentions potential benefits for cross-border settlements, especially with Russia, which is also developing its own digital ruble. This could simplify and speed up international trade and financial interactions between the two nations. The Roadmap to Belarus CBDC 2026: Key Milestones and Expectations According to reports, the Belarus CBDC 2026 launch is planned in phases. Here’s a breakdown of the expected timeline and key milestones: Current Phase – Infrastructure Development: The National Bank of Belarus is currently focused on building the foundational infrastructure. This includes developing the necessary technology, establishing the regulatory framework, and creating the software platform that will underpin the digital ruble. Second Half of 2026 – Initial Launch for Businesses: The digital ruble is slated for a full-scale launch in the second half of 2026, initially targeting business use. This suggests that businesses will be the first to experience the benefits of the new CBDC in practical applications. 2027 – Broader Availability: By 2027, the plan is to expand the availability of the digital ruble to government entities and individuals. This phased rollout allows for testing and refinement in a controlled environment before wider public adoption. Phase Timeline Target Users Focus Infrastructure Development Currently Ongoing Internal – National Bank Building Technology and Regulatory Framework Initial Launch Second Half of 2026 Businesses Business-to-Business Transactions Broader Availability 2027 Government & Individuals Wider Public Adoption Digital Ruble Belarus: Benefits and Potential Challenges The introduction of the digital ruble Belarus promises several advantages, but it’s also important to consider potential challenges: Potential Benefits: Reduced Transaction Costs: Digital transactions can be significantly cheaper than traditional banking fees, especially for businesses dealing with high volumes of transactions. Faster Transactions: CBDC transactions can be processed much faster than traditional bank transfers, potentially even in real-time. Enhanced Security: Utilizing blockchain or similar technologies, CBDCs can offer enhanced security and reduce the risk of fraud. Improved Cross-Border Payments: As mentioned, the digital ruble could streamline cross-border transactions, particularly with Russia, fostering stronger economic ties. Greater Financial Transparency: Increased traceability can aid in combating money laundering and other illicit financial activities. Potential Challenges: Cybersecurity Risks: Digital systems are vulnerable to cyberattacks. Robust security measures will be crucial to protect the digital ruble infrastructure and user funds. Privacy Concerns: The traceability of CBDC transactions could raise privacy concerns among citizens. Balancing transparency with individual privacy will be a key challenge. Adoption and Education: Public adoption will depend on user-friendliness and public understanding. Education initiatives will be necessary to ensure widespread acceptance and effective use of the digital ruble. Integration with Existing Systems: Seamless integration with existing banking and financial systems is crucial for a smooth transition. What Does the Belarus CBDC Launch Mean for You? Whether you are a business owner in Belarus, a resident, or simply an observer of global financial trends, the Belarus CBDC launch is a development worth watching. For businesses in Belarus, the digital ruble could mean: New Payment Options: Access to a modern, potentially cheaper, and faster payment method. Streamlined Business Transactions: Easier and more efficient transactions, especially with government entities and potentially Russian partners. Adaptation to Digital Finance: Businesses will need to adapt their systems and processes to accommodate the digital ruble. For individuals, while broader availability is expected later, understanding CBDCs now is beneficial. It’s likely to eventually impact how citizens in Belarus manage their finances, make payments, and interact with the financial system. Conclusion: Belarus Stepping into the Future of Finance Belarus’s plan to launch its digital ruble by 2026 marks a significant step towards embracing the future of finance. While challenges remain, the potential benefits of a central bank digital currency , including enhanced efficiency, transparency, and cross-border payment capabilities, are compelling. As Belarus progresses with its digital ruble Belarus project, the world will be watching to see how this innovative initiative unfolds and shapes the nation’s financial landscape. This move positions Belarus as a forward-thinking nation in the evolving world of digital currencies and could pave the way for greater financial innovation and integration in the region.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-says-xrp-will-either-make-or-break-you-in-2025-heres-why/,"Prominent cryptocurrency analyst JD (@jaydee_757) has shared a technical chart analysis of the XRP/BTC trading pair that he believes marks a pivotal turning point for XRP holders. The chart, which spans from 2017 through 2027 on a monthly scale, illustrates a massive descending triangle pattern that appears to have finally broken to the upside. According to the JD, the breakout above the long-standing downtrend line signals that 2025 could be a decisive year for XRP investors — either delivering significant gains or resulting in a major rejection and prolonged downside. In his post, JD emphasized the importance of the current breakout zone, noting the region around 0.00002500 BTC as “very strong support” that “needs to hold.” This level corresponds with an area that has repeatedly been a pivot in past market cycles, both as support and resistance. #XRP – 2025 will either make you or break you… 💪🙏 $XRP /BTC (monthly scale)… pic.twitter.com/7Mg2Zi520r — JD 🇵🇭 (@jaydee_757) April 16, 2025 The structure, which shows XRP is consolidating within a narrowing range since its peak in early 2018, now shows a definitive breakout candle, positioning the asset above the descending resistance line for the first time in several years. Support Zone Must Hold for Bullish Continuation JD’s analysis suggests that if XRP can maintain its momentum and establish support above this critical level, the next logical price target lies in the green-highlighted zone above, which he notes could correspond to a potential surge in XRP’s market dominance relative to Bitcoin. If the breakout holds, the XRP/BTC pair may revisit levels not seen since early 2018. However, the analysis also highlights downside risk if support fails, which could invalidate the breakout and return the pair to its longer-term consolidation pattern. Two-Digit USD Target Not Ruled Out When asked by a follower what the green box would represent in USD terms, JD responded that he wasn’t exactly sure, but he believed it would be “in the 2 digits.” This suggests a potential XRP valuation above $10, depending on BTC’s price and market conditions. JD did not offer a specific USD target but hinted that further analysis is possible once a retracement level is confirmed. Waiting on Confirmation of Structure and Momentum Another follower, XRP Tony, raised the question of where JD believes XRP will top out in this cycle, particularly in light of significant developments related to Ripple, such as its acquisition of the fintech company Hidden Road . JD did not provide a final target but reiterated that price projections would become clearer once confirmation of structure and retracement levels is established on the chart. He added that he is “hoping to break out from its prior structure in lower timeframe (falling wedge).” 2025 Expected to Be Pivotal Year for XRP/BTC Performance JD’s chart does not show any definitive timing, but the structure of the pattern implies that the price action over the next several months will be crucial. The area highlighted in green suggests a bullish continuation. However, a red arrow pointing downward also acknowledges the risk of a failed breakout — something JD warns could result in a significant reversal into the broader triangle pattern. This technical setup, coupled with macro developments surrounding XRP and Ripple Labs , has set the stage for an important inflection point in XRP’s long-term performance relative to Bitcoin. While JD remains cautiously optimistic, the key to this bullish scenario remains the ability of XRP to maintain support above the breakout level and confirm it as a new base for further upward movement.

A sustained momentum above $2.20 could trigger an uptrend toward the $2.50 mark. That being said, weakening volumes could bring the price down to $2. XRP Price Prediction May 2025 XRP Price Prediction 2025 The SEC believes that XRP can help release funds stuck in the U.S. Nostro accounts, which can then be used to buy more Bitcoins. There is more positive news for Ripple, as they have integrated their stablecoin RLUSD into their cross-border payments network: Ripple Payments . Moreover, JP Morgan Chase has approved XRP for use within its banking payment framework. If things go in favor of Ripple, the XRP price could surge to a maximum of $5.81 by the end of 2025. In contrast, if the lawsuit continues, XRP could remain in a narrow range with a potential low of $2.3. That being said, we can expect an average price of $4.89. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.3 $4.89 $5.81 Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Year Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) 2026 5.6 6.25 8.64 2027 7.15 8.89 12.25 2028 11.3 14.11 16.53 2029 13.98 16.48 21.12 2030 16.92 19.87 26.97 XRP Price Prediction 2026 XRP price will likely witness strong growth in 2026. There is a possibility that XRP can break through the $8.64 level and hold the price by the end of 2026. The minimum XRP price will be around $5.6, with an average trading price of $6.25. This could be a result of Ripple’s role in CBDC development and XRP’s rising institutional demand. XRP Price Prediction 2027 By 2027, market analysts and experts predict that XRP’s price will range between $7.15 to $12.25. XRP price might record an average level of $8.89. The reason behind this surge could be due to Ripple’s increasing domination in the payment sector, accelerating XRP’s buying demand and utility. XRP Price Prediction 2028 In 2028, Ripple could increase its use cases, including new dApps and announcements regarding XRP. This might boost the dominance of XRP as the second-largest altcoin by market cap. We expect the XRP price to range between $11.3 to $16.53. The average trading price could be around $14.11. XRP Price Prediction 2029 Partnerships with multiple governments and wider adoption might strengthen XRP’s price in 2029. The altcoin might record a trading range between $13.98 to $21.12, with an average price of $16.48. XRP Price Prediction 2030 The long-term XRP price prediction depends on Ripple’s ability to expand its offerings across the crypto market. If everything remains positive, the XRP price could scale between $16.92 to $26.97. With that price range, the average tag could be $19.87.

As the second quarter of 2025 kicks off, Bitcoin has cooled down after its impressive rise earlier this year. The price is now moving between $83,000 and $85,000, as global tensions, interest rate concerns, and trade decisions under President Donald Trump weigh on investor sentiment. Still, there are signs that this could be the start of a healthy consolidation phase. Cowen, who closely tracks Bitcoin cycles, says the most important level to watch is the 2024 high. As long as Bitcoin stays above that point—even with brief dips or “wicks” below—he believes the current uptrend remains intact. A drop to the low $60,000s could still trigger a strong bounce, possibly pushing the price even higher than where it is now. He also pointed out that Bitcoin’s growth in this cycle is following a familiar pattern. Compared to previous cycles, returns are smaller—something he calls “diminishing returns.” But that doesn’t mean gains are over. In a best-case scenario, Cowen sees Bitcoin climbing to between $120,000 and $150,000, and maybe even as high as $200,000 if major events—like institutional or government buying—kick in. The real concern, Cowen says, would be if Bitcoin falls and fails to hold the 2024 high. That could signal what’s known as a “left translated cycle,” meaning the peak of this cycle has already passed. But for now, that scenario hasn’t played out. Looking back at the 2016–2017 cycle, Cowen reminds us that Bitcoin also briefly dipped below key highs before taking off again. This kind of short-term volatility, he explains, doesn’t necessarily break long-term market structure—unless it turns into sustained downward pressure.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-19 06:39:56

Canary Capital, a well-known crypto investment firm, has just taken a significant step by filing for a staked TRX ETF . This exciting development, revealed by the crypto data platform Unfolded on X, could open up new avenues for investors looking to tap into the Tron ecosystem and the rewards of staking. But what exactly does this mean for you, and why is it generating so much buzz in the crypto community? Let’s dive into the details. What is a Staked TRX ETF and Why is it Revolutionary? Before we get into the specifics of Canary Capital’s filing, let’s break down what a staked TRX ETF actually is. In simple terms: ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund): Think of an ETF as a basket of assets (in this case, TRX) that trades on a stock exchange, just like individual stocks. This makes it easier for traditional investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies without directly holding the digital assets themselves. Staked: Staking involves holding and locking up your cryptocurrency to support the operations of a blockchain network. In return, you typically earn rewards, often in the form of additional cryptocurrency. For Tron (TRX), staking is a key part of its network operation, allowing token holders to participate in governance and earn rewards. Staked TRX ETF: Combining these concepts, a staked TRX ETF would be an ETF that not only holds Tron (TRX) but also actively stakes a portion of those holdings to generate staking rewards. These rewards would then, in theory, be passed on to the ETF holders, enhancing the overall return. This is potentially revolutionary because it bridges the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning world of decentralized finance (DeFi). It offers a regulated and accessible way for investors to benefit from both the price appreciation of TRX and the passive income generated through TRX staking . Why is Canary Capital’s Move Significant for the Crypto ETF Landscape? Canary Capital’s filing is more than just news about a new financial product; it signals a growing maturity in the crypto market and the increasing acceptance of digital assets by traditional financial institutions. Here’s why this is a landmark moment: First Mover Advantage: If approved, this could be one of the first dedicated Tron ETF products in the market, giving Canary Capital a significant first-mover advantage. This could attract substantial investor interest, particularly from those already bullish on the Tron ecosystem. Validation for Tron (TRX): A major investment firm like Canary Capital seeking to launch a TRX ETF provides further validation for Tron as a viable and investable cryptocurrency. It suggests that institutional players are recognizing the potential of TRX and its underlying technology. Expanding Crypto ETF Options: The crypto ETF market is still relatively young, primarily focused on Bitcoin and Ethereum. A staked TRX ETF diversifies the available options, offering investors exposure to a different blockchain and its unique features, including staking rewards. Increased Accessibility: ETFs are known for their accessibility and ease of use. A crypto ETF , and specifically a staked one, can bring cryptocurrency investments to a broader audience, including those who are hesitant to navigate the complexities of crypto exchanges and wallets. What are the Potential Benefits of Investing in a Staked TRX ETF? Investing in a staked TRX ETF could offer several compelling benefits for both seasoned crypto enthusiasts and newcomers: Passive Income through Staking Rewards: The most significant advantage is the potential to earn passive income through staking rewards. Instead of just holding TRX and hoping for price appreciation, investors could earn additional TRX simply by holding shares of the ETF. Diversification: Adding a crypto ETF like a staked TRX ETF to your portfolio can enhance diversification. It allows you to spread your investments across different asset classes, potentially reducing overall risk. Ease of Access and Regulation: Investing in an ETF is typically simpler than directly buying and managing cryptocurrencies. ETFs are regulated investment products, offering a level of security and compliance that may appeal to more cautious investors. Tax Efficiency (Potentially): Depending on your jurisdiction, ETFs may offer certain tax advantages compared to directly holding and staking cryptocurrencies. It’s always best to consult with a tax advisor for personalized advice. Exposure to Tron Ecosystem Growth: Investing in a Tron ETF is essentially betting on the growth and adoption of the Tron ecosystem. As Tron continues to develop and expand its applications, the value of TRX and, consequently, the ETF could potentially increase. What are the Challenges and Risks Associated with a Staked TRX ETF? While the prospect of a staked TRX ETF is exciting, it’s crucial to be aware of the potential challenges and risks: Regulatory Hurdles: Like all crypto ETFs, a Tron ETF will need to navigate regulatory approvals. The SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) in the United States, for example, has been cautious in approving crypto ETFs. There’s no guarantee that this ETF will be approved, or how long the approval process might take. Staking Risks: Staking itself carries some risks, including potential lock-up periods for staked assets and the possibility of slashing (penalties for validator misbehavior). The ETF provider will need to manage these risks effectively. Volatility of TRX: TRX, like most cryptocurrencies, is known for its price volatility. The value of a TRX ETF will be directly tied to the price of TRX, making it subject to significant price swings. Management Fees: ETFs typically charge management fees, which can eat into returns. Investors will need to consider the expense ratio of the Canary Capital ETF and weigh it against the potential benefits. Liquidity and Tracking Error: While ETFs are generally liquid, there could be instances where the ETF price deviates slightly from the underlying value of TRX (tracking error). Liquidity could also be a factor, especially in the early days of a new ETF. Actionable Insights: Should You Consider a Staked TRX ETF? The emergence of a staked TRX ETF is undoubtedly a significant development for the crypto space. Whether it’s the right investment for you depends on your individual financial situation, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Do Your Research: Before investing in any ETF, especially a new and novel product like a staked crypto ETF , conduct thorough research. Understand the underlying asset (TRX), the ETF provider (Canary Capital), the ETF’s structure, fees, and associated risks. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Cryptocurrency investments are inherently risky. Be honest with yourself about your risk tolerance and only invest capital you can afford to lose. Consider Diversification: A TRX ETF can be a valuable tool for diversification, but it shouldn’t be your only investment. A well-rounded portfolio typically includes a mix of asset classes. Stay Informed: The crypto market is constantly evolving. Keep up-to-date with news and developments related to Tron, crypto ETFs, and regulatory changes. Follow reputable crypto news sources and analysts. Consult a Financial Advisor: If you’re unsure whether a staked TRX ETF is right for you, seek advice from a qualified financial advisor. They can provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards Mainstream Crypto Adoption Canary Capital’s filing for a staked TRX ETF is a bold and exciting move that could pave the way for greater mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. It represents a significant step forward in bridging the gap between traditional finance and the innovative world of crypto. While challenges and risks remain, the potential benefits of such a product, particularly in offering passive income through staking rewards and increased accessibility to the Tron ecosystem, are undeniable. As the crypto ETF landscape continues to evolve, keep a close eye on developments like these – they could reshape the future of crypto investing.

While crypto market interest remains steady, BTC is struggling to break out, hovering just below the key $85,000 level. As of writing, Bitcoin trades around $84,596 , down slightly in the last 24 hours and nearly 22% off its all-time high of over $109,000 set earlier this year. The momentum appears to be fading, prompting analysts to ask: Is another crash coming? Bitcoin Price Drop Reasons: Global Recession, High Interest Rates, and Deflation Fears In a recent Altcoin Daily podcast , Bloomberg Intelligence’s Mike McGlone , trader Scott Melker , and market expert Gareth Soloway discussed Bitcoin’s future and issued a chilling warning. Bloomberg Intelligence, senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone, warned that Bitcoin could crash to $10,000 if macroeconomic conditions worsen, specifically, if the S&P 500 sees a sharp correction down to 4,000 points. Deflation Fears Rise as Bitcoin and Stocks Decouple Bloomberg’s Mike McGlone says the global economy is showing signs of deflation, with key indicators flashing red. The U.S. stock market is now far above GDP levels, and the S&P 500 is moving out of sync with global markets. Similar patterns were seen before the big crashes in the US and Japan from 1929 and 1989. Slow growth, weaker trade due to tariffs, and falling prices in oil and Chinese bonds are all adding to the pressure. At the same time, Bitcoin is no longer moving with stocks and other risk assets like it used to. While gold is climbing, both Bitcoin and equities are struggling. Investors are realizing that crypto ETFs act more like high-risk assets than safe havens. A spike in the gold-to-silver ratio above 100, often seen before recessions, is adding to the cautious mood. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : $69K Is the Key, Cowen Maps Out Bitcoin’s Next Big Move , How Low Can Bitcoin Price Go? McGlone explains that if the S&P drops to 4,000, historical correlations and market profiles indicate Bitcoin could revert to pre-pandemic average levels, around $10,000. This aligns with Bitcoin’s 200-week exponential moving average and long-term fair value zones. He also references Bloomberg’s proprietary Bitcoin driver index, suggesting current fundamentals point to a sub-$17K valuation. Bitcoin Price Crash Unlikely Unless $69K Breaks Altcoin Daily analyst, however, provides a more hopeful view. While acknowledging the risk of a return to $20K in a severe recession, they argue that Bitcoin has shown resilience during recent corrections. It didn’t retest old highs despite a 10% drop in the S&P. With global liquidity now at an all-time high, thanks to rate cuts and QE outside the U.S., the odds of a massive collapse seem lower. Unless Bitcoin breaks below $69K convincingly, the analyst believes new lows are unlikely. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

43518867,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=150891,1745046007,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Crypto Alert: Fear & Greed Index Signals Continued Market Anxiety at 32,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-fear-greed-index-anxiety/,"Are you feeling uneasy about the recent dips in the crypto market? You’re not alone. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, a key indicator of market sentiment, has just dropped another point, landing at 32. This persistent ‘Fear’ reading suggests that market participants are still feeling the pressure. But what exactly does this mean for your crypto portfolio, and how should you navigate these uncertain waters? Let’s dive into the details and understand what the Crypto Fear and Greed Index is telling us. Decoding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: What’s Behind the Numbers? The Crypto Fear and Greed Index , developed by Alternative.me, isn’t just a random number; it’s a comprehensive gauge of market emotions. It operates on a scale from 0 to 100, where: 0-25: Extreme Fear – This zone typically indicates a potential buying opportunity as assets might be undervalued due to excessive panic. 26-49: Fear – Signifies that investors are cautious and apprehensive about the market. 50-75: Greed – Suggests growing optimism and a willingness to invest, potentially leading to market rallies. 76-100: Extreme Greed – This zone can be a warning sign of a market bubble, as excessive exuberance might drive prices to unsustainable levels. Currently, with the index at 32, we are firmly in the ‘Fear’ zone. But what factors contribute to this reading? The index isn’t based on gut feelings; it’s calculated using a weighted average of six distinct market indicators: Factor Weight Description Volatility 25% Measures the current and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin, comparing it with the average values over the last 30 and 90 days. Unusual volatility can indicate fear in the market. Market Momentum/Volume 25% Compares the current market momentum and trading volume to the past 30 and 90-day averages. High buying volumes in a positive market signal greed, while low volumes in a negative market can suggest fear. Social Media Sentiment 15% Analyzes sentiment trends on social media platforms, particularly Twitter, related to cryptocurrency hashtags. High positive interaction rates indicate greed, while negative or low interaction suggests fear. Surveys 15% Weekly crypto surveys gauge investor sentiment. While currently paused, historically, survey results have been a direct measure of fear or greed in the crypto community. Bitcoin Dominance 10% Measures Bitcoin’s dominance compared to the broader crypto market. Increased Bitcoin dominance often arises from fear, as investors may shift towards the perceived safety of Bitcoin during market downturns. Google Trends 10% Analyzes Google Trends data for Bitcoin-related search queries. Increased search interest can indicate growing curiosity or fear of missing out (FOMO), while declining interest might suggest fear or disinterest. Why Does Market Sentiment Matter for Your Crypto Investments? Understanding market sentiment , as reflected by the Fear & Greed Index, is crucial for making informed investment decisions. Here’s why: Identifying Potential Buying Opportunities: Periods of extreme fear can often present excellent buying opportunities. When everyone else is panicking and selling, asset prices may be driven down to undervalued levels. Contrarian investors often see ‘fear’ as a green light to accumulate assets at a discount. Avoiding Market Tops: Conversely, extreme greed can signal an overheated market that’s ripe for a correction. Recognizing excessive optimism can help investors take profits and reduce risk before a potential downturn. Gauging Market Psychology: The index provides a snapshot of the overall emotional state of the crypto market. It helps you understand whether the prevailing mood is one of optimism or pessimism, which can significantly influence price movements. Informed Decision Making: By considering the Fear & Greed Index alongside other fundamental and technical analysis tools, you can make more balanced and less emotionally driven investment choices. Navigating the ‘Fear’ Zone: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, the market sentiment is currently fearful. What should you do? Here are some actionable insights to consider: Review Your Portfolio: Assess your current crypto holdings. Are you comfortable with your risk exposure in a fearful market? Consider rebalancing your portfolio if necessary. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): In a ‘Fear’ zone, DCA can be a prudent strategy. Instead of trying to time the market bottom, invest a fixed amount at regular intervals. This approach helps to average out your purchase price over time. Due Diligence & Research: Fear can sometimes be irrational. Use this time to conduct thorough research on projects you are interested in. Focus on fundamentals, technology, and long-term potential rather than short-term price fluctuations. Stay Calm and Avoid Panic Selling: Emotional decisions are often detrimental in investing. Resist the urge to sell your assets based solely on fear. Remember that market cycles are normal, and downturns can be followed by periods of recovery and growth. Monitor the Index Regularly: Keep an eye on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and how it evolves over time. It’s a dynamic indicator that can provide valuable insights into shifting market sentiment. Crypto Volatility and the Fear Factor: A Constant Companion Crypto volatility is inherent to the cryptocurrency market. It’s what makes crypto both exciting and nerve-wracking. High volatility contributes significantly to fear in the market. When prices swing wildly, uncertainty increases, and investors become more risk-averse. The Fear & Greed Index often spikes during periods of high volatility, reflecting this increased anxiety. However, it’s crucial to remember that volatility also presents opportunities. Experienced traders and investors can capitalize on volatility by buying low during fearful dips and selling higher during periods of greed-driven rallies. Understanding and managing risk associated with crypto volatility is a key skill for navigating the crypto market successfully. Bitcoin Dominance : A Flight to Safety? The Bitcoin dominance metric, a component of the Fear & Greed Index, offers another layer of insight. Historically, during periods of market fear, Bitcoin dominance tends to increase. This is often attributed to a ‘flight to safety’ phenomenon. When uncertainty grips the market, investors may move their capital from altcoins, perceived as riskier, back into Bitcoin, the oldest and most established cryptocurrency. While increased Bitcoin dominance can indicate market fear, it can also signal a potential shift in market dynamics. Monitoring Bitcoin dominance alongside the Fear & Greed Index can provide a more nuanced understanding of investor behavior and market trends. Conclusion: Navigating Crypto Market Sentiment with Confidence The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, currently lingering in the ‘Fear’ zone at 32, serves as a timely reminder of the emotional rollercoaster that is the cryptocurrency market. While fear can be unsettling, understanding its drivers and implications empowers you to make more rational investment decisions. By monitoring market sentiment, employing strategic approaches like dollar-cost averaging, and focusing on long-term fundamentals, you can navigate these periods of uncertainty with greater confidence and potentially capitalize on opportunities that fear-driven markets may present. Remember, informed decisions, not emotional reactions, are the cornerstone of successful crypto investing.

BTC’s ‘Next Big Move’ Could Come Next Week",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-ready-to-reclaim-90000-btcs-next-big-move-could-come-next-week/,"Amid the market volatility, Bitcoin (BTC) has been unable to reclaim the $85,000-$86,000 zone despite its weekly performance. However, some analysts suggest that a breakout from the key resistance level might be around the corner. Related Reading: On-Chain Experiment Or Rug Pull? Base Faces Backlash After Unofficial Memecoin Crashes 90% Bitcoin To Resume Its Bullish Rally? Over the past week, Bitcoin has traded between the $83,000-$86,000 price range, recovering from the sub-$80,000 correction at the start of the month. Notably, the flagship crypto experienced significant volatility last week due to the ongoing trade tariff war between the US and dozens of countries. BTC’s recent recovery began after the US President Donald Trump paused the tariff on over 75 countries for 90 days, which sent BTC’s price back above the $80,000 mark. Amid the volatility, Bitcoin retested the key $78,500 as support and its four-month downtrend resistance, compressing between these two levels. According to market watcher Daan Crypto Trades, Bitcoin has been moving within a significant area, as it was retesting its downtrend line as well as the Daily 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and Moving Average (MA), which “has been a tough price region to crack in recent weeks.” Amid Thursday’s pump, BTC is finally breaking out of its downtrend, which could lead to a surge toward the “ultimate level to break for the bulls,” the $90,000-$91,000 barrier, as he suggested that the sideways move in the mid-$80,000 region won’t continue for much longer. Nonetheless, the trader considers that the coming days might not have significant swings due to the Easter weekend, with low volumes and liquidity expected. “Likely going to be quite boring absent any major new headlines,” he asserted, adding that “we’ll see where this wants to go next week.” BTC’s Key Levels To Reclaim Analyst Sjuul from AltCryptoGems pointed out that Bitcoin is trapped below the 50-day EMA, which is “what separated us from a bull run resumption.” He explained that the cryptocurrency has been moving between $78,000-$95,000 since March, with the 50 EMA coinciding with the price range’s mid-zone and seemingly acting as resistance for the past week. Breaking out of the mid-range, between $85,000-$86,000 levels, could send BTC’s price above the $90,000 mark and toward the range’s high. Related Reading: Aptos (APT) To Continue Moving In ‘No Man’s Land’ – Can It Reclaim $5? According to the post, Bitcoin’s current price action resembles May 2021’s performance, before the bull run resumed. At the time, BTC reclaimed the 50 EMA on the daily chart, which “right now, just as back then, (…) has been the line in the sand between the bull and bear markets.” The analyst explained that strong spot buying pressure is necessary to break this resistance and resume BTC’s rally. “Should we finally have this spot buying pressure, and should we finally see the EMA 50 Daily being flipped, all you want next is for that liquidity wall at $87K to be properly broken,” he concluded. As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $84,521, a 1.2% increase in the weekly timeframe.

The analyst, pseudonymously known as the Flow Horse, tells his 267,200 followers on the social media platform X that he believes Bitcoin will revisit price levels below $80,000. But the trader says the current Bitcoin bounce could take BTC above $90,000 before his expected leg down ensues. “Think BTC definitely visit $70,000s again. Think a good trade that I would almost certainly sell is if price can remain bid at $88,000. That probably takes us to mid-$90,000s. There is a running diagonal, and a couple of moving averages that everyone is looking at. Momentum opportunities exist on the other side.” The trader also highlights that if President Trump somehow manages to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, it would be catastrophic for risk assets like Bitcoin and crypto. “Given Trump’s language, if by some measure he is able to boot Powell (Think this might be impossible, but man, clown world right now..) markets nuke.” The Flow Horse also says he has zero exposure to Bitcoin or equities and thinks that the current rallies will be short-lived. “Thinking the trend is your friend and rallies are for selling still.” Bitcoin is trading at $84,490 at time of writing.

43519222,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=150894,1745046624,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bold Move: Japanese Fashion Brand ANAP Doubles Down on Bitcoin Investment,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/anap-fashion-bitcoin-investment/,"In a bold move signaling growing institutional interest in digital assets, Japanese fashion powerhouse ANAP Holdings, the parent company of popular clothing brand ANAP, has significantly increased its Bitcoin holdings. This strategic allocation of capital into cryptocurrency highlights a fascinating intersection of the fashion world and the burgeoning digital economy. But what exactly does this mean, and why is a fashion brand investing in Bitcoin? Let’s dive into the details of ANAP’s Bitcoin investment and explore the wider implications of this intriguing development. ANAP’s Strategic Bitcoin Investment: A Closer Look According to a report by CoinPost, ANAP Holdings has committed approximately 200 million yen to acquire Bitcoin. This substantial Bitcoin investment translates to 16.6591 BTC, purchased at a price of 199.975 million yen. These digital assets will be managed by ANAP Lightning Capital, a subsidiary focused on exploring new financial frontiers. This move isn’t ANAP’s first foray into the crypto space. They previously invested in Bitcoin in 2022, showcasing a sustained belief in the long-term potential of cryptocurrencies. This recent acquisition further solidifies their position as a forward-thinking company embracing digital innovation. Investment Details Value Currency Invested Japanese Yen (JPY) Amount Invested 200 Million JPY (Approx.) Bitcoin Acquired 16.6591 BTC Managing Subsidiary ANAP Lightning Capital Why is a Fashion Brand Investing in Bitcoin? You might be wondering, what’s the connection between trendy clothing and cryptocurrency? For ANAP, this Bitcoin investment likely represents a multi-faceted strategy driven by several key factors: Diversification of Assets: Companies often seek to diversify their holdings to mitigate risk and explore new growth opportunities. Bitcoin, as a nascent asset class, offers diversification beyond traditional financial instruments. Hedge Against Inflation: Bitcoin is often touted as a hedge against inflation due to its limited supply. In an environment of economic uncertainty, companies may look to Bitcoin to preserve the value of their assets. Embracing Technological Innovation: ANAP, as a fashion-forward brand, likely sees value in aligning itself with cutting-edge technologies. Investing in Bitcoin can be viewed as a statement of innovation and adaptability in a rapidly evolving digital landscape. Potential for Future Integration: While not explicitly stated, ANAP might be exploring future integrations of cryptocurrency into its business model. This could involve accepting Bitcoin as payment, exploring blockchain for supply chain management, or even venturing into metaverse fashion experiences. The Rise of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption in Japan ANAP’s move is part of a broader trend of increasing institutional Bitcoin adoption , particularly in Japan. Japan has been relatively progressive in its regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies, recognizing Bitcoin as legal property and establishing frameworks for crypto exchanges. This regulatory clarity has fostered a more welcoming environment for businesses to explore and adopt digital assets. Several factors contribute to Japan’s growing crypto adoption: Tech-Savvy Population: Japan has a high level of technological literacy and a strong interest in innovation, making it fertile ground for crypto adoption. Forward-Thinking Regulatory Environment: As mentioned, Japan’s proactive regulatory stance provides businesses with the confidence to engage with cryptocurrencies. Economic Factors: Historically, periods of economic stagnation in Japan have led some investors to seek alternative assets, potentially contributing to interest in Bitcoin. Cultural Acceptance: There seems to be a growing cultural acceptance of digital currencies and blockchain technology within Japan. Crypto Adoption Japan: Beyond Finance The story of crypto adoption Japan extends beyond just financial institutions. Companies across various sectors, from fashion like ANAP to gaming and technology, are exploring the potential of blockchain and cryptocurrencies. This indicates a broader understanding of the transformative power of digital assets, not just as investments but as tools to reshape industries and business models. Examples of crypto adoption in Japan beyond finance include: Gaming Industry: Japanese gaming giants are actively exploring blockchain gaming and NFTs, recognizing the potential for new revenue streams and enhanced player experiences. Supply Chain Management: Companies are investigating blockchain to improve transparency and efficiency in supply chains, tracking goods and ensuring authenticity. Digital Identity Solutions: Blockchain-based digital identity solutions are being explored for various applications, from secure authentication to streamlined administrative processes. Metaverse and Web3 Initiatives: Japanese companies are increasingly engaging with metaverse and Web3 technologies, with cryptocurrencies playing a crucial role in these decentralized digital worlds. What Does This Mean for the Future of Bitcoin and Fashion? ANAP’s Bitcoin fashion brand investment could be a bellwether, signaling a potential trend of more fashion and retail brands embracing cryptocurrencies. As digital natives become a dominant consumer demographic, and as the metaverse and Web3 gain traction, the integration of crypto into the fashion industry could become increasingly relevant. Imagine purchasing virtual clothing for your avatar with Bitcoin, or brands leveraging NFTs for exclusive merchandise and loyalty programs. The possibilities are vast and still largely untapped. Potential Benefits for Fashion Brands Adopting Crypto: Reaching New Customer Segments: Tapping into the crypto-savvy demographic can expand customer reach. Enhanced Brand Image: Positioning as innovative and forward-thinking. New Revenue Streams: Exploring NFTs, metaverse fashion, and crypto payments. Improved Customer Loyalty: Utilizing crypto-based loyalty programs and rewards. Challenges and Considerations: Volatility of Crypto Markets: Bitcoin’s price fluctuations present a risk. Regulatory Uncertainty: While Japan is progressive, regulations globally are still evolving. Consumer Education: Educating customers about crypto payments and related technologies is necessary. Security Concerns: Ensuring the security of crypto transactions and holdings is paramount. Actionable Insights: Is Bitcoin Right for Your Business? While ANAP’s move is noteworthy, every business needs to carefully consider whether Bitcoin investment or crypto adoption aligns with its specific goals and risk tolerance. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Conduct Thorough Research: Understand Bitcoin, blockchain technology, and the regulatory landscape in your region. Assess Your Risk Appetite: Crypto markets are volatile; evaluate your comfort level with potential price swings. Start Small and Learn: Consider a pilot project or small-scale investment to gain experience. Seek Expert Advice: Consult with financial advisors and crypto specialists. Focus on Long-Term Strategy: Crypto adoption is a long-term game; align it with your overall business strategy. Conclusion: A Glimpse into the Future of Commerce ANAP’s deepened commitment to Bitcoin is more than just a financial decision; it’s a powerful statement about the evolving relationship between traditional industries and the digital asset world. It highlights the growing institutional Bitcoin adoption and the expanding reach of cryptocurrency beyond the realm of finance. As more companies like ANAP explore the potential of Bitcoin and blockchain, we can expect to see even more innovative integrations and applications emerge, blurring the lines between the physical and digital worlds and shaping the future of commerce in exciting and unexpected ways. This strategic move by a fashion-forward brand like ANAP may just be the beginning of a fascinating new chapter in the story of Bitcoin and its integration into mainstream industries.

Dogecoin price may reach a maximum of $1.07 in 2025. With a potential surge, the DOGE price may achieve its $3 mark in 2030. Dogecoin, the memecoin category leader, has picked up the pace amidst the uptrend in the market. Between the turn of events, marketers are still hoping for it to match its June 2021 high. The hopes could soon be fulfilled, as the House of Doge within the Dogecoin Foundation has opened the doors to the “Official Dogecoin Reserve” by acquiring 10 million DOGE to boost payment utility and transaction efficiency. Talking about DOGE’s price, it is currently holding onto its support/resistance at $0.1587, a bullish push from here could lead DOGE to its resistance at $0.17. On the flipside, if bears hunt DOGE down, its price could tumble to $0.15 in the very short term. As the underlying dynamics shift amid broader market volatility, investors have started wondering, “Will Dogecoin reach $1?” to “Will Dogecoin go up?” Are you wondering the same? Worry not, Coinpedia’s Dogecoin price prediction 2025 to 2030 will clear all such doubts. Look at this well-researched and detailed DOGE price prediction for the upcoming moves.

That’s not all, Dogecoin witnessed an impressive 400% spike in its active addresses, hinting at growing network activity. If the FOMO around Dogecoin continues to grow and if influencers promote the coin, then its price could reach $1.07 . However, if Dogecoin cannot maintain its current growth rate, its price will likely average out at $0.84 in a highly competitive market. On the other hand, if Dogecoin fails to stay relevant in 2025, the price of DOGE can plunge to a low of $0.62 .

On the other hand, if the market is hit again by external forces like regulations or negative statements by influencers. Hence, the meme coin might trade at a potential low of $ 0.62 . We expect the DOGE price to reach a new swing high of $1.07 by the end of 2025. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $0.62 $0.84 $1.07 Can DOGE Break the $1 Barrier? Given DOGE’s success, largely driven by hype with some technical progress, crossing $1 by 2025 remains a realistic possibility. A sustained media frenzy and growing endorsement deals could maintain bullish momentum. Expanded merchant adoption would also strengthen confidence in its long-term viability. Dogecoin’s Tokenomics and Long-Term Outlook The future of Dogecoin hinges on its utility. Meme popularity alone may not sustain it indefinitely, but advancements in transaction fees, speed, and business collaborations could help it thrive as a mainstream digital currency. Its large and passionate community will likely continue to drive positive evolution. Conclusion Given Dogecoin’s past price behavior, driven largely by online hype and media coverage, it has the potential to reach over $1 in 2025. DOGE has shown remarkable resilience, and key factors like expanded merchant adoption, community growth, and protocol upgrades could enhance its viability.

These tokens have become staples in the digital asset space, each with its own crowd and track record. But with so much of their value already priced in, some traders are beginning to wonder if newer, less exposed projects might offer a more compelling growth trajectory this time around. One token now gaining traction is Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is currently priced at just $0.025 and quietly building out real DeFi infrastructure ahead of its official launch. Legacy Tokens: The Hype and the Ceiling Dogecoin was never meant to be taken seriously at first—but that didn’t stop it from delivering eye-watering returns. Initially powered by memes and community sentiment, DOGE shot to fame and made headlines as it reached double-digit billion-dollar market caps. However, in recent months, it’s been trading sideways, and many long-time holders are questioning whether DOGE can replicate its past performance without new use cases to back it up. Cardano, in contrast, adopted a research-driven and methodical development strategy. It’s known for its peer-reviewed development process and long-term roadmap focused on scalability and governance. ADA has earned credibility in the market and has built a loyal following. Yet despite the research-heavy ethos, its growth has slowed, and it faces stiff competition from newer blockchains that are offering faster throughput and broader DeFi integration. For both DOGE and ADA, growth from this point forward will likely be more gradual—and heavily tied to broad market sentiment. Enter Mutuum Finance: Early Price, Real Utility While many established projects navigate maturing ecosystems, Mutuum Finance is just beginning to open its doors. As a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol, Mutuum is introducing mechanisms that deliver clear value to users from day one. The project is still in its presale phase, allowing early participants to purchase MUTM at just $0.025—a fraction of what many expect the token to reach post-launch. So far, the project has raised over $6.8 million and onboarded more than 8,300 holders. What makes Mutuum different isn’t just the low entry point—it’s the utility that’s actively being developed behind the scenes. The team has announced plans to roll out a beta version of its lending platform by the time the token goes live. That means the token will have real usage and functionality on day one, avoiding the speculative-only hype that often surrounds new listings. Mutuum’s lending model is structured around both peer-to-peer and peer-to-contract interactions. Users can supply assets to liquidity pools and earn passive returns or negotiate custom terms directly with other participants. The inclusion of volatile assets like DOGE and SHIB in its P2P layer shows that Mutuum isn’t shying away from broader market trends—it’s integrating them into a more structured, income-generating system. The mtToken system is a core component of Mutuum’s long-term vision. When users supply assets to the platform, they’re issued mtTokens—ERC-20 tokens that continuously gather interest as long as the deposit remains active. These tokens can be redeemed for the original deposit plus interest or used within other DeFi applications. Even more compelling is the platform’s buy-and-distribute mechanism. A portion of revenue generated by the protocol is used to purchase MUTM tokens from the open market. These tokens are then redistributed to users who hold mtTokens, encouraging long-term participation and applying constant buy pressure that can support price growth. The platform is also building an overcollateralized stablecoin. This feature will create more ways for users to access liquidity without exiting positions, adding further stickiness to the ecosystem and widening MUTM’s utility far beyond basic lending. Mutuum Finance may be new to the crypto scene, but the groundwork being laid today positions it to be one of the top cryptocurrencies to watch as the market heats up. Unlike DOGE and ADA, which are largely reliant on momentum or macro updates, MUTM’s growth is tied to its ongoing rollout and expanding use cases. Early price access, platform development, and built-in yield systems make it more than just another speculative asset. When the token reaches even $2 by the end of 2025—a projection many believe is realistic given the mechanics in place—that would represent an 80x return from today’s entry. That’s the kind of asymmetric opportunity that early investors are always looking for. In a space where timing and utility matter more than ever, MUTM stands out not just for where it is today, but for what it’s actively building. As the market shifts focus from legacy tokens to those offering functional value, Mutuum Finance looks increasingly like a strong candidate for long-term growth.

This is the highest it has ever been, showing that more money is now circulating in China’s economy than ever before. Experts believe that this boast could impact Bitcoin price surging it to $90k. China’s M2 Surges to $326 Trillion Money M2 is a measure of a country’s total money supply. It includes cash, savings, and easily accessible deposits. When M2 rises , it usually means the government is pumping more liquidity into the system, which can make borrowing easier and spending or investing more active. New data shows that China’s M2 money supply has reached an all-time high of $326 trillion. Experts say this kind of liquidity can boost riskier assets like Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies, stocks, and real estate. So, the more cash there is, the more chance people might buy crypto, which can push prices up. Popular crypto analyst Kong Trading suggests that, “ China money printers are back on. Risk assets are about to go parabolic.” China’s M2 money supply just hit ¥326 TRILLION. The money printers are back on. Risk assets are about to go parabolic. pic.twitter.com/i2GsTWSFYB — Kong Trading (@KongBTC) April 17, 2025 In simple words, when there’s more money in the system, prices of riskier investments like crypto might start shooting up. Bitcoin Could Hit $90K Soon According to Brickken analyst Enmanuel Cardozo D’Armas, if China’s M2 money supply continues to grow, Bitcoin might soon test the $90,000 mark. As of now, Bitcoin is trading around $85,000 , reflecting a rise of 0.5% in the last 24 hours. Backing Enmanuel’s prediction, market expert and Chartered Market Technician (CMT) Aksel Kibar shared a similar view . He said that it’s very important for Bitcoin to stay above its year-long average price to keep its upward trend strong. He also said that $90,000 is a big level to watch. If Bitcoin goes above it, the price could start moving toward the next big goal, $100k. But Risks Still Remain While the outlook seems promising, analysts warn there are still uncertainties. A possible interest rate cut in the U.S. during May or June could help push crypto higher. But negative factors like stricter regulations or rising trade tensions could hold things back. Also, the end of Trump’s 90-day tariff pause will create massive volatility in the market.",News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-19 07:18:55

His comments were made during an appearance at CfC St. Moritz, a highly regarded and selective blockchain and digital asset conference. Crypto investor Xaif shared a clip from Garlinghouse’s appearance alongside a summary that read: “Brad Garlinghouse: Ripple doesn’t need to raise capital. There’s no IPO in 2025 — we haven’t needed outside funding. #XRP. Strong signal: Ripple is self-sustaining and focused on building, not begging.” 💥BREAKING 💥 Brad Garlinghouse: Ripple doesn’t need to raise capital. There’s no IPO in 2025 — we haven’t needed outside funding. #XRP Strong signal: Ripple is self-sustaining and focused on building, not begging. pic.twitter.com/3NMNKDCffa — 𝕏aif🇮🇳|🇺🇸 (@Xaif_Crypto) April 17, 2025 The post reflects growing recognition of Ripple’s position as a financially independent entity within the blockchain space, separate from the need for capital-raising through public markets. Garlinghouse: No Capital Need, No IPO In the video shared by Xaif, Garlinghouse addressed the topic of a potential IPO directly. He noted that most companies typically go public to raise capital. According to him, this has never been a necessity for Ripple. “The reality, most companies that go public do that to raise capital. We haven’t needed to raise capital. And so that has not been a driving force,” he said. Garlinghouse further elaborated on the nature of Ripple’s internal discussions about going public. While acknowledging that the idea has come up before, he stated that hostile regulatory conditions in the United States have contributed to the decision to hold back. He added, “We have talked a little bit about, would we go public? And, you know, it’s like, well, the US market until recently has been very hostile. And like, why would we even try to have that conversation?” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 No Timeline, No Pressure When pressed for a specific answer on whether an IPO could be expected soon, Garlinghouse responded, “I think that’s a definitive no.” He added that although 2025 has arrived, the time required to move toward a public offering simply hasn’t been part of Ripple’s current strategy. He emphasized that the company evaluates whether becoming a public company would benefit its operations and objectives. “You have to ask yourself, okay, how does Ripple benefit from being a public company? And, you know, therefore, is it a high priority for us?” he said. Garlinghouse did, however, leave the door open to reassessing this position if the regulatory environment in the U.S. changes. “As conditions change, you never say never and you re-evaluate,” he remarked, signaling that Ripple’s strategy could evolve depending on how the Securities and Exchange Commission and broader policy developments unfold. Xaif’s post and the attached video highlight Ripple’s consistent message: the company is well-capitalized, strategically cautious, and not driven by the need to seek capital through public markets. Garlinghouse’s comments are a clear stance that Ripple is focused on its operational goals in 2025, not an IPO. Ripple continues to operate as a private entity, with financial independence emphasized as a strength. If regulatory clarity in the U.S. improves, the company may revisit the conversation, but according to Garlinghouse, there are no current or imminent plans to proceed with a public listing.

Crypto enthusiasts are buzzing as BTC has decisively broken above its 50-day Moving Average (MA) – a key technical indicator watched closely by traders and analysts alike. This breakthrough , as highlighted by renowned crypto investor Scott Melker, marks the first time in months that Bitcoin has closed a daily candle above this crucial level. Could this be the signal of a hopeful trend reversal we’ve all been waiting for? Let’s dive into a detailed Bitcoin price analysis to understand what this move means for the future of BTC and the broader crypto market outlook . Decoding the Bitcoin 50-Day Moving Average Breakout For those new to technical analysis, the 50-day Moving Average (MA) is a line on a price chart representing the average closing price of an asset over the past 50 days. It’s a popular tool used to smooth out price fluctuations and identify trends. When the price of an asset crosses above its 50-day MA, it’s often seen as a bullish signal, suggesting potential upward momentum. Scott Melker, a respected voice in the crypto space, pointed out this significant development on X, noting the daily close above the 50-day MA. But what exactly does this mean for Bitcoin? Potential Short-Term Trend Reversal: Breaking above the 50-day MA can indicate that the short-term downtrend might be losing steam, and a shift towards an uptrend could be forming. This is because the price is now consistently trading above its average price for the last 50 days, suggesting growing buying pressure. Increased Investor Confidence: Such a breakout can boost investor confidence. Traders who use technical analysis might interpret this as a signal to enter long positions, further driving up demand and potentially the price. Confirmation Needed: However, it’s crucial to remember that a single indicator isn’t a foolproof predictor. As Melker himself mentioned, the breakout occurred on relatively low volume. This is a key point to consider. Low Volume Concerns: Is This a False Signal? The elephant in the room is the low volume accompanying this BTC breakout . Volume in trading refers to the number of shares or contracts traded in a given period. High volume breakouts are generally considered more reliable because they indicate strong conviction and broad market participation. Low volume breakouts, on the other hand, can be less convincing and potentially short-lived. Why is low volume a concern? Lack of Strong Conviction: Low volume suggests that while the price has moved up, it hasn’t been driven by a large number of participants. This could mean the move is less sustainable and more susceptible to pullbacks. Potential for Manipulation: In markets with lower liquidity, price movements on low volume can sometimes be manipulated, or simply be the result of a few large orders rather than widespread buying interest. Need for Further Confirmation: Due to the low volume, traders and investors should be cautious and look for further confirmation signals before concluding that a strong trend reversal is underway. So, while the 50-day MA breakout is encouraging, the low volume warrants a degree of skepticism. It’s like seeing a flicker of light at the end of a tunnel – promising, but you need to see more than just a flicker to be sure it’s daylight. Key Resistance Levels and the Path to New Highs Even with the 50-day MA hurdle cleared, Bitcoin faces significant resistance ahead. The most crucial levels to watch are the 200-day Moving Average and the $88,804 price level. Let’s break down why these levels are so important in this Bitcoin price analysis : Resistance Level Significance What it Means for Bitcoin 200-day Moving Average (MA) Long-term trend indicator. Often acts as a strong resistance or support level. Breaking above the 200-day MA would be a major bullish signal, indicating a potential shift from a long-term downtrend to an uptrend. It’s a tougher resistance to crack than the 50-day MA. $88,804 Level Previous all-time high price level. Psychological resistance. Surpassing the all-time high would confirm a new market cycle and generate significant bullish momentum. This is the ultimate goal for Bitcoin bulls aiming for new highs. To confirm a truly robust trend reversal and potentially reach new market highs, Bitcoin needs to decisively break through both the 200-day MA and the $88,804 resistance level. This would require a significant influx of buying pressure and sustained volume. Until these levels are conquered, the current breakout should be viewed with cautious optimism. Navigating the Crypto Market Outlook: Actionable Insights So, what should crypto investors and traders do with this information? Here are some actionable insights to consider as we navigate the current crypto market outlook : Monitor Volume: Keep a close eye on trading volume in the coming days. A sustained increase in volume alongside continued price appreciation would strengthen the bullish case. Watch Key Resistance Levels: Pay close attention to how Bitcoin behaves around the 200-day MA and the $88,804 level. A strong push through these levels would be a very positive sign. Diversify and Manage Risk: Even with positive signals, the crypto market remains volatile. Diversification and prudent risk management are always essential. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with the latest market news and analysis from reputable sources. Market sentiment can change quickly in the crypto world. Conclusion: Cautious Optimism for Bitcoin’s Future Bitcoin’s break above the 50-day Moving Average is undoubtedly an encouraging sign, hinting at a potential trend reversal . However, the low volume and significant resistance levels ahead mean we’re not out of the woods yet. The market is at a crucial juncture. While there’s reason for cautious optimism, it’s essential to remain vigilant, monitor market developments closely, and make informed decisions based on a comprehensive understanding of both technical indicators and broader market dynamics. The journey to new Bitcoin highs, if that’s indeed the path ahead, will require overcoming significant hurdles. But for now, the 50-day MA breakout offers a glimmer of hope in the ever-exciting world of cryptocurrency.

At the beginning of April, gold was trading at $3,114. However, volatility struck early in the month. Between April 3 and 7, as global markets reacted to President Trump’s aggressive tariff policies, gold dropped by over 4.77%. A 90-day pause in tariff implementation brought relief. From April 9 to April 16, the gold market rebounded strongly, surging more than 12%. Bitcoin Bull Run Tied to Gold? Crypto analysts like Joe Consorti are now watching gold’s rally closely. Consorti believes Bitcoin follows gold’s directional trends with a delay of 100 to 150 days. His claim isn’t without precedent. In 2017, gold surged by 30% just months before Bitcoin climbed to $19,120. Similarly, in 2020, gold hit $2,075 before Bitcoin peaked at $69,000 in 2021. These past patterns suggest BTC may again be preparing for a major rally following gold’s breakout. Bitcoin Price Today and What’s Next According to coinpedia markets , Bitcoin is currently trading at $84,951.59. Over the past year, BTC has gained 36.9%. In April alone, it has grown about 3%. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 52.62, signaling neutral momentum. While 2025 has been volatile for Bitcoin, with a 17.5% drop in February and 2.19% in March, April appears more stable. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Price Prediction: How Low Can BTC Go in a Recession? , Analysts Forecast a Massive Bitcoin Bull Run Joe Consorti and others believe the real BTC rally will begin in Q3 or Q4 2025. Another analyst, Apsk32 , expects a breakout between July and November. A technical model using Bitcoin’s power curve time contour chart shows the potential for BTC to enter a parabolic phase in late 2025, with predictions reaching as high as $400,000. Final Thoughts With the gold price today setting new records, attention is shifting to Bitcoin. If historical patterns hold, a Bitcoin bull run may be closer than many expect. Investors are now watching for confirmation signals, and a surge above $100,000 could be the first sign that BTC is following gold’s lead once again. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

With HBAR currently trading near $0.15, a confirmed move above resistance could deliver serious upside. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also on analysts’ radars. MUTM has already raised over $6.9 million and has attracted more than 8400 holders within days. This could be your second chance at life-changing gains. Phase 5 prices will spike with 20% to $0.03 and holders joining at this stage stand a 140% ROI when it launches at $0.06. MUTM is building the kind of foundation that could match HBAR’s surge and reach $0.50 by year-end, delivering early investors massive gains. The Mutuum Finance team has unveiled a new dashboard with a leaderboard that ranks the top 50 holders, who will be rewarded with bonus tokens for staying in the top 50 positions. Mutuum Finance Presale Takes Off The decentralized finance (DeFi) market adopts Mutuum Finance because of its innovative crypto lending approach which has gained fast momentum. More than 8,400 investors have participated in the project’s unique approach through which they poured $6.9 million of capital. Phase 4 features a $0.025 token price with a brief entry period that ends when prices rise 20% because it marks the termination of early investment possibilities. Investors participating in the presale phase can get an enormous 140% ROI by purchasing the token at $0.06. The decentralized finance sector keeps expanding while Mutuum Finance emerges as the leading pioneer which brings innovative lending strategies and solid market leadership. Mutuum Finance utilizes CertiK to conduct an audit of their platform security which will receive publication on their social media channels afterwards. CertiK will audit the platform after completion before the official report gets published on their social media platforms for public transparency and trust. Shaking Up Crypto Lending through a Dual-Model Approach Mutuum Finance is redefining crypto lending by interweaving two dominant models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). The P2C model allows users to contribute stablecoins to liquidity pools managed by smart contracts, earning passive income with instant borrowing availability for platform players. Even interest rates are adjusted automatically by the smart contracts to maximize lenders’ returns and lower borrowing costs. The P2P model takes decentralization to the level of eliminating third parties, allowing borrowers and lenders to directly interact. This provides users with the option to negotiate individualized loan agreements, facilitating higher transparency and an intuitive borrowing experience. Through the Ethereum blockchain the platform stablecoin reaches price stability by using reserve-backed USD. The configuration works as a risk management system for algorithmic stablecoins to secure safe and reliable financial transactions. Mutuum Finance constructs the foundation of future decentralized finance by uniting emerging lending schemes with a solid infrastructure. The MUTM Giveaway As part of its community-building initiative, Mutuum Finance is running an engaging giveaway campaign, offering away $100,000 worth of MUTM tokens. Ten lucky users will receive $10,000 worth of tokens each. The new referral program for the platform also compensates users who bring in new investors. Users also receive access to exclusive staking pools, governance rights, and platform updates, encouraging long-term devotion and loyalty to the platform. Both Hedera (HBAR) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) show massive potential for significant gains. HBAR’s bullish bull pennant pattern suggests a breakout toward $0.50, while MUTM has raised over $6.9 million from more than 8,400 investors, with Phase 5 set to bring a 20% price spike. Early investors could see up to 140% ROI when the token launches at $0.06.

The accumulation trend among whales contrasts with the behavior of smaller holders. Investors holding less than 1-100 BTC have recently reduced their selling activity, potentially signaling a sentiment shift. Meanwhile, mid-sized holders holding 10-100 BTC are also showing signs of a shift from selling to buying, a development that could reflect increased optimism or a strategic re-entry into the market.

The firm notes that Short-Term Holders (STHs) are experiencing significant unrealized losses given the depth of the current correction. These levels are comparable to those observed in the early stages of previous bear markets. In contrast, Long-Term Holders (LTHs) remain largely in profit. However, Glassnode warns that the network’s capacity to absorb losses may increase as Bitcoin buyers at previous cycle peaks transition to LTH status. Historically, such transitions have often coincided with bear market confirmations, but analysts emphasize that current conditions do not yet point to a definitive market regime shift. *This is not investment advice.

The community-driven proposal suggests a notable decrease in staking rewards, aiming to adjust the annual yield for validators and delegators. This adjustment of reward yields from 7% to 3.79% in three months is seen as a strategic step to ensure the long-term sustainability and economic balance of the Aptos network. It will also align Aptos staking rewards with other layer-1 blockchains and encourage capital efficiency. Aptos proposal triggers debate over staking cuts and network decentralization The initiative has drawn attention to X, though early feedback on GitHub reveals some pushback. Community member ElagabalxNode cautioned that slashing rewards without “compensatory mechanisms like a robust delegation program” could sideline smaller validators, potentially undermining decentralization and long-term network resilience. As part of the proposal, MoonSheisty also suggested establishing a community validator program to offer grants and stake support to smaller contributors. Founded in 2021 by former Meta engineers, Aptos currently boasts a total value locked (TVL) of $974 million, according to DefiLlama. Of that, around $320 million comes from the lending protocol Aries Markets. While high staking rewards help attract participants to secure the network, the proposal argues that they may inadvertently steer users away from riskier, potentially more rewarding opportunities such as restaking MEV (maximal extractable value), DePIN infrastructure, and broader DeFi applications. Staking returns differ widely between networks. CoinLedger reports that BNB Smart Chain offers some of the highest real returns at 7.43%, while Cardano sits at the lower end with just 0.55%. Much like savings account interest payouts, staking aims to give users tokens for putting theirs to work by locking them up and supporting network validators. But the rewards—paid in crypto—can vary in fiat value. The Aptos proposal is one of a number of recent evaluations of staking dynamics among blockchains. In June 2024, Polkadot suggested reducing its time for unstaking to a mere two days. As of September, the Starknet community approved a new staking mechanism with a suggestion from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin to follow up on some things to overcome some of the challenges of staking. Staking grants users a meaningful role in network governance and security but also presents risks. Chief among them is the consolidation of staking power, which can centralize control and erode the decentralization blockchains strive to maintain. Aptos uses a staking system with epoch-based rewards Within the Aptos ecosystem, a staking system is utilized with ongoing epoch-based reward distribution. This structure guarantees that validators are incentivized according to their active participation in and contribution to the governance of the network. ​ Aptos has a governance model that permits community members (who meet the minimum staking requirement) to propose and vote on proposed changes. This dedication also serves the goal of a decentralized decision-making process through inclusiveness. ​ However, as the community grappled with the consequences of slashing staking rewards, conversations about similar compensatory mechanisms began to surface. Details of how a community validator program would work are still being proposed and discussed to support smaller validators or help with network decentralization.

The plan submitted by the member, MoonSheisty suggests lowering the rewards from 7% to 3.79% over the next three months. The plan aims to align Aptos with other Layer-1 blockchains and boost its capital efficiency. Although the proposal sparked discussions on X, the initial feedbacks on GitHub indicated some hesitation from the community. The proposal suggests that Aptos should create a community validator program to give grants and staking opportunities to the smaller validators who contribute to the ecosystem. Notably, according to data from Defilama, Aptos currently has a total value locked of $974 million as of April 18, where about $320 million comes from the lending protocol Aries Markets. However, ElagabalxNode, a community member noted that reducing the staking rewards without ‘compensatory mechanisms’ like a strong delegation program could drive away the smaller validators out of the network. This could impact Aptos blockchain’s decentralisation and its ability to stay strong in the long run. MoonSheisty claims that high staking rewards could prevent users from exploring opportunities involving high-risk and higher rewards like restaking, DePIN infrastructure, MEV, and Defi. Notably, Staking rewards differs significantly across blockchains as BNB Smart Chain’s real returns are one of the highest at 7.43%, while Cardano offers just 0.55%. Besides, benefits with staking include locking token onchain, supporting validators, securing the network. Notably, the rewards earned function similar to interest earned on a savings account, but instead of cash, stakers earn in crypto, which can fluctuate in value. The proposals to changing staking procedures are common. Polkadot had previously proposed to reduce the unstaking time to just two days. Further, in September, Starknet introduced a new staking mechanism. Meanwhile Vitalik Buterin suggested solutions to staking issues later.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|DOT|APT|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-19 07:51:01

Tariffs are taxes placed on imported goods by a government or a supranational union. Occasionally, tariffs can be applied to exports as well. They generate government revenue and serve as a trade regulation tool, often to shield domestic industries. Four main categories of tariffs are: Ad valorem tariffs: These are calculated as a percentage of the good’s value. For instance, a 20% tax might be placed on $100 of goods. Specific tariffs: These are fixed fees based on the quantity of goods. For example, there might be a tariff of $5 per imported kilogram of sugar. Compound tariffs: These combine a specific duty and an ad valorem duty applied to the same imported goods. Both tariffs are calculated together to determine the total tax. For example, a country might place a tariff on imported wine at $5 per liter plus 10% of the wine’s value. Mixed tariffs: Mixed tariffs apply either a specific duty or an ad valorem duty, based on predefined conditions. For instance, for imported trucks, a country might charge either $5,000 per vehicle or 15% of the car’s value, whichever is greater. The objective of such policy is to influence international trade flows, protect domestic industries, and respond to unfair practices by foreign countries. When a tariff is applied to an imported good, it raises its cost, making domestically produced alternatives more lucrative for customers regarding price. In the US, the Trump administration uses reciprocal tariffs as a key instrument in influencing the trade policies of other countries. Reciprocal tariffs are trade duties a country imposes in retaliation to tariffs or barriers set by another country. This policy seeks to correct trade imbalances and safeguard domestic industries. Tariffs are generally collected by the customs departments of a country at ports of entry based on the declared value and classification of goods. Did you know? Some countries use tariff-rate quotas, allowing a set quantity of a product to be imported at a lower tariff. Once the quota is exceeded, a higher tariff kicks in. This system balances domestic protection with access to global markets, especially in sectors like agriculture and textiles. Trump administration’s reciprocal tariff policy US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on April 2, 2025, a day he called Liberation Day, citing his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The order placed a minimum 10% tariff on all US imports effective April 5, 2025. Reciprocal tariffs went into effect on April 9, 2025. Trump stated that the US would apply reciprocal tariffs at roughly half the rate imposed by other countries. For instance, the US imposed a 34% tariff in response to China’s 67%. A 25% tariff on all automobile imports was also announced. The Trump administration’s reciprocal tariff policy is rooted in the belief that the US faced long-standing trade imbalances and unfair treatment by global trading partners. To address this, his administration pushed for what it called reciprocal tariffs, aiming at setting a tariff structure that matched or at least was close to tariffs that foreign nations imposed on American exports. Under this approach, the administration used tariff policies to pressure countries to lower their trade barriers or renegotiate trade deals. The policy drew support from domestic manufacturers and labor groups for attempting to rebalance trade and support the US industry. But it also sparked criticism from economists and international allies who viewed it as protectionist and destabilizing the prevalent economic system in the world. The reciprocal tariffs policy has reshaped US trade relations and marked a departure from decades of multilateral, open global trade policy. Did you know? Tariffs can reshape supply chains. To avoid high import taxes, companies often relocate manufacturing to countries with favorable trade agreements. This shift doesn’t always benefit consumers, as savings are not always passed down, and logistics become more complex. The US–China tariff war: A defining economic conflict The US–China tariff war, which began in 2018 under the first Trump administration, marked a significant shift in global economic relations. The conflict between the world’s two largest economies had broad implications for global supply chains , inflation and geopolitical dynamics. The trade conflict between the US and China wasn’t just a bilateral spat. It signaled a structural rethinking of trade policy in a multipolar world. The trade war began after the US imposed sweeping tariffs under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, citing unfair trade practices, intellectual property theft and forced technology transfers by China. Over time, the US levied tariffs on more than $360 billion worth of Chinese goods. China retaliated with tariffs on $110 billion of US exports, targeting key sectors like agriculture and manufacturing. The conflict disrupted major supply chains and raised costs for American businesses and consumers. American farmers were hit hard by retaliatory Chinese tariffs on soybeans, leading the US government to provide billions in subsidies to offset losses. While the Phase One Agreement in 2020 eased tensions and required China to increase purchases of US goods and enforce intellectual property protections, many tariffs remained in place. The Biden administration retained most of the economic measures imposed by the first Trump administration, signaling bipartisan concern over China’s trade practices. As of April 10, 2025, Trump had imposed 125% tariffs on China, while for 75 countries, he had paused the imposition of tariffs for 90 days. Compared to disputes with allies like the European Union or Canada, the stakes are higher in the US–China conflict, and the consequences are more far-reaching. Here are the responses of various governments to Trump’s tariffs: Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney implemented a 25% tariff on US-made cars and trucks. China will impose a 34% tariff on all US imports, effective April 10. The French prime minister described the tariffs as an economic catastrophe. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni criticized the tariffs as wrong. European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen pledged a unified response and prepared countermeasures. Taiwan’s government denounced the tariffs as unreasonable. How do tariffs work? When a tariff is applied — for example, a 30% tax on imported steel — it raises the price of that good for importers. They, in turn, pass these added costs to downstream businesses, which further transfer these costs to consumers. For importers, tariffs mean higher purchase costs. If a US company imports machinery from abroad and faces a tariff, its total cost increases. This possibly reduces its profit margins or forces it to search for alternatives. Exporters in other countries may suffer if US buyers reduce orders due to higher prices, hurting their competitiveness. Domestic producers may benefit initially from a high tariff regime. Tariffs can shield them from cheaper foreign competition, allowing them to increase sales and potentially make profits. But if their operations rely on imported components subject to tariffs, their input costs may rise, offsetting gains. Consumers often bear the brunt. Tariffs can lead to price hikes on everyday goods — from electronics to apparel. In the long term, high tariffs contribute to inflation and reduce purchasing power. Tariffs also disrupt global supply chains. Many products are assembled using components from multiple countries. High tariffs on one component can cause delays, prompt redesigns, or force companies to relocate manufacturing, increasing complexity and costs. Overall, while tariffs aim to protect domestic industries, their impact is felt across the economy through altering prices, trade flows and business strategies. One way or another, tariffs influence everyone — from factory owners to workers and everyday shoppers. Trump excluded various tech products, such as smartphones, chips, computers and certain electronics, from reciprocal tariffs, providing the tech sector with crucial relief from tariff pressure. This step of Trump eased pressure on tech stocks. Trump’s tariff announcement on April 2 triggered a sharp sell-off in both equities and Bitcoin ( BTC ), with BTC plunging 10.5% in a week. Once seen as a non-correlated asset, Bitcoin now trades in sync with tech stocks during macro shocks. According to analysts, institutional investors increasingly treat BTC as a risk-on asset closely tied to policy shifts. While some view Bitcoin as digital gold, recent behavior shows it reacting more like Nasdaq stocks — falling during global uncertainty and rallying on positive sentiment. Did you know? Tariff exemptions can be highly strategic. Governments may exclude specific industries or companies, allowing them to import goods tariff-free while competitors pay more. This creates an uneven playing field and can spark domestic controversy. Why do tariffs matter for global markets? Tariffs are a robust tool in the hands of governments to shape a nation’s economic and trade strategy. They are not merely taxes on imports but a tool that influences domestic production, consumer behavior and global trade relationships. For the US, tariffs have historically been used to assert economic power on the global stage, protect emerging industries, and respond to unfair trade practices. When countries with large economies are involved, tariff decisions can impact global supply chains, shift manufacturing hubs, and alter the price of goods worldwide. Even for the smaller countries, in an interconnected world, tariffs matter because their impact goes far beyond national borders. Domestically, tariffs could boost local industries by making foreign goods more expensive. This can create jobs and support economic resilience in the short term. Governments getting larger revenue via tariffs will enable them to reduce direct taxes as Trump proposed. But they can also raise prices for consumers, hurt exporters, and trigger retaliation from trade partners. As geopolitical tensions rise and nations reevaluate their economic dependencies, tariffs have reemerged as a central element of US trade policy. Whether used defensively or offensively, they shape the balance between protectionism and global engagement. This makes tariffs a matter not just of economics, but of national strategy and global influence. Who sets tariff policy in the US? In the US, tariff policy is shaped by a combination of legislative authority, executive power and administrative enforcement. Various agencies also help in the execution of tariff policy. Congress holds the constitutional authority to regulate trade and impose tariffs. Over time, Congress has given the president significant power to change tariffs for national security, economic threats or trade violations. The Office of the US Trade Representative plays a central role in formulating and negotiating US trade policy. It leads trade talks, manages disputes, and recommends tariff actions, often in coordination with the president and Congress. US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is responsible for enforcing tariffs at ports of entry. CBP collects duties based on the classification and value of imported goods according to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule. Several major trade laws have shaped tariff policy in the US. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, aimed at protecting US farmers during the Great Depression , led to retaliatory tariffs and worsened global trade. Later, the Trade Act of 1974 gave the president tools like Section 301, which was used extensively during the US–China trade war to impose retaliatory tariffs on unfair foreign practices. Together, these actors and laws form the foundation of US tariff policy. Criticism of Trump’s tariff policy Criticism of Trump’s tariff policy surfaced following the announcement of reciprocal tariffs. Critics say this move bypasses Congress and sets a dangerous precedent for unchecked executive power in economic matters. Detractors argue that these tariffs hurt American businesses more than their intended foreign targets. A Vox article argued that low-income people would be hit more by Trump’s tariffs than by the already reeling Wall Street. Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers fears that America may slip into recession due to tariffs, probably costing 2 million jobs nationwide. Legal challenges have also emerged regarding Trump’s tariff policy. The New Civil Liberties Alliance (NCLA), a conservative legal group, has filed a lawsuit on behalf of Simplified, a small business based in Florida that sells planners and sources goods from China. The lawsuit claims that the president overstepped his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) when imposing tariffs in a non-emergency trade context. Small and mid-sized businesses, many of which rely on global supply chains, will have to deal with rising import costs due to tariffs. This may lead to inflation and reduced competitiveness of such businesses. While the tariffs might hit China financially in the short term, the action could result in higher prices for US consumers and disrupt operations for American firms if the tariff policy continues for a long time.",,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-04-19 07:55:00

Source: Jesse Pollak It comes after criticism from several crypto industry participants who took to social media to voice their disappointment over Pollak’s endorsement of the image, calling out the use of the word “pimping.” Crypto commentator “Kristel” said in an April 18 X post, “so we’re just casually platforming pimping now?” “I get pushing boundaries, but this isn’t it,” she said. “This isn’t provocative and ‘edgy,” she added. Kanto Labs founder said it is an “absolute PR nightmare.” Meanwhile, crypto commentator David Z. Morris said this “doesn’t just hurt Base, it hurts crypto.” Morris added: “The specific allusion to sex trafficking (not “sex work,” pimping is pretty fundamentally exploitation) is specifically bad for a sector that needs to advance the narrative that open finance is a net social positive.” However, many praised Pollak for the apology and his continued efforts to push boundaries in the crypto industry. “Love the honesty. We all make mistakes, but it’s about how we grow from them,” crypto commentator Zuri said . Bankless co-founder David Hoffman said , “I respect the leadership here.” Milk Road co-founder Kyle Reidhead said , “Do and share whatever you want without apology.” Base was at the center of controversy only days ago when the official X account shared a post promoting a memecoin with its marketing tagline , “Base is for everyone.” Related: Base creator Jesse Pollak to join Coinbase exec team and lead wallet charge It also shared a link to a token of the same name on Zora, a social network where users can make posts into tokens for others to speculate on. In just over an hour after it was created, the Base is for everyone token hit a peak market capitalization of $17.1 million — then dropped by nearly 90% over the next 20 minutes to a market value of $1.9 million, according to DEX Screener data .

43522431,https://timestabloid.com/?p=64468,1745049991,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"XRP Price Prediction For April 19, 2025",https://timestabloid.com/xrp-price-prediction-for-april-19-2025/,"The daily chart of XRP reveals a classic falling wedge pattern, a well-known bullish reversal signal. This wedge has developed since January 2025, following XRP’s sharp rally from below $1 to highs above $3.50. Price action has since coiled within descending trendlines, forming lower highs and slightly lower lows. As of the latest candle, XRP is attempting to break out near the $2.07–$2.08 zone. A confirmed daily close above the wedge’s upper boundary would validate the breakout and suggest a shift toward a bullish continuation. Daily MACD: Reversal Momentum Emerging The daily MACD indicator adds weight to the bullish case. The MACD line is rising toward a crossover above the signal line, signaling a potential reversal. While the histogram remains flat, it’s transitioning from red to green, hinting at early bullish momentum. This development coinciding with the wedge breakout enhances its credibility. Notably, XRP has maintained structural support above $1.80, resisting deeper pullbacks despite prolonged consolidation. 4-Hour Chart: Breakout and Retest in Progress On the 4-hour chart, the breakout is clearer. XRP pierced the wedge resistance with a mild impulse and has since hovered above $2.07, reflecting a breakout-retest pattern. This is a typical behavior before trend continuation, especially after escaping a compression zone. A small consolidation or bullish flag appears to be forming just above the breakout level, which often precedes the next leg up . Holding above $2.06 strengthens the short-term bullish narrative. 4-Hour MACD: Strengthening Momentum The 4-hour MACD has already completed a bullish crossover. The histogram bars are turning greener, reflecting growing upward momentum. If volume accompanies the next push, XRP is likely to target the $2.15–$2.20 resistance band. This zone may act as an intraday magnet before any larger move. The $2.05–$2.07 range remains key support for intraday positioning and could serve as an ideal re-entry zone on dips.

This structure, defined by higher lows pressing against static resistance at $2.10–$2.11, suggests bullish pressure is mounting. A breakout above this range could trigger a swift rally. While volume is steady, a strong 1-hour close above $2.11, accompanied by volume, would likely confirm this pattern and catalyze an impulsive move. 1-Hour MACD: Bullish Continuation Setup The 1-hour MACD supports the triangle setup. The MACD line is positioned above the signal line, and histogram bars are gradually increasing. Although this timeframe is more volatile, when its signals align with the 4H and Daily MACD, it reinforces the broader bullish sentiment. Failure to hold $2.05 would undermine the short-term bullish outlook, but current conditions point to buyer control. Projection For Today: Targets and Trade Strategy The multi-timeframe alignment of bullish signals—falling wedge breakout , MACD crossovers, and intraday accumulation—suggests XRP is primed for upside continuation. Traders who entered near $2.07 can look to take profits at $2.15 (TP1) and $2.20 (TP2). If momentum surges beyond $2.20 with strong volume, a spike toward $2.30 (TP3) is achievable before the daily close. A stop-loss just below $2.02 is advisable to manage risk. As long as support holds and volume confirms, bulls maintain the edge for today’s session. Disclaimer: This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Google introduced forced reboot for Android. Trojan for Chinese smartphones stole over $1.6 million in cryptocurrencies. Vulnerabilities found in several Bitcoin wallets. Google introduced forced reboot for Android In the latest update of Google Play services, a function of automatic reboot for Android devices appeared. It will complicate data extraction using modern forensic tools. When the phone is turned on, it goes into the Before First Unlock state, in which most user data remains encrypted. But after the first unlock, in the After First Unlock (AFU) state, they become available for extraction. Thanks to the new feature, the device will automatically reboot if it remains inactive for 72 hours. Trojan for Chinese smartphones stole over $1.6 million in cryptocurrencies Dr.Web researchers reported preinstalled trojanized applications in budget copies of premium Android smartphone models from Samsung and Huawei. Among the modified programs are messengers WhatsApp and Telegram, QR code scanners, and others. The Shibai malware intercepts the app update process and also searches chats for Ethereum or Tron crypto wallet addresses and replaces them with fraudulent ones. In addition, it scans saved images for the presence of seed phrases. The attackers use about 30 domains to distribute malware and more than 60 command servers. Over the past two years, the wallets of the scheme organizers received over $1.6 million. Vulnerabilities found in several Bitcoin wallets Coinspect researchers discovered critical vulnerabilities in browser wallets Stellar Freighter, Frontier Wallet, and Coin98 that allow assets to be stolen unnoticed. To connect to dapps, browser wallets inject code into every tab visited by the user, establishing a communication channel. It allows the app to recognize the wallet and request access to key functions such as viewing balance or initiating transaction approval requests. Messages are transmitted to the Background Script, which has access to the private key. The final interaction takes place in the wallet interface. Unlike long-term connections that create separate channels for different parts of the extension, this approach does not have such separation. An attacker can intentionally cause confusion by sending a message to a privileged API through a listener in the background script. Malicious requests imitate legitimate ones and may lead to the display of the seed phrase for backup purposes. Experts have passed details about the vulnerability to the developers of each of the three wallets. So far, all have made the necessary fixes. 4chan shut down servers after major hack On April 14, the online forum 4chan was subjected to a serious attack and suspended operation . Members of the imageboard Soyjak.party took responsibility for the incident. Screenshots of the administrator and staff control panels, as well as a list of emails presumably belonging to the platform’s leaders and moderators, were leaked online. As Bleeping Computer writes , potential interception of maintenance tools gives hackers access to the location and IP address of any user, the ability to restart any 4chan boards, and manage databases. Later the same day, the forum’s source code appeared on Kiwi Farms. The alleged hackers did not disclose the attack vector. According to the community, the cause could be the platform’s outdated PHP version from 2016. To minimize damage, administrators presumably shut down the servers. At the time of writing, the site is unavailable. Darknet forum account owners offered to sell them anonymously Swiss cybersecurity company Prodaft announced the purchase of accounts from darknet forums. They are interested in accounts on XSS, Exploit, RAMP4U, Verified, and BreachForums registered before December 2022. Owners are guaranteed payment in cryptocurrency, with a higher amount for moderator or administrator accounts. The account must not be on the list of the most wanted by any law enforcement agencies. Also, as part of the initiative, users can anonymously report cybercrimes committed by someone. The deal is conducted anonymously using secure communication channels. Subsequently, the obtained data without seller information will be transferred to law enforcement for use in HUMINT operations and infiltration of closed cybercriminal communities. Reddit fulfilled only a quarter of Russia’s content removal requests The American platform Reddit received 122 content removal requests from government agencies and law enforcement of various countries in the second half of 2024. In particular, Russia sent 15 unique requests, of which the social network satisfied only four (26%). According to the report, less than a third of the requested content (27%) actually violated platform rules. Geoblocking was not applied in any case. The largest number of requests (24) was sent by the UAE authorities. In addition, a total of 27 legal requests turned out to be fake, about which Reddit notified law enforcement agencies.",News|Security,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-19 08:15:43

According to the online publication website, the move to report to the police was necessary following the impersonation of its digital publication to spread cryptocurrency scams. According to the website , the fraudulent website had published fabricated news containing claims that Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing had promoted cryptocurrency auto trading during a live television interview. The said article, which was dated April 17, featured several edited screenshots falsely claiming that Li had revealed making millions from crypto auto trading. A snapshot of the fraudulent website. Source: SCMP. The publication noted that the Hong Kong billionaire asserted in an interview with major Hong Kong television broadcaster TVB. As if the false claims were not enough, the fraudulent website used an online interface that looked like that of SCMP, making the claims look authentic to sway unsuspecting individuals into investing in the platform. SCMP reports fraudulent website pushing fake crypto investment interview According to a spokesperson from SCMP, the issue had since been escalated to the police. “We are aware of the situation and have reported it to the police,” an SCMP spokesman confirmed. The spokesperson also advised readers to be vigilant, urging them to avoid scams and phishing websites. They noted that readers should only ensure that they access news materials through the official website. Reports have shown that the real SCMP website did not post any news related to what the impostor website posted on April 17. A quick review of the TVB website also showed that there was no broadcast or interview from Li Ka-shing to that effect. TVB has also filed a police report regarding the fraudulent claims, asking the public to remain vigilant when reading news materials from unknown websites. The incident is just one of the many cases where scammers have used the credibility that some established media organizations have built over the years. They spun these fake websites, mimicking the original ones, to lure victims. According to reports, these scammers create articles that look realistic, using a false sense of urgency in their investments to drive users to put in their funds. Scammers tick up impersonation activities These types of scams are bigger than news, as these scammers even pretend to be influential figures on social media, mimicking them to lie about an investment or new token to scam unsuspecting victims. According to SCMP, these scammers infused huge efforts in trying to replicate the SCMP aesthetic. The platform noted that it shows the growing difficulty in trying to tell apart the real news platform from the fake ones. SCMP noted that the scammers copied the website well enough to fool readers who do not practice good digital hygiene, something it claims every reader should be able to adopt. Meanwhile, scammers have been trying to use the image and brand of Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing over the last few years. Ka-shing is well known in the country and the founder of CK Hutchison Holdings, as scammers have been using his likeness to perpetrate bad acts. Experts have also urged consumers to verify news outlets and the news they come across so that they can save themselves from these types of scam activities. They mentioned that users should be able to access information from the actual website after they have verified it, instead of accessing them through emails, messages, or social media. Also, experts have warned that scammers have ticked up their activities, with most of them using claims of exaggerated returns to sway users. In light of these, traders need to be careful, even as celebrity endorsements most time may even be a ploy to scam them.

A new survey reveals that 68% of Italian investors want their banks to offer Bitcoin and crypto services—marking a historic shift in public sentiment toward digital assets. With 24% of respondents already invested in crypto and another 29% planning to jump in soon, it’s clear that Italians are no longer waiting for banks to catch up—they're demanding it. The era of Bitcoin as a fringe asset is over. Now, it’s knocking on the front doors of traditional finance. As Italy inches closer to crypto-friendly banking, savvy investors are turning their attention to the next wave of altcoins leading this digital evolution. Here are the best cryptos to buy now as Europe’s financial tide turns. Best Crypto to Buy Now - Top 4 List Crypto adoption is accelerating—and the right tokens now could be the power plays of tomorrow. From AI-infused meme coins to creator-first ecosystems, these picks are more than trends—they’re tools for the new economy. MIND of Pepe With a majority of Italians backing Bitcoin’s entry into traditional banking, the narrative around digital assets is clearly shifting. Riding this wave of mainstream interest is MIND of Pepe —a meme coin that blends AI-powered tools with community-driven energy, offering a smarter and more strategic take on viral tokens. In this environment, tokens that blend cultural relevance with utility stand out. Enter MIND of Pepe—a meme-powered, AI-integrated token designed to represent more than just value. It’s a symbol of crypto’s evolution into a cultural movement. MIND of Pepe isn’t just a meme coin; it incorporates elements of AI agents, creative interaction, and community intelligence. As traditional banks move toward crypto adoption, tokens like MIND will play a key role in onboarding new users—not just through tech, but through entertainment, relatability, and humor. For Italy, where meme culture and social media engagement are thriving, MIND of Pepe offers an inviting entry point into crypto. Its unique approach lowers the barrier to entry, making crypto fun, accessible, and emotionally engaging—especially for younger, digitally native generations who may soon manage their crypto directly through bank-linked wallets. MIND of Pepe has become a popular name among several leading content creators too. The 99Bitcoins YouTube channel was one of the many entities that endorsed the project and claimed that it has huge potential for growth. As banks begin embracing digital assets, MIND of Pepe represents the cultural face of this financial shift. It’s not just about investing—it’s about joining a movement that blends technology, community, and personality in a way that traditional finance never could. BTC Bull Italian crypto enthusiasts have made one thing loud and clear—Italians aren’t just curious about crypto; they’re ready to see Bitcoin in banks. That shift in mindset opens the floodgates for BTC-inspired tokens like BTC Bull , which blends grassroots energy with the rising call for institutional acceptance. Amid this growing appetite for Bitcoin access through banks, BTC Bull presents a bold opportunity for investors seeking more than just passive exposure. BTC Bull is a community-driven token designed to amplify gains during Bitcoin bull markets. As Italian investors push for easier crypto access, BTC Bull can position itself as the go-to option for those who believe in Bitcoin’s future and want to capitalize on its uptrends—without relying solely on BTC price action. As banks begin offering Bitcoin accounts, ETFs, and custodial services, a new wave of retail interest is bound to follow. BTC Bull rides this momentum, offering a tokenomics model built around Bitcoin’s price cycles, bullish sentiment, and community engagement. For retail investors who are entering crypto via trusted banking portals, BTC Bull offers a strategic way to participate in Bitcoin’s growth with more upside potential—especially in times of market optimism, like now. In a market where Bitcoin is increasingly seen as the new gold, BTC Bull gives it horns—allowing everyday investors to ride the wave with added power and excitement. SUBBD At the Clear Summit 2025, the message was loud and clear—Europeans want crypto that works for them, not just with them. SUBBD enters the picture not as a buzzword-heavy token, but as a functional tool to eliminate subscription chaos. In an era of financial redefinition, practicality is power—and SUBBD delivers just that. SUBBD is a Web3-powered platform focused on content monetization, built for creators who want to control their income, community, and reach. As banks and traditional finance start embracing crypto, platforms like SUBBD will benefit from a new wave of legitimacy and user adoption. Imagine a creator in Italy receiving subscription payments directly into a crypto wallet, converting earnings to stablecoins, or staking them—all without needing traditional intermediaries. With banks integrating crypto services, creators could even connect their SUBBD wallets directly to bank accounts, bridging the gap between decentralized content platforms and real-world utility. SUBBD thrives in this environment by offering tools for direct creator-fan engagement, automated subscription models, and transparent earnings through blockchain. As Italy moves toward mainstream crypto adoption, SUBBD stands ready to give creators the infrastructure to monetize more freely, globally, and securely. https://t.co/C85UjAUGYp — SUBBD (@SUBBDofficial) April 17, 2025 Crypto banking isn’t just a win for investors. It’s a massive opportunity for the creator class—and SUBBD is building the platform they’ll need to thrive in this new financial era. Solana Italy’s latest pro-Bitcoin stance at the Clear Summit 2025 isn’t just a win for BTC—it’s a signal that Europe is ready to embrace blockchain infrastructure. As scalability becomes a top priority, Solana’s lightning-fast ecosystem emerges as a frontrunner for powering the next generation of financial innovation. Solana uses a unique combination of Proof-of-History (PoH) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms to enable fast, scalable, and decentralized applications (dApps). Solana is not just another blockchain; it's one of the fastest and most scalable networks in the crypto world, capable of handling over 65,000 transactions per second with near-zero fees. For banks exploring crypto integrations, this is a game-changer. As financial institutions look to adopt user-friendly crypto products—like savings accounts in stablecoins, instant cross-border transfers, and digital asset trading—they need technology that’s reliable, cheap, and scalable. Solana checks all three boxes. Unlike older, congested networks, Solana offers institutional-grade throughput with the speed and responsiveness needed to onboard thousands—if not millions—of users. Its growing ecosystem of DeFi protocols, tokenized assets, and stablecoins makes it an ideal launchpad for banks to build upon. With countries like Italy warming up to crypto integration, the demand for high-performance blockchain platforms is only going to grow. Solana’s efficiency and ecosystem depth make it a natural pick for the next wave of institutional and real-world adoption. Conclusion Italy’s crypto awakening isn’t just symbolic—it’s structural. As banks prepare to open their vaults to Bitcoin, the ecosystem around it is already evolving. These aren’t just tokens—they’re signals of what’s next. From creator-driven models to AI-powered communities, each one reflects a future where crypto isn’t the alternative—it’s the infrastructure. If you’re scanning the horizon for the best crypto to buy now, these picks aren’t just timely—they’re foundational. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

This trendline, drawn from the highs around $110,000, marks a shift in sentiment. As Bitcoin now trades above $84,900, the breakout signals the potential for a trend reversal or, at the very least, a relief rally. The breakout candle shows a strong upward close, suggesting that bullish forces are gradually gaining traction. MACD on the Daily: Momentum Shifting Towards Bulls The daily MACD indicator further confirms the bullish outlook, as the MACD line crosses above the signal line. This crossover, the first in several weeks, is often an early signal of upward momentum. While the histogram is just beginning to show positive bars, its increasing slope indicates that buying pressure is building. Holding above the $80,000 support adds further weight to the argument for a short-term rally. 4-Hour Chart: Bullish Continuation Likely After Breakout On the 4-hour chart, BTC has been forming a series of higher lows, signaling accumulation. After initially breaking above the descending trendline, Bitcoin has been consolidating above $84,000, a key support level. The consolidation resembles a bullish flag, which is often followed by a continuation. A break above $85,200 could see Bitcoin push higher toward the next resistance. Building Momentum for Further Upside The 4-hour MACD has been in positive territory for several sessions, with the MACD line holding above the signal line. The green histogram bars are expanding, reinforcing the ongoing bullish momentum. While volume is not yet explosive, the MACD strength across timeframes signals that any dips could quickly be absorbed, continuing the bullish trend. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 1-Hour Chart: Range-Bound Consolidation Above Breakout Level In the 1-hour timeframe, Bitcoin is moving within a narrow range between $84,400 and $85,200. This range consolidation after a breakout is a typical continuation pattern. The market is absorbing liquidity before potentially pushing higher. The formation of an ascending triangle is likely, especially if the price continues to print higher lows. A break above $85,200 could trigger a sharp move upwards . Supporting Intraday Upside Momentum The 1-hour MACD confirms the bullish intraday trend, with the MACD line above the signal line and green histogram bars showing gradual growth. Although the 1-hour timeframe offers less weight than higher timeframes, it still reinforces the bullish view when aligned with the 4-hour and daily charts. If the price holds above $84,000, the upward momentum is likely to persist. Price Prediction For Today With multiple bullish crossovers across timeframes and stable consolidation, Bitcoin is poised for further gains today . If the uptrend continues, $85,800 (TP1) is a logical target, with $87,000 (TP2) and $88,500 (TP3) possible on a breakout. Ideal entry remains within $84,500–$85,300, with stop-losses placed just below $82,800 to manage risk. The bullish trend is well-supported, and traders should aim for profit-taking as the price approaches these targets.

This consolidation has seen the price drop slowly, but steadily, losing around 40% of its value since then. Currently, bulls seem to have created support for the altcoin at $2, as this level continues to hold even through crashes. Thus, it has created the expectation that the bottom could be close for the XRP price, and this could serve as a bounce-off point. XRP Price Consolidation Could Be Over Soon Taking to X (formerly Twitter), crypto analyst Dark Defender revealed that the consolidation that the XRP Price has been stuck in for months now is coming to an end. The analyst used the monthly chart for the analysis, calling out an end and a bottom for the XRP price. According to him, this is actually the “Final Consolidation” for XRP, suggesting that this is where a breakout would start from. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Eyes Next Critical Level At $0.18, Is A Break Above $0.25 Possible? With the consolidation expected to come to an end soon, the crypto analyst highlights what could be next for the altcoin using the 5-Wave analysis. Now, in total, these five waves are still very bullish for the price and could end up marking a new all-time high. For the first wave, Dark Defender calls it the Impulsive Wave 1, which is expected to begin the uptrend. This first wave is expected to push the price back to $3 before the second wave starts, and this second wave is bearish. The second wave would trigger a crash from $3 back toward $2.2, providing the setup for the third wave. Once the third wave begins, this is where the crypto analyst expects the XRP price to hit a new all-time high. The target for Wave 3 puts the XRP price as high as $5, clearing the 2017 all-time high of $3.8. Next in line is the fourth wave, which is another bearish wave. This wave will cause at least a 30% crash, according to the chart shared by the crypto analyst, taking it back toward the $3 territory once again. However, just like the second bearish wave, the fourth bearish wave is expected to set up the price for a final and more explosive Wave 5.

This is Strategy, the company that made a daring move back in 2020 by putting Bitcoin at the center of its financial strategy. Since then, its stock has surged by an eye-popping 2,500%. Bitcoin itself has jumped 614% over the same period, but Strategy’s stock has gone even further. For context, Nvidia — now the world’s most valuable company thanks to the AI boom — has climbed around 808%. Tesla, another company that holds Bitcoin, has risen just 155%. Read on for more! Still Beating the Market in 2024 Recently, Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor highlighted these numbers in a post on X. This year alone, Strategy’s stock is up just over 11%. While that might not seem huge, it’s still ahead of the Nasdaq-100, showing that Strategy isn’t simply benefiting from a strong overall market. The company’s steady accumulation of Bitcoin has even helped stabilize the cryptocurrency somewhat, especially during recent global market uncertainty caused by tariff concerns and fears of a slowdown. Choose your Fighter pic.twitter.com/g4POkRFNfI — Michael Saylor (@saylor) April 18, 2025 Critics Aren’t Convinced Not everyone is sold on the strategy. Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff recently joked that if Bitcoin crashes, the company should rename itself “Micro.” Entrepreneur Jason Calacanis also voiced concern that Strategy’s large Bitcoin position could affect the decentralized nature of the crypto market. Still, Michael Saylor isn’t backing down. Strategy continues to open up new funding options to increase its Bitcoin holdings. For investors willing to take bigger risks, there are even ETFs available that offer double exposure to MSTR stock. At the moment, Bitcoin is holding near $84,000 after a short recovery. The bounce came shortly after Trump announced a 90-day pause on enforcing new tariffs, giving global markets a temporary sigh of relief. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Price Prediction: How Low Can BTC Go in a Recession? , A New Chapter in Finance With MSTR stock leaving both Bitcoin and Nvidia behind in terms of growth, Strategy’s Bitcoin-first approach is starting to redefine how companies think about finance.

Gensler’s comments come amid increasing scrutiny of the SEC’s shifting regulatory strategy, as it backs away from key legal battles against firms including Ripple, Coinbase, and Kraken. CNBC host Andrew Ross Sorkin asked the former SEC chair about the wave of optimism within the digital asset industry following the dropped cases. Sorkin remarked, “As you probably watched, so many CEOs were doing almost victory laps in the crypto world as these enforcement cases were dropped by this current administration…what did you think?” Gensler Warns of Sentiment-Driven Valuations Gensler refrained from discussing specific cases but pointed out his broader concerns about the cryptocurrency sector, particularly the role of sentiment in driving value. He stated, “Almost 99% [of the crypto field] is based on sentiment.” His broader criticism focused on the sustainability of the industry. Gensler said, “If this is just about sentiment, then, generally, those don’t end up well, and most then go down.” He also noted that digital assets such as Bitcoin may continue to hold investor interest, observing, “Something like Bitcoin” could endure due to a “real keen interest” from the public. SEC Retreats from Legal Battles Against Major Firms The SEC, under its current leadership, has decided to formally withdraw its appeal in the long-running legal case against Ripple Labs . Additionally, the agency has dismissed or ended enforcement actions involving several other major industry participants, including Coinbase and Kraken. The shift marks a significant departure from the agency’s previous aggressive enforcement stance under Gensler’s tenure. Skepticism About Long-Term Viability of Tokens When discussing the broader outlook of the industry, Gensler drew a comparison between cryptocurrencies and commodities. He noted that precious metals have retained value over time, while expressing doubt that digital tokens would follow a similar trajectory. “There’s only 2 or 3 precious metals. We humans have a certain fascination with 2 or 3 precious metals like gold. I don’t think we humans will have a fascination with 10 or 15,000 meme or sentiment tokens trading over the years,” he said. Although Gensler was responsible for the approval of the first U.S.-based spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) , a move that contributed to institutional adoption, his leadership at the SEC has been widely criticized within the crypto community. He is often associated with the agency’s “regulation by enforcement” strategy, which resulted in a wave of lawsuits targeting various blockchain companies and platforms. The recent rollback of several enforcement actions has fueled speculation about a potential policy shift under the current SEC administration. While the agency has not provided detailed explanations for the change in approach, it has significantly altered the regulatory landscape, offering temporary relief for many in the digital asset sector.

43522717,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=712338,1745053086,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/43522717.jpeg,Brazilian court jails three men for $190 million crypto Ponzi scheme,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/brazilian-court-jails-three-men-crypto-ponzi/,"A Brazilian court has jailed three men for their involvement in a cryptocurrency Ponzi scheme where they stole about $190 million. According to reports, the Brazilian court slammed a combined jail term of 170 years on the three men, underscoring the severity of the case. The men were accused of being the brains behind the Braiscompany scandal, using the platform to scam unsuspecting users. According to the prosecutors, the three men, Joel Ferreira de Souza, Gesana Rayane da Silva, and Victor Augusto Veronez de Souza, defrauded at least 20,000 investors. The scandal has become a big case where most people have been awaiting the outcome, primarily because it involves funds estimated to be around $190 million. Brazilian courts jail suspects over crypto Ponzi scheme According to prosecutors, the defendants promised unsuspecting victims unrealistic returns on Bitcoin investments, luring Brazilians into the deceptive pyramid scheme that has gained attention globally. A pyramid or Ponzi scheme is a type of investment where the operators usually float mouth-watering opportunities to users. This way, they recruit a lot of Brazilians looking for profits while paying the earlier ones with funds obtained from new investors. In some cases, the platform recruits users who act as advertisers, using several social media platforms to float the opportunities to people, with most of them going as far as developing intimate friendships and relationships with their potential victims before introducing them to the investment opportunities. In this case, the prosecutor mentioned that Ferreira de Souza was the principal of the Braiscompany scheme, noting that the platform operated under the guise of legitimacy to push the opportunity to the general public. The prosecutors allege that many people invested funds, with most in digital assets, believing that they were partaking in a life-changing venture. They mentioned that the platform targeted victims who were new to cryptocurrency, noting that the financial fallout from the scheme has been devastating for those who participated. In addition to the jail sentence, the court has ordered the defendants to repay about $6.2 million to investors, as the police continue efforts to recoup some of the stolen funds. Need for vigilance in the crypto sector This is not the first time the Brazilian investment platform is in the news, with the company making the news in 2021 after it filed a lawsuit against Suno Research, accusing the company of slander, libel, and defamation for attacking its brand. At the time, the research platform had accused the investment platform of being a financial pyramid scheme, a move that Braiscompany was against, noting that Suno Research made its claim without any shred of evidence. According to reports, the founder of Suno Research Tiago Reis claimed in a series of posts that the promise of making 10% to 15% per month from renting Bitcoin was the workings of a pyramid scheme. The Brazilian investment company, at the time, managed to get the court to mandate Suno to remove links to the articles and publications where they made the claims. Braiscompany was also turned around in court because Suno made an application in court, where it urged the judge to mandate the investment platform prove that it was not a pyramid scheme. “These brokerage notes are justified to demonstrate the percentages and amounts of transactions made with the clients’ capital and whether there is proof of payment for these, in the event of withdrawal, which can be certified under the terms of the expert evidence requested,” Suno claimed. Although Braiscompany tried to overturn the decision at the time, it was unsuccessful, with its lawyers noting that the case was about image violation and not whether the company was involved in illegal activities. The case also speaks to the need for vigilance in the crypto sector. The legal verdict also reflects the need to come up with stricter measures to protect investors. Local banks and financial institutions in Brazil are now offering crypto investments to users, drumming the importance of the need to safeguard consumer interest amidst the positive growth of the crypto market.

While each project has a different strength, they remain part of nearly every analyst’s top portfolio picks moving into mid-2025. ETH continues to dominate in development environments and smart contract infrastructure. XRP is back in the spotlight after regulatory tailwinds pushed its utility case into clearer focus. BTC , as always, holds the status of digital gold and institutional hedge, especially during macro shakeups. LIMITED SPOTS — JOIN 2025’S BIGGEST PRESALE! 1. MAGACOINFINANCE – The Standout Early-Stage Entry Unlike anything else on this list, MAGACOINFINANCE is still at the early entry phase—and that’s where the advantage lies. With momentum accelerating across crypto forums, Telegram groups, and social platforms, this project is picking up real attention before the broader market catches on. The current buying window won’t stay open forever. Every day that passes, more wallets join and supply tightens. Analysts say it’s one of the rare chances left to get into a fast-moving altcoin before listing takes over the narrative. The upside? A confirmed listing target combined with a 50% bonus through the MAGA50X promo is enough to make early participants rethink their crypto allocation. 2. Ethereum (ETH) – Still the Smart Contract King Despite newer platforms entering the race, ETH still holds dominance over smart contract infrastructure. It remains a core part of any serious portfolio, with ongoing scaling updates and robust development activity. MAGACOINFINANCE UNDER $0.0004 — 100x COMING! 3. Bitcoin (BTC) – Macro Momentum and Long-Term Trust As always, BTC leads when it comes to macro conviction. Institutional interest remains strong, and its scarcity model continues to drive long-term demand—even in periods of price consolidation. 4. XRP – Utility-Driven and Legally Reinforced Now past much of its legal ambiguity, XRP is once again gaining traction for its role in global transfers and cross-border finance. It has a large community and continues to be one of the most discussed tokens on social platforms. 5. Cardano (ADA) – Underrated Development and Growing Use Often overlooked, ADA continues to build its foundation with research-first methodology and growing smart contract support. It’s a slow builder—but one that shouldn’t be ignored. 50% EXTRA BONUS LIVE — USE CO-DE MAGA50X BEFORE IT’S GONE! Conclusion From established powerhouses to the breakout potential of MAGACOINFINANCE , these five projects are shaping the crypto watchlist for 2025. With urgency rising around early-stage opportunities, now may be the best time to look twice before the next wave arrives.

The company says that XRP is in a critical testing phase after breaking out of a months-long downtrend. Whether this situation is a harbinger of a sustainable rise or just a bull trap will become clear in the coming days. According to the analytics company, XRP has managed to break above the long-standing red downtrend line. Similar breakouts have been followed by rapid pullbacks in the past, but this time the pullback is softer and is progressing in a corrective structure. The price is currently trading at around $2.03, which is the area where the broken trend line is being retested. This level is critical for direction. According to MakroVision, the critical resistance and support levels are as follows: $2.20 to $2.23: First strong resistance band ahead. $2.29 level: It stands out as the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level. In the bullish scenario, the next targets are $2.48 and then $2.65. Above this level, there could be room to open up to the “golden pocket” region. Related News: BREAKING: Spot ETF Application Filed for Surprise Altcoin $2.03 level: The broken trend line needs to act as a retest zone. $1.96: Last structural support. A drop below this level could jeopardize the positive technical outlook. Analysts made the following final comments: “XRP is showing strength again. However, this time its durability is being tested. If it can hold above $2.03, it could be a strong bullish sign. Otherwise, a drop below this level could put selling pressure on investors.” *This is not investment advice.

In a new interview with Kyle Chasse on his YouTube channel, Cowen says that Bitcoin may surge to as high as $200,000 if the flagship crypto asset is currently in a right-translated cycle – or a market cycle where prices tend to peak later rather than earlier. “I would say that it’s possible if we get a right translated cycle that from the bottom Bitcoin could go up about 10x or something, which would probably put it around $150,000. So I would say, in a right translated cycle my guess is that it would be anywhere from like $120,000 to like $150,000. It’s possible in the perfect scenario that it could go all the way up to $200,000. I don’t think Bitcoin will hit $300,000 this cycle. I do think Bitcoin will eventually hit $300,000, but I don’t think it will be this cycle.” He says that Bitcoin needs to hold the 2024 high of about $72,000 on the weekly chart to remain on track to hit fresh all-time highs this cycle. “Anything is possible. And I would certainly be more optimistic if we can definitively hold that 2024 high [around $72,000 on the weekly chart] and start to move back up. I would definitely become more optimistic later on this year. That’s my main concern right now, is, if there is another pullback, can we hold it? The good news is we’ve held it so far, and we actually technically we haven’t even tested it. So the good news is if there is another drop, you probably would have some bulls try to hold the line at those levels because we haven’t even tested those levels yet.” Bitcoin is trading for $84,483 at time of writing, flat on the day.

In a video posted to X on April 18 , Pompliano cautioned against politicizing the U.S. central bank. “I do not believe that the President of the United States should come in and unilaterally fire the Fed President,” he said. “The idea of firing the Fed chairman is a very bad precedent to set this way.” Pompliano Responds to Trump’s Criticism of Fed Chair Over Rate Cuts Pompliano’s comments followed a post from Trump on his platform Truth Social on April 17, where the former president criticized Powell for not cutting interest rates quickly enough. “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” Trump wrote, sparking renewed concern over political interference in monetary policy. While acknowledging that the Fed is already viewed by many as politicized, Pompliano insisted that retaliating through executive overreach isn’t the solution. “Even if someone is doing something wrong, it doesn’t justify doing something wrong in return,” he said. Despite being a vocal critic of the Fed himself, Pompliano emphasized the importance of preserving the institution’s operational independence. Lower interest rates are generally viewed as beneficial for risk-on assets like Bitcoin, which often surge in more accommodative monetary environments. However, Pompliano stressed that market benefits should not come at the cost of institutional integrity. Why is the price of bitcoin flat? Should Trump fire Jerome Powell? Will The US lose reserve currency status? I answer your questions pic.twitter.com/S7Q6hANR3H — Anthony Pompliano (@APompliano) April 18, 2025 The crypto entrepreneur is not alone in voicing concern. Senator Elizabeth Warren also warned that removing Powell would damage investor confidence and could spark broader market instability. Speaking to CNBC, Warren said, “If Chairman Powell can be fired by the President of the United States, it will crash the markets.” She added that U.S. economic strength depends on the perception of independence among key institutions like the Fed. “If interest rates in the United States are subject to a president who just wants to wave his magic wand, this doesn’t distinguish us from any other two-bit dictatorship,” Warren said. Trump Renews Pressure on Fed Chair Powell Trump has consistently pressured Powell over rate policy since his time in office and has recently renewed calls for his removal. Florida Senator Rick Scott echoed these sentiments, writing in a Fox News op-ed that the Fed needs a leadership overhaul focused on “fighting for the American people.” The Fed last cut interest rates back in December 2024, with Powell repeatedly saying that he wants compelling evidence of cooling inflation before doing so again. By comparison, the European Central Bank has already slashed its main rate three times so far in 2025, which is the source of Trump’s frustration. Despite all of this uncertainty, there are those who argue that a diminished dollar could be advantageous for Bitcoin in the medium to long-term. Real Vision founder Raoul Pal has long believed that a weaker greenback encourages investors to try and preserve wealth through alternatives like BTC.

The company has recorded a 2,466% stock increase since August 2020 and has outperformed leading technology companies like Nvidia, Tesla, Google and Microsoft. Strategy made a bold pivot towards Bitcoin before the adoption and integration of digital currencies became mainstream. The company made its decision at a time when established tech companies were channeling their efforts into artificial intelligence and cloud computing. Strategy is now reaping the benefits of what many considered a risky investment when it bet on Bitcoin as its primary reserve asset. Comparison of the MSTR ticker with big tech stocks. Source: Bitcoin Magazine (X/Twitter) Strategy’s Bitcoin playbook has delivered since 2020 In August 2020, MicroStrategy, under Saylor’s leadership, began investing a significant portion of its cash reserves into Bitcoin. The firm pivoted to Bitcoin due to concerns about inflation and the diminishing purchasing power of fiat currencies. By adopting Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset, Strategy intended to preserve and enhance its shareholder value. The company’s accumulation playbook involved purchasing Bitcoin through excess cash flows, as well as debt and equity offerings. As of December 2024, the firm held approximately 447,470 BTC, which represented over 2% of the total Bitcoin supply. Now it’s April 2025, and Strategy has garnered an impressive 531,644 BTC, which represents approximately 2.5% of Bitcoin’s total capped supply of 21M coins. The coins were acquired at an average price of approximately $66K per Bitcoin, which totals about $33B in investment. From late 2024 to date, the company has increased its Bitcoin holdings by over 84,000 BTC. This rapid accumulation is due to a “21/21” capital plan which aims to raise $42B. Of the $42B, $21B will be raised through equity and the other $21B via debt. The capital plan is aimed at expanding Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings. ​ In January 2025, the company acquired 11,000 BTC for approximately $1.1B, financed through stock sales. This purchase brought its total holdings to 461,000 BTC. Strategy then raised approximately $711M by selling a new series of preferred stock in March 2025. The company intends to invest the proceeds into additional Bitcoin purchases. Outperforming tech giants Thanks to its aggressive Bitcoin accumulation, Strategy has outperformed major technology companies including Nvidia, Tesla, Google, Apple, and Microsoft. Since the start of Strategy’s Bitcoin-focused initiative, the company’s stock has surged by an impressive 2,466%. As it stands, the firm now holds the largest Bitcoin reserves among publicly traded companies, apart from Bitcoin ETF managers. The MSTR ticker has a sizable lead on tech giants like Nvidia , Google, Microsoft, Apple, and others in the stock market, surpassing Nvidia by over a thousand percentage points. According to a post by Bitcoin Magazine on X, Nvidia’s stocks were reported at 808% while Tesla’s sat at 155%. Google, Meta and Microsoft were positioned further down the poll at 105%, 91%, and 77% respectively. Even in 2024, MSTR had already surpassed these companies with a 477% increase in its stock value. The firm’s biggest advantage comes from Bitcoin consistently delivering strong returns with an average return of 37%, outperforming gold and the S&P 500 since 2020.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues its rapid rise during its presale phase by collecting $6.9 million with 412 million tokens distributed to 8,400 unique holders. During Phase 4 investors can purchase tokens at $0.025 each while Phase 5 sets a 20% higher price rate to $0.03. The cryptocurrency market views these two projects differently even though they operate in different directions. The battle between Cardano ADA and Mutuum Finance MUTM depends on which platform can achieve better DeFi capabilities. Let’s break it down. Cardano’s Uphill Battle The Cardano (ADA) cryptocurrency demonstrates determination by rising 1.1% during the recent 24-hour period to achieve its tenth position among biggest cryptocurrencies which currently have a market capitalization of $23 billion. Technical analysis shows that the double-bottom pattern suggests an upcoming climb to $0.75 level which will increase the token value by 16.5% while positive readings from RSI and MACD indicator support this upward momentum. Yet, storm clouds linger. The recent decline in trading activity reached 7.59% as measured by $661.97 million while a divergence with bearish RSI indicates decreasing market strength. A fall below $0.630 could start a descent to $0.580 if Cardano (ADA) loses support in the market. This token has remained stationary between $0.55 and $0.60 throughout several years in what has proven to be an impossible challenge to reach $1. A major market rally in 2025 becomes doubtful because of current inertial conditions although investors maintain cautious optimism. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Surge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues through Phase 4 of its 11-part presale period while offering its tokens at a current price of $0.025. The project currently attracts investors who have bought 412 million tokens as it gathers $6.9 million during its Phase 4 presale. The current phase sell-out trend will continue through Phase 5 where prices will rise to $0.03 thus delivering a 20% profit to existing buyers. A 9,900% return on investment predicted for MUTM tokens presents itself after the initial listing price of $0.06 while the tokenomics already guarantee investors a 140% profit. The project launched a dashboard that featured the top 50 token holders so they could earn bonus tokens by maintaining their position. The price reduction creates loyalty and urgency because buyers will lose their current positions when the reduced slots sell out. Security and Stability in Focus The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team enhances security standards by completing a smart contract audit process through Certik. The outcome will demonstrate on social media to prove the trustworthiness of the DeFi lending model. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides instant utility through its dynamic interest rates system and overcollateralized loan option during a period when Cardano continues to develop its DeFi offerings at a slower pace.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has established a focused expansion strategy that positions it as a top choice in the market compared to Cardano (ADA) which faces obstacles with declining volume levels and resistance barriers. Current market dynamics push Cardano (ADA) between promising growth potentials and potential downward trends while its price target remains at $0.75. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) leads a pre-sale charge which combines guaranteed investment yields alongside an ambitious $2.50 price expectation after launch. The Phase 4 entry at $0.025 provides only a temporary entry opportunity since 8,400 users have already joined. Don’t miss out—visit MUTM site to join the presale before Phase 5’s price hike.

The ever-vocal Bitcoin critic, economist Peter Schiff, is back in the ring, and this time he’s swinging hard at the very core of Bitcoin’s popular narrative: its identity as ‘digital gold’. According to a recent CryptoPotato report, Schiff has doubled down on his skepticism, branding the ‘digital gold’ marketing of Bitcoin as nothing short of a ‘fraud’. But is there any merit to his claims, or is this just another round of FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) from a known Bitcoin bear? Let’s dive deep into Schiff’s arguments and unpack what this means for the future of Bitcoin and your crypto portfolio. Is Bitcoin Really ‘Digital Gold’ or Just a High-Risk Asset? Schiff’s central argument, voiced on a recent X podcast, is that while Bitcoin is touted as the digital equivalent of gold, its trading behavior tells a completely different story. He asserts that true precious metals, like gold, act as safe havens, especially during economic turmoil. However, Bitcoin, in his view, behaves more like a highly speculative tech stock – volatile, unpredictable, and far from a store of value. Here’s a breakdown of Schiff’s key points: ‘Digital Gold’ Narrative is Misleading: Schiff believes that marketing Bitcoin as ‘digital gold’ is a deceptive tactic. He argues that gold has intrinsic value and a long history as a safe haven asset, while Bitcoin is purely speculative. Lacks Use Case Compared to Tech Stocks: He contrasts Bitcoin with tech stocks, which, despite their risks, represent ownership in companies with potential future earnings and real-world business growth. Schiff questions Bitcoin’s fundamental utility and real-world application beyond speculation. Extreme Volatility: Schiff points out Bitcoin’s extreme price swings, arguing that true safe-haven assets should exhibit more stability, especially during economic downturns. He sees Bitcoin’s volatility as a hallmark of a high-risk asset, not a store of value. No Solid Backing: Unlike traditional assets or even tech stocks backed by company performance, Schiff argues that Bitcoin lacks tangible backing, making its value purely dependent on market sentiment and speculation. To illustrate his point, Schiff highlights the recent market trends. While gold often sees increased demand during periods of economic uncertainty, Bitcoin tends to fluctuate wildly, often mirroring the movements of risky assets like tech stocks. This, according to Schiff, directly contradicts the ‘digital gold’ thesis. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Bet: A Ticking Time Bomb? Schiff didn’t stop at just criticizing Bitcoin’s core narrative. He also cast a dark shadow over MicroStrategy, now known as Strategy, the publicly traded company infamous for its massive Bitcoin holdings. With a staggering 531,644 BTC in its treasury, MicroStrategy is arguably the most prominent corporate believer in Bitcoin. However, Schiff predicts a grim future for the company, forecasting eventual bankruptcy due to its aggressive Bitcoin strategy. Why such a dire prediction? Overexposure to a Volatile Asset: Schiff views MicroStrategy’s massive Bitcoin investment as reckless overexposure to an extremely volatile asset. He believes that any significant downturn in the Bitcoin market could severely impact the company’s balance sheet. Leveraged Bet: MicroStrategy has often used debt financing to acquire more Bitcoin, amplifying both potential gains and potential losses. Schiff sees this leveraged bet as incredibly risky, especially if Bitcoin’s price declines sharply. Business Model Reliance on Bitcoin: MicroStrategy’s stock price is now heavily correlated with Bitcoin’s price. Schiff argues that this dependence makes the company vulnerable and its stock a proxy for a highly speculative cryptocurrency rather than a stable business investment. While MicroStrategy’s CEO, Michael Saylor, remains a staunch Bitcoin advocate, Schiff’s warning raises serious questions about the risks associated with such concentrated exposure to a volatile asset, especially for publicly traded companies and their shareholders. Decoding ‘Digital Gold’: What Does It Actually Mean? The term ‘ digital gold ‘ has become synonymous with Bitcoin within the cryptocurrency community. But what does it really mean, and why is this narrative so powerful? Proponents of the ‘digital gold’ narrative argue that Bitcoin shares several key characteristics with gold: Scarcity: Just like gold is a finite resource, Bitcoin has a capped supply of 21 million coins, making it inherently scarce. This scarcity is often touted as a key driver of long-term value. Decentralization: Both gold and Bitcoin are seen as decentralized assets, outside the direct control of governments and central banks. This decentralization appeals to those seeking alternatives to traditional financial systems. Store of Value Potential: Historically, gold has been used as a store of value, preserving wealth over long periods. Bitcoin proponents believe it can serve a similar purpose in the digital age, acting as a hedge against inflation and economic instability. Portability and Divisibility (Digital Advantage): Unlike physical gold, Bitcoin is easily portable across borders and highly divisible, making it practical for digital transactions and storage in the modern world. However, Schiff and other critics argue that these similarities are superficial and that Bitcoin lacks the established history, stability, and real-world utility of gold to truly earn the ‘digital gold’ title. They emphasize the speculative nature of Bitcoin’s price movements and its vulnerability to market sentiment and technological disruptions. Investment Risk: Navigating the Volatility of Bitcoin Peter Schiff’s critique ultimately boils down to the concept of investment risk . He firmly believes that Bitcoin is a high-risk asset, unsuitable for those seeking a safe haven or a reliable store of value. Understanding and managing investment risk is crucial for anyone venturing into the cryptocurrency market, particularly with Bitcoin. Here are key considerations regarding investment risk in Bitcoin: Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price is notoriously volatile, experiencing dramatic swings in short periods. This volatility can lead to significant gains but also substantial losses. Market Sentiment Dependence: Bitcoin’s price is heavily influenced by market sentiment, news cycles, and social media trends. This makes it susceptible to rapid shifts in investor confidence. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Changes in regulations can significantly impact Bitcoin’s price and adoption. Technological Risks: While the Bitcoin network is generally secure, technological risks like smart contract vulnerabilities in related platforms or potential quantum computing threats remain concerns. Lack of Intrinsic Value (Argument): Critics like Schiff argue that Bitcoin lacks intrinsic value, making its price purely speculative and dependent on continued demand. For investors considering Bitcoin, it’s essential to acknowledge these risks and approach it as a potentially high-reward, but also high-risk asset class. Diversification, risk management strategies, and thorough research are crucial for navigating the volatile world of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Actionable Insights: Making Informed Decisions About Bitcoin So, what are the actionable takeaways from Peter Schiff’s critique and the ongoing debate about Bitcoin’s identity? Whether you agree with Schiff or remain a Bitcoin believer, here are some insights to guide your crypto journey: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Don’t blindly follow narratives, whether it’s ‘digital gold’ or ‘fraud’. Conduct thorough research, understand the technology, the market dynamics, and the risks involved before investing in Bitcoin or any cryptocurrency. Risk Assessment is Key: Honestly assess your risk tolerance. Bitcoin is not for the faint of heart. If you are risk-averse, consider allocating only a small portion of your portfolio to cryptocurrencies, or perhaps avoid them altogether. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, especially a volatile one like Bitcoin. Diversify your investments across different asset classes to mitigate risk. Understand Volatility: Be prepared for significant price swings. Don’t invest money you can’t afford to lose. Understand that Bitcoin investments can be highly speculative. Stay Informed: The cryptocurrency space is rapidly evolving. Stay updated on market trends, regulatory developments, and technological advancements to make informed decisions. Conclusion: Navigating the Bitcoin Narrative Peter Schiff’s persistent criticism of Bitcoin, particularly his ‘digital gold fraud’ claim, serves as a crucial reminder to approach the cryptocurrency market with a healthy dose of skepticism and critical thinking. While the ‘digital gold’ narrative has undoubtedly contributed to Bitcoin’s popularity, it’s essential to understand the nuances, risks, and differing perspectives. Whether Bitcoin ultimately proves to be ‘digital gold’ or simply a high-risk asset remains to be seen. However, informed investors who understand the complexities and volatility of Bitcoin are better positioned to navigate this exciting yet unpredictable asset class. The debate continues, and only time will truly tell the final chapter in Bitcoin’s story.

Blockchain is how we save it | Opinion,https://crypto.news/ai-flattens-creativity-blockchain-is-how-we-save-it/,"Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news’ editorial. Our timelines were just filled with a bunch of pastel Miyazaki’s ghosts. Studio Ghibli-style AI generations have become the internet’s new favorite aesthetic. PFPs and marketing campaigns were reborn overnight in the watercolor warmth of Spirited Away. Selfies rendered as soot sprites. You might also like: Ethical AI content is better for creators and fans | Opinion The results are charming yet deeply unsettling. Why? Because Hayao Miyazaki didn’t draw them––and no one asked permission. This isn’t just a copyright problem. It’s an authenticity problem where there is a growing inability to see, trace, or understand the origins of the content that shapes our culture. In the chaos of AI-generated images and memecoins, we’re watching creativity get flattened, authorship obscured, and ownership erased. If that feels like a plague, it’s because it is. The unfettered mess unleashed by generative AI has caused a powerful use case for blockchain to emerge: proof of provenance and onchain verifiability for agentic creation. By anchoring content to public, immutable ledgers, blockchain enables creators to prove authorship, timestamp originality, license works programmatically, and track derivatives across the network—without relying on centralized gatekeepers. With the tools of blockchain, creators can participate in fairer, more transparent ecosystems that reward origin and empower open-source and composable content systems. The collapse of creative clarity Studio Ghibli has not been the only target. In late 2024, Philip Banks created Chill Guy, a laid-back dog meme that exploded into a half-billion-dollar meme token on Solana. But Banks never gave permission. His accounts were hacked. A false licensing deal was forged. When the truth surfaced, the token crashed 45% in 30 minutes. Now imagine that story playing out across every medium, on a global scale. That’s exactly what’s happening with OpenAI’s recent co-option of Studio Ghibli’s IP. Now, AI’s tools can mimic any voice, style, or aesthetic—trained on unlicensed data scraped from the internet and any medium it can consume. Amazon is replacing voice actors with AI. Manga localization is being outsourced to machines. Lawsuits from The New York Times, Getty, and independent artists are piling up. A major problem is that enforcement can’t keep pace with reproduction. The systems we rely on to manage content—from cloud drives to social platforms—cannot tell you where something came from. They fail at proving provenance and, in turn, fail the creators whose livelihoods depend on IP rights. We’re building the next generation of digital culture on a foundation of guesses, not guarantees. Creative authenticity requires new blockchain infrastructure We don’t need more IP lawsuits. We need new rails. Authenticity, or even lucidity—the ability to see clearly and act truthfully—is not just a philosophical idea. In a generative world, it’s a technical requirement. If we want to preserve creative integrity in the age of AI, we need infrastructure that makes origin, attribution, and authorship cryptographically native to every digital asset. Using content-addressable storage and Merkle tree structures, creators can hash their work and register it to a public chain. This hash becomes a permanent fingerprint of the original content. Smart contracts can define licensing conditions, automate royalties, and even govern remix rights. Each derivative, usage event, or ownership change is logged immutably—creating a verifiable timeline of creation, modification, and transaction. This doesn’t just protect artists. It improves the machines, too. With blockchain, creators can cryptographically register their work at the moment of creation. Every change, license, or remix becomes part of a transparent, tamper-proof timeline. Smart contracts can automate royalties. Attribution becomes verifiable. And usage becomes traceable—whether that’s a social post, a dataset, or an AI-generated derivative. This isn’t just hype. It’s a structural shift from guesswork to guarantees, from hearsay to hashes. Without it, artists will keep getting erased. Investors will keep getting rugged. And trust in the creative economy will continue to corrode. Building a truthful internet Freedom of communication and property rights are foundational principles in the canon of Western philosophy. We know that open communication channels and the rule of law to protect private property are the frameworks for building a free society. However, today, our creative systems are plagued with black-box models, closed-source platforms, and training systems on data without audit trails. We have mistaken this flood of content for an abundance of creativity when, in fact, it’s a hollow kind of plenty—one that undermines the creative people it imitates. If we want a future where new Miyazakis, Picassos, and myriad creators are possible––where artists can take risks without getting scraped into the next proprietary model––we must build systems that protect them by design. Blockchain is how we embed authorship into content, how we stop laundering aesthetics, and how we let creativity thrive without erasure. This is not just about bad actors. It’s bad architecture. And the cure isn’t outrage—it’s about provenance. Authenticity isn’t a luxury anymore. It’s a blockchain.

The cryptocurrency trended upwards between April 13 and April 19, 2025, with significant price leaps on April 17 and 18. As per latest figures, BNB registered a moderate 1.0% gain in the previous 24 hours.

According to on-chain statistics provider CryptoQuant, BNB, along with Bitcoin, has witnessed little declines compared to other altcoins that dropped as much as 90% from their highs. BNB: The Most Resilient Altcoin in the Crypto Market “While most altcoins have suffered drops of up to -98.5% from their all-time highs, BNB stands out alongside Bitcoin (BTC) as one of the least affected cryptocurrencies” – By @joao_wedson Link ⤵️https://t.co/QLQwJOkfF7 pic.twitter.com/T7Wa6sK6jQ — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) April 17, 2025 The cryptocurrency managed to hit a new all-time high in the recent market cycle, a feat few other digital currencies have achieved. CryptoQuant’s charts reveal BNB appearing in pale red on their charts, which is a much lesser decline compared to other cryptocurrencies that appear in darker shades of red. Common coins such as Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), and Polygon (MATIC) have experienced dramatic highs and lows with long stretches of lowering value before a rebound. Lesser-known cryptocurrencies such as COMP, DASH, and CAKE were hit the hardest when the market changed. Strong Ecosystem Supports BNB Value The good performance of BNB is not all about price action. CryptoQuant explains that BNB’s stability is due to its real-world applications within the Binance ecosystem. The coin has various roles on the Binance platform, such as being used to pay for transaction fees, trading fees, and running applications on the Binance Smart Chain. A lot of traders like to swap their altcoins for BNB, which keeps people wanting it. BNB has stayed useful over time, helping more people use it and making it one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies today. Market analyst Master of Crypto noted how real-life utilities of BNB put it several steps ahead of other cryptocurrencies without real-world applications. The utility of the coin to sustain the whole ecosystem of Binance will continue to reinforce its market value. Related Reading: Is Shiba Inu On Track To Dethrone Dogecoin?

This RSI reading just tells us that the market is in consolidation and that neither buyers nor sellers are gaining an edge. If the RSI crosses above 50, it would tell us that momentum is steadily building in the direction of the bulls. Conversely, if it drops below 45, what it could indicate is a deterioration of price strength.

Recent discussions around potentially firing Fed Chair Jerome Powell have sparked serious debate, especially within the cryptocurrency and financial communities. Anthony Pompliano, a prominent figure in crypto investment through Pomp Investments, has voiced a strong warning : removing Powell would set a dangerous precedent with far-reaching consequences. Let’s dive into why this is such a critical issue and what it could mean for the future of the economy. Why is Firing the Fed Chair Considered a Dangerous Move? The core argument against dismissing a Fed chair like Jerome Powell boils down to the principle of central bank independence . Imagine the central bank as a referee in a game. To ensure fair play and maintain stability, the referee needs to be impartial and free from interference from the teams (in this case, political parties). Pomp Investments founder, Anthony Pompliano, highlighted this very concern in a recent video on X, emphasizing that while the Fed isn’t entirely independent, reacting to political pressure with more political action is a recipe for disaster. Here’s a breakdown of the potential pitfalls: Politicization of Monetary Policy: Firing a Fed chair due to disagreements over policy would send a chilling message. It would suggest that monetary policy decisions are subject to political whims rather than economic necessities. This could lead to a lack of trust in the Fed’s actions and its ability to manage inflation and maintain economic stability. Erosion of Investor Confidence: Financial markets thrive on predictability and stability. The abrupt removal of a Fed chair could create significant uncertainty and shake investor confidence. As Senator Elizabeth Warren pointed out, such a move could be a catalyst for a financial crisis . Investors might become wary of the U.S. economy if they perceive that key financial institutions are vulnerable to political manipulation. Precedent for Future Interference: If President Trump were to fire Jerome Powell , it would establish a precedent that future presidents could follow. This could lead to a cycle of political interference in the Fed’s operations, undermining its credibility and effectiveness over time. Anthony Pompliano’s Stance: More Interference is Not the Answer Anthony Pompliano, leading Pomp Investments, isn’t naive about the current state of affairs. He acknowledges the existing criticisms about the Fed’s independence, recognizing that it’s not operating in a vacuum. However, his argument is crucial: responding to perceived political interference with even more direct political action – like firing the Fed chair – is counterproductive. It’s like fighting fire with gasoline. Pompliano’s perspective brings a nuanced understanding to the debate. He’s not necessarily defending the status quo but rather advocating for a more measured and less disruptive approach. His warning resonates with those who believe in the importance of institutional stability, especially in the realm of finance. Senator Warren’s Alarm: A Financial Crisis Risk? Echoing Pompliano’s concerns, Senator Elizabeth Warren has also voiced strong opposition to the idea of firing Jerome Powell . Her warning is stark: such an action could “undermine investor confidence and trigger a financial crisis .” This isn’t just political rhetoric; it’s a reflection of the deep-seated understanding of how markets react to uncertainty and perceived instability. Warren’s statement underscores the gravity of the situation. The fear of a financial crisis is not unfounded. Historically, instances of political meddling with central banks have often been followed by economic turmoil. Maintaining the perceived and actual independence of institutions like the Federal Reserve is paramount for economic stability. The Crucial Role of Central Bank Independence for Financial Stability Why is central bank independence so vital for financial stability ? It boils down to several key factors: Benefit of Central Bank Independence Explanation Credibility and Trust An independent central bank is more likely to be seen as credible and trustworthy by markets and the public. This trust is essential for the effectiveness of monetary policy. Long-Term Focus Independent central banks can focus on long-term economic goals, such as price stability, without being swayed by short-term political pressures or electoral cycles. Expertise-Driven Decisions Decisions made by an independent central bank are typically based on economic expertise and data analysis, rather than political considerations. Reduced Inflation Bias Research suggests that independent central banks are more successful in controlling inflation over the long run. When political interference threatens this independence, all these benefits are put at risk. The markets become jittery, long-term planning becomes difficult, and the focus can shift from sound economic policy to short-sighted political gains. Navigating the Path Forward: Actionable Insights So, what can we take away from this discussion? Here are some actionable insights: Understand the Stakes: Recognize that the debate around firing the Fed chair is not just about personalities; it’s about the fundamental principles of central bank independence and financial stability . Stay Informed: Keep abreast of developments in monetary policy and the discussions surrounding the Fed. Reputable financial news sources and analyses from institutions like Pomp Investments can provide valuable insights. Engage in Constructive Dialogue: Promote discussions that emphasize the importance of institutional independence and the potential risks of political interference . Support Institutional Integrity: Value and advocate for institutions that are designed to operate independently and in the long-term best interests of the economy. Conclusion: Protecting Central Bank Independence is Paramount The warnings from Anthony Pompliano and Senator Elizabeth Warren are clear and compelling. Firing Fed chair Jerome Powell would be more than just a personnel change; it would be a seismic event with potentially devastating consequences for financial stability . It would set a dangerous precedent, erode investor confidence, and further politicize monetary policy. Protecting the independence of the Federal Reserve is not just an abstract principle – it’s a cornerstone of a stable and prosperous economy. Ignoring this crucial aspect could lead us down a path of increased volatility and heightened economic risk. The message is clear: central bank independence must be defended, not dismantled.

Kiyosaki makes new bold Bitcoin price prediction,https://finbold.com/r-kiyosaki-makes-new-bold-bitcoin-price-prediction/,"Personal finance author and investor Robert Kiyosaki is predicting the potential for a Bitcoin ( BTC ) rally of over 1,000% in the next 10 years. According to Kiyosaki, the maiden digital currency could trade at $1,000,000 by 2035. This forecast is backed by his deepening concern over the current state of the U.S. economy, which he believes is heading toward a depression, he said in an X post on April 19. If this price target is reached, Bitcoin will surge by approximately 1,090% from its current level of $84,900. Bitcoin one-week price chart. Source: Finbold The Rich Dad Poor Dad author pointed to historic credit card and national debt levels, rising unemployment, and weakening retirement accounts as signs of a collapse that could reshape the financial landscape, making Bitcoin a viable alternative. Kiyosaki argued that as traditional financial systems falter and fiat loses value, decentralized assets like Bitcoin offer both a hedge and a path to wealth amid global economic disruption. Bullish on gold and silver He also remains bullish on precious metals, predicting that gold will reach $30,000 and silver will hit $3,000 by 2035. Both metals have already gained 26% and 10% year to date, respectively. “I strongly believe, by 2035, that one Bitcoin will be over $ 1 million dollars. Gold will be $30k and silver $3,000 a coin. It will be the easiest money you ever made. Those who wait in fear….may be the biggest losers,” Kiyosaki stated. Central to his message is the idea that the market crash he predicted years ago is already underway. While he acknowledged the turmoil, Kiyosaki sees it as a rare opportunity for investors to build lasting wealth. The investor stressed that those who invest in Bitcoin, gold, or silver today, before the crash deepens, could emerge from the crisis far richer and more financially secure. “For those who take action today, when the crash crashes, those who invest in just one Bitcoin, or some gold, or silver…. You may come through this crisis a very rich person. It’s not too late, if you take action,” he said. Kiyosaki missed market crash calls It’s worth noting, however, that Kiyosaki has previously predicted market crashes that did not materialize, drawing criticism for those calls.

Source: @fintwit_news Still, there is lingering uncertainty in the market, with sentiment leaning toward a possible recession and stock market crash amid unease over President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Finally, the author warned that inaction and fear could lead many into poverty in the current climate. At the same time, the financial educator reiterated his message: advising investors to educate themselves, develop a plan, and make strategic moves while they still can, calling this moment a once-in-a-lifetime chance to turn economic chaos into personal prosperity.

Not quite, but a prominent macroeconomist is urging caution. Lyn Alden, a well-respected voice in the financial world, has revised her Bitcoin forecast for 2025 downwards. The culprit? None other than the potential impact of U.S. President Donald Trump’s newly announced tariffs, as reported by Cointelegraph. But before you panic sell your crypto holdings, take a deep breath. Alden isn’t abandoning her bullish stance on Bitcoin entirely. Let’s dive into what this means for the future of Bitcoin and the broader crypto market outlook . Why the Revised Bitcoin Forecast? The Trump Tariff Factor Alden, in a recent interview with Natalie Brunell, highlighted that while she remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term prospects, the introduction of tariffs by the U.S. has introduced a layer of uncertainty. These tariffs, designed to protect domestic industries, can have far-reaching consequences on global trade and financial markets. So, how exactly do Trump tariffs impact Bitcoin? Global Market Uncertainty: Tariffs can trigger trade wars, leading to volatility and instability in global markets. This uncertainty can make investors risk-averse in the short term, potentially affecting asset classes like Bitcoin. Economic Slowdown Fears: Increased tariffs can lead to higher prices for consumers and businesses, potentially slowing down economic growth. A weaker global economy can impact investor sentiment and reduce the appetite for riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Dollar Strength: Historically, tariffs can sometimes strengthen the U.S. dollar. A stronger dollar can have an inverse relationship with Bitcoin, as Bitcoin is often seen as an alternative to fiat currencies. Despite these concerns, it’s crucial to understand that Alden’s revised Bitcoin forecast isn’t a doomsday prediction. She clarified that even with the tariff headwinds, she still anticipates Bitcoin to close the year above its current level of around $85,000. This indicates a tempered, yet still positive, outlook. Bitcoin Price Prediction : Still Aiming for $100,000? The million-dollar question (or should we say, the $100,000 question?) – is the coveted $100,000 Bitcoin price prediction still on the table for 2024? According to Alden, the possibility remains strong. While the tariffs have introduced a degree of caution, she believes Bitcoin has a “good chance” of hitting that psychological milestone by the end of the year. What fuels this continued optimism? Alden points to several key factors that could act as tailwinds for Bitcoin, potentially offsetting the negative impacts of tariffs: Major Liquidity Events: Alden emphasizes the potential for significant liquidity injections into the market. These could stem from various sources: U.S. Bond Market Breakdown: If the U.S. bond market experiences instability, it could trigger a flight to safety, potentially benefiting Bitcoin as a decentralized alternative. Federal Reserve Intervention: In times of economic stress, the Federal Reserve might step in with measures like yield curve control or quantitative easing (QE). These actions increase the money supply, which can be bullish for Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. Bitcoin’s 24/7 Trading: Unlike traditional markets with fixed trading hours, Bitcoin operates around the clock. This 24/7 nature can amplify volatility, especially during periods of financial turmoil. While volatility can be a double-edged sword, in times of crisis, it can also lead to rapid price appreciation as investors seek refuge in Bitcoin. Lyn Alden’s Macro Perspective: Echoes of the Past? To further contextualize her crypto market outlook , Alden draws parallels between the current macroeconomic environment and the 2003–2007 cycle. This period, preceding the global financial crisis, was characterized by: Rising Interest Rates: Similar to today, interest rates were on an upward trajectory during that time. Economic Expansion: The U.S. economy experienced a period of growth. Eventual Market Correction: The cycle culminated in a significant market downturn. Alden suggests that even if U.S. stocks face challenges in the current environment, Bitcoin could still outperform. This is partly due to its nature as a nascent asset class with a different set of drivers compared to traditional equities. Its limited supply and decentralized nature make it a unique entity in the financial landscape. Navigating the Uncertainties: Actionable Insights So, what should crypto investors take away from Lyn Alden’s analysis and revised Bitcoin forecast ? Stay Informed, But Don’t Panic: Alden’s adjustment is a recalibration, not a complete reversal of her positive outlook. Tariffs introduce uncertainty, but they don’t negate the fundamental drivers of Bitcoin’s value proposition. Monitor Macroeconomic Events: Keep a close watch on developments related to trade policies, inflation, and central bank actions. These factors will play a significant role in shaping the crypto market outlook . Consider Bitcoin’s Long-Term Potential: Alden’s long-term bullish thesis on Bitcoin remains intact. Short-term volatility and adjustments are part of the journey in a nascent market. Focus on the bigger picture and Bitcoin’s potential as a store of value and a hedge against monetary debasement. Diversification and Risk Management: As always, diversification remains key. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Manage your risk appropriately and only invest what you can afford to lose. Conclusion: A Cautiously Optimistic Path Forward for Bitcoin Lyn Alden’s revised Bitcoin forecast serves as a reminder that even in the seemingly unstoppable world of crypto, external factors can and do influence price movements. Trump tariffs have injected a dose of caution into the crypto market outlook , prompting a tempered, but not pessimistic, view from the macroeconomist. While the path to $100,000 might be slightly more uncertain now, the underlying potential of Bitcoin and the possibility of significant liquidity events keep the dream alive. For investors, the key is to remain informed, adaptable, and prepared for potential volatility, while keeping a focus on the long-term transformative potential of Bitcoin.

After China’s central bank injected a massive 250.5 billion yuan into the economy to boost liquidity, crypto Twitter hasn’t shut up about what this could mean for digital assets. Traditional finance just got a lifeline, and the ripple effect is already hitting major tokens. While legacy coins are trying to catch a second wind, the real question is whether early buyers are paying attention to what’s brewing just under the surface—especially with up-and-coming Web3 infrastructures being built from the ground up. This isn’t about chasing the old guard anymore. Monero is pulling headlines for its resilience, and Gala is catching “very bullish” sentiment despite its flat-lined chart. But the real story isn’t just about watching these coins—it’s about recognizing what’s still on the ground floor. That’s where Qubetics ($TICS) steps in, not just reacting to market trends but flipping them with real-world utility and a bold presale model. For those keeping tabs on the top cryptocurrency to buy, this new player is starting to look more like a core portfolio move than a gamble. How Qubetics Is Solving Web3’s Messiest Problems With Real-World Utility The one thing people are sick of in crypto? Hype coins with no backbone. Qubetics came in to fix that. This isn’t just another blockchain—it’s the world’s first Web3 aggregator, blending Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and other networks into one smart, functional ecosystem. Think of it as a giant connector cable for the entire blockchain space—one that actually works without frying the system. Let’s talk use cases. A freelancer who earns in USDC on Arbitrum but wants to buy services in BNB or ETH doesn’t have to bounce between sketchy swaps anymore. With Qubetics’ Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet, they can handle everything in one place, safely and instantly. Or take an online store in Miami that wants to accept crypto from anyone worldwide—Qubetics makes that possible while auto-converting it into fiat or stablecoins for their bookkeeping. No drama. No delays. It even supports real-time conversions and virtual cards. Under the hood, Qubetics eliminates issues like data silos, scalability limits, and cross-chain security flaws. It’s made for both everyday users and enterprise-level businesses that need systems to actually work across different chains. From managing multiple networks to streamlining operations, the tech behind Qubetics isn’t just advanced—it’s user-first, and that’s a game changer for anyone looking for the top cryptocurrency to buy that doesn’t just live in theory. Qubetics Presale Is Heating Up Fast — A Top Cryptocurrency to Buy Before Stage 31 Hits The Qubetics presale is where things start to get spicy. Currently in its 30th stage, $TICS is priced at just $0.1729. Over 508 million tokens have already been sold, raising a jaw-dropping $16.2 million, and counting. There are now more than 24,900 token holders—yeah, it’s gaining traction, and fast. Here’s the kicker: every presale stage lasts only 7 days, and with each new week, the price jumps by 10%. The 31st stage? It’ll start with $TICS at $0.1902, so delaying even a day costs real money. Now let’s get into the juicy stuff—ROI. If someone threw in just $100 today at $0.1729, here’s what they could walk away with based on post-launch price targets: If $TICS hits $1: that $100 becomes $578.15 If $TICS hits $5: now it’s $2,790.44 At $10, you’re talking $5,680.88 And if it climbs to $15 after the mainnet goes live in Q2 2025? That turns into a jaw-dropping $8,571.33 This is why early participants are eyeing Qubetics as not just another altcoin, but the top cryptocurrency to buy in this cycle. The math doesn’t lie. With its strong fundamentals, real use-case potential, and a structured roadmap that actually makes sense, Qubetics is leading what many are calling the best crypto presale of the year. And remember, it’s not just about hype—it’s about timing, and that 10% weekly climb isn’t waiting on anybody. The window is narrow, and it’s closing—fast. Gala: Bullish Crowd, But Can It Bounce Back in 2025? Over on the entertainment-focused end of crypto, Gala (GALA) is riding high on community optimism. According to Binance’s sentiment data, 53.33% of users marked Gala as “Very Bullish,” making it one of the most sentiment-backed altcoins this week. Despite its current price hovering around $0.014002, the mood remains resilient. The graph, though, tells a quieter story. Gala has seen minimal movement since its post-2023 dip, and according to current projections, it’s not expected to breach any notable highs until 2029 or 2030. That means while the community’s vibes are strong, the coin is still battling stagnation on the price chart. Still, Gala holds strong potential in gaming and metaverse development, and if market liquidity from macro events (like China’s injection) stirs renewed funding into these sectors, Gala could see slow but steady recovery. That said, compared to fast-rising assets like Qubetics, Gala’s recovery curve looks more like a waiting game. Monero’s Stealth Growth Is Turning Heads—But Is It Enough? When it comes to privacy-first crypto, Monero (XMR) remains unmatched. And that’s exactly why it’s caught renewed interest in 2025. According to updated reports, Monero is projected to potentially reach up to $237.91 by year-end, and if macro shifts strengthen its case, it could even surge to $280.62 by 2026. Currently priced at $143.79, Monero is getting attention for its stealth transactions and resistance to regulation-heavy networks. The coin is showing signs of a solid long-term push, especially with technical resistance near $149 and growing volume on privacy-favored exchanges. Still, while Monero has legacy credibility, its scope remains niche. Institutional adoption and global regulations could either work in its favor—or limit its scalability. Either way, the growth trajectory is slow and steady, not explosive. And with newer chains like Qubetics offering multi-chain operability and broader utility, XMR may soon face serious competition beyond just privacy. China’s Liquidity Move Shakes Things Up—And Qubetics Offers a Level of Price Stability China’s move to inject 250.5 billion yuan into its financial system isn’t just about domestic economy—it’s a shockwave across all risk-on assets, including crypto. As capital begins flowing more freely, sentiment across major tokens like Gala and Monero is shifting—fast. But here’s the thing: both these coins are post-launch assets and fully market-dependent. Their next moves will heavily rely on global market confidence. Qubetics, on the other hand, is still in its presale phase—which means it’s not at the mercy of current volatility. In fact, its price increases by 10% every week, giving early adopters a rare window of stability and predictability. While other tokens react, Qubetics builds. And that’s a huge deal when markets get messy. This Might Be the Last Week You Can Join the Best Crypto Presale at This Price Every coin in this comparison has something going for it—Gala with its bullish community, Monero with its privacy edge, and Qubetics with its bold interoperability strategy. But only one of them is currently offering upside before it hits exchanges. Qubetics is on stage 30 of its presale, and once the clock strikes midnight Sunday, that price jumps again. With a mainnet launch just around the corner in Q2 2025 and a presale already 75% filled, this might be the last chance to join this best crypto presale while it’s still in budget territory. For those still on the sidelines, Qubetics is shaping up to be the top cryptocurrency to buy before the next market cycle kicks off. There’s a reason crypto OGs say the biggest returns come before a coin is listed. The question is: will this be another one of those “should’ve bought” moments—or the one move you actually got right? For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What makes Qubetics the top cryptocurrency to buy in 2025? Qubetics is solving real-world problems like cross-chain interoperability, scalability, and payment complexity, making it stand out as the top cryptocurrency to buy before it hits exchanges. How often does Qubetics increase its presale price? Every 7 days. At the end of each week, the token price rises by 10%, consistently rewarding early participants. Is Monero still relevant in 2025? Yes, Monero remains the top privacy coin, with strong price projections and a loyal user base, but its growth is more gradual compared to emerging altcoins like Qubetics.

Coinbase general counsel Paul Grewal stated that the pending lawsuit is an exact ”copy” of the SEC's 2023 lawsuit against the exchange, which the federal agency agreed to withdraw in February. ”In case you think I’m jumping to conclusions, the AG’s office made it clear to us that they are literally picking up where the Gary Gensler SEC left off. Seriously. This is exactly the opposite of what Americans should be focused on right now. We’ve never been closer to bipartisan legislation for digital assets and this backward lawsuit does nothing to protect consumers or solidify American leadership.” Grewal added. The lawsuit shows that the crypto industry still faces regulatory hurdles at the state level, despite several legal victories at the federal level. Opposition from state regulators could fragment cryptocurrency regulation in the U.S. and make it difficult to form a unified national policy. Several US states have withdrawn lawsuits against Coinbase following the SEC's action The SEC has changed its stance on cryptocurrencies following the resignation of former Chairman Gensler in January. His departure sparked a wave of withdrawn lawsuits, enforcement actions and investigations against cryptocurrency companies including Coinbase, Uniswap and Kraken. Several U.S. states followed the SEC's lead and also withdrew their lawsuits against Coinbase in the first quarter of this year. Vermont, one of 10 U.S. states that filed lawsuits against the exchange, withdrew its lawsuit on March 13. The legal ruling specifically cited the SEC's change in regulatory approach and the agency's creation of a cryptocurrency task force as reasons for withdrawing the suit. South Carolina rejected its lawsuit against Coinbase two weeks after Vermont withdrew its lawsuit against the exchange. The Kentucky Department of Financial Institutions became the third state-level regulator to dismiss a lawsuit against Coinbase, dismissing the litigation on March 26. Despite the legal victory, Grewal called for the federal government to end its state-by-state approach to regulating cryptocurrencies and focus on adopting clear market structure policies at the federal level.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|UNI,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-19 10:18:03

43525129,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=150954,1745058039,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Strategic Pivot: China’s ABCDE Fund Halts New Web3 Investments Amid Market Shift,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/abcde-fund-halts-web3-investment/,"The cryptocurrency world is known for its rapid shifts and strategic realignments. Recently, a significant player in the Web3 investment space, China-based ABCDE, announced a notable change in direction. Are you curious about what this means for the future of Web3 and crypto investments, particularly in the Chinese market? Let’s dive into the details of ABCDE’s recent announcement and understand the potential ripples across the digital asset landscape. Why is ABCDE Halting New Web3 Investment ? ABCDE, a prominent Web3 investment firm with roots in China and co-founded by Du Jun of Chinese cryptocurrency exchange Huobi (now HTX), has made a significant announcement. According to Du Jun’s statement on X (formerly Twitter), ABCDE is pausing new investments and putting a hold on fundraising for its second fund. This news might raise eyebrows in the crypto community, so let’s break down the key points: Investment Pause: ABCDE is no longer initiating new investments in Web3 projects. This signals a shift in their operational focus. Fundraising Halt: The firm has paused efforts to raise capital for its second fund, indicating a potential recalibration of their financial strategy. Commitment to Existing Projects: Crucially, ABCDE reassures its portfolio companies that the original team remains committed to supporting existing projects and facilitating successful exits. This is a vital point of stability for those already under ABCDE’s umbrella. Strategic Shift for Du Jun: Du Jun himself will be transitioning his focus from traditional primary market investments to strategic initiatives and deep incubation. This suggests a move towards more hands-on, long-term value creation within the Web3 ecosystem. Decoding the China Crypto Context To fully grasp the significance of ABCDE’s decision, it’s crucial to consider the broader China crypto landscape. China’s relationship with cryptocurrencies has been complex and evolving. While the nation has been a hub for crypto innovation and trading in the past, the regulatory environment has become increasingly stringent. Here’s a quick recap: Regulatory Crackdown: China has implemented significant restrictions on cryptocurrency trading and mining activities in recent years. This has led to a substantial shift in the geographical distribution of crypto businesses. Focus on Blockchain Technology: Despite the restrictions on cryptocurrencies, China has shown strong interest in blockchain technology itself. The government is actively promoting blockchain development for various applications beyond digital currencies. Web3 Ambitions: Even with crypto regulations, there’s a growing recognition of Web3’s potential. Chinese tech companies and investors are exploring opportunities within the decentralized web, albeit cautiously and within regulatory boundaries. Against this backdrop, ABCDE’s move could be interpreted as a strategic adjustment to navigate the current regulatory climate in China crypto while still contributing to the Web3 space. It’s perhaps a sign of a more measured and strategic approach to Web3 investments in the region. What is the Future of the ABCDE Fund ? The announcement might lead some to wonder about the future trajectory of the ABCDE fund . While new investments are paused, it’s essential to understand what this doesn’t mean. Here’s what we can infer about the fund’s future: Aspect Details Existing Portfolio Support ABCDE remains committed to supporting its current portfolio of Web3 projects. This includes operational support, strategic guidance, and assistance with exit strategies. Strategic Initiatives & Deep Incubation Du Jun’s personal focus shift indicates a move towards more strategic and hands-on involvement. Deep incubation suggests a commitment to nurturing projects from an early stage, potentially focusing on fundamental technology and long-term growth rather than rapid scaling. Industry Collaboration Emphasis on fostering industry collaboration points to a broader ecosystem-building approach. This could involve partnerships, joint ventures, and initiatives to strengthen the Web3 community. Long-Term Value Creation The focus on long-term value creation signals a patient approach. Instead of chasing quick gains, ABCDE might be prioritizing sustainable growth and impactful contributions to the Web3 space. In essence, the ABCDE fund isn’t shutting down; it’s evolving. It appears to be transitioning from aggressive expansion to a more focused and strategic phase, emphasizing quality over quantity in its Web3 engagements. Impact on Crypto Fundraising and Web3 Startups ABCDE’s decision to pause new investments and fundraising can have broader implications for crypto fundraising and Web3 startups, particularly those seeking funding in the Asian market. Consider these potential impacts: Investor Sentiment: Such announcements can sometimes impact investor sentiment. Other funds and investors might reassess their strategies in light of ABCDE’s move, potentially leading to a temporary cooling in certain segments of the Web3 investment market. Funding Landscape Shift: A pause from a significant investor like ABCDE could create a gap in the funding landscape, especially for early-stage Web3 projects. Startups may need to become more resourceful and explore alternative funding avenues. Focus on Sustainability: On the positive side, this shift might encourage a greater focus on project sustainability and fundamental value creation. Web3 startups may need to demonstrate stronger business models and long-term viability to attract investment in a potentially more selective funding environment. Regional Dynamics: The impact might be more pronounced in regions where ABCDE has been particularly active. Startups in China and across Asia might need to adapt their fundraising strategies to account for these changes. What Does This Mean for the Web3 Strategy Moving Forward? ABCDE’s strategic pivot raises questions about the evolving Web3 strategy for investment firms and the broader industry. Is this a temporary adjustment, or does it signal a more fundamental shift in approach? Here are some possible interpretations: Maturity of the Market: The Web3 market is maturing. Early hype cycles are giving way to a more pragmatic assessment of long-term potential. Investors might be becoming more discerning, favoring projects with solid fundamentals and clear paths to adoption. Regulatory Adaptation: Navigating the evolving global regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies and Web3 is becoming increasingly important. Investment firms might be adopting more cautious and compliant strategies to mitigate regulatory risks. Focus on Incubation and Ecosystem Building: A shift towards deep incubation and industry collaboration suggests a move beyond simply deploying capital. Building robust ecosystems and nurturing projects from the ground up could be seen as a more sustainable long-term Web3 strategy . Long-Term Vision: The emphasis on long-term value creation indicates a patient and strategic vision. Instead of chasing short-term gains, investors might be focusing on building foundational infrastructure and supporting projects with the potential to reshape the future of the internet. Ultimately, ABCDE’s strategic pivot is a noteworthy development in the Web3 space. While it might signal a temporary pause in aggressive investment activity, it also points towards a potentially more mature, strategic, and ecosystem-focused approach to Web3 investment and development.

Strategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor is reaffirming his strong belief in Bitcoin, calling it the most important investment idea of the 21st century. In a recent public appearance , Saylor described Bitcoin as the best expression of digital transformation, citing its finite supply and structural advantages over traditional assets.

Why Does Saylor Link Bitcoin to Digital Transformation? Saylor argued that the economic growth of the past three decades has been powered by digital transformation across sectors.

Despite shifts across the market, no other crypto asset has demonstrated the same long-term resilience, adoption, or staying power. Whether during periods of high volatility or in moments of recovery, BTC has consistently stood at the top. Meanwhile, XRP has been a close contender, often regarded as a leader in the payments space. But with new entrants gaining traction, some analysts suggest its reign in that category may be nearing an end. The crypto landscape is changing—and it’s opening the door for fresh, fast-moving projects to rise through the ranks. LIMITED SPOTS — JOIN 2025’S BIGGEST PRESALE!

What sets this proposal apart is its unique approach—besides holding spot TRX, the fund intends to stake a portion of its holdings to generate yield. According to data from StakingRewards.com, TRX currently offers an annualized staking yield of around 4.5%. This built-in return potential could make the ETF especially appealing to investors seeking passive income in addition to crypto exposure. TRX, which sits at a market capitalization of over $22 billion according to CoinMarketCap, is the native currency of the Tron blockchain—a proof-of-stake network founded by entrepreneur Justin Sun. While filings for altcoin ETFs are becoming increasingly common, Canary’s proactive inclusion of staking in its initial application is rare. Typically, firms wait to gain approval for holding spot tokens before requesting permission to stake. For instance, ETFs tracking Ethereum have been waiting for regulatory clarity on staking well after securing approval to hold the asset itself. SEC Lawsuit Still Looms Over Tron Founder The filing does come with its share of controversy. In March 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against Tron founder Justin Sun , accusing him of artificially pumping the prices of TRX and BitTorrent’s BTT token. Notably, both parties have since agreed to pause the proceedings as they explore a potential settlement. Still, the legal cloud adds an element of uncertainty that could influence regulatory decisions on the proposed fund. Despite the legal scrutiny, the ETF filing reflects a growing willingness among asset managers to experiment with newer and less conventional tokens. Since the beginning of 2024, Canary has been aggressively expanding its crypto ETF ambitions , seeking approval for products tied to a variety of altcoins including Litecoin, XRP, Hedera, and even niche tokens like Pengu (PENGU) and Axelar (AXL). Investor Caution Lingers Over Non-Core Crypto ETFs However, not everyone is convinced this trend will gain serious traction. Some analysts believe the flood of altcoin ETF proposals may struggle to gain meaningful assets under management. “Most crypto ETFs will fail to attract AUM and cost issuers money,” warned Alex Krüger, a well-known crypto economist, in a recent post on X. Still, Canary’s TRX ETF proposal could be a litmus test for how far the SEC is willing to go in recognizing altcoin-based investment vehicles—especially those aiming to unlock additional value through staking.

As BTC.D breaks below a key support level, analysts are eyeing a potential shift in momentum from Bitcoin to altcoins. For many, this could mark the beginning of a new altcoin season. Excited? We are too! Dive in. Market Cap Volatility Marks a Wild April April kicked off with a total crypto market cap of $2.63 trillion. But the first half of the month brought major volatility. Between April 5 and 7, the market dropped sharply by 9.8%, hitting a low of $2.31 trillion. It didn’t stay there long—between April 9 and 12, the market bounced back, climbing 11.71%. As of now, total market cap sits at $2.65 trillion, still 5.2% below this month’s high. Altcoins Follow the Trend Altcoins mirrored Bitcoin’s moves, but with some promising signs. The altcoin market started April at $991.26 billion, then dropped to $831.83 billion by April 7. From April 9 to 12, it rebounded 11.6%. Today, the altcoin market cap is around $958.43 billion – about 7.8% below the April peak. Bitcoin Dominance Rejected at Resistance Looking at the four-hour chart, Bitcoin dominance peaked at 63.98% on April 7, meeting strong resistance. It briefly broke above that level on April 16 but quickly fell back. BTC.D now sits at 63.83%. If this trend continues, Bitcoin dominance could retest the monthly low of 63.16%—a move that could fuel even more optimism around altcoins.

Since April 16, the altcoin market has grown by 1.99%. Interestingly, when Bitcoin dropped from $84,936.62 to $84,479.38, the alt market climbed from $947.58 billion to $948.94 billion. Top altcoins are already showing strength: Ethereum (ETH) up 0.85% XRP up 0.6% BNB up 0.7% Solana (SOL) up 2.7% Dogecoin (DOGE) up 2.1% Cardano (ADA) up 2.1% As Bitcoin dominance shows signs of weakening and top altcoins begin to climb, traders are watching closely. If this momentum holds, we could be at the start of a strong altcoin cycle. Momentum is building beneath the surface, and the market may be closer to a full altcoin breakout than it seems. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

During mid-week trading, the altcoin rose nearly 1% on the day and over 2% across the past week, climbing to $2.09. While the broader crypto market is gaining traction—with a 1% uptick pushing the global market cap to $2.69 trillion—XRP is once again outperforming thanks to renewed legal clarity and a surge in institutional buzz. SEC Deal Clears the Air—And Clears the Path; XRP Supported? Much of this renewed confidence comes from Ripple’s long-awaited settlement with the SEC. After a four-year legal tug-of-war, Ripple agreed to a $50 million penalty —down significantly from the originally proposed $125 million. That move lifted a massive cloud that had been hanging over Ripple for years. But that’s not all. Ripple also gets to reclaim $75 million that had been locked in escrow, signaling a fresh start and putting more strategic capital back into Ripple’s ecosystem. “This was a turning point,” said Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, adding that the deal will likely unlock new waves of institutional interest. $XRP shows top-tier liquidity, and with recent legal wins against the #SEC + a $50M settlement, it's looking like a strong candidate for a spot ETF.

Plus, a potential leadership shift at the SEC could bring a friendlier… pic.twitter.com/pjHdtSoEdJ — Nicole (@Baby0_Nicole) April 17, 2025 Adding to the excitement, political tailwinds have kicked in. The Trump administration’s pro-crypto stance—coupled with Ripple’s growing connections in Washington—has strengthened XRP’s legitimacy. There’s even chatter about Ripple being considered for the U.S. government’s crypto reserve. That kind of speculation is fueling investor optimism in a big way. On-chain activity tells the story too: Active XRP addresses surged from 16,000 to over 100,000 following the legal resolution and political support. Ripple has now reclaimed its spot as the second-largest altcoin by market cap, valued at a hefty $125.8 billion. XRP’s ETF Momentum and Institutional Demand Grow The buzz doesn’t stop at politics or lawsuits. ETF speculation is adding fuel to the fire. Multiple XRP ETF proposals are under SEC review, and analysts are increasingly confident that 2025 might be the year one gets approved. BREAKING XRP GOES INSTITUTIONAL IN ASIA.

That move is seen as a major milestone in XRP’s journey toward institutional legitimacy. Technical Setup: XRP Poised for a Breakout? XRP’s price action is hinting at something big. The charts show a descending triangle formation—a setup that often precedes a bullish breakout. XRP Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Currently trading at $2.09, XRP is flirting with a key resistance zone between $2.20 and $2.23, where both the 50-day and 100-day EMAs are clustered. A breakout above this range could open the door to $2.50, and possibly even a retest of $3 to $4.50 over time. MACD: Flipping bullish, histogram turning green RSI: Neutral at 51—leaving plenty of room for upside Whale Activity: Still strong, signaling smart money accumulation Funding Rates: Positive on Binance, a bullish sign Bottom line: If XRP can flip $2.20 into support, this rally could have legs. XRP Trade Setup For new traders looking to join the action, here’s a simple, risk-managed plan: Entry: Buy above $2.10 with strong volume Target: First target at $2.21, extended to $2.33 Stop Loss: Below $2.05 support zone Tip: Watch for a solid candle close above $2.10. Volume confirmation matters. Without it, the move could fizzle out. If XRP holds above $2.05 and bulls step in with conviction, a push through resistance is very possible. But if that level fails, the setup weakens—so stay nimble. Final Thoughts Between the SEC settlement, rising institutional interest, ETF momentum, and an improving technical picture, XRP is one of the most talked-about altcoins right now—and for good reason. If bulls can hold support and flip key resistance levels, XRP might just be gearing up for its next major move. $SUBBD Token: Your VIP Pass to the Future of AI-Powered Content The content creator economy is worth $85B—and $SUBBD is aiming to flip it on its head.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a classic example—what started as a meme coin eventually made headlines with its explosive price movement, turning early micro-investments into multi-million-dollar fortunes. But for many, SHIB’s meteoric rise is already in the rearview mirror. The real question now is: what’s next? Enter Mutuum Finance (MUTM)—a token still flying under the radar, currently priced at just $0.025 during its presale phase. Unlike meme coins chasing fleeting attention, MUTM is quietly gaining the attention of large holders and DeFi-focused investors because of what it’s building behind the scenes. And that difference in approach might be exactly what gives it long-term strength. SHIB captured the market with hype, community energy, and viral marketing. Its rapid ascent was driven by speculation and social sentiment more than actual utility. While that kind of breakout was exciting, repeating it becomes less likely as investor expectations shift toward real products, actual use cases, and sustainable economics. Today, SHIB is facing a consolidation phase. Its price has cooled, and while it still enjoys strong community support, many investors—especially larger ones—are turning their attention to earlier-stage opportunities that offer long-term growth rooted in functionality. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance isn’t trying to replicate a meme-driven rise. Instead, it’s focused on delivering actual value through a decentralized protocol that supports crypto lending and borrowing. The platform offers users two ways to engage: by supplying digital assets to earn interest or by locking collateral to borrow funds. At the heart of this system is the mtToken model. When users deposit assets, they receive mtTokens—ERC-20 tokens that represent their share of the pool and accumulate interest over time. These tokens remain fully transferable, giving users flexibility without sacrificing yield. MUTM also introduces a revenue redistribution mechanism. A portion of platform revenue is used to buy MUTM tokens from the open market, which are then distributed to mtToken holders. This creates sustained buy pressure while rewarding participation, aligning long-term incentives for early users. Mutuum Finance isn’t all talk—the team is building real infrastructure. A smart contract audit by CertiK is already underway, which adds a layer of trust as the platform prepares to scale. There’s also a user dashboard already live, and a beta version of the lending platform is expected to launch by the time MUTM lists on major exchanges. In addition, the team is working on an overcollateralized stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar. This stablecoin will be minted only when enough collateral is locked, making it a secure and reliable tool within the ecosystem. It’s an essential step toward adding more liquidity options and expanding utility across the platform. These are the kinds of developments that whales pay attention to—not just price charts, but real progress. With over $6.8 million already raised and more than 8,300 on-chain holders, Mutuum Finance is clearly resonating with a growing user base. Yet, the current price of $0.025 still leaves massive upside on the table. Analysts project that MUTM will hit $2.50 or more by late 2025—a surge of 100x from today’s levels. Even in the near term, just reaching $0.45 shortly after launch represents a staggering 1,700% increase from the current presale price. For a $500 investment now, that could mean a value of $8,500 post-launch—without relying on hype or speculation, but purely from platform growth and demand. Unlike SHIB, which saw its largest investors jump in after momentum had already begun, MUTM is attracting high-value wallets before its listings. That’s a signal. Smart money tends to position itself where utility, infrastructure, and timing align—and that’s exactly what Mutuum Finance offers right now. There’s even a $100,000 giveaway running for early participants, giving users an added reason to get involved before the broader crypto market catches on. Mutuum Finance isn’t a meme. It’s a real protocol with a defined use case, a growing ecosystem, and a roadmap that’s already in motion. The fact that it hasn’t gone parabolic like SHIB yet is what makes it attractive. Because when it does, those already holding will be the ones to benefit most. And at $0.025, that entry is still available—for now.

The DeFi protocol Genius Yield, built on Cardano, has approved a critical proposal—F12 Catalyst—that sets protocols for onboarding assets as well as validation. This milestone will provide a secure and trustworthy platform for RWA trading on the blockchain. The architecture includes robust audit mechanisms for assets and ownership verification, both of which are required to ensure authenticity and safeguard investors. Next Steps: Onboarding Portal and Token Issuance Following approval, Genius Yield will develop a digital onboarding portal for asset owners. This portal will facilitate listing real-world assets on-chain. After onboarding, the project will implement token issuance protocols and develop a reward system to encourage participation. These efforts pave the way for an expansion of the RWA trading platform . RWA Market Aims for $2 Trillion by 2030 Genius Yield is not the only endeavor within Cardano’s RWA program. Initiatives such as Empowa and Tiamonds are also propelling the utilization of tokenized assets. Empowa is aimed at Africa’s real estate market, while Tiamonds allows for the trading of fractionalized diamond holdings. The total RWA market is growing very rapidly. Brickken reports that $50 billion in assets were tokenized as of March 2025, of which real estate alone accounted for $30 billion. McKinsey estimates the total RWA market to be as high as $2 trillion in 2030. Real-World Assets: A Breakthrough Use Case for Crypto RWAs are becoming increasingly popular as one of the most interesting uses in crypto. By tokenizing real-world assets like property, art, or commodities, they allow for fractional ownership and liquidity in otherwise unaccessible markets . Cardano’s recent move is strengthening its commitment to building a scalable and secure space for these real-world use cases—paving the way for broader adoption and real utility.",Altcoins|Blockchain|Regulation,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-04-19 10:39:33

A fresh digital asset known as Codename:Pepe, built around internet‑meme humor and artificial‑intelligence tools, is aiming for a $5 billion market value as the current crypto upswing gains pace. Codename:Pepe joins the fast‑moving meme‑coin field but claims a difference: the coin uses AI to study market chatter, generate trade signals, and place automatic trades. That blend of jokes and data science could steer holders through the chaotic meme‑coin arena and point them toward outsized gains similar to those once seen in the PEPE token. Codename:Pepe Unleashes True Intelligence for Maximum Profits The crypto underworld is infested with fake AI agents —shady operators promising “next-gen intelligence” while barely outsmarting a toaster. This nonsense ends today. Codename:Pepe has come to denounce fake AI agents. This ultimate undercover agent’s purpose is straightforward: help users make money in the chaotic meme‑coin jungle while adding mass hilarity (and, naturally, ridiculous gains). Classified Intel: The True Identity of Codename:Pepe The project’s branding is a direct nod to the original PEPE coin, whose price shot up almost 22,000% during its early run. Codename:Pepe is a Pepe in disguise, adding that whether the new token repeats that climb depends on its community. Your Directive: Secure Your Position in the Codename:Pepe Mission To build the community, the organizers have chosen a multi‑stage presale instead of outside venture backing. Supporters are urged to secure their position in the Codename:Pepe mission with the opening round priced at $0.003333333 per token because three is a lucky number. The final presale stage lists a price of $0.151515152, producing a 98% first‑stage discount. This means buy early, pay less. Codename:Pepe Mission Explained Codename:Pepe plans to use the power of artificial intelligence to hunt down the juiciest meme coins, predict market trends, and deliver exclusive AI-powered trading signals before the FOMO kicks in. Beyond smart analysis, this genius agent will also trade for you with its fully automated AI-trader, turning those signals into sweet gains. Every great agent needs an elite organization backing them. That’s where $AGNT comes in. Holding $AGNT unlocks membership in a top-secret DAO, where operatives (investors) gain access to classified strategies, insider analytics, and the ability to vote on high-stakes missions. Holding $AGNT will unlock: Membership in a top-secret DAO Access to classified strategies Insider analytics Ability to vote on high-stakes missions Profits from the mutual DAO fund will be allocated to those who stake their $AGNT, ensuring the spoils of the trade go to the most loyal agents. Top-Secret Tokenomics (No Funny Business) This is a community-first operation, so 25% the total token supply is allocated for staking and rewards. Codename:Pepe isn’t just throwing tokens around like confetti. The supply is capped at 5 billion, ensuring no surprise inflation bombs. Further breaking down the tokemonics, only 20% of the supply is allocated for the presale. The offer at a discounted price is limited. Final Orders: Deploy Capital & Secure Your $AGNT Now This is your shot to join crypto’s most ridiculous yet lucrative mission. The best entries go to the fastest trigger fingers. Don’t be the guy who “wished he got in early.” The mission is set. The presale is live. Are you in, or will you let the AI fakes win? Buy Codename:Pepe ($AGNT) Early for a Bigger Discount From Blocks to Millions: The Potential of Bitcoin in 2025 and Beyond Bitcoin is the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, introduced in 2009 by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto. It’s a digital currency that operates without a central authority, allowing direct peer-to-peer transactions without the need for banks or governments. Bitcoin runs on blockchain technology, a public ledger where every transaction is recorded and visible to everyone. This decentralized system ensures secure and transparent transfers, eliminating the need for a central authority to verify transactions. Since its inception, Bitcoin’s price has seen dramatic changes. From being nearly worthless, it surged to record highs by 2021. In 2025, Bitcoin continues to show strong performance, drawing interest from both individual and institutional investors. Experts have bold predictions for Bitcoin’s future. Some forecast prices reaching up to $1.5 million by 2030 due to increasing adoption and its capped supply. Even more cautious estimates anticipate significant growth, emphasizing its strong potential. Considering its impressive track record and optimistic forecasts, Bitcoin appears to be an attractive option in the current market cycle. For those looking into long-term investments, Bitcoin’s potential growth could make it a compelling addition to a diversified portfolio. Conclusion As the market experiences a new surge, established coins like Bitcoin offer less potential for rapid short-term gains. Their growth is steady but doesn’t match the explosive opportunities found in emerging coins. Codename:Pepe crypto stands out by unleashing true intelligence for maximum profits. It uses advanced artificial intelligence to navigate the meme coin market and deliver significant returns. Engaging with this project could provide a chance to participate in substantial gains during this bullish phase.

Pi Coin is trading 79% lower than its all-time high price set 2 months ago. It’s also important to be careful about the ongoing Ponzi scheme allegations surrounding the coin. According to the developers, unlike traditional cryptocurrency projects that usually distribute coins via simple airdrops, the Pi Network’s migration is a much more complex process. The network aims to fairly and securely migrate tens of millions of users, or “Pioneers,” based on data collected through years of mobile mining. According to the developers, over 12 million Pioneers have already been successfully migrated to the Mainnet. The initial goal was to migrate at least 10 million users before launching Open Network, but developers noted that many users will continue to migrate even after Open Network goes live. The Pi Core Team has outlined a structured roadmap focused on three main transition phases: Completing the First Migrations: The network is currently focused on completing the first batch of migrations, which include verified core mining rewards, Security Circle rewards, lockup bonuses, utility usage rewards, and verified node rewards. Second Passes with Referral Bonuses: Second passes will begin once the first passes are complete. These will primarily include referral mining bonuses earned from team members who pass KYC. Ongoing Periodic Migrations: The final phase will feature regular migrations (likely monthly or quarterly) across all reward types to ensure long-term scalability. The developers argued that the balance displayed in the users’ interface (Transferable Balance) is a simplified estimate. The actual balance carried over involves deeper calculations that may take longer to process, given the entire mining history of each user. Related News: BREAKING: Spot ETF Application Filed for Surprise Altcoin As the transition process continues, developers have provided information about Pi’s tokenomics. Here are the details, according to the developers: Maksimum Arz: Pi, aşağıdaki şekilde tahsis edilen sabit bir maksimum 100 milyar token arzına sahip: For 65% community mining rewards 10% for foundation reserves For 5% liquidity 20% for Core Team These rates will remain consistent over time, tracking the pace of Mining Rewards being moved, allowing the Effective Total Supply to scale proportionally. For example, if 1 billion Pi tokens were moved, the Effective Total Supply would be approximately 1.538 billion tokens (calculated as 1B ÷ 65%). *This is not investment advice.

This initiative is designed to mitigate risks, strengthen investor protection, and ensure regulatory readiness before introducing official legislation. A key part of the discussion focused on safeguarding the market against illicit activities. The Minister emphasized the importance of robust compliance frameworks, including Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols, to prevent the misuse of digital assets and support the country’s financial security. In response, Ben Zhou welcomed Vietnam’s measured and responsible approach to digital asset regulation and reiterated Bybit’s long-standing commitment to compliance: “ Vietnam’s forward-thinking regulatory sandbox is a critical step toward unlocking the full potential of blockchain technology.

The exchange also proposed support in capacity building, such as training financial regulators and sharing experiences from other jurisdictions. Minister Nguyen Van Thang welcomed Bybit’s proactive approach and assigned the State Securities Commission to coordinate with Bybit on concrete proposals. He also commended Bybit’s reputation for strong financial capabilities, technological resilience, and its adherence to legal and regulatory requirements in the markets where it operates.

This Crucial Metric Says So (Details),https://cryptopotato.com/is-bitcoins-bull-market-just-getting-started-this-crucial-metric-says-so-details/,"TL;DR Although bitcoin’s price tumbled by over 20% since its January all-time high and is currently nowhere near it, a crucial metric shows that the actual cycle peak is not here yet. In terms of entry prices, though, one analyst cautioned that the current levels might not be optimal. No Peak Yet? After hitting an all-time high on January 20 this year at over $109,000, bitcoin’s price started to lose value gradually until the end of the month and then nosedived following the global economic uncertainty prompted by US President Trump’s controversial approach. The culmination came last week when BTC tumbled below $75,000 for the first time in five months. This meant that the asset had lost nearly $35,000 in less than three months. This split the community into those who believe the bull market has come to a screeching halt and those who rely on history to be more optimistic, suggesting that such substantial corrections have occurred during all previous cycles. But there are only that—corrections, and BTC will persevere. Ali Martinez, a crypto analyst with over 135,000 followers on X, brought another key metric that could support the latter. It still relies on historical performance, but it’s not focused on the technical aspects. Instead, it measures the retail activity as BTC tends to peak after a massive influx of such investors. So far, there hasn’t been a big retail wave. This is evident from the lack of Google searches as well as the missing “retail activity through trading frequency surge.” #Bitcoin $BTC market tops have historically aligned with surges in retail activity. The move from $70,000 to $110,000 lacked that, echoing the late 2021 setup. pic.twitter.com/rVJPUTpXZC — Ali (@ali_charts) April 18, 2025 Martinez noted that the current cycle resembles the 2021 run when BTC peaked in April, only to break that high at the end of the year. Don’t Rush to Buy Although history suggests there might be more gains on the horizon for BTC, Martinez published another chart that suggests investors should maybe be more patient before allocating funds to the largest digital asset. This is because of the Bitcoin Exchange inflow volume, a metric used to “spot strong entry points.” #Bitcoin $BTC exchange inflow volume momentum is a key metric for spotting strong entry points. For now, it’s signaling patience. We’re still waiting for the right opportunity to step in. pic.twitter.com/NSS1fZcHMl — Ali (@ali_charts) April 19, 2025 This essentially confirms a previous report by Glassnode, which read that the BTC market is now in a “ wait-and-see ” phase.

The market value of TRX along with USDT and USDD on its network will achieve new record values this current quarter according to Sun. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to experience growth through its fourth presale phase where it has acquired $6.9 million from 8,400 holders. Investors show strong interest in MUTM tokens priced at $0.025 because they can expect a 140% profit when the token reaches $0.06. Tron’s Steady Climb Through its active network Tron routes numerous transactions that compete with well-established blockchains. The currency value currently stands at $0.25 while technical signals predict a price jump and the price has increased by 13% in a week. The intersection between the 20-day exponential moving average and the 50-day exponential moving average signals a golden cross according to the confirmation by the MACD indicator. The resistance point at $0.266 presents an obstacle for TRX however surpassing it could bring the token price to $0.35 based on analyst projections for $0.46 by 2025. Bearing witness to TRX’s market cap expansion due to $65.7 billion USDT on his network strengthens Sun’s confidence between analysts. TRX’s movement-driven strategy exposes it to market changes since it lacks the secure foundations that newer structured portable tokens possess. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Surge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) rapidly progresses through its fourth presale stage offering tokens at the price point of $0.025. Through its fundraising activity Mutuum Finance has acquired $6.9 million from 412 million token sales while increasing its holder base to reach 8,400 individuals. Phase 5 will introduce a price increase to $0.03 to yield current investors a total of 20% more value. At the $0.06 launch price the tokenomics provide investors with a 140% return yet experts forecast the token price to rise to $3.50 which offers a 13,900% ROI potential. A current $1000 investment holds potential to expand into $140000. A Certik smart contract audit currently undergoes finalization at the team’s end before sharing results on social media platforms will strengthen trust in the platform. The ordered movement of MUTM in the crypto market space makes it stand out from other tokens. Innovative Lending Model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) unionizes peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer lending functions to let users obtain passive income by loaning assets and securing loans with collateral. The platform operates through liquidity pools which receive deposited USDT from lenders and simultaneously supports borrowing functions through borrowers who lock in assets above their collateral requirement to maintain stability. Users who accumulate mtTokens from the platform such as mtETH can earn passive income through them. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presented an update in the form of dashboard Top 50 holders which rewards participants with bonus tokens based on their ranking. The buy-and-distribute system allocates revenue from the platform to acquire MUTM tokens which subsequently distribute rewards to token staking contributors to increase demand. The model combines a $100,000 giveaway for early investors to drive phase 4 sell-out emphasis as the launch date nears completion. Final Thoughts By implementing its fast transaction capabilities together with Sun’s enthusiastic leadership vision Tron (TRX) will secure one of the top five cryptocurrency positions in 2025. The MUTM token delivered from Mutuum Finance (MUTM) shines brighter than TRX because it holds significant potential to soar by 22,320% until reaching $5.60.

Strong U.S. job data and growing expectations of interest rate cuts are pushing investors to move away from traditional stocks and toward Bitcoin. Even as big tech stocks struggle, Bitcoin continues to show strength. Can BTC Break $84.9K? Bulls Target $87K Next Bitcoin’s short-term outlook looks promising. If the price manages to break above $84,900, analysts say the next key target could be $87,000. So far, buyers are in control, and as long as that holds, the uptrend is expected to continue. Benjamin Cowen’s Bullish Outlook for Bitcoin Popular crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen believes that Bitcoin’s biggest move this cycle may still be in the cards. In a bullish scenario, he sees the price potentially hitting $200,000. More realistically, he expects a cycle top between $120,000 and $150,000 — but likely later in the cycle. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Altcoin Season Coming Soon as BTC Dominance Rejected at Key Level , $72K Is Key Support — Can It Hold? One of the most important levels to watch is Bitcoin’s 2024 high near $72,000. According to Cowen, holding this level on the weekly chart is essential to keep the bullish trend intact. While BTC hasn’t retested this zone yet, if it does, strong buying interest is expected to step in. Calm Market, But Bulls Still in the Lead At the moment, Bitcoin is trading around $84,483, with little movement in the past 24 hours. Cowen remains cautiously optimistic. He notes that if a pullback happens, it will serve as a key test for the market’s strength. If BTC continues to hold above major levels, it could set the stage for a stronger rally later this year. Cowen’s outlook remains bullish in the long term, with a possible move into six-figure territory . But for that to happen, Bitcoin needs to keep its momentum. For now, the bulls are holding steady — but the real test may still be ahead. With key levels holding firm and sentiment shifting, Bitcoin’s next move could set the tone for the rest of the cycle. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Bitcoin Breaks Out of Triangle—Momentum Builds Above $85K Bitcoin (BTC/USD) has broken out of a symmetrical triangle pattern on the 2-hour chart, signaling a fresh wave of bullish momentum. Currently trading near $85,280, the breakout above $85,508 comes on the back of rising volume and a MACD crossover, reinforcing upward pressure. The price is holding above the 50-period EMA at $84,509, which now acts as short-term support. For new traders, this setup suggests a continuation move toward $86,385 and potentially $87,036 in the near term. A pullback to retest the $85,500 level may offer a favorable risk-reward entry. Trade Setup: Entry: On confirmed support above $85,500 Target: $86,385, then $87,036 Stop Loss: Below $84,500 BTC Bull Token Presale Tops $4.76M as Bitcoin Hovers Near $85K As Bitcoin edges closer to the $85,000 mark and macro uncertainty intensifies, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) continues to gain traction with retail and crypto-savvy investors. This Ethereum-based meme coin stands out by offering real Bitcoin airdrops every time BTC hits key price milestones—aligning directly with Bitcoin’s long-term upside. Earn Bitcoin with 86% APY Through Staking Beyond the airdrop rewards, BTC Bull’s staking program remains a major draw. Investors can earn up to 86% APY in passive income, while also contributing to the token’s network strength. The ability to unstake anytime makes it flexible for new and seasoned holders alike.

Peter Brandt Predicts Drop to $800 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Veteran trader Peter Brandt has surprised the community with his bold prediction for Ethereum. He predicts that Ethereum could fall back to $800 and shared a chart showing a descending triangle pattern, which is a bearish pattern that often signals about a bigger price drop ahead. Currently, the key support level is around $1,500. If ETH falls below this level, Brandt believes it could crash all the way down to around $800, similar to its 2022 low. Brandt’s prediction comes as ETH continues to struggle with resistance and market uncertainty. ETHUSD pic.twitter.com/pi73odO96z — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) April 18, 2025 Ethereum Having A Rough Time Ether has had a rough year dropping over 46% over the past 12 months. This week, it dipped 4% after the Fed announced that it would keep the interest rates unchanged, following Bitcoin’s drop. When brandt posted his prediction, Ether was trading at $1,587. It is currently trading at $1,596, up over 0.8% in the past day. Previously, Peter Brandt slammed the Ethereum as “worthless junk”. Recently, Scottie Pippen, the famous NBA player, predicted that the biggest altcoin season will start this Sunday, following a historical pattern after Bitcoin halvings. He is optimistic over Ether as he is building a project focused on AI, gaming, and tokenizing real-world assets. Meanwhile, Justin Sun, the founder of Tron will keep its Ethereum holdings and work with Ethereum developers to improve the crypto space. XRP Flips Ether in FDV Besides, XRP has recently surpassed Ethereum in terms of fully diluted market cap (FDV). As of April 2025, XRP’s FDV stands at approximately $208.4 billion, while Ether’s is around $192.5 billion. However, its worthwhile to know that FDV represents the total value of all possible tokens including the ones not yet in circulation. However, Ethereum still maintains a higher actual market cap based on its circulating supply. HISTORIC: $XRP FLIPS $ETH After 6 straight months of outperforming #Ethereum , #XRP has officially become the second-largest asset by fully diluted market cap. The numbers? • XRP: $208.4B • ETH: $192.5B No hype. No dreams. Just onchain facts. pic.twitter.com/FcO5p4UCEF — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) April 18, 2025 XRP’s FDV has surged as a result of positive regulatory developments, increased institutional interest, and its growing role in cross-border payments. Although Ether faces challenges from competing blockchains and changes in its tokenomics after recent upgrades, it continues to lead in actual market cap and remains a dominant force in the crypto ecosystem. Analyst Ali Martinez in a recent X post highlighted that Ether is currently stuck between two key price levels: $1,540 and $1,630. He notes that a breakout in either direction will determine whether Ethereum moves higher or lower in price. #Ethereum $ETH is currently trading between two major supply zones: $1,540 and $1,630.

Chainlink (LINK), currently trading around $12, continues to dominate the oracle, with growing adoption in DeFi and traditional finance pushing it toward a potential spot in the top 5. But it’s Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that’s catching early investor buzz. Presale phase 4 has started since the third phase sold out more quickly than anticipated. The fundraising has surpassed $6.9 million while drawing in more than 8400 holders. Investors currently purchase at $0.025 with the understanding that the price will reach $0.03 after phase 5 begins. The current investors stand to gain a 140% return on investment before the project begins trading at $0.06. MUTM combines fresh tech with top-tier tokenomics, giving it a real shot at becoming the next breakout performer and possibly a future top 10 name. Mutuum Finance Presale Soars as Investor Interest Grows Mutuum Finance obtained popularity among the decentralized lending sector because its dual-lending model brings fresh ideas to the market. Mutuum Finance earned quick marketplace adoption following its presale start-up because investors from more than 8,400 participants contributed $6.9 million. Investors can make profits from the Phase 5 price rise of Mutuum Finance tokens from $0.025 during Phase 4 to $0.03. Experts identify Mutuum Finance as the least valued DeFi startup for present times and foresee an anticipated value surpassing $1 during public distribution. In a recent update, Mutuum Finance introduced an interactive dashboard that displays a real-time leaderboard, highlighting the top 50 token holders. These investors won’t just get recognized, they’ll also earn bonus tokens for maintaining their spot on the leaderboard. Shaking Up the DeFi Game with a Hybrid Lending Strategy What distinguishes Mutuum Finance is its trailblazing combination of two extremely impactful lending models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). While the P2C model allows users to invest in liquidity pools and earn passive income in the way of automatic smart contract lending in USDT, the P2P model allows users to lend and borrow directly from each other, cutting out the middleman. Through the integration of these two models, Mutuum Finance brings a new degree of security, efficiency, and decentralization to the DeFi market, making it an attractive option for investors looking for high-yield investments. Building a Secure and Stable Ecosystem In order to offer long-term stability, Mutuum Finance is launching a totally collateralized, USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum network. In contrast to earlier algorithmic stablecoins that have been difficult, this stablecoin will be over-collateralized, reducing risk and enhancing confidence. Open financial architectures and audited smart contracts are also employed by the platform in order to eliminate the vulnerabilities that have weakened other DeFi projects. Reward Early Investors and Expand the Community Mutuum Finance strives to enhance its network of users through profitable incentive systems. The $100,000 giveaway divides 10 rewards of $10,000 MUTM tokens while the referral system provides bonuses for successful individual and organizational referrals. Platform users who join early will gain access to exclusive staking pools while also receiving governance voting rights and VIP information updates that keep them involved on the platform for extended periods. While Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Chainlink (LINK) have proven their value, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly gaining attention as a potential top performer. With over $6.9 million raised in its presale and 8,400+ holders, the project is set for significant growth. Investors can see a 140% return before it even hits exchanges, thanks to its unique dual-lending model and strong tokenomics. Now is the time to get involved, don’t miss out on this opportunity to be part of the next big thing in DeFi.

It is also the only altcoin with an approved spot ETF in the US, and numerous upgrades are lined up to improve its speed and reduce transaction costs. Despite these strengths, Ethereum’s price remains suppressed, leading to growing speculation: is this just market sentiment at play, or could it reflect coordinated manipulation to shake out weak hands before a reversal? As Ethereum continues to dominate the utility narrative in crypto, many long-term holders see this downturn as a strategic accumulation zone, while others brace for more downside. Ethereum Fundamentals Shine Despite Bearish Market Conditions Ethereum is facing a critical test as it trades near major demand levels while macroeconomic uncertainty deepens. Global tensions persist as US President Donald Trump escalates his trade war with China. The recent 90-day tariff pause for all countries except China has done little to ease market fears. As economic pressure builds between the world’s two largest economies, investors are increasingly turning away from high-risk assets like crypto, driving volatility across digital markets. Ethereum, like the broader crypto market, has suffered under this weight. The asset is now hovering just above bear market lows after a prolonged decline, prompting concerns over its short-term price action. Yet, despite the technical weakness, Pillows points to Ethereum’s strong fundamentals as a reason to remain optimistic. According to Pillows, Ethereum remains the backbone of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. It processes over 95% of all stablecoin transactions, commands the highest Total Value Locked (TVL), and leads the charge in Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization. It’s also the only altcoin the US has approved for a spot ETF, adding institutional legitimacy. With several protocol upgrades ahead aimed at improving scalability and reducing costs, Pillows believes Ethereum’s current valuation could represent a long-term buying opportunity. As he puts it: if you believe in fundamentals, ETH remains the top bet among altcoins. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Stalls In Tight Range – Big Price Move Incoming? ETH Price Stuck In Range: Bulls Eye $1,800 Breakout Ethereum is trading at $1,590 after several days of choppy price action between $1,500 and $1,700. The market remains stuck in this narrow range as bulls struggle to regain momentum amid broader macroeconomic uncertainty. The inability to reclaim key resistance zones has kept ETH under pressure, and a decisive breakout is needed to shift sentiment. Bulls are currently eyeing the 4-hour 200-day Moving Average (MA) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA), both sitting near the $1,800 level. Reclaiming this zone would mark a major short-term victory for buyers and could signal the beginning of a recovery phase. A clean break above $1,800 would also invalidate the current lower-high structure and potentially drive ETH toward higher supply areas near $2,000.

If Ethereum fails to hold above current support levels and dips below $1,550, the next leg could send the asset beneath the $1,500 mark. For now, the $1,500–$1,800 corridor defines Ethereum’s battleground, and traders are closely watching for a breakout that sets the next major direction.

Whales are back on the offensive, and the declining sentiment could result in price reversal in the short term. 3 Factors Say Yey ETH Data from Lookonchain suggests that Ethereum whales have reversed their strategy and have started to accumulate once again. The analytics platform outlined an address linked to Metalpha that has purchased roughly $50 million worth of the second-largest digital asset since April 1. Another one withdrew almost $100 million in ETH out of GateIo, and a third one transferred more than 10,000 ETH from Bybit. Whales are accumulating $ETH ! A wallet linked to Metalpha has withdrawn 29,000 $ETH ($48.73M) from #Binance since Apr 1. 0xd81E has withdrawn 46,577 $ETH ($97.26M) from #Gateio since Feb 15. 0x6034 has withdrawn 10,091 $ETH ($18.8M) from #Bybit since Mar 12.… pic.twitter.com/yUXpsLTjQm — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 18, 2025 Whales accumulating again is a good sign for the underlying asset, as it reduces the immediate selling pressure and could lead to FOMO among smaller investors. The second positive sign for ETH’s future price performance is the Market Cap to Realized Cap (MVRV) Price Band. The metric is used to determine the “best” buying opportunities when Ethereum dips below it, which is the current situation. The best #Ethereum $ETH buying opportunities have historically occurred when price dips below the lower MVRV Price Band, and that’s exactly where it is now! pic.twitter.com/qVg9R2ewpe — Ali (@ali_charts) April 19, 2025 Rain told their 100,000 followers on X that Ethereum’s cycles tend to repeat themselves in a compelling manner. Basing their findings on the historical sentiment around the largest altcoins, the analyst determined that ETH will reclaim its strength and aim at $10,000 and beyond. This will shift the entire market structure, which includes “new narratives, new capital rotation, and new leaders.” Is It Already Different? Just a few days ago, CryptoPotato reported that different types of investors had sold off substantial portions of their ETH holdings. These included whales, Galaxy Digital, smaller investors, and those who entered through the ETFs. However, the information above, including the accumulation by whales, suggests that the ETH market has reached an exhaustion point. After all, the asset is down by 60% since its December 2024 peak. For comparison, BTC, which actually managed to break its previous ATH, is down by only 22% since the January high.

According to Pompliano, if Trump decides to follow through on the move, he will set a dangerous precedent, especially considering the motive behind the move. Pompliano agrees with the critics that the Federal Reserve is not truly independent but notes that firing the Chairman will only just make things worse. “I do not believe that the President of the United States should come in and unilaterally fire the Fed President,” Pompliano said in a video posted on X.

I answer your questions 👇 pic.twitter.com/S7Q6hANR3H — Anthony Pompliano 🌪 (@APompliano) April 18, 2025 The warning came after the US President took to his social media platform Truth Social to accuse Jerome Powell of wasting time before cutting interest rates. “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” Trump said in the post. In reaction, Pompliano mentioned that where there is a disagreement and a firing ensues, it is not an area that the United States is supposed to go to. “The idea of firing the Fed chairman is a very bad precedent to set this way,” he said. Pompliano warns against bad precedent if Powell is axed Pompliano said, “The Fed, I think, is highly politicized, even though they pretend not to be.” He also acknowledged the criticism that he has thrown their way, noting that he is not a fan. But he emphasized that even if the Fed has made mistakes, responding in this sort of manner is not the right approach. Lower interest rates have often led to increased liquidity, which has historically seen prices of risky assets like Bitcoin and other digital assets shoot up. The recent statement coming after Powell said stabilizing a stablecoins legal framework is a good idea. “The climate is changing, and you’re moving into more mainstreaming of that whole sector, so Congress is again looking at a legal framework for stablecoins.” Senator Elizabeth Warren has also jumped to the defense of Powell, noting that if Trump fires him, it could undermine investor confidence in the integrity of capital markets. She also added that a move like this could trigger a big financial crash. During an appearance on CNBC, Senator Warren mentioned that the president lacked the legal authority to fire Powell, noting that if such a move happened, it could weaken the financial infrastructure of the United States. “If Chairman Powell can be fired by the President of the United States, it will crash the markets. The infrastructure that keeps this stock market strong and, therefore, a big part of our economy strong, and a big part of the world economy strong, is the idea that the big pieces move independently of politics,” she said. “If interest rates in the United States are subject to a president who just wants to wave his magic wand, this doesn’t distinguish us from any other two-bit dictatorship.” Trump criticizes Powell Trump had long criticized Powell, calling for his termination repeatedly because of his hesitation toward lowering interest rates. In his latest criticism, it looked as if Trump was ready to follow through on his threats and find a way to remove the chairman. Senator Rick Scott backed Trump’s call to remove Powell, noting that “It’s time to clean house of everyone working at the Federal Reserve who isn’t on board with helping the American people and fighting for their best interests.” The Trump administration has repeatedly mentioned that lowering interest rates is a top priority. In a previous post, Pompliano mentioned that Trump deliberately crashed the financial markets to force Powell to lower interest rates. “The President and his team are intentionally crashing the market. Is this a master plan or are we watching uncontrolled destruction?!,” he said on X. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Will PI & OM Prices Recover? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto markets have gained some momentum since the start of the week, which has attracted significant buying pressure onto the platform. Bitcoin sticks around $85,000, while Ethereum is trading close to $1600. Meanwhile, the other altcoins are also gaining some strength, but the prices of PI & OM continue to remain restricted within a range. Does this suggest the investors have not yet regained the lost confidence in the token? Will the prices remain consolidated within a narrow range? Pi Network (PI) Price Analysis The bulls have jumped yet again into action as the price has been working hard to trigger a strong rebound from the local support. The token has held finely above the support at $0.525, indicating the bulls are extremely vigilant. The PI price is trying hard to rise along the support of a bullish pattern, hinting towards a continued upswing, which may end up as a massive breakout soon. As seen in the above chart, the Pi Network price is trading within an ascending triangle and has been withstanding bearish pressure. The token is expected to rise along the support as RSI is incremental. Moreover, the DMI is close to settling a bullish crossover, which may trigger a fine upswing. Besides, the ADX is about to reach the lower threshold, which may trigger a strong rebound, suggesting a rise in the bullish strength. Therefore, the PI price is expected to maintain a healthy ascending trend and enter the resistance zone between $0.755 and $0.77. However, a huge influx of liquidity may lead to a breakout above $1. Mantra (OM) Price Analysis The Mantra platform faced one of the massive pullbacks in its history after the reports of the team transferring massive amounts of tokens raised huge suspicion. The token faced a massive sell-off, which dragged the OM price down by more than 90% in just a couple of hours. Despite the bullish attempt to revive a strong upswing, the bears managed to keep the levels above the support that has been held since March 2024. This hints towards a potential breakout to be on the horizon. The OM price has squashed all the gains of the 12 months by printing a massive weekly bearish candle. Despite the bullish attempt to set up a rebound, the bears managed to keep the rally restricted within a bearish trend. As a result, the price is believed to remain accumulated within a descending trend. The RSI is about to reach the lower threshold, while the MACD shows the rise of a huge selling pressure. Therefore, the OM price is expected to lose more of its value in the coming days as the market participants do not appear to be confident of the upcoming price action.",Uncategorized|Altcoins|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|OM,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-19 11:40:24

In a new thread, crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 783,300 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin will likely break out once US President Donald Trump’s tariff policies and the Fed’s rate cut plans are clearer. “Bitcoin is still stuck in a range, which it has been acting in for basically two months. The longer something stays within a narrow range, the heavier the impulse will be once it breaks out of it. I assume that we’ll see light at the end of the tunnel with the FED/tariffs and that Bitcoin will fast rally towards new all-time highs in this quarter.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X The analyst also predicts that Bitcoin will outperform gold over the next year. “Quite frankly, if you’d ask me to choose between BTC or gold for the next 12 months, I’d almost always take Bitcoin as I assume that will be, percent-wise, substantially higher than gold. If you put it wider, if I had another $1,000 available, I’d rather want to put it in ETH.” The analyst says that Bitcoin’s bull run will likely catch many off guard as worries about a recession mount. “It’s the final shakeout where a big majority believes we’re in a recession and early-peak top for Bitcoin. And then the big run comes.” Bitcoin is trading for $84,576 at time of writing, flat on the day.

However, an XRP Golden Cross on the daily chart signals a potential XRP price breakout . With increasing institutional interest in Asia, XRP price prediction suggests it could soon return to $3. 2024 proved to be a strong year for the XRP price , with a remarkable 235.7% increase. The market surged by 240.1% in Q4 alone, largely influenced by the shift in the US political landscape following Donald Trump’s win . However, in 2025, XRP price faced a 29.3% drop in February and a 2.52% dip in March. Despite these setbacks, January 2025 saw a 46% rise, with XRP price touching a peak of $3.4028. XRP Golden Cross: XRP Price Breakout Ahead? XRP Golden Cross The XRP Golden Cross formation on the daily chart is attracting significant attention. A Golden Cross occurs when a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average, indicating bullish potential. While moving averages can sometimes give false signals, this pattern suggests that XRP price prediction could be gearing up for a breakout. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price Consolidation Nears End, $5 Finally in Sight , Currently priced at $2.09, XRP price faces resistance at $2.60. If the XRP Golden Cross holds, it could push XRP above this resistance level, potentially moving towards the $3 range. This aligns with XRP price prediction for a bullish breakout. XRP price is currently at a crucial point. The $2.60 resistance level is key. If this is breached, a breakout towards $3 could be in play, confirming the XRP price prediction for upward movement. Watch for the continued influence of the Golden Cross and institutional support as driving factors. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

After weeks of consolidation, bulls have regained momentum, defending a key trendline and positioning SOL for a potential breakout as May approaches. The catalyst? Institutional conviction. Galaxy Digital recently acquired 606,000 SOL worth $83 million in just four days, staking 462,000 tokens—an unmistakable signal of long-term confidence in Solana’s scalability and ecosystem maturity.

A clean breakout here would mark a multi-week reversal and could open the door to $180 and $200—key zones from January’s rally.

A pullback and bounce from this level could offer a high-probability long entry. The bullish structure remains intact as long as the price stays above the trendline and 50 EMA. Trade Strategy: Entry: Pullback and bounce from $136 Target: $145.46 short-term, $152.96 extended Stop Loss: Below $129.80 for downside protection With institutional inflows growing and momentum building, May could be the month Solana clears $150 decisively—if bulls hold the line.

Earn Bitcoin with 86% APY Through Staking Beyond the airdrop rewards, BTC Bull’s staking program remains a major draw.

In a video posted to X on April 18, Pompliano said such an action could set a dangerous precedent, especially if driven by personal disagreement over monetary policy. “I do not believe that the President of the United States should come in and unilaterally fire the Fed President,” he stated firmly. The remark follows Trump’s Truth Social post in which he slammed Powell for being “too slow” in cutting interest rates and exclaimed, “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” Pompliano, though often critical of the Fed himself, urged caution. “Just because somebody else is doing something wrong doesn’t mean that you should do something wrong,” he added, highlighting that while the Federal Reserve’s political neutrality is debatable, removing its head for policy misalignment could destabilize institutional trust. Slippery Slopes and Shaky Markets Pompliano emphasized that firing someone over a policy disagreement—especially in a role designed to function independently—sends the wrong signal. “The idea of firing the Fed chairman is a very bad precedent to set this way,” he said. His concerns are echoed by U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, who warned that such a move could erode investor confidence and potentially trigger market panic. “A big part of our economy being strong—and a big part of the world economy being strong—is the idea that the big pieces move independently of politics,” she said during a CNBC appearance. Such political meddling, analysts fear, could rattle traditional investors and also reverberate through the crypto markets. Historically, lower interest rates have buoyed risk-on assets like Bitcoin, which thrives in high-liquidity environments. But if trust in financial governance crumbles, even crypto could suffer whiplash . Crypto Still Watching the Fed—But for Different Reasons Interestingly, Powell recently acknowledged that the regulations for stablecoins may soon change . Speaking at an Economic Club of Chicago panel on April 16, he noted the “mainstreaming” of digital assets and the need for a legislative framework to match. While Trump and Powell may be clashing over monetary pace, the crypto world remains focused on how the Fed will influence the industry’s future—not just with rates, but with regulation. In the end, Pompliano’s message is clear: political overreach may win short-term points, but it could cost everyone in the long run.

In 2027, it will range between $0.71 and $0.86, with an average price of $0.73. In 2030, it will range between $2.02 and $2.48, with an average price of $2.08. The parallel stack, a robust, open-source framework designed for crafting rollups and layer 2s that harness parallel processing, is now on SEI V2. The stack enhances Ethereum ’s performance by targeting most bottlenecks that Layer 2 blockchains face. Such developments are anticipated to drive SEI value over the long term. Regarding price performance, SEI shows signs of trading higher; however, it remains affected by the general market sentiment. How high will SEI go? Is SEI a good investment? What will SEI’s value be in 2025? Will SEI rise? Read on and discover the SEI price prediction from 2025 to 2031.

SEI’s Total Value Locked (TVL ), assets locked in the blockchain, has stagnated at the $365M mark. TVL points to more capital flowing into decentralized platforms, affecting their usability and popularity. SEI/USD 1-day chart price analysis SEI/USD 1-day chart SEI broke out downwards in December 2024, a trend that has continued to this day as it trades below the $0.18 mark. The MACD indicator shows waning positive market momentum, and the William Alligator trendlines show waning volatility.

SEI price analysis shows the market was bearish for the better part of the month, however, it shows signs of moving into consolidation in the shorter timeframes. Why is SEI down? SEI was bearish over the last weeks as it fell into annual lows. The drop continues despite a rising TVL, indicating rising interest in its DeFi market. Will SEI reach $1? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, SEI will rise above $1 in 2028, when the coin will reach a high of $1.21. Can Sei Coin reach $10? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, SEI is unlikely to reach $10 before 2031. Will SEI reach $100? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, SEI is unlikely to reach $100 before 2031. Does SEI have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, SEI will trade higher in years to come. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory Is SEI a good investment? SEI has growing utility, and its EVM compatibility helps it steal a share of Ethereum’s dominance. While the technical analysis is bearish, price predictions paint a different picture. Recent news SEI has introduced the Sei Development Foundation, a U.S. nonprofit organization headquartered in Manhattan, to provide the infrastructure required for institutional adoption and for builders to accelerate crypto’s future globally.

The BIS report notes that while the crypto market remains largely isolated from traditional financial institutions (TradFi), recent developments such as the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs and the rise of real-world asset (RWA) tokenization have deepened the connection between the two sectors. The report notes that these evolving connections require greater attention and stricter oversight. Perhaps most striking is the BIS’s analysis of how financial shocks in crypto markets can increase wealth inequality. A chart in the report shows that during periods of market stress, small individual investors tend to increase their crypto exposure, while wealthier investors exit the market. The result, according to the BIS, is a “redistribution of wealth from poorer to richer.” Related News: Pi Coin (PI) Developers Release Update on Token Distribution, Mainnet Migration and Future of the Network This observation echoes concerns raised by other regulators, with Ulrich Bindseil of the European Central Bank (ECB) previously arguing that Bitcoin’s structure disproportionately benefits early adopters, who are often wealthy, at the expense of latecomers. The BIS report outlines two key developments that have accelerated the convergence of DeFi and traditional finance. The first is the decision by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. This move has significantly facilitated exposure to crypto for institutional and individual investors through traditional financial channels. Second is the continued expansion of tokenized real-world assets. While DeFi primarily revolves around crypto-native assets, the tokenization of assets like bonds, stocks, and real estate is poised to bring mainstream financial instruments to blockchain platforms. This could lead to decentralized exchanges (DEXs) becoming more widely used by TradFi institutions. The BIS advocates a “containment” approach to mitigate potential risks. This includes aligning DeFi protocols with regulatory frameworks currently applied to TradFi organizations. The report recommends implementing Know Your Customer (KYC) rules, enhanced disclosure requirements, and creating legal responsibilities for those operating decentralized protocols. *This is not investment advice.

Qubetics Now Leads the Top Altcoins for Massive Return Potential,https://timestabloid.com/sei-didnt-deliver-what-you-hoped-qubetics-now-leads-the-top/,"Ever had that sinking feeling after betting on a project that didn’t quite live up to its hype? SEI promised high-speed execution and new infrastructure design, but for many community members, it ended up being more hype than substance. If you’re one of those who thought SEI would be your breakout moment but were left underwhelmed, you’re not alone. It’s frustrating watching early momentum fizzle out while the returns you hoped for remain out of reach. Especially in crypto, where missed timing can mean watching others walk away with 10x gains while you’re still holding the bag. But here’s the good news: there’s a shot at redemption—and it’s called Qubetics . While you were giving SEI the benefit of the doubt, Qubetics was quietly stacking achievements and preparing for something much bigger. This Web3 aggregated chain has all the markers of a high-utility chain, and the Qubetics presale is one of the hottest opportunities circulating right now. With limited stages left and a ticking seven-day countdown per stage, the urgency to get in is real. If you’ve been burned before, this might be your shot to flip that narrative—because Qubetics is now leading the race among the top altcoins to buy. Missed Qubetics at $0.01? Here’s Why It Still Tops the List of Top Altcoins to Buy Qubetics early supporters who joined its whitelist had the chance to secure $TICS at just $0.01 with zero upfront investment. That was September 29, 2024. Since then, over 29 stages have flown by—each with a 10% increase, every 7 days. If you missed out back then, that’s on the record. But right now, at Stage 30, it’s still affordable. The Qubetics presale is priced at $0.1729, and with over 508 million $TICS already sold and more than 24,900 token holders, the momentum speaks volumes. Over $16.2 million has been raised, showing just how rapidly this opportunity is gaining traction. And it’s not just hype—this is rooted in numbers and projections. Let’s break it down. If you put in just $1,000 today at $0.1729, and $TICS hits $1 post-presale, that’s a return of $5,778. At $5? You’re looking at $28,900. But the real kicker is if $TICS touches $15 after the mainnet launch in Q2 2025—you’re staring at a staggering 8,567.92% ROI, totaling $86,580 from a mere grand. It’s not a promise—it’s a possibility. And it’s the kind of scenario that makes Qubetics stand tall among the top altcoins to buy this year. Now, beyond price potential, Qubetics is solving one of the biggest headaches in blockchain—interoperability. In today’s fragmented Web3 space, each chain works in isolation, creating silos. Qubetics brings Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana, and more into one unified experience. For businesses, this means real-time multi-chain transactions without needing third-party bridges. Think of a gaming studio connecting assets between Avalanche and Ethereum, or a logistics firm syncing data between Polygon and Solana without friction. For individuals, it’s seamless NFT movement or DeFi farming without leaving the platform. In short, it’s freedom from fragmentation—something that has real value in everyday crypto operations. This tech flexibility makes Qubetics adaptable to countless sectors. Whether you’re a DeFi builder, data analyst, fintech firm, or NFT artist, Qubetics brings one chain to rule them all. That’s why this project isn’t just a flash in the pan—it’s designed for the long run, and it’s making serious waves across the community. It’s no wonder Qubetics is being dubbed one of the top altcoins to buy right now. SEI’s Stumble—What Really Went Wrong? SEI came in strong with its promise of a high-performance layer-1 optimized for trading. Its architecture was built to support DeFi use cases with custom parallelization and a twin-turbo consensus model. Community members who got in early during its ICO phase saw an opening price of $0.26—and for a while, things looked promising. The initial pump gave early buyers some hope, but it didn’t take long for momentum to dry up. Its all-time high touched $0.86, and that felt like the peak. Since then, it’s been mostly sideways or down, leaving many with little to show for their early belief in the project. The disappointment with SEI isn’t just about price stagnation—it’s the lack of meaningful network traction that’s raised questions. Despite strong branding and a slick tech pitch, real-world application and adoption haven’t followed at the scale many expected. Developers haven’t flocked to the ecosystem the way SEI hoped, and it still lags behind in daily volume and user activity when compared to other L1s. It’s a classic case of promising infrastructure but failing to build a thriving, sticky community around it. And in crypto, hype can only take you so far before results matter. Right now, SEI still sits on exchanges, but it’s no longer leading the conversation about top altcoins to buy. Still Want Massive Returns? This Is the Time to Join This Crypto Presale You’ve seen how early-stage entries can change the game—Cardano, Solana, Avalanche, all had their moment. SEI might have missed the mark, but Qubetics is making sure its time in the spotlight counts. The ongoing Qubetics presale still offers entry points that could translate to life-changing ROI, especially before the mainnet goes live in Q2 2025. The technology is ready, the mission is clear, and community support is already massive. This isn’t a “what if”—this is a “what now.” For anyone still looking for top altcoins to buy, it’s rare to get in when the fire’s already catching but the price is still low. Qubetics gives you that window, backed by real infrastructure goals, real data, and real demand. If you missed SEI, don’t repeat the same mistake. Now’s the time to join this crypto presale and position yourself early in what could be the biggest altcoin success story of 2025. Don’t sit this one out.

We’ll also suggest some of the best altcoins you can buy to benefit from a potential $BTC rally. Is $BTC Bearish Now? It’s still too early to say that BTC has gone into bearish territory. Although the recent dips replicate its previous bearish run patterns, the dips aren’t as sharp. Plus, these drawdowns are mostly attributed to macroeconomic factors, including, of course, Trump’s tariffs. The fundamentals of the coin itself have little to do with these dips. A large part of the unrealized short-term losses are also because of the recent dips. A good thing, though, is that STHs aren’t selling $BTC as of now. Their willingness to sit on some losses shows that the market participants still believe in a positive long-term proposition. If you look at Bitcoin’s weekly chart, you’ll notice a sharp bounce from the 50 EMA, which also happens to be a critical support zone for the token. What’s more, the bounce is also occurring from the 50% Fibonacci level, showing continued strength. Another bit of positive news is that even after the recent turbulence, long-term holders are still sitting on unrealized profits and seem to be willing to absorb a bit of loss as well. All in all, Bitcoin seems to be well-positioned for a good rally that could see the king cryptocurrency reclaim its recent highs. If you’re looking to make the most of the upcoming run, here are some of the best cryptos to buy now . 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Altcoin to Buy and HODL in 2025 Bitcoin’s long-term bullish bias is very much intact thanks to unfazed institutional interest and increasing support from governments worldwide. If you want to make the most amount of gains from the next Bitcoin bull rally, a cheap crypto like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) that’s built to follow Bitcoin’s coattails could be the answer. $BTCBULL is likely to closely follow Bitcoin’s upward trajectory because it will give free (and real) $BTC to its token holders. This will happen every time Bitcoin crosses a new landmark, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K. Additionally, the BTC Bull Token developers have also planned to follow a steady deflationary approach. Essentially, they will reduce the total token supply at regular intervals to maintain $BTCBULL’s demand and price. The good news keeps coming, as the project’s tokenomics suggest that 40% of the total supply will be used for PR and marketing. Again, this will bolster $BTCBULL’s hype in the market. BTC Bull Token is currently in presale, which has gone from strength to strength to collect over $4.8M so far. One token is available for just $0.00247, and here’s how to buy $BTCBULL . 2. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – Top New AI Altcoin Offering Crypto Investment Advice Given the number of cryptos that have flooded the market in the last few months, finding profitable opportunities has become increasingly difficult. Enter MIND of Pepe ($MIND) . $MIND is not just the best AI agent coin , but it’s also, quite frankly, a genius. After it has studied the ongoing trends and chatter around crypto on online platforms like X, $MIND will use its revolutionary hive-mind intelligence to find out the best cryptos to invest in . In addition to such expert insights into crypto investing, $MIND token holders will also get exclusive access to the tokens created by MIND of Pepe firsthand. Naturally, these tokens will be built out of viral ideas, meaning they’ll be in a pole position to join the list of the top trending cryptos . The best part? MIND of Pepe is currently in presale ($8M+ raised), which is why each token is available for a low price of $0.0037215. For more info, check out our guide on how to buy $MIND . 3. Comedian ($BAN) – Pure Meme Coin Dominating the Market Right Now Comedian ($BAN) is unlike the two cryptos mentioned above, seeing as it has no real utility. In other words, it’s a pure meme coin that only thrives on market hype and community interest. However, because of how intense meme coin rallies can be, the ROI potential of tokens like $BAN is multiple times greater than almost every single conventional investment. $BAN, for instance, has gained more than 71,000% since its launch in October 2024. After a nearly month-long consolidation, the token has surged past its recent resistance level. $BAN is up over 17% in the last seven days and is currently trading at $0.04527. Comedian, by the way, is inspired by the controversial artwork of Maurizio Cattelan, which simply features a yellow banana taped to a wall. This modern artwork is controversial because it’s allegedly a disrespect to contemporary art, which features more sophisticated themes and intricate designs. Meme coins, however, thrive on such virality, which is exactly why $BAN has been so successful. Conclusion Although Bitcoin’s bullish outlook is undoubtedly great for your crypto portfolio, it’s important to remember that the market can change tides overnight. We suggest accounting for the current market volatility and uncertainty and only investing an amount you’re happy sidelining.

Mow says many people fall into a psychological trap known as unit bias — the belief that lower-priced coins like XRP or Solana are better deals than Bitcoin, simply because they cost less per token. But according to him, that thinking is misleading and potentially costly. Why 1 Bitcoin Is So Precious Bitcoin has a hard supply cap of just 21 million coins — and that number will never increase. This limited supply is a key reason behind Bitcoin’s value. So when someone buys 1 BTC, even at around $85,000, they’re purchasing 1 out of only 21 million units that will ever exist. Mow emphasizes that it’s this scarcity that gives Bitcoin its strong value proposition. You can buy one twenty-one millionth of the BTC supply for ~$85,000. What happens if you remove unit bias from alts to calculate the equiv 1/21 million? ETH: $9,200 XRP: $5,800 SOL: $3,400 No way these alts are worth that much. #Bitcoin dominance is going so much higher. — Samson Mow (@Excellion) April 19, 2025 Applying Bitcoin Logic to Other Coins To highlight how misleading unit prices can be, Mow did a quick comparison. He took the market capitalizations of Ethereum, XRP, and Solana, and divided them by 21 million — the same number as Bitcoin’s total supply. Here’s what he found: Ethereum: $193 billion market cap ÷ 21 million = $9,200 XRP: $121 billion ÷ 21 million = $5,800 Solana: $71 billion ÷ 21 million = $3,400 This method shows that, on a per-unit basis, owning one “Bitcoin-equivalent” share of ETH, XRP, or SOL would actually cost much more than people assume. The Illusion of Cheap Coins Mow explains that unit bias tricks investors into thinking a coin is affordable just because it has a low price tag. For example, someone might say, “XRP is only $2, while Bitcoin is $85,000 — that’s too expensive.” But what they often miss is that coins like XRP have huge circulating supplies. XRP, for example, has around 58.3 billion tokens in circulation. That large supply pushes down the per-token price, but doesn’t make it a better value. Mow believes this misunderstanding is common among new investors, and it’s part of what draws them into altcoins. Bitcoin Is Still King Once investors understand how unit bias works, Mow expects many will rethink their strategies and return to Bitcoin. In his view, Bitcoin’s limited supply and strong fundamentals continue to make it the best long-term investment in the crypto space. His message is clear: “Bitcoin only.” Mow is no stranger to making big calls. He previously predicted that Bitcoin would hit $ 1 million by 2021 — a timeline that didn’t materialize, but a target he still stands behind in the long run. As the market matures and more people grasp the real economics behind crypto valuations, Mow believes Bitcoin’s dominance will only grow. For investors willing to look beyond the price tag, the numbers tell a very different story.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|SOL|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-19 12:49:49

The hourly price chart confirms that dYdX is attempting a dip below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing an upside recovery rally in the coming hours. If dYdX’s price holds momentum above $0.6064, it will fuel a bullish rally to $0.6725. dydX price chart If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the dYdX price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.4944, beginning a bearish trend to $0.4351. Is dYdX a good investment? The rising institutional demand for dYdX makes it a good investment option. However, dYdX has a short investment history filled with very volatile phases. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Why is dYdX up today? Following the overall buying demand in the market, dYdX witnessed a surge in buying pressure. As a result, buyers are aiming for a hold above $0.6. Will dYdX Recover? If buyers hold above $0.6 level strongly, we might see a strong recovery in the coming hours. What is the dYdX price prediction for 2025? In 2025, dYdX is predicted to reach a minimum level of $3.86. Traders and investors can expect a maximum level of $4.55 and an average price of $3.96 if the bulls show up. Will dYdX reach $10? Depending on market sentiment, dYdX might hit the $10 mark by the end of 2027. However, any bearish news might weaken this prediction. Will the dYdX price reach $100? $100 will be a significant milestone for dYdX. However, it is achievable if dYdX continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is dYdX a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate dYdX and it faces a rise in global recognition, dYdX has a solid long-term future.

However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation around $0.5. dYdX price prediction Minimum price Average price Maximum price dYdX price prediction April 2025 $0.5 $0.9 $1.2 dYdX price prediction 2025 The price of 1 dYdX is expected to reach a minimum level of $0.4 by the end of 2025.

Traders can expect an average price of $6.11 throughout 2026. If the market stays positive, we expect the dYdX price to trade well above $5 by 2027. However, the future market potential for dYdX entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment in long-term holding. dYdX historical price sentiment dydx price history dYdX price started trading in December 2023, hovering below $3.5. In January 2024, the price of dYdX faced a decline as it recorded a low of $2.4. However, in March, the dYdX surged exponentially and touched a high near $4.3. After that, dYdX initiated its bearish rally and hovered around $1 till November. However, dYdX soon recovered following Trump’s victory in the elections, skyrocketing toward $2.6 in December of 2024.

Regardless, if the markets start pricing in lower future interest rates, it typically weakens the dollar and boosts demand for alternative assets like Bitcoin ( BTC ). So far, Powell has resisted raising interest rates. At last check Saturday, Bitcoin was trading at $85,232.30. Its price has remained between the support and resistance points at $84,000 and $85,000, up by about 14% above the lowest point this month. See below. Source: CoinGecko Under the U.S. Federal Reserve Act, the president can’t fire the chair. The Fed is designed to be independent of political influence so it can make decisions in the best interest of the economy, even if they’re unpopular with the White House. But Trump’s White House has normalized challenging virtually all political precedents, such as defying court orders on immigration and punishing news organizations that it doesn’t like. And now, according to Kevin Hassett, the National Economic Council director, Trump is studying whether he has the authority to replace Powell. His statement came after Trump told the press : “I’m not happy with him. I let him know it. And oh, if I want him out, he’ll be out of there real fast, believe me. If we had a Fed chairman who understood what he was doing, interest rates would be coming down.” Trump’s statement followed Powell’s insistence that the Fed was not in a hurry to cut interest rates. Instead, the bank is focusing on Trump’s tariffs and whether they will lead to higher inflation. Mary Daly, another Fed official, stated that rate cuts would need to be delayed if inflation persisted at high levels. You might also like: Morgan Stanley exec says Trump’s threats to Fed chief Powell is ‘noise’ Experts believe that Trump can only fire Powell for cause, which is often interpreted to mean misconduct. Should Trump remove him without cause, it could attract major legal challenges. CNN reported that Trump is considering former Fed governor and crypto startup investor Kevin Warsh to be Fed chair once Powell’s time ends. What does it mean for Bitcoin? Cryptocurrency bulls see firing the Fed chair as an erosion of confidence in the central bank. The theory is that such a move would drive the U.S. dollar lower and Bitcoin higher in the long term. Historically, currencies of central banks that lack independence often underperform. Examples of these are the Turkish lira and the Zimbabwe dollar. The 4H chart below shows that Bitcoin has been in a tight range in the past few weeks. Notice how it has moved slightly above the 50-period moving average. BTC price chart | Source: crypto.news Most importantly, the coin has formed a bullish pennant. This widely recognized bullish pattern consists of a vertical line and a symmetrical triangle. It often leads to a strong bullish breakout when the triangles are nearing their confluence. Therefore, Bitcoin is expected to have a strong bullish breakout, with the next point to watch being at $88,585, its highest level in April.

This move has been made in partnership with HashKey Capital, which launched this fund in order to expand institutional access to the altcoin. Ripple Invests In HashKey’s XRP Product In an X post, Hashkey Capital announced that it is launching Asia’s first XRP Tracker Fund with Ripple as an early investor. The asset manager noted that this move represents a significant step in expanding institutional access to XRP. Related Reading: Cardano Price Surge To $1.7: Here Are The Factors To Drive The Recovery The firm further stated that it chose XRP because the altcoin is at the forefront of cross-border payments, thanks to Ripple’s payment services, and enables faster, cheaper, and more efficient transactions than traditional systems, such as SWIFT. XRP is also enabling the tokenization of Real World Assets (RWAs) on its native blockchain, the XRP Ledger (XRPL). HashKey added that financial institutions and enterprises worldwide are already using XRP. The asset manager also noted that the XRP Tracker Fund is its third tracker fund, following its Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The firm also raised the possibility of converting the fund into an ETF within the next one to two years, subject to regulatory approval. This move will further broaden institutional access. Beyond the XRP Tracker Fund, HashKey Capital and Ripple are also partnering to explore new investment products, cross-border DeFi solutions, and tokenization. This includes the potential launch of a money market fund (MMF) on the XRPL. Meanwhile, for the tracker fund, Ripple will seed the initial investment. Hashkey stated that with Ripple as an anchor investor, this fund marks a “deepening collaboration” between two leaders in the blockchain space. The asset manager reaffirmed that the goal is to bring more institutional capital into regulated XRP products and the broader digital asset ecosystem. Ripple continues to make moves to boost XRP’s adoption. The crypto firm recently agreed to acquire prime broker Hidden Road for $1.25 billion, one of the largest deals in crypto history. Through this acquisition, the crypto firm aims to boost XRP and the RLUSD’s utility as it looks to make its mark in both the traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) space. XRP Could Allegedly Play A Major Role in The Federal Reserve’s Plans In an X post, crypto commentator CryptoGeek alleged that the Federal Reserve has officially hinted that they may use XRP to power the blockchain component of their FedNow payment system. CryptoGeek added that this has come following multiple rumored meetings with Ripple. However, the Fed has yet to make any official statement on this development. Related Reading: Bitcoin Enters Oversold Levels, Analyst Warns This Is Bearish, Not Bullish Ripple will undoubtedly continue to make progress with getting financial institutions, especially US banks, to adopt its payment service, which XRP facilitates. The crypto firm is nearly in the clear with its lawsuit against the US SEC, as the court recently granted a joint motion to pause the appeal case while they finalize their settlement. As such, with the long-running legal battle almost out of the way, these institutions will be more inclined to partner with Ripple.

While she still expects Bitcoin to post gains by year-end, Alden noted that the tariffs introduced in February have tempered her earlier bullish outlook. Lyn Alden Says Liquidity Surge Could Propel Bitcoin to Higher Targets Alden explained that a major liquidity boost could push Bitcoin toward more ambitious targets. Such a scenario might occur if the U.S. bond market faces a crisis, prompting the Federal Reserve to respond with quantitative easing or yield curve control. Despite current macro headwinds, Alden believes there is still a “good chance” Bitcoin surpasses the $100,000 mark in 2025. However, she warned that global market volatility remains a key obstacle, especially because Bitcoin trades continuously — unlike traditional equity markets with limited trading hours. “Because it trades 24/7, if people are worried about how things are going to open on Monday, some pools of capital can sell their Bitcoin on a Sunday and prepare,” she said, pointing out that Bitcoin often reacts first to market jitters due to its round-the-clock nature. While its correlation to tech-heavy indices like the Nasdaq 100 has been noted, Alden believes Bitcoin can sometimes diverge, particularly when broader market conditions weigh on U.S. equities without directly impacting global liquidity. She drew comparisons to the period between 2003 and 2007, when a weak U.S. dollar cycle fueled capital flows into commodities, emerging markets, and gold — bypassing U.S. stocks. A similar environment could prove favorable for Bitcoin, Alden suggested. “If we encounter a five-year period like that again, that could be a period where Bitcoin does pretty well, even as the U.S. stock market doesn’t do particularly well,” she added. This brand new interview with @LynAldenContact can be described as nothing short of a masterclass on the U.S. dollar's global reserve currency status: the tradeoffs, trade deficits, and USD hegemony's impact on the working class.

Bitcoin Could Face Extended Consolidation Despite Bullish Hype: 10x Research As reported, 10x Research’s head of research Markus Thielen has argued that Bitcoin may be entering a period of extended consolidation . In a recent market note, Thielen warned that short-term technical signals are painting a more cautious picture, even as many analysts forecast new all-time highs by mid-year. Thielen pointed to the Bitcoin stochastic oscillator, a technical indicator that measures momentum, suggesting the market is displaying traits more consistent with a late-cycle top than the beginning of a new bull run. While Thielen urges caution, other analysts maintain a more bullish stance. Economists Timothy Peterson and Jamie Coutts, Real Vision’s chief crypto analyst, expect Bitcoin to hit new highs in Q2.

In one of his latest analyses on April 18, network economist Timothy Peterson calculated that BTC/USD may rise as high as $138,000 within the next three months. BTC price probabilities give bulls the upper hand Bitcoin is navigating highly unusual macroeconomic conditions as a result of the ongoing US trade war , but history still offers clues as to where BTC price action may head next. For Peterson, the US High Yield Index Effective Yield, currently at over 8%, holds the key. “This has happened 38 times since 2010 (monthly data),” he summarized. “3 months later: Bitcoin was up 71% of the time. The median gain was +31%. If it went lower, the worst loss was -16%.” US High Yield Index Effective Yield.

Bitcoin would need to deliver 62% gains within that period to achieve that maximum level. As Cointelegraph reported , Peterson has been a frequent contributor to BTC price forecasts in 2025, with one of his proprietary tools, Lowest Price Forward, giving 95% odds of a $69,000 floor in March.

The statement was made during an appearance at the CfC St. Moritz, a highly regarded and selective blockchain and digital assets conference. The information was shared by crypto investor Xaif, who shared a worthy note alongside the clip of Garlinghouse speaking at the event. “Brad Garlinghouse: Ripple doesn’t need to raise capital. There’s no IPO in 2025 — we haven’t needed outside funding. #XRP. Strong signal: Ripple is self-sustaining and focused on building, not begging,” Xaif said on X. The post reflects the growing acceptance of Ripple as a financial entity within the crypto industry, separate from the need for raising capital using public markets. Brad Garlinghouse dismisses IPO talks In the video shared on X by Xaif, the Ripple boss addressed the hot topic about the company’s chances of a potential IPO. He mentioned that companies typically try to go public to raise capital, but it has never been something that has been a necessity for Ripple. “In reality, most companies that go public do that to raise capital. We haven’t needed to raise capital. And so that has not been a driving force,” Garlinghouse said. The Ripple boss also talked about the internal discussions of the company going public. Garlinghouse mentioned that the idea has turned up a few times, but the hostile regulatory conditions in the United States have made the company push back on such a decision. “We have talked a little bit about, would we go public? And, you know, it’s like, well, the US market until recently has been very hostile. And like, why would we even try to have that conversation?” he added. Ripple has been the recipient of some sort of hostility from regulators over the last few years, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) initiating a lawsuit against the company back in 2020 for selling unregistered securities. The hard-fought legal battle lasted about five years, with both parties agreeing to settle things amicably some weeks ago. Both parties are expected to complete formal steps for the settlement, with Ripple expected to pay $50 million, one which it has teased that it could pay in XRP. Ripple CEO calm over the timeline During the event, Garlinghouse answered a definitive no when asked if the public could expect an IPO soon. He added that while 2025 has arrived, pursuing a public offering is not currently part of the company’s strategy. He added that the company is still looking at how going public could be beneficial. “You have to ask yourself, okay, how does Ripple benefit from being a public company? And, you know, therefore, is it a high priority for us?” he said. However, Garlinghouse mentioned that the door remains open to reassess this position if the regulatory environment in the United States changes in the future. “As conditions change, you never say never and you re-evaluate,” Garlinghouse added. He also signaled that Ripple’s strategy could evolve depending on how the SEC and broader policy developments unfold. This means that Ripple has enough capital, and carries out its activities strategically, but is not driven by the need to go public to seek capital.

Notably, this prison once housed several high-profile inmates, including cult leader Charles Manson, notorious crime boss Al Capone, and former Theranos COO Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani, who was convicted of fraud. Bankman-Fried Moved from Victorville to Terminal Island Before landing at the terminal Island in Los Angeles, Fried was held at FCI Victorville , a medium-security prison in San Bernardino County which is known for its tough conditions and political atmosphere. Just a month earlier, he was briefly held at the Federal Transfer Facility in Oklahoma City during his relocation process. The prison shuffle comes shortly after Fried made headlines for giving an unauthorised Jailhouse interview to media figure Tucker Carlson , His high-profile case has him under the public eye for his role in the FTX collapse.

At his sentencing in March 2024, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan remarked that Fried knew his actions were wrong and criminal, but he still took the risk believing that he would not get caught. He is now serving a 25-year sentence and has been ordered to pay $11 billion for his role in one of the biggest crypto frauds in history. After the dramatic collapse of FTX, Fried reportedly created a Google Doc outlining ways to rebuild his public image. One of the ideas included appearing on Tucker Carlson’s show (spelled “Tucker Carlsen” in his draft) and positioning himself as a Republican in opposition to the “woke agenda.” Bankman’s Efforts To Secure Pardon From Trump Legal experts now believe that Fried’s surprising shift towards right-wing messaging could be a part of his calculated effort to secure a pardon from President Trump. Since Trump’s inauguration, reports suggest that Bankman may be reaching out to right wing-figures in hopes of securing a Presidential pardon. This comes after Ross Ulbricht, the Silk Road founder, who received a pardon from Trump and is set to appear at the Bitcoin 2025 conference. Meanwhile other former FTX executives including Caroline Ellison and Ryan Salame are in prison with little public attention.

You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions. 'Regulation by prosecution' The narrative The U.S. Department of Justice ""will no longer pursue litigation or enforcement actions that have the effect of superimposing regulatory frameworks on digital assets"" in lieu of regulatory agencies putting together their own frameworks for overseeing the sector, a 4-page memo signed by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche on April 7 said. In other words, the DOJ will no longer pursue ""regulation by prosecution,"" the memo said. Why it matters The DOJ's memo raised concerns that it may mean criminal activities in the crypto sector would not be prosecuted, or at least prosecuted as heavily as it was under the past several years — both by disbanding the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET) and by shifting the entity's priorities. Breaking it down At a practical level, the memo itself is internal guidance but may not be a binding document. Multiple attorneys told CoinDesk they interpreted the guidance to indicate that the DOJ would still bring fraud or other criminal cases involving crypto, but would try to avoid any cases where the DOJ itself had to determine if a digital asset was a security or a commodity. ""Fraud is still fraud,"" said Josh Naftalis, a partner at Pallas Partners LLP and a former prosecutor with the U.S. Attorney's office for the Southern District of New York. ""This memo does not seem to say the DOJ is not going to prosecute fraud in the crypto space."" Still, the memo raised alarms for prominent Democrats who questioned whether the DOJ was suggesting it would let criminal conduct occur. Senators Elizabeth Warren, Mazie Hirono, Richard Durbin, Sheldon Whitehouse, Christopher Coons and Richard Blumenthal wrote a letter to Blanche, saying his ""decision to give a free pass to cryptocurrency money launderers"" and shut down the NCET were ""grave mistakes that will support sanctions evasion, drug trafficking, scams and child sexual exploitation."" ""Specifically, the Department will no longer target virtual currency exchanges, mixing and tumbling services and offline wallets for the acts of their end users or unwitting violations of regulations — except to the extent the investigation is consistent with the priorities articulated in the following paragraphs,"" the DOJ memo said, a passage the Senators' letter referenced. New York Attorney General Letitia James wrote an open letter to Senate leaders in the same week asking them to advance legislation to address cryptocurrency risks. She did not specifically reference Blanche's memo but detailed possible ways to better police the sector through legislation. Katherine Reilly, a partner at Pryor Cashman and a former prosecutor with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, told CoinDesk that most of the major crypto cases brought by the DOJ in recent years would not have been affected had this guidance been in effect. The BitMEX case in 2020, when the DOJ and Commodity Futures Trading Commission brought unregistered trading and other charges against the platform, is ""probably closest to the line"" of being a case that may not have been brought under this guidance, she said. Trump pardoned BitMEX , its founders and a senior employee in late March, barely two weeks before the DOJ memo was shared. ""I think that it's clear that the Justice Department wants to limit the DOJ's role in regulating the crypto industry … looking beyond its role in other crimes, fraud, laundering proceeds from narcotics trafficking, things like that, and sort of take a step back from the role of trying to bring order and fairness to the crypto industry as a whole,"" Reilly said. That's ""probably the intent behind the BitMEX pardons too,"" she said. Naftalis said the DOJ will continue to pursue drug, terrorism or other illicit financing charges even under the memo. ""I think that the headline for the industry is to the extent that there are legal uses of crypto, they're not going to set the guard rail by criminal enforcement,"" he said. ""That's for Congress."" One section of the memo tells prosecutors not to charge Bank Secrecy Act violations, unregistered securities offering violations, unregistered broker-dealer violations or other Commodity Exchange Act registration violations ""unless there is evidence that the defendant knew of the licensing or registration requirement at issue and violated such a requirement willfully."" Carla Reyes, an Associate Professor of Law at SMU Dedman School of Law, told CoinDesk that this may be referencing recent cases where developers build tools under the impression that they were not committing unlicensed money transmitting activities under existing guidance but may get charged anyway. ""Most criminal statutes require some level of knowledge to define your intention, and knowledge that you're committing a crime when you do it,"" she said. ""The further away you get from that, the lesser the charge, but the more willful [and] intentional it is, the higher the charge."" What the memo seems to want to explicitly move away from is any suggestion that federal prosecutors would interpret how securities or commodities laws might apply to digital assets. ""Prosecutors should not charge violations of the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Commodity Exchange Act, or the regulations promulgated pursuant to these Acts, in cases where (a) the charge would require the Justice Department to litigate whether a digital asset is a 'security' or 'commodity,' and (b) there is an adequate alternative criminal charge available, such as mail or wire fraud,"" the memo said. A popular critique leveled against former SEC Chair Gary Gensler by the crypto industry was that he was ""regulating by enforcement,"" rather than focusing on developing guidance for the industry to know what was or wasn't acceptable. Blanche seems to be referring to a similar critique in the memo, Naftalis said, in that one-off enforcement decisions by the SEC or DOJ should not define the guardrails for the industry. Steve Segal, a shareholder at Buchalter, said that some of the DOJ's past cases would charge trading venues for failing to police their own customers. The memo now seems to suggest that if a crypto exchange's executives were running a clean platform, and customers were laundering funds derived from criminal activities, the executives would not be charged. This is in contrast with, for example, FTX, where the executives were charged and convicted of (or pled guilty to) fraud charges. ""Of course, a lot of the big crypto cases we've seen over the last few years are sort of pure investor fraud, things like FTX. And one of the more interesting things about this memo is it talks about crypto investors and really prioritizing cases where crypto investors are being victimized,"" Reilly said. ""And so I don't think we should conclude that this memo means we're going to see a lot fewer cases in the crypto space, or that crypto companies can sort of breathe a sigh of relief that the DOJ is out of the picture for a few years."" The DOJ's future cases may appear a bit different in terms of the specific allegations made, but ""it's much too soon to say that everybody can assume the DOJ is out of the crypto business,"" she said. Many of the attorneys speaking to CoinDesk agreed that the memo itself did not clarify all of the different issues that may come up with a criminal case, nor was it an end-all/be-all document. The memo announced prosecutorial discretion but it isn't itself a law, Reyes said, adding that it may guide internal decision-making about which cases to pursue the most heavily, as well as the strategies that guide those prosecutions. A lot of details about how this memo ties together with Trump's executive order on the strategic bitcoin reserve still need to be spelled out, Segal said. Sections on victim compensation and how seized funds should be handled in the memo do not explain how the DOJ might handle situations where seized funds are turned over to bankruptcy estates, such as what happened with FTX or other similar scenarios. ""I think we'll really have to see how it plays out, because this guidance, I do think, leaves prosecutors a lot of room to bring cases even of these kinds of violations that are being cast as more regulatory,"" Reilly said. ""So even if that's the intent, I think the devil is in the details on what cases we see going forward.""

In a new CNBC interview, Hoskinson says that Bitcoin is not headed towards “another crypto winter” or a downturn. According to the Cardano creator, Bitcoin is primed to go up by approximately 196% from the current level over the coming months. “I think Bitcoin will be over $250,000 by the end of this year or next year.” Hoskinson says that Bitcoin’s rally will be driven by an improved regulatory environment, the easing of monetary policy and a fall in global trade tensions. “What will happen is that the tariff stuff will be a dud, and then people will realize that the world is willing to negotiate, and it’s really just US versus China. And a lot of people will side with us, some people side with China. The markets will stabilize a little bit, and they will get used to the new normal. And then the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates, and then you will have a lot of fast cheap money. And then it will pour into crypto because it will get reignited by the market structure bill (Digital Asset Market Structure and Investor Protection Act])and the Magnificent 7 [Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla] entering and the stablecoin bill… …and then you will have a huge wave of speculative interest come probably August or September into the markets. And that will carry through for probably another six to 12 months.” According to Hoskinson, the Federal Reserve will have room to ease the monetary policy over the coming months despite the tariffs. “It’s not intrinsically clear how inflationary the tariffs will be. There was an MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) report that came out, I think it was from the first Trump administration, where they looked at the 2018 tariffs. And even though there was a 10%, 25%, depending on the nature of the tariff the real inflation was only about 0.7%.” Bitcoin is trading at $84,540 at time of writing.

In an April 19 post on X, co-founder Du Jun—who also founded the Huobi exchange— announced that while ABCDE will not raise capital for a second phase or invest in new projects, it remains committed to supporting its current portfolio. Jun was clear that this move doesn’t stem from financial distress. Instead, it reflects a growing disillusionment with the state of early-stage crypto investing. “Many projects are extremely short-sighted and only think about how to get listed on the exchange as soon as possible,” Jun noted. “What is left behind is often a mess.” ABCDE has deployed over $40 million into 30+ ventures across three years, maintaining what Jun claims is a globally competitive internal rate of return. Its portfolio leans heavily into future-facing infrastructure: 28% in Bitcoin scaling tech, 16% in Ethereum LSDFi, and 12% in L2s and smart contract platforms , according to data from Cryptorank. Vernal Incubator Signals Next Chapter in Web3 Strategy While ABCDE presses pause on further investments, it’s not the end of Du Jun’s involvement in the space. Just weeks prior, he introduced a new incubator initiative named Vernal. The venture is set to reveal its first batch of incubated projects and shareholder lineup by May. Jun described Vernal as a strategic response to the prevailing issues he sees in the ecosystem. Instead of financial speculation, Vernal will focus on deep incubation and long-term value creation, steering away from the “hype-first, utility-later” attitude that has plagued recent fundraising cycles. This pivot comes shortly after ABCDE’s final investment in Soon (Solana Optimistic Network), an Ethereum Layer-2 that touts faster block times than Solana itself. The project raised $22 million via NFT sales to fuel its mainnet launch. Industry Voices Echo Call for Reform in Crypto Tokenomics Jun’s critique aligns with sentiments recently expressed by Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson at Paris Blockchain Week. Hoskinson urged the next wave of crypto projects to rethink tokenomics and embrace cooperation over competition. “You can’t build a global ecosystem this way,” he said, referring to adversarial market structures. “The incumbents are much larger.” With ABCDE stepping back and Vernal stepping in, the message is clear: longevity, not listing, is the new goalpost.

Platforms like Hartcoin allow even modest users to leverage mining technology to acquire steady income. This article explores future cloud mining trajectories and why millions of crypto investors are shifting to this lucrative opportunity. The Emergence & Growth Of Cloud Mining Crypto cloud mining emerged as a response to the expanding complexity and increased demand for crypto mining resources. Historically, Bitcoin mining could be attained using personal computers. However, due to the increasing number of miners, the mining hurdles increased. The need for Investors to own specialized hardware, known as Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), gradually became apparent. Due to this shift, the concept of crypto cloud mining was born to address the mining challenges. Instead of purchasing and maintaining very expensive hardware, Miners had an option to rent hash power from remote centres equipped with modern high-performance machines. This model allowed massive participation in crypto mining with zero technical and financial barriers. How to Start Cloud Mining Getting started with crypto mining is easier than you anticipate.

This suggests the bulls are extremely vigilant, and hence the upcoming events may have a bullish impact on the token. The XRP price is hovering around the crucial $2 mark and is trading within a range-bound consolidation. However, the XRP price has been trading under bearish influence, mainly due to the lack of bullish strength. Here’s the Catalyst for the XRP Price Rally! The Ripple community is eagerly waiting for an XRP ETF launch and its potential impact on its price. The experts believe that the SEC’s approval of a potential XRP ETF could be a great catalyst for the upcoming bull run. On the other hand, the rate cuts are expected to have a massive impact on the XRP price rally. Recently, the ECB slashed rates by 2.25% and markets reacted positively. Now that the XRP’s liquidity is on the rise, yet another rate cut may positively impact the XRP price rally. After the ECB’s rate cuts, the US SEC is also considering a rate cut, which may boost the upcoming XRP price rally. The recent trade war has already shaken up the entire market, which has regained strength. And hence, with a fresh rate cut, the XRP bulls are expected to get a fresh boost. Therefore, the investors remain hopeful of the upcoming XRP price rally with a potential ETF and a rate cut. How High Can the XRP Price Can Go in 2025? XRP price experienced one of the strongest and sharpest price surges during the last crypto rally. The price and the social engagements both went hand-in-hand perfectly throughout the entire XRP price surge and pullback. With this, the token has been one of the strongest altcoins in the market, as the bulls have been holding the rally above the crucial support zone. The daily chart of XRP suggests the price has reached the end of the consolidation, which is expected to trigger a strong breakout. The Ichimoku cloud has undergone a bullish crossover, and with a drop in the bearish pressure, the price is expected to set off a strong upswing. On the other hand, the CMF has initiated a bullish divergence and surged finely above 0, hinting towards the market turning bullish as bulls are gaining strength. Therefore, the XRP price is believed to rise, but a strong upswing may trigger only when the price reclaims $2.2 before the end of the month.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-19 13:48:10

Specifically, pseudonymous analyst CrediBULL highlighted the $1.60 mark as a potential turning point for the asset following an extended period of consolidation, as shared in an X post on April 19. The analysis is based on XRP’s price action and Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) divergence, suggesting a local bottom may have formed around the $1.60 area. XRP price analysis chart. Source: TradingView For the first time in weeks, price and spot CVD have started to diverge. While spot takers continue selling, typically reflected in a falling spot CVD, XRP’s price has begun to climb. This phenomenon, known as spot absorption, suggests that larger players may be stepping in to absorb sell-side pressure at a key support level. Therefore, this marks a clear shift from previous price behavior, where XRP typically moved in sync with spot CVD. CrediBULL sees this divergence as a key signal of a potential local bottom. The analysis also pointed to a completed corrective phase, with the latest upward move starting from the $1.60 “buy zone.” However, the bullish setup remains fragile and depends on broader market conditions. In this line, a drop in Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) price could still disrupt XRP’s recovery. XRP price to exit consolidation It’s worth noting that XRP currently remains in a consolidation phase, in line with broader market sentiment. In this context, pro-XRP analyst Dark Defender noted that technical indicators suggest the stalled price movement might be nearing its end. In an X post on April 18, the expert stated that XRP is approaching the final stage of its consolidation within the broader monthly structure, with price action tightening near a descending resistance trendline between $2.22 and $2.30. A breakout above this level could confirm the start of a strong impulsive move. XRP price analysis chart.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. In crypto’s race for speed and profits, compliance is emerging as the key to trust, growth, and long-term success. In the fast-paced realm of cryptocurrency, conversations often revolve around speed, profits, and new technology. Long-term users require compliance features above all else yet this essential element receives minimal focus in the market. For platforms looking to scale responsibly, adherence to global financial laws is not optional; it’s essential.

Without strong governance, even the flashiest platform is vulnerable to disruptions or legal scrutiny. And in a maturing crypto economy, those risks grow more tangible every year. A reliable way to identify strong compliance is by examining whether a platform operates in regulated markets, performs frequent audits, and shares performance data transparently. These aren’t marketing tricks, they’re markers of institutional credibility that separate the serious contenders from the speculative players. That’s why the most successful crypto participants often lean toward platforms with a verifiable legacy. A track record in traditional finance, adherence to regulatory standards, and transparent business operations signal a platform’s commitment to users. These companies are often ahead of the curve, not just following trends but creating the infrastructure that supports them. Case in point: MultiBank Group serves as a striking example of how traditional finance expertise can adapt to crypto’s demands. With headquarters in Dubai and operations worldwide, it has built a reputation through its global regulatory footprint. MultiBank established a new historical milestone when it hit $55.85 billion in daily trading volume on April 3, 2025 by demonstrating how compliance regulatory practices ensure operational stability and customer trust. The MBG Rewards Program by MultiBank serves as a pre-TGE (Token Generation Event) campaign, which allows users to receive token awards based on their participation in the blockchain ecosystem developments. Users can perform tasks that prove their dedication to the program and obtain initial access to MBG tokens before their public release. It’s a rare opportunity to become part of a forward-thinking community built on the foundation of financial credibility. The program’s structure aligns with MultiBank’s broader ethos: empower users without compromising on institutional-grade security and transparency. With over 2 million global customers, a consistent growth rate of 19% YoY, and profitability exceeding $275 million in 2023, MultiBank is a serious contender in the evolving crypto space. By 2030, the Group anticipates reaching $550 billion in daily trading volume, a target that reflects deep ambition and a clear strategy to get there. Choosing the right crypto partner is about more than flashy user interfaces or trendy staking options. It’s about aligning with platforms that understand the rhythm of both traditional and decentralized markets. In a world dominated by speculation, MultiBank Group brings discipline, legacy, and real-world financial intelligence to the web3 landscape. By embedding compliance into both legacy trading and digital finance ventures, MultiBank Group demonstrates a model for crypto platforms aiming to operate long-term. It’s not about stifling innovation, it’s about making sure innovation stands on solid ground. Conclusion Looking ahead, it’s clear that future regulatory standards will only tighten. Platforms investing in compliance today won’t just avoid disruption, they’ll lead the next era of global digital finance.

But Kiyosaki’s forecast comes amid warnings of what he expects will be “the biggest stock market crash in history.” In a recent tweet , the financial guru expressed concern about current economic indicators. This includes record-high credit card and U.S. government debt, rising unemployment, and troubled retirement accounts. “USA may be heading for a GREATER DEPRESSION,” he warned. MAKES ME SAD: In 2025 credit card debt is at all time highs. US debt is at all time highs. Unemployment is rising. 401 k’s are losing. Pensions are being stolen. USA may be heading for a GREATER DEPRESSION. I get sad because as I stated in an earlier X….Tweet….I warned… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) April 18, 2025 Kiyosaki emphasized that despite the grim outlook, investors still have time to position themselves advantageously. “The good news is you can still do something and maybe even get rich, very rich,” he stated. He reiterated his consistent advice to “buy gold, silver, and Bitcoin.” The financial educator suggested that even modest investments in these alternative assets could yield substantial returns during the economic downturn. “For those who take action today, when the crash crashes, those who invest in just one Bitcoin, or some gold, or silver… You may come through this crisis a very rich person,” Kiyosaki wrote. You might also like: Bitcoin price stuck in a range: volatility drops as market awaits breakout Bitcoin could hit $1 million by 2035 His specific timeline projects that by 2035, approximately ten years from now, Bitcoin could exceed $1 million per coin, while gold might reach $30,000 and silver $3,000 per ounce. “It will be the easiest money you ever made,” he claimed. This prediction comes as Bitcoin and precious metals have shown strong performance in recent months. In an April tweet , Kiyosaki noted, “Gold is at an all-time high, demand for silver is exploding, and Bitcoin is roaring.” He suggested these price movements signal deeper problems in the traditional financial system. The author blames current economic conditions on what he calls a “sinister global banking cartel.” He specifically cites central banks, including the Bank of International Settlements, Bank of England, Bank of Japan, European Central Bank, and the Federal Reserve. Some financial analysts dismiss Kiyosaki’s predictions as extreme and alarmist, but his advocacy for alternative assets as hedges against inflation and financial instability has gained popularity among investors concerned about monetary policy and government debt levels.

It is now trading in a narrow $2 – $2.10 range over the last few weeks. Whereas, a new altcoin, Yeti Ouro’s presale has garnered over $3.3 million in investments in just some weeks. This indicates a trend towards investor interest in blockchain projects with concrete real-world use cases, particularly in the fast-expanding GameFi sector. XRP Price Prediction Legal Overhang and Market Sentiment: While XRP typically outshines meme coins during bearish episodes, XRP price remained just over the $2.10 mark following Donald Trump’s suggestion that it be added to a U.S. strategic crypto reserve. Still, the presence of SEC nagging and Ripple’s extended court battle serves as a caution for institutional investors. Credits: TradingView XRP’s Lower Trading Volume: XRP daily volume has fallen back down to around $2.8 billion from more than $5 billion at the start of this quarter. This leads to lower liquidity, which in turn is often a negative for any asset. Utility: XRP was designed for cross-border payments, but it’s real-world adoption is pretty slow. Recent on-chain data shows that there is a modest pick-up in institutional flows, which is insufficient to cover up for this bearish sentiment in the presence of regulatory problems. Investors are thus turning to assets with good use-cases with community engagement, spaces where XRP’s roadmap remains foggy. Yeti Ouro’s Play-to-Earn (P2E) Model Draws Investor Interest In a time where most crypto projects are struggling and even the biggest names like XRP have stagnated, Yeti Ouro’s Stage 3 presale is nothing but a success. They have raised more than $3.3 million in capital and are still going strong. A steeper price increase has been confirmed for Stage 4 which is only 4 days away. Currently available for $0.024, the price is rising to $0.041 in the next stage. So, a great opportunity for investors to make quick profits even before the coin hits the exchanges. Further to this, Yeti Ouro is kicking off Easter weekend with a festive boost—offering a 30% bonus on all token purchases for a limited time. The promotion is live now and runs through Tuesday, April 22nd, 2025, marking the final countdown of Stage 3, with only four days to go. With a confirmed price jump coming in Stage 4, this is your moment to load up and lock in value before the next chapter begins. Don’t let this opportunity pass you by—make your move while the bonus is still on the table. Yeti Ouro’s main differentiator is Yeti Go. It is a racing game made with high-quality graphics and audio on Unreal Engine 5. The Yeti Go team has launched a creative community challenge—an open call for fans to design the next in-game character through a character design competition. The winning submission will not only be brought to life within the game but will also earn the creator full credit and a permanent place in the Yeti Go Universe. As an added reward, the top winner will receive $1,000 in $YETIO tokens, with ten runners-up each receiving $250 in tokens. For full entry details and how to get involved, visit Yeti Ouro’s official X platform . Yeti Go transforms the gaming landscape with a bold blend of cutting-edge visuals and immersive audio, offering an experience that feels more like an interactive blockbuster than a traditional game. Developed in collaboration with the acclaimed studio behind industry-defining hits like Call of Duty, Spider-Man, The Witcher, and Dead Space, every element has been crafted to pull players into a richly detailed universe. The sound design—shaped by professionals who’ve worked with Grammy-nominated artists such as Major Lazer, Vybz Kartel, and Kabaka Pyramid—injects raw emotion and high-energy intensity into the gameplay. Scroll down to meet the game’s main character and step into a world where action, style, and speed converge. The best part is that the game itself creates utility for YETIO tokens. You can use these tokens to make in-game purchases and more. You can also earn these tokens by winning races in the game and participating in contests. Safe and Secure: Yeti Ouro’s smart contracts have also been audited by SOLIDProof , a trusted firm and tokenomics also include a hard cap of a billion tokens with deflationary pressure caused by 5% burns. This is where it wins against XRP’s 100B total supply. XRP or Yeti Ouro: Best Buy In 2025 Investors are expanding exposure from mere payment tokens such as XRP towards tokens driving live ecosystems, solving new problems and expanding into growing industries. In the era of ‘earn‑while‑you‑play,’ products that offer engaging user experiences minimize churn rate. YetiGo’s racing game, based on skill, encourages retention, and XRP’s off‑chain use cases generate modest daily usage. Network Effects in Games versus Finance: Social gaming websites can build quick viral hits because people invite others to compete. You might suggest a game to your friend and also invite them to play with you. However, word of mouth and virality in payment tokens like XRP are pretty tough to achieve. XRP’s growth relies on banks onboarding a steadier, compliance‑focused process. Oppositely, Yeti Ouro’s gaming ecosystem is more likely to grow with the already growing blockchain gaming industry.

US recession bets hit 57%,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/polymarket-panic-us-recession-bets-hit-57/,"The online betting markets are freaking out after US President Donald Trump dropped the tariff bombshell. In reaction to this, the odds of a US recession in 2025 have skyrocketed and crypto traders are pricing it in. Polymarket, the wild west of crypto prediction markets, is now flashing a bright red warning for the economy. It is now pegging the odds of a 2025 recession at 57%. The odds are just climbing up after dipping down to 44% over the past week. However, the crypto linked prediction platform has nailed Trump’s 2024 win. Trump’s tariffs push recession odds to 57% Since returning to the office, Trump has been touting a Made-in-USA comeback and calling out countries that he claims have been “ripping off” America for years. In just weeks, the US has gone from a stable economic force to a source of chaos. Tariffs have been slapped on nearly everything, 25% on steel and aluminum, while 245% on Chinese imports. As per the data shared by Polymarket, recession bets now trade at 57¢, while “no recession” sits at 43¢. The rates peaked at 64¢ for the recession coming in and 36¢ over “no recession”. The tracker has recorded the odds hitting the highest of 66% on April 9. Soon after the spike, sentiments took a dip but the uncertainty prevailed and the odds are rising again. Source: Polymarket Even the giants are feeling the heat, Goldman now sees a 45% recession risk and JPMorgan 60%. Meanwhile, Trump is not backing down as he recently called tariffs “medicine” and said they’ll stay until trade deficits are “cured.” The odds for a US-China trade deal before June are hitting 38%. The chances of having a deal is trading at 38¢ while “No deal” sits at 63¢. However, traders at Polymarket believe that there are 91% chances of the Fed not changing the rates and just 8% think that a 25 bps cut might be there. Economists slash US growth to 1.4% Recession fears are now knocking hard on America’s door and a new Reuters poll shows economists placing the odds of a US recession in the next 12 months at nearly 50%. It went up sharply from just 25% a month ago. Trump’s 90-day pause on new tariffs hasn’t done much in this scenario. Inflation expectations have spiked, and economists have slashed their growth forecasts. The US economy is now expected to grow just 1.4% in 2025, down from 2.2% predicted just last month. That’s the sharpest downgrade since mid-2022. Economists say the real damage is being done by uncertainty and no one wants to invest or hire when the rules of the game could change overnight. This is becoming the defining feature of Trump’s economic policy. The global digital assets market which was over the moon when Trump stepped into the White House is suffering too. The cumulative crypto cap remained marginally up on Saturday to stand at $2.69 trillion. As of now, the biggest crypto, Bitcoin has dropped by more than 11% over the past 60 days. BTC is trading at an average price of $85,273 at press time. Its 24-hour trading volume dipped by 32% to stand at $12.4 billion.

Filed on Friday, the S-1 prospectus outlines the proposed Canary Staked TRX ETF, which aims to offer investors direct exposure to Tron (TRX), the ninth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. According to the filing, the fund’s investment goal is to track the price performance of Tron while enabling investors to earn additional rewards through staking. Staking Feature in ETFs Faces Regulatory Scrutiny Amid SEC Hesitation Staking allows holders of proof-of-stake (PoS) cryptocurrencies to contribute to network security and operations in exchange for periodic rewards. However, incorporating staking into an ETF has become a point of regulatory contention. The SEC has yet to approve any ETF that includes staking, citing potential investor risks and operational complexities. Earlier this week, the agency delayed a decision on whether Grayscale’s proposed spot Ethereum fund can include staking. Canary Capital, based in Nashville, Tennessee, is among a growing number of firms racing to bring altcoin-focused ETFs to market. The firm has also filed for ETFs tied to XRP, Sui, and Pudgy Penguins—part of a wider trend spurred by the strong performance of recently approved Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Canary has filed for first spot trx ETF… Currently 9th largest digital asset by market cap (approx $23bil). pic.twitter.com/emKm2DpHl9 — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) April 19, 2025 Since launching in early 2023, the 11 spot Bitcoin funds have attracted over $35 billion in net inflows. The new filing did not specify which exchange the proposed Tron ETF would list on, leaving that detail for future updates. TRX, the native token of the Tron blockchain, was trading at around $0.24 at the time of the filing, down 3% over the past 24 hours. However, the token has posted a strong 120% gain over the past year. Other major players such as BlackRock, Bitwise, VanEck, and 21Shares are also seeking SEC approval for altcoin ETFs, with industry experts pointing to XRP and Solana as the frontrunners for the next potential approvals. SEC Postpones Rulings on Staking and In-Kind Crypto ETF Rules Last week, the SEC delayed its decisions on proposed rule changes related to staking features and in-kind creations and redemptions for several cryptocurrency ETFs. The delay allows the regulator more time to evaluate the implications as its dedicated crypto task force continues work on shaping long-term digital asset policies. Final decisions are now expected later this year. The SEC’s crypto task force, created to develop clearer regulations for the industry, has already held meetings with several key stakeholders. In February, executives from Jito and Multicoin Capital met with the agency to push for staking-enabled ETFs that would allow investors to earn yield by locking up crypto assets. The task force has also reversed many previous enforcement actions targeting crypto firms. Among the delayed cases are the Grayscale Ethereum Trust and Ethereum Mini Trust, which sought to stake held ETH, and VanEck’s Bitcoin and Ethereum Trusts, which proposed allowing in-kind transactions using crypto instead of cash. The SEC has extended its deadlines for both proposals to June 1 and June 3, respectively.

While Pi Coin took a huge hit recently, Yeti Ouro (YETIO) keeps on thriving. Investors are particularly fond of its presale traction. At the time of writing, Pi Coin is at $0.6097, down by 18.38% from yesterday and down approximately 50% in the past 30 days. In contrast, YETIO’s presale now in Stage 3, with just 4 days remaining before moving onto the next stage, has collected more than $3.3 million! The price of its tokens have doubled since launch to $0.024, which is an indication that investors are hungry for utility-based choices. The 100% ROI has satisfied many early backers of the project.

On April 15, the token resisted repeated attempts to break through the $0.75 resistance mark, unable to hold momentum despite exhibiting a fleeting bullish engulfing pattern in weekly charts. By April 16, it had settled at $0.623, with trading volume plunging by 74% from its Apr. 5 high of $1.5 billion to $387 million. Technicals indicate bearish action: The relative strength index is at 42.9, which is indicative of weak buying pressure, while the MACD histogram is still on negative ground, which is indicative of persistent selling. Core issues pile upon Pi Coin’s distress PI’s Binance listing attempt was denied based on transparency issues, which drained investor confidence. Meanwhile, its market cap plummeted by 69% over one month from $13.07 billion to $4.03 billion as holders sold out due to skepticism from regulators and ongoing mainnet limitations. YETIO’s presale hype: Game utility convergence In marked contrast, Yeti Ouro is taking advantage of investor demand for structured ecosystems. YETIO’s presale has sold more 216 million tokens and raised more than $3.3 million. Yeti Ouro is kicking off Easter weekend with a festive boost — offering a 30% bonus on all token purchases for a limited time. The promotion is live now and runs through Tuesday, April 22nd, 2025, marking the final countdown of Stage 3, with only four days to go. With a confirmed price jump coming in Stage 4, this could be the moment to load up and lock in value before the next chapter begins. Don’t let this opportunity pass by — make a move while the bonus is still on the table. YETIO’s strength is in its synergy of gaming and blockchain: Yeti Go, Play-to-Earn (P2E) racing game built using Unreal Engine 5, enables players to get paid in YETIO through races. Yeti Go isn’t just played, it’s experienced. Designed in partnership with the award-winning team behind Call of Duty, Spider-Man, The Witcher, and Dead Space, the game delivers a rich, high-intensity journey that blurs the line between gaming and cinema. Its visuals are striking, but it’s the sound — sculpted by audio engineers with credits alongside Grammy-nominated artists like Major Lazer, Vybz Kartel, and Kabaka Pyramid — that truly brings the world to life. Every beat, every moment, is loaded with emotion and momentum. The Yeti Go team is calling on the community’s creativity with a fresh and fun initiative — a memecoin competition that invites participants to design the next in-game character. The winning design won’t just earn bragging rights, it will be brought to life in the game, with the creator credited and forever featured in the Yeti Go Universe. On top of that, the top entry will receive $1,000 in YETIO tokens, while ten runners-up will each take home $250 in tokens. Head to Yeti Go’s official X platform for full details and how to enter. Tokenomics also underpins YETIO’s argument. A supply of 1 billion capped YETIO includes 5% for burns that put deflationary pressure. A further 15% is used to supply gameplay rewards, which encourages long-term activity. A SOLIDProof audit combined with a roadmap with exchange listings and staking functions lend YETIO credibility, allaying security fears prevalent in meme-led initiatives. Investor sentiment: A flight from speculation to utility Unlike YETIO, Pi Coin’ s drop is part of a larger skepticism with regard to non-tangible use-case assets. Even with its novel mobile mining, Pi Coin’s price rests on speculative mainnet expectations, which have hit roadblocks through transparency controversies. In contrast, YETIO draws from the massive gaming sector worth $8.5-$314.3 billion , where blockchain is converging. It will provide fertile ground for tokens such as YETIO that combine entertainment with earning mechanics. Statistics indicate that holders of Pi Coin are migrating to YETIO. The community of Pi, which had numbered 30 million, is breaking down since delistings by exchanges such as Bybit and Bitget followed. Meanwhile, YETIO’s presale draws retail as well as institutional investors. The former’s limited-period 25% buy bonus and organized token burns are in stark contrast to Pi Coin’s model based on inflation, with 100 billion tokens overhanging its supply cap. PI vs. YETIO market outlook: Engineered growth vs. high risk Pi Coin’s fortunes depend upon regulatory clearances as much as mainnet development, but its 90% decline from all-time highs is indicative of waning patience from holders. Technical chartists caution that breaking below $0.56 will spell a bearish spiral with little supporting levels in front. YETIO, though, is designed for growth. Its presale success and gaming adoption put it in a position to capture the Play-to-Earn boom, with modeling anticipating a 10x pop to $0.24 after launch. Early investors might experience returns of as high as 208x in case the token grows to $5 by late 2025 — a far cry from Pi Coin’s stagnant speculative climb.

While the broader crypto market remains fragile due to rising macroeconomic tensions and geopolitical risks, ADA has managed to bounce back, gaining 25% from its early April lows. This recovery has sparked cautious optimism among bulls who believe momentum could continue if key resistance levels are reclaimed. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Stalls In Tight Range – Big Price Move Incoming? However, the rebound hasn’t gone unnoticed by larger players. According to on-chain data from Santiment, whales have taken advantage of the recent price upswing to offload more than 180 million ADA in just the past five days. This aggressive distribution suggests that while retail and mid-sized investors may be expecting a rally, some of the largest holders are opting to exit their positions. The contrasting behavior between whales and smaller cohorts reflects the broader market’s uncertain state. With no resolution in sight to the ongoing trade conflict between the US and China, and fears of a global economic slowdown mounting, bullish conviction remains fragile. The coming days will be pivotal for Cardano, as price action and on-chain signals continue to diverge in a market desperate for clarity. Cardano Whale Activity Sparks Debate Over Trend Direction Cardano is now testing a critical demand zone that may determine whether the recent recovery is sustainable or simply a temporary pause in a larger downtrend. After a steady decline that began in early March, ADA is attempting to establish support as global macroeconomic tensions continue to pressure financial markets. With investors growing increasingly risk-averse, many have chosen to offload both altcoins and Bitcoin to shield their portfolios from escalating volatility and negative sentiment surrounding trade conflicts, inflation, and regulatory uncertainty. Despite these headwinds, some analysts believe a potential breakout could emerge once current economic pressures begin to ease. But recent whale behavior has raised concerns. According to top analyst Ali Martinez, whales took advantage of ADA’s recent price upswing by offloading over 180 million tokens in just the past five days. This move has sparked debate over whether whales are simply securing profits before further uncertainty—or signaling a deeper continuation of the downtrend. If Cardano manages to hold its current support levels and attract renewed buying interest, a short-term rally may still be in play. However, failure to defend this zone could confirm bearish continuation, pushing ADA into lower territory. With market sentiment split and high-stakes developments unfolding globally, ADA’s next move could set the tone for its performance throughout the quarter. Related Reading: Solana Turns Bullish On 8H Chart – Break Above $147 Could Confirm New Trend ADA Stalls Below Resistance As Bulls Face Critical Test Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at $0.63 after several days of sideways movement and failed attempts to break above the $0.66 resistance zone. This level has capped recent upside momentum, signaling that bulls are struggling to gain control in the current environment of macroeconomic uncertainty and risk-off investor sentiment. To confirm a true bullish reversal and break the broader downtrend, ADA must reclaim the $0.75 level, which is aligned with the 200-day moving average. A decisive move above this mark would reestablish long-term strength and could open the door to a sustained recovery rally. Until then, ADA remains in a vulnerable position, caught between key resistance and fragile support. Related Reading: Over 1.9M Ethereum Positioned Between $1,457 And $1,598 – Can Bulls Hold Support? On the downside, losing the $0.60 level could trigger another wave of selling pressure. Such a move would likely push the price back toward the $0.50 support zone, a level not seen since earlier this year. As global markets remain on edge amid geopolitical tensions and investor uncertainty, ADA’s next move will depend on whether bulls can generate enough momentum to flip key resistance or risk further downside if sellers take over.

JPMorgan Chase and Bank of BNY Mellon have stopped electronically sharing data with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) following a severe breach of the regulator’s email system, Bloomberg reports . The OCC says it has notified Congress of a “major information security incident” involving unauthorized access to several of its executives’ and employees’ emails. The contents of the emails included “highly sensitive information relating to the financial condition of federally regulated financial institutions,” according to the OCC. Upon consultation with the Department of the Treasury, the OCC determined the incident met the conditions necessary to be classified as a “major incident.” According to people familiar with the matter, banks routinely provide financial information to the OCC that not only includes standard financial data, but also highly confidential information about terrorism, espionage and other investigations. JPMorgan and BNY both declined to comment, but a spokesperson for the OCC said the agency is working with cybersecurity experts to analyze the breach and further evaluate its IT systems. “This work is ongoing, and the OCC is engaged with its supervised institutions to keep them informed as these investigations progress… OCC’s onsite examiners continue to retain access to bank information as necessary to conduct supervisory activities, while ensuring the security of the data.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

A wallet linked to London-based investment firm Abraxas Capital acquired 2,949 Bitcoin ( BTC ) worth more than $250 million during the four days leading up to April 19. In the latest transaction, the firm bought over $45 million worth of Bitcoin from Binance on April 18, according to crypto intelligence firm Lookonchain, citing Arkham Intelligence data. Source: Arkham Intelligence, Lookonchain The investment came days after Michael Saylor’s Strategy bought $285 million worth of Bitcoin at an average price of $82,618 per BTC, as the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin holders signal continued confidence in Bitcoin, amid global tariff uncertainty. Large Bitcoin investors, or whales, continue accumulating, absorbing over 300% of Bitcoin’s yearly issuance as exchanges continue losing coins at a historic pace, Cointelegraph reported on April 18. Related: Spar supermarket in Switzerland starts accepting Bitcoin payments Crypto analysts eye quiet Easter weekend after weeks of turmoil Despite continued accumulation from whales and institutions, volatility concerns were raised by significant movements from the medium-term Bitcoin cohort, which holds coins for an average of three to six months. Over 170,000 Bitcoin entered circulation from the medium-term cohort, a development that may signal “imminent” crypto market volatility, according to pseudonymous CryptoQuant analyst Mignolet. “The effect of this metric on LTF moves is overstated as large onchain movement of coins hardly ever affects weekend price action since it’s not on liquid markets or CEX markets,” analysts at Bitfinex exchange told Cointelegraph, adding: “It is important to note that funding rates remain relatively flat currently. Moreover, US markets are closed as we have a long weekend for Easter, so volatility could be suppressed barring headlines from the White House.” Related: Crypto, DeFi may widen wealth gap, destabilize finance: BIS report Marcin Kazmierczak, chief operating officer of RedStone Oracles, added that the recent movements may be operational transfers, not necessarily signs of imminent selling pressure. Still, concerns over weekend volatility have been amplified over the past two weeks after the Mantra ( OM ) token’s price collapsed by over 90% on Sunday, April 13, from roughly $6.30 to below $0.50, triggering market manipulation allegations and highlighting “critical” liquidity issues in the industry.

Meme coins like Dogecoin are flexing their muscles with a market cap north of $23B, while quirky contenders like Cat in a Dog’s World (MEW) are up over 5% in the last 24 hours and clawing their way to mainstream status. But amidst the chaos and chart-watchers yelling “Buy the dip!” there’s one red-hot token everyone’s whispering about in Telegram threads and Discord DMs: BTFD Coin. BTFD Coin is in Stage 15 of its presale, and it’s looking like the last train is about to leave the station. With over $6.54 million already raised, more than 72 billion coins sold, and a booming Bulls Squad community of over 11,800 holders, this meme coin presale is writing its final chapter before May 26. What makes BTFD particularly spicy right now? The referral rewards program that’s stacking wallets faster than airdrops during an NFT bull run. BTFD Coin: Last Chance for Explosive Gains Referral rewards are the heartbeat of BTFD Coin’s meme coin presale, and they’re making early backers feel like crypto royalty. Here’s how this program works: connect your wallet, grab your referral code, and start sharing it. When someone uses your code to buy $50 or more worth of BTFD, they get 10% extra coins. And if you’re in the top 20 by volume? You get 10% of their total purchase in BTFD tokens. This isn’t just a feel-good pat on the back—this is real token gain with leaderboard bragging rights. This simple, gamified program turns every user into an ambassador, and that’s fuelling a frenzy as the presale heads into its final days. Here’s the kicker: analysts have their eyes on BTFD listing at $0.0006, with moonshot dreams targeting $0.006. If those predictions hold, a $6,000 investment at today’s Stage 15 price of $0.0002 could turn into a whopping $18,000 at listing. And if it hits that speculative moon price? Try $180,000. That’s a 2900% ROI that could make this the best crypto to buy now before the doors shut on May 26. Outside of juicy rewards, BTFD Coin brings more to the table: a high-APY staking protocol with average returns of 90%, a play-to-earn (P2E) game that fuels real token utility, and a squad of meme mascots (Baby Bull, Nerdy Bull, Raging Bull, and Peoples Bull) building a brand that’s both relatable and ridiculously fun. No do-overs. No turning back the clock. One more stage remains until this rocket launches, and it’s a long way down once the countdown ends. Dogecoin: Steady, Strong, and Still Barking Dogecoin’s the OG of meme coins, and it’s showing once again why it refuses to fade away. Currently priced at $0.156975, it’s up over 3.26% in the past 24 hours with a daily trading volume north of $760 million. Sitting at #8 on CoinMarketCap with a massive circulating supply of 148 billion coins, Doge isn’t just a meme—it’s a movement. Dogecoin benefits from community loyalty and mainstream recognition, not to mention the occasional Elon Musk tweet that can catapult it into trending territory overnight. With real-world integrations popping up across retailers and platforms like X (formerly Twitter), DOGE’s utility narrative is growing stronger. But in terms of explosive gains, Dogecoin’s current size makes it less likely to 10x overnight like smaller meme coins in presale phases. It’s a solid pick for stability in the meme coin sector, but when hunting for the best crypto to buy now for sky-high ROI potential, presale plays like BTFD Coin are catching more eyes. Still, DOGE has its place in the ecosystem—as a cultural icon and a crypto that continues to have staying power when others fade. Cat in a Dog’s World (MEW): Purring with Promise With a name like Cat in a Dog’s World, MEW is as bold as it is bizarre—but it’s working. MEW is up 5.37% in the last 24 hours and trades at $0.002296. With a fully diluted market cap of over $204 million and a trading volume nearing $24 million, MEW is scratching its way up the ranks, currently sitting at #174 on CoinMarketCap. What makes MEW pop is its cheeky branding and all-in-one attitude. Built on the cat vs. dog meme war, it leverages internet humor to build engagement while maintaining tokenomics that look sustainable. With its entire supply of 88.8 billion coins already circulating, it’s attracting those who missed the early DOGE train. MEW might be the underdog (or undercat?) in this meme coin race, but it’s proving it can play in the big leagues. It’s especially appealing to younger investors looking to grab a coin with pop-culture pull and potential. But again, for those hunting the best crypto to buy now and willing to risk more for a bigger payoff, nothing compares to jumping in on a meme coin presale like BTFD during its final phase. MEW is fun and feisty, but BTFD has that closing window of opportunity. Conclusion: Blink and You’ll Miss the Best Crypto to Buy Now When the countdown hits zero on May 26, BTFD Coin’s presale will be over. With just one stage left and a price of $0.0002, this is the final shot to secure what analysts believe could be a moonshot. For those watching the charts for the best crypto to buy now , this is not the time to hesitate. Get in. Grab your referral code. Earn your bonuses. And prepare for liftoff.

The price now sits around $8.40, still down more than 88% from its peak above $71 on Jan. 18. The recent unlock may spell further trouble for investors, who are estimated to have lost a total of $2 billion after purchasing the token earlier this year. Token unlocks typically flood the market with new supply and tend to depress prices. But in this case, the market appears to have priced in the release beforehand, potentially explaining the price uptick. Still, the $320 million unlock raises the risk of a large sell-off, especially given TRUMP’s thin liquidity. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that just $1.3 million could move the token’s price by 2% on major exchanges. The move also comes during the Easter holiday weekend, when trading volumes are subdued and price swings can be more pronounced. On social media, rumors are swirling about a possible event for large token holders, supposedly being organized by Trump himself. These claims remain unverified and highly speculative. Data from Dune analytics shows there are currently 636,000 TRUMP token holders on-chain, with just 12,285 wallets having more than $1,000 worth of the cryptocurrency.",Markets|Donald Trump|Memecoin|News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-19 14:56:39

New layer 1s (L1s) and side networks offer faster, cheaper transactions than ever before. Yet, a core challenge has come into focus: liquidity fragmentation — the scattering of capital and users across an ever-growing maze of blockchains. Vitalik Buterin, in a recent blog post , highlighted how scaling successes have led to unforeseen coordination challenges. With so many chains and so much value splintered among them, participants face a daily tangle of bridging, swapping and wallet-switching. While these issues affect Ethereum, they also affect nearly every ecosystem. No matter how advanced, new blockchains risk becoming liquidity “islands” that struggle to connect with one another. The real costs of fragmentation Liquidity fragmentation means there is no single “pool” of assets for traders, investors or decentralized finance (DeFi) applications to tap into. Instead, each blockchain or side network hosts its own siloed liquidity. For a user who wants to buy a token or access a specific lending platform, this siloing introduces multiple headaches. Switching networks, opening specialized wallets and paying multiple transaction fees are far from seamless, especially for those less tech-savvy. Liquidity is also thinner in each isolated pool, leading to price disparities and higher slippage on trades. Many users resort to bridges to move capital across chains, yet these have been frequent targets for exploits , raising fear and mistrust. If it’s too cumbersome or risky to move liquidity around, DeFi fails to gain mainstream momentum. Meanwhile, projects scramble to deploy across multiple networks or risk being left behind. Some observers worry that fragmentation could drive people back to a few dominant chains or centralized exchanges, undermining the decentralized ideals that fueled blockchain’s rise. Familiar fixes, with persisting gaps Solutions have emerged to tackle this tangle. Bridges and wrapped assets enable basic interoperability, but the user experience remains cumbersome. Crosschain aggregators can route tokens through a chain of swaps, yet they generally don’t merge the underlying liquidity. They only help users navigate it. Meanwhile, ecosystems like Cosmos and Polkadot bring interoperability within their frameworks, though they are separate realms in the broader crypto landscape. The problem is fundamental: Each chain views itself as distinct. Any new chain or sub-network must be “plugged in” at the ground level to truly unify liquidity. Otherwise, it adds another liquidity island that users must discover and bridge into. This challenge is compounded by chains, bridges and aggregators seeing one another as competition, leading to intentional siloing and making fragmentation even more pronounced. Integrating liquidity at the base layer Integration at the base layer addresses liquidity fragmentation by embedding bridging and routing functions directly into a chain’s core infrastructure. This approach appears in certain layer-1 protocols and specialized frameworks, where interoperability is treated as a foundational element rather than an optional add-on. Recent: What are exit liquidity traps — and how to detect them before it is too late Validator nodes automatically handle crosschain connections, so new chains or side networks can launch with immediate access to the broader ecosystem’s liquidity. This reduces reliance on third-party bridges that often introduce security risks and user friction. Ethereum’s own challenges with heterogeneous layer-2 (L2) solutions underscore why integration is essential. Different participants — Ethereum as a settlement layer, L2s focusing on execution, and various bridging services — have their own motivations, resulting in fragmented liquidity. Buterin’s references to this issue highlight the need for more cohesive designs. An integrated base-layer model brings these components together at launch, ensuring that capital can flow freely without forcing users to navigate multiple wallets, bridge solutions, or rollups. An integrated routing mechanism also consolidates asset transfers, mimicking a unified liquidity pool behind the scenes. By capturing a fraction of the overall liquidity flow rather than charging users for every transaction, such protocols reduce friction and encourage capital mobility across the network. Developers deploying new blockchains gain instant access to a shared liquidity base while end-users avoid juggling multiple tools or encountering unexpected fees. This emphasis on integration helps maintain a seamless experience, even as more networks come online. Not just an Ethereum issue While Buterin’s blog post focuses on Ethereum’s rollups, fragmentation is ecosystem-agnostic. Whether a project builds on an Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible chain, a WebAssembly-based platform, or something else, the fragmentation trap arises if liquidity is fenced off. As more protocols explore base-layer solutions — embedding automatic interoperability into their chain design — there’s hope that future networks won’t splinter capital further but instead help unify it. A clear principle emerges: Throughput means little without connectivity. Users shouldn’t need to think about L1s, L2s or sidechains. They just want seamless access to decentralized applications (DApps), games and financial services. Adopting will follow if stepping onto a new chain feels identical to operating on a familiar network. Toward a unified and liquid future The crypto community’s focus on transaction throughput has revealed an unexpected paradox: The more chains we create for speed, the more we fragment our ecosystem’s strength, which lies in its shared liquidity. Each new chain intended to boost capacity creates another isolated pool of capital. Building interoperability directly into blockchain infrastructure offers a clear path through this challenge. When protocols handle crosschain connections automatically and route assets efficiently, developers can expand without splintering their user base or capital. Success in this model comes from measuring and improving how smoothly value moves throughout the ecosystem. The technical foundations for this approach exist today. We must implement them thoughtfully, with attention to security and user experience. Opinion by: Jin Kwon, co-founder and chief strategy officer at Saga.

Analysts have identified resistance at $0.17 and support at $0.16, indicating that surpassing these levels could pave the way for substantial gains. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) in its presale phase, is garnering attention for its innovative decentralized lending platform. The project has raised more than $6.9 million and attracted more than 8400 holders. Both DOGE and MUTM are poised for significant movements, with DOGE leveraging its established presence and community support, and MUTM offering a fresh DeFi solution attracting early investors. Mutuum Finance Presale Accelerates with Strategic Growth Mutuum Finance is gaining traction as investor demand drives the ongoing Phase 4 presale. With a token price now at $0.025, early investors are boarding before a predicted 20% rise in Phase 5, to $0.03. With predictions of a market listing price at $0.06, strategic investors have the potential to make up to 140% in potential gains on the strength of the platform’s solid tokenomics and future utility. Thus far, Mutuum Finance has attracted over 8,400 investors and raised more than $6.9 million, indicating high faith in its decentralized lending-sustainable financial mechanics combined model. One of the particularly compelling long-term features of Mutuum is its Buy-and-Distribute feature. This operation continuously purchases tokens in the market and distributes them to stakers, stimulating steady demand as well as community incentives. In a market notorious for speculation and volatility, this consistent approach instills a welcome touch of order and longevity. To enhance retention of users, the group also announced a freshly constructed dashboard with a top 50 holder leaderboard, the owners of which will be rewarded with bonus tokens for maintaining their positions. The game-like tactic encourages retention and strengthens the community base. CertiK Audit Underway to Ensure Maximum Security In a move to drive security and transparency, Mutuum Finance is currently being smart contract audited by CertiK, a leading-blockchain security firm. The outcome of the audit will be posted on Mutuum’s official social media platforms, highlighting the platform’s commitment to safeguarding its users. Progressive Tech with mtToken Yield System Mutuum’s innovation is its mtToken technology through which users can earn passive yield as they tokenize ETH, DAI, and other assets into interest-bearing mtTokens. Those assets remain fully accessible, but liquid, providing an attractive choice for today’s DeFi users. For borrowers, it provides loans such as $5,000 USDT backed by $7,000 worth of ETH collateral. The digital loan-to-collateral ratio is secure and effective, providing the user with a seamless experience backed by open risk management. A Reliable Alternative in a Volatile Market Unlike a lot of the short-term hype-tokens, Mutuum Finance is building a stable foundation for long-term growth. With its Phase 4 presale winding down to conclusion, the $0.025 level presents a last window of entry opportunity for investors before the next price explosion. Analysts forecast appreciation, with some expecting MUTM to reach significantly higher levels as the project reaches maturity. For forward-thinking DeFi investors, Mutuum Finance provides a unique blend of innovation and reliability. Dogecoin (DOGE) shows bullish patterns, eyeing a potential breakout to $0.50. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), in its Phase 4 presale, is gaining traction with over $6.9M raised and 8,400+ investors. Tokens are priced at $0.025, with Phase 5 set to push prices to $0.03. The anticipated launch price of $0.06 offers investors a 140% return. As Phase 4 nears its end, MUTM offers a timely entry before further price increases.

The Ripple vs. SEC battle is over , and with a pro-crypto SEC boss now in place, XRP’s path seems clearer, making it a more appealing asset. Back in January, XRP reached a high of $3.39 , but the recent dip feels more like a reset than a full retreat. With IPO plans and XRP ETF filings generating bullish momentum, some analysts are still forecasting a potential dip, suggesting that for investors, this could be an opportunity to buy low before the next wave begins. XRP Price Prediction: What Next? According to market veteran Peter Brandt , there may be limited upside from the current price levels. He recently shared a chart predicting that XRP could end the year between $1.02 and $2 , signaling potential stagnation. Brandt is observing a head and shoulders pattern on XRP’s chart, and if the asset fails to hold above the $2 level, he believes a drop toward $1 could be in play. While this prediction may seem conservative, it’s based on classic chart analysis rather than market hype. On the flip side, Standard Chartered , a major global bank, has issued an XRP price prediction of $5.50 by the end of 2025, with the possibility of it climbing even higher to $12.50 by 2028. Meanwhile, crypto veteran Davinci Jeremie remains highly bullish, suggesting that XRP could even surge to $24 this year, pointing to support potentially coming from within the government. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Is Ethereum About to Crash? Peter Brandt Predicts Price Drop to $800 , When Will XRP Price Surge to $5? The overall crypto market remains in a wait-and-watch phase , with many altcoins, including XRP, moving sideways after a strong start to the year. According to Dark Defender , a respected crypto analyst, XRP is nearing the end of its months-long consolidation phase, with bulls defending the $2 level. Dark Defender believes this is the final stage before a potential breakout. Using a 5-wave pattern , the analyst predicts XRP could rally to $5.85 in the coming months, potentially achieving a fresh all-time high once Wave 5 kicks in. While the mood is cautious, the optimism is palpable as traders watch for a breakout. XRP News: Overcoming Ethereum in Market Cap In the latest XRP news , crypto analyst EDO Farina reported that XRP has officially overtaken Ethereum in Fully Diluted Market Cap, with XRP now valued at $208.4B compared to Ethereum’s $192.5B. Farina highlights that XRP has outperformed Ethereum for over six months, suggesting that the much-discussed “flippening” may already be in motion. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Taking place on May 14–16 in Toronto, Consensus 2025 will certainly include a session featuring Eric Trump, among other big names, addressing “American Bitcoin ” along with other large-scale agendas. “American Bitcoin” Unveiled: Game Changer or Gamble? The epicenter of interest for the conference is expected to be “American Bitcoin,” a venture suggesting new frameworks for Bitcoin mining in North America. Eric Trump , alongside Asher Genoot, the Hut 8 CEO and American Bitcoin Board Member, speaking about the “American Bitcoin” initiative, reveals that their intention is to become the world’s biggest pure-play Bitcoin miner with a targeted capacity of over 50 EH/s while accumulating strategic Bitcoin reserves. This level of ambition seeks to dominate narratives that support US world power, and in contrast, fostering greater institutional comfort could provide support for a Bitcoin-focused infrastructure. Surely, the inclusion of Eric Trump will spark conversations regarding integrating Bitcoin into mainstream finance and shift previously held views on Bitcoin. Even so, such initiatives, especially those on the scale of “American Bitcoin,” tend to get politically motivated commentary attached to them. Other challenges that are likely are dealing with large-scale mining’s complex red tape, ecology issues, politically motivated decentralization worries, central control fears of a supposedly decentralized network, and central command worries besides control over the layered structure issues and the execution risks of attaining such ambitious goals. The success of “American Bitcoin” will depend on balancing its grand vision with operational realities and community acceptance. Huge Buzz: FloppyPepe’s 125X Presale Promise While more traditional personalities talk about large-scale mining, FloppyPepe (FPPE) comes out on top as a presale darling, drawing interest from investors due to its unique combination of a meme and AI. The project’s initial presale price of $0.0000002 looks tiny, but considering the amount of attention it is bound to get thanks to the construction of the content-loving Internet and the ongoing boom the crypto world is experiencing in AI-related tools, there is already a reason for excitement. The presale’s achievement has resulted in positive forecasted prices, kindling the ambition of those seeking astronomical returns. Some analysts tracking the project are predicting a possible increase of 125X from the initial presale price, estimating that FloppyPepe could attain $0.000025 after the launch. This unprecedented potential gain is fueled by the unique marketing value propelled by AI technology and positioning the investment towards the aggressive, high-risk, high-reward traders. Under the Hood: FloppyPepe’s AI Tools & Audited Tokenomics FloppyPepe (FPPE) will not only use meme hype to propel them forward but also intends to release AI innovations such as the image generator “Meme-o-Matic” active on Telegram) and the upcoming “FloppyX” video generator. These allow meme community members to contribute and extend beyond the typical utility of meme coins, placing it at the intersection of two strong trends. This is centered alongside ‘Floppynomics’ — to incorporate a token burn, charity donations, and rewards to holders—aimed towards sustainability. Attention to community and user-generated content, and the project’s security focus marked by the successful smart contract audit from SolidProof , have built early investor confidence. The presale remains incredibly anticipated due to the combination of AI innovation, meme-ability, and baked-in audited security, even while some other more speculative targets suggest the price could reach $0.001 in more optimistic long-term scenarios. The Presale Playbook: Risk, Reward & Early Bets Undoubtedly, presales represent a high-risk, high-reward strategy in crypto investing. Tales of early investors in projects like Bitcoin capturing immense wealth still linger in the vastness of the internet. Skeptics never held back from questioning Bitcoin’s growing popularity, but clearly, all its early adopters became millionaires and billionaires. It goes without saying that most presale projects won’t reach such staggering heights (and many will simply fail), but they can yield very high returns if a project successfully executes its vision and garners substantial market adoption . Thinking of investing a small amount of money that is disposable – $100, $500 or $1000, in presales like FloppyPepe becomes a part of a well-diversified investment strategy. Relative to the initial stake, if the project achieves even a fraction (say the 125x forecasted potential), then the financial dividends will be transformative. If it does not gain traction, the loss is limited. Catch the AI Wave: Why FloppyPepe’s Presale Beckons The discussions regarding giant Bitcoin projects at Consensus do not thrill everyone. Some prefer the excitement offered by the FloppyPepe (FPPE) presale —a chance to participate in the grassroots innovation at the intersection of AI and crypto. Unlike purely conceptual projects, the presale’s focus on deploying functional AI tools such as Meme-o-Matic and FloppyX is proof of construction progress. The current value of $0.0000002 is bound to secure a position well ahead of the price increase anticipated in later stages or post listing. For investors looking to capitalize on current trends (AI and meme culture) and willing to adopt the risks involved, FloppyPepe is an enticing offering. These reflections indicate the opportunities to engage with and profit from a community should the project’s fusion of AI capacity and memes ignite popular interest.

Solana may reach a pivotal technical indicator that suggests a strong rally, while historical patterns for XRP hint at potential gains during the summer. This article explores which cryptocurrencies show promise for growth in Q2 and Q3 of 2025, potentially offering exciting opportunities for investors. Solana Market Snapshot: Past Performance and Current Price Dynamics Solana showed a modest monthly gain of 2.08% alongside a six-month decline of 17.28%. A strong one-week jump of 14.00% reveals short-term boosts amid longer-term pullbacks. Price movements indicate fluctuations without a steady upward drive, highlighting a mix of recent optimism countered by extended pressures. The current range sits between $97.94 and $165.67, with the nearest resistance at $206.76 and support at $71.30. Technical signals suggest some bullish pressure while overall sentiment remains cautious. Traders may look to test resistance near $206.76 and consider positions near support, keeping risk in check if prices dip further. XRP Momentum: Short-Term Dip, Long-Term Strength Over the last month, XRP dropped by roughly 18.5% while recording a powerful surge of nearly 280% over six months. Price movement over one week shows a slight gain of about 2.8%, indicating a mix of brief consolidation with a longer-term upward trend. Earlier price swings have highlighted the altcoin’s inherent volatility and recovery potential. Current prices trade between $1.66 and $2.77 with key support around $1.23 and immediate resistance near $3.45, while a secondary resistance stands at $4.56. Indicators such as the Awesome Oscillator and RSI near 47 suggest neutrality with no clear dominance by bulls or bears. Traders might consider buying near support and watching for moves at the resistance levels for potential exits. Conclusion Solana (SOL) has the potential to form a Golden Cross and may rise above $200 in the coming quarters. Historical data for XRP suggests a strong performance during the summer months. Both cryptocurrencies appear poised for significant gains based on current trends. Investors should keep an eye on both assets, as their performance could offer rewarding opportunities.

Most assets consolidated on previous double-digit gains, breaking resistance levels as positive news bolstered trader confidence. The total digital asset market cap surged 2% to $2.67 trillion, with weekly gains exceeding 5.5%. Solana Leads The Pack Solana’s weekly gains outpaced other top crypto assets due to high institutional demand. Over the last week, bulls bought huge amounts of Solana, driving up the asset’s value. Solana changes hands at $134.90, marking a large 16% this week. Several factors, including a soaring institutional appetite, whale accumulations, spot ETF speculation, and higher volumes drove this. For most bulls, the next price point for SOL is the $150 mark, which could trigger a further breakout after the market cap reaches $69.7 billion. While Solana maintained high weekly gains, other assets struggled as whales fell to macro tightening measures. Ethereum lost a chunk of its weekly gains after over 140,000 tokens were sold. As a result, ETH netted 2% weekly inflows, a poor performance compared to the projected 9%. Previously, crypto prices tumbled amid growing trade tensions in the United States. The impact on Bitcoin price triggered a massive outflow in altcoins. Although BTC price retested the $80k zone, weekly inflows slowed as traders perceived heated markets. BTC trades at $84,499, recording a 1% increase in the last seven days. Although BTC bulls netted gains in terms of long-term holder sentiment and the whale-to-exchange ratio, among others, retail investors retreated due to the lingering impact of the last dip. XRP saw 2.3% inflows over the past week, while meme coins also posted decent gains. Generally, altcoins recovered strongly despite mid-week offloads. Institutional Investors Behind SOL Rebound After the broader market recovery, institutional giants increased inflows, looking to get in favorable positions ahead of the next rally. Solana remains an institutional favorite, attracting more inflows ahead of expected spot SOL ETF approvals in the United States. The asset also notched inflows into institutional funds after weeks of low trading, signaling a turnaround from larger players. Crypto enthusiast Johnny restated SOL bull sentiments in the event of a spot ETF approval. “I think one of the smartest plays during this sell-off is accumulating a Solana position in anticipation of the SOL ETF later this year.” The prospects can be likened to the massive institutional demand after the approval of spot Bitcoin products last year.",Cryptocurrency|News|SOL|Solana,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-19 15:12:18

Should Trump fire Jerome Powell? Will The US lose reserve currency status? I answer your questions pic.twitter.com/S7Q6hANR3H — Anthony Pompliano (@APompliano) April 18, 2025 Pompliano’s comments come after Trump called out Powell on his truth Social post for not cutting the interest rates soon, as he said “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” He noted that the Fed already seems political to some and warned that firing Powell could only make things worse. Not Sacrificing Fed Independence for Crypto Gains Anthony, despite being a known critic of the Fed himself, remarked that it’s wrong to fight wrongdoing with more wrongdoing. He stressed that protecting the Fed’s independence is more important than the short-term gains. While he acknowledged that rate cuts often boost crypto markets, especially Bitcoin, he emphasized that such gains shouldn’t come at the cost of damaging a key financial institution. Senator Warren Says It Could Crash Markets Senator Elizabeth Warren also warned that firing the Fed Chair could seriously hurt investor confidence and crash the markets. In an interview with CNBC, she said that if the Fed is seen as controlled by the President, then it could harm the US economy and make America look like any other “two-bit dictatorship” instead of a stable democracy. “A big part of our economy strong, and a big part of the world economy strong, is the idea that the big pieces move independently of politics,” Warren said during an appearance on CNBC. Pompliano agreed with the concerns, warning that such a move sets a dangerous precedent where future monetary policy decisions might be driven by politics rather than data. If investors begin to believe the Fed is no longer impartial, the consequences could be serious, he says. The Climate Is Changing! Earlier this week, Powell said that it’s time for clear rules on stablecoins and acknowledged that digital assets are now firmly on the Fed’s radar. In a speech at the Economic Club of Chicago , he said, “The climate is changing,” highlighting crypto’s growing role in the financial system. Trump and some Republicans have renewed pressure to remove Powell over his cautious stance on rate cuts. The Fed last cut rates in December 2024. While Powell insists on seeing clear signs of falling inflation before making any moves, Trump is concerned that other central banks like the ECB have already cut rates multiple times in 2025. Opportunity For Bitcoin? At the same time, experts believe that if the US dollar weakens due to the uncertainties, it could actually help Bitcoin. They believe that a weaker dollar could drive more people to invest in crypto to protect their money. Why did Pompliano criticize Trump’s call to fire Powell? Pompliano warned that this would undermine the Fed’s independence and hurt investor confidence, particularly in Bitcoin and global markets. Why is Trump critical of Powell’s rate policy? Trump criticized Powell for not cutting rates quickly enough, and is frustrated that other central banks have already made cuts.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-19 15:12:27

Dogecoin has recorded improved growth metrics, including a 6% jump in activities and an attempted price recovery. The broader market has also seen slight day-to-day gains as bull projections align with trader sentiments. Will DOGE Hit $5.60? The crypto community debated the prospects of Dogecoin’s future amid recent market headwinds. While skeptics limit the asset’s growth based on frequent dips and meme coin corrections, bulls remain unfazed. Crypto analyst Dogegod projected a rise to $5.6 on X, citing breaking falling wedges. This massive forecast was backed up by DOGE holders, who showed positive futures market data and institutional demand. CoinGlass data points to a 5% rise for Dogecoin in the futures market. At the moment, total amount committed soared to 9.87 billion DOGE, worth approximately $1.54 billion, igniting bull reactions. Dogegod didn’t give a timeline for his projection, but many expect it to be in the long term, probably after the next bull run. While the community’s opinion may differ, DOGE price has traded negatively after fresh optimism thrilled traders of a potential $1 mark. In recent years, Dogecoin holders picked the price level as a mega bullish breakout point. If the asset breaches $1, the next level after the psychological barrier will tap multiple all-time highs. At press time, Dogecoin trades at $0.1580, a 2.3% surge over the past 24 hours as the recovery continues. The meme coin slumped 9% this month following jolted prices due to President Trump’s tariffs , but recent positive growth propelled the market cap past $23.5 billion as volumes spiked. Crypto whales also scooped up the asset after reduced sell pressures in meme coins. Meme Coins Ride On Wider Crypto Wave Traditionally, meme coins spike as positive sentiments are recorded in Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins. Fund flows are due to a community frenzy and expanding trader options. On the flipside, a drop in Bitcoin price leads to a crash in meme coin values, as seen this year. After over 22% of the BTC market cap was erased, meme coins lost over $15 billion. However, a new market trend has offered meme coin a new lifeline. Bitcoin rose 1.2% while XRP amid Ethereum’s (ETH) soared 2.2% and 0.3% respectively.

Investors are closely watching Dogecoin and Shiba Inu , sensing the perfect moment to act. With signs hinting at a strong future performance, now might be the opportune time for strategic moves. Find out why these coins are positioned for a potential surge. Dogecoin: Recent Price Shifts and Live Market Outlook Over the past month, Dogecoin dipped nearly 11% while a six-month gain of about 12% shows signs of recovery. The coin traded between $0.13 and $0.23 during this period, reflecting volatility amid market adjustments. Price fluctuations hint at cautious sentiment as investors weigh short-term losses against a medium-term rebound. The current range from $0.13 to $0.23 finds support near $0.08 and faces initial resistance at $0.28, with another barrier around $0.38. Bears are exerting some downward pressure, yet no clear trend is prevailing. Traders might consider entries near support with measured targets at resistance levels, keeping an eye on momentum and a neutral RSI around 46. SHIB Price Overview: Recent Declines and Key Levels for Traders A decline of 5.72% marks the monthly performance while the six-month drop reaches 35.89%. A minimal weekly change of -0.08% indicates a period of consolidation amid prolonged downward pressure. The sustained slide has built selling interest, reflecting broader market sentiment without notable short-term movements. Traded between $0.00001 and $0.000015, the coin faces immediate resistance at $0.000018 and finds support near $0.0000081. Secondary levels show resistance at $0.0000227 and support at $0.00000326. A neutral RSI close to 49 suggests no defined trend, with bears currently in control. Trading strategies may involve watching for a breakout above resistance or considering short positions if the price retests support. Conclusion DOGE and SHIB present a timely entry opportunity before their anticipated increases in value. Historical data and market sentiment favor these coins. Buying now could lead to potential gains as market momentum grows. Both coins show signs of future growth based on current trends. This is a strategic moment to invest in DOGE and SHIB before they potentially rise again. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

TokenTerminal data indicate that Tron has generated over $985 million this year, making it the second most profitable player in the cryptocurrency industry, after Tether ( USDT ).

It has remained between the support at $0.2165 and the resistance at $0.25, Tron has moved above the 50-day moving average and formed a bullish divergence as the MACD and the Relative Strength Index have continued rising.

A move above that level will indicate more gains. The next point to watch is $0.3085, which had its highest swing on Dec. 16. A drop below the support at $0.2165 will invalidate the bullish forecast.

Hyperliquid (HYPE) , Filecoin (FIL) , and Gala (GALA ) are drawing eyes from enthusiasts and investors alike. Delving into their current performance could reveal exciting trends and opportunities. Discover why these digital assets are generating buzz in the crypto community today. Hyperliquid Surges with Over 80% Growth in Six Months Hyperliquid posted a one-month gain of 15.84% and an impressive six-month surge of 80.84%. A one-week jump of 15.12% highlights rapid increases over short periods. The coin’s performance shows consistent upward momentum and rising investor interest. These gains indicate strong buying activity, suggesting that the coin has established a solid foundation for potential future moves. The coin currently trades between $9.68 and $18.70, with key support at $6.38 and resistance at $24.40, while a second resistance forms at $33.41. Indicators reflect a slight bullish tilt with an RSI near 64 and positive momentum. Traders might look to enter near support or aim for a breakthrough above the first resistance to capture further upside potential. Filecoin Faces Pressure Amid Significant Price Drops Filecoin experienced a sharp decline, with a 19.63% drop over the past month and a 37.53% fall during the last six months. A minor rebound of 1.43% over the week hints at brief recovery attempts, yet the overall trend remains decidedly bearish. Price performance over these periods shows mounting pressure and a persistent challenge to regain previous highs. The coin currently trades between $2.29 and $3.44, with key support near $1.79 and resistance at $4.10. Bearish signals dominate as oscillators and momentum indicators remain weak and the RSI hovers below bullish levels. Traders might look for opportunities to enter positions within these bounds, awaiting clear directional moves beyond the identified support or resistance levels. GALA Price Insights Amid Recent Corrections The past month GALA saw a drop of around 16.57%, while the six-month trend carried a steeper decline of roughly 36.66%. Weekly gains near 8.19% hint at some short-term recovery after a prolonged downward phase. Prices linger between $0.0118 and $0.0203, reflecting a mixed performance over recent periods that has kept investors cautious despite intermittent rallies. Current price levels face nearby resistance at $0.0257 and solid support at $0.0087, with a secondary resistance around $0.0342. The balanced RSI near 50.85 and technical indicators suggest neutral to slightly bearish sentiment. A cautious approach trading between these key levels may be favored, with buyers waiting for a bounce at support and sellers guarding potential resistance. Conclusion HYPE , FIL , and GALA show strong potential today. HYPE is gaining traction for its innovative features. FIL continues to grow due to its unique storage solutions. GALA draws attention with its gaming ecosystem. These coins are worth keeping an eye on for their promising developments and market performance.

In a notice posted on its website, Hertz says that its vendor, Cleo Communications US, witnessed a zero-day vulnerability exploit late last year that enabled thieves to siphon customer data. Notifications on various state government websites show at least 100,000 people are affected. Hertz says the data breach exposed customer information, including names, contact details, credit card records and driver’s license numbers. Hertz also says that a “very small number of individuals” had their Social Security numbers, passport records, Medicare or Medicaid IDs and entries related to vehicular accident claims exposed as well. “On February 10th, 2025, we confirmed that Hertz data was acquired by an unauthorized third party that we understand exploited zero-day vulnerabilities within Cleo’s platform in October 2024 and December 2024. Hertz immediately began analyzing the data to determine the scope of the event and to identify individuals whose personal information may have been impacted.” Hertz says it uses Cleo as a file transfer platform for “limited purposes,” and that the vendor immediately took steps to address the security gaps. Hertz has not disclosed how many of its customers were affected by the data breach. The firm also sent letters to its customers to disclose the security incident while offering free identity monitoring services to individuals whose records were stolen. “While Hertz is not aware of any misuse of personal information for fraudulent purposes in connection with the event, we encourage potentially impacted individuals, as a best practice, to remain vigilant to the possibility of fraud or errors by reviewing account statements and monitoring free credit reports for any unauthorized activity and reporting any such activity.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The announcement comes after Spar announced a partnership with DFX Swiss to enable Bitcoin transactions as a payment method. Spar To Accept Bitcoin Payments DFX Swiss announced the partnership on April 17 through a LinkedIn update, adding that the payment system will use the Bitcoin Lightning Network, enabling quick and low-cost transactions. The supermarket has started accepting Bitcoin payments at its store located in Zug, often called “Crypto Valley,” to reflect Switzerland’s growing acceptance and adoption of digital assets and their associated technologies. Switzerland is fast emerging as a global leader in crypto adoption, with cities like Zug and Lugano at the forefront of initiatives to integrate Bitcoin into everyday transactions. Lugano, in particular, made headlines with its initiative to make Bitcoin a de facto legal tender in the city. The plan, supported by Mayor Michele Foletti, has enabled Bitcoin payments for taxes, public services, and hundreds of local merchants. The city has also announced a partnership with Tether to establish a technology education center and startup fund. The payment system was listed on the BTC Map, a community-run project that tracks stores and businesses accepting Bitcoin. There are currently 1013 businesses in Switzerland accepting Bitcoin payments. DFX Swiss stated in a press release, “This SPAR location is among the first supermarkets in Switzerland where you can pay directly at the checkout using Bitcoin via LNURL. The implementation could pave the way for expansion across SPAR’s network of over 13,900 stores in 48 countries, which serves approximately 14.7 million customers daily.” Meanwhile, Bitcoin Association Switzerland Director Rahim Taghizadegan highlighted the system’s simplicity, stating, “Just scan a static QR code, send sats, immediate and easy registration by the cashier. This user-friendly approach aligns with Switzerland’s vision of making Bitcoin transactions accessible to everyday consumers.” Spar Joins Retailers Adopting Bitcoin Switzerland’s Bitcoin-friendly stance has attracted several Bitcoin and crypto companies and initiatives. Besides Zug and Lugano, several cities are exploring similar programs, supported by a robust banking sector that has embraced Bitcoin and other digital assets. Spar builds on this foundation and joins other Swiss retailers in accepting Bitcoin payments. The move could also influence other companies in the retail sector to adopt Bitcoin and other digital assets. Spar is one of the largest grocery chains in the world, with over 12,900 stores in 48 countries. The company serves over 14 million customers every day and employs 450,000 people.

The flagship cryptocurrency has been locked in a narrow sideways range all week. Volatility has dried up and price action remains muted. BTC is marginally up over the past 24 hours and trading around $85,190. Robert Kiyosaki Makes Another Bitcoin Prediction Renowned author Robert Kiyosaki has predicted that Bitcoin could rally to $1 million by 2035, fueled by an economic crash and burgeoning US debt. BTC is marginally up over 1%, having crossed $85,000. Despite adverse macroeconomic conditions, Bitcoin ETF inflows and bullish sentiment continue to push the price higher. Kiyosaki warned investors of a “greater depression” fueled by record-high US debt, rising unemployment, and collapsing 401(k)s. He reiterated advice from his books, including Rich Dad and Poor Dad and Rich Dad’s Prophecy, and urged traders to buy Bitcoin , Gold, and silver to weather the incoming crisis. “If a poor person bought a few ounces of gold or silver or 1/2 of a Bitcoin I predict they may become the new rich. Once this Depression is over, I strongly believe, by 2035, that one Bitcoin will be worth over $1 million. Gold will be $30k, and silver $3,000 a coin. It will be the easiest money you ever made.” Bitcoin Whales Keep Strong Accumulation Trend Bitcoin has entered a consolidation phase after enduring weeks of selling pressure and heightened volatility. Despite failing to break past the $90,000 level, BTC has not ceded ground to the sellers and held firm above $80,000 despite the broader market sinking into deeper losses. Despite BTC’s resilience and stable price action, macroeconomic adversities persist thanks to Donald Trump’s tariff policies and escalating trade tensions between the US and China. However, on-chain metrics suggest Bitcoin whales remain confident. According to data from Glassnode, wallets holding more than 10,000 BTC continue to accumulate, with their trend score near 0.7, suggesting sustained bullish sentiment among long-term holders. Meanwhile, smaller wallets containing less than 1 BTC to 100 BTC have started easing distribution, with the 10-100 BTC group approaching a 0.5 trend score. Lyn Alden Scales Back Bitcoin Forecast Macroeconomist Lyn Alden believes Bitcoin will finish 2025 higher than its current price of $85,000. However, she stated that it could have been significantly higher had it not been for President Trump’s tariff announcement in February. “Before all this tariff kerfuffle, I would have had a higher price target. My guess is that we end up higher at the end of the year than we are now, at least.” According to Alden, a massive liquidity unlock could push Bitcoin to reach more optimistic targets, similar to those before Trump introduced tariffs. Alden stated there was a good chance Bitcoin would reclaim $100,000 before the end of the year. However, she emphasized the broader financial market down days will remain a challenge for the flagship cryptocurrency, especially since Bitcoin trades 24/7, unlike traditional markets with specified trading hours. Alden stated that crypto’s round-the-clock trading contributed to its volatility, particularly when markets are jittery. “Because it trades 24/7, if people are worried about how things are going to open on Monday, some pools of capital can sell their Bitcoin on a Sunday and prepare.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis BTC has entered a narrow range, with prices moving sideways all week. BTC’s rejection around the $86,000 level set the tone for the week. While the flagship cryptocurrency has been relatively stable this week, analysts believe volatility will return, with many predicting an imminent rally. CryptoQuant contributor Mignolet pointed out that 170,000 BTC had been moved from the 3-6 month holder cohort. Historically, such large movements have preceded notable price movements. Another analyst, Master of Crypto shared an observation about the realized price of the short-term holders (STH) versus long-term holders (LTH). According to the analyst, most STHs are primarily in the red, with a realized price of $92,700. On the other hand, LTHs have a realized price of $26,500, meaning they are sitting on gains of over 200%. BTC saw considerable movement towards the end of the previous week, rising over 8% on Wednesday to cross $80,000 and settle at $82,600. However, the rally lost momentum on Thursday, dropping almost 4% to slip below $80,000 and settle at $79,592. Sentiment changed on Friday as buyers returned to the market. As a result, BTC rose almost 5% to reclaim $80,000 and settle at $83,370. Buyers retained control on Saturday as the price registered an increase of 2.41% to cross $85,000 and settle at $85,378. Despite the positive momentum, BTC was back in the red on Sunday, dropping almost 2% and settling at $83,776. Source: TradingView BTC started the current week positively despite waning momentum, rising over 1% to $84,619. However, price action turned bearish on Tuesday as BTC fell 1.08% to $83,701. BTC recovered on Wednesday, registering a marginal increase and then rising 1.11% on Thursday to settle at $84,962. The price fell back in the red on Friday, registering a marginal decline and settling at $84,518. The current session sees BTC up almost 1%, going above $85,000 and trading at $85,354. With analysts expecting a jump, BTC could reach $90,000 if buyers retain control. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

One such trader, renowned for forecasting Solana’s (SOL) ATHs in both 2021 and 2025, has now turned attention to a new performer, Mutuum Finance (MUTM). MUTM is an Ethereum-based decentralized finance (DeFi) token that has been gaining traction for its innovative dual-lending model. The altcoin MUTM presale is already live, and tokens are being sold for $0.025, and up to this point, the platform has raised $6.9 million. Over 8,400 investors are on board, and the majority expect the price to hit $0.03 in the next round. Investors in this round stand to gain up to 140% ROI when the token’s anticipated launch price of $0.06 is reached. According to the trader MUTM will 54x to $3.24 after launch. Mutuum Finance: A New DeFi Behemoth in the Making Mutuum Finance transforms the decentralized lending world through its exceptional dual borrowing system which drives broad market adoption. Mutuum Finance gained support from over 8,400 investors during its presale period which has resulted in raising $6.9 million for the project. Early adopters who participate in Phase 4 will benefit from monumental gains because the token price is $0.025 but Phase 5 will bring it to $0.03. According to experts MUTM has the potential to reach more than $6 by the end of this year beginning at its initial offering price of $0.06 due to its innovative lending system which addresses the growing requirements of DeFi platforms. The game-shifting model of Mutuum Finance drives its increasing popularity because it operates as a solid token although undervalued. A real-time leaderboard of the top 50 holders of MUTM has been activated by MUTM. Successful token holders who do not fall below their position will be rewarded with bonuses that amplify both their position value and long-term investment in MUTM. The growing interest of investors in utility-based projects over hype-based projects is indicative of MUTM’s success at being able to demonstrate profitable substance-based cryptocurrency projects. Disrupting DeFi Lending with a Two-Model Approach Mutuum Finance is revolutionizing the DeFi lending landscape with its innovative merge of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models. The P2C model is enabling users to earn passive income by lending their USDT through automated liquidity pools managed by smart contracts. Users can now start direct Peer-to-Peer transactions without depending on third parties because of the P2P model which gives users total control over their assets. Mutuum Finance combines the P2P system with P2B to provide streamlining operations and profitable investment opportunities for users. Fueling Community Growth with Reward Programs To enhance its user base Mutuum Finance has established various incentive plans for acquisition. The platform devotes $100,000 to give ten investors each $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. The platform provides rewards to users who successfully refer potential new users to join the platform. New users who join early receive extra advantages such as stake pool preferences as well as governance participation options and elite community communications which enhance their connection to the platform. While the trader who accurately predicted Solana’s (SOL) ATH is now eyeing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for a 54x ROI in 2025, the project’s innovative dual-lending model is already attracting significant attention. With the presale raising $6.9 million from over 8,400 investors, MUTM is on track for a price jump from $0.025 to $0.06 at launch, offering early investors up to 140% ROI. The platform’s hybrid P2C and P2P approach, alongside robust community incentives, positions MUTM as a top contender in the DeFi space.

The story was a little different for the Solana price, which is showing strong signs of resurgence in the last few days. The Solana token has had a mixed price performance so far in 2025, running to as high as $260 in January and then losing half of its value three months later. Building on its latest recovery, a crypto trader has postulated on the social media platform X that the altcoin seems to be gearing for a significant run to the upside. Can SOL’s Resurgence Fuel A Bigger Rally? In an April 18 post on X, a crypto analyst with the pseudonym Cryptollica shared an exciting analysis of the Solana price. According to the chart highlighted by the online pundit, the price of SOL just bounced back from a critical support level, which could catalyze a move to around $2,000. Related Reading: Cardano Price Surge To $1.7: Here Are The Factors To Drive The Recovery As observed in the chart, the Solana price appears to be persisting in an ascending channel on the one-hour timeframe. An ascending channel is a technical analysis pattern characterized by two major (upward-sloping) trendlines: the upper line linking the swing highs and the lower line connecting the swing lows. The token’s price often persists within the ascending channel, with the upper trendline often serving as resistance and the lower boundary line serving as a support zone. Investors can trade as prices swing between the pattern’s support and resistance levels or enter a position following a breakout (indicating trend continuation) or breakdown (suggesting trend reversals). The highlighted chart shows that the Solana price has been in and out of this ascending channel since mid-2020 before breaking out during the 2021 bull run. However, the price of SOL returned within the channel following the crash of the FTX exchange in November 2022. The Solana price has persisted within this channel since 2022, finding cushion at the lower boundary line numerous times. The most recent bounce-back from this trendline came in March after the altcoin’s price fell toward the $100 level. If this support level continues to hold strong, there is a likelihood that the price of Solana could travel to as high as $2,000 by mid-2026. However, it is also worth noting that the SOL token would need to overcome a crucial resistance zone around $295. On the flip side, if the altcoin breaches and closes beneath the lower trendline, it could fall to as low as $20. Solana Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of Solana stands at around $134, reflecting no significant change in the past day. According to CoinGecko data, the cryptocurrency is up by more than 10% in the past seven days.

Considering the futures market sentiment, the next breakout or rejection could spark major volatility. Technical Analysis By Edris Derakhshi The Daily Chart As the daily chart suggests, BTC has managed to recover from the March sell-off and is now trading just below the 200 DMA, located around the $88K mark, which is acting as a strong dynamic resistance. The recent structure shows short-term higher highs and lows, but the price is still capped below the $88K level. The buyers need a clean daily close above this zone and the 200-day moving average to open the door toward $92K and eventually, the $100K level. If the price gets rejected again, the $80K region will be key for maintaining a recovery structure. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, Bitcoin has broken above the long-term descending trendline and is consolidating just below the $86K–$88K supply zone. The structure shows higher highs and higher lows, indicating bullish momentum. However, the price action has been choppy recently, with multiple rejections from the $86K area. The RSI is also gradually rising but hasn’t reached overbought yet, meaning bulls still have fuel, but they need to show conviction. A confirmed breakout above $88K could trigger a fast rally in the coming weeks. Sentiment Analysis By Edris Derakhshi Open Interest Looking at the futures market sentiment metrics, the open interest is climbing again, now sitting around $28B as the price hovers around the $85K mark. This rising OI trend suggests growing speculative activity in the derivatives market. Historically, sharp increases in OI during sideways or slightly bullish price action often precede major volatility. If the market breaks higher, the stacked long positions could fuel a squeeze to the upside. But if resistance holds and price reverses, a long liquidation cascade is likely. Either way, the next major move will likely be amplified by this buildup in leverage.

According to the crypto analytics platform, short-term holders hanging on to unrealized losses relative to BTC’s current price are analogous to the early bear market conditions present during Bitcoin’s previous cycles. “Bitcoin unrealized losses normalized by percentage drawdown show that short-term holders are already holding substantial losses relative to the current correction depth – comparable to early bear market conditions in past cycles.” Source: Glassnode Glassnode goes on to note that while long-term holders are in profit, market conditions could cause them to see their profits dwindle, another sign of an upcoming bearish phase. “On the other hand, long-term holders (LTH) are still broadly in profit, but as BTC top buyers age into LTH status, loss absorption may rise. Historically, this shift often marked the confirmation of a bear market, though no such regime is evident yet.” Source: Glassnode Short-term Bitcoin holders are traders who have held on to their tokens for less than 155 days, while long-term holders are defined as those who have kept their digital assets inactive for 155 days or longer. According to Glassnode, one metric, which measures the directional dominance of value flowing in or out of a network, shows that the top crypto asset by market cap is at a crucial crossroads in terms of market direction. “Meanwhile, volatility-adjusted net realized profit/loss for BTC has reverted to its long-term median. This historically marks the boundary between bull and bear regimes, placing the market at a critical juncture for determining direction.” Source: Glassnode Bitcoin is trading for $84,557 at time of writing, a fractional decrease during the last 24 hours.

The rumor began when the official website for Trump’s memecoin created a new page about the dinner in question. The page currently requires visitors to provide a password. No information has yet been shared about when and where the dinner will be held. Related News: Switzerland Has a New Development on Bitcoin Adoption - Slowly Becoming a BTC Country The fact that Trump created a page about this meeting on his official website is actually strong evidence that the dinner will indeed be organized, but let's note that there is no official confirmation yet. After the rumor spread, the TRUMP token experienced a sudden increase during the day. The altcoin, which climbed to over $ 8.60 during the day, is trading at $ 8.28 at the time of writing this article and has gained 7.63% in the last 24 hours. This increase occurred despite the token experiencing a major token unlock of approximately $ 300 million on Thursday. However, TRUMP price has lost 89% of its value from its all-time high. *This is not investment advice.

Some investors’ confidence in XRP has waned due to the asset’s recent price swings. Recall that XRP plunged from $2 this month to a low of around $1.6 on April 7. A few days later, it rebounded to $2 and has remained within this territory over the past week. Bearish Case for XRP However, recent bearish predictions indicate that XRP could be preparing for a major dip. As previously reported, the XRP price chart signaled a rising wedge breakdown, suggesting that the asset might revisit its April 7 low at $1.6. In addition, there are concerns that the ongoing tariff war might wreak more havoc on financial markets, as observed on April 7. Amid this bearish analysis, many investors are considering selling XRP to save themselves from potential losses. Why Investors Should Keep Holding XRP However, Farina cautioned investors against making this move. He urged them not to sell their XRP, highlighting seven reasons why investors should continue holding. Ripple Lawsuit Nearing Conclusion First, he mentioned that the SEC v. Ripple lawsuit, which has impacted XRP's performance over the past few years, is nearing its conclusion. This is due to the parties reaching an agreement to resolve the multi-year lawsuit. As previously reported, the SEC agreed to accept a reduced fine of $50 million and discard the permanent injunction the court imposed on Ripple’s business. The SEC and Ripple jointly asked the court to pause the litigation for 60 days as an agreement is in place to drive the much-needed resolution. If the lawsuit concludes, it would end the regulatory uncertainty surrounding XRP, potentially attracting more investors to the coin. Multiple XRP ETFs Another reason why Farina encouraged investors to continue holding is the growing institutional interest in XRP. He emphasized that several asset managers have filed to launch spot XRP ETFs in the United States. It bears mentioning that these funds aim to give institutional and retail investors a regulated way to gain exposure to XRP’s price. Therefore, their potential approval could channel more inflows into the XRP ecosystem. Price Discovery Yet to Come Third, the expert noted that XRP’s true market price has not been established. This indicates that he believes XRP is trading below its true value due to regulatory challenges and other factors. As he expects the lawsuit to wrap up soon, and with more capital entering the ecosystem through ETFs, XRP might establish its true value. Regulatory Clarity on the Way The fourth reason Farina believes people should continue holding XRP is because he anticipates regulatory clarity for the broader crypto market. As regulators, particularly those in the U.S., provide clarity for crypto, it could motivate more investors to adopt top assets like XRP. In the meantime, the U.S. has taken key steps in providing clear and sensible regulations for the crypto market. As previously reported , the U.S. SEC clarified that meme coins and stablecoins like Ripple USD (RLUSD) are not securities. The country is also close to having a stablecoin regulation passed by the U.S. Congress, with the proposal awaiting a full vote from the lawmakers. Trump’s Pro-Crypto Stance Fifth, Farina highlighted U.S. President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance as further justification for holding XRP. A government that favors crypto could imply lighter regulation or the potential adoption of the emerging asset at the federal level. So far, the U.S. is already pushing to establish clearer and sensible regulations. It also plans to adopt cryptos like XRP as part of its reserve. RLUSD Is Just Getting Started For the sixth justification, Farina asserts that Ripple’s RLUSD is just getting started, meaning that the stablecoin is primed for more growth. Recall that major prime broker Hidden Road disclosed plans to utilize RLUSD as a collateral asset for its brokerage services, potentially using it to clear some portion of its $3 trillion annual trade. As the stablecoin registers high volumes, it could drive more demand for XRP as collateral and transaction fees. Upcoming Ripple PartnershipsLastly, the expert highlighted Ripple’s upcoming partnerships as another justification why investors should continue holding XRP. He suggested that Ripple is close to announcing new partnerships that could drive demand for XRP. Partnerships centered around XRP being used for cross-border settlements could potentially drive the coin’s demand to greater heights. These reasons all point to the fact that Farina expects greater demand for XRP, which could push its price to unprecedented levels. Therefore, he advised investors to continue holding XRP in order to participate in the upcoming rally.",Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-04-19 16:13:34

But 2025? Oh, it’s got that electric vibe. With blockchain giants like Near Protocol making headlines for onboarding record-breaking user numbers, and Internet Computer turning heads with its push toward full-stack decentralized apps, it’s safe to say this year’s lineup of high-utility coins isn’t playing around. Meanwhile, Qubetics has crept up from the shadows with numbers that even seasoned pros didn’t see coming. Its $TICS token has already raised more than $16.2 million in its ongoing crypto presale , selling over 508 million tokens to 24,900+ holders. That’s not just hype—that’s traction. And folks across North America are starting to notice. But what really sets Qubetics apart is that it’s actually solving the very problems other projects tiptoed around. Legacy coins often promised the stars but delivered half-baked decentralization, clunky interfaces, or features that didn’t scale. Qubetics, though? It’s fixing all of that with a toolkit built for pros, devs, and even your tech-curious cousin. This ain’t just another altcoin—it’s infrastructure for what’s coming next. Qubetics ($TICS) – The Real-World Crypto That’s Already Delivering If there’s one project to keep tabs on right now, it’s Qubetics. It’s more than a coin—it’s a whole operating system built to handle the next evolution of finance, ownership, and digital experience. And yes, it’s catching steam. Qubetics has built a Real World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace that’s straight-up game-changing. While other blockchains talk about DeFi and cross-chain swaps, Qubetics is out here making real estate, intellectual property, and even business equity tradable like ERC-20 tokens. This is the kind of shift that could unlock trillions in off-chain value. With over 508 million tokens sold and $16.2 million raised in its presale’s 30th stage, $TICS is making serious waves. Each token is priced at $0.1729 right now, and analysts are already comparing this phase to Ethereum’s $1 days. But what makes this project stand out? Here’s a breakdown of what Qubetics is bringing to the table: Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet: Built for businesses, freelancers, and power users. Manage assets across blockchains without giving up control. Decentralized VPN & Communications: No middlemen, no data leaks—just end-to-end privacy. QubeQode IDE: Allows developers to create and deploy dApps directly within the ecosystem. Real-World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace: Tokenize real-world stuff—homes, vehicles, business equity—in a few clicks. Presale Stats: 508M+ tokens sold, 24,900+ holders, $16.2M+ raised Current Price: $0.1729 per $TICS Analyst Projections: $TICS at $1 post-presale = 477% ROI $TICS at $5 = 2789% ROI $TICS at $15 post-mainnet = 8567% ROI North Americans looking for the Best Coins to Join Now won’t want to skip this one. It’s a first-mover in tokenizing everything from contracts to commodities. While the market zigs, Qubetics zags—and that makes it way more than just another altcoin. NEAR Protocol Advances in AI and DeFi Integration NEAR Protocol is making significant strides in integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and decentralized finance (DeFi) within its ecosystem. The launch of NEAR.AI’s research hub aims to develop a next-generation AI model with 1.4 trillion parameters, positioning NEAR at the forefront of AI innovation in blockchain technology. Additionally, NEAR’s DeFi sector is experiencing growth, with projects like Ref Finance and Aurora enhancing cross-chain liquidity and attracting Ethereum-based decentralized applications (DApps) to the NEAR ecosystem. These developments underscore NEAR’s commitment to expanding its technological capabilities and user base. ​ In the NFT and metaverse domains, NEAR is providing a robust platform for creators and developers. Platforms such as Mintbase are leveraging NEAR’s low transaction fees and high-speed processing to offer efficient NFT minting and trading experiences. Furthermore, NEAR’s focus on sustainability through its proof-of-stake consensus mechanism aligns with the growing demand for environmentally friendly blockchain solutions. These initiatives reflect NEAR Protocol’s dedication to fostering innovation while promoting sustainable practices in the blockchain industry. Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) – Redefining What a Blockchain Can Be Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) has unveiled its Year 4 roadmap, marking the third anniversary of its mainnet launch. This roadmap emphasizes the development of Decentralized Artificial Intelligence (DeAI), aiming to train and run AI models directly on-chain. Such an approach seeks to enhance transparency and user control, introducing innovations like AI models traded as NFTs and smart contracts capable of verifying Ethereum code. ​ Additionally, ICP’s roadmap introduces “chain fusion,” a strategy designed to enable direct interoperability with major blockchains such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana without intermediaries. This initiative addresses liquidity fragmentation and promotes a more unified blockchain ecosystem. The DFINITY Foundation, leading this development, envisions a future where decentralized blockchains become the dominant technology stack, supporting secure and unstoppable AI. Real World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace – What It Means and Why It Matters Okay, so what’s this “Real World Asset Tokenisation” thing Qubetics is flexing? Let’s break it down in plain English. It’s not just a buzzword—it’s the future of ownership. The idea is simple: take physical or off-chain assets—like your house, your startup, or even a royalty agreement—and turn them into digital tokens that can be traded, sold, or collateralized. Here’s what makes it huge: Liquidity for Illiquid Assets: Sell a fraction of your property or business without losing control. Accessible to All: Anyone with a smartphone and some $TICS can get in. Fractional Ownership: Own a piece of assets you never thought you could afford. Faster Settlement: No middlemen, banks, or paperwork delays. Global Reach: Tokenized assets can be traded worldwide in seconds. This isn’t some theoretical use case—it’s happening now. And Qubetics has built the rails to run it on. Conclusion: Time to Pick Your Ride Qubetics is solving real-world problems with a toolkit that’s already live and kicking. Near Protocol brings speed, sustainability, and a builder-first culture. ICP flips the script on cloud-based infrastructure by running everything on-chain. Whether you’re deep into Web3 or just crypto-curious, each of these projects offers something different. But Qubetics? It’s building the rails for a tokenized future that’s already unfolding. So if you’re looking for the Best Coins to Join Now , you’ve got your shortlist. Just don’t blink—this space moves fast.

First, Teucrium recently launched the 2X Long Daily XRP ETF or XXRP that has already attracted over $24 million in assets. Second, several companies, such as Grayscale, 21Shares, WisdomTree, Canary, and Franklin Templeton, have all applied for a spot fund. Most analysts believe that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will approve these ETFs. Polymarket odds indicate an approval rate of 77%. Third, President Donald Trump mentioned XRP as one of the tokens that will be part of the U.S. government’s strategic reserves. Such a move would likely increase demand for the coin. Furthermore, the SEC dropped its appeal of a case it had filed in 2020, thereby ending one of the longest-running legal issues in the cryptocurrency industry. The end of this lawsuit will help the company strike deals with American banks and money transfer companies.

It is still below the 50-day Exponential Moving Average and the descending trendline that connects the highest swings since December. XRP is forming a falling wedge pattern, a popular bullish reversal sign. This pattern features two descending and converging trendlines, often leading to a breakout when they converge. Therefore, the coin is expected to have a strong bullish breakout, with the initial target being $3.40, its highest level this year. A move above that resistance will signal further gains, potentially reaching $5. The bullish outlook will be invalidated if the price drops below this month’s low of $1.6110.

The Fed chair said there would be tension between the central bank’s twin mandates from Congress: maximum productive employment with minimum consumer price inflation. Meanwhile the New York Federal Reserve’s Treasury yield curve recession indicator gives a 56% chance of the US economy going into recession in July. Economic Fears Could Catalyze Bitcoin’s Trajectory to $1 Million In Q1, BlackRock’s crypto chief Robbie Mitchnick said while speaking with Yahoo Finance, “A recession would be a big catalyst for Bitcoin.” “It’s long liquidity, meaning it benefits from increased fiscal spending, deficit accumulation, and lower interest rates—all typical features of a recessionary environment,” Mitchnick said. The inflationary recession the US central bank fears may be the catalyst that launches Bitcoin to the stratospheric $1 million forecast Block and CashApp founder Jack Dorsey made for by 2030. Here are five ways markets expect that to happen: 1. There Are No Tariffs on Cryptocurrency There are no tariffs on Bitcoin. — Michael Saylor (@saylor) April 3, 2025 Unlike imported steel and manufactured items, there are no Trump Administration tariffs for Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies on the table. Bitcoin is an amorphous global Web3 layer network that exists in a borderless cyberspace. Javier Molina, market analyst for the eToro trading brokerage platform, said in mid-April: “Right now Tesla, Apple, and Google are showing more volatility than bitcoin, because that’s where the tariffs have a direct impact.” US import tariffs slow the exchange of dollar exports in exchange for foreign materials and manufactured goods. As a result, countries that import fewer dollars may opt to import Bitcoin instead. 2. National and Corporate BTC Stockpiles Race In fact, the US government’s own official stockpile plans have launched an international land grab for the scarce supply of remaining Bitcoin, capped at 21 million. Fortune Magazine reported on Thursday that Binance is in talks with several world powers to help them implement sovereign Bitcoin funds. Meanwhile, a Trump White House official even discussed an idea in April with Anthony Pompliano to use tariff revenue to buy Bitcoin for the US strategic national reserve. These shifts are tectonic in the scale of their implications for present market valuations. Following in the wake of US leadership and Strategy’s successes , corporate balance sheets and whale-sized BTC addresses began accumulating Bitcoin like never before in Q1. 3. Fed Rate Cuts God Candle Bitcoin’s Price Yes pic.twitter.com/m3wfn7802r — Simply Bitcoin (@SimplyBitcoinTV) April 18, 2025 Furthermore, if Trump’s trade war leads to a slowing economy and rising prices, keeping Powell occupied at the moment, it could be another tsunami for Bitcoin’s price, with entrenched support levels locked in at the historical factor of 10 times on a roughly 4-year market cycle. The financial crisis-era Fed rate cuts to nearly 0% in 2009 saw Bitcoin’s price move from $0.003 in 2010 to $469 in December 2015, when the central bank began raising rates again. The global asset price crash in 2020, followed by emergency rate cuts to 0% in May 2020, launched Bitcoin’s price again from $5,245 on Mar. 18, 2020, to $66,953 in Nov. 2021. Then, after pulling back for three months, Bitcoin immediately continued revising ruthlessly downward following the Fed’s pivot to rate hikes in Mar. 2022. That took markets to below $16,000 before the year was over. Later, as the Fed started trimming rates down again in September 2024, like clockwork, Bitcoin’s price rallied to historic record high levels. A slowing economy would likely prompt the printing press to target lower interest rates that ease lending to get businesses moving again. This has historically had the effect of pushing prices up for consumers, stock traders, and Bitcoin buyers. 4. US Fiscal Deficits Are Rocket Fuel For BTC The Congressional Budget Office expects the US yearly national deficit in tax revenue to cover spending to continue to grow from its current record proportions. The CBO also predicts the national debt will be 156% of GDP by 2055. There is a direct correlation since 1980 between US recessions and federal deficit spending rising to and becoming entrenched at new record high levels, according to data published by the St. Louis Federal Reserve. Washington deficit spending levels also historically trend with Bitcoin prices because the government hogs up credit markets, creating upward pressure on loan rates that brings on more of the Fed’s printing press to keep business flowing. 5. Easy Dollars Make Hard Bitcoin More Dear In Recessions Bitcoin’s world-historically disruptive growth as an independent Internet currency seems to exemplify the economic principle expressed by Gresham’s Law: “Bad money drives out good from circulation.” Thomas Gresham, who founded the Royal Exchange of the City of London in the 16th Century, noticed a pattern in the circulation of metal coins off the mint. During uncertain times, merchants would spend and deposit the coins that were easier to make, like copper and silver, but hoard the most difficult coins, like gold. International currency economists found the same pattern in free-floating global currency exchanges in the 20th century monetary era as central banks adjusted supplies and loan rates. While dollars are easy for the Fed to make as long as the economy has the capacity to grow production to cover its loans, BTC is very hard to make, but demand for it continues to grow. Bitcoin’s price was up 37% on the 12-month window the week ending Friday, Apr. 18. Meanwhile, the high-growth, tech-focused Nasdaq Composite was up 4.39% on a one-year basis.

Police outside Washington, D.C. say customers at Wells Fargo, Bank of America, PNC and other US banks living have lost approximately $100,000 to bank impostor scams this year alone. That’s in just one corner of the US – Prince George’s County, Maryland. Thieves are impersonating major lenders, sending texts about suspicious account activity to trick victims into replying or calling a fake number, reports NBC4 Washington. Victims are then instructed to withdraw money and deposit it into ATMs, or gift cards to “secure” their accounts. Police advise people to call their bank directly using the number on their card, visiting a branch in person and hang up if anyone urges you to move money. The FTC says such scams are on the rise, triggering $470 million in losses last year alone, commonly involving fake package deliveries, job offers and wrong number schemes. That number is five times higher than what was reported in 2020, although the number of overall reports declined. The FTC recommends forwarding suspicious texts to 7726 to report them.

In a recent market update, supported by a detailed 4-hour chart analysis, CasiTrades presented an Elliott Wave interpretation suggesting that XRP is nearing the conclusion of a Wave 2 corrective phase. According to the analyst, the conditions remain intact for a significant Wave 3 impulse move that could drive XRP to new highs within weeks. 🚨XRP Nearing the End of Wave 2: April Breakout Still in Play🚀 A lot of you are wondering about my April breakout prediction, and yes, I still believe it's on the table. I've stepped out to the 4H chart for a wider view, and from an Elliott Wave perspective, we're ending what… pic.twitter.com/3BqDRMn2wx — CasiTrades 🔥 (@CasiTrades) April 17, 2025 Key Support Zones: $1.90 and $1.55 in Focus From a broader technical perspective, CasiTrades emphasizes that not much has changed on the macro timeframe. The focus now rests on the completion of the corrective structure. XRP has demonstrated solid support at the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level around $1.90. However, the analyst notes that a deeper retracement to the 0.618 level at $1.55 remains the most statistically probable scenario for a corrective low. This zone, marked in green on the chart, is highlighted as the key area where a potential bottom could be established before a strong upward move resumes. $2.24: The Pivotal Resistance to Break CasiTrades identifies $2.24 — the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement — as a critical resistance level. A confirmed breakout above this line would invalidate the likelihood of revisiting lower supports such as $1.55 or $1.90. The analyst suggests that once XRP convincingly breaks and holds above $2.24, the market will shift decisively in favor of bullish continuation. Price action near this resistance will be key to confirming the next phase of the move. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Wave 3 Targets Project Significant Upside Regarding Elliott Wave theory, the analyst posits that XRP is concluding its Wave 2 correction. Whether the low is already in place or if one final test of support is required, CasiTrades maintains that a macro Wave 3 is imminent. The projected extension targets for Wave 3 are derived using standard Fibonacci extension metrics. CasiTrades outlines three key target zones: $6.50 (the 1.618 extension), $9.50 (the 2.618 extension), and $12+ (the 3.618 extension), with the latter two identified as increasingly likely scenarios depending on the strength of the move. Late April Remains a Viable Launch Window The assertion is grounded in classical Elliott Wave logic, which states that one of the impulse waves — typically Wave 3 — must extend. According to the update, if Wave 3 begins within the expected timeframe, the move to higher levels could unfold over weeks, not months. As of now, XRP is trading near $2.10, with relative strength index (RSI) values hovering around the midline, reflecting a neutral momentum state. Volume and price action in the coming days will be decisive, especially if XRP approaches the green support box or begins to test the $2.24 resistance zone once again. CasiTrades concludes that the correction is either complete or very near completion. With the chart reflecting potential for a rapid continuation, the late-April timeframe continues to align with the original breakout projection. The analyst reiterates that the setup is not based on speculative enthusiasm but on well-established Fibonacci retracement and extension frameworks coupled with Elliott Wave principles.

On Monday, the exchange announced that customers in New Jersey, Connecticut, Wyoming, Oklahoma, Idaho, Iowa, Rhode Island, Kentucky, Alabama and the District of Columbia could now trade 11,000 US-listed stocks and ETFs. Kraken notes those states represent the start of a “phased national rollout” for equities trading, with plans to expand to other states and then international markets like the United Kingdom, Europe and Australia. Then on Friday, the exchange announced it was launching FX perpetual futures on Kraken Derivatives. The first two offerings to launch are EUR/USD and GBP/USD, both with up to 20x leverage. Kraken notes that it already has a sizable presence in the FX spot market, with the exchange’s customers trading $5.4 billion in that sector this year so far, including $3.5 billion concentrated in the EUR/USD and GBP/USD pairs. Kraken’s new expansions come amid reports that the exchange is gearing up for an initial public offering (IPO) in the first quarter of 2026. Kraken also recently cleared some regulatory turbulence, announcing last month that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had agreed “in principle” to dismiss its lawsuit against the firm. The regulator charged the exchange in 2023 with operating its crypto trading platform as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, dealer, and clearing agency.

Amidst all that buzz, Ruvi AI is emerging as a game-changer. It’s the only one, so far, integrating blockchain technology and AI to solve real-world problems in a way that’s both practical and scalable. While Cardano’s developments get all the headlines, Ruvi AI’s innovative approach is quietly creating waves among investors and blockchain enthusiasts. That’s because Ruvi AI isn’t just redefining how blockchain and AI work together, it’s positioning itself as a powerful tool for businesses, creators and developers worldwide. Ruvi AI’s Revolutionary Blockchain-AI Fusion The thing that sets Ruvi AI apart from many other crypto projects is its focus on real-world problems. Its superapp delivers AI-powered tools to help with content creation, business process optimization and just about everything else. Usability is at the heart of Ruvi AI’s philosophy. Solutions have to be both accessible and scalable for a global audience. At the heart of Ruvi AI’s ecosystem is the $RUVI token . That token facilitates secure and transparent transactions across the platform. The token’s pricing structure shows its investment potential: right now, you can buy tokens at $0.01 during the presale phase. Once listed, the token will debut at $0.07. Analysts are forecasting a $1 valuation in the near future. Record-Breaking Presale Performance Ruvi AI’s presale has been a huge success. Within days of its launch, the platform sold over 10 million tokens, raising $100,000. That kind of investor confidence is a great sign for the platform’s potential. To make the presale even more attractive, Ruvi AI has implemented a VIP tier rewards system. For example, investors committing to 100,000 tokens at the current $0.01 price point are eligible for VIP Tier 3. That comes with a 60% bonus. In other words, they get an additional 60,000 tokens. At the confirmed listing price of $0.07, those tokens would be worth $11,200. At the anticipated $1 valuation, the value balloons to $160,000. Incentives for Top Investors Ruvi AI doesn’t just stop at tiered bonuses. Its leaderboard rewards program recognizes and rewards the most active contributors during the presale phase. The top ten investors will each receive 500,000 RUVI tokens. That’s a prize worth $500,000 if the token reaches its forecasted $1 valuation. Contributions by the top fifty and top 1,000 investors are also rewarded with 250,000 tokens ($250,000) and 20,000 tokens ($20,000) respectively. Looking to the Future Ruvi AI’s unique integration of blockchain and AI offers a distinct, long-term value proposition. While Cardano’s push into DeFi has generated excitement, Ruvi AI’s focus on usability and technological innovation positions it as a leader in the development of meaningful blockchain solutions. With the current $0.01 presale price, the confirmed $0.07 listing price and projected $1 valuation, Ruvi AI presents a compelling opportunity for investors. It’s not just about financial gains—it’s about being part of a project that’s shaping the future of blockchain technology. Now is the time to explore what Ruvi AI has to offer and secure a stake in that future.

Uniswap ( UNI ) price dropped to $5.26 on Saturday, down by over 72% from its highest point this year, and is hovering at its lowest level since Aug. 5. The decline is because of the ongoing sell-off in the crypto market as tensions on trade continued. It also happened as it lost market share to other popular decentralized exchanges like Raydium, Orca, and PancakeSwap. According to DeFi Llama, Uniswap has transacted over $48 billion in volume in the last 30 days. PancakeSwap processed $33.6 billion, while Raydium and Orca handled $11.3 billion and $13 billion, respectively. On the positive side, Unichain, its recently-launched layer-2 network, has continued to gain market share. Protocols in the network processed over $329 million in the last seven days, bringing its 30-day volume to $301 million. Unichain has overtaken other larger layer-1 and layer-2 network, including Core, Stacks, Internet Computer, Scroll, Algorand, and Injective.

Uniswap price analysis UNI price chart | Source: crypto.news Technicals suggest that UNI price may be on the verge of a bullish breakout in the near term. It has dropped to the support at $5.25, which coincides with the trendline that connects the lowest levels since 2022. Uniswap price has formed a giant megaphone pattern, a popular bullish sign. This pattern has two ascending and diverging trendlines. Therefore, the coin will likely have a strong bullish breakout in the coming months as bulls target last year’s high of $19.32, which is 275% above the current level. A drop below the lower side of the megaphone will invalidate the bullish view and point to a drop to $3.4, its lowest level in 2022.

A new report by crypto exchange Bitso revealed this, showing that 9% of all crypto purchases in the region in 2024 was XRP. This was more than the Ether (ETH), which was just 5%, and Solana (SOL) at 4% within the same period, showing that XRP is the most popular altcoin among crypto investors in the region. Bitso is one of the top crypto-focused financial service firms in the region, with nine million retail users across Argentina, Mexico, Colombia, and Brazil. The company based its report on the purchasing and holding behavior of individuals who used its platform in 2024 compared to 2023. Interestingly, interest in XRP appears to be very new. Data shows that the percentage of XRP in the average crypto investor portfolio increased from 0% in 2023 to 12% in 2024. The massive surge in interest is likely due to the rapid gains that XRP experienced from late 2023. Purchasing behavior among Bitso users (Source: Bitso) The altcoin has been struggling since the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Ripple over the status of XRP in late 2020. However, it has seen a resurgence in late 2023 after Donald Trump won the US presidential elections. In the aftermath of the elections, XRP rose more than 300% in value, reaching new highs for the first time in years. While it has now fallen to $2, XRP remains one of their fair performers year-to-date, with only a 10% decline year to date. This is similar to Bitcoin, which had a 9.56% decline and was far better than other major altcoins, such as ETH, which had a 52% decline, and SOL, which had a 28% drop. Stablecoins and Bitcoin remain dominant holdings in users’ portfolios While many users are aping XRP, stablecoins and Bitcoin remain the most held assets in users’ portfolios. According to Bitso data, Bitcoin dominated users’ portfolios, making up 49% of the average portfolio in 2024. However, this was a drop from 57% in 2023, mostly because of memecoins, altcoins, and fiat tokens gaining prominence in wallets. This is likely because BTC is also no longer the most purchased crypto asset by users, as it dropped from 28% in 2023 to 22% in 2024. In its place, Circle USDC is now the most purchased cryptocurrency with 24%, while Tether USDT is third with 15%. Stablecoins and local fiat currency holdings also grew due to several factors, including the yield offered by stablecoins, the devaluation of local currencies, and users diversifying their portfolios and taking profits. Crypto adoption growing in LATAM Meanwhile, the Bitso report also observed an increase in crypto adoption across the region, using registered users’ data in the four countries where it operates. In Argentina, its registered users increased by 11%, while that of Mexico went up by 13%. Brazil and Colombia saw 6% growth each. Unsurprisingly, most crypto adoption was from young people. People between 25 and 34 years old accounted for 38% of users. This was followed by people between 18 and 24 years old and those between 35 and 44 years old, with 23% each. It appears that the older people were, the less likely they were to use crypto, with those 65 years and older having the least percentage, at 2%. Interestingly, older age groups have seen an increase in their trading activity. Users 45 – 54 years old saw their trading increase from 13% to 14%, while that 55 – 64 years old also increased to 6% from 5%. However, 25 – 34 years remain most active, with 34% of trading activity despite the 3% decline. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

One such voice is Doctor Cat, a widely followed market analyst, who has set a minimum price target of $4.50 for XRP, calling it a “worst-case scenario.” “For everyone asking, although it should be clear already; $4.5 remains the minimum target for $XRP,” he tweeted on Tuesday. According to him, “assuming the worst-case scenario that indeed the bull run is over for Bitcoin,” and it only reaches a dead cat bounce around the mid-$80K range, XRP could still reach $4.50. This projection stems from a confluence of technical factors, including the XRP/BTC ratio and the 1.618 Fibonacci extension from the last drop, assuming the current bottom holds. The analyst, however, noted that a daily close below $1.69 on the 2-day Ichimoku cloud (Kumo) could invalidate the setup. But for now, he estimates a 50% chance that XRP has already bottomed, based on time cycle analysis. Meanwhile, analyst Egrag Crypto echoed the bullish outlook, stressing his “Kangaroo Pattern” and pointing to a historic Bullish Cross on the XRP/BTC chart involving the 55 EMA and 155 MA indicators. According to Egrag, the last time this bullish cross happened, in May 2017, XRP exploded by over 950%. A similar setup occurred again on February 17, 2025, which he believes could be the launchpad for a major rally. Using different Bitcoin price scenarios, he forecasted that if BTC hits $130K–$170K, XRP could soar to $22–$29. “I know what you’re thinking: after yesterday’s bloody day, and you’re still talking about double digits for XRP? My response to you is a resounding YES,” Egrag stated . However, not all indicators are rosy in the short term. Analysts at Glassnode issued a cautionary note , highlighting signs of vulnerability. Notably, during XRP’s February rally, its Realized Cap nearly doubled from $30.1 billion to $64.2 billion, largely driven by retail investors. But that momentum has cooled, and XRP’s Profit/Loss Ratio has been in steady decline since January. The analysts warned that this rapid influx of retail capital has led to a concentration of holders with elevated cost bases. “ With wealth concentrated in new hands, conditions appear increasingly top-heavy and vulnerable,” they noted. Elsewhere, technical analysts are closely watching the critical $2 resistance level, now seen as a pivotal threshold. A decisive breakout above this zone could invalidate a potential head-and-shoulders pattern and catalyze a full-scale bullish transition.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-19 17:06:38

A recent report from Bitso , a long-time partner of Ripple, shows that users in the region are buying and holding more XRP than ever before. The digital currency is gaining traction compared to popular assets like Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Dogecoin (DOGE) in the region. Even though overall trading activity on the Bitso platform dropped in 2024, XRP has rebounded. XRP Leads Among Top Altcoins In 2024, Bitso users across Latin America showed a strong preference for XRP, which, according to the report, accounted for 9% of all crypto purchases on the platform. In comparison, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin saw trading activity levels of 5%, 4%, and 2%, respectively. Even the memecoin PEPE had only 6%. This means more users chose to buy XRP over other well-known digital currencies. Bitcoin and Stablecoins Still on Top While XRP saw a huge boost in interest, Bitcoin and stablecoins remained the most traded assets on Bitso. Bitcoin (BTC) attracted 22% of all purchases last year, although that number dropped from 28% in the first quarter of the year. Meanwhile, stablecoins led the charts with 39% of trading activity, showing a strong demand for dollar-pegged tokens. Nevertheless, XRP was not far behind, showing its growing importance in the region. Mexico Leads the XRP Surge Mexico had the highest number of XRP buyers among all Latin American countries. The report says 10% of all crypto purchases from the region went into XRP, which shows that Mexican users are leading the way in XRP adoption. The report also shows XRP amongst others is becoming a major part of user portfolios . In 2023, XRP was not part of the average user’s crypto portfolio. However, by the end of 2024, it accounted for 13% of users’ holdings. This means users are buying XRP and holding the asset for the long term. XRP’s momentum on Bitso shows that users in Latin American regions are adopting digital assets in addition to popular currencies like Bitcoin. If this trend continues, XRP could become one of the top digital assets in the region. Interestingly, the approval of an XRP Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) could help make the asset more popular. With an ETF, investors can put money into XRP without buying or storing the token directly. This could attract more people and big investors to the XRP market.

43537880,https://zycrypto.com/?p=105077,1745082922,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,Wallet Holding Bitcoin Since $284 Price Awakens After 10 Years,https://zycrypto.com/wallet-holding-bitcoin-since-284-price-awakens-after-10-years/,"A Bitcoin wallet that had remained dormant for an entire decade has suddenly sprung to life, according to blockchain tracking platform Lookonchain. In a tweet on Tuesday, the firm revealed that the wallet moved all 365 BTC, currently valued at around $29 million, after 10 years of complete inactivity. Notably, the wallet initially received the Bitcoin when the price was just $284 per coin, placing the original investment at approximately $103,000. This reactivation has raised eyebrows in the crypto community, particularly as it’s not an isolated incident. On March 24, a wallet created back in August 2011, when Bitcoin was trading at just $13, moved 100 BTC, now worth over $7.7 million, to new addresses after nearly 14 years of silence. Just a day later, another whale made waves by moving 3,000 BTC, originally acquired in 2017. The stash had grown from a $12.29 million valuation to over $260 million, a staggering 2,115% increase. These funds, believed to be linked to old Coinbase-related transactions, had remained untouched for eight years. Earlier on January 10, Lookonchain reported yet another dormant whale awakening. This time, 500 BTC, valued at $46.87 million, was transferred to Coinbase Prime. The BTC was received initially six years ago, when the price hovered around $7,000. While it’s unclear why these long-inactive wallets are suddenly becoming active, analysts suggest several possible motives, including internal fund reallocation or even precautionary moves due to compromised private keys. However, the timing is notable as Bitcoin struggles to hold its ground, with some analysts pointing to profit-taking activities. Notably, crypto analytics firm CryptoQuant reported on April 3 that 1,057 BTC, aged between 7 and 10 years, had recently moved. “1,057 Bitcoin that hadn’t moved in 7–10 years just woke up. Long-term holders may be preparing to sell,” the firm tweeted . Further, analyst Maartunn from the firm pointed out that the Spent Output Age Bands indicator had crossed the 50 threshold, a signal typically associated with long-term holders starting to sell. The timing coincided with market anxiety stemming from geopolitical tensions and concerns about U.S. trade policy. Notably, despite aggressive institutional accumulation earlier in the year , with firms like Tether, MicroStrategy , and Metaplanet purchasing a combined 91,781 BTC , the market remains under pressure. Bitcoin has dropped over 28% from its all-time high despite this influx, with analysts attributing the weakness to heavy selling by longtime holders and ETF outflows totaling around $4.8 billion. Currently, despite a spirited recovery effort on Wednesday, the market remains volatile, with key support emerging in the $80,000 level. At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $84,896, reflecting a 0.51% surge over the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-19 17:15:22

While some chase headlines, others build infrastructure, solve real-life pain points, and stack up long-term relevance. That’s where the spotlight belongs—on platforms bridging utility and adoption with enough upside to catch the attention of both first-timers and seasoned participants. In the hunt for the most potential crypto, three names are gaining traction across Latin American communities and beyond: Qubetics, Filecoin, and Theta. One is powering tokenized real-world assets, another secures decentralized storage, and the third is reshaping video streaming through blockchain. And right now, it’s Qubetics that’s making waves—not just for what it promises, but for what it’s already delivering. Qubetics (TICS): Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace with Unmatched ROI Potential Qubetics is coming in strong with one of the most practical use cases in crypto: Real World Asset Tokenization. This isn’t theoretical stuff—it’s about transforming real estate, invoices, contracts, and even commodities into on-chain assets that can be tracked, traded, shared, and settled without borders or middlemen. A coffee distributor in Colombia can tokenize bulk shipment contracts, track delivery progress via smart contracts, and split ownership with partners through programmable tokens. A property owner in Mexico can digitize land rights and allow fractionalized ownership on the Qubetics blockchain, opening up access to backers across the globe. This is Web3 meeting the real world—minus the hype, plus the clarity. The Qubetics Marketplace is built for professionals, not just techies. Lawyers, accountants, consultants, and enterprises can plug into the framework without needing to write code. Every tokenized asset comes with built-in compliance layers, making it audit-ready and legally binding in many jurisdictions. That makes it appealing not just to crypto-native users but also to traditional businesses exploring blockchain entry points. That’s the kind of value that makes Qubetics the most potential crypto for 2025. It isn’t just promising innovation—it’s delivering tools that users and professionals can rely on in daily operations. Qubetics Presale: Performance and Price Forecasts Now, here’s where things really turn up. The Qubetics presale is currently in its 30th stage. So far, it’s sold 508 million $TICS tokens, attracted over 24,900 token holders, and raised a staggering $16.2 million—all while maintaining a steady token price of $0.1729. Those who entered in stage 1 at $0.01? They’re sitting on a 1629% return already. And even now, participants joining at $0.1729 still have a big runway ahead. Analyst forecasts suggest that at $1, buyers today could see a 477% ROI. A move to $5 unlocks 2789%. At $6 or $10, 3367% and 5678%, respectively. If it rockets to $15 post-mainnet, the potential ROI crosses 8567%. The presale window hasn’t closed. Access is still open—but this late-stage entry won’t last forever. The price is climbing, traction is real, and momentum is hard to ignore. For those still on the fence, this isn’t just a chance—it’s the kind of strategic entry point that doesn’t come around often. Qubetics offers real-world utility, a clean user interface, and serious ROI potential backed by ongoing adoption. It leads this shortlist as the best crypto presale because it’s actually solving problems people deal with every day—and doing it in a way that invites growth. Filecoin: The Backbone of Decentralized Storage Filecoin is no newcomer. It’s been one of the most consistent and respected names in the blockchain ecosystem, thanks to its mission of decentralizing cloud storage. Built by Protocol Labs, Filecoin allows anyone with extra disk space to rent it out, creating a network of peer-to-peer data storage that’s secure, efficient, and censorship-resistant. Instead of relying on centralized servers owned by tech giants, users can store their files across a distributed system of independent nodes. This is particularly valuable for content creators, developers, and businesses who want to ensure that their data remains intact, verifiable, and always accessible—without being at the mercy of traditional data centers. In Latin America, Filecoin’s decentralized model has been embraced by media creators, local journalists, and open-source developers who need long-term content preservation at a fair price. NFT platforms are also using Filecoin to store artwork metadata, keeping digital assets alive even if frontend websites vanish. Its ecosystem is deeply rooted in the Web3 movement, powering everything from data availability layers to decentralized archives. Filecoin remains a go-to tool for devs looking to build permanent, resilient apps—especially those centered on ownership and authenticity. Filecoin is one of the most potential crypto projects due to its established tech, real-world applications, and continued community support. It’s not just storage—it’s infrastructure for the future of the open web. Theta: Reimagining Video Streaming Through Blockchain Theta is doing to video what Ethereum did to contracts—giving it a decentralized backbone. Known for powering a blockchain-based streaming network, Theta enables users to share bandwidth and resources to improve content delivery and cut down costs. It flips the traditional content delivery model. Instead of relying on centralized servers to host and stream content, Theta leverages a peer-to-peer network. Viewers can earn rewards (in the form of TFUEL) by offering up unused internet bandwidth, creating a system where people get paid for simply watching and sharing content. That’s a big win in regions where bandwidth costs are high and infrastructure is uneven. Content creators in cities like Bogotá or Lima can reduce their hosting costs. Gamers in São Paulo can stream with fewer hiccups. And event broadcasters can scale content to wider audiences without breaking the bank. Theta has also inked partnerships with major names like Samsung, Sony, and Google Cloud. Its enterprise-grade approach, mixed with its strong crypto-native architecture, makes it attractive to both Web2 giants and Web3 pioneers. The result? A hybrid streaming model that supports NFTs, premium subscriptions, and interactive metaverse experiences. Theta secures its spot as one of the most potential crypto projects by merging blockchain incentives with real-world entertainment. It’s making video delivery cheaper, smarter, and more user-focused—and that’s a game-changer. Final Thoughts Finding the most potential crypto isn’t about picking the loudest name. It’s about spotting the project that delivers—on utility, access, community strength, and upside. Qubetics, Filecoin, and Theta all bring something to the table. Filecoin handles decentralized storage with precision. Theta reinvents how video gets delivered. But Qubetics? It’s hitting that sweet spot of usability, innovation, and financial reward. Between its Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace and its explosive presale momentum, Qubetics is capturing attention across global and Latin American crypto circles. It’s already changing how businesses operate and how value moves across borders. And the presale isn’t over yet. For those watching from the sidelines, there’s still a shot to jump in at $0.1729 before the next wave hits. This isn’t a maybe—it’s a strategic move for those who see what’s coming.

It’s a place where innovation meets tradition; this fusion is evident in every aspect of life, including entertainment. While gambling is generally frowned upon in the UAE due to religious reasons, the advent of online crypto casinos has opened a new avenue for residents and tourists alike. These platforms offer a discreet, secure, and highly engaging gambling experience, all from the comfort of your home or luxurious Dubai hotel room. Enthusiasts of online casino gaming in the UAE are experiencing a golden era. The market is flooded with top-notch digital platforms that are secure and eager to accommodate your gaming needs. What’s more, several of these platforms even allow you to place bets in dirham and offer Arabic language support, making the gaming experience incredibly user-friendly for residents of the Emirates. In this article, we aim to equip you with all the essential information you’ll need to engage with real-money online casinos in the UAE fully. We’ll discuss the inception of crypto casinos in Dubai, their legality, and the best casinos to explore online in Dubai. From highlighting the premier platforms where you can wager real money to detailing the variety of games available and the most enticing promotional offers, we’ve got you covered. Crypto gambling in Dubai: Legality The history of gambling in the UAE is fascinating. It is rooted in longstanding Arab gaming traditions that predate the advent of contemporary casinos. Camel racing, for instance, evolved from a modest pastime to a major spectator sport over the years. Sheikh Zayed was instrumental in this evolution, initially funding car racing in the 1970s and establishing horse racing tracks in the 1990s. High-end hotels once hosted gaming parlors until legislative changes in 1998 curtailed them. It’s crucial to understand that the UAE’s legal framework is heavily influenced by Islam, its official religion, which prohibits conventional gambling as well as crypto-based casinos. Both federal and local laws reflect this prohibition, and promoting gambling is equally forbidden. The 2012 amendments to gambling laws further tightened restrictions on online gambling, leading to the blocking of multiple casino websites in 2017. Despite these constraints, a clandestine gambling culture persists, with a limited number of offshore crypto casinos catering to UAE players. The UAE Penal Code stipulates that public gambling or gambling in a designated house can result in detention or a two-year prison sentence. For those interested in online gambling, the safest route is through verified and trusted offshore online casinos, and we can guide you to the most secure options. Interestingly, the UAE is quite receptive to blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. However, since March 2022, Dubai has emerged as a new focal point in the crypto world following the UAE’s introduction of the world’s inaugural standalone crypto regulatory body, the Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority. Industry giants like Binance co-founders Changpeng “CZ” Zhao and He Yi have relocated to Dubai, while Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong has engaged with its regulatory officials. Additionally, Wazirx, one of India’s leading exchanges, is shifting its headquarters to the city. This aligns with Dubai’s ambitious strategy to ascend into the ranks of global financial powerhouses like New York, London, and Hong Kong. Over the years, Dubai has cultivated its reputation as a hub for business and financial services in the Middle East, largely due to its proactive embrace of innovation. This is especially apparent in its calculated and intentional approach to crypto, which has propelled it to become the third-highest country in global crypto adoption, surpassing Hong Kong and the USA. The current landscape The UAE is not one to lag in technological advancements or global trends. Known for its booming tourism industry, the country has caught the eye of international casino operators. A notable development occurred earlier this year when Ras al-Khaimah, one of the seven emirates, announced plans to consider legalizing gaming in certain resorts. This announcement coincided with Wynn Resorts expressing interest in constructing a gambling-approved resort. This isn’t the first instance of a major international casino brand showing interest in the UAE. MGM has previously announced multiple collaborations with UAE-based companies. What sets the Wynn Resorts proposal apart is its explicit intention to include a designated gaming area, essentially a casino, in its plans. In a move to potentially boost tourism, the UAE has established a new regulatory body, the General Commercial Gaming Regulatory Authority (GCGRA), to oversee commercial gaming. Comprising U.S. casino and gambling experts, the GCGRA aims to develop a national lottery and commercial gaming framework. This is a significant step, given that gambling is currently illegal in the UAE. Getting started with crypto gambling Before entering crypto casinos in the UAE, it’s essential to have a strong grasp of cryptocurrency fundamentals. Numerous online resources can explain how crypto functions, equipping you with the knowledge needed to buy and sell digital assets effectively. Next, it’s crucial to identify a reputable crypto exchange that supports the specific cryptocurrencies you’re interested in trading. A reliable exchange will facilitate smooth transactions for buying and selling crypto. Given the many options available, thorough research is imperative before settling on an exchange. Additionally, it’s advisable to read customer reviews and compare pricing structures before creating an account on any crypto casino platform. Factors to consider when selecting a crypto casino in the UAE When it comes to picking a crypto casino, there are several key aspects you should weigh to make an informed decision. Here’s a rundown of what to keep in mind: Security and licensing Security is paramount in any online casino, but it has added significance in crypto casinos. When it comes to gambling in the UAE, your safety, privacy, and anonymity should be top priorities, especially given that online gambling is illegal in the country. Therefore, engaging in crypto gambling only through trustworthy platforms is crucial. In evaluating crypto casinos, we scrutinize their licensing credentials to ensure reputable international authorities accredit them. The UK Gambling Commission, Malta Gaming Authority, and the Curacao eGaming Control Board are among the most credible international licensing agencies. We thoroughly vet all crypto casinos that accept UAE players to confirm they hold valid licenses. Additionally, we look for robust security features, such as SSL encryption and stringent data protection policies, to ensure your safety. Payment options The available payment options should be a key consideration when searching for the top crypto casino in the UAE. Your funds should be securely managed, free from the risks of hacking or loss. We endorse only those Dubai-based casinos that provide secure payment methods backed by stringent security protocols. Additionally, given that crypto casinos are not legal in the UAE, it’s crucial to avoid linking your bank account directly to the gambling platform. We recommend crypto casinos that enable efficient deposits and withdrawals through your cryptocurrency wallets. This approach allows you to legally transfer your winnings from your crypto wallet to your bank account. Slots and games at Crypto Casinos When selecting crypto casinos in the UAE, a crucial aspect to weigh is the range and quality of games and slots. This encompasses several elements, such as the total number of games, the variety within those games, and the integrity of the software, ensuring fair play. We endorse only those casino platforms that feature an appealing array of games, live dealer options, and slots. Regarding slot machines, our recommendations are limited to crypto casinos that boast an extensive collection of slots and table games. Additionally, these casinos should employ provably fair technology to guarantee that each slot machine spin is fair and random. This gives you a genuine opportunity to win, free from manipulative practices. Promotional offers Many crypto casinos in the UAE entice players with appealing bonuses and promotions. Examine these incentives carefully, as they could be a valuable way to augment your funds. Customer support Customer service is a vital component of any crypto casino. Whether you need assistance for basic tasks like navigating the platform or urgent matters like resolving withdrawal issues, timely customer support is crucial. In our evaluation of crypto casinos, we strongly emphasize the responsiveness of their customer support teams. They should be accessible through various channels, including live chat, ticketing systems, and email, and should ideally respond within a 24-hour timeframe. Moreover, we prefer Dubai-based crypto casinos that offer customer support in both Arabic and English. Terms of service Always read the terms and conditions meticulously before signing up. Crypto casinos often have complex rules and limitations, and being well-informed helps you navigate potential risks. For instance, some platforms may require you to wager your earnings multiple times before withdrawal, while others may restrict certain payment methods. By considering these factors, you’ll be better equipped to find a crypto casino that best suits your needs.

Nashville, Tennessee-based Canary Capital filed to list an ETF on Friday that holds the Tron blockchain network’s native token, TRX, which will include staking capabilities. Canary Files For Staked TRX ETF Canary submitted an S-1 registration statement for the Canary Staked TRX ETF with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As the name suggests, the fund seeks to hold spot TRX and stake a portion of the tokens via one or more staking infrastructure providers. The staking feature would allow investors to earn extra yield on their investment. Finally seeing something that makes sense on the SEC website — TRX ETF LFG!!! https://t.co/DQlI35izRV — H.E. Justin Sun (@justinsuntron) April 19, 2025 A proposed ticker symbol as well as the management fee for the fund will be revealed at a later date. Since 2024, Canary Capital has filed for a number of other altcoin ETFs, including funds that, if approved, would give investors exposure to Litecoin (LTC), Ripple’s XRP , Hedera (HBAR), and Pengu (PENGU). The appeal of crypto ETFs has been that they give traditional investors exposure to an asset without requiring them to buy and store it themselves. TRX was recently trading at $0.2423, down slightly over the past 24 hours, according to data provider CoinGecko. With a market capitalization of $23 billion, it’s the ninth-largest cryptocurrency. Dozens Of Altcoin ETFs The US Securities and Exchange Commission authorized ETFs holding Bitcoin and Ether to list in the US in 2024, but has not yet approved any other altcoin ETFs. Since U.S. President Donald Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20, the Securities and Exchange Commission has acknowledged dozens of new altcoin ETF filings. Proposed ETFs include funds holding native layer-1 tokens such as Solana and SUI, as well as meme tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Official Trump (TRUMP). President Trump has said he wants America to become the world’s crypto capital and has appointed pro-crypto leaders to key regulatory agencies, including the SEC. The flurry of altcoin ETF applications reflects issuers’ growing efforts to address demand for crypto investment products. Kaiko recently suggested that an XRP-based fund was the next most likely to secure the SEC’s sign-off. Still, the regulator has yet to approve a staking component in a crypto ETF, and on Monday, the regulator postponed a decision on a proposed rule change that would enable Grayscale’s spot ETH funds to engage in staking on Ethereum.",Cryptocurrency|News|Tron News|TRX,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRX,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-19 17:27:08

Currently trading at $125, analysts are eyeing a move toward $200 if momentum holds. At the same time, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is riding its own wave, with investor interest climbing thanks to its unique DeFi lending model. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining serious momentum as its Phase 4 presale pushes past $6.9 million in funding, backed by more than 8,400 investors. Currently priced at $0.025, the token is set for a 20% increase in Phase 5, where it will rise to $0.03. Early backers in this round could see up to 140% returns once the token reaches its projected launch price of $0.06. As SOL shows signs of another major breakout, MUTM is quietly emerging as the low-cap coin that could outpace even the giants this bull cycle. Mutuum Finance: A Shooting Star in DeFi Innovation Mutuum Finance is quickly becoming one of the leading names in decentralized finance (DeFi), thanks to its groundbreaking dual-lending platform. Blending Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models in an innovative manner, the platform has attracted significant interest. Over 8,400 investors have so far backed the project, raising over $6.9 million in presale, reflecting a high degree of confidence and interest. As conducted in Phase 4 of presale, the MUTM token now stands at $0.025, yet a 20% price action is expected on its way into Phase 5. This is an early-bird chance to achieve spectacular profit before hitting the estimated launch level of $0.06. As another means of enhancing participation and fostering loyalty, Mutuum Finance recently launched an effective new dashboard. Among the features that make it appealing is an online leaderboard where the top 50 highest-ranked token holders are displayed in real-time. The highest-ranking players will receive special bonus tokens to hold for longer term and actively engage in. The Power of Bi-Lending: P2C Coupled with P2P The core of Mutuum Finance’s innovation lies in its hybrid model of lending. The P2C structure allows users to collect passive income through contributing USDT to liquidity pools that are driven by smart contracts. In contrast, the P2P layer eliminates intermediaries and allows users to lend to each other directly, providing greater privacy and control. By integrating these two systems, the platform achieves a golden balance between decentralization, security, and efficiency, rendering it highly appealing to both cautious and militant DeFi investors. Community Incentives & Referral Rewards Mutuum Finance is also strengthening its community with robust incentive programs. A current $100,000 sweepstakes program has $10,000 in MUTM tokens awarded to ten lucky participants. Referral incentives are also in place for current users to bring in new investors, fostering growth through grassroots support. Early adopters are also privy to special privileges such as VIP access to upper-tier staking pools, vote power for governance, and line-one updates on the platform, each meant to reward long-holding. Intelligent Tokenomics for Long-Term Appreciation Mutuum Finance’s carefully designed tokenomics framework provides price stability and long-term growth. In combination with native deflationary forces and limited token circulation during presale, the platform induces scarcity and maximizes value. Its staking mechanism adds another incentive, pushing users to hold and helping to maintain a healthy ecosystem. Both Solana (SOL) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) show strong growth potential. SOL is eyeing a move toward $200, while MUTM has raised over $6.9 million from 8,400+ investors, with a price increase to $0.03 coming soon. Its innovative lending model and solid tokenomics offer promising returns. Early investors in MUTM could see up to 140% gains. Don’t miss this opportunity, get involved now and position yourself for success.

Two key momentum indicators, RSI and MACD support a bullish thesis in Solana. The green histogram bars above the neutral line and RSI sloping upwards with a reading of 56 suggest an underlying positive momentum in SOL price uptrend. Solana could rally 13.33% and test the $152.90 level, a key resistance and previously a key support for the altcoin. If Solana successfully flips the $152.90 level from resistance to support, a rally towards resistance at $180, a sticky resistance for the altcoin throughout March and the first two weeks of April 2025.

This resistance level is highlighted on the weekly BTC.D candlestick timeframe chart. Each time the dominance taps this descending trendline, it struggles to break through and eventually tumbles. Notably, Bitcoin’s dominance is now back around this resistance, and a technical outlook posted on the TradingView platform points to a crash to 40% within the next months. Bitcoin Dominance Could Crash To 40%: Good For The Altcoin Market The dynamics behind Bitcoin’s dominance have been different this cycle compared to previous ones. This is because the dominance has grown massively since the beginning of this cycle, leaving little room for an altcoin season like many have continued to expect. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s market dominance is sitting at a yearly high of 63.2%, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Related Reading: Solana Price Enters Consolidation Trend Above $130 That Could End In A Breakout However, an interesting technical analysis shows that the Bitcoin dominance is now tapping on a resistance trendline that puts it at risk of crashing below 40%, up until 34.9%. If that pattern holds true once again, the crypto market could be approaching a phase where Ethereum, XRP, and other altcoins regain strength in what many hope will be the next altseason. A drop in Bitcoin dominance will bode positively for altcoins, since it indicates that the altcoin market is outperforming Bitcoin. This will be characterized by a widespread increase in the prices of major altcoins, such as Ethereum, Solana, and XRP. In such a case, tokens like Ethereum, XRP, Cardano, Chainlink, BNB, and Litecoin, the so-called DINO coins that have survived multiple market cycles, are most likely to draw early attention from retail traders. However, unlike past bull runs, when only a few hundred altcoins existed and most received some attention, the crypto market is now saturated with thousands of altcoins. After the large market-cap altcoins, the rotation could move toward more niche sectors. Sectors such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Real World Assets (RWA), and DeFi may also attract attention, but even within these categories, a strong filtering process will be applied to select the altcoins that will perform better. Can Bitcoin Dominance Really Crash To 40%? The Bitcoin dominance crashing to 40% is not a new phenomenon, looking at how the 2017 and 2021 bull markets unfolded. However, such a phenomenon happening again is becoming increasingly difficult, considering Bitcoin’s position in the investment world today through Spot Bitcoin ETFs. These funds in these ETFs are locked up for the long term, meaning a rejection in BTC dominance may not automatically result in massive liquidity flows into the altcoin market, as seen in 2021 and 2017. Related Reading: Cardano Price Surge To $1.7: Here Are The Factors To Drive The Recovery Even if Bitcoin dominance crashes toward 40% and ushers in a new altcoin cycle, many altcoins will eventually end in brutal drawdowns. Across past market cycles, the majority of altcoins have suffered losses of over 90% once bullish sentiment fades and capital flows back into stablecoins.

This ambitious forecast comes amid growing optimism surrounding regulatory clarity and the token’s expanding use cases in global finance. According to a Tuesday report , Standard Chartered envisions a steady upward trajectory for XRP, projecting milestones of $5.50 by the end of 2025, $8 by the end of 2026, $10.40 by the end of 2027, and ultimately $12.50 by the end of 2028. Notably, the bank attributed XRP’s sixfold increase following Trump’s November election victory to market expectations that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would abandon its legal challenges against Ripple, as well as speculation surrounding potential XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) approvals. The report suggested these gains are sustainable not only due to anticipated leadership changes at the SEC but also because of XRP’s fundamental utility . “XRP is uniquely positioned at the heart of one of the fastest-growing use cases for digital assets – facilitation of cross-border and cross-currency payments,” stated analysts from the bank. The bank further highlighted similarities between the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and popular stablecoins like Tether, noting that both enable blockchain-powered financial transactions that conventional banking institutions traditionally handle. “XRPL is similar to the main use case for stablecoins such as Tether: blockchain-enabled financial transactions that have traditionally been done through traditional financial (TradFi) institutions,” wrote Geoffrey Kendrick, head of digital assets research at the bank. Notably, the bank predicts a tenfold increase in stablecoin transactions in the next four years. Meanwhile, despite the optimistic long-term outlook, technical indicators suggest XRP faces near-term challenges. Earlier this week, the token breached $2.00, a crucial psychological support level. This breakdown has completed a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern, potentially signaling further downside pressure. Additionally, XRP is currently trading below its 21-day exponential moving average (EMA) of approximately $2.20, which now acts as resistance after multiple failed attempts to reclaim this level. On the other hand, the relative strength index (RSI) has declined into negative territory, hovering near 30—an indication that selling pressure currently outweighs buying interest in the market. That said, if Standard Chartered’s predictions materialize, XRP would experience more than a 500% increase from current levels by 2028. At the time of writing, the crypto asset was trading at $2.07, representing a 1.34% surge over the past 24 hours.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-19 17:32:07

In an interview with Cointelegraph, Ferrick identified signs of regulatory capture including, a public-to-private sector revolving door of employees, the same roster of attendees at regulatory events, and special treatment given to certain crypto projects. However, Ferrick added: ""The reason why I am not worried today is that a lot of what you're seeing from the regulatory side, like the SEC, for example, is totally open, public, and there are available opportunities to have conversations with the regulators about changing or thinking about the regulatory structures."" ""[The SEC] has a public portal where you can just submit written commentary on your thoughts for the crypto regulatory environment, and you can schedule meetings with them,"" the attorney continued.

Straten stated that when Bitcoin first reached the $10,000 level, he thought that reaching $100,000 would cause great chaos on a global scale, but such a situation did not occur. “When Bitcoin first reached $10,000, $100,000, I thought the world would be thrown into chaos due to liquidity and inflation pressures. But nobody cared,” Straten said, adding that gold’s doubling in 18 months to $3,300 similarly did not resonate with the public.

According to the company's data, wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 BTC, that is, Bitcoin's key holders, hold 67.77% of the total supply.

The announcement, made via HashKey Capital’s official account on X, underscores a significant advancement in the accessibility of regulated investment vehicles centered on XRP, the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. This latest initiative marks HashKey Capital’s third digital asset tracker fund, following similar offerings for Bitcoin and Ethereum. The XRP Tracker Fund aims to mirror the market performance of XRP and is tailored specifically for professional investors seeking a regulated means of entering the XRP market. In what is considered a strategic first in Asia, the fund allows monthly subscriptions and redemptions through cash and in-kind contributions. HashKey Capital is launching Asia’s first XRP Tracker Fund—with @Ripple as an early investor. This marks a major step in expanding institutional access to XRP, the third-largest token by market cap. 🧵👇 — HashKey Capital (@HashKey_Capital) April 18, 2025 Ripple Participation and Strategic Expansion A key element of this launch is the involvement of Ripple as an early investor in the fund. Ripple’s role as a seeding participant in the fund reflects an expanding partnership with HashKey Capital. The collaboration between the two firms extends beyond this initial product, including plans to jointly develop additional blockchain-based investment products and decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions for cross-border applications. According to HashKey Capital, both companies are also exploring the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) on the XRP Ledger. Among the potential developments under review is the launch of a money market fund (MMF) directly on the XRP Ledger, signaling a growing interest in integrating traditional financial instruments within blockchain ecosystems. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Institutional Recognition of XRP’s Role in Payments The rationale for choosing XRP as the focus of this new tracker fund is grounded in the token’s established position in the cross-border payments sector . XRP is widely recognized for enabling more efficient, faster, and less costly transactions than conventional international payment systems such as SWIFT. In addition to its payments use case, XRP and the XRP Ledger have increasingly been employed for the tokenization of RWAs and enterprise blockchain deployments. By creating a product that removes many of the technical and regulatory complexities associated with direct digital asset holdings, HashKey Capital is positioning the XRP Tracker Fund as a gateway for institutional participants to enter the digital asset space via XRP. Potential for Future ETF Conversion The fund may also serve as a foundation for more expansive offerings in the future. HashKey Capital indicated that, subject to regulatory approval, the XRP Tracker Fund could evolve into an exchange-traded fund (ETF) within the next one to two years. Such a development would likely further accelerate institutional adoption of XRP by offering enhanced liquidity and broader market participation. The launch of the XRP Tracker Fund by HashKey Capital, with Ripple as an anchor investor, represents a deliberate and strategic push to bring more institutional capital into the XRP ecosystem. With plans to explore additional investment vehicles and tokenization efforts, both companies are aligning their long-term objectives around regulated digital asset access. For investors interested in participating, HashKey Capital has made the fund available for monthly entry and exit, and inquiries can be directed to liquidfunds@hashkey.com.

The Board of Commissioners in Cook County, Illinois has approved a program that will send $1,000 payments to selected households battling elevated property taxes amid a “substantial increase” in tax bills in recent years. The Cook County Homeowner Relief Fund’s application process is expected to be launched in the summer. “In order to be eligible, households must have an income at or below 100 percent of the Area Median Income for their respective household size. Under these guidelines, for example, a four-person household making $119,900 or less would be eligible. Applicants must have also seen their property tax bill increase by at least 50 percent in any year since the 2021 tax year.” The program, known as the Cook County Homeowner Relief Fund, has a total budget of $15 million. The homeowner relief fund, however, would reportedly cost $1.4 million to run, leaving $13.6 million to be distributed. Public hearings were held with property owners beginning in September of 2024, before the approval of the Cook County Homeowner Relief Fund. According to Commissioner Bridget Gainer, the problem of ballooning property taxes in the Illinois county is severe. “Property taxes are rising faster than homeowners’ ability to pay, forcing people to leave neighborhoods they love and undermining the best ability to build wealth – home ownership.” The president of the Cook County Board, Toni Preckwinkle, says offering one-time payments to help in paying property taxes is, however, a stopgap measure while the leadership pursues a long-term solution.

Right now, the total market cap for stablecoins is about $230 billion, and most of that is backed by short-term government debt like T-bills. Geoff Kendrick, a London-based analyst at StanChart, said this kind of legal clarity would be the thing that flips the switch. His numbers show a $400 billion per year surge in demand for T-bills over four years — that’s the full span of a second Trump term. And that much buying could soak up all of the new short-term debt the government plans to issue in that period. “Rising demand for USD-denominated stablecoin reserves would create additional demand for USD,” Kendrick said in his research note. New bills will get eaten by stablecoin reserves Kendrick said these inflows won’t just be a side effect. This would make stablecoins the biggest buyer group for U.S. Treasurys, period. He said even foreign buyers after Covid didn’t hit that level, and they were spreading their demand across T-bills, notes, and bonds. In contrast, stablecoins are laser-focused on short-term debt, because it fits their structure — it’s safe, it’s dollar-based, and it gives them liquidity without locking up capital too long. “The industry could well account for the largest buying flow of any sector across all U.S. Treasuries,” Kendrick wrote in a 9-page report last Tuesday. This matters because stablecoin issuers use Treasury bills as reserves. It’s not a preference — it’s a necessity. These crypto tokens need backing that matches their promise of being “stable.” Most are pegged to the U.S. dollar, and the only way to back that promise without relying on junk is by parking money into short-term government debt. And that demand helps the dollar hold its ground globally. Kendrick said this kind of move could offset current threats to dollar dominance, especially those coming from tariffs and growing trade tensions that have put pressure on the greenback’s value. “It should further entrench USD dominance of stablecoins, which is likely to be sticky given strong network effects in digital assets,” Kendrick said. Stablecoins aren’t new, but what’s changing is their growth speed and the regulatory momentum behind them. Their market cap has already jumped 11% this year, and about 47% over the past 12 months, with Tether and USD Coin still holding the top spots. The GENIUS Act, cleared by the Senate Banking Committee in March, and the STABLE Act, passed by the House Financial Services Committee earlier this month, are the two bills that matter here. Both are focused specifically on stablecoin regulation. The bet is that if Trump returns and signs them into law, the legal fog lifts, and big players start scaling fast. “If stablecoins make the USD even easier to use, demand for USD assets to back stablecoins is likely to increase,” Kendrick said. “The strength of network effects in digital assets suggests that USD dominance, once cemented further, will be difficult to usurp,” he wrote. “The holy grail of international finance is finding an alternative to the USD that offers the same flexibility and liquidity as the USD.” But ironically, Kendrick’s report shows stablecoin growth might just make the dollar even more dominant. The deeper these assets dig into DeFi and payments, the more USD reserves they’ll need. And as long as most of them are backed by T-bills, they’ll keep feeding that short-term debt machine.

Among those weighing in is crypto analyst Arthur, who contends that despite the acquisition’s potential to deepen Ripple’s access to traditional finance (TradFi), it does not signal a forthcoming partnership with SWIFT. Ripple’s Strategic Direction Remains Unchanged According to Arthur , Ripple’s objective has been to present a more efficient and transparent alternative to SWIFT. The company’s technological offerings have consistently positioned it as a challenger to existing financial messaging systems rather than a potential collaborator. For this reason, the notion that Ripple may seek to integrate with SWIFT contradicts the company’s foundational mission. Ripple is NOT going to integrate with SWIFT even with the Hidden Road acquisition. Why ? Let’s break it down 🧵👇 pic.twitter.com/ZPb34yOZpW — Arthur (@XrpArthur) April 18, 2025 Arthur argues that the acquisition of Hidden Road aligns with Ripple’s original goal: modernizing cross-border financial infrastructure without depending on existing systems. In his view, Ripple’s strategy remains focused on building independent pathways for institutional finance, rather than integrating into legacy frameworks such as SWIFT. This aligns with a recent statement by Ripple CTO, David Schwartz, who stated that Ripple’s goal is to build a payment network like SWIFT, powered by decentralized, open technology with XRP at its core, to enable seamless, low-cost money movement. Expanding Institutional Access Through Hidden Road Analysts view Ripple’s acquisition of Hidden Road as a strategic step to expand its presence in institutional finance. Hidden Road provides services including clearing, foreign exchange, custody, and prime brokerage, core components of traditional financial operations. With this acquisition, Ripple can directly connect with institutional clients and infrastructure, potentially bypassing intermediaries like SWIFT. He emphasizes that this development should be interpreted not as a step toward collaboration with traditional payment systems, but as a move to establish Ripple’s independent financial network. He suggests that Ripple is offering traditional institutions the opportunity to adopt blockchain-native solutions on its platform, without requiring a bridge through legacy institutions.

He argues that the system has become associated with centralization and political leverage, particularly through its role in enforcing financial sanctions. According to him, this makes SWIFT less appealing to emerging markets and institutions looking for neutral, censorship-resistant platforms. Shifting Power Dynamics in Global Finance According to Arthur, Ripple’s strategy focuses on building infrastructure that prompts traditional finance to adopt modern solutions, rather than conforming to the existing system. With offerings in liquidity, compliance, and custody built on blockchain technology, Ripple is establishing itself as a self-sufficient, institution-friendly alternative. While there has been community speculation around XRP potentially gaining a portion of SWIFT’s transaction volume—sometimes used to justify ambitious price targets—Arthur cautions against assuming any formal integration will occur. To date, Ripple has not made any announcements supporting the idea of a direct partnership with SWIFT. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Here’s What’s on The Line,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-approaches-key-technical-milestone-heres-whats-on-the-line/,"XRP may be nearing a significant bullish breakout as technical indicators suggest the potential for a golden cross formation, a development closely monitored by market participants. This trend reversal pattern is often viewed as a strong signal of upward momentum, prompting speculation about a renewed rally in XRP’s price. Golden Cross Formation May Signal Impending Price Rally Recent technical analysis reveals that XRP’s short-term moving average is about to cross above its long-term moving average. This formation, known as a golden cross, is widely interpreted as a bullish indicator suggesting a potential shift from a consolidation phase to a sustained uptrend. XRP’s price has not returned to its all-time high above $3 since January 2025. Currently, the cryptocurrency is trading at $2.07 , representing a 0.68% increase over the past 24 hours. Despite these short-term metrics, the upcoming golden cross has raised optimism among investors and analysts who view it as a possible precursor to renewed momentum. Should the pattern be confirmed, XRP could challenge key resistance levels. The $2.60 mark is identified as a critical threshold, and surpassing it may place the asset on track to revisit the $3 level. Institutional Developments Strengthen Market Outlook In parallel with technical developments, market dynamics on the institutional front are also evolving in favor of XRP. HashKey Capital, a major investment firm in the digital asset space, has launched a tracker fund focused on XRP in the Asian market. This move positions the token alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum as one of the only cryptocurrencies currently featured in HashKey’s institutional investment products. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The firm’s decision to create a dedicated XRP fund is based on the asset’s utility in facilitating cross-border transactions. XRP’s payment infrastructure has been recognized for its efficiency and cost-effectiveness when compared to traditional systems, making it a strong candidate for wider adoption by financial institutions. Meanwhile, in the U.S., expectations for the approval of XRP-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) remain high. Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store, has stated that there are no valid grounds for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to continue delaying or denying XRP ETF applications. He expressed confidence that approval is likely shortly, as the regulatory environment gradually becomes more accommodating. The digital asset is currently positioned at a pivotal moment, with both technical indicators and institutional interest aligning to create favorable conditions for a potential breakout. While market volatility remains a concern, the formation of a golden cross and the entrance of new institutional players may serve as catalysts for XRP’s next major price movement.

His analysis suggests that Bitcoin could reach as high as $138,000 within 90 days — provided current macroeconomic trends hold. Statistical Edge for Bitcoin Bulls Peterson’s latest forecast is rooted in a data-driven look at the U.S. High Yield Index Effective Yield, which is currently above 8%. Based on historical data, this level of yield has coincided with positive Bitcoin performance more often than not. “This has happened 38 times since 2010 (monthly data),” he explained. “3 months later: Bitcoin was up 71% of the time. The median gain was +31%. If it went lower, the worst loss was -16%.” With these odds favoring the bulls, Peterson outlined a potential BTC price range between $75,000 and $138,000 over the next three months. Strong Floor, Bullish Ceiling Peterson’s models, including his proprietary “Lowest Price Forward” tool, continue to suggest solid support for Bitcoin even in the face of market volatility. Earlier this year, he gave 95% odds that Bitcoin would not fall below $69,000 in March. For Bitcoin to hit the upper end of his new forecast, it would require a 62% rally from current levels. While ambitious, the projection is not out of reach if the macroeconomic environment remains favorable. Unusual Correlation With the U.S. Dollar In a notable shift, Bitcoin has shown a rare positive correlation with the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), diverging from its historical pattern. Peterson attributes this anomaly to shared responses to broader economic stressors. “This level of BTC-USD correlation is unprecedented. The relationship is not causal, but reflective of underlying conditions affecting both,” he said. He further explained that in 2024, Bitcoin and the dollar began reacting similarly to factors like tightening liquidity, elevated real interest rates, and global risk aversion. However, he believes this alignment is temporary. “BTC will decouple and rise when real yields drop + liquidity returns,” Peterson predicted. Dollar Weakness Could Fuel the Next Rally Recent data shows the DXY holding below the critical 100 threshold — one of its weakest points in the last three years. This decline in dollar strength may offer Bitcoin a tailwind, mirroring conditions during the early 2023 bull run. While macroeconomic uncertainty continues, analysts like Peterson remain optimistic that Bitcoin could capitalize on the current environment, potentially ushering in a new phase of growth.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-04-19 18:28:30

ADA, currently trading at $0.60, is eyeing a breakout toward the $1 mark, backed by network upgrades and growing adoption. Ethereum (ETH), holding strong at $1,577, is targeting $3,500 as momentum builds around staking and its expanding DeFi ecosystem. But it’s Mutuum Finance (MUTM), priced at just $0.025, that’s turning heads, offering a fresh, high-upside opportunity with early-stage potential and a dual-lending protocol that’s gaining serious traction. For investors weighing risk vs reward, MUTM might just be the most explosive pick going into summer. Mutuum Finance Presale Gains Momentum in Phase 4 Mutuum Finance is currently in Phase 4 of its presale, offering tokens at $0.025. Investor enthusiasm remains strong, with the project surpassing $6.9 million in funding and attracting over 8,400 participants so far. As the presale progresses into Phase 5, the token price is set to rise by 20% to $0.03, giving current buyers a strategic advantage. In addition to growing investor interest, Mutuum Finance has introduced a new dashboard feature with a real-time leaderboard that highlights the top 50 token holders. Those who remain on the leaderboard will qualify for exclusive bonus token rewards, adding a gamified layer to early participation and long-term holding incentives. Redefining DeFi Lending with a Hybrid Model Mutuum Finance is changing the game of decentralized finance by blending the strengths of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models. With the P2C model, users have the ability to stake stablecoins like USDT in liquidity pools fueled by smart contracts to receive passive earnings while speeding up access to capital for borrowers. On the other hand, the P2P model eliminates intermediaries so lenders and borrowers can conduct direct and private negotiations. This hybrid model ensures greater security, efficiency, and decentralization, giving users complete autonomy over their monetary strategies. Whether risk-averse investors seeking secure returns or high-yield seekers seeking greater freedom and control, Mutuum Finance creates an open, inclusive, and user-centric DeFi model. Creating a Safe and Stable Monetary System Security is inextricably integrated within Mutuum Finance’s design. The platform offers a fully collateralized Ethereum-backed USD-pegged stablecoin to offer long-term stability and avoid volatility that is characteristic of algorithmic schemes. Regular smart contract audits and offering financial transparency build trust among users and counter usual weak points for DeFi protocols. Under this setup, Mutuum Finance offers a practical and trustworthy option for serious long-term investors. Spurring Imminent Adoption through Plentiful Incentives Mutuum Finance spurs imminent adoption through plentiful incentives. Ten lucky winners of a $100,000 contest will each win $10,000 in MUTM tokens. The referral program also allows users to win a bonus for inviting others into the ecosystem. Early adopters enjoy special benefits like access to new staking features, governance privileges, and a voice in platform development down the road. These incentives are community-driven and meant not only to bring people in but to retain them as well and keep them participating in the project’s expansion. A Vision for Sustainability Underpinned by Intelligent Tokenomics Mutuum Finance has created a long-term, strategic tokenomics strategy based on scarcity, stability, and investor retention. Split controlled presale allocations, simultaneous staking rewards, and anti-inflation features work to construct a stable supply of tokens as well as stimulate ecosystem expansion. While Cardano (ADA) and Ethereum (ETH) target solid gains, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers the highest upside potential. With its innovative dual-lending model and over $6.9 million raised, MUTM is poised for significant growth. As the presale moves into Phase 5, early investors can expect a 140% ROI. For those seeking explosive potential, MUTM could be the top pick heading into summer.

On April 17, Vietnam’s Ministry of Finance announced that it is working on a plan to test a local crypto exchange. This is part of a larger effort to create clear rules for digital assets in the country. The announcement was made during a meeting in Hanoi between Finance Minister Nguyen Van Thang and Ben Zhou, the co-founder of Bybit, a global crypto exchange. Vietnam’s Crypto Growth Calls for Control According to Minister Thang, Vietnam ranks third in the world in terms of the number of crypto users. Many people in the country trade digital assets, but no official rules govern these activities. He warned that without clear laws, people could lose money to crypto scams or unsafe platforms . He emphasized that the authorities alone cannot manage the growing crypto interest in the country. So, a legal framework for management is necessary to ensure the legitimate rights of investors. The Ministry of Finance wants to test a pilot crypto exchange before making final laws. This will help the government understand the risks and see what works best for the country. Bybit Offers Support and Experience to Vietnam’s Course Bybit’s Ben Zhou said the crypto exchange is ready to support Vietnam in pilot exchange-building. He offered help in staff training, risk control, exchange operations, and legal guidance. He said Bybit has experience keeping investor funds safe and running a transparent platform. Zhou also mentioned a recent $1.53 billion cyberattack on Bybit . He confirmed that all affected users were fully paid back and that the market was not harmed. He said this was possible because of Bybit’s transparency and strict 1:1 asset backing. Beyond Crypto Exchange Move: Vietnam Plans to Lead 2025 Blockchain Push During the meeting, Zhou called Vietnam a hub for growing blockchain technology innovations. He praised the country’s tech talent and strong interest in crypto. In 2022, the Government of Vietnam took a significant step in becoming a regional leader in blockchain technology. As reported, the country’s Deputy Prime Minister, Minister Ho Duc Phoc, signed and issued the National Blockchain Strategy into the national framework. This important decision aims to make Vietnam a leader in blockchain technology by 2025 , with long-term plans reaching up to 2030. Vietnam’s plan shows that the country is taking serious steps to safely and legally manage crypto, protect its people, and grow its economy. If approved, this pilot could set the stage for a safe, open, and growing crypto market in the country.

In February, hackers looted nearly $1.5 billion worth of Ethereum ( ETH ) and Lido Staked Ether ( stETH ) from Bybit in the largest crypto theft ever and possibly the biggest heist in world history. The blockchain research firm Elliptic, pseudonymous on-chain investigator ZachXBT and other researchers pinned the exploit on the Lazarus Group, a prolific North Korean cybercriminal outfit known for numerous high-profile hacks on major crypto platforms. Elliptic also said that Lazarus used eXch as part of its process to launder the stolen crypto. The exchange denied the money-laundering allegations, though it did cop to processing an “insignificant” portion of the stolen Bybit funds. This week, eXch took to the BitcoinTalk forum to announce it was shutting down on May 1st, claiming that “friends” in the state intelligence sector confirmed the exchange is the target of an “active transatlantic operation.” “Even though we have been able to operate despite some failed attempts to shut down our infrastructure (attempts that have also been confirmed to be part of this operation), we don’t see any point in operating in a hostile environment where we are the target of SIGINT (Signals Intelligence) simply because some people misinterpret our goals. Starting from the date of the merger with a new management team this month, and as a result of some urgent meetings, the majority of us voted to cease and retreat instead of going against strong winds, because none of us want to cause any harm to innocent people or this forum.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

While it’s been on a gradual decline overall, its price movement in April has started to draw some attention. Is EOS a good investment? When could it start climbing again? Find out in our EOS price prediction. Table of Contents What is EOS? EOS crypto price prediction: general outlook EOS price prediction 2025 EOS price prediction 2030 What is EOS? EOS is a blockchain platform designed for building dApps of any scale. Often dubbed the “ Ethereum killer” by fans, EOS offers similar functionality but with greater scalability, zero transaction fees, and a unique on-chain governance model. At the heart of EOS is the Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism — first introduced by Dan Larimer in 2013 for his BitShares project. DPoS is often described as a form of “digital democracy.” Unlike traditional PoS, DPoS separates network participants into block producers and voters. In short, not every token holder directly participates in block creation — instead, they vote for representatives to do so on their behalf.

The platform’s source code is open and available on GitHub, allowing community members to submit pull requests — though the final say rests with Block.one. EOS runs on its native token, also called EOS , which users can either buy or lease. This token gives them access to the network’s bandwidth, computing power, and storage — as well as the ability to vote on governance decisions. What’s on the horizon for the EOS crypto? Let’s take a closer look at the EOS price prediction. EOS crypto price prediction: general outlook At last check on April 19, EOS is trading at $0.627, up 0.5% over the past 24 hours. Over the past week, however, the coin slipped by 0.6%. Looking at the bigger picture, EOS is down roughly 14% over the past year. That said, EOS has seen some brief rallies. On Dec. 6, 2024 — during Bitcoin’s record-breaking surge — EOS spiked to $1.37 before beginning to decline again. In early April, it climbed once more, briefly reaching $0.87. For context, EOS’s ATH is $22.89, which it hit in 2018. Since then, its value has dropped by nearly 100%. EOS 1-day chart, April 2025 | Source: crypto.news In April, EOS’s price is primarily influenced by overall market sentiment, Bitcoin’s performance, and developments within the EOS ecosystem. Recent price movement has been modest, with occasional short-lived spikes. The future of EOS depends on greater adoption, continued development, and its ability to position itself as a scalable platform for decentralized apps. While the coin has potential, it remains volatile and far below its all-time high, meaning any recovery will likely take time and broader market support. Now, let’s turn our attention to the EOS coin price prediction for 2025. EOS price prediction 2025 According to CoinCodex’s EOS price prediction, there’s cautious optimism for the short term, with the coin potentially reaching $0.67 by May 17. However, their technical analysis shows more negative signals, with 23 indicators pointing bearish compared to just 9 bullish ones. The analytical site suggests that EOS could fluctuate between $0.535 and $0.737 annually. DigitalCoinPric’s EOS price forecast is much more upbeat, predicting that EOS could rise to $1.37 in 2025. In comparison, WalletInvestor offers a much more measured EOS price prediction, estimating the coin will reach a maximum of $0.141 by the end of the year. Will EOS go up or down in five years? EOS price prediction 2030 According to DigitalCoinPrice’s EOS price prediction for 2030, token’s price could trade between $2.96 and $3.43 by the end of the decade. CoinCodex’s projections for EOS indicate a less significant leap in value, estimating the token could range from $0.23 to $0.96.

According to Wallet Investor’s expectations, EOS could trade at a maximum price of just $0.163 by April 2030. Should you invest in EOS? Thanks to its scalable infrastructure and unique governance model, EOS still holds potential, but it’s a long way from its former highs. If you’re looking for a low-volatility crypto with room for long-term growth — and are comfortable with the risks — EOS might be worth watching. However, it may not suit short-term investors expecting quick returns. Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

This inactivity suggests that the altcoin is yet to recover from its uninspiring run in the first quarter of 2025. With the way the LINK price is currently set up, the altcoin does not seem likely to witness a lot of action in the short term. However, a prominent crypto analyst on X has identified important levels that could be pivotal in the future trajectory of the Chainlink price. Where Is LINK’s Next Major Resistance? Popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez took to the X platform to offer on-chain insights into the current setup of the Chainlink price. While the LINK price continues to move within the $12 – $13 consolidation range at the moment, certain on-chain levels could be critical to its long-term journey. Related Reading: Solana Price Enters Consolidation Trend Above $130 That Could End In A Breakout This analysis is based on the average cost basis of several Chainlink investors. For context, cost-basis analysis evaluates the capacity of a level to serve as support or resistance, depending on the total amount of coins last acquired by investors at that price level. As observed in the chart above, the size of the circle represents the amount of LINK tokens purchased within each price region and its corresponding strength. The bigger the dot, the higher the number of tokens, and the stronger the support or resistance; the green dots refer to support as they are beneath the current price, while the red dots refer to resistance as they are above the current price. Data from IntoTheBlock shows that the Chainlink price has key support around the $12.28 – $12.62 region, where 11,130 addresses purchased 26.55 million LINK tokens (worth $331.07 million at an average price of $12.47). This region would act as an on-chain support, as investors with their cost basis around the level would likely defend their positions by buying more tokens, thereby cushioning the LINK price. Martinez added that the altcoin faces major resistance around the $14.19 – $14.58 zone, where 20,930 investors acquired 21.19 million LINK tokens (worth $304.5 million at an average price of $14.37). Investors who bought tokens around this level are likely to sell if the Chainlink price returns around their cost basis, which would dampen the token’s bullish momentum and probably halt its upward movement. As mentioned earlier, these support and resistance levels could be pivotal to LINK’s trajectory over the next few weeks. Specifically, losing the $12.28 support could see LINK fall below $11, as there is no significant cushion beneath it. Chainlink Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of LINK stands at around $12.58, reflecting a mere 1% jump in the past 24 hours.

Peterson analyzed Bitcoin’s past performance after High Yield interest rates in the US rose above 8%. According to Peterson, similar interest rate levels have been observed 38 times since 2010. In the three-month periods following these periods, Bitcoin increased by 71%. The median gain in these periods was calculated as 31%, while the biggest loss was limited to 16%. According to the economist, these data indicate that Bitcoin could trade in the range of $75,000 to $138,000 in the next 90 days. Related News: Senior Analyst Claims Bitcoin Price “Could Go Much Higher,” Predicts What Would Happen in This Scenario Peterson also stated that the correlation between Bitcoin and the US Dollar has reached unprecedented levels in history. Emphasizing that this relationship is not causal, but reflects macroeconomic conditions affecting both assets, Peterson stated that this correlation has changed direction as of 2024. Bitcoin and High Yield interest rates, which previously moved in opposite directions, are now responding to the same economic stress factors: tightening liquidity, high real interest rates, and global risk aversion. At the end of his assessment, Peterson predicted that Bitcoin would break out of this correlation and rise again as real interest rates fall and liquidity returns to the markets. *This is not investment advice.

Glassnode data signals STH capitulation as losses hit historically significant levels. Market bottoms often followed STH losses breaching this critical profitability level. Bitcoin’s Short-Term Holders (STHs) face their biggest paper losses since past bear markets due to recent price drops. Glassnode data shows these holders are down ~$30,000 for every 1% Bitcoin falls – echoing historical market bottoms and capitulation events, which goes on to show that many recent Bitcoin buyers are underwater. Historically, this situation often triggers panic selling and sharp market swings, making traders question if this is a deep correction or the start of a reversal. How Are Long-Term Bitcoin Holders Doing? Long-Term Holders (LTHs), holding Bitcoin over 155 days, generally remain profitable with minimal paper losses now.

43542369,https://timestabloid.com/?p=64511,1745091121,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP Bull Flag Breakout Attempt: A Technical Blueprint to $40,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-bull-flag-breakout-attempt-a-technical-blueprint-to-40/,"If XRP breakout from its current bull flag to upside, it will reshape its market trajectory. After rising from under $0.90 to $2.70 in late 2024, XRP entered a tight, downward-sloping channel (marking the start of a classic bull flag). This consolidation spanned from January through April 2025. If this breakout is confirmed, it will trigger a strong bullish continuation, laying the groundwork for the next projected moves. The breakout won’t be random or speculative. It will follow a clean, precise technical pattern. The flag is symmetrical, the consolidation is clear, and the breakout would be confirming with volume. This is a signal and not a guess. Timing Is Everything The strength of this bull flag lies not just in its structure but in its timing. XRP rallied for weeks, then consolidated for exactly three months before attempting a breakout. This rhythm rally, pause, and continuation establishes a framework. If repeated, it provides a timeline to forecast future phases. This measured cadence shows the market building momentum in structured phases. Each pause resets the trend without reversing it, suggesting XRP isn’t spiking from hype but rising with discipline. The Second Flag Begins Following the approach of April breakout attempt, XRP is likely to enter its second bull flag. If the first consolidation lasted three months, we can expect the second to form and also unfold between May and July 2025. During this period, XRP could trade within a defined range—likely between $5 and $8. This flag, like the first, may form with tightening price action, declining volume, and multiple resistance tests. These traits signal compression-energy coiling before a move. If the pattern repeats, the next breakout could arrive in early August, potentially lifting XRP to $15. Pattern Recognition Fuels Projection The second flag is more than a repeat – it’s a continuation in a growing sequence. If XRP respects the established rhythm, the breakout structure should mirror the first: gradually narrowing price action followed by a sharp surge. The key level to watch is the upper boundary-likely near $8. A high-volume move through this level would confirm the second breakout. If confirmed, the next price target of $15 becomes more than possible—it becomes probable. Looking Ahead: The Third Flag Setup If XRP hits $15 by August, the third bull flag would likely begin forming between September and October. Following the same timing model, it would mature over three months, leading to another breakout in December 2025 or January 2026. This third phase could see XRP climb from $15 to $35 or even $40. Each breakout thus far has delivered nearly a threefold return from the base of the previous flag. If the cycle holds, the third breakout would likely follow suit. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Technical Cycles, Not Guesswork What makes this projection credible is not speculation, it’s structure. Bull flags are established continuation patterns. When they appear in sequence, each forming cleanly and breaking with volume, they reflect a healthy, trending market. The predictability of XRP’s current cycle is rare. Most assets don’t move with this kind of structural discipline. That makes XRP’s setup uniquely strong and gives traders a framework to anticipate moves instead of chasing them. $40 Isn’t a Fantasy—It’s a Measured Target With one flag completed, XRP appears to be progressing through a calculated bullish cycle. If the structure holds, the second breakout could target $15, and the third could propel it to $35 or $40. These aren’t wild predictions—they’re grounded in repeating technical patterns. The market is moving with precision, and XRP’s roadmap is becoming clearer with each breakout. Disclaimer: This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

While XRP continues to trade within modest price ranges, some market commentators believe that the asset holds the potential for significant price growth given the right circumstances. XRP’s Potential Valuation Linked to SWIFT Transaction Volume Remi Relief, a well-known figure within the XRP ecosystem, recently suggested that the digital asset could reach a value of $1,200 before the end of the year. His prediction is based on the assumption that the token could process a portion of the annual transaction volume currently handled by SWIFT, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication. SWIFT facilitates about $5 trillion in daily financial messaging services, which amounts to an estimated $1.25 quadrillion per year. Relief argues that even a small share of this volume could significantly raise XRP’s market value . He further claims that such growth could occur even without the assistance of emerging financial instruments such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), derivatives, or asset tokenization. However, achieving the $1,200 mark from the current price of approximately $2.13 would require a price increase exceeding 56,000%. Critics have called this projection highly speculative and unlikely. Analyst Alex Caraco has publicly dismissed such targets, citing practical and regulatory hurdles that would limit XRP’s ability to compete with established financial infrastructure at such a scale. Supporting Views with More Conservative Estimates Other analysts have issued similar projections with more tempered expectations. In September 2024, a crypto market researcher known as Crypto Tank noted that if XRP captured 10% of SWIFT’s daily volume, its price could climb to $100. Another analyst, Levi Rietveld, estimated in October last year that XRP could reach $60 if it processed 5% of that volume. Rietveld emphasized the asset’s faster transaction times, reduced costs, and reliability compared to traditional cross-border payment systems. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Developments That Could Influence XRP’s Trajectory Beyond integration into global payment networks, ongoing developments in the ETF space could also serve as potential growth catalysts. Several investment firms , including 21Shares, Canary Capital, and Grayscale, have filed proposals with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to introduce XRP-focused ETFs. The SEC has delayed its decision on these applications, with a revised review timeline set for May 2025. In addition, Franklin Templeton has entered the market with its own XRP ETF application. Legal analysts believe the outcome of Ripple Labs’ legal dispute with the SEC will heavily influence the prospects of ETF approval. According to Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan, institutional investors have shown increasing interest in XRP as a portfolio asset. Furthermore, the current U.S. administration’s positive stance toward cryptocurrency regulation has heightened expectations of more favorable conditions for ETF approvals. This has led asset managers to expand their ETF filings to include a wider range of altcoins, with XRP being among the top contenders. Although the $1,200 target for XRP appears unrealistic in the near term, discussions around its future remain positive. While some projections are ambitious, growing institutional interest, potential ETF approvals, and comparative advantages in transaction efficiency continue to position the asset as a noteworthy player in the digital finance sector.

Despite Ethereum being a highly secure and widely used blockchain, the report warns that Solana and BNB Smart Chain are gaining ground in decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes and fees due to faster speeds and lower costs. Scalability and Usability Improvements Binance attributes this trend to Ethereum’s current limitations, including high fees, slower transaction speeds, and a fragmented ecosystem of developers and liquidity. The rise of Layer 2 (L2) networks has also partly contributed to reduced value capture at its base layer, further weakening the network’s overall position. The Pectra upgrade, now scheduled for May 2025 after delays in testnet deployment, is expected to deliver core improvements that could ease these challenges. It merges the Prague execution layer with the Electra consensus layer and incorporates 11 Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs). Among these is EIP-7251, which increases the maximum effective staking balance from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH, helping to manage the load of over one million active validators. EIP-7691 will expand blob capacity, allowing more data to be posted to the mainnet while keeping costs low. EIP-7702 introduces account abstraction, enabling externally owned accounts to function more like smart contract wallets while offering features such as bundled transactions and gas sponsorship. The updates are designed to increase scalability and usability, potentially making Ethereum more practical for high-volume crypto payment use cases. However, Binance notes that none of these code changes directly aim to strengthen its monetary narrative or improve its censorship resistance. Fusaka, scheduled for late 2025, will also enhance Ethereum’s scalability. It introduces PeerDAS via EIP-7594, a key step toward full danksharding, which is crucial for improving the blockchain’s data availability. Additionally, the Ethereum Object Format will simplify smart contract creation while reducing execution overhead and providing developers with a safer and more efficient experience. Data Availability and ETH’s Value Concerns Despite these developments, Binance points out that Ethereum’s role as a data availability layer remains under competitive pressure from platforms like Celestia, EigenDA, and NearDA, which currently outperform it in raw throughput and cost. While Ethereum offers superior security, concerns persist about its ability to sustain ETH value accrual as it relies more on L2s. The research also notes that proposed solutions, such as repricing the blob market or requiring L2s to contribute fees, are uncertain, and the factor is also not prioritized in the ecosystem’s roadmap.

Our goal is to do that in the next 12 months, and we are on a great path to be able to do that.” The Schwab CEO's comments reflect the growing trend of traditional financial (TradFi) institutions adopting crypto products and offering services that blur the line between the digital asset world and TradFi.

As market sentiment shifts, SHIB’s community-driven momentum could propel it back to higher valuations. Meanwhile, a new challenger is making waves in the DeFi sector, Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Currently in Phase 4 of its presale, MUTM tokens are available at $0.025 each. As this phase concludes, the price is set to rise to $0.03 in Phase 5. Since launch, the project has attracted over 8,400 investors and secured $6.9 million in funding. The Mutuum Finance team has just introduced a new dashboard featuring a leaderboard that highlights the top 50 holders, who will earn bonus tokens for maintaining their position in the top 50. Mutuum Finance: Shaping the Next Generation of DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance attracts major investor interest through its unique method of decentralized financing. Users can benefit from the combined Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) framework which creates a dual-lending system that provides users with adaptive control together with improved efficiency. The lending process in P2C is managed by smart contracts which accept USDT in liquidity pools while providing loan backing through ETH. The P2P model gives users complete control over their loan management which provides increased privacy alongside self-directed autonomy. Mutuum Finance provides a high-yield DeFi platform through its adaptive operations alongside liquidity provider returns exceeding 10% which makes it both profitable and easy to use. Mutuum Finance demonstrates strong trust in reliability through independent audits and opens all smart contract components to full public view. First-class transparency forms the basis of Mutuum Finance operations so users can track all platform activities. The upcoming stablecoin release along with the token buyback system will create lasting stability through their ability to stabilize fees and prices. Through payoff systems for liquidity contributors the ecosystem develops both user dedication and confidence among investors. The platform’s user base keeps expanding at a quick pace since it already has over 8,300 participants. Boosting Adoption Through a $100K Community Giveaway To drive further engagement, Mutuum Finance has launched a $100,000 giveaway, awarding ten investors with $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. This initiative not only incentivizes current users but also encourages community-driven expansion through referrals and increased participation. It’s a strategic move that fuels both platform visibility and organic user growth. Phase 4 Presale: A Timely Entry into a Promising DeFi Project Early-stage investors now have a limited-time chance to acquire MUTM tokens at just $0.025 in the ongoing Phase 4 of the presale. As the token is expected to climb incrementally to $0.06 by the final phase, current participants could realize returns of up to 140% even before the token hits the open market. With a growing ecosystem and expert projections pointing to a potential post-launch price of $2, MUTM is being positioned as one of 2025’s breakout DeFi projects. The presale has already generated over $6.9 million in market cap, a strong signal of investor faith and long-term potential. While Shiba Inu (SHIB) shows signs of a bullish reversal, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a top DeFi performer. With its innovative dual-lending model and over $6.9 million raised in presale, MUTM is gaining traction, attracting over 8,400 investors. Phase 4 offers tokens at $0.025, with a 20% price increase in Phase 5. Early adopters could see up to 140% ROI. With strong security, transparency, and a $100K community giveaway, MUTM is positioning itself as one of 2025’s top DeFi projects. Don’t miss out, invest now for potential high returns.

While things are looking good for CAKE, the question is: How long will this last? Let’s take a look at what lies ahead for the token in our PancakeSwap price prediction. Table of Contents What is PancakeSwap? PancakeSwap general outlook PancakeSwap price prediction 2025 PancakeSwap price prediction 2030 What is PancakeSwap? PancakeSwap is one of the most well known decentralized exchanges ( DEX ) operating on the BNB Smart Chain (BSC). PancakeSwap, launched in September 2020, has become a strong competitor to other DEX platforms, like Uniswap, which runs on the Ethereum network. And CAKE is the main currency within the PancakeSwap ecosystem. You can earn it by staking on the platform, where you provide liquidity to different pools and farms, and in return, you receive a share of the fees and rewards. You might also like: PancakeSwap unveils CAKE Tokenomics 3.0, boosting CAKE price by 12% As a CAKE holder, you also get a voice in the platform’s decisions, including updates and protocol changes. Besides staking and governance, CAKE is actively traded across PancakeSwap and other exchanges. A unique feature of PancakeSwap is the CAKE token burn mechanism, which helps stabilize the token’s price by reducing inflation. This ensures the price doesn’t fall drastically due to oversupply, helping maintain liquidity and a consistent exchange rate. What is the CAKE price prediction for 2025 and beyond? Should you invest in PancakeSwap? PancakeSwap general outlook As of April 18, 2025, the price of PancakeSwap stands at $1.91, a 4% drop over the past seven days. It’s still far from its all-time high of $44.18, which it reached almost four years ago, in late April 2021. CAKE 1-day chart, April 2025 | Source: crypto.news According to data from DefiLlama , PancakeSwap reached a weekly trading volume of $6.894 billion on this week, underperforming Uniswap, which had $11.5 billion, and topping the third contender Raydium, which recorded $3.3 billion. As a leading DEX on the BNB Smart Chain, PancakeSwap’s value is closely tied to how actively the platform is used — higher trading volumes and user activity typically lead to greater demand for CAKE. CAKE’s deflationary model, which includes regular token burns and reward adjustments, is designed to reduce supply and support long-term price stability. However, the future price also depends on how PancakeSwap navigates competition from other DEXs, changes in BNB Smart Chain usage, and overall market conditions. If the platform continues to evolve, attract users, and maintain liquidity, the future PancakeSwap price forecast remains cautiously optimistic — driven by innovation, user trust, and practical adoption. Is PancakeSwap a good investment? Let’s take a closer look at the short-term and long-term PancakeSwap coin price prediction. PancakeSwap price prediction 2025 According to CoinCodex’s PancakeSwap price prediction, there’s cautious optimism for the short-term, with the coin potentially reaching $2.21 by the first half of May. Based on CoinCodex’s long-term projections, CAKE is expected to trade between $1.73 and $2.26 in 2025. DigitalCoinPrice’s PancakeSwap price forecast is much more upbeat, with a prediction that CAKE could rise to $4.43 this year. In comparison, Wallet Investor offers a more measured PancakeSwap price prediction, estimating the coin will reach a maximum price of only $0.146 by the end of the year. Will PancakeSwap go up or down in 2030? You might also like: KiloEx DEX exploiter returns $1.4M out of the $7M stolen funds PancakeSwap price prediction 2030 According to Wallet Investor’s expectations, CAKE’s potential maximum price could hit as high as $60.9 by April 2030. DigitalCoinPrice predicts that the PancakeSwap coin price could reach $10.39 in 2030, with a minimum price of $9.61 and a maximum price of $10.92. CoinCodex estimates that by 2030, CAKE’s price could range between $0.79 and $2.96. To sum it up, PancakeSwap has a promising yet uncertain future ahead. While short-term projections are more optimistic with steady gains, long-term expectations for 2030 differ greatly. The key to its future will be how PancakeSwap keeps up with the fast-paced crypto market and its evolving demands. Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

Its ability to scale and be efficient has won over developers and investors. Recently the Solana ecosystem has seen a surge of DeFi projects, NFTs and dApps, solidifying its position as a top tier platform. But as Solana is succeeding Ruvi AI (RUVI) is emerging as a unique player, blending blockchain with AI to solve real world problems in a scalable and practical way. Ruvi AI’s Visionary Ecosystem Ruvi AI takes a different approach from many other crypto projects by focusing on usability and innovation. It offers an advanced superapp with AI powered tools to automate processes, streamline business workflows and enable creators to work more efficiently. Designed for real world application Ruvi AI’s solutions are for businesses, developers and individual users alike, making it stand out in a crowded market. The key to this powerful ecosystem is the $RUVI token , a currency that brings the platform’s tools together in a secure and transparent way. Currently selling at $0.01 per token Ruvi AI’s presale is an amazing entry point for early investors. The confirmed listing price of $0.07 per token is an immediate opportunity for big returns. And analysts project a $1 valuation post listing opening up exponential growth potential. A Great Start Ruvi AI’s early success is already making waves, with the presale achieving impressive results. In just a few days 10 million tokens were sold and $100,000 raised. This rapid adoption is a sign of growing confidence in Ruvi AI’s vision and its ability to deliver. The presale is even more attractive with Ruvi AI’s VIP tier rewards program which incentivizes early adopters with token bonuses. Among the tiers VIP Tier 3 stands out for its balance of accessibility and high rewards. VIP Tier 3 and the ROI Breakdown Investors in VIP Tier 3 must hold 100,000 RUVI tokens, which at the current price of $0.01 per token is $1,000. A 60% bonus is then given, and 60,000 more tokens are added, making it 160,000 tokens. Here’s the breakdown at each price stage: At the confirmed listing price of $0.07 per token, the value of the investor’s tokens is $11,200. That’s a 1,020% ROI ($11,200 from a $1,000 investment). If the $1 valuation comes to pass, those 160,000 tokens will be worth $160,000, that’s a 15,900% ROI. No other blockchain project offers returns like this, Ruvi AI is the only one. Leaderboard Incentives for Big Players To attract more investors Ruvi AI has a leaderboard rewards program for the most active contributors. The top 10 contributors get 500,000 RUVI tokens each, worth $500,000 at the $1 valuation. The top 50 investors receive 250,000 tokens, worth $250,000 and the top 1,000 participants get 20,000 tokens, worth $20,000. This adds more excitement to the presale and rewards loyal backers big time. The Unique Selling Point of Ruvi AI While Solana is great at scalability and ecosystem growth, Ruvi AI is in a different league by combining blockchain and AI to solve real world problems. Its practical tools and the unprecedented ROI makes it a project for smart investors. For those who want to maximize their investment Ruvi AI is an opportunity to back a revolutionary project and get phenomenal returns.Don’t wait, join the revolution.

Bitcoin (BTC) is experiencing a tug-of-war between strong ETF inflows and underlying technical anxieties. XRP, meanwhile, is buoyed by a confluence of positive catalysts. And in the presale arena, FloppyPepe (FPPE) , an AI-driven token, is capturing investor imagination with its promise of substantial returns. This dynamic interplay defines the current crypto landscape. The market mood is one of cautious optimism. While the influx of funds into Bitcoin ETFs signifies growing mainstream acceptance, technical indicators are flashing warning signs, prompting investors to balance enthusiasm with vigilance. This creates a fascinating tension that shapes the overall direction of the market. Bitcoin’s Balancing Act: ETF Demand Versus Technical Signals Bitcoin (BTC) , currently hovering around $85,000, is caught between the robust demand generated by Bitcoin ETFs and emerging technical indicators that suggest a potential correction. The consistent flow of capital into these ETFs validates Bitcoin’s increasing integration into traditional finance, attracting institutional investors and driving up its price. However, some technical analysts are pointing to overbought conditions and bearish divergences, indicating a possible pullback in the near term. Predictions for Bitcoin’s trajectory are therefore varied. While the ETF-driven demand could propel BTC to new heights—some forecasts suggest a surge toward $130,000 later this year. It’s crucial to acknowledge the potential for short-term volatility. The interplay between institutional buying pressure and technical corrections will be a key factor in determining Bitcoin’s price action. XRP’s Double Boost: Legal Progress and Utility Growth XRP, presently trading near $2.15 , is experiencing a resurgence in positive sentiment, fueled by a dual set of catalysts. Progress in its legal battle has alleviated some regulatory uncertainty, clearing the path for greater institutional adoption. Simultaneously, the increasing utilization of XRP for facilitating faster and more cost-effective cross-border payments is enhancing its intrinsic value. These converging forces are creating a favorable environment for XRP. Market observers are increasingly bullish, with some price projections targeting $5.00 by the end of 2025. This optimistic outlook is predicated on the continued resolution of legal issues and the expanding adoption of XRP by global financial institutions. FloppyPepe’s Pre-Launch Hype: An AI Token with Astronomical Potential FloppyPepe (FPPE) , available at a presale price of a mere $0.0000002, has ignited considerable excitement within the crypto community. Its innovative approach, combining the viral appeal of meme coins with the practical applications of artificial intelligence, has captured the attention of both seasoned and novice investors. The presale’s success has fueled speculative price targets. Some analysts are projecting a potential 5,880% to $0.00001176 return post-launch. This astronomical potential for growth is a major draw for early investors, driven by the project’s unique features and community-driven approach. AI-Powered Ecosystem: Innovation Meets Security FloppyPepe’s value proposition is built upon a robust ecosystem powered by AI. “FloppyX” empowers users to generate and share AI-created videos, tapping into the growing popularity of video content. “Meme-o-Matic” allows for the creation and dissemination of viral memes, potentially integrating NFT functionalities to reward creators. This emphasis on user-generated content and community engagement fosters a dynamic and interactive environment. To ensure investor confidence, FloppyPepe has undergone a thorough smart contract audit by SolidProof , a reputable blockchain security firm. This audit provides assurance regarding the project’s security and transparency. The “Floppynomics” model, which includes token burning, holder incentives, and charitable contributions, further promotes a sustainable and rewarding ecosystem. The Enduring Appeal of Presales: Lessons from Crypto’s Genesis While presales carry inherent risks, they also offer the potential for substantial early-adopter rewards. Bitcoin’s history serves as a compelling example. Initially met with skepticism, it transformed early investors into multi-millionaires and billionaires. This historical precedent underscores the potential for significant returns, albeit with a longer timeframe. A strategic allocation of a small portion of one’s portfolio to a promising presale like FloppyPepe – perhaps $100, $500, or $1000 – can be a calculated gamble. The potential upside is significant, while the downside remains limited to the invested amount. Seize the AI Meme Opportunity: The FloppyPepe Presale The FloppyPepe presale represents a unique opportunity to participate in a project that is redefining the meme coin landscape through the integration of artificial intelligence. The potential for substantial returns, coupled with the project’s innovative features and security measures, makes it a compelling investment prospect. Don’t hesitate. Secure your position in the FloppyPepe presale and position yourself to potentially capitalize on the future of AI-driven meme coin innovation.

This could happen not just through technology, but through fairness and equity. In a recent documentary about Cardano’s Constitution, Hoskison explained why blockchain is unlike anything humans have ever created. He explained how blockchains treat everyone equally, regardless of status or background. Blockchains: A Level Playing Field for Everyone The Cardano founder believes blockchains are the first systems in history where no one is above anyone else. Unlike governments and businesses with uneven power, blockchain gives every user an equal voice. He even referred to the U.S. democratic system, where the president and a farmer were equal. However, in a blockchain system, everyone is treated the same. No one has more control than another person. This fairness, Hoskinson says, can help build trust, respect, and understanding among people. Charles Hoskinson believes this fair system can help humans evolve, not just technologically, but emotionally. He sees blockchain as a tool for peace and self-discovery. Instead of competing for power, people can collaborate, build, and thrive together. Cardano Give Community More Control Earlier this year, Cardano made an important change. Its community agreed on a new Constitution that will guide how the network works in the future. With this change, the Cardano community has more power to make decisions. People who hold ADA can vote on changes and help shape the project’s development. This supports Hoskinson’s idea of fairness and shared responsibility. As Cardano grows, its community continues to discuss important topics. One ongoing debate is about how new projects should be funded. Jaromir Tesar, a respected community member, said that teams should not rely only on capital from the Cardano Catalyst Program. Instead, he believes they should focus on building useful projects using Cardano technology. He asserted that the goal should be to build strong ideas, not just to receive grants. ADA’s Price Outlook According to CoinMarketCap, the price of Cardano (ADA) has increased by 0.33% and is now trading at $0.6204. Recent data from Google Trends shows that more people worldwide are searching for Cardano (ADA) again. This level of interest is similar to what was seen in November 2024. Some experts think this growing attention could cause ADA’s price to go up soon . While this is a positive sign, Hoskinson’s message reminds everyone that the real strength of the Cardano blockchain is not its price, but its ability to bring fairness and unity.

The notorious prison, which has had infamous inmates such as Al Capone and Charles Manson, now contains the 32-year-old former crypto billionaire as he begins serving a 25-year fraud sentence. According to Federal Bureau of Prisons records , Bankman-Fried’s new home has also hosted former Theranos COO Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani. His relocation to Terminal Island follows a brief stint at FCI Victorville, a medium-security prison in San Bernardino County, which has been described by insiders as “violent” and “political.” From Oklahoma to California: SBF’s Prison Journey Before he arrived in Los Angeles, Bankman-Fried transferred through the Federal Transfer Facility in Oklahoma City. The series of transfers brings him back to his home state, where he will serve most of his 25-year sentence. Bankman-Fried’s move comes on the heels of giving a high-profile jailhouse interview with media figure Tucker Carlson. The interview made headlines for displaying an early draft Google Doc in which SBF outlined unconventional methods for rehabilitating his public reputation—spelling out the name “Tucker Carlson” incorrectly and urging him to come out against the “woke agenda” publicly. Speculation Rises Over Potential Trump Pardon Strategy Legal experts estimate that Bankman-Fried’s recent high-profile shift to right-wing talking points might be a strategic attempt to set himself up for a potential pardon—in the event of a return to office by Donald Trump. Some commentators interpret the move as an attempt to rewrite the narrative about the FTX meltdown and his conviction. $11 Billion Restitution and 25-Year Sentence In a November 2023 verdict, Bankman-Fried was convicted by a jury on multiple counts of fraud following FTX’s catastrophic collapse. During his March 2024 sentencing, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan remarked, “He knew it was wrong… he’s not going to admit a thing.” As part of his prison term, Bankman-Fried is also required to pay $11 billion in restitution—a staggering figure that reflects the depth of FTX’s fraud.",Blockchain|Regulation,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-04-19 20:27:01

Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominates Q1: Altcoin Season Nowhere In Sight—Report Various attempts to pierce key levels have been unsuccessful, with prices going as low as $0.149 before recovering marginally. Market observers indicate that these short-term setbacks could be a prelude to monumental price swings in either direction. Possible 40% Fall Before The Huge Rally A fresh analysis published on TradingView by SwallowAcademy indicates Dogecoin might see a dramatic drop before any significant price increase. The analyst looked into DOGE’s price action compared to Tether (USDT) on daily charts, where the meme coin has been known to be extremely volatile. Their plots indicate a sudden spike in the beginning of 2024 followed by a decline from highs around $0.23, then another downslide to $0.09 mid-year before recovering above $0.45. SwallowAcademy thinks that the same trend may develop in 2025. However, their prediction is that Dogecoin may decline another 40% to around $0.09, creating a zone of support before, possibly, skyrocketing 400% to $0.45. The price stands at over $0.15 currently, and the analyst is holding out for the anticipated drop to $0.09. The ‘False Break’ Pattern – What It Means A standalone analysis by Trader Tardigrade indicates Dogecoin’s initial “false break” since December 2024. The cryptocurrency has, in general, traced a downtrend of lower highs and lower lows, which are common bearish market indicators. After dropping to $0.13 on April 7, though, the price did bounce briefly before declining once more. Trader Tardigrade reads this as a “false breakdown” – potentially indicating the end of the downtrend. With prices remaining above the support line for a few days, this pattern may indicate an imminent bullish reversal. Based on their analysis, Dogecoin may aim for $0.42 if the reversal occurs. #Dogecoin Makes a False Break for the First Time Since Dec 2024 🔥 It’s staying above the support line for days, confirming the characteristics of a false break. A new $DOGE bull run could start from this false break 🚀 pic.twitter.com/e8ui5FuFxV — Trader Tardigrade (@TATrader_Alan) April 15, 2025 Dogecoin Holder Behavior Statistics from IntoTheBlock show trends in Dogecoin holder behaviors that are differing. Long-term holders (more than one-year holders) lost 2.65% last month. The mid-term, or “Cruisers,” as they’ve been labeled by the report, who hold their coins for between one and twelve months, lost even more by 12%. On the other hand, short-term holders who held for under a month increased by 107%. This realignment is an indicator of increasing speculative demand as opposed to long-term confidence, possibly resulting in enhanced short-term price volatility.

The analyst also mentioned the level that the meme coin needs to hold above in order to maintain its upward trend. What’s Next For Fartcoin As It Reaches Critical Level In an X post, Persis10t revealed that Fartcoin has completed a classic inverse Head and Shoulders pattern , signalling a potential bullish reversal. He added that the neckline around $0.7390 aligns with the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level and 100 EMA, adding strong confluence. The crypto analyst stated that the Fartcoin price is now retesting this zone after a brief rally, with current support holding firm near $0.77. He asserted that as long as this level remains intact, the bulls are in control. Persis10t further claimed that a successful bounce could lead to a continuation towards the $1 psychological zone and beyond. However, there is still a possibility that the bears will take control. Persis10t warned that a daily close below the neckline at around $0.7 could invalidate this Fartcoin’s structure. He told market participants to watch for a strong bullish reaction in this key demand area to confirm trend continuation. For now, the support area to watch out for is $0.73 to $0.66, while the major resistance is the psychological $1 price level. Another Analysis Of The Solana Meme Coin In an X post, crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa provided another price analysis of Fartcoin and revealed what could come next for the Solana meme coin. He predicted that the meme coin could bounce from around $0.70, $0.60, or $0.50, which line up with the 0.382, 0.50, and 0.618 Fibonacci levels, respectively. The crypto analyst opined that the Fartcoin price action after the bounce is the key thing to watch. He remarked that market participants will see if there is a double top and this is a full reversal or if there is some sort of bullish continuation. Regardless of what happens, Altcoin Sherpa believes that the Solana meme coin will experience some kind of pullback around the $1 region the next time it revisits this level. He also noted that Fartcoin’s price heavily depends on Bitcoin, as he claimed that the Solana meme coin has been the best beta for BTC’s price action . If the flagship crypto pulls back further, Altcoin Sherpa opined that Fartcoin will experience a similar pain. However, the crypto analyst remains convinced that the meme coin will go much higher later. He remarked that it is a “very hated and loved coin, which makes for a great trading vehicle.” At the time of writing, the Fartcoin price was trading at around $0.78, up over 4% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",Altcoins|Fartcoin|Fartcoin news|Fartcoin price|FARTCOINUSD|FARTCOINUSDT,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|RUNE|FET|SEI|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-04-19 20:30:38

According to the firm’s data, activity on the XRP Ledger has fallen by 80% since its peak in December, reaching unprecedented lows in recent months. This decline is not limited to on-chain data. A similar decline is also observed in the XRP futures market. There has been a decrease of approximately 70% in open interest, with these levels last seen in November 2023. In addition, funding rates are also in a downward trend and have turned negative at times. According to CryptoQuant’s assessment, XRP’s estimated leverage ratio is also on the decline. This ratio is calculated by dividing open positions by the XRP reserves on an exchange and reflects the average leverage usage of users. Related News: Senior Analyst Claims Bitcoin Price “Could Go Much Higher,” Predicts What Would Happen in This Scenario Despite all this negative data, the XRP price is only down about 35% from its December peak, a more limited decline compared to other major crypto assets like Ethereum, which has lost close to 60% of its value in the same period. Another noteworthy data is the continuous decline in exchange reserves on the XRP Ledger. Exchange reserves, which have fallen to levels last seen in July 2023, may indicate that investors prefer to withdraw their XRP from exchanges and store it for the long term. CryptoQuant claims that this data could be a potential recovery signal for XRP. The relative resilience of the price and the decline in exchange reserves could indicate positive investor sentiment for XRP, even if market conditions remain challenging. *This is not investment advice.

The Westlake, Texas-based firm is already capitalizing on strong engagement with digital assets and is poised to expand its offerings even further, Wurster explained on a recent conference call. According to a transcript, available on Seeking Alpha, the newly appointed CEO pointed to a broad range of available products—from crypto ETFs to Bitcoin ( BTC ) futures—and a rapidly growing interest from both clients and potential customers, adding: “We saw a 400% increase in traffic to our crypto site recently—70% of whom were not clients.” That spike in traffic, Wurster noted, is a sign that Schwab’s reputation as a trusted financial brand is resonating with crypto-curious investors who may have previously been hesitant to jump in. “As people in the industry are thinking about crypto, they’d love to work with a trusted brand… and we’re that firm.” You might also like: Chart of the week: Solana could end crypto market limbo with 10% rally, SOL eyes $150 target Spot crypto trading While Schwab currently enables access to crypto through ETFs, closed-end funds, and futures, Wurster revealed that the firm is actively planning to offer direct access to spot crypto trading. It’s a highly anticipated move anticipated for 2026: “Our goal is to [launch spot crypto] in the next 12 months and we’re on a great path to be able to do that.” Schwab’s potential entry into the spot market would mark a major shift, especially as regulatory clarity improves. Wurster framed the expansion as both a response to client demand and a strategic move to maintain the firm’s role as a top destination for retail and institutional crypto investors alike. As digital assets evolve from fringe fascination to mainstream financial tools, Schwab’s next chapter may look more Web3 than Wall Street. What’s the competition like? Several firms already offer spot crypto trading, giving users direct access to buy and sell actual cryptocurrencies. Leading crypto-native exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, and Gemini dominate the space, offering robust platforms with a wide range of trading pairs and deep liquidity. These platforms are typically favored by both retail and institutional users for their user experience and advanced trading tools. Traditional finance players are also entering the arena. Fidelity, through its Fidelity Crypto platform, offers spot Bitcoin and Ethereum trading, while Robinhood and eToro enable commission-free crypto trades alongside stocks and ETFs.

Referencing a chart from IntoTheBlock, Brett pointed out that the total value locked (TVL) in RWA platforms has now exceeded $10 billion. This chart shows a steady climb in TVL from under $5 billion in mid-2024 to over $10 billion by April 2025, marking more than 100% growth within a year. The upward momentum is important as it reflects expanding confidence and capital inflows into blockchain-based tokenization of traditional assets such as real estate, credit, and government bonds. BOOOOOOOOOOOOM 💥💥🔥 BULLISH: The total value locked in real-world asset ( #RWA ) protocols has surpassed $10 billion, continuing its growth trend. $XRP pic.twitter.com/tdah8kbuxq — Brett (@Brett_Crypto_X) April 18, 2025 Implications for XRP in the Tokenization Sector This development carries strong implications for digital assets like XRP, which have been building infrastructure to support tokenized assets. Ripple has made it clear that real-world asset tokenization is a core focus. The company recently partnered with RWA.xyz to allow seamless tracking of tokenized assets and RLUSD on the XRP Ledger and has made significant strides in the tokenization market. As the RWA sector draws in more capital, XRP is best positioned to support the coming wave of tokenized assets. Its infrastructure is already tailored to these needs and is a natural fit for institutions looking to move from pilot projects to real-world implementations. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP Positioned for Utility-Based Growth The XRPL is engineered for efficiency and interoperability, both vital traits in the tokenization landscape. As traditional financial firms explore blockchain solutions, those with proven scalability will stand out. The XRPL already hosts tokenized Treasury Bills (T-Bills) and other assets and has become a popular choice for institutions looking to launch RWAs on the blockchain. WhiteRock, a multi-million dollar tokenized securities platform, recently went live on the XRPL , bringing tokenized stocks, bonds, gold, silver, and other real-world assets into the digital finance ecosystem. The $10 billion milestone shows that tokenization is not a distant concept but is already underway. This rise in locked value across protocols signals that institutional demand is growing, and as Brett pointed out, the market is responding favorably. XRP, one of the few digital assets with existing enterprise solutions for real-world value transfer, could benefit significantly from this adoption curve. If the trend in RWA TVL continues, the digital asset’s relevance as a settlement asset and infrastructure layer will become even more pronounced. Brett’s post serves as a timely signal that the tokenization market is accelerating, and XRP is capitalizing on that growth.

The plan suggests cutting stakeholder rewards from 7% to 3.79%, prompting support and opposition across different stakeholders. Aptos Push for Innovation Faces Resistance from Validators According to reports, the main argument behind AIP-119 is to move user focus from passive staking to more active use of capital within the ecosystem. Many supporters believe the current 7% reward encourages holding tokens without driving innovation. According to their position, reducing this yield can free up capital to support activities such as restaking, MEV extraction, and deeper participation in DeFi protocols. Proponents also argue that high-stakes returns are similar to excessive interest rates in traditional finance. The proposal’s authors describe the 7% as a risk-free benchmark and stress their position by stating that it might be holding the system back from realistic growth. Some, like crypto user Moon Shiesty, believe the drop in staking demand will be balanced out by inflation control and new projects launching in the next half-year. He mentioned that funds saved from staking rewards could be used to support early Layer 1 stablecoins through incentives and lower gas fees. Meanwhile, Aptos recently shifted its focus toward strengthening its NFT and DeFi ecosystem . This aims to attract developers and projects looking for alternatives to Ethereum and Solana. Smaller Validators Fear Getting Priced Out It is worth noting that not everyone agrees. The report also disclosed that smaller validators say the proposal could hurt their ability to remain in the network. Running a validator node on Aptos costs between $15,000 and $35,000 annually. With rewards dropping, some fear they might not break even. The report details that more than 50 validators currently hold less than 3 million APT each. They represent just 9% of the total network but are important for maintaining decentralization. The proposal includes a delegation plan to support these operators by assigning extra tokens to help them stay afloat. Call for Balance in Governance Decisions It is important to add that notable Voices like Yui, COO of Slime Revolution, are urging caution. While speaking on the development, she warned that pushing out smaller players could affect the system’s health in the long run. Meanwhile, others argue that lowering emissions could lead to price growth, making up for the lower yield. The proposal remains under review, with the community watching closely. In related news, Aptos recently unveiled new upgrades for faster and more scalable blockchain solutions. According to reports, the upgrade was designed to increase transaction throughput and reduce latency.

Tokyo faces a 24% levy on most exports to the United States, though that rate, like many of President Donald Trump’s duties, has been paused for 90 days. The temporary freeze is due to expire in early July, and economists warn that a snap‑back could jolt trade in both directions. A 10% universal tariff still applies, and finished cars—one of Japan’s biggest money earners—carry a separate 25% charge. Because the two countries follow different crash‑test systems, officials in Tokyo believe they can narrow the gap. Letting U.S. models meet American standards instead of Japan’s would be offered in exchange for lighter tariffs, unnamed sources told Nikkei . The tariff dispute has shaken markets and stirred fears of a deeper slowdown. Japan is trying to roll back what Trump calls “reciprocal” duties that he has imposed on dozens of trading partners. After one of the first round‑table sessions since the trade offensive began, Trump said Wednesday that the two sides had made “big progress.” Industry analysts say the wider fight over car tariffs could steer the future of electric vehicles in the United States. Tariffs may slow EV adoption in the US Many lower‑priced electric cars sold in America are imported. The 25% duty Trump placed on them is expected to raise sticker prices and curb demand. Higher costs and slower sales would squeeze profit margins and leave less money for research and development. “If they are having to spend more money to either pay for tariffs or move production to the U.S., that’s significant capex for most of the companies,” said Sam Abuelsamid, vice president of market research at Telemetry. “That’s funding not going to R&D, which means they’re not going to be able to innovate and not bring new technologies to market. That will make them less competitive in the global marketplace at a time they’re already getting shut out of China.” Affordability is already a hurdle Dealer data company Cox Automotive Inc. says the average transaction price of a new electric vehicle tops $55,000. Buyers also worry about driving range, public chargers, charging speed, grid stability, and a political debate over the cars’ role in cutting emissions. Trump has ordered a review of the federal tax credit of up to $7,500 that helps consumers. Analysts warn that adding a 25% tariff to imported models—one tool automakers have used to keep prices down—could lift costs by $4,000 to $20,000 per vehicle. Trump is acting under Section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act, saying the country needs a strong manufacturing base and secure supply chain. He argues that the duties will bring jobs home, raise tax revenue, and help reduce the federal debt. The same 25% rate will hit imported auto parts starting May 3. Parts that meet the rules of the United States‑Mexico‑Canada Agreement, which Trump signed in 2020, are exempt until the non‑U.S. share can be measured. There may be one bright spot for battery cars. The battery pack is the most expensive part of an electric vehicle. The Inflation Reduction Act, signed by former President Joe Biden in 2022, offers subsidies for battery plants in the United States, and billions of dollars are flowing into new factories. Officials say that, once a tracking system is in place, the auto tariffs will cover only the content made outside the country. A car assembled in Mexico but fitted with U.S.‑made batteries could avoid most of the duty. The administration has not said when that accounting will begin. For now, negotiators hope that a shift in Japan’s crash‑test rules will be enough to ease tensions and soften tariffs that have upended trade flows across the Pacific.

Charles Schwab CEO hints spot BTC trading may come in April 2026 Charles Schwab CEO Rick Wurster said the financial services company is looking at a potential April 2026 target to rollout spot Bitcoin trading to its clients. According to RIABiz , the CEO said that crypto was attracting traffic to the financial service company's crypto-focused website. 70% of that traffic was not Schwab clients and represented potentially new prospects, Wurster said. The Schwab CEO gave a timeline for the rollout: “Our expectation is that with the changing regulatory environment, we are hopeful and likely to be able to launch direct spot crypto. Our goal is to do that in the next 12 months."" The move comes at a time when many traditional financial institutions are increasingly adopting crypto or offering digital asset products to their clients. Crypto, DeFi may widen wealth gap, destabilize finance: BIS report The growing adoption of cryptocurrencies may pose risks to the traditional financial system and exacerbate wealth inequality, according to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). In an April 15 report , the BIS warned that the number of investors and amount of capital in crypto and decentralized finance (DeFi ) have “reached a critical mass,” with investor protection becoming a “significant concern for regulators.” The size of the crypto market signals that authorities should be worried about the “stability of crypto over and above the role it may have for TradFi and the real economy,” the report states, highlighting the role of stablecoins, which the BIS said have “become the means through which participants transfer value within crypto.” BIS report on crypto and DeFi’s functions and financial stability implications. Source: BIS The report calls for targeted stablecoin regulation on stability and reserve asset requirements that will guarantee the redemption of stablecoins for US dollars during “stressed market conditions.” Lyn Alden lowers Bitcoin forecast after “tariff kerfuffle,” eyes liquidity Macroeconomist Lyn Alden expects Bitcoin to finish 2025 higher than its current price of around $85,000, though she says it would have been much higher if not for US President Donald Trump’s tariff announcement in February. “Before all this tariff kerfuffle, I would have had a higher price target,” Alden told Natalie Brunell on the April 17 episode of Coin Stories. “My guess is that we end up higher at the end of the year than we are now, at least,” she added. Lyn Alden spoke to Coin Stories’ host Natalie Brunell on April 17. Source: Natalie Brunell However, she said that a “massive liquidity unlock” could be the catalyst needed for Bitcoin to reach more optimistic targets, similar to those before the tariffs were introduced. For example, if the US bond market “broke” and the US Federal Reserve had to step in with measures like yield curve control or heavy quantitative easing (QE), Alden explained.",Trump memecoin|Solana memecoin|TRUMP token|Solana|SOL|Nova Labs|SEC|Securities and Exchange Commission|crypto regulation|TRUMP rally|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|AVAX|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|ICO|LINK|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SOL|SPONSORED|TRADING|USDT|XRP|ZRX|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BNB|FDUSD|TON|USDC|ENA|ZK|WLD|OM|KAVA|ARKM,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-04-19 21:50:26

In its most recent SEC filing dated April 15, the company revealed a paper loss of approximately $41.8 million for the first quarter of 2025. This loss stems from the sharp drop in BTC prices, which slid from $93,500 at the beginning of January to almost $82,000 by March 31. Semler Scientific Sees Steep Losses Despite the downturn , Semler remains heavily invested in the cryptocurrency and holds 3,182 BTC at quarter’s end. The firm, which ranks as the twelfth-largest corporate Bitcoin holder globally, right above Boyaa Interactive International Limited, continues to double down on its digital asset strategy. CEO Doug Murphy-Chutorian reiterated this stance when he affirmed the company’s dual focus on Bitcoin accumulation and ongoing healthcare innovation. Financially, Semler projected modest revenue between $8.8 million and $8.9 million for the quarter, but operating losses are expected to land between $1.3 million and $1.5 million. As of March 31, Semler reported having about $10 million in cash and cash equivalents. In yet another strategic move, the company also announced plans to issue up to $500 million in securities, the proceeds of which are earmarked for general corporate purposes, including continued cryptocurrency purchases. However, investor sentiment appears wary. The company’s stock, traded under the ticker SMLR on the Nasdaq, has declined by more than 22% since the start of the year. Agreement With DOJ Semler Scientific announced via a separate 8-K filing that it has reached an agreement-in-principle to resolve longstanding legal concerns with the Department of Justice (DOJ). The company said that it is prepared to pay around $30 million to address allegations that it violated the False Claims Act through improper marketing practices tied to devices billed to Medicare. The DOJ’s civil investigation dates back to 2017, when it issued a formal demand to examine potential fraud. While this proposed settlement would mark a major step toward resolution, Semler’s filing noted that a finalized agreement with the agency is not yet guaranteed.

Fast transactions and cross border payments are what XRP is known for and has been a pioneer in displaying the capabilities of blockchain. But as the crypto space matures, the spotlight is shifting to platforms that combine blockchain with other game changing technologies. Enter Ruvi AI (RUVI) , a project that will redefine innovation by merging artificial intelligence with decentralized technology. Ruvi AI is getting a lot of attention in the crypto space and for good reason. This forward thinking project has already sold 10 million $RUVI tokens and raised over $100,000 in just a few days of its presale. The excitement around Ruvi AI is not just about the ROI but also the utilities and the vision. What Sets Ruvi AI Apart? Ruvi AI isn’t launching another cryptocurrency, it’s launching an entire ecosystem that solves real world problems. At the heart of it is the Ruvi AI superapp, a feature rich platform that allows users to use AI for various tasks, from generating professional level content to creating visuals and multimedia. By holding the $RUVI token, users get access to this ecosystem and benefits including: Access to Premium AI Tools Whether you’re a marketer, content creator or entrepreneur, Ruvi AI’s superapp lets you streamline your workflow with AI generated text, images and even multimedia. Passive Income Opportunities Investors can stake their $RUVI tokens to earn rewards, effectively turn their holdings into a steady stream of income. Governance Rights Unlike traditional platforms, Ruvi AI gives token holders a voice in the decision making process of the ecosystem and features. This combination of utility, income and community driven governance makes $RUVI more than just a speculative asset. It’s a tool for innovation and growth. Limited Time Opportunity before 50% Price Increase The window to get in on Ruvi AI’s early growth is closing. During the current presale, $RUVI tokens are priced at just $0.01 each. Once this phase is over, the token price will increase by 50%, so now is the time to get in. For those looking to maximize returns, Ruvi AI’s VIP bonus structure offers additional rewards. Through this system, investors can earn extra tokens based on the size of their presale contribution. VIP Tier 2 Example: Big Rewards for Small Investors To show how good the VIP system is, let’s say an investor puts in a small $500 during the presale. At the current price of $0.01 per token, that’s 50,000 $RUVI tokens, which qualifies the investor for VIP Tier 2. This tier gets a 40% bonus, which adds 20,000 tokens to their total allocation, making it 70,000 tokens. At the listed price of $0.07 per token, the original $500 investment becomes $4,900, a 880% ROI. That’s what Ruvi AI is offering to its early supporters. Leaderboard Rewards Add Extra Incentives If the VIP rewards weren’t enough, Ruvi AI has a leaderboard rewards program to recognize and reward its top investors. Throughout the presale , the biggest token holders are ranked and significant bonuses are given based on tiered rankings: Top 10 investors get an extra 500,000 $RUVI tokens (a $35,000 value at the listed price). Top 50 investors get 250,000 tokens as a reward. Even broader groups, like the Top 1,000 get 20,000 tokens each. These bonuses stack on top of the VIP tier rewards, so serious investors get even more returns and a community driven environment. While XRP has established itself as a major player in the blockchain space, Ruvi AI is heading into uncharted territory. By combining blockchain with the power of artificial intelligence, this platform is solving real world problems and disrupting industries like digital media and content creation. Market analysts and crypto enthusiasts are raving about Ruvi AI’s utility, presale performance and vision. The $RUVI token is not just any other cryptocurrency, it’s an investment in the tools and technologies of the future. Next Steps for Ruvi AI The crypto world moves fast and those who get in early get the biggest returns. Ruvi AI has everything an investor could want in a blockchain project: innovative technology, tangible utilities and massive ROI potential. But time is running out. The first phase will be over soon and the price will increase by 50%. Now is the time to get in. Join the early adopters and get in on Ruvi AI.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging from the shadows with the kind of early metrics and innovation that once defined top-tier projects. Those involved in the altcoin presale are purchasing MUTM tokens at a price of $0.025, with the platform raising a total of $6.9 million so far. The presale has attracted over 8,400 participants, and many anticipate that the token price will rise to $0.03 at the start of the next phase. Those investing at this stage stand to make up to 140% in profit once the projected launch price of $0.06 is reached. If the projections hold, this token may not just catch up to SOL and XRP, it could fly right past them. Mutuum Finance Presale: A Growing DeFi Solution Mutuum Finance has attracted more investors due its advanced Decentralized Finance (DeFi) lending solutions is gaining significant momentum in the market. Through innovative decentralized finance mechanisms and crypto lending services the platform collected more than $6.9 million and accumulated 8,400 members in its community. MUTM tokens currently sell for $0.025 before their value will grow to $0.03 within the next round of the presale. Investors will achieve a substantial gain of 140% when Mutuum Finance hits its initial launch price of $0.06. The advanced lending system of Mutuum Finance drives the transformation of decentralized markets while it consolidates its market position. Social media channels will release the results of the Certik smart contract audit after the completion of this audit by the team. Rewarding Early Investors & Expanding the Community Mutuum Finance strives to acquire more users and provides financial benefits to its initial investor community. To award early investors MUTM platform provides ten lucky winners a total of $100,000 distributed in equal amounts of $10,000 USD value MUTM tokens. Mutuum Finance allows new investors to benefit when they refer members to the platform which creates an inclusive investor community. The first users who join gain complete access to unique staking keys together with voting rights along with premium platform updates which encourages them to stay involved. The Ethereum-based platform achieves price stability by letting users deposit USD funds and operate within it stablecoin system. This transaction system utilizes a resilient solution to eliminate stability problems that typically appear in financial operations. Mutuum Finance leverages modern lending innovations and secure operational platforms to execute permanent changes within Decentralized Finance (DeFi). The Dual-Model Crypto Lending System Mutuum Finance distinguishes itself through its two-part crypto lending system that combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models to bring users better asset availability with enhanced transparency. Smart contract pools in the P2C model enable stablecoin lending by users so platform users can obtain instant borrowing access with passive income opportunities. Automatic interest rate adjustments enabled through smart contracts provide value to lenders through higher returns and lower costs of borrowing to borrowers. Decentralized lending takes place on the P2P model so users can bypass traditional financial institutions during their transactions. The borrowers and lenders can both negotiate specific loan conditions through this system to create an easier and more personalized process. All parties benefit from platform transparency because it provides users full control over their transactions thereby establishing trust and grants them power in their lending and borrowing activities. While giants like Solana (SOL) and XRP remain strong contenders, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quietly positioning itself as a serious challenger. With $6.9 million raised and over 8,400 investors already on board, MUTM’s innovative dual-lending model and growing presale momentum signal massive upside potential. Early investors at $0.025 could see up to 140% ROI by launch. Don’t miss your window and get in early.

After months of downward pressure, analysts are eyeing a possible breakout toward the long-awaited $1 target. $1 Dogecoin Price Target Closer Than Ever Crypto analyst Master Kenobi believes that the Dogecoin price could reach the highly coveted $1 target before the end of this market cycle. Based on his technical analysis, DOGE is once again mirroring a historical breakout pattern that previously led to an explosive surge in price. Related Reading: Is Shiba Inu On Track To Dethrone Dogecoin? Here’s What The Experts Say The analyst shared a Dogecoin price chart with two main sections highlighted. The first green box, between September to November 2024, shows a historical breakout that occurred after the meme coin broke above a critical descending trendline. Following this breakout, the price surged significantly over the next 55 days. Notably, the descending trendline has acted as a strong resistance for months. However, with Dogecoin’s momentum currently building, Master Kenobi believes that a strong breakout is imminent. Looking at DGOE’s price action, it appears the same conditions for its previous breakout are forming again. Master Kenobi’s technical analysis suggests that a breakout above the current descending resistance line could spark a similar rally, one that could potentially take Dogecoin from its current price of $0.158 to $0.9 or even $1. Such a move would represent a staggering gain of approximately 533%. Similar to past trends, Dogecoin’s current chart indicates a projected 55-day move following the breakout, with the green arrow and shaded box indicating a path to the conservative $0.9 target. This would place Dogecoin’s target window during the first few weeks of June, aligning closely with historical timelines from the last major breakout. Adding to the optimism, Dogecoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently sits around 43.35 — a level typically considered a neutral to oversold zone. The current descending resistance line has already been tested multiple times, meaning a clean daily close above it could spark Dogecoin’s next major rally. Dogecoin RSI Shifts From Bearish To Bullish Dogecoin is showing promising signs of a bullish reversal after a key breakout of a technical pattern on the 4-hour chart. According to a recent chart analysis by crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade, Dogecoin has exited a Falling Wedge formation and is preparing for an uptrend continuation. The breakout was confirmed as the RSI crossed above the 50 level, signaling a shift from bearish to bullish sentiment among traders. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominates Q1: Altcoin Season Nowhere In Sight—Report Before the Falling Wedge breakout, Dogecoin had been trading in a downward channel, characterized by lower highs and lower lows.
