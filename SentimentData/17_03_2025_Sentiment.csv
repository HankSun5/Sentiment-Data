41773764,https://coinpaprika.com/news/libra-creator-hayden-davis-linked-to-wolf-token-amid-new-controversy,1742160476,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/41773764.jpeg,LIBRA Creator Hayden Davis Linked to WOLF Token Amid New Controversy,https://coinpaprika.com/news/libra-creator-hayden-davis-linked-to-wolf-token-amid-new-controversy,"Hayden Davis, the controversial creator of the LIBRA meme coin, has been linked to a new token called WOLF , which shares similarities with his past projects. Blockchain analysis from Bubblemaps revealed that 82% of WOLF’s supply was controlled by a small group of wallets, fueling suspicions of insider manipulation. This development comes as Argentine authorities continue investigating Davis for his involvement in the LIBRA scandal. Davis launched WOLF around the time that Jordan Belfort, the real-life ""Wolf of Wall Street,"" was rumored to be introducing a meme coin under the same name. The sudden buzz around WOLF drew attention from traders, particularly the WallStreetBets (WSB) community, sending its market cap surging to $40 million. However, just like previous Davis-related tokens, WOLF’s price plummeted soon after, with analysts suspecting a rug pull. Blockchain data indicated that the token’s supply was funneled through a web of addresses before leading back to a wallet linked to Davis. Blockchain analytics firm Bubblemaps tracked the movement of WOLF’s funds and found that they had been transferred across 17 wallets and five different blockchains before arriving at a single address identified as belonging to Davis. The similarities between WOLF and his past projects, including MELANIA and LIBRA, further reinforced suspicions of a pattern of coordinated token launches followed by price crashes. Davis has a history of controversial meme coin projects. LIBRA, one of his previous tokens, became a political scandal when Argentine President Javier Milei briefly endorsed it. This endorsement sent the token’s value skyrocketing past $4 billion before it collapsed, wiping out nearly all of its value. Blockchain analysts discovered that key insiders, who had acquired large amounts of LIBRA before Milei’s endorsement, quickly sold their holdings for over $100 million, leaving retail investors at a loss. Davis later admitted to playing a role in the LIBRA project and also confessed to launching a meme coin associated with former US First Lady Melania Trump. His involvement in multiple meme coin controversies has drawn legal attention, particularly from Argentine authorities who have launched an official investigation into the LIBRA case. The fallout from LIBRA has also led Argentine lawyer Gregorio Dalbon to call for an Interpol Red Notice against Davis, which could result in his arrest and possible extradition. Critics argue that Davis' continued involvement in the crypto space raises concerns about the lack of oversight in meme coin projects. The rapid creation of tokens, often associated with high-profile names, has become a strategy to generate market hype before an eventual collapse. These tactics have repeatedly left investors holding worthless tokens while a select few profit significantly. The growing scrutiny around Davis’ actions reflects broader concerns about the risks associated with meme coins and the need for regulatory oversight. Many traders remain drawn to the speculative nature of these projects, but the repeated pattern of sudden crashes has raised red flags within the cryptocurrency community. As legal pressure mounts, it remains unclear whether Davis will face consequences for his role in these projects. While some argue that buyers should conduct thorough research before investing in highly speculative tokens, others believe that stricter regulations are needed to prevent high-profile manipulations like the ones Davis has been accused of orchestrating. The case of WOLF serves as another example of the volatility and unpredictability of the meme coin market. While meme coins continue to attract traders looking for quick profits, the risks associated with unverified projects remain high. With authorities increasingly scrutinizing such schemes, the future of unchecked meme coin launches may be in question.",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-16 21:27:56

The streamer says she was held at gunpoint by several individuals demanding that she hand over the private keys to her crypto. According to Fox 26 , the suspects include Dylan Nesho Campbell, Bryan Anthony Salazar Guerrero and two additional suspects between the ages of 16-17. Campbell and Guerrero were each charged with aggravated kidnapping and aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon, as was the 17-year-old suspect. Siragusa reported that several armed individuals entered her home late at night on March 2, beat her, and held her at gunpoint, demanding her cryptocurrency. Source: Amouranth Luckily, her husband was on speakerphone, which the gunmen took in an attempt to access a crypto app. The husband, having been alerted to the situation, grabbed a handgun while attempting to gauge where the armed men were in the home. The online streamer led the assailants around the home and convinced them to start looking for a cold storage device. As the armed robbers were looking for the device, Siragusa ran upstairs to her husband, who was also watching the situation unfold on the home's network of cameras. Once she was safely upstairs, her husband fired off three rounds at assailants, likely shooting one in the process before the home invaders retreated and law enforcement arrived at the scene. Siragusa’s husband later revealed that he was the one posting from her account as the incident unfolded. Source: Amouranth The streamer previously disclosed that she held roughly 211 Bitcoin, worth over $20 million in November 2024, to online followers — making her a target for armed robbery.

However, volatility and uncertainty have dominated the market since the start of the month, keeping LINK’s price action unstable. Related Reading: Cardano Is ‘About To Break Free’ – Breakout Above Crucial Supply To Trigger A Big Move–Analyst The token has seen wild price swings, moving from $17 down to $13, briefly rebounding to $16, and then collapsing to a low of $11.8. Bulls are now fighting to push LINK back above the $15 mark, but momentum remains weak, and the market appears to be consolidating around current levels. Despite this uncertainty, on-chain data is showing promising signs. Metrics from Santiment reveal that 640,000 LINK were pulled off exchanges in the last 24 hours, which is typically a bullish signal. Large withdrawals from exchanges often indicate long-term accumulation, as investors move their holdings into private wallets instead of keeping them available for immediate selling. With exchange outflows rising, traders are watching closely to see if LINK can break through resistance levels and confirm a shift toward bullish momentum. The next few trading sessions will be key in determining whether LINK can recover or if further consolidation is ahead. Uncertainty Looms As Investors Watch For A Breakout Chainlink is currently holding above the $13.5 mark, struggling to reclaim higher levels as selling pressure and market uncertainty persist. Despite its recent recovery attempts, LINK remains stuck below key resistance, making investors cautious about its short-term direction. Analysts and traders are concerned about a potential drop below the current range, as on-chain metrics suggest a distribution phase may be unfolding. If LINK fails to hold its support zone, it could see renewed selling pressure, sending the price toward lower demand levels. However, not all signals are bearish. Crypto expert Ali Martinez shared Santiment data on X, revealing that 640,000 LINK were pulled off exchanges in the last 24 hours. This is often seen as a bullish indicator, as large investors typically withdraw their holdings from exchanges when they anticipate higher prices in the future. When whales and long-term holders accumulate, it reduces selling pressure on the market and strengthens price stability. If LINK manages to break key resistance levels, this accumulation trend could set the stage for a strong recovery rally.

The next few days will be critical as investors watch for a breakout or further downside movement. Chainlink Bulls Defend Key Support Levels Chainlink (LINK) is currently trading at $14, facing resistance at the $15 level as bulls struggle to reclaim higher ground. The market remains under pressure, and LINK must hold current levels to avoid a deeper correction. For a recovery rally to take shape, bulls need to defend the $13 support zone and build momentum toward a breakout above $15. If LINK successfully pushes past this resistance, the next major target is the $17 level, where it must reclaim the 200-day moving average (MA) and the exponential moving average (EMA) to confirm a bullish trend reversal. However, if LINK fails to hold its current support levels, selling pressure could intensify, driving the price toward the $10 range or even lower levels. This would put LINK in a deeper downtrend, making a short-term recovery more difficult.

The Best Meme Coins for Exponential Returns include Arctic Pablo Coin , a thrilling adventure-themed crypto, Official Melania, a politically charged meme token, and Shiba Inu, the legendary Dogecoin rival. Each of these coins brings something unique to the table, whether it’s a high-stakes presale, community-driven growth, or a strong ecosystem. Investors are eyeing these trending meme coins for their potential to deliver massive returns, making them some of the hottest opportunities in the market right now. Arctic Pablo Coin: The Best New Meme Coin for Exponential Returns on an Icy Adventure Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) isn’t just another meme coin presale ; it’s one of the Best New Meme Coins for Exponential Returns, inviting investors on an exhilarating expedition led by the intrepid explorer, Arctic Pablo. This narrative-driven cryptocurrency transforms the investment journey into a thrilling adventure, blending storytelling with financial opportunity. Unlike traditional presales divided into stages, Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale is structured around unique locations, each representing a chapter in Pablo’s quest. Currently, in its 14th location, Frosty Falls, $APC is priced at $0.000074 per token. Early investors have already raised over $1.88 million, anticipating a remarkable 10,694.59% return on investment when the coin lists at $0.008. This innovative approach not only adds excitement but also makes Arctic Pablo Coin one of the Best New Meme Coins for Exponential Returns, as each location unlocks new opportunities for investors. To enhance scarcity and value, Arctic Pablo Coin employs a deflationary mechanism by burning unsold tokens weekly during the presale. This strategy ensures that the total supply decreases over time, potentially increasing the value of remaining tokens. All burn transactions are transparently recorded on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), reinforcing trust within the community. Investors can further benefit from staking their $APC tokens, earning a generous 66% Annual Percentage Yield (APY).

But will the price cross the much anticipated $1 mark this year? This has been the main focus of much of the debate on the price these last few weeks, especially as the price showed a strong bearish hit in the last few months. However, while the price hitting $1 has seen much debate, some analysts have started speculating that Remittix might hit the $1 mark before Shiba Inu. But seeing that the Remittix token is a more recent addition to the market, could the Remittixprice growth cause it to hit $1 before a top option like the Shiba Inu? When is Shiba Inu Price Hitting $1? The Shiba Inu price has been in a negative direction since the start of this year, dropping as low as 52% in the last 90 days. This is even a fair value due to its recent growth in the last 7 days, which saw it end the week at 2.7% growth. Overall, the price outlook of the coin reflected that it has been on a bearish move for the last 4 months. However, using the recent price change, is the Shiba Inu price showing a possible price jump towards $1 soon? There was a strong bearish impact on the Shiba Inu price earlier this year due to the surge in meme coins, which has slowed the growth of the Shiba coin. But, following the slight change in direction in the last few days, the Shiba Inu daily chart shows the coin on an uptrend seen from the breakout above the 7 SMA. However, it is too early to take this growth literally to mean the price is heading toward a new high. The Shiba Inu price chart shows that there are still a couple of levels that could show strong resistance for the coin to break. Some of the notable resistance to break includes the current zone at $0.00001270, the $0.00002021 zone, $0.00003075, and the old ATH at $0.00008846. Breaking these zones could help the Shiba Inu coin cancel out some zeros, but the $1 range could still be far-reaching and might not be possible this year. Remittix Stays Closer to Hitting $1 This Year The Remittix token has been the talk of top analysts for the past few weeks, as the new token continues to wow investors and critics with its growth so far. While the Remittix presale round gets closer every day to its final lap, the price growth has not shown any sign of slowing down. Currently, the funds raised in the Remittix ICO have hit a new high of almost $13.9M, showing the resilience and strong potential of this new token. However, while the Remittix token continues to look like it can only keep going up, what does the future look like after its presale round? The Remittix token, being a big project of the Remittix exchange, has been designed to get strong backing from the exchange. The Remittix exchange, however, is a new crypto solution changing the dynamics of crypto-FIAT payment. This solution helps users convert and send cryptocurrencies from their wallet directly to a bank account cheaply and faster. This new solution in the crypto market and the projected high demand for the exchange service by individuals and businesses are what analysts believe will keep driving the Remittixprice up. Although the presale price of the Remittix token is currently $0.0734, it is projected to see a surge of over 50x after launching, meaning the price will grow 50 times. This could easily take the Remittix price over $1 before the end of this year. This would be a great opportunity to take advantage of the Remittix token price now, which is less than $1.

As several projects struggle with volatility, investors are now taking a hard look at cryptocurrencies quietly reaching milestones. One such project, the Pi Coin, just had its sixth birthday, attracting investors' interest. However, another token , Remittix, remains in the shadows and might have greater potential. Pi Coin Celebrates Big Milestones—What Does It Mean for Investors? Currently priced at around $1.4, Pi Network celebrated its sixth birthday recently , with two milestones: the Mainnet migration completion and the successful launch of Open Network PiFest. These steps reflect the platform's maturity and increasing adoption. Pi Network's recent auctions of the.pi domain are strengthening its ecosystem, bringing in real-world use cases. Price action is still mixed, with Pi Coin trading between $1.20 and $1.90 as the community raises concerns about stringent KYC verification policies. Pi Coin bull investors are hopeful that upcoming exchange listings and additional adoption can boost the token exponentially. Some predictors even estimate prices to rise as high as $200-$500 in 2030 if the market environment is favorable. But dangers do lurk. Falling below the key support of $1.20 would take Pi Coin downwards, and wary investors would shy away from committing themselves fully. Pi has to keep up the momentum in order not to fall into bearishness. Source: Tradingview Remittix Shines as a Hidden Gem at $0.0734 Despite the success of the Pi Coin, Remittix is quietly building itself into a crypto market dark horse. With a current price of $0.0734, Remittix is making headlines with its revolutionary PayFiprotocol. Already having raised close to $13.9 million in its presale phase, Remittix sent over 520 million tokens into wallets, reflecting the rising popularity. Apparently, investors are impressed by the real-world functionality delivered by the project and have expressed huge confidence in its development prospects. Compared to other altcoins, Remittix simplifies payments in cryptocurrency. People can send cryptocurrency and convert it instantly into their currency in the real world, solving one of cryptocurrency's biggest problems: utilizing it in the real world. Consider an Ethiopian coffee exporter who receives payment from Europe and North America. Gains in most instances are lost due to delayed wire transfers and costly conversions leading to loss and lateness. Remittix receives such payments in real-time and remits them directly into cash currency in the local country. This easy solution aside from saving expense also saves efficiency and this is why businesses use Remittix over other payment systems. To this end, Remittix raised close to $13.9 million in its presale process by selling over a half a billion tokens. These figures show immense investor support for the Remittix cause and set it up for immense growth this year. Contrary to the majority of hype tokens, Remittix adoption comes as a result of practical use and thus remains very attractive to investors in times of volatile markets. Remittix Could Be the Crypto Star of 2025 As investors evaluate Pi Coin and similar projects, Remittix’s practical approach to digital payments positions it uniquely. Its growing popularity among merchants and individual users illustrates a genuine market need. Remittix’s PayFi protocol addresses real-world problems, such as delays, high fees, and exchange rate losses. This creates consistent demand even when broader markets fluctuate. Given its strong early performance, Remittix could easily become one of this year’s breakout stars. Investors looking for stability and tangible benefits should seriously consider this promising newcomer in crypto. Ready to explore the token analysts call the hidden gem of 2025? Visit Remittix to discover how its PayFi approach is changing cross-border transactions and why investors are jumping in early.

The rapid growth of Pi Coin got attention in the past but Remittix (RTX) stands as a rising contender that demands increasing attention. The directed strategy combined with practical financial solution development at Remittix positions it to have stronger prospects than Pi Network despite recent challenges. A Tough Stretch for Pi Coin The coin price for Pi Coin experienced downward trends throughout recent weeks.

At the time when these price decreases happened Pi Coin held between $1.43 and $1.59 trading rates before dropping to about 51% under its $2.99 highest mark in history on CoinGecko records. source: coingecko.com The value decline becomes associated with continuous obstacles throughout the Pi Network.

Numerous users of Pi Coin encountered significant difficulties during the mainnet migration because of KYC and technical problems and token transfer issues.

Remittix (RTX) is the one to watch in 2025. Its innovative crypto-to-fiat conversion system is going to completely rethink cross-border transactions as we know them. Read on to learn more about the token. Polygon (POL) Suffers Massive Price Decline As 99% of Polygon's (POL) holders experience price loss, the slide of Polygon toward $0.21 keeps on. Over a 24-hour period, the blockchain lost $13.2 million worth of liquidity, which strengthens forecasts of a continuous downward market trend. Prices have decreased by 34.45% monthly during this time of extreme withdrawal, hence market players are hurrying to identify fresh investment prospects. Polygon's declining price does not exhibit any indication of a transient development. The Artemis data reveals a constant negative flow of money from its chain network, therefore indicating general declining confidence within its network. Most POL token holders now find themselves in a hazardous scenario and run the risk of losing their funds. Open Interest dropped 1.29% in futures markets at the same time trade volume increased by 73% to suggest aggressive short-positioning activity. The technical study shows unfavorabletrends because POL approaches the February key support level. Remittix Is Set To Surge Providing fast and reasonably priced cross-border solutions, Remittix (RTX) is redefining global payments by aggregating FIAT transactions with blockchain technologies. Supported by more than forty cryptocurrencies, the platform provides rapid translations into FIAT currencies like USD and GBP, therefore enabling simple bank account deposits. Remittix is the better alternative to conventional payment providers like Stripe and Wise. As a link between crypto and FIAT, both crypto-exclusive systems like Coinbase Wallet and Remittix guarantee accessibility and inclusivity for companies and people by supporting over 50 crypto pairs and 30+ FIAT currencies, simplifying world trade. Notable also is the platform's open flat-fee approach, which offers savings and transparency over absurd rates of exchange of conventional banks. In the payments industry, Remittix is revolutionary since this approach guarantees that the whole amount transferred reaches the recipient, therefore addressing unethical activity all too often. Why Now Is The Best Time To Buy Remittix At $0.0734 in the presale stage, the RTX coin offers a good investment potential. Forecasts reveal an interesting rise; demand for innovative cross-border payment solutions is generating a 25x multiplier in the presale phase and over 1,500% increases following launch.

Imagine getting into a meme coin early, riding the wave, and cashing out with a life-changing 3650% ROI. The meme market is heating up with the top new meme coins to join in March 2025, and the best part? Some of the biggest gainers of 2025 haven’t even hit the mainstream yet. While everyone scrambles to chase old projects, smart investors are already stacking up presale gems that could explode. BTFD Coin (BTFD) is thriving with a potential moonshot to $0.006, making waves with its Bulls Squad community and high-stakes referral program. Add in the explosive Pudgy Penguins and Peanut the Squirrel, and you’ve got a power trio primed for massive gains. Let’s dive into why these are the top new meme coins to join in March 2025 before the next big pump. 1. BTFD Coin (BTFD) – The 3650% ROI Beast With a Bulls Squad Ready to Charge If you’ve ever missed a life-changing meme coin rally, BTFD is handing you a second chance on a silver platter. This isn’t just another presale—it’s a full-fledged movement built around the legendary Buy The Dip mindset. While the market panics, BTFD holders are buying in, stacking up, and charging straight to the moon with this top new meme coin to join in March 2025. Currently, in its 14th presale stage, BTFD Coin is already making headlines, having raised over $6.32 million with 11,400+ holders locking in their positions. The current price sits at $0.00016, but once the presale ends, BTFD will launch at $0.0006—meaning anyone investing today could triple their money before it even hits exchanges. Now, let’s talk numbers. Suppose you throw in $13,500 at $0.00016 per coin. That bags you 84.375 million BTFD tokens . When BTFD reaches its projected $0.006 moonshot, that stack would be worth a jaw-dropping $506,250! Even if you’re aiming for the short-term, by presale launch at $0.0006, your bag still turns into $50,625—insane gains for an early entry. But BTFD isn’t just about price speculation. The Bulls Squad—featuring Baby Bull, Raging Bull, Nerdy Bull, and Peoples Bull—has created a strong community-driven ecosystem with staking, a 90% APY, and an engaging Play-to-Earn (P2E) game that lets you earn rewards while having fun. The full version of the BTFD game is now live, bringing even more utility and engagement to the project. And if you love making money while doing nothing, BTFD’s Referral Rewards Program lets you earn 10% in BTFD tokens when people use your referral code. If you’re in the top 20 referrers by the end of the month, you’re stacking even more rewards. Why is BTFD shining bright among the top new meme coins to join in March 2025? No meme coin presale right now has this level of community hype, staking rewards, and explosive potential. 2. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) – The NFT King Entering the Meme Coin Space Pudgy Penguins has already cemented itself as an NFT blue-chip, but its entrance into the meme coin world has flipped the script. The project’s expansion from NFTs to crypto tokens is bringing millions of dollars in liquidity, backed by a loyal community of die-hard holders who won’t let it sink. The Pudgy Penguins meme coin is all about interoperability between NFTs and DeFi. Holders can stake, earn, and participate in ecosystem growth while reaping benefits from an already thriving brand. With exclusive NFT integration and limited-edition token airdrops, this is more than just another meme coin—it’s a full-blown Web3 economy. Why does PENGU deserve a spot among the top new meme coins to join in March 2025? Because it’s merging two of crypto’s hottest sectors—NFTs and meme coins—in a way that few have ever pulled off. 3. Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) – The Meme Coin With a Nuts Community If you think meme coins are just a trend, the Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) community is here to prove you wrong. This meme project skyrocketed after its Coinbase listing, and despite market dips, its engagement remains stronger than ever. The secret? A community-first approach with a hilarious, meme-worthy brand that keeps investors engaged. PNUT has built its reputation with interactive community events, staking rewards, and influencer-driven growth. Unlike other meme coins that rely purely on hype, Peanut the Squirrel actually delivers fun utility, and value. From exclusive airdrops to partnerships in the NFT space, PNUT is positioning itself as a long-term player in the meme coin world. Why is PNUT worth watching besides the top new meme coins to join in March 2025? Because while other meme coins fade, this one has a community so strong, that they’d rather hoard PNUT than sell it. Final Thoughts – The Window to Huge Gains is Closing Fast! Meme coins aren’t just for laughs anymore—they’re making life-changing money for early investors. If you’re looking for top new meme coins to join in March 2025, these three are leading the charge. BTFD Coin is already turning heads with its 3650% ROI potential, Pudgy Penguins is breaking boundaries with NFT integration, and Peanut the Squirrel is proving that community-backed projects thrive even in rough markets. But here’s the deal—these opportunities won’t stay at these prices for long. BTFD is already in Stage 14, and once the presale ends, the price jumps to $0.0006. If you want to maximize your gains, now’s the time to get in before the window slams shut. The meme coin boom of 2025 is just getting started, and only those who act fast will be the ones cashing out when the real fireworks begin.

BTFD’s referral program lets users earn 10% in BTFD tokens when someone uses their referral code to invest. If you’re in the top 20 referrers, you get even bigger rewards. The leaderboard resets monthly, so the more you refer, the more you earn! Why is BTFD’s Bulls Squad important for the community? The Bulls Squad is the backbone of BTFD, representing the strongest diamond-hand community in the presale. Baby Bull, Raging Bull, Nerdy Bull, and Peoples Bull, it create a fun, engaging, and community-driven movement rather than just another meme coin. What makes Pudgy Penguins different from other meme coins? Pudgy Penguins isn’t just a meme coin—it’s backed by a blue-chip NFT project with massive brand recognition. It bridges the gap between NFTs and crypto, providing exclusive staking benefits, airdrops, and DeFi integrations. How can Peanut the Squirrel keep its momentum? PNUT thrives on a powerful community, influencer backing, and real utility. With its Coinbase listing, staking rewards, and NFT partnerships, it continues to evolve while keeping investors engaged with regular events and token burns. Is investing in meme coin presales safer than buying after launch? Yes! Presales offer lower entry prices, protect against market volatility, and provide exclusive rewards. BTFD’s presale, for example, lets investors triple their money before listing—a massive advantage over post-launch buyers.

WIF could reach a maximum price of $3.98 by the end of 2028. By 2031, WIF’s price may surge to $6.46. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to the crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins hitting the market afterwards. Dogwifhat has thus far recorded significant feats in terms of valuation and exchange listing. The token approached the $5 mark on March 31, 2024 ($4.58B market cap), saw massive price movements after the November U.S. elections, and got listed on Binance US, Coinbase, KuCoin, Robinhood, and more. However, a massive bear market ensued, and WIF lost momentum. Leaving investors asking: How high can dogwifhat crypto go? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs). Overview Cryptocurrency Dogwifhat Ticker WIF Current price $0.464 Market cap $463,862,590.8 Trading volume $170.73M Circulating supply 998,840,965.85 WIF All-time high $4.85 on March 31, 2024 All-time low $0.000023 on November 2023 24-hour high $0.5022 24-hour low $0.4638 Dogwifhat price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 13.61% 50-day SMA $0.791 14-Day RSI 38.86 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 30 (Fear) Green days 12/30 (30%) 200-Day SMA $1.903 Dogwifhat (WIF) price analysis: WIF sees minor gains, bullish reversal imminent? TL;DR Breakdown WIF shows signs of recovery in the short term but is not yet significant. Dogwifhat (WIF) resistance is present at around $0.528. WIF’s immediate support level is present at $0.429. Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart: WIF faces rejection at $0.528 WIF/USDT is in a downtrend on March 16 after facing rejection at $0.528 on the previous two candlesticks. The MACD is slightly bullish, suggesting potential for a rebound, and the RSI (37.87) shows neutral to oversold condition. If $0.429 holds, a recovery toward $0.528, $0.601 or $0.649 is possible. A breakdown below $0.429 could lead to further declines. WIF faces rejection at $0.528 Dogwifhat price analysis 4-hour chart: WIF to retest $0.492 soon? The 4-hour WIF/USDT shows a clear decline in price, though with some recovery brewing. Dogwifhat currently trades just above the lower Bollinger Band (a short-term support level). A bounce from this level could lead to another attempt at the $0.492 resistance level. WIF to retest $0.492 soon? The MFI reflects a seller-dominated market, while the Balance of Power (BOP) suggests a bullish bias, though not significantly overwhelming the selling pressure. To confirm the position of the BOP indicator, WIF needs to recapture the $0.492 price level and break past resistance at $0.525. Dogwifhat technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.8692 SELL SMA 5 $0.7200 SELL SMA 10 $0.7153 SELL SMA 21 $0.6470 SELL SMA 50 $0.7912 SELL SMA 100 $1.4255 SELL SMA 200 $1.9036 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.6153 SELL EMA 5 $0.7531 SELL EMA 10 $1.0408 SELL EMA 21 $1.4250 SELL EMA 50 $1.9466 SELL EMA 100 $2.21 SELL EMA 200 $2.25 SELL What to expect from WIF price analysis? The broader outlook for WIF is bearish. In the meantime, a recapture and break out of the $0.492 – $0.528 price level is needed to confirm a possible bullish reversal, while a long-term push above $0.649 could signal a sustainable uptrend. A failed bullish attempt could result in further price declines towards $0.395. Is Dogwifhat crypto a good investment? Dogwifhat (WIF) is a meme coin on the Solana blockchain. Its value is driven by community interest and speculation. Projections indicate that by 2025, the price could recover to about $1 to $1.5. While it may have potential for short-term gains, it’s equally risky. Only invest after thorough research. Where to buy WIF? Currently, traders and investors can buy Dogwifhat (WIF) on these CEXs: Binance, Binance.US, Raydium, Coinbase Exchange, Gate.io, KuCoin, Crypto.com Exchange, MEXC, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, LBank and several other s . Why is $WIF down? WIF is down after recently facing rejection at $0.529. The coin is down due to diminishing market interest and folding liquidity triggered by massive selloffs and a shift to other assets that investors consider more profitable. Dogwifhat (WIF) price chart | Coinmarketcap Dogwifhat (WIF) price chart | Coinmarketcap Will WIF reach $10? Having reached a peak price of $4.85 in 2024, the $10 target might not be too far-fetched. Can Dogwifhat reach $100? Dogwifhat (WIF) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and could be unlikely. Its market must be at least $99.9 billion – a value that exceeds the highest market cap ever for a meme (Dogecoin) at $88.79 billion. DOGE’s marketcap history | GlobalData Does WIF have a good long-term future? WIF has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of about $1.2 by the end of 2025 and about $5 to $7 by 2031. However, as with all meme coins, WIF’s future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support.

According to the announcement , the initiative could first be in a three-year experimental regime. The banking institution’s idea is to enable crypto trading for only those Russian investors who have at least 100 million rubles (or $1.1 million) in securities and deposits or whose annual income in the previous year exceeded 50 million rubles (approximately $570,000). The proposal allows entities categorized as qualified investors under current legislation to participate in the experiment. The Bank of Russia also aims to establish certain regulatory requirements for financial organizations willing to adopt cryptocurrency. The introduction of this regime could increase market transparency, offer more opportunities for experienced investors who are open to taking on higher risks, and establish clear standards. In the past, Russia’s central bank has repeatedly warned that cryptocurrencies are not issued or guaranteed by any jurisdiction and are notorious for their enhanced volatility. As such, investors should be aware that entering the ecosystem might result in crucial losses. The banking institution still does not recognize the asset class as a means of payment. That said, it proposed banning transactions between residents involving cryptocurrencies outside the experimental regime and enforcing penalties for violating this rule. On the other hand, multiple reports have emerged since Russia’s ‘special military operation’ against Ukraine that started over three years ago that local firms, as well as the government, are using crypto to bypass Western sanctions.

As Ripple advances its legal battle and files new trademarks, how will XRP markets react in the week ahead? Ripple (XRP) Tumbles 8% to End 4-Day Winning Streak Ripple (XRP) emerged as one of the top-performing assets last week, fueled by renewed optimism in Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). On Thursday, FOX analysts reported that the SEC is considering classifying XRP as a commodity as part of ongoing settlement negotiations to conclude the long-running case against Ripple. The SEC is reportedly using Ethereum’s current regulatory treatment as a benchmark in its deliberations. Ripple (XRP) Price Action | March 16 If this reclassification materialises, it could significantly enhance XRP’s prospects for ETF approval and potential inclusion in a strategic crypto reserve. However, after four consecutive days of green candles for Ripple price , driven by the SEC reclassification speculations, another major regulatory headline appears to have cut the XRP price rally short. Why Is XRP Price Going Down Today? After a four-day winning streak fueled by speculation that the SEC may classify XRP as a commodity, another major SEC announcement appears to have halted the rally. On Friday, March 14, the SEC announced its decision to pause the approval process for altcoin ETFs , triggering a downturn in the prices of top altcoins over the weekend, particularly those with ETF filings in progress. This development partly explains why XRP’s price has now plunged 8%, dropping from its Friday peak of $2.49 to $2.29 as of March 16. Derivatives Market Analysis Flashing Early Rebound Signals Despite the recent price dip, XRP’s derivatives market metrics indicate that bullish sentiment may still be in play. First, the latest Coinglass data shows, XRP’s trading volume has increased by 12.11%, reaching $6.05 billion. This suggests that despite the price pullback, there is still significant market activity. Ripple (XRP) Derivatives Market Analysis | Source: Coinglass Also, the 24-hour liquidation data (Rekt) stands at $11.58 million, with $8.98 million in long positions and $2.60 million in short positions. This suggests that while longs took losses amid the weekend drop, short sellers are now at risk of a squeeze if the price stabilizes. XRP’s open interest has dropped by 6.70% to $3.14 billion, indicating that leveraged positions are unwinding. This could signal the end of the current correction, setting the stage for a fresh uptrend if demand picks up. With strong derivatives volume and long positions outweighing shorts, the market appears to be positioning for a rebound. If broader sentiment improves and regulatory fears subside, XRP could regain momentum in the coming days. 3 Key Events XRP Traders Must Watch in the Week Ahead XRP’s correction phase appears temporary, with derivatives market indicators pointing to sustained bullish momentum. Here are key factors influencing price movements this week: 1. Ripple Files Trademark for New Crypto Wallet Application According to recent media posts , Ripple has reportedly filed for a trademark under the name “RIPPLE CUSTODY,” which hints at a potential new product focused on crypto storage solutions. Ripple Files Trademark for New Cryptocurrency Wallet Application, March 16, 2025 This development could drive fresh investor interest in the week ahead.

U.S. Federal Reserve Decision on February 19 The upcoming Fed meeting will play a crucial role in shaping broader market sentiment.

Strategic investors will keenly watch out for Soundbites, and insights from key ETF sponsors in the coming weeks. XRP Price Forecast: Bulls Eye $2.80 Rebound XRP price forecast suggests a broader crypto market recovery is underway, setting the stage for XRP’s next move. The XRP/USDT daily chart presents a mix of consolidation and volatility, but key technical indicators hint at a potential rebound. The Keltner Channel (KC) midline at $2.35 is acting as immediate resistance, and a breakout above this level could open the door toward the upper KC band near $2.77. XRP Price Forecast The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 47.49 sits in neutral territory, signaling neither overbought nor oversold conditions. However, its recent bounce from 40 suggests growing bullish momentum. A sustained RSI climb above 50 would reinforce the case for continued upside. Despite the recent 8.38% dip in a single session, volume data shows a healthy recovery, with prior bullish days recording over 1.25 billion in volume—a sign that buyers remain engaged. If XRP can maintain support near $2.30, the bulls could regain control, driving prices toward $2.50 in the short term and $2.80 in extension. On the flip side, failure to hold $2.30 could invite deeper retracements, potentially testing the lower KC band near $1.92.

33767162,[object Object],1742169634,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Is The Bitcoin Cycle Peak In? Historical Halving Data Suggests Upside Potential Into Late 2025,https://bitcoinist.com/is-the-bitcoin-cycle-peak-in-historical-halving-data-suggests-upside-potential-into-late-2025/,"Bitcoin is now down over 29% from its all-time high (ATH) in January, and speculation about a coming bear market is growing among investors. After weeks of heavy selling pressure, Bitcoin has entered a consolidation phase, trading between $80K and $85K, with no clear breakout direction yet. Bulls now face a critical test, as they must push BTC above key resistance levels to prevent bears from driving prices lower. If BTC fails to reclaim $85K-$90K, it could lead to another round of selling pressure, sending the price toward lower demand zones. The uncertainty in global markets, combined with macroeconomic headwinds such as inflation concerns, rising interest rates, and trade war fears, has kept investor sentiment fragile. Despite this short-term uncertainty, insights from IntoTheBlock highlight an important historical trend—when analyzing previous Bitcoin halvings, peaks typically occur 12–18 months post-halving, which would point to mid-to-late 2025 as the likely timeframe for this cycle’s top. The big question remains: Is this cycle different? With institutional adoption rising, government policies shifting, and market volatility increasing, analysts are watching closely to determine whether Bitcoin will follow its historical pattern or if external factors will reshape this cycle. The next few months will be crucial in deciding Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory . Historical Halving Trends Suggest More Growth Ahead Bitcoin has been under heavy selling pressure, mirroring the broader struggles of both the crypto market and the US stock market. Macroeconomic uncertainty, trade war fears, and tightening financial conditions have all contributed to weakened investor sentiment, leading to widespread volatility across risk assets. Since the start of the month, Bitcoin has dropped nearly 20%, and the bearish trend appears to be holding. However, despite the short-term weakness, market fundamentals remain strong. Institutional adoption continues to grow, and US President Donald Trump’s plans to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve could serve as a major catalyst for future price movements. Insights from IntoTheBlock on X highlight that when looking at historical Bitcoin halving cycles, peaks tend to occur 12–18 months after a halving event. This pattern suggests that the current cycle’s top could emerge around mid-to-late 2025. While institutional flows and regulatory developments could introduce new variables into this cycle, IntoTheBlock analysts believe there is still time left before Bitcoin reaches its true peak. If historical trends hold, this correction may be a necessary phase before another major rally unfolds. Bitcoin Struggles Below $85K As Bulls Face Critical Resistance Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at $84,200, struggling to regain momentum after days of selling pressure that have kept the price below the $85K mark. Bulls must reclaim the $90K-$91K level to confirm a potential recovery, as this range coincides with the 4-hour 200 moving average (MA) and exponential moving average (EMA)—key technical levels that often signal trend shifts. If BTC can break through this resistance, it could trigger a strong upward move, potentially setting the stage for another push toward all-time highs. However, failure to hold above $85K and reclaim the moving averages could lead to further downside pressure, sending Bitcoin below the $80K mark. With market sentiment still fragile, bulls face a critical test in the coming days. If BTC remains trapped below resistance, selling pressure could intensify, forcing the market into lower demand zones. On the other hand, a decisive breakout above $90K could restore bullish momentum, signaling a potential end to the recent correction phase. The next trading sessions will be crucial in determining Bitcoin’s short-term trajectory.

Trader Ali Martinez tells his 132,900 followers on the social media platform X that whales gobbled up more than $815.514 million worth of ETH in less than a week. “Whales have bought more than 420,000 Ethereum ETH in [five days]!” Source: Ali Martinez/X Martinez is also keeping a close watch on Ethereum’s In/Out of the Money Around Price (IOMAP) metric – which classifies crypto addresses as either profiting, breaking even, or losing money – to determine support and resistance levels for ETH. According to Martinez, ETH is currently trading in a narrow range between stiff support and resistance zones. “Ethereum ETH key levels to watch! On-chain data reveals $1,870 as the strongest support and $2,050 as its toughest resistance!” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, ETH is trading for $1,941. Turning to Bitcoin ( BTC ), the trader believes that the crypto king is poised to witness tactical rallies after breaching the horizontal resistance of an ascending triangle pattern. “Bitcoin BTC is breaking out! The target is $90,000 as long as the $84,000 support holds.” Source: Ali Martinez/X An ascending triangle pattern may be considered a bullish reversal structure if the asset soars above its horizontal resistance. At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $84,288. Turning to Ethereum rival Cardano, the analyst predicts rallies for ADA if the altcoin takes out the diagonal resistance of a triangle pattern at around $0.75. “Cardano ADA is about to break free! Busting out of this triangle will trigger a 15% price move.” Source: Ali Martinez/X A triangle is typically viewed as a consolidation pattern as it signals a potential breakout in either direction. The asset is considered bullish if the price moves above the diagonal resistance and bearish if it tumbles below the diagonal trend line. At time of writing, ADA is worth $0.744.

Participants in Pi Network gained 1000% through early investments since the network had not obtained broad market acceptance at that time. During its early price increase many people overlooked the gemstone and consequently started to doubt whether they would encounter another similar lucrative opportunity. The project Remittixgenerated a presale success rate worth $13.9 million through selling 520 million+ tokens at $0.0734 each. Lessons from Pi Network’s Rapid Rise PI Chart since its inception on February 20, 2025. Source: tradingview Pi Network became known to the public due to its remarkable 1000% growth. The sudden price spike surprised seasoned traders about how quickly altcoins move from small community use to widespread global adoption. Manifesting dramatic value growth serves as evidence for spotting worthwhile cryptocurrency projects when they start at a low level since market performance often leads to unnatural cost elevation. The ability to mine Pi grew popular among crypto users because of its user-friendly mobile platform along with its easy-accessible mining process which allowed more people to participate. The inclusive philosophy of the platform eventually transformed into widespread curiosity which resulted in exceptional price growth. People who did not catch the initial opportunity study alternative coins that demonstrate real market potential for explosive growth. Introducing Remittix: A Real-World Payment Focus The core focus of Remittix lies in delivering instant crypto-to-fiat solutions compared to how Pi depended on community-building and accessibility features. The team seeks to make the process easy for regular people and companies exchanging digital tokens with traditional currencies since it represents a major barrier toward blockchain adoption. The Remittix token features both business utility and simple design elements which help it exceed the role of exchange tokens.The Remittix presale reached recognition when it accepted $13.9 million through the sale of 520 million tokens. Investors recognize the market potential of creating a simple solution between regular currency and cryptocurrency exchanges since new adopters face challenges with difficult steps and variable costs and delayed transactions. Remittix could equal or exceed Pi's value growth by maintaining strategic partnership deals between merchants, remittance services as well as e-commerce platforms. Roadmap Highlights and Potential Catalysts The foundation of Remittix relies heavily on the natural buzz generated by its community members just like Pi Network. As well as building community buzz the initiative develops a regulatory-conscious framework to draw institutional support. Support from bigger organizations would grow through establishing clear legal guidelines with robust oversight mechanisms. The token price can jump rapidly if Remittix completes essential alliances which include facilitating immediate crypto payouts across gig-economy platforms. The future growth of the altcoin directly depends on how it implements its planned expansions. Many projects incur failure after making their expansion too rapid. Remittix will succeed by moving at a controlled speed and providing stable exchanges between crypto assets and demonstrating genuine use examples. The implementation of hyped-driven growth initiatives that extend beyond reasonable capacity boundaries leads to price drops. The token works to protect its clear mission through its focus on rapid settlements to build strong adoption of its users. Conclusion: A Potential Successor to Pi Network’s Leap A profitable launch takes place when token platforms create useful platforms which community support networks accept. The market has received a new promising technology called Remittix which enables digital currency use through standard shopping activities. The continuing success of the presale demonstrates widespread faith in the project from many people. The practical solutions that Remittix delivers create conditions for widespread mainstream adoption of its product even with rapidly changing markets. People who did not secure Pi's 1000% surge now have an opportunity to participate in Remittixgrowth as the project sets course for widespread adoption. Current success in presale indicates the potential for Remittix to become the anticipated breakthrough in cryptocurrency based on its roadmap's expected success and widespread payment demand.

He highlighted five cryptocurrencies: XRP (Ripple), Solana, Cardano (ADA), Bitcoin, and Ethereum. The crypto market, which often reacts strongly to the news, saw a 62% increase in the value of XRP, Solana, and ADA and a 10% rise in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Investing in these coins could be wise, as the administration plans to implement policies and regulations to support their growth. Let's look at them individually and why you should collect them after Trump’s mention. Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin is the first crypto coin released after the Satoshi paper. Despite breaking an all-time price high shortly after Trump’s election victory, it is expected to still rise in value thanks to Trump’s long-term crypto plans. Currently, the United States holds a large amount of BTC and is expected to buy more for its proposed reserve. Bitcoin is often regarded as digital gold because of its scarcity and potential for long-term growth. As a result, it is one of the most highly traded assets in crypto trading . It is also the most liquid coin, which makes it easy to buy and sell. Due to its wide adoption as a mode of payment, it is a great option for you. Bitcoin currently hovers around $86,636.54 as of the time of writing. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum is another cryptocurrency you should consider. It is known for its decentralisation and is second only to Bitcoin regarding market cap. ETH has many use cases, including earning on investments by staking , playing games, and interacting on social media. Its smart-contract characteristics help eliminate the need for intermediaries, a form of security for the coin. With a market capitalisation of about $261.95B and a price range of $2,172.12 per Ethereum, it is expected to attract major investors in light of Trump’s recent speech. The total supply of Ethereum is about 120 million and runs on about 15.8 transactions per second. Thanks to a proof-of-stake mechanism , it is energy efficient and perfect for building Dapps like NFTs and DeFi tokens. These features make ETH a credible addition to your portfolio at the moment. Ripple (XRP) Ripple’s XRP has been on several investors’ radars since former Securities and Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler stepped down. Buying XRP is a smart move due to the tokens' unique properties. It is one of the cryptocurrencies known for its international payment, and it is not mined like other coins; instead, it is obtained through a process known as a unique consensus mechanism. XRP's market capitalisation is about $145 billion, with a price of about $2.50 and a circulating supply of 57 billion. It has very fast translation speeds, and it is used mainly by big financial institutions for payments. Due to its low transaction cost, you could also use XRP for cross-border payments. Solana (SOL) Solana has many profitable prospects, as it has grown by over 11% in recent weeks. It has become a point of interest for savvy crypto investors after being mentioned by the president, and rightly so. It has a total supply of about 595 million Solana with a price tag of about $145.68. Its market capitalisation is about $73 billion, with about 65,000 transactions per second, which makes it very fast and highly scalable. You could also use Solana for the building of NFTs, just like ADA and ETH, and you also don’t have to worry about transaction fees as they are low. Are you thinking of a cryptocurrency that has short and long-term profit prospects? Solana is a good option. Cardano (ADA) Cardano’s ADA has powerful scaling properties, which is one reason you should consider collecting ADA. It was created using Proof of Stake ouroboros, which minimises energy consumption. This coin was launched in September 2017 and has about 35 billion ADA in circulation, with a current price of $0.87. Despite its current valuation per token, which stands at less than a dollar, it has a high propensity for growth in the long run. It has a market capitalisation of about $12.67 billion and plans to achieve about 1 million transactions per second. ADA allows easy interaction with other blockchains and uses smart contracts, which can be used to explore Dapps like NFTs. Criteria To Consider Before Collecting a Coin These five coins mentioned by the president of the US are viable crypto additions to your portfolio. Still, before acquiring them, you must ensure that the coins you acquire are perfect for your needs. Here are tips to help you make the right crypto investment choice: ● Adoption: Analyze how many people adopt the coin and what institution recognises it. A wide adoption can be social proof. ● Market trends: Check for the market trends of the coin you plan to invest in, as it will guide you on how the coin has been performing. Opting for a coin in the top market trend might be a good decision.● Price performance: Knowing the coin's previous and current price can also give you insight into its performance. Even though the price action might not reflect the coin's actual value, it can provide insight into its performance.● Utility: Knowing the coin's utility can help you discern the coin’s actual value. This can be obtained from its use cases. For example, if the coin’s ‘use cases’ improve, the coin will improve. You should also check the regulations governing each coin, as there can be different regulations pertaining to each. Why Now Might Be the Right Time To Invest in These Coins The market growth of the five coins shortly after the speech reflects that investment decisions are already moving towards the coins, and this could be the best time for you to invest in them. However, before you acquire anyone, ensure they have the utility, price performance and adoption that suit your purpose and satisfy your performance criteria.

Alphractal points to the Global Economic Policy Uncertainty Index and the Economic Policy Uncertainty Index for the United States, both of which are nearing their highest levels on record. Historically, such increases in uncertainty have been associated with higher market volatility and, in some cases, economic recessions. The Global Economic Policy Uncertainty Index is a measure of economic policy uncertainty across 20 major economies, taking into account media reports, forecast discrepancies, and tax law changes. A higher index value indicates greater uncertainty that could affect investment decisions, currency fluctuations, and broader financial markets. Related News: Watch Out: 23 Altcoins Have Massive Token Unlocks in the New Week - Here's the Day-by-Day, Hour-by-Hour List Similarly, the U.S. Economic Policy Uncertainty Index assesses uncertainty in the U.S. by analyzing media coverage, tax policy expirations, and changes in economic forecasts. Increases in this index have often preceded periods of economic turmoil and instability. Alphractal warns that increased economic uncertainty could increase volatility across multiple asset classes, including stocks, bonds, and cryptocurrencies. Historical trends suggest that increases in uncertainty often lead to significant market volatility, as seen in past economic crises when both the S&P 500 and Bitcoin (BTC) exhibited significant price swings. According to the analytics company, for cryptocurrency investors, these developments may indicate a period in which price movements will increase and market trends will be unpredictable. *This is not investment advice.

41780857,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=694125,1742171322,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/41780857.jpeg,Solana ($SOL) celebrates 5 years since its official launch,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/solana-sol-celebrates-5-years-since-launch/,"Blockchain platform Solana commemorates its fifth year in the crypto industry since launching in 2020. So far, the network has processed close to $410 billion worth of transactions with a little over 1300 validators. Not to mention, the ecosystem also boasts impressive DEX trading volumes, almost surpassing $1 trillion . Solana’s Gokal encourages the crypto community to launch their own tokens In an X post on March 16, Solana acknowledged its developers and founders who worked hard to build the network and even suggested that the platform has more projects lined up for the crypto community. Co-founder Raj Gokal also commented, leaning towards encouraging developers to introduce their own tokens. He stated, “If we could launch then, you can launch now.” Gokal recalled what was happening on planet Earth at this time five years ago, when everyone around the world was on lockdown and projects, especially crypto, were being cancelled one by one. Anatoly Yakovenko, Solana’s co-founder, also joined in the celebration, wishing all the platform’s enthusiasts worldwide a happy Solana 0 block day. Yakovenko also said that everything was going according to plan, and looking at the characteristics of SOL as a blockchain, few people would argue with this. Solana’s ecosystem still has over $8.5 billion in total value locked in DeFi protocols, having handled more than $408 billion in transactions. Moreover, the network’s fees and revenues are more than double that of Ethereum, and the SOL token has just over $65.5 billion in market cap. SOL could surge past the $300 mark in September 2025 Solana’s price has been under pressure, plunging from $180 in February to current levels below $140. The token’s price slid slightly by 5.67% in the last 24 hours, trading at only $126.83 . The futures market provides a similar snapshot. Funding rates on SOL perpetual futures have been negative for three days, and short sellers are currently paying to hold their positions — an indication of little demand for leveraged long positions. Perhaps more worrying, accumulation has stalled. The total number of Solana wallets holding at least 10,000 SOL fell from 5,053 to 5,023, a signal some large investors may be cashing out or reducing exposure. Analysts believe that SOL has enough room to recover despite steps taken down in the last few days. They even forecast a 10% surge over the next month and a new record by the end of the year. Experts also expect the token’s price to range between $127.50 and $150.14 and have an ROI of 12.76% in the three-month period ending June. They even estimate the token’s average price of $135.99. Some even project that the asset will be trading far above $300 by September 2025. On the other hand, some have estimated prices to oscillate at somewhere between $235.73 and $311.32, with an ROI of at least 133%. Firedancer upgrade set to boost Solana’s speed and stability The next major milestone for Solana’s blockchain is expected to be the launch of Jump Crypto’s Firedancer client—an alternative high-performance validator designed to enhance the network’s transaction throughput and resilience against threats and outages. A testnet version and a prototype mainnet iteration called Frankendancer were introduced in September 2023. Though its launch was originally planned for the second quarter of 2024, Firedancer is widely expected to launch in full this year. Helius co-founder Mert Memtaz, a significant figure in the Solana community, predicted in December that Firedancer will go live “end of Q2.” The upgrade is expected to help Solana scale towards its goal of 1 million transactions per second (TPS). Meanwhile, Solana could also be approved for inclusion in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in 2024. According to The Block’s ETF tracking data, several asset managers have filed for Solana-based ETFs. Analysts have identified Solana—alongside Litecoin, Dogecoin, and XRP—as a strong contender for ETF approval. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

UK Royal Court of Appeal Judge Christopher Nugee knocked back Howells’ application, stating that there was no “real prospect of success” and there was “no other compelling reason” as to why it should be heard, according to a March 13 filing shared with Cointelegraph. Source: James Howells Nugee’s decision follows an earlier dismissal on Jan. 9 from High Court Judge Andrew Keyser, who similarly said there was “no realistic prospect” of Howells’ case succeeding at a full trial. In a note to Cointelegraph, Howell said his “last legal option” to exhaust is at the ECHR — where he will claim that the UK High Court and UK Court of Appeal breached his right to property and right to a fair trial under Article 1 of Protocol 1 and Article 6 of the ECHR. “The British establishment want to sweep this under the carpet, and i will not let them. It will not go away — no matter how long it takes!” The ECHR cannot overrule a UK court decision — however, a verdict in Howells’ favor would call on the UK courts to consider whether its legislation was interpreted in a way that is compatible with the ECHR’s provisions. In a separate statement shared with Cointelegraph, Howells said he would file a claim to the ECHR in the “coming weeks.” The court filings follow repeated rejections from the Newport City Council allowing Howells to search through the Docksway landfill — where Howells’ former partner disposed of a bag containing the hard drive at the site in 2013.

Individuals who ignored it at the right moment regretted missing out on massive profits later on. Remittix (RTX), at present, is on the same journey and offering a revolutionary payment solution on blockchain. RTX offers an actual use-case unlike speculative tokens and ranks as one of the most promising options in the industry right now. As Remittix snowballs along, many think RTX might be the next big star in the digital finance universe. Will traders miss out on another project with enormous adoption prospects yet again, or will RTX eclipse the success of Pi Coin? Pi Coin’s Journey: A Lesson in Missed Opportunities The current Pi Coin (PI) price is $1.45, a drop of 0.83%. Despite the drop in value, Pi Coin has attained a market cap of $10.06 billion, an indicator that risk-taking early investors are being rewarded. Source: Tradingview It nevertheless had a skeptical reception at launch and most people dismissed it as another experiment. It grew its network in due course of time and those who invested early reaped an immense profit from it. Unfortunately, most people didn't appreciate its rise to success and only noticed its value when it was too late. Now that Remittix (RTX) begins to ascend, investors are observing closely, determined not to make the same mistake. Why Remittix (RTX) Could Be the Next Big Crypto Remittix (RTX) is in the news as a blockchain-based financial platform that provides fee-free and real-time cryptocurrency-fiat transactions. RTX currently trades at $0.0734 and raised $13.9 million and sold 520 million tokens, reflecting strong investor interest. Compared to Pi Coin, which built its network through mobile mining, RTX is being built with use in the real world in mind. A US-based freelancer who does work for clients in Europe, for instance, can use RTX to receive payment instantly, avoiding banking commissions and settlement times. RTX is consequently a practical financial tool rather than a speculative vehicle. PayFi model of RTX provides a new standard in cryptocurrency payments and finds itself as one of the most promising blockchain payment prospects out there. Can Remittix (RTX) Outperform Pi Coin? The popularity of Pi Coin demonstrates blockchain innovations' potential for mass adoption, but Remittix (RTX) has something even better—actual use cases in the real world. While Pi Coin's development falls behind, RTX is seeing real-world adoption and is thus a high-growth investment opportunity. Unlike speculative meme coins or projects with questionable use cases, RTX is solving a global financial problem. Businesses, freelancers, and merchants are turning to RTX for seamless digital payments, and that's what's fueling its growing adoption. As the use of cryptocurrency keeps on increasing, the chances of RTX surpassing Pi Coin in market cap and growth in value improve by the day. With increasing use of cryptocurrency, RTX could be one of the largest winners in 2025. Why Now Is the Best Time to Invest in RTX Investors who missed Pi Coin’s early rise are now looking at Remittix (RTX) as a second chance. With its crypto-to-fiat payment system, RTX is attracting serious attention from investors and businesses alike. Unlike other speculative assets, RTX offers real-world financial applications, making it one of the most promising blockchain investments today. As more companies integrate crypto payments, RTX’s value is expected to rise significantly. For those looking for the next big opportunity, RTX presents a rare chance to get in early before mainstream adoption takes off. Invest in the Future of Blockchain Payments with Remittix (RTX) With Remittix gaining momentum, many investors are turning to RTX as the next major force in blockchain finance. Its focus on instant, low-cost transactions makes it a strong alternative to traditional banking systems. Pi Coin taught investors that early adoption in promising blockchain projects can lead to massive gains. Now, RTX is proving to be the next major opportunity in crypto payments. As blockchain adoption accelerates, RTX is positioning itself as a leader in financial technology, making it one of the most exciting crypto investments of the decade.

With institutional interest growing and regulatory clarity improving, XRP’s bullish momentum is building fast. But it’s not the only token poised for exponential gains Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a high-potential DeFi contender, attracting early investors with its innovative tokenomics and staggering growth projections. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), is gaining momentum and may hit that benchmark first. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) shows strong performance growth in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector through its dual-lending model innovation. The third phase of Mutuum Finance presale continues while this high-growth altcoin sells for $0.02 and has collected $3.2 million. The next stage of the presale will boost MUTM’s price to $0.025 while attracting more than 5500 investors while simultaneously raising funds to $0.03 million. The initial investors during this phase will receive a 200% payback when the launch price reaches $0.06 while future forecast estimates predict a value surge past $5 in the near future. A DeFi Giant on the Rise Mutuum Finance pushes forward decentralized lending through dual lending while promoting mass adoption because of its transformative structure. More than 5,700 investors joined the presale funding to support the project which received $3.4 million in total. Mutuum Finance’s price currently reaches $0.02 in Phase 3 even though investors anticipate a 25% price increase in Phase 4 which will generate considerable profit potential. The analysts forecast MUTM to surge beyond $5 in upcoming months when it launches at $0.06 because its distinctive lending approach meets rising market requirements thus making it an underappreciated yet promising DeFi resource. The Dual-Model System for Enhanced DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance transforms DeFi lending through the combination of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending systems. Through the P2C model users can achieve passive income by lending their USDT through liquidity pools that operate automatically through smart contracts. The P2P model provides transactions which operate without intermediaries allowing users to personally manage their assets through direct deals. Mutuum Finance unites P2C and P2P lending methods to secure and streamline its decentralized operation thus creating profitable opportunities for investors looking to maximize yield in DeFi.

In several examples posted to X, the email claims to be from Coinbase, asking users to transition to self-custodial wallets and providing instructions on downloading the legitimate Coinbase Wallet, giving a deadline of April 1 to make the switch. Source: Steve Kaczynski However, it also provides pre-generated recovery phrases . Once users open a new wallet with those phrases and transfer funds, all the assets will be available to the threat actor, who could drain the wallet. The email mentions a class-action lawsuit against Coinbase alleging it has sold unregistered securities, which has resulted in a court mandating users manage their own wallets. “Coinbase will operate as a registered broker, allowing purchases, but all assets must move to Coinbase Wallet,” the phony email says. The US Securities and Exchange Commission dismissed its lawsuit alleging Coinbase was an unregistered broker and selling unregistered securities on Feb. 27. Coinbase told Cointelegraph it is aware of the scam and pointed to its March 14 post to X, saying , “We will never send you a recovery phrase, and you should never enter a recovery phrase given to you by someone else.” Source: Coinbase Support Crypto exchange Gemini has also been spoofed with the same recovery phrase email scam, using the same tactics and claiming users need to set up a new wallet because of a recent court decision. Gemini was being sued by the SEC for allegedly offering unregistered securities through its earn program. The regulator opted to end the legal action on Feb. 26.

Arizona federal court Judge Douglas Rayes on March 13 granted the CFTC’s earlier motion for summary judgment in its case and ordered Debiex to pay back around $2.26 million it stole from its customers, along with a civil penalty of nearly $221,500. Judge Rayes said there was no evidence that Debiex’s failure to respond to the CFTC was the result of “excusable neglect.” The CFTC sued Debiex in January 2024, saying its staff ran a so-called “pig butchering” scam , where they initiated romantic relationships with customers over social media to gain trust to convince them to invest in the platform. The scheme hooked five victims who deposited around $2.3 million in total onto Debiex, which the purported trading platform stole, the CFTC said. A highlighted excerpt of Judge Rayes’ order summarizing the CFTC’s case against Debiex, Source: CourtListener The CFTC also accused Zhāng Chéng Yáng of being a “money mule” for Debiex, whose crypto wallets were used to accept and steal victims’ funds. Judge Rayes granted a CFTC motion for default judgment against Zhāng on March 12, finding it adequately alleged he controls a crypto wallet with OKX “that received digital assets to which he had no legitimate claim.” He said OKX was “voluntarily preserving” the crypto in Zhāng’s account and ordered its contents, consisting of $5.70 worth of Tether ( USDT ) and nearly 63 Ether ( ETH ) worth around $119,500, to be transferred to an unnamed victim. The CFTC said in its January 2024 complaint that Debiex’s scheme saw its unknown managers target potential victims through social media to lure them to websites it had created marketing itself as a “Blockchain Network Decentralized perpetual contract trading platform” where users can conduct futures trading and “Mining transactions.” Related: Four suspects charged in home invasion of streamer Amouranth Debiex’s staff would present as females and built a rapport with victims through “continuous and repeated messaging and sharing purported pictures of themselves” while claiming to be “highly successful digital asset commodities traders,” the CFTC said. Once an account was created and the customers sent over their crypto, the CFTC said Debiex would share “fictitious information” about customer balances, trading positions and profits. “All of this information was most likely false,” the CFTC said. “The evidence shows that the Customers’ digital assets were simply sent to numerous digital asset wallets in an attempt to obfuscate their destination.” Magazine: SEC’s U-turn on crypto leaves key questions unanswered",,EN,0,0,TRADING|USDT|BLOCKCHAIN|COMMODITY|ETH,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-03-17 02:11:07

Qubetics’ Presale Boom Puts It Ahead While AAVE and Ethereum Keep Dominating 2025,https://timestabloid.com/best-coins-to-buy-today-qubetics-presale-boom-puts-it-ahead/,"If you’re looking to invest in the best coins to buy today , Qubetics, AAVE, and Ethereum should definitely be on your radar. As the cryptocurrency market continues to heat up, these three coins are catching the eye of both casual crypto enthusiasts and seasoned professionals. Each of these projects brings something innovative to the table, with the potential to shape the future of blockchain, decentralized finance, and digital transactions. Qubetics, a rising star in the crypto world, has already made waves with its decentralized VPN and interoperability solutions, making it one of the most exciting tokens to watch in 2025. Ethereum continues to dominate the blockchain space with its Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, which promises to solve scalability issues while maintaining its position as the go-to platform for decentralized applications (dApps). Meanwhile, AAVE is still a powerhouse in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, revolutionizing how users borrow and lend digital assets. Qubetics: The Interoperable Blockchain Solution You Didn’t Know You Needed When it comes to the best coins to buy today, Qubetics is undeniably a standout. The project isn’t simply riding the wave of blockchain hype; it’s making a significant impact with its innovative solutions, particularly in interoperability and decentralized privacy. Let’s explore why Qubetics deserves your attention. Solving Blockchain’s Interoperability Challenge What is Interoperability? Interoperability refers to the ability of different blockchain networks to communicate and work together seamlessly. In today’s blockchain world, without this capability, users are left within isolated ecosystems that have limited functionality and cause friction between platforms. Qubetics’ Cross-Chain Protocol: Qubetics is addressing this major issue by offering a cross-chain interoperability protocol. This protocol enables different blockchains, whether Ethereum-based or others, to work together effortlessly. Why It Matters: This makes it easier for businesses, professionals, and individuals to operate across multiple blockchain systems without the usual barriers. Whether it’s integrating decentralized apps (dApps) or leveraging blockchain solutions for various use cases, Qubetics is paving the way for greater efficiency in the ecosystem. Decentralized VPN (dVPN): The Future of Online Privacy One of Qubetics’ most exciting features is its decentralized VPN (dVPN). In a world where data privacy and security are top concerns, Qubetics offers a solution that eliminates the need to trust centralized VPN providers. Unlike traditional VPNs that rely on centralized servers, Qubetics’ decentralized VPN means there’s no single point of failure, offering a much higher level of security and privacy. For businesses, this service ensures that sensitive data remains protected, while individuals can enjoy a safe online experience, free from surveillance or hacking threats. Qubetics’ Strong Growth and Community Support Ongoing crypto Presale Success: As of now, Qubetics is in its 26th presale stage, having raised over $15 million from more than 23,000 holders. The presale has sold over 499 million tokens, demonstrating strong community support and investor interest. Attractive Investment Opportunity: With the presale price of $0.1181 per $TICS token, Qubetics offers an exciting entry point for those looking to invest before the project’s mainnet launch. AAVE: Decentralized Finance for the People Another project that has consistently been a top choice for anyone looking to buy the best coins today is AAVE. When you think of decentralized finance (DeFi), AAVE should be at the top of your list. AAVE is one of the most well-known protocols in the DeFi space, offering decentralized lending and borrowing services. It allows users to lend their assets to earn interest or borrow assets with no middleman involved, all while utilizing smart contracts to ensure security and transparency. AAVE is unique because of its flash loans—unsecured loans that must be paid back within the same transaction block. This innovative feature enables users to access liquidity without needing collateral, making it a game-changer for traders and developers looking to access capital quickly. These flash loans have helped AAVE build a strong reputation as a protocol that caters to both seasoned crypto enthusiasts and newcomers alike. Ethereum: The Backbone of Decentralized Applications and Smart Contracts It’s impossible to talk about the best coins to buy today without mentioning Ethereum. Ethereum has been the cornerstone of the blockchain ecosystem for years, and its role is only becoming more critical with the ongoing Ethereum 2.0 upgrade. Ethereum 2.0 aims to solve some of the major issues faced by Ethereum’s original version, including scalability, energy efficiency, and transaction costs. The transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) will reduce energy consumption by over 99%, addressing one of the biggest concerns surrounding Ethereum’s environmental impact. One of Ethereum’s most powerful features is its ability to support smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). This has made Ethereum the go-to platform for developers looking to build decentralized solutions in areas like DeFi, gaming, and NFTs. The Ethereum ecosystem is massive, and its dominance in the blockchain space is unlikely to fade any time soon. Conclusion: Why Qubetics, AAVE, and Ethereum Are the Best Coins to Buy Today When considering the best coins to buy today, it’s clear that Qubetics , AAVE, and Ethereum are leading the charge. Whether you’re looking for innovative interoperability solutions, a DeFi protocol that makes borrowing and lending easier, or a blockchain that powers decentralized applications, these three coins have it all. Qubetics offers an exciting opportunity with its cross-chain interoperability and decentralized VPN, while AAVE continues to redefine decentralized finance with its cutting-edge features. Ethereum remains the backbone of the blockchain industry and is poised for even greater success with Ethereum 2.0. These projects are not just about the present—they are about shaping the future of blockchain. If you’re looking to get ahead in 2025, these are the best coins to buy today. Don’t miss out on the chance to be a part of the next big wave in crypto!

Some investors capitalize early, while others look back with regret, wishing they had seized the moment. One of the most infamous “missed ICO” stories in crypto history is that of Binance Coin (BNB). Back in its early days, many overlooked its potential, only to watch it surge in value beyond their wildest expectations. But for those who feel they missed out, a new chance is on the horizon— Arctic Pablo Coin is making waves in its presale, and the opportunity it presents is strikingly similar to Binance Coin’s early days. The Numbers Speak: Arctic Pablo Coin’s Explosive ROI Potential Just like early Binance Coin investors, those who jump into Arctic Pablo Coin at this stage have a massive upside ahead. The projected launch price of Arctic Pablo Coin is set at $0.008, meaning early investors could experience an ROI of over 10,694.59%.To put it into perspective: a $500 investment now secures 6,756,520 APC tokens. When Arctic Pablo Coin lists at its launch price, that same investment will be worth a staggering $54,052.16. Those who hesitated during Binance Coin’s ICO watched others become millionaires while they stood on the sidelines. Arctic Pablo Coin offers a chance to rewrite that story. With its booming presale, strong community incentives, and exceptional growth potential, this could be the defining investment of 2025. In short, Arctic Pablo Coin is the top crypto coin to invest in 2025. Binance Coin’s Early Days: The Opportunity That Got Away When Binance Coin launched in July 2017, it was just another exchange token. The initial coin offering (ICO) priced BNB at a mere $0.15 per token. At that time, the market was flooded with new coins, and many investors were skeptical. Some saw Binance Coin as nothing more than an exchange utility token with limited potential. Others simply hesitated, unsure whether it was worth the risk. Fast forward to today, and those early doubts have turned into deep regret. Binance Coin has skyrocketed, reaching an all-time high of over $690. The investors who had the foresight to buy BNB during its ICO have seen astronomical returns. A mere $500 investment in Binance Coin during the ICO would now be worth millions. Hindsight is a cruel teacher. Those who ignored BNB’s early promise have spent years watching its meteoric rise, kicking themselves for not taking the plunge. But in the crypto world, second chances are rare—and Arctic Pablo Coin is shaping up to be the next golden opportunity for those looking to turn back time.

Arctic Pablo Coin shines as the top crypto coin with its innovative approach, rewarding community engagement, and an impressive presale performance. Currently, Arctic Pablo Coin is in the Frosty Falls phase (14th stage) of its presale, with tokens priced at $0.000074 each. Over $1.88 million has already been raised, proving that investors are recognizing its potential. But what truly sets Arctic Pablo Coin apart is its robust referral incentives—a system that allows investors to spread the word and earn rewards, ensuring organic and community-driven growth.

Reports suggest that President Donald Trump’s team is eyeing XRP as a key player in building a powerhouse Bitcoin (BTC) reserve. A new proposal submitted to the US SEC suggests that XRP could play a key role in boosting the US financial system. The plan claims that integrating XRP could unlock $1.5 trillion in liquidity, which could then be used to buy Bitcoin. However, this idea faces major regulatory hurdles, and it remains unclear if the government will take it seriously. How XRP Could Free Up Trapped Funds The five page proposal written by Maximilian Staudinger suggests that the US should consider using XRP to free up capital stuck in Nostro accounts. These accounts, used for cross-border transactions, hold about $27 trillion globally, with around $5 trillion belonging to US banks. By using XRP, Staudinger believes that $1.5 trillion could be released and redirected toward Bitcoin purchases. Staudinger also proposes a structured crypto reserve system for the US. He argues that Bitcoin should be at the center, while Solana and Cardano could be used for government applications. However, he insists that XRP is the most important asset for handling financial transactions. Bold Bitcoin Claims Raise Questions One of the more questionable parts of the proposal is the claim that the US could buy 25 million Bitcoin at $60,000 per coin. This is impossible since Bitcoin’s total supply is only 21 million. Still, the proposal argues that using XRP could save the US up to $7.5 billion in transaction fees annually and make government payments, like Social Security and tax refunds, faster and cheaper. Regulatory Challenges Stand in the Way Despite its ambitious plan, the proposal faces a big setback—XRP’s unclear regulatory status. Staudinger urges the SEC to classify XRP as a payment asset instead of a security. He also calls on the Department of Justice to lift restrictions preventing banks from using XRP. To speed things up, he suggests a presidential executive order to bypass regulatory delays. His plan includes two timelines: a standard 24-month rollout with standard regulatory approval, government payments, and bank adoption, or opting for a fast-track 6-12 month timeline using executive orders and Fed mandates for quick XRP integration. While ambitious, the fast-track approach could work given Ripple’s existing global liquidity network. Will This Proposal Go Anywhere? While the idea sounds interesting, independent proposals like this usually don’t gain much traction unless backed by major financial institutions or government officials. Without strong support, this remains a bold idea rather than a plan the US is likely to adopt anytime soon.",News|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,XRP|BTC|REGULATION|FIAT|ADA,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-17 03:04:36

According CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost’s latest market analysis post on X, on Jan. 17, Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) open interest hit a record $33 billion, signaling extreme leverage in the market. However, political uncertainty tied to former U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent actions led to a wave of liquidations. https://twitter.com/darkfost_coc/status/1901368698868473975?s=46&t=nznXkss3debX8JIhNzHmzw Subsequently, nearly $10 billion in open interest vanished between Feb. 20 and Mar. 4. This sharp decline pushed Bitcoin’s 90-day futures open interest change down to -14%, often signaling market resets before price recoveries. Analysts believe that eliminating excessive speculation, these stages provide a more stable basis for future growth. You might also like: “What we’re seeing now is looking just like March 2017”. Analysts explain why Bitcoin could soon recover — or crash harder Bitcoin’s long-term outlook is still optimistic despite the decline. According to economist Timothy Peterson, April and October are usually when Bitcoin experiences the biggest seasonal gains. Peterson’s most recent analysis reveals that Bitcoin might hit new all-time highs before June, with a median target of $126,000. Bitcoin is trading near the low end of its historical seasonal range. Nearly all of Bitcoin's annual performance occurs in 2 months: April and October. It is entirely possible Bitcoin could reach a new all-time high before June. pic.twitter.com/p8upTNAkKH — Timothy Peterson (@nsquaredvalue) March 15, 2025 In addition, his “Lowest Price Forward” model, which estimates a price level that Bitcoin is unlikely to drop below in future trading, indicates that Bitcoin’s price floor has now risen to $69,000, with a 95% chance of holding. Past bull markets have shown that corrections like Bitcoin’s recent 30% pullback often precede strong rebounds. However, not all analysts are fully bullish. Benjamin Cowen, founder of Into The Cryptoverse, warned on a Mar. 15 YouTube stream that Bitcoin’s bull cycle could be in jeopardy if it drops below the 2024 highs, which is in the lower $70,000s. Cowen compares the current cycle to 2017 when Bitcoin retested the prior year’s high. He suggests the bull market might be over if Bitcoin closes in the low $60,000s. Additionally, according to Cowen, holding above $70,000–$73,000 would maintain the market’s structure. Bitcoin may signal a macro lower high later in the year if it drops below this level, which could result in a more bearish outlook by Q3. Bitcoin is still in a crucial consolidation phase , with its current price at $82,900 at the time of press. If past trends hold, this reset could pave the way for another strong rally in the coming months.

Regional news outlets have been busy reporting in recent months on the manifold troubles facing the event, set to be a cashless endeavor and featuring its own so-called “Web3” wallet. A big part of the cashless and the “Web3” promotion of Expo 2025 has been the official wallet app of the event. Wallet users who log-in every month will receive an SBT (“Soulbound Token”) — as well as another non-fungible token (NFT) commemorating the 1970 Osaka World Expo. Expo 2025’s repulsive mascot dressed as Santa Claus drew disapproval from Japanese users of social media platform X. The site notes: “Even before the Expo officially begins, you can join the Expo-related services and events through the ‘Connect Feature’, which is linked to Web3 Wallets and the SBT Digital Passport.” Attendees are also made aware they can pay by mere facial recognition, should they register their biometric data with the wallet. Aside from heavy promotion of cashless payments (indeed, there will be no cash options inside the expo), the expo’s digital wallet, which does not feature the ability to pay with any actually decentralized or private peer-to-peer cryptocurrency, is being leveraged to sell the United Nations’ controversial Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) initiative (one intiative of which is actual insect-food vending machines placed in Japan , to help fight overpopulation and climate change, so-called.). “Earn unique points by participating in various SDGs and the EXPO initiatives, and by exchanging other points!” the wallet’s website states. Cryptopolitan reached out to event organizers regarding event difficulties and the Expo 2025 Digital Wallet, but at time of writing, no response has been received. Cashless Expo 2025’s mascot Myaku-Myaku grosses-out public “No matter how you dress it up, I just can’t stand it.” “Disgusting.” “I’m sorry, but it just looks like a monster to me.” These are just a few of the reactions to the expo’s mascot, “Myaku-Myaku,” on an X post from last November. Japanese X users speculate on Expo 2025 as a potential center for disease. The Japanese portion reads in part (translated): “Do not go near people who went to the Osaka Expo. People who went to the Osaka Expo are infected with a new virus.” Expo 2025’s official website describes the character as “a mysterious creature born from the fusion of cells and water,” elaborating: “The red part represents ‘cells,’ which divide and multiply … [and] the blue part represents ‘pure water,’ which can flow and change shape.” If you think a description of the onomatapoeic Japanese “myaku-myaku” might ease your mind about the character somehow relating to genetic mutation, you might be wrong. The official site clarifies: “Our human DNA, wisdom, technology, history and culture have been passed down “myaku-myaku” (continuously) from generation to generation.” The term, notably, can also mean “pulsating.” Some Japanese are even speculating , controversially, that the Expo’s self-decribed “People’s Living Lab” may be just that: a center of some kind of new disease. Public upset with the expo’s confusing ticketing system and construction Kyodo News reported on March 13 that the projected three-trillion-yen impact (about $20 billion USD) of the expo may fail to be realized due to poor ticket sales and delays in construction. Though the original target was to sell 14 million tickets, as of March 5, the number of tickets sold reportedly stood at a mere 8 million. Hiroyuki Ishige, a leader of the Japan Association for the 2025 World Exposition, acknowledged that the goal was “extremely ambitious.” The ‘Grand Ring’ where Expo 2025 will be held in Osaka, Japan. Source: OBAYASHI CORPORATION/Expo 2025. The late introduction of new ticket types, and reduced prices for season passes added just last month, have some would-be attendees giving up altogether on going, and others demanding refunds . Further complicating preparations are major delays in construction, with the Kyodo report noting only about 20% of “Type A self-built pavilions,” considered to be the main attraction, have been completed. There have also been problems reported with foreign participants not completing interior displays by the suggested March 13 date. For now, Japanese are left to wonder if is there real trouble afoot at the artificial “ Yumeshima ” (roughly translated “Dream Island/Continent”) location.

In a response to a written inquiry from Rep. Cha Gyu-geun of the Democratic Party of Korea on March 16, the BOK opened up about the need for caution when considering Bitcoin as part of the country’s financial assets. This marks the first time the BOK has officially addressed the issue. According to Korea Economic TV, the central bank cited Bitcoin’s extreme price volatility as a major concern. The price of Bitcoin has seen sharp fluctuations recently, soaring to 160 million won in January, before falling to 110 million won. Despite predictions of potential future growth, some experts warn that Bitcoin’s value could drop to zero at any time. The BOK explained that such instability could lead to increased transaction costs when converting Bitcoin into cash, particularly during periods of market turmoil. Additionally, the bank pointed out that Bitcoin does not meet the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) standards for foreign exchange reserves. According to the IMF, foreign exchange reserves must be liquid, marketable, and expressed in a convertible currency with a high credit rating. The Bank of Korea further stated that, to date, no discussions or reviews have taken place regarding Bitcoin’s inclusion in reserves. They said, “There has been no discussion or review of Bitcoin’s inclusion in foreign exchange reserves so far. It is known that some countries, such as the Czech Republic and Brazil, have expressed positive opinions, but the European Central Bank ( ECB ), the Swiss National Bank, and the Japanese government have expressed negative opinions.” This announcement comes amid broader global debates, with U.S. President Donald Trump recently signing an executive order for a strategic Bitcoin stockpile, although this would involve only Bitcoin seized through legal processes, not new federal purchases.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|ASIA|EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-17 03:35:25

Officials from the Korean central bank said in a March 16 response to a written inquiry that they have not looked into a potential Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve, citing high volatility. Responding to a question from Representative Cha Gyu-geun of the National Assembly’s Planning and Finance Committee, central bankers said that they have “neither discussed nor reviewed the possible inclusion of Bitcoin in foreign exchange reserves, adding that “a cautious approach is needed,” according to the Korea Herald. “Bitcoin’s price volatility is very high,” the central bank noted, before adding that “in the case of cryptocurrency market instability, transaction costs to cash out Bitcoins could rise drastically.” Over the past 30 days, Bitcoin prices have swung wildly between $98,000 and $76,000 before settling at current levels of around $83,000 in a 15% decline since Feb. 16, according to CoinGecko. The decision comes amid increasing global discussions on the role of crypto assets in national financial strategies, sparked by US President Donald Trump’s executive order earlier this month establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve and digital asset stockpile. At a seminar on March 6, crypto industry lobbyists, and some members of Korea’s Democratic Party urged the country to integrate Bitcoin into its national reserves and develop a won-backed stablecoin. However, the Bank of Korea emphasized that its foreign exchange reserves must have liquidity and be immediately usable when needed, as well as a credit rating of investment grade or higher, criteria that Bitcoin does not meet, in its opinion. Professor Yang Jun-seok of Catholic University of Korea concurred, stating “it is appropriate for foreign exchange to be held in proportion to the currencies of countries with which we trade,” Professor Kang Tae-soo from the KAIST Graduate School of Finance commented on the US being likely to leverage stablecoins rather than BTC to maintain dollar hegemony before adding, “Whether the IMF will recognize stablecoins as foreign exchange reserves in the future is important.” Related: Democrat lawmaker urges Treasury to cease Trump’s Bitcoin reserve plans Earlier this month, South Korea’s financial regulator examined the Japanese Financial Services Agency’s legislative trend toward crypto assets as it mulls lifting a ban on crypto exchange-traded funds in the country.

Support Levels to Watch Currently, XRP is testing an important support zone between $2.25 and $2.30. As of now, the price is holding steady within this range. If it successfully bounces from here, it could set up a short-term bullish trend. A confirmed bounce could push XRP up toward the next resistance levels between $2.65 and $2.80. However, resistance at $2.50 might slow down the momentum. What If XRP Breaks Support? On the other hand, if XRP fails to hold support and the price falls below $2.25, it would indicate a potential retracement toward the next critical support area, around $1.95 to $2.05. This price action would align with the larger sideways trend XRP has been in for the past several weeks. Looking Ahead: What Could Happen? Looking at the broader picture, XRP is still holding within a sideways range between $1.20 and $2.80. This range suggests the price may experience more choppy and unpredictable movements. While some analysts are hopeful for a breakout, XRP has not shown any clear signs of a strong bullish impulse, particularly as it continues to struggle below major resistance levels. In terms of long-term price targets, if the market starts to show positive momentum, the $5 to $5.65 range could be possible, but this depends heavily on the market maintaining the critical $2 support level. A decisive break below this support could signal a bearish scenario, pushing XRP lower into the support range and possibly leading to a more significant correction.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|ALTCOIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-17 04:09:07

Popular economist Peter Schiff believes that if Nasdaq enters the bear market correcting 40% from the peak, BTC price can collapse all the way to $20K. NASDAQ Decline and Bitcoin Price Correlation Amid the brutal US stock market correction over the last few weeks, the NASDAQ index is down by 12%. Economist Peter Schiff believes that things could turn brutal for BTC if the correction slips further into a bear market. The Bitcoin price shares a historical correlation with Nasdaq. A 12% NASDAQ decline often equates to a 24% drop in Bitcoin, placing it at approximately $65,000. If the NASDAQ continues to drop by 20%, Bitcoin could align at $55,000. However, Schiff added that Nasdaq has historically seen even greater corrections while slipping into the bear market territory. The economist stated that during the Dot-com bubble, the NASDAQ fell nearly 80%, while it declined 55% during the 2008 financial crisis and 30% during the COVID crash in 2020. Considering an average 55% decline, Schiff believes that even a 40% drop in Nasdaq index could push BTC price lower to $20,000. “A drop of this magnitude would likely accelerate Bitcoin’s collapse to much lower levels,” Schiff stated . However, Peter Schiff is not alone in predicting a Bitcoin price crash to such lower levels. Last week, Bloomberg analyst Mike McGlone predicted a BTC crash to $10K , while Gold has been on a very strong upside rally. For the near term, all eyes will be on the upcoming US Fed decision following the cooling US inflation data for the month of February. Traders are positioning themselves for the same with a strong surge in daily trading volumes. Gold’s Negative Correlation With Nasdaq In contrast to Bitcoin, gold has shown a negative correlation with the NASDAQ. Since the NASDAQ peaked on December 16, 2023, gold has risen 13%, demonstrating an inverse relationship. Economist Peter Schiff stated that if the NASDAQ undergoes a 40% decline, gold could soar past $3,800. These gains could further extend if the bear market leads to a significant decline in the US Dollar, says Schiff. At $3,800 gold and $20,000 Bitcoin, Schiff projected Bitcoin’s value in terms of gold would plunge over 85%, challenging Bitcoin’s narrative as a store of value. Schiff Predicts US Might Give Up On Bitcoin Reserve Plans The economist stated that the divergence in the value of Bitcoin price and Gold could challenge the cryptocurrency’s status as “digital gold”. Thus, Peter Schiff believes that this could further push away the governments or ETF investors to hold Bitcoin in reserves. He added that massive selling pressure would make it “impossible” for companies like MicroStrategy to liquidate enough Bitcoin to avoid financial distress. Over the past weekend, Bitcoin and the broader crypto markets haven’t shown much of a movement. As press time, Bitcoin is trading 0.66% down at $83,742 with its daily trading volume up by 79% to more than $23.21 billion.

The dispute, which began under the Biden administration, has raised questions about the future of the cryptocurrency. According to Fox News, the delay in reaching a final agreement is due to Ripple negotiating more favorable terms related to a district court ruling that imposed a $125 million fine on the company. The ruling also included a permanent injunction preventing Ripple from selling XRP tokens to institutional investors. Legal expert Jeremy Hogan suggested that a private settlement with the SEC could bring the lawsuit to an end without the need for a court battle. Hogan stated that if a settlement is reached, the case could be wrapped up in a matter of days, providing much-needed clarity for Ripple and the broader market. This would allow Ripple to move forward, giving institutions the green light to engage with XRP and ushering in a new era for the cryptocurrency. Hogan had previously said, “The only way the case could “be over” soon is if Ripple and the SEC reach a private settlement agreement (which would vary from the judgment), dismiss the appeal, and then simply never take the terms of the settlement agreement back to the trial court to be ratified. This is possible but, assuming the injunction is the sticking point, the SEC would have to agree not to enforce the Court’s injunction.” To my knowledge they never have. I assume it’s a legal requirement but it’s one of those things so built into the process that nobody questions it. — Marc Fagel (@Marc_Fagel) March 15, 2025 However, former SEC lawyer Marc Fagel pointed out that there is no such thing as a “private” settlement with the SEC. All SEC settlements are public and must be reviewed by a court. Fagel added that while it may seem like a routine process, it is legally required for transparency and oversight.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-17 04:54:13

Still, a crypto whale has taken a contrarian stance by raising a leveraged bearish bet on BTC worth millions on Hyperliquid while betting bullish on the MELANIA token. As of writing, the whale held a short position in BTC perpetual futures worth over $445 million, generating an unrealized gain of $1.3 million. The position employed a 40x leverage and a liquidation price of $86,000, according to data source Hyperliquid and Lookonchain . The outsized short anticipating a bitcoin price slide made waves on social media X on Sunday as pseudonymous trader CBB invited other market participants for a consortium of bulls aimed at liquidating the whale. ""11 hours ago, @Cbb0fe publicly formed a team to hunt this whale who shorted $BTC with 40x leverage. Just one hour later, the team was in action, driving $BTC above $84,690 in a short period,"" blockchain sleuth Lookonchain said on X. ""The whale was forced to deposit $5M USDC to increase margin and avoid liquidation. But the hunt ultimately failed,"" Lookonchain added. As of writing, the crypto whale also held a 5x leveraged long position in the MELANIA perpetual futures, anticipating a price rise in the memecoin reportedly marketed by MKT World LLC, a Florida-registered company owned by Melania Trump, the wife of U.S. President Donald Trump. Hyperliquid cheered the whole episode on X, saying the transparency of trading positions on its platform has redefined trading. ""When a whale shorts $450M+ BTC and wants a public audience, it's only possible on Hyperliquid. When headlines say ""Bitcoin Market on Edge,"" they are equating ""Hyperliquid"" with the ""market."" Anyone can photoshop a PNL screenshot. No one can question a Hyperliquid position, just like no one can question a Bitcoin balance. The decentralized future is here,"" Hyperliquid said . The platform was in the news last week after an influential whale executed the so-called ""liquidation arbitrage"" by extracting floating profits, leading to a margin shortage.

Social engineering attacks have also escalated, with hackers breaching Kaito AI’s social media to manipulate token prices and crypto founders being targeted through fake Zoom calls containing malware. Additionally, high-profile security breaches and physical attacks are also becoming more of a problem, especially after the recent armed home invasion of streamer Kaitlyn Siragusa. Fake Crypto Exchange Emails Trick Users The crypto industry is facing a surge in phishing scams targeting users of major exchanges like Coinbase and Gemini. Cybercriminals have been sending fraudulent emails that seem to come from these platforms, instructing users to transition to self-custodial wallets. The emails provide detailed instructions on downloading the legitimate Coinbase Wallet or Gemini's wallet service but include pre-generated recovery phrases that are controlled by scammers. Once users set up wallets using these phrases and transfer their assets, the threat actors can instantly drain their funds. In an attempt to add credibility, the fraudulent emails reference ongoing legal battles. The Coinbase-related scam falsely claims that a court ruling forced the exchange to operate as a registered broker, mandating users to move their assets to self-custodial wallets. It even mentions a class-action lawsuit against Coinbase over unregistered securities sales, although the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently dismissed its case against the exchange on Feb. 27. Similarly, Gemini users have been targeted with emails that refer to a supposed court decision requiring them to migrate to a new wallet. The SEC previously sued Gemini over its Earn program, but the case was also dropped on Feb. 26. Coinbase acknowledged the scam , and warned its users never to trust pre-generated recovery phrases. The company reiterated that it will never send such phrases and urged users to stay vigilant. Gemini has yet to officially respond to the reports. Phishing is still one of the most serious security threats in the crypto industry. Blockchain security firm CertiK’s annual Web3 security report revealed that phishing scams cost users more than $1 billion in 2024 alone, with 296 reported incidents. The issue is not limited to email scams. In fact, cybercriminals have also been targeting crypto founders through sophisticated social engineering tactics. At least three founders recently reported that they narrowly avoided a hacking attempt involving fake Zoom meetings . The attackers posed as potential business partners and, during the call, claimed to have audio issues before sending a link to a new meeting, which contained malware that is designed to steal sensitive information. With the rise of these increasingly deceptive attacks, crypto users and industry leaders are urged to be extra cautious. Kaito AI Hit by Social Media Hack Meanwhile, Kaito AI and its founder Yu Hu recently fell victim to a social media hack on March 15, with hackers taking control of the project's X account to spread false information. The attackers claimed that Kaito wallets were compromised and warned users that their funds were not safe. These posts were part of a broader scheme to manipulate the price of KAITO tokens, as on-chain investigator DeFi Warhol revealed that the hackers opened a short position on KAITO before making the fraudulent announcements. By inducing panic selling, the perpetrators planned to crash the token’s price and profit from the market drop. The Kaito AI team quickly regained control of their social media account and reassured its users that there was no breach of Kaito wallets. The team stated that despite having strong security measures in place, the attack bore similarities to recent incidents involving hacked Twitter accounts. This case adds to the increasing number of social engineering attacks and security breaches that are currently affecting the crypto industry. Several high-profile exploits popped up over the past few months. On Feb. 26, the X account of Pump.fun, a fair launch platform, was hacked by an attacker promoting fraudulent tokens, including a fake governance token named ”Pump.” Blockchain investigator ZackXBT later connected this incident to hacks targeting the Jupiter DAO account and the DogWifCoin X account. In another case, the Alberta Securities Commission issued a warning on March 7 about a crypto scam known as CanCap. The scheme relied on fake news articles and counterfeit endorsements using the images of Canadian politicians to lure victims. By playing on the fears of a trade war between Canada and the United States, scammers claimed that the project had the backing of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to entice investors. Attackers are employing increasingly sophisticated tactics to manipulate markets and defraud investors, making it crucial for users to verify information before making any financial decisions. Four Charged in Home Invasion Targeting Bitcoin Another major security issue plaguing crypto users is burglaries. Four suspects were charged in connection with the violent home invasion of online streamer Kaitlyn Siragusa, who is known as Amouranth. The attack took place on March 2, when several armed people entered her home, held her at gunpoint, and demanded access to her cryptocurrency holdings. Authorities identified two of the suspects as Dylan Nesho Campbell and Bryan Anthony Salazar Guerrero, while the remaining two are minors aged 16 and 17. Each suspect faces charges of aggravated kidnapping and aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon. Siragusa reported that the intruders beat her and tried to coerce her into handing over her private keys. Her husband, who was on speakerphone during the ordeal, realized the severity of the situation and grabbed a handgun while monitoring the invaders' movements through the home's security cameras. The armed men took the phone, believing they could use it to access a crypto app, while Siragusa managed to stall them by leading them around the house in search of a cold storage device. While the intruders were distracted, Siragusa ran upstairs to her husband, who fired three shots at the suspects. One of the rounds may have struck one of the attackers before they fled the scene. Law enforcement arrived shortly after to secure the area and investigate the attempted robbery. The attack was very likely financially motivated, as Siragusa previously shared to her followers that she held around 211 Bitcoin, which was worth more than $20 million in late 2024. 7 gang members arrested in the UK for kidnapping The incident adds to a growing wave of targeted kidnappings and home invasions against cryptocurrency holders. In January of 2025, a UK court sentenced seven gang members involved in the prolonged kidnapping and assault of a crypto investor, who was coerced into transferring funds. That same month, Ledger co-founder David Balland was kidnapped in France and held for ransom before being rescued by authorities.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|BUSINESS|REGULATION|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-17 04:58:26

As the blockchain continues to evolve, its network activity has seen fluctuations, with shifting trends in meme coin trading and growing institutional interest in regulated derivatives. The introduction of Solana futures follows the path set by Bitcoin and Ethereum, potentially paving the way for a SOL ETF as asset managers increasingly seek exposure to the cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, major industry players like FalconX and StoneX are facilitating institutional access to Solana through the first-ever CME Solana futures block trade. Solana Celebrates Five Years: A Look at Its Journey and Future Prospects Solana (SOL), the blockchain known for its speed and scalability, marked its five-year anniversary on Sunday, a major milestone for the network that has grown to become the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Despite recent fluctuations in network activity, Solana continues to position itself as a leading player in the crypto space, with significant developments on the horizon. ”Happy Solana 0 block day to all those who celebrate,” wrote Anatoly Yakovenko, Solana’s co-founder, in a post on X. Several key projects that originated on the Solana blockchain also joined in the celebrations, including Phantom Wallet and the viral meme coin launchpad Pump.fun. Since its launch, Solana has been recognized for its high-speed transactions and low fees, making it a favored blockchain for DeFi projects, NFTs, and meme coins. However, the past five years have not been without challenges, from network outages to regulatory uncertainty and the collapse of FTX, one of its biggest backers. The FTX collapse in November 2022 sent SOL’s price plummeting below $10, shaking investor confidence. However, Solana's resilience was evident, as the network recovered to its 2022 peak price levels before settling at around $127 today. Solana co-founder Raj Gokal previously described this period as a ”crucible moment” for the blockchain, one that tested its durability and commitment to decentralization. Despite celebrating its anniversary, Solana has seen a decline in active users in recent months. The number of active addresses on the network has been dropping since November 2023, and March is expected to record even fewer active users than February. This decline is closely tied to the waning popularity of Pump.fun, a meme coin launchpad that became one of the fastest-growing crypto startups in history. Launched in May 2024, Pump.fun achieved an astonishing $100 million in cumulative revenue in just 217 days. However, recent meme coin scandals, including a political controversy involving the President of Argentina, have caused investor sentiment to shift. As a result, the percentage of tokens ”graduating” from Pump.fun to Solana’s decentralized exchange Raydium dropped to just 0.66% on Saturday, the lowest level since the platform’s early days. This metric serves as a barometer for meme coin trading enthusiasm, and its decline suggests that speculative interest in the sector has cooled off. The Firedancer Upgrade: A Game-Changer for Solana While network activity may be slowing down, Solana's development team is pushing forward with major upgrades aimed at solidifying the blockchain’s long-term scalability. One of the most anticipated updates is the launch of Jump Crypto’s Firedancer, an alternative high-performance validator client that is expected to significantly boost Solana’s speed and resilience. A prototype version of the software, Frankendancer, was launched in September 2023, providing a preview of the benefits that Firedancer could bring. The full rollout of Firedancer is expected in 2025, with key figures in the Solana community—such as Helius co-founder Mert Mumtaz—predicting a launch by the end of Q2. Firedancer will help Solana move closer to its ambitious goal of processing 1 million transactions per second (TPS), further cementing its reputation as one of the fastest blockchains in the industry. By diversifying its validator clients, Solana also aims to reduce its risk of network outages, a problem that has plagued the blockchain in the past. Another major development that could drive demand for Solana is the potential approval of Solana-based ETFs . Several asset management firms have filed applications for ETFs that include SOL, and analysts have identified Solana as one of the most likely cryptocurrencies to receive approval, alongside Litecoin (LTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), and XRP. An ETF approval would be a major milestone for Solana, making it more accessible to institutional investors and potentially leading to a surge in demand. With Ethereum ETFs already gaining traction, Solana’s inclusion in a fund could position it as the next major institutional-friendly crypto asset. Despite recent setbacks in network activity, Solana’s long-term trajectory remains strong. The blockchain has demonstrated resilience in the face of adversity, bouncing back from the FTX collapse and continuing to develop its infrastructure with the Firedancer upgrade. If network adoption stabilizes, and ETF approvals come through, Solana could be positioned for another major price breakout in 2025. However, the meme coin sector’s decline and ongoing regulatory concerns could continue to weigh on short-term sentiment. FalconX Executes First Block Trade for CME Group’s Solana Futures Ahead of Market Launch In related news, digital asset prime broker FalconX has successfully executed the first-ever block trade for CME Group's Solana futures, marking a significant milestone in the regulated trading of SOL derivatives. The trade, conducted with StoneX as a counterparty, came just a day before the official launch of CME Group’s Solana futures contracts, set for March 17. The move is part of FalconX’s broader strategy to enhance institutional participation in Solana’s growing futures market, according to Josh Barkhordar, head of US sales at the firm. CME Group, one of the world's leading derivatives exchanges, introduced Solana futures contracts in late February in response to rising institutional demand. The contracts are structured similarly to Bitcoin and Ethereum futures, which historically served as precursors to ETF approvals by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The new Solana futures contracts come in two sizes: Standard contracts: Representing 500 SOL each Micro contracts: Representing 25 SOL each Both are cash-settled, using the CME CF Solana-Dollar Reference Rate, calculated daily at 4:00 p.m. London time to provide a standardized benchmark for SOL’s US dollar price. With major institutions seeking regulated exposure to Solana, industry experts see this launch as a significant step toward a potential SOL ETF. Following the CME Group's launch of Solana futures, several asset management firms have submitted applications to the SEC for spot Solana ETFs. Among the notable applicants: Franklin Templeton (managing over $1.5 trillion in assets) filed for a SOL ETF in late February 2025. Grayscale, 21Shares, Bitwise, VanEck, and Canary Capital have also entered the race, hoping to bring Solana-based investment products to institutional investors. The move follows the regulatory pattern set by Bitcoin and Ethereum, where futures trading preceded the eventual SEC approval of spot ETFs. Analysts suggest Solana's ETF approval could be a reality in 2025, given the growing institutional interest and the SEC's evolving stance on crypto-based investment products. As a key liquidity provider for CME Group’s crypto derivatives, FalconX has been aggressively expanding its presence in institutional markets. The firm has reported executing over $1.5 trillion in trading volume, covering 400+ tokens for around 600 institutional clients. Recent strategic acquisitions further bolster its footprint: In January 2025, FalconX acquired Arbelos Markets, a derivatives platform specializing in institutional-grade crypto options and futures trading. In February 2024, FalconX partnered with TP ICAP’s Fusion Digital Assets, strengthening its liquidity and data solutions offerings. These moves reinforce FalconX’s role as a leading prime broker for institutions looking to trade regulated digital asset products. The launch of Solana futures comes amid a strong surge in demand for CME’s crypto derivatives offerings. The exchange has reported: 202,000 average daily contracts traded in early 2025, marking a 73% increase year-over-year. 243,600 average open interest contracts, up 55% year-over-year. Over 11,300 unique accounts actively trading crypto derivatives on the platform. Solana Derivatives Trading Booms Amid Market Pullback On centralized crypto exchanges, Solana futures have also experienced a significant increase in trading activity. Data from Coinglass shows: Solana derivatives volume surged 66% to $7.24 billion, reflecting bullish sentiment. Long/short ratios remain above 2, indicating a bias toward long positions despite recent liquidations. $12.29 million in 24-hour liquidations suggest high volatility, as traders navigate Solana’s price fluctuations.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,SOL|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-17 05:00:00

In a recent tweet, Farina stated , “Whales are desperately trying to exit Ethereum. They need liquidity to survive. Expect this capital to flow towards $XRP.” This assertion suggests that large-scale Ethereum holders (“whales”) seek liquidity, potentially redirecting their investments to XRP. Whales are desperately trying to exit Ethereum. They need liquidity to survive. Expect this capital to flow towards $XRP — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) March 15, 2025 Community Reactions The crypto community had mixed reactions to Farina’s statement. Juicy.stack expressed skepticism about abandoning Ethereum in favor of XRP, questioning why anyone would leave Ethereum “to buy the single thing that has actually performed worse over the last 7-8 years.” This sentiment reflects concerns over XRP’s historical price performance compared to Ethereum. Marat took a more critical view of Ethereum’s future, claiming that it was in its final stages, “We are witnessing $ETH taking its last few breaths.” He argued that there was “absolutely no way” Ethereum could reach $4,000 or set a new all-time high, indicating a belief that the asset’s best days are behind it. Sasha countered this perspective by highlighting Ethereum’s strong ecosystem, noting that XRP “doesn’t have a shadow of the ecosystem of dapps” found on Ethereum. He specifically mentioned projects like Ondo and Quant, questioning why they were not built on the XRPL. His remarks emphasize Ethereum’s established role in decentralized applications, a key factor many investors consider when evaluating its long-term viability. These differing opinions underscore the ongoing debate about Ethereum’s position in the market and whether XRP presents a viable alternative. Current Market Overview As of press time, Ethereum is trading at approximately $1,937, experiencing a 0.3% decline over the past 24 hours. This price point is notably below its all-time high of $4,862.10, recorded on November 10, 2021. In contrast, XRP trades at $2.42, reflecting a 2.54% increase over the last 24 hours. The cryptocurrency has shown resilience and growth potential, attracting attention from investors seeking alternatives to Ethereum. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ethereum’s Ecosystem and Future Prospects Despite current market challenges, Ethereum maintains a robust ecosystem, particularly in decentralized finance (DeFi). The platform hosts a multitude of dApps, including notable projects like Ondo and Quant, which contribute to its extensive utility and adoption. This established infrastructure is a critical consideration for investors evaluating long-term prospects. However, some analysts caution about potential risks within the DeFi sector if Ethereum’s price declines significantly. A drop to $1,000 could trigger substantial liquidations and dampen investor interest in DeFi platforms reliant on Ethereum. XRP’s Position and Potential XRP has gained attention due to its unique consensus mechanism and focus on facilitating efficient cross-border payments . Farina has expressed optimism about XRP’s future, suggesting that a price of $20 could be just the beginning for even higher price levels. This perspective aligns with the views of some investors who see XRP as a viable alternative amidst Ethereum’s current market challenges. The cryptocurrency market is characterized by rapid changes and diverse opinions. Edo Farina’s recent comments have sparked discussions about the potential shift of capital from Ethereum to XRP. While Ethereum continues to offer a comprehensive ecosystem with numerous dApps, current market conditions have led some investors to explore alternatives like XRP.

This move allows us to implement additional upgrades to prevent further misuse.” The OKX helpdesk confirmed that the DEX aggregator was temporarily suspended for an “internal review and upgrade” but did not provide a timeline. It added that crypto wallet services will remain available to all customers, but it will “pause new wallet creation in select markets during this time.” Source: OKX On March 11, Bloomberg reported that European Union financial watchdogs were investigating the firm’s DEX aggregator, called OKX Web3, and its wallet services for their alleged role in laundering funds from the Bybit hack. “Over the past few days, we’ve faced targeted media attacks questioning our integrity and operations,” the firm stated in a blog post. It added that it “can’t ignore the fact that these attacks are happening at a time when we are actively fighting against financial crime.” According to Bybit CEO Ben Zhou , nearly $100 million from the $1.5 billion Bybit hack had been laundered through OKX’s Web3 proxy, with a portion of the funds now untraceable. OKX responded on March 11, stating that the “Bloomberg article is misleading,” saying that when Bybit was hacked, OKX reacted in two ways: by freezing associated funds from moving into its CEX, and developing the new hack detection features. Related: Lazarus Group sends 400 ETH to Tornado Cash, deploys new malware OKX stated that the goal is to ensure that explorers properly highlight the actual DEX processing trades “rather than mistakenly identifying our aggregator as the point of trade.” The exchange has already deployed a “hacker address detection system” for its DEX aggregator in addition to a system to track the hacker’s latest addresses and block them on its centralized exchange in real time. “We already rolled out a lot of controls for OKX Web3 to fight with the misuse, including prohibited markets’ IP blocking and real-time black address detection and blocking system,” said OKX CEO Star Xu on March 17. The firm also clarified that the OKX Web3 DEX aggregator is not a custodian of customer assets, adding that its function is to provide access to liquidity across multiple protocols. However, “some have deliberately misrepresented our platform,” it said.

While the trend remains highly bearish on the daily chart, it has retraced briefly up following a double-digit gain in the last 72 hours. ATOM has continued to show signs of weakness on the daily timeframe following a consistent roller coaster in the last three months. It appeared to have slowed down a bit following a recent bounce off the $0.39 level. This level marked its lowest price in a year, and from the look of things, more breakdowns are underway as the market structure remains bearish from a short-term perspective. While the next breakdown may trigger more losses, it should signal a bearish extension on the mid-term scale. As seen on the daily chart, the descending trendline has been serving as resistance since last December. If the price manages to break above it, we may a major price retracement before resuming bearish at full speed. Retracing above the peak level should confirm a complete trend reversal. Looking back from where it initiated fall from the peak level of $10.7, ATOM has seen more than 70% loss. This put the crypto among the top loser mid-cap altcoins in the last three months. While there are no signs of a reversal yet, its mid-term bearish momentum may last to $1 before halting. ATOM’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview The key resistance level for a retest right now lies at $4.45. If the price breaks above the descending trendline, the immediate resistance level for an increase is $5.51. Right above it lies the $6.1 resistance. Resuming selling, the weekly $3.39 low is the key support to watch for a breakdown. A new low may come at $3 and probably $2.5 in the future.

This could lead to a major trend shift, but the crypto will likely face resistance anytime soon. Unlike most mid-cap altcoins, Kava recorded less loss during the wide market correction and remained well above the $0.38 level throughout the storm. Though this price marked the crypto’s lowest level in the last four months after losing roughly half of its valuation. However, things might get worse for the crypto in the future as it forms a strong bearish pattern on a short-term scale. While it continues to hold the above price level as support, it has created a series of lower highs on the daily chart. It attempts to create a new one following the latest surge. No doubt, it will likely face rejection at the descending trendline, acting as dynamic resistance for the past four months. Once that happens, we can expect a drop capable of slipping the price back to the mentioned price level, serving as crucial parallel support since the correction began. Inversely, a successful cross above this descending trendline could bring a temporal shift in the trend. It must reclaim last December’s high before confirming a major shift. But as it stands, Kava remains under the bear’s radar despite the latest surge. A drop off the parallel support could cause a catastrophic loss in the future. KAVA’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview Following the latest surge, Kava is targeting the resistance line at $0.51. There is lots of resistance above in case of a break, but close ones to watch are $0.556 and $0.624. Above it lies $0.68. Right now, the $0.446 level is providing support, along with the recent lowest $0.38 level. Losing it could cause a serious collapse to $0.32.

This raised global concern about how safe crypto assets are for bringing them into the mainstream financial zone, as discussed by an influential figure in the EU council. Let’s dive in. ECB’s Villeroy Sounds the Alarm Francois Villeroy de Galhau, a senior member of the European Central Bank’s Governing Council, has voiced strong concerns about the US approach to crypto. In an interview with La Tribune Dimanche, he warned that financial crises often originate in the US and spread globally. By supporting digital assets and non-bank financial systems, the American administration is taking unnecessary risks that could destabilize the global economy. Villeroy assured that Europe’s financial system is well-regulated, minimizing any threat of a banking crisis. He also called for a stronger international role for the euro, urging Europe to build a powerful savings and investment union to attract global capital. Crypto as a Solution, Not a Threat Not everyone agrees with Villeroy. Crypto analyst Christopher Perkins strongly opposes his stance, arguing that digital assets reduce financial risks. He highlights the 1974 Herstatt Bank collapse as a cautionary tale of traditional finance failures. Unlike conventional assets, which take days to settle, crypto transactions occur in real time, improving liquidity and reducing systemic risks. Drawing from his experience during the Lehman Brothers collapse, Perkins stresses that liquidity is everything—and crypto enhances it. He urges Europe to embrace blockchain technology for faster settlements and improved financial security. Trump’s Memecoin Mania Beyond policy changes, Trump has also been linked to the memecoin craze. Reports suggest his family has endorsed unregulated tokens since he took office, using his political influence to pump and dump assets. Many believe he is leveraging the crypto industry to recover his election spending and build personal wealth at the expense of investors. This has drawn comparisons to past economic downturns caused by his financial strategies. Bitcoin Reserve Plan Raises Questions Meanwhile, Trump continues to push pro-crypto policies, including a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a separate digital asset stockpile. His administration has also rolled back several SEC lawsuits against crypto firms. However, analyst Bakcho_Panda highlights a major twist in the Bitcoin Reserve plan—the US is not buying BTC. Instead, it’s selling seized crypto, leading to speculation that the reserve grows only when more assets are confiscated. This raises concerns that the government may use crypto crackdowns to expand its holdings while presenting itself as a supporter of digital assets.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,FIAT|BTC|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-17 05:16:54

This includes an additional civil penalty of almost $221,500. The CFTC has proven that Debiex was faking itself as a crypto platform. On March 13th, Judge Douglas granted the CFTC’s motion for summary judgment. Douglas said Debliex did not respond to the CFTC’s claims, and there’s no evidence that it was just “excusable neglect.” CFTC filed a legal case against Debiex in January last year. It sued the platform for running a “pig butchering scam.” The scam involved scammers developing fake romantic relationships with customers on social media, after which the customers were lured into investing in the bogus platform. The platform scam-baited 5 victims. These victims made deposits of a total of $2.3 million on Debiex. Zhāng Chéng Yáng was a “money mule” for Debiex, according to CFTC. This is because his wallet was used to receive the stolen funds from the victims. On March 12, Judge Rayes approved a legal request (motion for default judgment) from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) against Zhāng. He accepted CFTC’s claims that Zhāng controlled the OKX crypto wallet “that received digital assets to which he had no legitimate claim.” The judge found that OKX was “voluntarily preserving” the funds in Zhāng’s wallet. The wallet contained $5.70 worth of USTD and up to 63 ETH, which amounted to $119,500 in total. The judge has ordered the transfer of these funds back to an unnamed victim’s account. Debiex reportedly hired female staff pretending to be successful traders CFTC claims that scammers directed the victims toward Debiex websites through social media. The platform marketed itself as a “Blockchain Network Decentralized perpetual contract trading platform.” Customers were lured under the pretense of “mining transactions” and futures trading. The details shared by CFTC state that Debiex staff consisted of women who would contact victims through “continuous and repeated messaging and sharing purported pictures of themselves.” These women portrayed themselves as “highly successful digital asset commodities traders.” According to the CFTC, once a victim created an account on Debiex’s platform and sent their cryptocurrency as a so-called investment, the platform would lie to them about the performance of their funds. This “fictitious information” was based on customer balances, profits, and trading positions. CFTC said, “All of this information was most likely false” and proved that customers’ digital assets were instead transferred to “numerous digital asset wallets in an attempt to obfuscate their destination.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

This move signals a change from its previous skepticism, where digital assets were seen as a financial risk due to their potential use in illicit activities. Now, with over 20 million active crypto users and a booming digital economy, Pakistan is embracing blockchain technology to regulate and integrate it into its financial system. Pakistan establishes Crypto Council to regulate digital assets The finance chief highlighted Pakistan’s commitment to building a regulated and responsible crypto ecosystem, integrating blockchain innovations to boost economic growth. pic.twitter.com/PqfH5bmVxe — PEconomist (@peconomist_) March 16, 2025 A Strategic Shift Toward Blockchain Pakistan’s decision to create the PCC is a big change from its earlier view that crypto was a security risk. With this new council, the country now wants to be a strong player in the global digital finance space. This comes at a key moment, as more countries are realizing the benefits of blockchain technology, and even the U.S. has set up a special Bitcoin reserve. Who’s Leading the Charge? Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb will chair the PCC, bringing together top regulatory figures, including the Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan and the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP). This high-level leadership structure ensures that blockchain integration is approached with financial stability, security, and compliance in mind. The development comes a week after the government appointed Bilal bin Saqib as the Chief Advisor to the Finance Minister for the PCC. As the council’s CEO, he has emphasized that the PCC will not just regulate but also support the growth of blockchain and digital finance in Pakistan. Why is it Necessary? The Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) has been set up to create clear rules for using cryptocurrency in the country. Its main job is to make sure crypto adoption is safe, organized, and beneficial for the economy. To do this, the council will work with international blockchain groups, learn from their experiences, and build a strong legal system that protects users from fraud or misuse. One of the biggest reasons Pakistan is embracing crypto is its huge remittance market. Every year, Pakistanis living abroad send home around $35 billion. Right now, sending money internationally can be slow and expensive, with banks and other services charging high fees. Crypto can change this by making transactions faster, cheaper, and more efficient, allowing families to receive more money with fewer deductions. This move shows that Pakistan isn’t just trying to control crypto—it wants to become an important player in the global digital economy. If the PCC successfully puts its plans into action, Pakistan could see major advancements in blockchain technology, digital finance, and economic growth. The next few months will be crucial in determining how well this council can turn its vision into reality.",News|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|TECHNOLOGY|FIAT|BTC|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-17 05:24:39

But while ETH suffers, a fresh player—prop trading firm token FXGuys ($FXG) is drawing attention. Some people are already calling it the best crypto to buy right now since analysts estimate great upside potential. We will explore in this post why $FXG could be a wise investment given growing worries about ETH’s possible downturn! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Analyst Forecasts a Drop to $1,200 as Ethereum Approaches a 16-Month Low Once Ethereum was designated as part of the U.S. Crypto Reserve, it took a wild ride! Initially sending ETH skyward to $2,500, the excitement from the major announcement on March 2, 2025, did not last long. The flagship altcoin sank 15% a day later, falling to a 16-month low of $2,035. Meanwhile, market expert Nebraskagonner, raised a warning for ETH investors by noting an alarming trend on the charts. The analyst noticed a typical double-top formation on Ethereum’s monthly chart—an unsettling indication that usually means more difficulty ahead. Nebraskagonner did not mince words when he stated that ETH may experience a serious collapse. According to the researcher, the altcoin might fall to levels not seen since the severe 2022 bear market. His breakdown? A potential decline of up to $1,200. Despite the grim outlook, there is a silver lining: $FXG, an alternate investment that may provide ETH holders with an exit strategy. Meanwhile, Ethereum has fallen 3.21% this week and is currently trading at $2,290 . The FXGuys Prop Trading Company Gives Hope to Investors As Ethereum crashes, the public presale of FXGuys presents yet another chance to make money.

Over the years, it has become one of the most active blockchain networks by transaction volume and is among the few cryptocurrencies proposed for inclusion in a US digital asset reserve. Since the first Solana block was built on March 16, 2020, the network has processed more than 408 billion transactions and nearly $1 trillion worth of value on decentralized exchanges — establishing itself as one of the industry’s leading layer-1 blockchains. Source: Solana Here are some of the Solana ecosystem’s most notable milestones since it was launched by Solana Labs CEO Anatoly Yakovenko and Solana co-founder Raj Gokal to the public in 2020. Solana was born just as the COVID-19 pandemic hit While Solana’s origins can be traced back to late 2017 when Yakovenko released a white paper outlining a timekeeping method for blockchains called “Proof of History,” but Solana wasn’t launched until March 2020 — right as the world started to enact emergency measures against the COVID-19 pandemic. The high-speed, low-cost layer 1 Solana blockchain launch was assisted by crypto-focused venture capital firm Multicoin Capital, leading a financing round for Solana, which brought in roughly $20 million worth of private token sales in July 2019. Source: OKX Additional funding poured in soon after, and within 20 months of launching, Solana was hailed as a potential “Ethereum killer” as it soared to a $77.8 billion market cap at the peak of the 2020-2021 bull cycle. Solana hit hard by 2022 bear market, FTX collapse — but bounced back The 2022 bear market, coupled with the catastrophic collapse of crypto exchange FTX , tanked Solana’s market cap to $3 billion — a whopping 96% fall from its previous peak — by late 2022. Sam Bankman-Fried’s former firm purchased around 58 million Solana tokens — currently worth $7.4 billion — from Solana Labs and the Solana Foundation. Solana was “by far the most serious” layer 1 that FTX was helping scale, Fortune said in an April 2022 report. FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Nov. 11, 2022, and is still in the process of unlocking hundreds of millions of dollars worth of staked Solana tokens from FTX’s wallets. Solana’s price fell to $8.30 on Dec. 29, 2022. Despite the setback, 2023 marked the start of Solana's impressive comeback, which saw its market cap rise nearly 50-fold from $3 billion to over $140 billion by Jan. 19, 2025. Memecoin craze takes Solana adoption to the next level One of the biggest reasons behind Solana’s comeback was the crypto memecoin craze that took place between late 2023 and 2024 — a $100 billion market that Solana dominated. Several Solana memecoins such as Bonk ( BONK ), Dogwifhat ( WIF ), Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) and Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) rose to multibillion-dollar market caps in early 2024 — around the time Solana memecoin launchpad Pump.fun became one of the most popular crypto platforms for memecoin lovers. Pump.fun alone has raked in over $540 million in revenue over the last 12 months and even surpassed Ethereum over 24-hour intervals at some points. Solana is home to many of the largest memecoins by market cap. Source: CoinGecko No Solana memecoin, however, drew more attention than the Official Trump (TRUMP) token launched by now-US President Donald Trump’s inner circle on Jan. 17 — which soared to a $14.6 billion market within two days before it came crashing down. The TRUMP memecoin briefly pushed Solana decentralized finance (DeFi) total value locked to $14.2 billion, trailing only Ethereum, DefiLlama data shows. happy 5th birthday @solana 🥳 congratulations on 5 years of building & shipping the greatest tech to ever grace our industry 🫶 manlets on top 🎉 pic.twitter.com/Clkv3eEpn9 — pump.fun (@pumpdotfun) March 16, 2025 The Solana blockchain has also become the third largest adopter of stablecoins behind Ethereum and Tron. Solana unveils the first major crypto phone In May 2023, Solana released the first major crypto phone, called “Solana Saga.” Sales for the Android device with the built-in crypto wallet started slow but skyrocketed after a 30 million BONK airdrop enticed memecoin enthusiasts to make a purchase. Solana also unveiled a newer, shinier Solana “Seeker” smartphone last September to better facilitate memecoin trading and accrue token rewards. While most reviewers say the Solana phones lack the technical capabilities of an iPhone or Google Pixel, Solana has seen over 140,000 presales for the two products. The Solana Seeker phone is currently priced at $500. Hardware specifications of the Solana Seeker phone. Source: Solana Mobile Solana, however, has also been plagued with several network outages over its five-year span — halting block production for 20 hours in some instances. Solana validators have been forced to restart the network on several occasions when network activity surged. A new independent validator client called Firedancer is scheduled to go live on Solana’s mainnet sometime in 2025 to address Solana’s client diversity woes. It has been touted as a superior solution to “QUIC” — a Google-developed data transfer protocol that has failed to process transactions on Solana over a dozen times. Solana set to be included in Trump’s Digital Asset Stockpile The Trump administration says it will include Solana in the Digital Asset Stockpile, which it confirmed through an executive order on March 7. It is the youngest cryptocurrency on the list. The Digital Asset Stockpile will initially use cryptocurrency forfeited in government criminal cases. Related: Solana proposal to cut inflation rate by up to 80% fails to pass The US doesn’t appear to hold Solana, according to crypto analytics firm Arkham Intelligence. However, the White House said it would complete an audit of crypto asset holdings. Trump initially announced that Solana would become a US reserve asset on March 2. Source: Donald Trump However, he later established a Bitcoin-only reserve and the Digital Asset Stockpile, which looks like it will include Solana in addition to Ether ( ETH ), XRP ( XRP ) and Cardano ( ADA ). Solana is currently priced at $128.17 — the sixth-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $64.5 billion. Solana is down 56% from its all-time high as the broader market continues to navigate through recession fears and weakened market sentiment of late.

Amidst all this volatility, one Shiba Inu trader has raised the alarm, predicting a staggering 7900% surge for a rival token priced at under 20 cents—potentially reaching $16 within a time frame that is turning skeptics into wholehearted believers. Let us find out why analysts and investors agree. Shiba Inu Price Undergoes A Meme Coin Reality Check Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains a crypto legend, but the glitz is thinning out in 2025. The token on March 13 stands at $0.0000128 , tumbling hard from its January high of $0.000042—an over 40% plunge that has been fueled by a 6% fall in just the last 2 weeks alone. In ecosystem developments, Shibarium’s 24-hour transactions surged to nearly 2,000%, which signifies new interest in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and maybe a turn around in prices. The movement signifies growing traction in the network after a session of low activity levels. The Shiba Inu price narrative is marred by stuck ecosystem projects. Integration with NFT and updates to ShibaSwap haven’t done much to shake the boat, and the token’s destiny continues to ride in lockstep with Bitcoin. Analysts at Coincodex have a mixture of bullish and bearish Shiba Inu price predictions at a projected high of $0.000025 by late March, but a significant decline to $0.000011 in the next 3 months unless some gigantic event happens. Remittix (RTX): The PayFi Visionary Redefining Crypto Wealth Remittix (RTX) is entering the scene as a PayFi trailblazer ready to redefine cross-border finance. Unlike hype-based meme coins, Remittix utilizes blockchain to facilitate instant , affordable transactions with added security, combining decentralized finance and real-world FIAT transaction settlements. This combination facilitates a smooth on-ramp and off-ramp between digital and fiat markets, offering a platform that is greater than a currency but a financial revolution in the making. Remittix’s presale outcomes have been nothing short of incredible. At $0.0734 per token, it has raised close to $13.9 million in its phases, with momentum picking up. Daily token sales are gaining pace, a testament to investor enthusiasm for a project promising to run transactions at a fraction of conventional expense. Many Shiba Inu price analysts are buzzing, predicting a $16 valuation in Q4 2025—a 7900% gain that could turn a modest investment into a fortune in a few months. Remittix is better compared to Shiba Inu. SHIB’s over 40% decline YoY highlights its hype dependence, whereas RTX’s rise hinges on a PayFi model delivering real utility. Shiba Inu’s once booming community is fizzling, whereas that of Remittix is rallying around a cause of revolution. Being Late To Remittix New ICO Is Dangerous Play; Analysts Warn The crypto trend is evolving, and Remittix is surfing the wave. With presale inching towards conclusion and currently at $0.0734 per token, the chance to be part of a 7900% potential project by the end of 2025 is fast approaching. It’s not a gamble on viral phenomena—it’s an intelligent investment in a PayFi pioneer set to revolutionize global finance.

On November 5, 2024 , Josh Mandell , a former Wall Street trader , publicly called his shot when Bitcoin was trading at $74K . His prophecy, cryptic yet poetic, hinted at a massive Bitcoin rally —potentially reaching $444,000 per BTC . Could this prophecy come true? What do the mysterious dates mean? How accurate has Mandell been so far? Let’s break down the prophecy and what it could mean for Bitcoin’s price action this cycle. Who is Josh Mandell? Josh Mandell isn’t just another crypto influencer—he’s a seasoned trader with a deep background in traditional finance . His Credentials: Salomon Brothers (1990-1998): The legendary trading firm from Liar’s Poker . Caxton Associates: One of the most prestigious hedge funds. Bitcoin & MSTR Trader: Actively trading and sharing insights publicly. Unlike many anonymous Bitcoin forecasters, Mandell’s track record and experience give credibility to his market insights. Why Should You Trust His Bitcoin Judgment? As Bitcoiners say: “Don’t trust, verify.” Josh Mandell has been publicly trading Bitcoin and MicroStrategy (MSTR) for over a year. His trades and analysis are available for scrutiny, and he initially seeded his portfolio with $2.1 million . While no one can predict Bitcoin’s price with certainty, his background in macro trading and market cycles makes his call worth considering. The Prophecy: A Breakdown On November 5, 2024 , Josh Mandell made The Prophecy , predicting a major Bitcoin price movement. Let’s analyze the key elements of his message: “When $84K becomes the base…” Suggests that Bitcoin would stabilize above $84,000 before making its next major move. So far, Bitcoin has traded above $84K for some time , validating this part of the call. “360 more … A trio of fours, times a grand.” This cryptic phrase seems to imply a move from $84K to $444K ( three fours, times $1,000 ). In other words, he sees $444K as Bitcoin’s potential peak this cycle . Decoding the Important Dates Josh’s prophecy mentioned three key dates : November 7, 2024: Bitcoin was trading at $74K and was on the verge of breaking out. January 16, 2025: A critical point in the cycle. (Did Bitcoin confirm a new uptrend?) March 14, 2025: A major event or price action shift is expected. So far, Bitcoin has followed a strong uptrend since his initial call, adding credibility to his forecast. Could Bitcoin Really Reach $444K? A $444,000 Bitcoin price sounds ambitious, but it’s not entirely impossible. Here’s how it could happen: Bitcoin’s 4-Year Cycle Pattern – Historically, Bitcoin sees parabolic moves after each halving. A peak near $400K+ would align with past cycle expansions. Institutional Demand – ETFs and large funds are accumulating BTC at record rates . Supply shock + demand surge could drive prices exponentially higher . Global Liquidity Trends – Central banks are pivoting back to easy monetary policy , fueling risk-on assets like Bitcoin. If Bitcoin follows its historical post-halving trend , a peak near $400K-$500K isn’t out of the question . What If The Prophecy Fails? Even the best traders aren’t right 100% of the time . If Bitcoin doesn’t reach $444K, it doesn’t mean the prophecy was worthless. It could simply mean: Bitcoin peaks at a lower target (e.g., $250K or $300K). The cycle extends longer than expected (into late 2025 or 2026). Macroeconomic factors (recession, regulations) slow Bitcoin’s growth. Regardless of the exact target, Josh Mandell’s insight suggests Bitcoin’s uptrend is far from over . Final Thoughts: Is This the Cycle of $444K? Josh Mandell’s Bitcoin prophecy is one of the boldest price calls this cycle . His $84K base call has already played out. Key cycle dates have aligned with major moves. The possibility of $444K BTC remains open. What do YOU think? Will Bitcoin reach $444K this cycle? Or is this prophecy too ambitious? Conclusion: The Bitcoin Prophecy Unfolds Josh Mandell’s Bitcoin prophecy is still in motion . $84K base? Confirmed. Next major target? $444K. Will it happen? Time will tell. Regardless of the exact price, Mandell’s call reinforces the massive upside potential of Bitcoin this cycle . Will Bitcoin make history again? Stay tuned.",Crypto News|Press Release|bitcoin price prediction|Bitcoin prophecy|Josh Mandell Bitcoin forecast,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoin World', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinworld,2025-03-17 05:35:27
41792140,https://coinpedia.org/?p=432340,1742189791,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,North Korea’s $1.14 Billion Bitcoin Stash Puts It Among the Top 3 Government Holders,https://coinpedia.org/news/lazarus-groups-1-4b-crypto-heist-fuels-north-koreas-bitcoin-reserves/,"The post North Korea’s $1.14 Billion Bitcoin Stash Puts It Among the Top 3 Government Holders appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News North Korea has quietly climbed the ranks to become one of the largest government holders of Bitcoin, surpassing even crypto-friendly nations like El Salvador and Bhutan. This is a major concern for crypto investors as Bitcoin in weak hands can raise the concern of liquidity, followed by a massive market crash if they try to sell these crypto assets to manage their countries’ financial position. The surge comes after the Lazarus Group—a state-backed hacking syndicate—pulled off a massive cyber heist, stealing over $1.4 billion in crypto from Bybit on February 21, 2025. A large portion of the loot, initially in Ethereum, was later converted into Bitcoin, swelling North Korea’s holdings to 13,562 BTC, valued at over $1.14 billion. The U.S. and North Korea: A Tale of Two BTC Strategies While North Korea has been quietly stacking Bitcoin through illicit means, the U.S. is taking a more structured approach. President Trump’s Executive Order on March 6, 2025, officially launched the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR), positioning the U.S. as the largest government Bitcoin holder with 198,109 BTC worth a staggering $16.71 billion. As per Arkham data , the U.K., sitting in second place with 61,245 BTC ($5.17 billion), has accumulated its stash through criminal seizures rather than direct accumulation. Meanwhile, Bhutan’s Druk Holdings manages 10,635 BTC ($897.6 million), and El Salvador, one of the first nations to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, holds 6,117 BTC ($516.11 million). Is Kim Jong Un Playing the Digital Gold Game? The timing of North Korea’s Bitcoin accumulation—coinciding with the U.S. unveiling its SBR—raises eyebrows. There is a growing possibility that Kim Jong Un is making a strategic play in the digital asset space, using stolen Bitcoin as a shadow reserve. Unlike traditional reserves of gold or fiat currency, Bitcoin offers a decentralized and censorship-resistant alternative, allowing nations to store wealth outside of global financial oversight. For North Korea, this is particularly advantageous, as sanctions have long restricted its access to international banking systems. By accumulating Bitcoin, Pyongyang secures an asset that can be used for global transactions without relying on the dollar-based financial network. While the U.S. frames its reserve as a financial strategy, North Korea’s BTC buildup appears to be a silent power move, blurring the lines between cybercrime and state policy. This marks a new phase in the geopolitical power struggle, where digital assets play a key role in economic and strategic dominance. Crypto Reaction is Negative The crypto space is fearing North Korea’s bitcoin gamble; many call their illegal Bitcoin holdings a political move to put pressure on the US government. The digital gold rush isn’t just about investment, it’s a geopolitical chess match. — Elize Millard (@ElizeMillard) March 16, 2025 Others are looking forward to the US taking action before other countries take control.

With the ability to leverage up to a healthy level of 2x, users can now tap into the demonstrable yield potential of bbSOL, potentially unlocking greater earning opportunities. As of Mar. 17, 2025, the net APR of Bybit Margin Staked SOL on Bybit stood at over 13%. Bybit’s Margin Staked SOL redefines earning opportunities on SOL. With the potential to grow SOL holdings by leveraged borrowing and staking, Bybit users stand to significantly enhance on-chain rewards through bbSOL. The platform is designed for a hassle-free experience, allowing for easy borrowing, staking, and earning all in one place. This streamlined approach eliminates the complexities often associated with managing multiple accounts or services. Additionally, users are afforded the flexibility to redeem bbSOL for SOL at any time in two ways—they may opt for Instant Redemption where users can receive their SOL immediately with no gas fee, or for Postponed Redemption for a better exchange rate compared to instant redemption without the gas fee waiver. Both redemption mechanisms ensure user control over their assets and allow them to adapt their strategies as needed. How Bybit’s Margin Staked SOL Works: Staking SOL: Users may stake SOL into Margin Staked SOL, enabling the system to automatically borrow funds based on the selected leverage.

With the ability to leverage up to a healthy level of 2x, users can now tap into the demonstrable yield potential of bbSOL, potentially unlocking greater earning opportunities. As of Mar. 17, 2025, the net APR of Bybit Margin Staked SOL on Bybit stood at over 13%. Bybit’s Margin Staked SOL redefines earning opportunities on SOL. With the potential to grow SOL holdings by leveraged borrowing and staking, Bybit users stand to significantly enhance on-chain rewards through bbSOL. The platform is designed for a hassle-free experience, allowing for easy borrowing, staking, and earning all in one place. This streamlined approach eliminates the complexities often associated with managing multiple accounts or services. Additionally, users are afforded the flexibility to redeem bbSOL for SOL at any time in two ways—they may opt for Instant Redemption where users can receive their SOL immediately with no gas fee, or for Postponed Redemption for a better exchange rate compared to instant redemption without the gas fee waiver. Both redemption mechanisms ensure user control over their assets and allow them to adapt their strategies as needed. How Bybit’s Margin Staked SOL Works: Staking SOL: Users may stake SOL into Margin Staked SOL, enabling the system to automatically borrow funds based on the selected leverage. Earning bbSOL: In return for staking, users will receive bbSOL, Bybit’s Liquid Staking Token, as proof of the staked SOL. Yield Accrual: Users may lock in to grow their bbSOL through optimal rewards allocation managed by Sanctum’s smart contract.

The exchange made the announcement on Mar.17, citing security issues and the need to fix incomplete tagging on blockchain explorers. According to their official statement, the suspension will allow OKX DEX aggregator to roll out new security measures to prevent further misuse. “Recently, we detected a coordinated effort by Lazarus Group to misuse our DeFi services. At the same time, we’ve noticed an increase in competitive attacks aiming to undermine our work,” OKX stated in its blog post. The exchange added that it consulted regulators before taking this step. We are temporarily pausing our DEX aggregator to address incomplete tagging on blockchain explorers while we also roll out new security features. This is to address the recent coordinated attacks by media along with unsuccessful efforts by Lazarus group to misuse our DeFi… pic.twitter.com/r6oHNIaalT — OKX (@okx) March 17, 2025 While the DEX aggregator is paused, wallet services remain available, though new wallet creation is temporarily restricted in select markets. OKX has already implemented a number of security improvements, such as real-time tracking to stop malicious addresses in its centralized exchange and a hacker address detection system for its web3 DEX aggregator. You might also like: OKX acquires MiFID II license in Europe In order to ensure that the actual DEXs processing trades are identified rather than their aggregator, the platform also stated that it is collaborating with blockchain explorers to rectify incomplete labeling. Despite the temporary suspension, OKX stressed that its web3 service is only a DEX aggregator and not a custodian of user assets. The exchange is further strengthening its security by implementing real-time tracking systems to identify and block hacker addresses. The Lazarus Group has been linked to multiple cyberattacks targeting cryptocurrency platforms, including the Feb. 21 $1.5 billion Bybit hack . In their latest wave of attacks targetting developers, the group has deployed six new malware packages on the Node Package Manager platform to steal credentials and wallet data. The hackers have also been using fake Zoom calls to trick crypto founders into downloading malicious software. Over $1.3 billion worth of cryptocurrency was stolen by North Korean hackers in 47 attacks in 2024, more than doubling the amount stolen the year before, according to Chainalysis.

He has to assure investors that the economy is strong while making it clear that the Federal Reserve is ready to cut interest rates if things start going south. The timing is brutal. Stocks have been unstable, bond yields are down, and the White House isn’t exactly helping. His message has to be precise—too much confidence and markets panic, too little and the sell-off deepens. The Fed is expected to keep interest rates steady when officials meet on March 18-19. But traders are betting on three rate cuts this year, starting in June. Economists are calling for two. If Powell signals only two, he’ll need to stress the Fed’s willingness to act fast if the job market shows signs of cracking. “At the margin, the Fed could make it slightly better or slightly worse,” said James Athey, portfolio manager at Marlborough Investment Management. “But clearly they can’t completely calm markets because the hit to sentiment has come largely from the White House.” Fed faces pressure as markets react to Trump’s economic policies Donald Trump has made things worse. The president’s trade war escalated fast, and the market is feeling it. Stocks have been in a free fall for the past month. Treasury yields are dropping. Consumer sentiment is down. The White House hasn’t stepped in to reassure anyone. Instead, Trump said on March 9 that the economy is in a “period of transition.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent doubled down, saying the markets are in need of a “detox.” None of that helped investors. Market volatility is already affecting Fed decisions. The two-year Treasury yield, which reacts the fastest to monetary policy shifts, has dropped nearly 60 basis points since January. It hit 3.83% this month, the lowest level in over five months. The S&P 500 is down 10% from its peak. The VIX, which measures market fear, hit its highest level since August. That’s the backdrop for Powell this week. He can’t ignore it. “Powell needs to give some sort of a signal that they’re watching it,” said Dominic Konstam, head of macro strategy at Mizuho Securities USA. The Fed doesn’t react to the stock market directly, but it can’t pretend this isn’t happening. Economic projections coming out this week are expected to show slower growth for 2025 and slightly higher core inflation, which removes food and energy costs. That makes the Fed’s job even harder. Inflation makes rate cuts complicated Inflation is still a problem. Consumer prices slowed in February. Producer prices didn’t move at all. But the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which the Fed watches closely, is still firm. Long-term inflation expectations have now climbed for three straight months, hitting a 30-year high. That’s why Powell can’t just promise rate cuts. “We’ll hear the message that things are still holding up and that policy is in a good place,” said Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo. She wants clarity on how the Fed is balancing inflation risks against a slowing economy. Matthew Luzzetti, chief US economist at Deutsche Bank, says the Fed will wait before moving rates. “There’s lots of uncertainty that’s out there,” he said . “They are going to be in a wait-and-see mode.” He doesn’t expect rate cuts this year but acknowledges that the inflation fight isn’t over. If the economy slows while inflation stays high, most economists expect the Fed to keep rates steady. But they’re also watching Trump’s other policies. Tax cuts and deregulation could push growth and inflation even higher, forcing the Fed to rethink its strategy. Powell and other officials are waiting to see the full impact before making a move. “Despite elevated levels of uncertainty, the US economy continues to be in a good place,” Powell said earlier this month in New York. “We do not need to be in a hurry and are well positioned to wait for greater clarity.” Fed’s balance sheet and Trump’s trade war add to uncertainty Investors are also looking for clues about the Fed’s balance sheet. Officials have been reducing it, a process called quantitative tightening (QT). Minutes from the Fed’s January meeting show that they’ve discussed slowing or pausing QT, especially since lawmakers haven’t reached a deal on the debt ceiling. “The argument for March is that the Fed has already talked about it,” said Blake Gwinn, head of US rates strategy at RBC Capital Markets. “So why not just do it? They can pause QT and restart it later.” A Bloomberg News survey shows most economists expect the Fed to keep rates steady through mid-2025, with two cuts in September and December. That’s a shift. Back in December, they expected three cuts starting in March. The change reflects uncertainty around Trump’s trade policies. The president has threatened tariffs against China, Canada, and Mexico. He’s also changed his stance multiple times, making it impossible for markets to price in risk. Investors don’t know what’s coming next, and that’s creating instability. “The Fed is in a very tough spot right now, facing a more stagflationary outlook even as core inflation remains well above its medium-term target,” said Scott Anderson, chief US economist at BMO Capital Markets. “Uncertainty around the magnitude, duration, and targets of future tariffs further complicates the monetary policy outlook.” Most economists don’t expect big changes to the Fed’s post-meeting statement. But some see the possibility of a slowdown in QT. Around 11% predict the Fed will ease up next week. Another 41% think that will happen in the second quarter. Trump’s policies could force the Fed to act sooner Looking ahead, the big question is how the Fed will react if inflation stays high while the economy slows. Nearly three-quarters of economists surveyed said they now expect weaker growth in 2025 due to Trump’s policies. Two-thirds now predict higher inflation. So far, Fed officials haven’t said much about how Trump’s policies will influence their decisions. They remain optimistic about the labor market but acknowledge inflation concerns. “The costs of being cautious are very, very low,” Powell said this month. “The economy’s fine. It doesn’t need us to do anything, really, and so we can wait and we should wait.” Most economists believe the Fed will hold rates steady if inflation remains high while growth slows. But if conditions worsen, some expect cuts to come sooner. “If our downside scenario plays out, the Fed will have to shift to focus on growth risks and could start to cut rates by Q3,” said Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide. She sees the first cut happening in October. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

The wild world of memecoins has delivered another rollercoaster ride, and this time, it’s a dizzying plunge. Just days ago, the crypto sphere was buzzing about a new token, WOLF of Wall St (WOLF), linked to none other than Hayden Davis, the co-creator of the infamous LIBRA project. But the initial excitement quickly turned to dismay as WOLF experienced a shocking memecoin crash , losing a staggering 99% of its value soon after launch. Let’s dive into the details of this dramatic crypto event and explore what it means for the volatile world of digital currencies. What Triggered the WOLF Token Memecoin Crash? According to reports from The Block, citing data from blockchain analytics platform Bubblemaps, the WOLF token saw its market capitalization briefly soar to nearly $43 million after its release on March 8th. However, this peak was incredibly short-lived. Almost immediately after reaching this high, the token began a rapid and relentless descent, resulting in a devastating memecoin crash . The speed and severity of the decline have raised eyebrows and sparked discussions about the nature of memecoin investments and the potential risks involved. Here’s a breakdown of the key events: Launch Date: March 8th Token Name: WOLF of Wall St (WOLF) Alleged Creator: Hayden Davis (LIBRA co-creator) Peak Market Cap (Briefly): Nearly $43 million Subsequent Plunge: 99% Data Source: Bubblemaps While the exact reasons behind the memecoin crash are still under scrutiny, typical factors contributing to such dramatic price drops in the memecoin market include: Pump-and-Dump Schemes: Memecoins, often driven by hype and social media buzz, are susceptible to pump-and-dump schemes. Early investors create artificial demand (the “pump”), attracting later investors, before selling off their holdings and causing a price collapse (the “dump”). Lack of Fundamental Value: Unlike established cryptocurrencies with underlying technology or use cases, memecoins often lack intrinsic value. Their price is primarily driven by speculation and community sentiment. High Volatility: The memecoin market is known for extreme volatility. Prices can surge and plummet rapidly, making them incredibly risky investments. Rug Pulls: In some cases, memecoin projects can be outright scams where developers abandon the project after raising funds, leaving investors with worthless tokens. Hayden Davis and the Shadow of a Crypto Scandal The involvement of Hayden Davis, known as a LIBRA co-creator , adds another layer of intrigue to this crypto scandal . LIBRA, the token purportedly linked to Argentine President Javier Milei, has already been a subject of controversy. Adding fuel to the fire, Argentine lawyer Gregorio Dalbon had previously requested an Interpol Red Notice against Davis. While the details surrounding this request are not explicitly linked to the WOLF token incident, it certainly casts a shadow over Davis’s involvement in the crypto space. Is this crypto scandal simply another case of memecoin volatility, or are there deeper issues at play? The connection to a figure like Hayden Davis, already facing legal scrutiny, raises questions about the legitimacy and intentions behind the WOLF token project. Investors are left wondering if this was an inevitable outcome or a deliberately orchestrated scheme. WOLF Token: A Cautionary Tale in the Memecoin Frenzy The dramatic memecoin crash of the WOLF token serves as a stark reminder of the risks associated with investing in highly speculative digital assets. While the allure of quick gains in the memecoin market is strong, the potential for significant losses is equally real. Here are some key takeaways from this event: Due Diligence is Crucial: Thorough research is essential before investing in any cryptocurrency, especially memecoins. Understand the project, its team (if known), and the underlying risks. Manage Risk Wisely: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Memecoins should be considered high-risk, high-reward investments, and portfolio allocation should reflect this. Be Wary of Hype: Memecoin prices are often driven by social media hype and influencer endorsements. Don’t let FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) cloud your judgment. Understand Tokenomics: Examine the token distribution, supply, and other tokenomics aspects. Look for red flags like a large percentage of tokens held by a small number of wallets. Consider Project Legitimacy: Assess the project’s legitimacy. Are the developers transparent? Is there a clear roadmap or purpose beyond hype? In the case of WOLF, the alleged creator’s background and prior controversies should have raised immediate concerns. The WOLF token collapse is not an isolated incident. The history of memecoins is littered with similar stories of rapid ascents followed by catastrophic falls. While some memecoins have provided early investors with substantial returns, many more have left investors holding worthless tokens. Navigating the Volatile Crypto Market The crypto market volatility is a double-edged sword. It presents opportunities for significant gains but also carries substantial risks. For those venturing into the world of memecoins, it’s crucial to approach with extreme caution and a clear understanding of the potential downsides. The WOLF token saga highlights the importance of informed decision-making and risk management in the fast-paced and often unpredictable cryptocurrency landscape. Here are some actionable insights for navigating crypto market volatility , particularly in the memecoin space: Actionable Insight Description Diversify Your Portfolio Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, especially not a memecoin basket. Spread your investments across different asset classes and cryptocurrency types. Set Realistic Expectations Understand that memecoin investments are highly speculative. Don’t expect to get rich quick, and be prepared for potential losses. Use Stop-Loss Orders Implement stop-loss orders to limit potential losses. This automatically sells your tokens if the price drops to a predetermined level. Stay Informed Keep up-to-date with crypto news and market trends. Be aware of potential scams and red flags. Consider Long-Term Investing If you’re risk-averse, focus on established cryptocurrencies with strong fundamentals and long-term growth potential rather than chasing memecoin hype. Conclusion: Lessons from the WOLF Token Debacle The WOLF token collapse serves as a dramatic and timely lesson in the perils of memecoin mania. The alleged involvement of LIBRA co-creator Hayden Davis and the swift 99% memecoin crash underscore the inherent risks in this speculative corner of the crypto market. While the dream of overnight riches may be tempting, the reality is that memecoin investments are fraught with danger. Investors must exercise extreme caution, conduct thorough due diligence, and manage risk responsibly to avoid becoming victims of the next crypto scandal or memecoin crash . The WOLF token’s fleeting moment in the spotlight is a powerful reminder: in the crypto world, what goes up fast can come down even faster.

The central bank cited Bitcoin’s high volatility as a major concern, warning that “transaction costs to cash out Bitcoins could rise drastically” if the crypto market experiences instability. Officials also pointed out that Bitcoin does not meet the International Monetary Fund’s criteria for foreign exchange reserves, which require assets to maintain liquidity, market stability, and a credit rating of investment grade or higher. Discussions around national crypto reserves have gained traction globally, especially following the U.S. government’s decision to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . Some countries, like Brazil and the Czech Republic , have even expressed openness to the idea. Yet, the Bank of Korea maintained that a “cautious approach” is necessary, noting that institutions like the European Central Bank, the Swiss National Bank, and Japan’s financial authorities share a similarly skeptical stance. The bank further clarified that it has neither reviewed nor formally discussed the possibility of incorporating Bitcoin into its reserves.

As previously reported by crypto.news, the Financial Services Commission has also taken a similar stance. In November, FSC Chairman Kim Byung-hwan acknowledged calls for a national Bitcoin reserve but dismissed the idea as premature However, South Korea has been gradually loosening its stance on crypto regulations. The country’s financial watchdog has been working on lifting restrictions on institutional crypto trading and is preparing a second legal framework focused on stablecoin oversight. Policymakers are also considering allowing crypto exchange-traded funds, which, according to the chairman of the Korea Exchange, could bring fresh opportunities to the country’s financial sector.

Reports suggest that President Donald Trump’s team is eyeing XRP as a key player in building a powerhouse Bitcoin (BTC) reserve. A new proposal submitted to the US SEC suggests that XRP could play a key role in boosting the US financial system. The plan claims that integrating XRP could unlock $1.5 trillion in liquidity, which could then be used to buy Bitcoin. However, this idea faces major regulatory hurdles, and it remains unclear if the government will take it seriously. How XRP Could Free Up Trapped Funds The five page proposal written by Maximilian Staudinger suggests that the US should consider using XRP to free up capital stuck in Nostro accounts. These accounts, used for cross-border transactions, hold about $27 trillion globally, with around $5 trillion belonging to US banks. By using XRP, Staudinger believes that $1.5 trillion could be released and redirected toward Bitcoin purchases. Staudinger also proposes a structured crypto reserve system for the US. He argues that Bitcoin should be at the center, while Solana and Cardano could be used for government applications. However, he insists that XRP is the most important asset for handling financial transactions. Bold Bitcoin Claims Raise Questions One of the more questionable parts of the proposal is the claim that the US could buy 25 million Bitcoin at $60,000 per coin. This is impossible since Bitcoin’s total supply is only 21 million. Still, the proposal argues that using XRP could save the US up to $7.5 billion in transaction fees annually and make government payments, like Social Security and tax refunds, faster and cheaper. Regulatory Challenges Stand in the Way Despite its ambitious plan, the proposal faces a big setback—XRP’s unclear regulatory status. Staudinger urges the SEC to classify XRP as a payment asset instead of a security. He also calls on the Department of Justice to lift restrictions preventing banks from using XRP. To speed things up, he suggests a presidential executive order to bypass regulatory delays. His plan includes two timelines: a standard 24-month rollout with standard regulatory approval, government payments, and bank adoption, or opting for a fast-track 6-12 month timeline using executive orders and Fed mandates for quick XRP integration. While ambitious, the fast-track approach could work given Ripple’s existing global liquidity network. Will This Proposal Go Anywhere? While the idea sounds interesting, independent proposals like this usually don’t gain much traction unless backed by major financial institutions or government officials. Without strong support, this remains a bold idea rather than a plan the US is likely to adopt anytime soon.",News|Crypto Scam,EN,0,0,XRP|BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|FIAT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-17 05:55:31

It feels like just yesterday we were introduced to a promising new layer-1 blockchain, and now, Solana is blowing out five candles! That’s right, Solana is celebrating its fifth anniversary, and the numbers are nothing short of staggering. If you’ve been following the crypto space, you know Solana has been making waves, but the scale of its achievements might still surprise you. Let’s dive into what makes this milestone so remarkable and what it means for the future of this dynamic blockchain. Solana’s Remarkable 5-Year Journey: A Blockchain Revolution Five years in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency is an eternity, and Solana has certainly made the most of it. From its mainnet beta launch in March 2020, Solana has rapidly evolved into a powerhouse in the blockchain landscape. In a recent post on X, Solana highlighted some mind-blowing statistics that underscore its growth and impact: Over 408 Billion Transactions: Yes, you read that right – billion with a ‘B’! This colossal number speaks volumes about the sheer volume of activity happening on the Solana network. It’s a testament to Solana’s high throughput and scalability. More Than 1,300 Validators: A robust and decentralized network needs strong validators, and Solana boasts a community of over 1,300 of them. This decentralized validator set is crucial for network security and resilience. Over $987 Billion in DEX Trading Volume: Approaching the trillion-dollar mark, the decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume on Solana is astronomical. This highlights Solana’s significant role in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. These aren’t just numbers; they represent real-world usage, adoption, and the vibrant ecosystem that has flourished around Solana. And as Solana itself declared, “just getting started,” hinting at even greater things to come. Decoding Solana’s Explosive Transaction Growth: What’s the Secret Sauce? 408 billion transactions – it’s a number that begs the question: how did Solana achieve such phenomenal transaction growth? The answer lies in Solana’s innovative approach to blockchain technology. Unlike some of the earlier blockchains, Solana was designed from the ground up for speed and scalability. Here are some key factors contributing to its impressive transaction processing capabilities: Proof of History (PoH): This is Solana’s groundbreaking innovation. PoH provides a historical record that proves an event occurred at a specific moment in time. It works alongside Proof of Stake (PoS) to drastically increase transaction throughput without compromising security. Think of it as a cryptographic clock that orders transactions, making consensus much faster. High Throughput Architecture: Solana’s architecture is engineered for high performance. It leverages features like Turbine, Gulf Stream, Sea Level, Pipelining, Cloudbreak, and Archivers, all working in concert to optimize transaction processing and network efficiency. Low Transaction Fees: Speed is great, but affordability is equally crucial. Solana is renowned for its incredibly low transaction fees, often a fraction of a cent. This makes it incredibly attractive for users and applications that require frequent transactions, from DeFi trading to micro-payments. To put it into perspective, let’s compare Solana to some other prominent blockchains: Blockchain Transactions Per Second (TPS) (Approximate) Average Transaction Fee (Approximate) Solana Thousands Extremely Low ( Ethereum 15-30 Variable, Can be High ($1 – $10+) Bitcoin 7 Variable, Can be Moderate to High ($1 – $5+) *Note: TPS and fees are approximate and can fluctuate based on network conditions. As you can see, Solana stands out with its high TPS and remarkably low fees, making it a compelling choice for a wide range of applications. The Power of Solana’s Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Trading Volume: A DeFi Hotspot Nearly a trillion dollars in DEX trading volume – that’s a massive figure! It firmly establishes Solana as a major player in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) arena. But what does this DEX volume really signify? It indicates a vibrant and active DeFi ecosystem built on Solana. Here’s why this is significant: Thriving DeFi Applications: High DEX volume is a direct result of numerous successful and popular DeFi applications (DApps) being built on Solana. These include decentralized exchanges like Raydium, Orca, and Serum, lending platforms, yield aggregators, and more. Liquidity and Capital Efficiency: Large DEX volume indicates deep liquidity within the Solana DeFi ecosystem. This is crucial for traders and investors as it allows for efficient and seamless trading of digital assets. Growing User Adoption: Significant DEX activity reflects increasing user adoption of Solana for DeFi activities. People are actively using Solana to swap tokens, participate in yield farming, and engage in various DeFi strategies. Innovation in DeFi: Solana’s technical capabilities enable the development of more sophisticated and innovative DeFi products and services that might be challenging to implement on slower or more expensive blockchains. Solana’s low fees and high speed are particularly beneficial for DeFi, where users often perform multiple transactions. Whether it’s frequent trading, yield optimization strategies, or participating in new DeFi protocols, Solana provides a cost-effective and efficient environment. Solana’s Thriving Ecosystem: Validators and Community at its Heart Beyond the impressive transaction numbers and DEX volume, the strength of any blockchain lies in its community and infrastructure. Solana’s ecosystem is powered by over 1,300 validators, playing a critical role in maintaining the network’s integrity and security. Why are validators so important? Network Security: Validators participate in the consensus mechanism, verifying transactions and adding new blocks to the blockchain. Their collective effort ensures the network remains secure and resistant to attacks. Decentralization: A large and geographically diverse validator set enhances the decentralization of the Solana network. This reduces the risk of censorship and single points of failure. Network Uptime and Reliability: Validators contribute to the continuous operation of the Solana network, ensuring high uptime and reliability for users and applications. Community Governance: Validators often participate in network governance decisions, contributing to the evolution and improvement of the Solana protocol. Furthermore, Solana boasts a vibrant and growing developer and user community. This community is constantly building new applications, contributing to open-source projects, and driving innovation within the Solana ecosystem. The active community is a vital ingredient in Solana’s continued success. Looking Ahead: Solana’s Anniversary and the Future of Blockchain Innovation As Solana celebrates its fifth anniversary, it’s not just about looking back at past achievements but also looking forward to the future. The “just getting started” message is a powerful indicator of Solana’s ambitions. What can we expect from Solana in the coming years? Continued Network Upgrades: Solana is known for its rapid development and continuous network improvements. We can anticipate further optimizations to enhance scalability, security, and functionality. Expansion of the Ecosystem: Expect to see even more diverse and innovative applications being built on Solana, spanning DeFi, NFTs, gaming, and potentially new sectors we haven’t even imagined yet. Mainstream Adoption: Solana’s speed and low fees position it well for mainstream adoption. As blockchain technology becomes more integrated into everyday life, Solana is poised to play a significant role. Addressing Challenges: Like any technology, Solana faces challenges, including network congestion during peak times and the ongoing need to balance decentralization with performance. The Solana team and community are actively working on solutions to these challenges. Solana’s journey over the past five years has been nothing short of explosive. It has demonstrated the potential of high-performance blockchains and has become a key infrastructure layer for the burgeoning decentralized web. With its impressive transaction volume, thriving DeFi ecosystem, and dedicated community, Solana is not just celebrating an anniversary; it’s showcasing a revolution in blockchain technology. Happy 5th Anniversary, Solana! The future of blockchain looks brighter with you in it.

Lara Lea Trump dedicated an entire episode to the future of digital assets, featuring none other than Strategy’s chairman Michael Saylor, President Donald Trump, White House Crypto Czar David Sacks, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Saylor took center stage, sharing how he stumbled upon Bitcoin and how it changed his company’s fate. He later posted , “On Sunday night, Fox News’ hit show My View with Lara Lea Trump was devoted to Bitcoin and digital assets, using the words of Donald Trump, Crypto Czar David Sacks, Treasury Sec Scott Bessent, and yours truly to educate its mainstream audience on the power and promise of this new technology.” Trump’s Bitcoin vision and economic policies take focus The episode opened with Lara addressing the economic wreckage of the past four years—inflation, rising debt, and federal spending. She blamed the Biden-Harris administration for increasing spending by $300 billion in its final months. The national debt now stands at $36 trillion, with high interest rates squeezing businesses and taxpayers alike. Then, Donald Trump’s voice took over. He declared, “We are going to take in hundreds of billions of dollars… become so rich you won’t know where to spend that money.” He promised a Bitcoin-friendly future, calling it “America’s next big industry”. The show highlighted 10,000 manufacturing jobs added in February, and $115 billion cut in wasteful spending. Trump claimed this was just the beginning. “Last year, I promised to make America the Bitcoin superpower of the world,” he said, doubling down on plans to integrate Bitcoin into the national economy. Viewers had questions. A caller from India, Stefan, asked, “What are your hopes for crypto under a second Trump administration?” Lara responded, “My hopes are likely the same as yours—for American prosperity to thrive once again.” She reinforced Trump’s vision, saying America must lead in Bitcoin innovation. Michael Saylor gave the audience a Bitcoin reality check, as he explained in the snippet why it’s the strongest financial asset on the planet and why governments need to take it seriously. “We realized the dollar was inflating, and cash was losing value. Bitcoin is the only asset that holds purchasing power long-term,” said Saylor. A segment of the My View episode featured everyday people reacting to Bitcoin. Many admitted they didn’t understand it, some called it “sketchy”, while others said they were long-term holders waiting for big gains. Lara sent a team to New York City to ask regular people what they thought about crypto. Some were skeptical. Others were already deep in the game. One man summed it up: “I don’t understand Bitcoin, but I know one thing—banks aren’t my friend. If Bitcoin gives me freedom, I’ll take it.” Another said, “I bought crypto years ago, and I’m holding. In ten or twenty years, we’ll see where it goes.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

Last week, markets were rattled by US President Trump’s abrupt tariff announcements, but there was a little reprieve after encouraging inflation data with the CPI report coming in below expectations. However, the Consumer Sentiment Index continued its three-month slide, falling to its lowest level since November 2022 as recession fears mount. “Wednesday marks the second Fed interest rate decision of 2025, at a pivotal point in time,” commented the Kobeissi Letter. Economic Events March 17 to 21 February’s Retail Sales report will be released on Monday, offering insights into the amount of money consumers are spending on both durable and non-durable goods. This data is a leading indicator of the economy’s overall health and inflationary factors on the demand side. There are reports for industrial production showing the volume of production of US industries like manufacturing, mining, utilities, and housing starting figures on Tuesday; however, these have a low impact. All eyes will be on the US central bank on Wednesday as policymakers are widely expected to keep interest rates flat at the policy meeting. Fed officials are reluctant to make any monetary policy moves while they wait to see the effect of Trump’s economic policies. According to the CME Fed Watch tool , there is a 99% chance that rates will remain unchanged at 4.25% to $4.5%. Key Events This Week: 1. February Retail Sales data – Monday 2.

Crypto Market Outlook Crypto market capitalization has shrunk by a further 3.3% on the day in a fall to $2.8 trillion at the time of writing, with declines accelerating during Monday morning trading in Asia. Bitcoin dipped to $82,000 before recovering slightly to reclaim $83,000 at the time of writing. The asset remains down almost 11% over the past fortnight. Ethereum remains in bear market territory, having fallen below $1,900 again and with very few signs of recovery.

The Department of Justice charged Ver with mail fraud , tax evasion and filing false tax returns in April 2024, alleging he hid the amount of Bitcoin ( BTC ) he owned when he renounced his US citizenship in 2014 and defrauded the Internal Revenue Service out of $48 million by failing to report the gains he made through selling them. Sharing more re the call to dismiss the prosecution against Roger Ver @PamBondi @elonmusk @realDonaldTrump @Davewarrington https://t.co/BckQwEXBW6 — marla maples (@itsmarlamaples) March 16, 2025 Maples and Trump met in the mid-1980s during his first marriage to Ivana Trump, and was his second wife from 1993 until 1999. She has long been involved with philanthropy and has advocated for multiple charities and causes. She is seemingly still close to and supportive of Trump, who together have a daughter, Tiffany Trump. Maples attended Trump’s inauguration and told the London Evening Standard in July that she was “open to whatever way that I can serve” the then-presidential bidder. Maples joins a host of high-profile figures calling to stop the prosecution of Ver, which includes Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and online black market Silk Road creator Ross Ulbricht, who was facing a double life sentence in prison until Trump pardoned him in January. Ver has appealed to Trump for a pardon, claiming he is being unfairly persecuted and is a victim of “lawfare.” Neither Trump nor the White House has publicly acknowledged Ver’s plea, but Trump’s cost-cutting czar Musk said in a January X post that Ver “gave up his US citizenship. No pardon for Ver. Membership has its privileges.” Related: Roger Ver’s Trump pardon plea: ‘Lawfare’ victim or tax evader? Ver was arrested in Spain at the time of the US indictment pending his extradition to the US but was later granted bail on the condition he remain in the country. He moved to dismiss the government’s case in December, arguing the charges were unconstitutional, and the IRS’ “exit tax” for renounced citizens is “inscrutably vague” when applied to crypto.

South Korea's Central Bank Rejects Bitcoin Reserves, Citing Volatility In response to a written question from a member of the National Assembly Strategy and Finance Committee, the Central Bank announced that it does not consider Bitcoin as a reserve asset. The central bank stressed that the significant transaction costs associated with converting Bitcoin into cash could pose a risk to financial stability. Additionally, the South Korean central bank referred to the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) guidelines on foreign exchange reserve management, which emphasize prudent control of liquidity, market and credit risks. Discussions regarding national Bitcoin reserves gained momentum after US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on March 6 to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve using BTC seized from criminal and civil cases. While Trump’s move has led many countries to explore the idea of holding Bitcoin reserves, South Korea remains skeptical. The central bank’s position aligns with Japan, Switzerland and the European Central Bank, which have all been wary of accepting Bitcoin as part of their foreign exchange reserves. Despite rejecting Bitcoin as a reserve asset, South Korea is taking steps to ease strict crypto regulations. The country’s financial authorities are gradually lifting restrictions on institutional crypto trading and are currently preparing a second legal framework focused on stablecoin regulation. As South Korea balances crypto market growth with regulatory oversight, debate over Bitcoin’s role in national reserves is likely to continue. *This is not investment advice.

In a stunning turn of events, North Korea has reportedly ascended to the ranks of a major Bitcoin holder, securing the third-largest government position globally. Yes, you read that right. While nations worldwide grapple with crypto regulation and adoption, it appears North Korea has been quietly amassing a significant digital fortune. Let’s dive into the details of this surprising development and explore what it means for the future of cryptocurrency and global geopolitics. Shocking North Korea Bitcoin Holdings Revealed According to a recent report by Bitcoin.com, leveraging data from the esteemed Arkham Intelligence, North Korea now holds the third-largest stash of Bitcoin among governments worldwide. This revelation is based on the identified holdings of the Lazarus Group, a notorious hacking collective with ties to North Korea. Arkham Intelligence’s meticulous on-chain analysis pinpoints the Lazarus Group as possessing a staggering 13,562 BTC. This places North Korea ahead of nations like Bhutan and El Salvador in the government Bitcoin holdings race, painting a fascinating, if not slightly concerning, picture of global crypto distribution. But how does this compare to other nations? Let’s take a look at the top players in the government Bitcoin holding arena: Rank Government Bitcoin Holdings (BTC) 1 United States 198,109 2 United Kingdom 61,245 3 North Korea 13,562 4 Bhutan 10,635 5 El Salvador 6,117 As you can see, the United States and the United Kingdom dwarf other nations in their Bitcoin reserves. However, North Korea’s position at number three is undeniably noteworthy, especially considering the nation’s isolated economic and political standing on the global stage. This data underscores the diverse and sometimes unexpected ways in which Bitcoin is being adopted and utilized by different entities around the world. Decoding Government Bitcoin Holdings: Why North Korea? The question that naturally arises is: why is North Korea accumulating Bitcoin, and how did they amass such a significant amount? The answer, according to the report, lies with the Lazarus Group. This hacking collective, infamous for its cybercriminal activities, is believed to be responsible for numerous high-profile crypto heists, including the recent breach of the crypto exchange Bybit. It’s suspected that the Bitcoin held by North Korea is largely derived from these illicit activities. This raises several critical points about the nature of government Bitcoin holdings and the methods of acquisition: Sanctions Evasion: North Korea faces stringent international sanctions due to its nuclear weapons program. Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, offer a potential avenue to bypass these sanctions and access the global financial system. Funding State Operations: The funds obtained through cybercrime and cryptocurrency holdings could be used to finance various state operations, including military programs and government initiatives. Decentralized Finance Advantage: Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and relative anonymity make it an attractive tool for nations seeking to operate outside the traditional financial framework. Economic Strategy: In a nation with limited access to international trade and finance, Bitcoin could be viewed as a strategic asset and a store of value, albeit a volatile one. Lazarus Group Crypto Activities and Bybit Breach The Lazarus Group’s role in North Korea’s Bitcoin adoption strategy cannot be overstated. This sophisticated hacking organization has been linked to numerous cyberattacks targeting financial institutions and cryptocurrency exchanges globally. Their modus operandi often involves sophisticated phishing campaigns, malware deployment, and exploiting vulnerabilities in exchange security systems. The recent breach of Bybit, a prominent crypto exchange, further highlights Lazarus Group’s ongoing and impactful operations within the crypto sphere. The implications of Lazarus Group’s activities are far-reaching: Increased Scrutiny on Crypto Exchanges: Incidents like the Bybit breach underscore the need for robust security measures and enhanced vigilance within the cryptocurrency exchange ecosystem. Geopolitical Cybersecurity Concerns: State-sponsored cybercrime, particularly for financial gain, raises significant geopolitical cybersecurity concerns and necessitates international cooperation to combat these threats. Reputational Risks for Crypto: The association of cryptocurrency with illicit activities, such as those attributed to Lazarus Group, can negatively impact the overall perception and mainstream adoption of crypto assets. The Broader Picture: Bitcoin Adoption and Crypto Regulation North Korea’s emergence as a significant Bitcoin holder is just one facet of the evolving global crypto landscape. Across the world, governments are grappling with how to regulate, manage, and potentially leverage cryptocurrencies. While some nations, like El Salvador, have embraced Bitcoin as legal tender, others remain cautious, citing concerns about volatility, money laundering, and illicit financing. The situation with North Korea adds another layer of complexity to the ongoing discussions around crypto regulation : Regulatory Challenges: How can international regulatory bodies effectively address the use of cryptocurrency by sanctioned nations and cybercriminal organizations? Transparency and Traceability: Enhancing the transparency and traceability of cryptocurrency transactions is crucial to deter illicit activities, but also raises privacy concerns. International Cooperation: Combating crypto-related crime and illicit financing requires robust international cooperation and information sharing between governments and law enforcement agencies. Innovation vs. Security: Striking a balance between fostering innovation in the crypto space and ensuring security and regulatory compliance remains a key challenge for policymakers worldwide. Navigating the Future of Crypto and Global Finance The revelation of North Korea’s substantial Bitcoin holdings serves as a stark reminder of the multifaceted nature of cryptocurrency and its growing influence on the global stage. It highlights both the potential benefits and inherent risks associated with decentralized digital currencies. As governments and institutions continue to navigate the complexities of crypto regulation and adoption, the case of North Korea underscores the urgent need for international dialogue, enhanced cybersecurity measures, and a balanced approach that fosters innovation while mitigating risks. The crypto world is constantly evolving, and stories like this one demonstrate just how dynamic and unpredictable it can be.

Crypto exchange OKX has taken swift action, announcing the temporary suspension of its decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator service. This decisive move comes in response to the detection of a cyberattack attempt attributed to the infamous North Korean Lazarus Group. Let’s delve into the details of this developing situation and understand what it means for crypto users and the broader industry. Why Did OKX Suspend its DEX Aggregator? The primary reason behind OKX ‘s suspension of its DEX aggregator service is the detection of a security threat. The exchange identified an attack attempt originating from the Lazarus Group, a notorious cybercriminal organization with a history of targeting financial institutions and cryptocurrency platforms. Recognizing the potential risks, OKX proactively chose to halt the service to safeguard user assets and platform integrity. This immediate response highlights the critical importance of robust security measures in the crypto space. Here’s a breakdown of the key factors leading to this decision: Detection of Lazarus Group Attack: OKX’s security systems flagged suspicious activity linked to the Lazarus Group, prompting immediate investigation. Proactive Security Measure: To prevent potential exploitation and protect user funds, OKX opted for a temporary suspension of the DEX aggregator. System Updates: The suspension allows OKX to implement significant updates to its security infrastructure, enhancing its defenses against sophisticated threats. Collaboration for Enhanced Security: OKX is actively working with blockchain explorers to improve address labeling and threat intelligence. What is a DEX Aggregator and Why is it Important? For those new to the crypto world, understanding what a DEX aggregator does is crucial. A DEX aggregator is a platform that combines liquidity from multiple decentralized exchanges (DEXs) into one interface. This offers users several advantages: Better Prices: By sourcing liquidity from various DEXs, aggregators can find the best possible prices for trades, reducing slippage and maximizing returns. Convenience: Users can access multiple DEXs through a single platform, simplifying the trading process and eliminating the need to navigate different interfaces. Increased Liquidity: Aggregators pool liquidity, making it easier to execute larger trades and access a wider range of tokens. However, DEX aggregators, like any platform in the crypto space, are not immune to security risks. The interconnected nature of these services means that vulnerabilities in one area can potentially be exploited. This incident with OKX underscores the ongoing need for vigilance and continuous improvement in crypto exchange security protocols. Lazarus Group: Understanding the Cyber Threat The Lazarus Group is not just another run-of-the-mill hacking group. Attributed to North Korea, this organization is known for its sophisticated and persistent cyberattacks, often aimed at generating revenue for the regime. They have been linked to numerous high-profile cybercrimes, including: Bank Heists: Lazarus Group is notorious for targeting banks and financial institutions globally, attempting to steal funds through cyber intrusions. Cryptocurrency Theft: They have become increasingly active in targeting cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets, siphoning off digital assets. Ransomware Attacks: While less frequent, Lazarus has also been associated with ransomware campaigns, further highlighting their diverse cybercriminal activities. Their tactics are constantly evolving, making them a persistent and dangerous threat in the cybersecurity landscape. The fact that OKX detected and responded to an attempted attack from this group speaks to the seriousness of the situation and the importance of proactive security measures in the security of digital assets. OKX’s Enhanced Security Measures: What’s New? In response to the Lazarus Group incident and as part of its ongoing commitment to user safety, OKX is implementing several enhanced security features. These measures are designed to create a more robust and secure trading environment. Let’s explore some of the key updates: Illegal IP Blocking: OKX is now actively blocking access from IP addresses associated with illicit activities and high-risk regions, adding an extra layer of defense against unauthorized access. Real-time Black Address Detection: The exchange has implemented systems for real-time detection of blacklisted addresses, helping to prevent transactions with known malicious entities. Blockchain Explorer Collaboration: Working with blockchain explorers to optimize incomplete labeling is crucial for identifying and tracking suspicious transactions more effectively. This collaboration enhances transparency and aids in investigations. Security System Updates: Beyond these specific features, OKX is undertaking significant updates to its overall security system, strengthening its infrastructure against evolving cyber threats. These proactive steps demonstrate OKX’s dedication to maintaining a secure platform and protecting its users from sophisticated cyberattacks. The focus on preventative measures and collaboration within the crypto community is a positive sign for the industry as a whole. What Does This Mean for Crypto Users? The temporary suspension of OKX’s DEX aggregator service and the detection of the Lazarus Group attack serve as a stark reminder of the ongoing security challenges in the cryptocurrency space. For crypto users, this situation underscores several important points: Security is Paramount: Always prioritize security when choosing a crypto exchange or platform. Look for exchanges with a strong track record of security measures and proactive responses to threats. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with security news and announcements from exchanges and the broader crypto industry. Awareness is a crucial first step in protecting your assets. Diversification of Risk: Consider diversifying your holdings across multiple exchanges and wallets to mitigate the impact of a potential security breach on any single platform. Utilize Security Features: Take advantage of security features offered by exchanges, such as two-factor authentication (2FA), address whitelisting, and security alerts. While the news of a cyberattack attempt can be concerning, OKX’s swift and transparent response is a positive example of how exchanges are evolving to meet these challenges. The ongoing battle against cyber threats in the crypto world requires constant vigilance and innovation. Looking Ahead: The Future of Crypto Exchange Security The incident with OKX and the Lazarus Group highlights the continuous need for advancement in crypto exchange security. As the crypto industry matures and becomes more mainstream, attracting both legitimate users and malicious actors, security will remain a top priority. We can expect to see further developments in areas such as: Advanced Threat Intelligence: Exchanges will increasingly rely on sophisticated threat intelligence to proactively identify and mitigate potential attacks. AI and Machine Learning: Artificial intelligence and machine learning will play a growing role in detecting and responding to cyber threats in real-time. Decentralized Security Solutions: Innovations in decentralized security technologies may offer new approaches to safeguarding crypto assets and platforms. Industry Collaboration: Increased collaboration and information sharing among exchanges, blockchain explorers, and cybersecurity firms will be essential to combatting sophisticated threats like the Lazarus Group. OKX’s response to this incident, including the suspension of its DEX aggregator and the implementation of enhanced security measures, sets a positive precedent for the industry. It demonstrates a commitment to user safety and a proactive approach to addressing evolving cyber threats. As the crypto landscape continues to grow, such vigilance and responsiveness will be crucial for building trust and ensuring the long-term sustainability of the industry. Conclusion: Secure Crypto is a Shared Responsibility The temporary suspension of OKX’s DEX aggregator service due to the Lazarus Group attack attempt is a stark reminder of the ever-present security challenges in the cryptocurrency world. However, it also showcases the proactive measures that exchanges like OKX are taking to protect their users. By enhancing security systems, collaborating with blockchain explorers, and implementing features like illegal IP blocking and real-time black address detection, OKX is reinforcing its commitment to a secure trading environment. For crypto users, this incident serves as a crucial lesson in prioritizing security, staying informed, and taking proactive steps to safeguard their digital assets. The pursuit of secure crypto is a shared responsibility, requiring vigilance and collaboration across the entire ecosystem.

Key stakeholders have been selling, and the custody of even more Bitcoin seems to have been passed from just a few hands to many. Substantial outflows from the wallets of significant holders—those with even just 100 BTC to 1,000 BTC stashed inside—have shown, in private chats seen by Decrypt, that these trusted holders—who have long seemed to backstop the price of Bitcoin—have not been in the mood of late to, you know, backstop the price of Bitcoin. Mid-Sized Holders Lead the Way in Bitcoin Dumping The data spotlight a striking phenomenon in Bitcoin’s marketplace over the last week. Wallets that hold between 100 and 1,000 BTC have been sending a substantial amount of the cryptocurrency into the marketplace, with 50,625 BTC having been sold over the last week. Those sales were worth about $4.07 billion. Meanwhile, the wallets that hold between 10 and 100 BTC have also been feeling the urge to sell, with those wallets sending another 7,062 BTC into the marketplace, worth about $567.1 million. So, mid-sized Bitcoin holders are definitely driving the current selling pressure. Bitcoin's key stakeholders are showing signs of dumping: Wallets with 100-1,000 $BTC : -50,625 Bitcoin (-$4.07B) in the past week Wallets with 10-100 $BTC : -7,062 Bitcoin (-$567.1M) in the past week Over the long-term, markets tend to fluctuate with a mid-sized… pic.twitter.com/jSioi9mzuS — Santiment (@santimentfeed) March 13, 2025 A market that remains sensitive to supply and demand fluctuations can feel the impact of the actions of these wallet tiers on Bitcoin’s price. In the long run, we have seen a nearly direct relationship between the price of Bitcoin and the market’s behavior when it comes to these mid-sized holders. If they decide to for whatever reason sell off their assets, it can— and mostly tends to— trigger wider market movements and lead to a price drop. Short-Term Holders Contributing to Market Weakness The concerns are compounded by what short-term Bitcoin holders are doing. These are people who have held the asset for one to three months. Since February, the short-term holders have taken $100 billion in losses. Adding insult to injury, these holders are selling—often at a loss—and this is putting more downward pressure on the already fragile Bitcoin price. It is clear that a significant number of these holders have decided to exit their positions. Market sentiment has shifted from a bullish outlook to one that is cautious and perhaps even fearful. Short-term $BTC holders (1-3 months) have dumped $100B in realized losses since February—selling at a loss and adding pressure to the market. Prices could dip further, but their exit might be clearing out weak hands. If long-term holders step in, this could be a pivotal shift… pic.twitter.com/ntGy18W7g4 — Kyledoops (@kyledoops) March 14, 2025 Currently, a significant factor contributing to the downturn of the Bitcoin market is the selling of the cryptocurrency by short-term holders at a loss. Often referred to in the cryptocurrency community as ‘weak hands,’ these individuals may be selling out of fear or uncertainty about Bitcoin’s forthcoming price movements. Still, they might also be selling for more positive reasons; namely, their selling could be part of an overall cleansing of the speculative market for Bitcoin. Potential for Further Price Declines Even more, by mid-sized and short-term holders exerting pressure on Bitcoin, we could see its price drop in the next few days or weeks. The market may react to the offloading of these larger stakeholders by seeing even more selling pressure. In this scenario, further Bitcoin depreciation seems likely. Nevertheless, the departure of the weaker hands is not in and of itself a bad thing for Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. After the market has stabilized post-sell-off, there may be a chance for not just a recovery but for a scenario seen all too often in Bitcoin’s storied past: a price floor followed by an upward spike. This is not something that strange companies like Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan should be cheering for, or that we should be cheering for, either. Enabling Bitcoin to be a better store of value and a better medium of exchange should be the end game. A Shift in Sentiment: Could Long-Term Holders Save the Market? The crucial question now is whether Bitcoin’s dip will be bought up by long-term holders who will step in to stabilize the market. Long-term holders—that is, folks who have had Bitcoin for over a year—are generally less impacted by the kind of price fluctuations that we see in the market lately. If these holders start to accumulate more Bitcoin during this dip, it could mark a crucial change in the sentiment surrounding Bitcoin. Considering Bitcoin’s history of price movement cycles, one can discern that the long-term holders of the digital asset have, on many occasions, been the prime movers in recovering the Bitcoin price after it (not too infrequently) plummets. With the current Bitcoin price at $20,000—this after it was at an all-time high of about $900 in December 2017—one can muse on the price recovery potential of the asset in light of its history. Conclusion: Bitcoin Faces Uncertainty, But a Rebound Is Possible To sum up, the Bitcoin market is under substantial pressure, with key stakeholders like mid-sized and short-term holders appearing to dump their assets. The combined selling activity has led to some sizable losses and has pushed Bitcoin’s price down even further. On the other hand, seeing weaker hands exit might clear the way for a Bitcoin market rebound—if, of course, long-term holders now step in to provide support. Currently, the market is uncertain; however, this period of volatility may provide an opportunity for long-term investors who believe in Bitcoin to invest. If these investors start accumulating Bitcoin at lower prices, it may help signal the start of a new upward trend and provide much-needed stability to the market. As ever, market watchers will need to keep a close eye on things, as a crucial next few weeks could very well decide Bitcoin’s price path for the balance of the year. The question is: will the HODLers step in and restore market confidence, or will the market be driven deeper into correction by further selling pressures?

41796286,https://nulltx.com/?p=147112,1742196241,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Ethereum’s Sentiment Decline: A Potential for an Unexpected Breakout Amid Market Caution,https://nulltx.com/ethereums-sentiment-decline-a-potential-for-an-unexpected-breakout-amid-market-caution/,"Ethereum , the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has been witnessing a steady decline in sentiment within the crypto community over recent months. The price of Ethereum (ETH), as per the latest data, stands at $1,865, a level not seen in over a year’s time. This drop in valuation, tied up with the rise in uncertainty and fear, has kept talks alive about the potential for an unexpected breakout. Negative sentiment and market FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) have gotten people talking about the next cryptocurrency likely to fail. Yet, could Ethereum be the one caught in the crosshairs next? This article considers some reasons for a potential rally in the price of ETH. The crypto community's sentiment toward Ethereum continues to drop more and more over time. The #2 market cap's value sits at $1,865 at the time of this writing, and the more FUD that continues to show, the better the argument gets for an eventual unexpected $ETH breakout. pic.twitter.com/FZmTddEDFy — Santiment (@santimentfeed) March 13, 2025 The Downtrend and Current Market Sentiment The price of Ethereum has retreated sharply, reaching depths not seen in more than a year. This drop has surfaced some pretty unsavory speculation about our favorite smart contract platform, with a number of investors and market analysts now arguing that it could be on the cusp of even steeper losses. In a recent conversation, my buddy Sander van de Haar—the head of ZENIQ and a former senior portfolio manager at exactus—reflected on this situation and some of the other factors and data points that have come into play over the last week. Yet, when negative sentiment floods the crypto space, quite the opposite effect can take place—a setup for an unexpected breakout. An overly bearish market can reverse like a runaway bull. Participants in that space may have already exhausted the worst-case scenarios when pricing BTC or ETH. Those two cryptos may be coiling up for an event-driven breakout, and that event doesn’t necessarily have to involve a change in price for either crypto. Even though the price of Ethereum is under pressure, the amount of liquidations in the market has been moderate when compared to downturns we’ve seen in the past. This indicates that although a good number of investors are playing it safe and being somewhat cautious, they are not, in fact, panicking. Instead, they seem to be preferring to remain quite still and making no moves of any sort until they receive a clear signal to do something—either to buy or to sell. A Cautious Stance Amid Global Uncertainty Recently, the overall market shift toward caution is one of the main reasons for Ethereum’s poor performance. Data from IntoTheBlock show a marked drop in high-risk loans on decentralized lending platforms. These are loan agreements between investors and DeFi users in which the lenders are assuming a lot of risk. It’s clear now that a lot of crypto investors are assuming a risk-off posture that has them pulling back from these high-stakes agreements. Why? Because with global macro concerns multiplying by the day, they just don’t feel very secure about putting their money to work in riskier assets. And these concerns are affecting more than just crypto investors and lending platforms. When major matters such as these appear, investors become risk-averse. This is when they seek safer investments instead of taking wild risks with assets like Ethereum, which is much more prone to ups and downs. With the global economy in such an uncertain state and the ongoing regulatory examination of all things crypto, the pullback from risky positions all around seems likely to continue. The caution is particularly clear in the Ethereum market, where holders of the asset express increasing concern about its future. Those holders, who typically think of Ethereum as amounting to a kind of long-term, low-risk investment, are not only worried about further price declines but are also starting to envision the worst-case scenarios—possible disruptions to the market and even the network itself. This sentiment has led to not only a contraction in the apparent overall adoption of Ethereum but also a contraction in the number of actual users of the network. Ethereum’s Potential Target of $1,250 The ongoing market dynamics, coupled with the weakening investor sentiment, have ignited talks about the chances of Ethereum making a further descent. Should Ethereum’s price continue in this downward spiral, some analysts see the potential target as low as $1,250—a level to which they are pointing after Ethereum broke out of a parallel channel. #Ethereum $ETH targets $1,250 after breaking out from this parallel channel! pic.twitter.com/XS3N9p8Unr — Ali (@ali_charts) March 14, 2025 Taking this step would serve to strengthen the notion among investors that Ethereum is currently involved in a long-term bear market. Ethereum’s flows into spot ETFs have shown a trend downward over the past few months, indicating that institutional interest in the asset and in asset-based funds is trending downward too. This is all part of a broader narrative in play right now. March 13 saw a total net outflow from Ethereum spot ETFs of $73.63 million. This is significant not just because of the amount involved but also because it underscores a trend of just not having that much capital coming back to Ethereum. On March 13, the total net outflow of Bitcoin spot ETF was 143 million US dollars, the net inflow of BlackRock ETF IBIT was 45.7467 million US dollars, and the total net outflow of Ethereum spot ETF was 73.6289 million US dollars. https://t.co/59u0BnEqLG — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 14, 2025 Looking Ahead: Is a Breakout Possible? Even though Ethereum presently has a depressed sentiment, moderate liquidations, and macro uncertainties to deal with, there is a reason for optimism. The decline in high-risk loans along with relatively stable liquidations suggests that market participants are not in a state of panic. If this is the case, then it’s a sign that Ethereum could be basing for a potential reversal. In the crypto space, sentiment often plays a pivotal part in deciding price directions. The currently prevailing bearish sentiment could very well act as a catalyst for a surprise bullish breakout, especially if the Ethereum ecosystem were to have some positive developments or news. If Ethereum can work its way around the current overlay of macroeconomic troubles and regulatory concerns, it might recapture past peak prices in what could feel like a blast from the Ethereum past. At this point, though, Ethereum’s price is still in a delicate condition, with a bearish target of $1,250 hanging over it. A lot of the price action will probably come down to what the Ethereum Foundation and related developers do to either improve or kind of keep things as they are now within the Ethereum network. But market sentiment in the overall crypto space is also up for grabs and could shift in either direction contingent on any number of as-yet-unfolded macroeconomic developments. Conclusion Ethereum’s recent drop in sentiment and price mirrors the more widespread problems of the cryptocurrency market, with complex macroeconomic uncertainties taking a toll on investor interest and enthusiasm. However, the relative calm of on-chain data gathered from Ethereum seems to suggest that long-term holders are mostly content… and part of a near-constant accumulation of Ethereum. This context certainly allows for the possibility that Ethereum could break out unexpectedly in the near term, with a target price even above $1,250 still in the cards (while the kind of swift breakout that might not happen without some external catalyst is not completely ruled out either).

Citing two sources within the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the expert outlined several possible outcomes for the Ripple vs SEC case. Notably, AP Abacus’ predictions drew skeptical responses and raised eyebrows from legal experts John Deaton, Bill Morgan, and Fred Rispoli. Let’s dive into the experts’ reactions and explore their implications for Ripple’s future. XRP Lawsuit Nears Endgame: Experts React Recently, Arch Public co-founder Andrew AP Abacus took to X to share insights on the imminent resolution of the prolonged XRP lawsuit. He stated, “*two* SEC sources believe Ripple case is very close to ending.” Significantly, the potential conclusion of the Ripple vs SEC case is a long-standing debate. AP Abacus’ recent post added fuel to the fire, generating both optimism and skepticism. While many community members remain optimistic, legal experts and XRP lawyers raise eyebrows. For instance, pro-XRP attorney John Deaton’s simple reaction gained attention as he posted a pair of eyes emoji, conveying his surprise and skepticism. Similarly, Bill Morgan, another prominent XRP lawyer, expressed mixed reactions to AP Abacus’ predictions. Bill Morgan raised concerns over certain aspects of the expert’s predictions, while also acknowledging some positive points. XRP Lawsuit: Possible Outcomes In his X post, AP Abacus provided a few possible outcomes for the XRP lawsuit as it nears its conclusion. According to him, the US SEC may consider classifying the XRP token as a commodity. This possible classification could have a significant implication over the regulatory status of XRP. UPDATE: *two* SEC sources believe @Ripple case is very close to ending. Some expected outcomes: • “expect $XRP to get serious commodity consideration.” • “greatly reduced fine; GREATLY reduced” • “new leadership knows this case and how they handle it is a big deal;… — Andrew (@AP_Abacus) March 17, 2025 In addition, AP Abacus stated that the Ripple may face a reduced fine in the XRP lawsuit. While the penalty imposed by Judge Analisa Torres is $125 million, a reduced fine could invoke a new turn in the Ripple vs SEC case. Interestingly, XRP advocacy platform All Things XRP had previously predicted a penalty reduction , assigning it a 30% probability. Further, the expert suggested that the US SEC’s new leadership recognizes the significance of this case and its potential to set a precedent for future regulatory decisions. This implies that the SEC may take a more cautious approach, ultimately benefitting Ripple. Ripple Case Outcome Sparks Mixed Reactions While John Deaton expressed his confusion with an emoji, XRP lawyer Bill Morgan shares a detailed opinion on AP Abacus’ Ripple lawsuit predictions. While Morgan remains hopeful about some points, including the XRP’s classification and the SEC’s cautious approach, he acknowledges a significant obstacle – the injunction- that needs to be addressed. Meanwhile, legal expert Fred Rispoli shared a lighthearted message with a mix of humor, sarcasm, and optimism. He admits that he’s selective in believing AP Abacus’ sources. He asserted that he would rather believe the positive updates while being skeptical of the negative. Rispoli attributes his selective skepticism to his “unbridled hope” for a favorable outcome, rather than hypocrisy. In other words, his optimism makes him receptive of positive news and more doubtful of negative outcomes. Previously, Rispoli had dismissed delay discussions on the XRP lawsuit resolution, asserting that a settlement is simple and possible.

Long-term holders keep accumulating it, and whale investors have also been making moves lately. Even with the substantial market ups and downs, transaction fees for Bitcoin have dropped to levels we haven’t seen since September 2024. In addition to that, those fees have also dropped at a time when we’re seeing more and more long-term holders of Bitcoin. Why is this significant? The shift in fee levels is definitely a positive sentiment shift. Total Bitcoin fees have once again decreased this week despite the significant market shifts, reaching levels not seen since Sept '24 pic.twitter.com/ZX28A9wRmS — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) March 14, 2025 Long-Term Holders Double Down on Bitcoin One of the most remarkable trends over the last month has been the ongoing accumulation of Bitcoin by long-term holders. In the preceding 30 days, these holders have added more than 131,000 BTC to their wallets. It is an expression of the confidence we are seeing from many investors who view Bitcoin as a long-term store of value. Long-term #Bitcoin holders have been on a buying spree, adding over 131,000 $BTC to their wallets in the past month! pic.twitter.com/7CWlWXX2uh — Ali (@ali_charts) March 13, 2025 Long-term holders are often considered the foundation of the Bitcoin ecosystem. These investors hold their Bitcoin for long durations and tend to keep it nearly inalterable for as long as they hold. They are a bit like the Shakers of the Bitcoin world. The not-so-secret secret about Shaking is that you do more of it when you are actually quite peaceful. The Shaking dance consists of fast movements that are almost frenzied. Meanwhile, many, many such movements are all part of partaking peacefully in the Shaking community. Even as the conditions of the market fluctuate, this accumulation comes at a time when the price of Bitcoin remains volatile. Yet these holders are undeterred. They are confident that the digital asset will continue to thrive. Accumulating Bitcoin in any kind of market is a bold statement of confidence. These investors are making that statement. Whales Make Their Presence Felt Besides the actions of long-term holders, another group is making a huge impact in the Bitcoin market. We are talking about whales—large Bitcoin investors. In the past 48 hours, these whales have purchased over 20,000 Bitcoin. That buying has added to the overall bullish sentiment that is coalescing among big players in the Bitcoin market. Due to their large amounts, whales can usually move the market when they want to. The buying of such a large amount of Bitcoin in such a short time span suggests that this investing group is positioning itself for some serious price appreciation in the near-to-medium future. With their resources and long-term vision, whales are strong market movers. Their recent buying of Bitcoin in seriously large chunks has the smell of optimism about it. The precise causes of the whale purchases remain unclear, but it’s evident that a large number of these investors see the present market situation as a chance to add significantly to their Bitcoin holdings ahead of what they foresee as the next substantial price upswing. Bitcoin Spot ETFs: Mixed Movements Reflect Changing Investor Sentiment Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) of Bitcoin have focused attention in the marketplace. Notable outflows of $143 million from Bitcoin spot ETFs on March 13 marked a substantial departure from the week-to-week inflows of recent memory. Those inflows had signaled a strengthening tide of interest from a new class of institutional investors. In contrast to their counterparts in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, ETFs of Bitcoin allow investors to capture the day-to-day price movements of the asset without having to buy the actual asset. Conversely, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, called IBIT, experienced a net inflow of $45.7 million during the same timeframe. This sharp contrast between the net outflow from other spot ETFs and the net inflow into BlackRock’s ETF underscores a not-so-clear distinction between investor preferences and decisions. On March 13, the total net outflow of Bitcoin spot ETF was 143 million US dollars, the net inflow of BlackRock ETF IBIT was 45.7467 million US dollars, and the total net outflow of Ethereum spot ETF was 73.6289 million US dollars. https://t.co/59u0BnEqLG — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 14, 2025 The more significant inflow into IBIT suggests that BlackRock’s ETF is viewed more favorably among investors who want exposed to Bitcoin but who prefer to invest in what they deem to be more structured and regulated products. The difference in ETF flows might show that institutional investors are becoming pickier in their Bitcoin investments. Some might have lowered their exposure, but others seem to have upped the ante on funds backed by well-known, well-respected financial firms. That might reflect a somewhat positive but cautious outlook on Bitcoin’s prospects. Decreasing Bitcoin Transaction Fees Amid Market Shifts Another important trend is the reduced costs of transacting in Bitcoin. Transaction fees have fallen to their lowest levels since September 2020. This may be indicating fewer transactions taking place or some other shift in the market’s operation. When fees drop, though, one clear and unambiguous message sent is that the network isn’t congested and shouldn’t be for the foreseeable future. That’s good news for anyone looking to transact and not incur costs that eat into the amount of Bitcoin received. Less congestion means transaction times should also be consistent. Lower fees could also make Bitcoin more appealing as a way to pay or send money across national borders. Of course, a slowdown in activity could lead to lower fees, and that is one way to read the current situation (beautifully summarized by Aaron Brown at Bloomberg). But with lower fees, users in all circumstances are better off. Conclusion: A Positive Outlook Despite Short-Term Fluctuations The latest happenings in the Bitcoin market—characterized by the steady accumulation of long-term holders, the active play of whales, mixed inflows and outflows from ETFs, and falling transaction fees—show that investors are still very much hopeful for Bitcoin’s future. Sure, it could always be said that the market is simply pricing in the potential of a future fully functioning Bitcoin network. And yet, a network only fully functions if enough people use it, right? And the thing I always come back to is that using Bitcoin always and everywhere is not yet quite a thing. And so what are the price signals really telling us? As the interest from institutions keeps increasing, especially through regulated products like Bitcoin ETFs, and as Bitcoin’s value as a store of value keeps resonating, the current trends seem to indicate a favorable future for the cryptocurrency. The coalescing whale activity, long-term holder accumulation, and seemingly favorable network conditions suggest that Bitcoin might very well keep proceeding on its current upward path, with these developments somehow looking set to drive it even higher in the months to come.

""I’ve been in the investment business for 35 years, and I can tell you that corrections are healthy, they are normal,” Bessent said Sunday on NBC’s Meet The Press, according to Bloomberg . “I‘m not worried about the markets. Over the long term, if we put good tax policy in place, deregulation and energy security, the markets will do great.” Bessent's comment contradicts popular belief that the Trump administration will quickly douse any fire stemming from the administration's policy moves, particularly trade tariffs. President Donald Trump also recently clarified his stance, saying he is not looking at the stock market. Wall Street's tech-heavy index, Nasdaq, and the S&P 500 entered correction last week, falling over 10% from their February highs predominantly on concerns that Trump's tariffs could slow economic growth while leading to sticky inflation. Bitcoin (BTC), too, has taken a beating, down nearly 25% from the record highs above $109K in January, according to CoinDesk Indices data , tracking the risk-off on Wall Street and digesting disappointment over the absence of fresh BTC purchases under Trump's strategic digital assets reserve plan. The risk-off has revved up expectations of policy support from the government or the Federal Reserve (Fed), particularly in the crypto community. However, Bessent's take suggests that it may take longer to manifest or require more significant market declines before any action is taken. The Treasury secretary said last month that the Trump administration is focused on lowering the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which influences most long-term loans in the economy. Meanwhile, Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues stressed early this month that they are watching to see the “net effects” of Trump's policies on the economy and are not in a hurry to cut rates.

From Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Gaming, to the ongoing evolution of meme coins, we’ve been seeing some pretty significant wallet activity that signals a newfound confidence in these sectors. So, which projects might be driving this recent influx of confidence? And what stories are gaining traction in the decentralized space? Top Accumulations in the Last 24 Hours The last day has seen a significant accumulation across various sectors, with AI and gaming leading the charge in our inquiries. There are four key categories where we see substantial wallet activity: 1. AI-driven projects 2. AI agents 3. Real-World Asset Tokenization (RWA) 4. MEMEs (not what you might expect in a bear market, but here we are!) AI and Gaming: A Growing Trend One of the most remarkable accumulations was seen in $GAI, the token behind @GAI_meme, which serves as the first launchpad for Gaming AI Agents on Base. This platform enables AI to generate custom games, a feature that has drawn significant attention from developers and investors alike. In the past 24 hours, six smart money wallets have accumulated a total of $15,000 worth of $GAI tokens, reflecting a market cap of $153K. This level of interest suggests that there’s a growing excitement about the intersection of gaming and artificial intelligence—that investors are positioning themselves early in a sector that seems ripe for future growth. The concept of AI in gaming isn’t novel, but projects like $GAI are taking it to the next level, creating possibilities beyond what we could have envisioned until now. An emphasis on AI-powered, user-generated content is what could push the gaming world to real-time personalization of all things core to the gaming experience. If $GAI isn’t quite doing that yet, it’s at least setting the stage for an era where that becomes standard. AI Agents: The Future of Automation Trailing not far behind is $AIXCB—a project spearheaded by @aixbt_project. This platform, centered on AI-driven projects, is now in the sights of smart money investors. Three separate smart money wallets have recently accumulated 20k worth of tokens, which bumps this project’s market cap to $6.2 million. As you can see, this is hardly a top project in the crypto market, but it is gaining attention—rightly so, in my opinion, because AI is the dominant theme in the crypto space right now and is a much-discussed area of research. The infusion of AI into the cryptocurrency network, especially with the creation of AI agents, has the chance to effect a paradigm shift. These autonomous agents can handle jobs, make decisions, and even interact with decentralized protocols, all without any human oversight. And that is exactly what has investors so interested in this development—because it has the potential to make decentralized networks vastly more efficient, scalable, and secure. Real-World Asset Tokenization: Bridging Traditional and Blockchain Finance Smart money is also pouring into Real World Asset (RWA) Tokenization, with $WHITE, the token for @WhiteRock_Fi, seeing a strong accumulation. This project aims to bridge the gap between traditional finance and blockchain by having a tokenization solution for real-world assets. One wallet that is obviously very smart has accumulated $9,500 worth of $WHITE tokens, and this project is now rocking a $586 million market cap. Smart money wallets accumulations in the last 24 hours Main specific narratives accumulated: AI and Gaming (10 wallets) AI Agents (6 wallets) Real-World Asset Tokenization (3 wallets) MEME (2 wallets) Top accumulations and reasoning: $GAI -> @GAI_meme is the… pic.twitter.com/nw3gOkk62n — CoinSense.app (@CoinSense_App) March 14, 2025 RWA tokenization is the next logical step in blockchain maturation. It’s a way to represent real-world assets, like real estate or commodities, on the blockchain. This sector’s development seems sure to catch the eyes of institutional investors and other big capital pools. Benefits it offers include increased liquidity, easier transfer of ownership, and the possibility of fractional ownership. MEME Coins: The Resilience of Popular Culture Certainly, the MEME segment continues to be a substantial market participant, with astute capital wagering on the enduring nature of established communities. $PEPE, a highly popular meme coin with a substantial number of followers, had one such wallet accumulate $9,600 worth of tokens. This brought its market cap to $3.04 billion. Despite the origins of its name, $PEPE has also made substantial cultural inroads in the space, attracting real and virtual retail investors as well as institutional ones. Meme coins have shown to be sturdy for the most part. This sturdiness can be attributed mainly to two features: the community aspect and the viral potential that these coins usually have. Take, for example, $PEPE. This token, in my opinion, is one of the best tokens that you can find in the meme coin space. This is because this token has not only a dedicated fanbase but also something that is becoming increasingly evident—mainstream awareness. The Big Picture: Smart Money Shows Confidence in Diversified Sectors The recent gathering of funds across these four sectors–AI and gaming, AI agents, RWA tokenization, and MEME–shows that smart-money investors aren’t just in it for a quick return. They’re seeing long-term value in projects that are innovating in important spaces, from artificial intelligence to the old-school finance world meeting up with blockchain. With the development of AI and gaming projects and the tokenization of RWAs, the very exciting, rapidly growing transformations we are witnessing in decentralized finance are equally set to take place in traditional finance. Meme coins, as we say, in a world of unpredictability offer a kind of reliable unpredictability now. In a world where we can’t really know what anything is worth, the sustained interest in both IRL and digital tokens makes us sure they’re worth something. That sustained interest seems like too much fun to think what we might be really paying in the future to hold our place in the fun house. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Interest in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is mounting across the crypto landscape as the third phase of its presale races for completion. And have secured $3.6 million from early backers and now have 5,800 token holders. the current price of $0.02 per MUTM for the project is attracting attention as a strategic entry point. Phase three is filling swiftly before its fourth stage, at which point prices will rise to $0.025 — a 25% jump for existing investors. Ethereum Approaches Key Resistance Levels Ethereum price action shows an ongoing battle between accumulation and profit taking. Exchange netflows — which can track ETH’s movements from wallets into exchanges and vice-versa — reveal investors withdrew 250,000 ETH in early 2025, indicating bullish sentiment similar to that of the accumulation phase during 2021. But the $1,850-$1,900 range is still a battleground, and $87.62 million in leveraged positions carries the risk of liquidation if volatility increases. ETH is currently priced at $1,894.11 and must overcome $1,985.53 for 64.54% of holders to be in profit. Falling below $1,800 could cause a cascade of sell-offs, testing support close to $1,700. Ripple Bounces on Macroeconomic Tailwinds XRP climbed 18% this week, to $2.24, as inflation data cooled, bolstering expectations of a pause in Federal Reserve rate hikes. The optimism is echoed in derivatives markets: open interest rose 3.48% to $3.05 billion while a long/short ratio of 2.49 from Binance proves stubbornly bullish positions remain dominant. A clear break above $2.50 would open targets at around $3, but overhanging resistance at $2.34 weighs on short-term expectations. Meanwhile, developments in Ripple’s court battle with the SEC — said to be close to a settlement — and Franklin Templeton’s XRP ETF application have added some fundamental heft. The Mutuum Finance Presale Momentum Builds As phase three approaches its funding cap, investor appetite has heated up for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . The tiered presale structure of the project guarantees for each phase progressively higher by having the first phase at $0.01, the second phase at $0.015, and the third at $0.02 before jumping 25% in phase four. Those early investors not only receive instant paper profits but a launch valuation of 200% — a ratio grounded in transparent tokenomics rather than speculative vapour. Once launched, MUTM’s $0.06 listing price will serve as a floor for returns, but the forecasts go even further. Demand could ascend toward $3.60 on platform adoption and its buy-and-distribute mechanism, which directs revenue to token buybacks. The utility of mtTokens’ yield-producing features and overcollateralized lending combined with this model gives MUTM dual-threat asset status: A presale asset with true DeFi legs. Emphasis on Security Excellence and Scalability The audit by an industry-leading blockchain security firm of Muutum Finance, indicates that investor concerns on smart contract risks have been duly attended to. As well its planned stablecoin — collateralized by a diversified basket of assets — aims to enhance ecosystem utility while hewing to the decentralist principles of DeFi. This layered approach to innovation sets MUTM apart from speculative assets driven by memes, as it enhances the mutual utility of the multi-asset mutual fund while addressing liquidity premiums and facilitating passive income generation. Timing Aligns With Opportunity While Ethereum and Ripple face headwinds specific to their respective markets, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is crystallizing its appeal in the crypto space with its structured growth and operational clarity. The ever-decreasing timeframe for purchasing MUTM at $0.02 highlights the need-to-know urgency: the swift pace of phase three fill rates could even foreshadow the extinction of early-stage opportunities. As phase four’s price increase looms and launch appreciation is secured, investors have a narrow window in which to seize this strategic entry.

Trump-Putin Ukraine Discussion Sparks Crypto Market Hope,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-putin-ukraine-peace-talks/,"Hold onto your hats, crypto enthusiasts! The ever-dynamic world of cryptocurrency is once again bracing for potential ripples from global events. This time, it’s not about Elon Musk’s tweets or regulatory crackdowns, but something far more significant: a potential shift in the geopolitical landscape. Former U.S. President Donald Trump has announced his intention to speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin on March 18 to discuss ending the ongoing war in Ukraine. Could this conversation be a turning point, and what does it mean for your crypto portfolio? Let’s dive into the details and explore the potential market impact . Why Trump-Putin Peace Talks Matter for Cryptocurrency While seemingly distant from the digital currency realm, geopolitical events have a profound and often immediate impact on financial markets, and cryptocurrency is no exception. The Russia-Ukraine conflict has already demonstrated this, contributing to market volatility and influencing investor sentiment. A discussion aimed at resolving this conflict, especially one involving figures as prominent as Trump and Putin, injects a new element of uncertainty – or perhaps, hope – into the global equation. Here’s why this news is relevant to you as a crypto holder: Geopolitical Risk and Market Volatility: Cryptocurrency, while often touted as a hedge against traditional market instability, is not immune to broader geopolitical risk . Events like wars, political tensions, and international crises can trigger significant market fluctuations. Any perceived escalation or de-escalation in global conflicts directly affects investor confidence and risk appetite, leading to shifts in asset allocation. Global Stability and Investor Sentiment: Global stability is a cornerstone of healthy financial markets. Prolonged conflicts erode investor confidence, leading to risk-off behavior. Conversely, any indication of progress towards peace can boost market optimism. A Trump-Putin discussion, even if just a conversation, is being interpreted by some as a potential step towards de-escalation, which could positively influence market sentiment. Safe Haven vs. Risk Asset: The role of cryptocurrency as a safe haven asset is constantly debated. In times of extreme uncertainty, some investors flock to assets perceived as safe havens. However, during periods of heightened geopolitical risk , crypto can also behave like a risk asset, experiencing sell-offs alongside stocks and other volatile markets. The outcome of these peace talks could sway crypto’s perception and behavior in the short to medium term. Economic Fallout and Inflation: The Ukraine war has had significant global economic consequences, including supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures. These factors directly influence monetary policy and investor decisions. Any progress towards peace could ease some of these pressures, potentially impacting inflation expectations and the broader economic outlook, which in turn affects cryptocurrency valuations. Decoding the Potential Market Impact of Trump-Putin Talks So, what kind of market impact can we anticipate from this Trump-Putin dialogue? Predicting market reactions with certainty is impossible, especially in the crypto space known for its volatility. However, we can consider a few potential scenarios: Scenario Potential Crypto Market Reaction Contributing Factors Optimistic Outcome (Perceived progress in peace talks) Positive – Potential price surge in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Increased investor confidence and risk appetite. Positive news headlines, reduced geopolitical tensions, increased inflow of funds into risk assets. Neutral Outcome (Talks happen, but no immediate breakthroughs) Mixed/Neutral – Market may remain volatile but largely unchanged in the short term. Focus shifts back to other market drivers like inflation data and regulatory news. Uncertainty persists, market awaits concrete actions, other economic factors regain prominence. Pessimistic Outcome (Talks fail or escalate tensions) Negative – Potential price drop across crypto markets. Increased risk aversion, flight to safety towards traditional assets or stablecoins. Negative news flow, heightened geopolitical tensions, increased market fear and uncertainty. It’s crucial to remember that the crypto market is influenced by a multitude of factors. While the Trump-Putin discussion is a significant event, its market impact will be intertwined with other ongoing narratives, such as inflation rates, interest rate hikes, regulatory developments, and technological advancements in the crypto space itself. Navigating Geopolitical Risk in Your Crypto Strategy How can you, as a crypto investor, navigate this period of geopolitical risk and potential market volatility? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on news related to the Ukraine war, the Trump-Putin discussion, and broader geopolitical developments. Reputable news sources and crypto market analysis platforms can provide valuable updates. Diversify Your Portfolio: Diversification is key in volatile times. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Consider diversifying across different cryptocurrencies and potentially allocating a portion of your portfolio to less volatile assets. Manage Risk: Understand your risk tolerance. Geopolitical events can trigger sharp market swings. Consider setting stop-loss orders or reducing your exposure if you are uncomfortable with high volatility. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that cryptocurrency is still a relatively young and evolving asset class. Short-term market fluctuations driven by geopolitical events are part of the journey. Maintain a long-term perspective and focus on the fundamental value and potential of your chosen crypto projects. Consider Stablecoins: In times of heightened uncertainty, stablecoins pegged to fiat currencies can offer a safe haven within the crypto ecosystem. They can be a useful tool to reduce volatility in your portfolio during turbulent periods. The Quest for Global Stability and its Crypto Connection The aspiration for global stability is not just a political ideal; it’s a fundamental prerequisite for sustained economic growth and healthy financial markets. The cryptocurrency market, while often seen as a disruptive force, is ultimately interconnected with the broader global economic and political landscape. Progress towards resolving conflicts like the war in Ukraine is a positive sign for overall global stability , and could create a more favorable environment for all asset classes, including cryptocurrency. The Trump-Putin discussion on March 18 is undoubtedly a noteworthy event. Whether it will lead to a significant breakthrough in the Ukraine conflict remains to be seen. However, its potential to influence market impact , investor sentiment, and the trajectory of the cryptocurrency market is undeniable. As crypto investors, staying informed, adapting to evolving geopolitical realities, and maintaining a balanced perspective are crucial in navigating these uncertain times.

41796586,https://nulltx.com/?p=147109,1742196703,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Smart Money Flow in Memecoin Market on March 13, 2025: Outflows Outpace Inflows",https://nulltx.com/smart-money-flow-in-memecoin-market-on-march-13-2025-outflows-outpace-inflows/,"Investor sentiment in the memecoin market shifted on March 13, 2025, as the smart money showed a net outflow of capital. This cautious approach of our major investors was further indicated by the inflows into only a few select memecoins. The overall trend here was definitely an outflow, which pointed towards an increasing appetite for something else outside of the memecoin space. Was it a movement back into Bitcoin? Was it major investors looking to route capital around into phase 2 of the next bull run? Whatever the reason, the nominal shift definitely took some wind out of the sails of the memecoin market. A Detailed Look at the Flow of Funds The memecoin market saw a total trading volume of $3.75 million on March 13, 2025, but this market experienced a very substantial net outflow of $1.8 million. And what was driving this outflow? Well, there was an outflow of $2.8 million and an inflow of just $958.1K. These figures suggest that the overall inclination of investors around that time was decidedly toward selling or trimming the memecoins they were holding. Although the overall trend is negative, some memecoins did see significant inflows, indicating that parts of the market are still attractive to investors. The memecoins attracting the most attention included $UFD, $SNAI, $PWEASE, #GRIFFAIN, and $BMT. Each of these tokens saw inflows in the range of $30,000 to $63,000, which suggests that some investors are making bets that these particular assets are either long-term plays or short-term trading opportunities. Memecoins Seeing Inflows: Speculative Moves and Hopes for Quick Returns The inflows were focused predominantly on just a few of the tokens that seem to have galvanized the memecoin community. For instance, $UFD saw inflows of $39.1K, while $SNAI was not far behind with $30.2K. Another clear standout was $PWEASE, the popular memecoin associated with U.S. Vice President JD Vance, which attracted a notable $63.3K in inflows—clearly riding the wave of a recent price uptick. Overall, the pretty clear takeaway here is that inflows are coming to the market and, at least for now, seem largely to be pumping up a handful of tokens that have found favor among the memecoin community. Recap:Smart money on chain activities in the memecoin market for 13/03/25 Yesterday, there was more outflow than inflow Inflow: $958.1k Outflow: $2.8M Volume: $3.75M Net Volume: -$1.8M There was inflow into: $UFD ($39.1K) $SNAI ($30.2K) $PWEASE ($63.3K) #GRIFFAIN ($50.9K)… pic.twitter.com/x8nUxUEsLk — Stalkchain (@StalkHQ) March 14, 2025 #GRIFFAIN and $BMT also saw some inflows, with $50.9K and $48.2K entering their respective markets. These tokens, while not as widely recognized as others in the memecoin space, appear to be gaining some attention from smart money, likely due to either their novelty or the speculative opportunities they present in the current market environment. This suggests that a subset of investors is willing to bet on the success of lesser-known memecoins in the hopes of achieving quick profits. Memecoins Seeing Outflows: Caution and Profit-Taking In contrast, there were many larger, more established memecoins that saw significant outflows. The largest outflow was associated with $FARTCOIN, which lost $1.4 million, indicating that investors were taking profits or battening down the hatches in anticipation of a possible market downturn. Other tokens that experienced net outflows included $ARC, with $227.3K bailing, and $FAT, which saw $57.9K leave its coffers. In the meantime, the infamous memecoins GIGA and WBTC had outflows too, but theirs was the smallest of the bunch at $53.8K and $187.4K. Still, these outflows from even more prominent memecoins suggest a more risk-averse attitude among investors, who might be worried about the sustainability of current price levels. The Bigger Picture: A Market in Flux The ner… and volatility; smart money flows are pointing to a more cautious outlook. Some tokens are still seeing investment, but the overall trend is toward outflows—indicating that some investors are either taking profits or pulling back on risk exposure. That is the kind of behavior you expect from a speculative market highly sensitive to short-term price movements. Over the next few weeks, we can expect the memecoin sector’s individual tokens to largely track overall market sentiment. If you think the meme token economy might be heading for a tropical paradise of community engagement and ongoing project hype, it’s still far from a certainty. Cryptos in the memecoin sector are well-known for their volatility. Even tokens that seem to be riding the meme wave well aren’t safe from sharp market corrections. As we progress further into 2025, it will be intriguing to observe whether this outflow trend persists or the market swings back to a more optimistic outlook, with cash again flowing into the memecoin domain. For the moment, the prevailing sentiment among investors who are almost surely of the “smart money” variety seems to favor sitting on the sidelines, with these individuals taking a “wait and see” stance on how the market develops in the near future.

41796700,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=140620,1742196783,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Groundbreaking South Korea Crypto Bill: Unleashing Corporate Investment in Bitcoin and Ethereum,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/south-korea-corporate-crypto-bill/,"Get ready for a potential game-changer in the crypto world! South Korea, a nation known for its tech-forward approach and vibrant cryptocurrency market, is taking a monumental step towards mainstream crypto adoption. A new bill has been introduced by the ruling People Power Party (PPP) that could dramatically alter the landscape of corporate crypto investment in the country. What does this mean for the future of digital assets in South Korea and beyond? Let’s dive into the details of this exciting development. What’s the Buzz About the South Korea Crypto Bill? For the first time in South Korea’s 22nd National Assembly, which commenced on May 30, 2024, a bill has been put forward to officially permit corporate crypto investment . This landmark legislation, championed by Jung Sung-kook of the ruling People Power Party (PPP), aims to amend the Financial Investment Services and Capital Markets Act. The core of the amendment lies in reclassifying virtual assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) as legitimate ‘properties’ that asset management companies can invest in. This might sound like a technicality, but it’s a HUGE leap forward. Why is this reclassification so significant? Opening Doors to Institutional Money: By recognizing cryptocurrencies as investable properties, the bill paves the way for institutional investors and corporations to allocate funds into the crypto market through regulated channels. Facilitating Crypto ETFs: Perhaps the most anticipated outcome is the potential for spot crypto ETFs . Currently, South Korea, like many other regions, has been hesitant about approving spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. This bill directly addresses this by making it legally feasible for asset managers to include these digital assets in ETF products. Boosting Market Confidence: Legal clarity and institutional participation often lead to increased market confidence. This move could signal to both domestic and international investors that South Korea is serious about embracing the future of finance. Unpacking Corporate Crypto Investment: Benefits and Challenges The prospect of allowing corporate crypto investment in South Korea brings with it a wave of potential benefits, but also some challenges that need careful consideration. Potential Benefits: Increased Liquidity and Market Depth: Corporate investment can inject significant capital into the crypto market, leading to higher liquidity and making it easier for traders to execute large orders without causing drastic price swings. Mainstream Adoption: When corporations start investing in cryptocurrencies, it sends a powerful signal of legitimacy to the broader public. This can accelerate mainstream adoption and integration of digital assets into the financial system. Innovation and Growth in the Crypto Ecosystem: Increased capital flow can fuel innovation within the crypto space. Companies may be more inclined to develop new products and services around cryptocurrencies, fostering growth and expansion of the ecosystem. Portfolio Diversification for Corporations: Cryptocurrencies, with their low correlation to traditional assets, can offer corporations a valuable tool for portfolio diversification, potentially enhancing returns and managing risk. Potential Challenges: Regulatory Oversight and Compliance: As corporate crypto investment grows, robust regulatory frameworks are essential to protect investors and prevent illicit activities. Ensuring compliance with evolving regulations can be complex for businesses. Volatility and Risk Management: The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility. Corporations venturing into this space need to have robust risk management strategies in place to navigate price fluctuations and potential market downturns. Custody and Security Concerns: Safely storing and managing large amounts of cryptocurrency assets is a critical challenge for corporations. Secure custody solutions and robust security protocols are paramount to prevent theft and loss. Accounting and Tax Implications: The accounting and tax treatment of cryptocurrencies are still evolving in many jurisdictions. Corporations need clear guidelines and expertise to handle the financial reporting and tax obligations associated with crypto investments. Crypto ETFs: The Gateway to Broader Investment? The proposed bill is particularly exciting because of its potential to unlock crypto ETFs in South Korea. Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are investment vehicles that track the price of an underlying asset or index and are traded on stock exchanges. They offer a convenient and regulated way for investors to gain exposure to an asset class without directly owning the asset itself. Why are Crypto ETFs so sought after? Feature Spot Crypto ETFs Traditional Crypto Investment Accessibility Easily accessible through brokerage accounts, familiar to traditional investors. Requires setting up crypto exchange accounts and managing wallets, can be complex for newcomers. Regulation & Security Operates within established regulatory frameworks, offering investor protection. Regulation varies, security risks associated with self-custody and exchange vulnerabilities. Liquidity High liquidity due to exchange trading, easy to buy and sell. Liquidity can vary depending on the cryptocurrency and exchange. Tax Efficiency (Potentially) Tax treatment may be similar to traditional ETFs in some jurisdictions. Tax implications can be more complex and vary depending on the type of crypto transaction. If South Korea approves crypto ETFs , it could significantly broaden access to crypto investments for both retail and institutional investors. It would also align South Korea with other jurisdictions that are increasingly exploring and approving crypto ETFs, potentially boosting its competitiveness in the global digital asset market. Bitcoin Investment and Ethereum Investment: Leading the Charge The bill specifically mentions Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) as virtual assets eligible for corporate investment, recognizing their status as the two largest and most established cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. This focus on Bitcoin investment and Ethereum investment is strategic for several reasons: Market Dominance and Maturity: Bitcoin and Ethereum have demonstrated greater market resilience and maturity compared to many other cryptocurrencies. Their established track records make them more palatable for institutional investors seeking relatively lower-risk crypto exposure. Institutional Demand: There is significant pent-up institutional demand for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Many corporations and asset managers have expressed interest in allocating a portion of their portfolios to these digital assets, and this bill could provide the regulatory green light they’ve been waiting for. Foundation for a Broader Crypto Market: Starting with Bitcoin and Ethereum can serve as a solid foundation for gradually expanding corporate investment to other cryptocurrencies in the future, as the market matures and regulatory clarity improves. The potential influx of Bitcoin investment and Ethereum investment from corporations in South Korea could have a substantial positive impact on the prices and overall market sentiment for these leading cryptocurrencies. What’s Next? The introduction of this bill is a significant first step. It will now go through the legislative process, including committee reviews and votes in the National Assembly. While the bill is spearheaded by the ruling party, it will be crucial to watch for cross-party support and any potential amendments as it progresses. For crypto enthusiasts and investors, this development is undoubtedly exciting. It signals a potential shift in South Korea’s stance towards cryptocurrency regulation and could position the nation as a key player in the global digital asset landscape.

There is now an active ‘man-hunt’ to stop the perpetrator in its tracks. According to data on Hypurrscan, on Mar. 17 at 6:30 AM UTC, the whale just closed two positions through Time-Weighted Average Price or TWAP for a combined 208 BTC ( BTC ) at a price of $83,392. The total worth of both transactions is equal to more than $18 million. At 4:30 AM UTC, the anonymous trader added $7.5 million in collateral to their Bitcoin short position to avoid being liquidated by the margin on Hyperliquid. On-chain data shows that the trader has accumulated a loss of nearly $1.1 million from unrealized profit and loss or PNL. This whale still managed to turn a profit despite being hunted by a team! 11 hours ago, @Cbb0fe publicly formed a team to hunt this whale who shorted $BTC with 40x leverage. Just one hour later, the team was in action, driving $BTC above $84,690 in a short period. The whale… pic.twitter.com/D6FBOFikZR — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) March 17, 2025 At the moment, the trader’s current position stands at 5,167 BTC, with a value of around $429 million. The short position stands at 40x leverage and has an unrealized profit of $4 million. Simultaneously the trader also has a long position with 5x leverage for 571,715 MELANIA ( MELANIA ) valued at $390,000.

At the time, a crypto trader on X with the username @Cbb0fe or CBB detected the whale’s suspicious activity and called for other traders to join a public manhunt to liquidate the whale’s position before it could cause more harm to the ecosystem. “If you are willing to hunt this dude with size, drop a DM, setting up a team right now and already got good size,” said CBB on their post . In a separate post, CBB told traders to message them with “7 figs size only” as the combined funds of the team had already exceeded eight figures. An hour after the team was formed, they managed to drive up the market price of Bitcoin from $83,183 to more than $84,690. As a result, the whale was forced to deposit $5 million in USDC ( USDC ) to increase its margin and avoid liquidation. However, the manhunt has yet to success as the whale continues to evade liquidation by boosting its position to short BTC through TWAP. Hyperliquid’s official account also recently commented on the viral bear trader’s activity on-chain, describing how the protocol has become synonymous with “the market” as it has garnered significant attention from the crypto community. “When a whale shorts $450M+ BTC and wants a public audience, it’s only possible on Hyperliquid,” wrote the account. Earlier this month, on March 12, a whale began a long position on Hyperliquid with 50x leverage for 175,000 ETH ( ETH ) worth $340 million. Due to the large liquidation amount, Hyperliquid was forced to absorb the position at $1,915 in an effort to liquidate it. As a result, Hyperliquid lost more than $4 million.

Not long ago, $GOAT was riding high, crossing the $1 billion market cap, and looked to many like a serious contender for the pantheon of promising investments. Capturing the imagination of traders and investors alike, the token seemed like a one-way bet to the top. But in the space of about one month, it saw a staggering decline that set it tumbling to a mere $56.4 million market cap. What in the world happened? What catastrophic flip of the switch brought about this most talkative token’s talkative demise? Will it even be remembered as a token, or will it only be remembered as a symbol of the unpredictable nature of the digital asset market? Bottom line: Can we hedge against the risk of holding tokens for the long term? The Rise: A Token on the Verge of Greatness At its peak, $GOAT was among the rare tokens on the Pumfun exchange that had successfully crossed the $1 billion mark for market capitalization. It had all the elements for success: a name you couldn’t forget, a link to cutting-edge AI technology, and the sheer excitement that propels crypto prices to new records. If anything, $GOAT’s status as a “memecoin” only enhanced its profile. The token raked in huge amounts of attention from investors rushing to assemble portfolios of AI-driven assets. The coin stirred excitement from the outset. For a long time, it looked as if it were an inevitable upward path, with the crypto recovering from downward corrections to soaring heights that seemed more guaranteed with each passing day. The $GOAT token was no exception. Its Friday high price looked more than likely to realize another weekend run not seen in this space for months. And with the promise of an NFT drop possibly today, the topaz coin that works with the Ethereum smart contract seemingly found a historical moment for propelling itself to even further heights. The Fall: A Sudden and Harsh Decline Yet again, we see that in the crypto world, there are no extended good times. Suddenly and harshly, $GOAT has begun to move in the opposite direction, and its current value is a shadow of what it once was. Today, we find it at a market cap of just $56.4 million, after a drop that has left just about no one touched with a warm, fuzzy feeling. $GOAT once a shining star among AI tokens One of the few coins on Pumfun to cross the $1B marketcap is now a shadow of its former self. Goat is now at $56.4M and has lost about 95.65% of its value. Holders count is presently at 88,394 and sol liquidity is worth $1.27M meaning… pic.twitter.com/ufvCz3crup — Stalkchain (@StalkHQ) March 14, 2025 That’s a heart-stopping, gut-wrenching drop of 95.65% since the only time it was ever worth more. $GOAT didn’t go down quickly but rather fell, and that falling is a wake-up call for folks in the crypto world. Goats don’t stay on top for long. They climb high and then come down fast. Whatever $GOAT’s actual price is (or was), it appeared to some (and surely to many $GOAT holders) that the price reflected a rocket on the rise. Then it looked like a mountain when it was really just a hill. When it went over the top, then it came down and down and down to where we are now. And what are we now? We are not on top of the GOAT. The GOAT is falling.Maconline.com keeps saying so. When the GOAT’s falling, crypto’s going with it. And when is crypto not going with it? That’s another question. One critical factor behind the collapse of $GOAT is its dwindling liquidity. With only $1.27 million in liquidity and 88,394 holders, the marketplace for $GOAT is extremely shallow. That limited liquidity makes it hard for investors to sell their stakes without meaningfully moving the price—and when that happens, it really does feel like the thing is collapsing, and it starts to look like there’s not much in the way of support, which of course invites more selling. A Lesson Learned: Trading vs. Holding Long-Term Key lessons messaged by the demise of $GOAT: Crypto trading can be more profitable than HODLing (holding long term). This is especially true for tokens that lack strong fundamentals. In the space of crypto KOLs (key opinion leaders), there’s mostly a vibe of profiting on the short-term ups and downs of the market. Holding tends to be viewed as a short way of saying “dumb strategies.” And trading, of course, isn’t risk-free. Although it can be a rewarding strategy for some, holding has significant risks. Tokens such as $GOAT, which have none of the fundamental strength that a development team, a set of solid partnerships, or a useful presence in the real world might provide, are particularly vulnerable to the kinds of wild and unsustainable price swings that we saw in the last bull run and that some of us might hope never to see again. Given those price swings and the missed opportunities they represent, you might wonder why anyone would even think about holding for the long term. It is most important to evaluate the fundamentals behind any project if you are an asset holder. Look closely at these elements: – Use case: Does the project have strong, demonstrated use cases? – Team: Is the project team credible? – Partnerships: Are there partnerships in place that could drive significant value, or at least some value, to this project? It’s clear that determining the answers to these questions is essential if you want to stand a chance of picking a cryptocurrency that will exist, in any form, five years from now. To summarize, the collapse of $GOAT reminds us of the risks we take in the cryptocurrency market. When you invest in crypto, you have the chance to see huge profits, but there’s also a real possibility that you’ll lose it all. If you’re going to play in this space, first understand that the trends we see often don’t last long. Second, have confidence in either what you’re trading or what you’re holding for the long term—because in crypto, nothing is guaranteed. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

41796999,https://nulltx.com/?p=147148,1742197204,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Beosin Reveals Suspicious Price Manipulation of $SHELL Token by Market Makers,https://nulltx.com/beosin-reveals-suspicious-price-manipulation-of-shell-token-by-market-makers/,"A comprehensive on-chain analysis carried out by Beosin, a prominent blockchain security and auditing firm, has shed light on a number of dubious dealings afoot in the world of the $SHELL token. Beosin’s sleuthing has revealed what could well be potential price manipulation schemes, and they’ve connected the dots to market makers and certain addresses that seem to be linked to @myshell_ai. What’s more, Beosin Trace says these transactions were intimately tied to some very significant price swings experienced by the $SHELL token itself. The series of large transfers of $SHELL tokens between different addresses are analyzed here. Multiple transfers to hot wallets associated with major crypto exchanges are numerous. Most of those transfers and many of the occurrences seem to be part of a coordinated effort to attack the price of the token before it is listed. This heist raises some serious questions about the market conditions leading up to the listing. The Suspicious Transactions Behind $SHELL’s Price Surge One of Beosin’s most alarming findings is that more than $1 million worth of $SHELL tokens was transferred just minutes before the token was listed on Binance Spot. Beosin’s Trace report states that at 19:08:19 on February 27, 2025 (UTC+8), Address 2, linked to @myshell_ai, sent 1,538,462 $SHELL tokens to a user at a Binance address, valued at around $1 million. This transfer happened some 112 minutes before the token’s official listing on Binance Spot, and it smells a lot like a last-minute pump before the token started trading. This suspicious transfer was not an isolated event. Between 20:19 and 20:40 (UTC+8) on the same day, Address 3 (0xf60b) and a Bitget hot wallet executed a series of transfers, moving a total of 5,829,159.2 $SHELL tokens—worth around $3.5 million—to another Binance user address. The timing and magnitude of these transactions raise concerns about the role of market makers in potentially orchestrating these moves to drive up the token’s price before its exchange debut. A Web of Transactions Linked to Major Exchanges The transactions under suspicion were not restricted to just a single day. They spanned multiple days and involved numerous complex components. On February 14, 2025, the Safe Wallet identified with @myshell_ai (0x45ca) made a transfer of 500,000 $SHELL tokens to a Bitget user address (0x31034fb4a5212994f1540ab7067f721f152421ac). This transfer was in two parts: 500,000 $SHELL tokens (Ethereum) and the same amount (500,000 $SHELL tokens), but this time, in the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) version. Now, the next day, on February 13, 2025, we find Address 3 (0xf60b) involved in different parts of a similar scheme: on this occasion, moving and then retransferring $SHELL tokens to and from various wallets such that, in the end, it appears that another 500,000 $SHELL tokens (again, both the Ethereum and BSC versions) were moved to nearly the same Bitget user address as in the earlier transaction. Moreover, Address 3 (0xf60b) sent an incredible 5 million $SHELL tokens to 0xc606, which, in turn, transferred 2.5 million of those tokens to 0x89fe. Then, on March 11, 0x89fe deposited 612,913.95 $SHELL tokens into another Bitget user address, 0xf8706f1e4c4502b7cc5eb1b6140f6de5324e2bd4. These trades done by different addresses controlled by the same user, done right before $SHELL is listed on exchanges, make a very compelling case that these market makers were the ones that moved the price up before exchanges listed $SHELL. 1/ Beosin has released an insightful on-chain analysis of $Shell to reveal suspicious token price manipulation by market makers. Here is an easy-to-understand thread of it pic.twitter.com/49QF9vAxMn — Beosin Web3 Security & Compliance (@Beosin_com) March 15, 2025 Implications for the $SHELL Token and the Broader Crypto Market Beosin’s analysis of $SHELL’s price manipulation spotlights a potentially troubling trend of market manipulation using coordinated token transfers. The actions uncovered in the report demonstrate how market makers can use their control over token movements and access to large exchanges to pump up the price of a token before its public listing. The exposure of these dubious activities could injure the $SHELL token’s reputation and trust in the market. Even let us say that it had a beautiful rise in value following its initial exchange listings. The overall market is so jittery right now that any hint of negative news can lead to a price drop, let alone a surge in apparent token value that is based on good ol’ fashioned manipulation. This incident additionally provokes wider worries about how vulnerable the crypto space is to market manipulation. As cryptocurrencies increasingly become part of the global financial system, the necessity for regulatory oversight and, even more so, transparency in token listings is becoming more evident. This is especially true for tokens that are associated with larger blockchain projects, where any kind of market manipulation that happens can have a larger overall effect on the crypto space. The Role of Blockchain Auditing Firms in Enhancing Market Integrity To counteract the increasing dangers associated with token manipulation, blockchain security companies, such as Beosin, are vital for the fortification of market integrity. Thanks to their careful, on-chain investigations, they are able to pinpoint not just dubious behaviors but also potential weaknesses that exist within the market itself. Thus, they are a big part of making the greater crypto ecosystem a safer space for all involved. The crypto market is growing up and finding its place in the financial world. As it matures, it’s likely to attract the same level of scrutiny that traditional financial markets do—especially when it comes to possibly illegal activities like market manipulation. This week, the crypto forensic firm Beosin published a report about just how much manipulation (in terms of deceiving honest investors) still goes on in the crypto space, even as this supposedly largely lawless sector has been cleaned up a bit since last year. Beosin’s report is a good reminder that anything on a blockchain is not necessarily always above board. To sum up, Beosin’s recent on-chain analysis shines a light on possibly illegal or unethical goings-on with the $SHELL token’s price. The analysis, part of Beosin’s ongoing coverage of intriguing tokens, underlines the importance of knowing what’s really going on with a token before, say, buying it or putting it in a DeFi protocol. Indeed, the investigation found that the people buying the $SHELL token weren’t really buying something that was worth what they were paying. And some of those people might have been using the $SHELL token to pay for something other than the right to buy that token. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

It was said that XRP could be used for state-level financial transactions and optimizing government payments, ADA for academic credentialing, smart contracts for government services, and secure infrastructure, and SOL for high-speed blockchain applications like secure voting and digital identity management. However, these rumors were quickly shot down by the founder of CryptoLaw and pro-XRP lawyer, who clarified on social media that the SEC had not released any such information.

The order sparked interest in the market, as Trump named Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, Solana, and Cardano as the digital assets expected to be included in the reserve. However, the market was left disappointed after the announcement, as many were hoping for a concrete plan to buy new tokens. On March 7, President Donald Trump hosted a meeting with crypto executives at the White House for the first-ever Crypto Summit. During the summit, Trump and other cabinet officials met with key figures from the crypto industry to show continued support for the sector and gather ideas for future regulation and legislation. This event followed Trump’s recent Executive Order, which announced the creation of a federal Bitcoin reserve. However, when Trump first mentioned the idea earlier, there were concerns that he might raise taxes to buy crypto and that including smaller, more volatile coins like Cardano and XRP could pose risks.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,XRP|REGULATION|ADA|FIAT|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-17 07:41:40

We now stand at the threshold of an era where AI and blockchain technology can work together to create a buying and selling experience that is intuitive, safe, and efficient. Streamlining Luxury Car Transactions with AI and Blockchain At the cusp of entwining the blockchain technology with the luxury vehicle market is CryptoAutos, which now offers the ability to make purchases and sales of high-end cars using digital currencies like $PAAL. The partnership with PAAL AI, on the other hand, could take this company to the next level and edify the user experience with artificial intelligence (AI). CryptoAutos could become even more personalized, with AI helping to make the car-buying process not only more efficient but, one might hope, enjoyable as well. One of the key features enabled by the PAAL AI integration is the AI-powered customer assistance, which provides users with real-time support during the car-buying journey. Whether it’s answering questions, guiding users through the payment process, or offering tailored recommendations, the AI-driven assistance ensures that customers receive a seamless and hassle-free experience. Proud to collaborate w/ @CryptoAutos_ Integrating $PAAL payments into their cutting-edge platform! Get behind the wheel of luxury cars with $PAAL today. Crypto Autos is an innovative project that combines the world of cryptocurrency with the automotive industry, aiming to… https://t.co/DSYCJEgAQ0 — PAAL AI (@PaalMind) March 12, 2025 Furthermore, the automated luxury car recommendations function uses advanced algorithms to analyze user preferences and suggest vehicles that align with their specific tastes and needs. This ensures that buyers can find their ideal car with minimal effort. Yet another fascinating aspect of the PAAL AI integration is the custom Telegram bot built exclusively for the CryptoAutos community. Telegram is one of the most popular messaging platforms among cryptocurrency’s many fans and businesses, and the CryptoAutos bot will be a crucial interface for engaging with our platform. Be it for customer support, user transactions, or simply engaging with the latest platform developments—such as our recent on-platform rebranding—the bot will be an unobtrusive and seamless way for our users to buy and sell in the decentralized marketplace. A New Chapter for AI, Web3, and Real-World Assets The collaboration of PAAL AI and CryptoAutos marks a big step in combining AI, Web3, and real-world assets. As the blockchain and cryptocurrency businesses push into new sectors, they appear unable to stop invading the old marketplace. Using digital tools, they claim to be revolutionizing the traditional sector, which is 4.0. In this revolution’s name, they promise to transform everything. In this partnership, PAAL AI and CryptoAutos appear to be delivering a new luxury vehicle transaction experience. In this integrated system, users can expect scope, services tailored to their individual needs, and heightened security when conducting significant business, like trading in exotic automobiles. Paying with $PAAL tokens—and, for that matter, with any number of traditional currency options—means that luxury car deals are now not only but also. For PAAL AI, this integration marks yet another step forward in establishing its place as a dominant force in the AI-driven blockchain space. The company has already made a splash with its innovative ecosystem, which lets users create customized AI bots that can be deployed across several different platforms. By reaching out into the automotive sector, PAAL AI shows how its technology can be applied to all kinds of complex problems in all sorts of industries it hasn’t yet touched. The Future of Luxury Car Sales in the Web3 Era The partnership between PAAL AI and CryptoAutos spotlights a nexus where Web3 and AI meet—one that revolves around the traditional, often arcane, world of high-end automotive sales. These are events where huge sums of money change hands; where the demands of vanity, ego, and simple overindulgence mix; where concerns about security and privacy are all the greater for the absence of any mechanisms that enforce either. So is your luxury vehicle sale happening on a blockchain? If not, why not? In the not-too-distant future, this union may very well serve as a model for other industries that are trying to figure out how to harness the still-emerging AI and blockchain technologies. Meanwhile, as large segments of the global economy continue their transformation into a digital one, the luxury carmakers are very much in the vanguard of benefiting from this wave of new tech. And of all the recent technological developments, the auto industry stands to gain the most in implementing AI to personalize the car-buying experience and the use of blockchain technology to streamline the experience. To sum up, the conjunction of PAAL AI with CryptoAutos marks a major event in the sphere of luxury vehicle transactions. It is the world of next-generation AI where this new partnership, founded on the principles of blockchain technology, lives and breathes. With these key innovations very much in mind, we take a look at this new strategic alliance and the seamless platform it offers to users for executing digital transactions of high-end vehicles.

41797155,https://nulltx.com/?p=147146,1742197484,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Is Coinbase’s Recent Dip the Right Time to Buy?,https://nulltx.com/is-coinbases-recent-dip-the-right-time-to-buy/,"The leading U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase (COIN), has seen its stock plunge nearly 50% from its all-time highs. Many investors are asking whether this is the right time to buy or if the company’s future is less certain than it once seemed. Despite the significant drop in price, the fundamentals behind Coinbase remain as strong as ever. The company continues to grow its product offerings, secure regulatory victories, and see increasing adoption by institutional investors. When we dissect the main influences on Coinbase’s performance, we find that the current downturn is likely not a direct outcome of any decisions made by the company, but more of a market reaction to some broader driving factors. In this piece, we’ll explore the motivations behind the recent sell-off, assess how well we think Coinbase is positioned for growth in the future, and then try to determine if this current dip is a valid buying opportunity. Why the Sell-Off? Coinbase’s share price has dropped sharply, but a closer look shows that it is not just Coinbase, but also Bitcoin that has seen dramatic drops. As Coinbase states, “Bitcoin (BTC) has fallen approximately 30% from its highs.” And from my close watch over the years, I would have to say that on a not quite constant but definitely close to a 1:1 ratio, when Bitcoin drops, not just Coinbase, but the whole cryptocurrency market suffers and Coinbase’s price drops as well. $COIN is down nearly 50% from its highs, but the fundamentals have never looked stronger. SEC case dropped. Institutional adoption rising. A growing crypto product suite. Is this the dip to buy? Let’s break it down. pic.twitter.com/aADywSc4iG — Nansen (@nansen_ai) March 14, 2025 Moreover, the revenue that Coinbase receives from crypto trading is exceedingly responsive to the market’s condition. Trading volumes are down across the board. As a result, Q1 revenue is expected to be 14% lower than the previous quarter. This drop in earnings coincides with a broader adverse market sentiment, and it’s undoubtedly also contributing to our downward trajectory in price. However, we aren’t pessimistic about this short-term weakness necessarily indicating something long-term unfavorable. After all, in the Coinbase crypto trajectory, the context is one of growth, not decline, and the regulatory backdrop is increasingly favorable. A Positive Regulatory Shift for Coinbase The recent regulatory victory with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is one of the most substantial factors impacting the long-term outlook for Coinbase. After extended periods of murkiness and legal hurdles, the SEC has abandoned its case against Coinbase. This unfurling of events has paved the way for the exchange to start listing more tokens and to expand its offerings quite significantly. The removal of this precipitative cloud associated with a very significant part of the weather regulator section of the report seems pretty important. It seems to be a turning point. In addition, Coinbase is no longer simply responding to the regulatory environment; it is actively shaping U.S. crypto policy. With a U.S. administration in place that is pro-crypto, the environment for centralized exchanges (CEXs) like Coinbase is improving. As the company works more closely with regulators and policymakers, it could emerge as a key player in establishing clearer, more supportive regulations for the whole crypto industry. That strategic shift appears to position Coinbase for continued growth as the regulatory landscape becomes more favorable. Strong Fundamentals and Future Growth Potential Even with the crypto markets experiencing short-term volatility, Coinbase’s fundamentals remain impressive. The company has margins that would make many tech stocks envious, with operating margins that hover around 40%. That number, of course, is pre-tax, and the taxes Coinbase would pay if it were not based in San Francisco would probably lower its margins. All that said, 40% is an incredibly high operating margin and a sign that Coinbase is doing something right. Nonetheless, it is important to point out that around 60% of Coinbase’s earnings still arrive courtesy of cryptocurrency trading. That kind of sustained burn means dealing with a highly unstable crypto market, where low trading volumes in a bad quarter can be pretty much offset by higher trading volumes when the next bad quarter rolls around. Conversely, if good quarters become the new normal, then Coinbase has upside in terms of not just trading volumes but also increased revenues through what might be called its new normal windfall. Considering crypto trading, Coinbase isn’t merely an exchange to trade in digital currencies. It is broadening its product offerings, and by doing so is very much a player in the emerging industry of tokenized assets. From what they tell us, the audience for these products ranges from retail and individual investors to institutional players, with the latter being a much bigger audience than anyone thought possible just a few years ago. Is Now the Right Time to Buy? Because the market is undervaluing Coinbase’s long-term growth potential in the face of some short-term volatility, the current price could be a very attractive entry point for investors who are willing to risk a bet. Coinbase is leading in the adoption of cryptocurrencies by both retail and institutional investors. As the cryptocurrency market matures, Coinbase’s place among core, financial-platform providers for digital assets becomes clearer. Although every investment carries some danger, and especially in the volatile world of cryptocurrency, the recent dip in Coinbase’s stock price could give a false impression of the company’s overall health. The following three factors indicate that not only is Coinbase likely to make it through the current turbulence, it’s also in a prime position to come out stronger on the other side than it was before. To conclude, Coinbase’s fundamentals look better than ever, and the company’s recent win with regulators and its push for much wider adoption of crypto signal a bright future to us.

The investor sentiment has improved as the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) records a massive surge in the meme coin activity led by Mubarak. As a result, the DEX volumes on BSC has reached a record high surpassing Solana. BNB Price Jumps 4.5% Eyes Fresh All time Highs Following the current development, the BNB price has shot up by 4.5% today while the broader crypto market is facing consolidation.At press time, BNB was trading at $628 with daily trading volume surging 21% to $1.75 billion. As per the Coinglass data , the BNB futures open interest is also up by 10.72% to $875 million, suggesting a bullish outlook among traders. Binance Coin or BNB price has broken out of a descending channel pattern on the 4-hour timeframe, according to crypto analyst Pro Crypto Signals. “If BNB sustains its position above the channel structure, it could rally toward $720 in the coming days,” the analyst noted. Source: Pro Crypto Signals However, for a strong rally ahead, the BNB price needs to break past the crucial resistance of $630. This will set the stage for a major rally to the fresh all-time highs of $720, and beyond. Additionally, last week’s reports also suggest that the Trump family is eyeing a stake in Binance.US. However, Changpeng Zhao dismissed the rumors very soon stating that the WSJ article has been putting misleading information. BNB Chain Surpasses Solana In DEX Trading Volume Over the last 24 hours, the decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume on BNB Chain has crossed an impressive $1.64 billion, surpassing Solana to grab the top spot. he surge was largely driven by memecoins like Mubarak. SourcE: LookonChain PancakeSwap, the leading DEX on BNB Chain, also emerged as the platform with the highest trading volume within the same period, solidifying its dominance in the DeFi space. This highlights the growing activity and interest in the BNB Chain ecosystem, fueled by memecoin trading and decentralized finance innovations. Mubarak Meme Coin Jumps 71% The Mubarak meme coin has rallied by 71% in the last 24 hours on reports that Binance founder Changpeng Zhao has purchased $600 worth of the meme coin. As of press time, the meme coin is trading at $0.1304 with daily trading volumes at $123 million. On the other hand, many early investors reaped substantial profits. For example, Lookonchain recently revealed that one trader earned over $521,000 in profit by investing in MUBARAK.

In the meantime, BinanceCoin has gained the spotlight, recording decent gains compared to the other top 10 cryptos. The token has attracted more than 11% gains in the past seven days and nearly 5% in the past 24 hours. With the rise above $630 and a notable increase of over 25% in trading volume, the BNB price is expected to be the top performer among the large-cap cryptos in the upcoming days. BinanceSmart Chain TVL Surpass Solana BSC TVL is on the rise! In the past few months, the trading activity on Solana was extremely high. As a result, the platform surpassed the transaction volume, count, and TVL of popular chains like Ethereum. Meanwhile, BinanceSmart Chain (BSC) has surpassed Solana in terms of DEX volume and ranked first. Source: DefiLlama One of the reasons for the rapid increase is said to be an investment from Abu Dhabi-based MGX into Binance. Secondly, the sudden rise in the BSC-based tokens like Mubarak and Mashalla has also contributed to the BSC DEX volume. Once, Solana also experienced a similar rise, which faded with the drop of a couple of memecoin rug pulls. Therefore, with the rise of memecoin volume on BSC, there could be the possibility of another such event. How Will This Impact the BNB Price? BinanceCoin is known for its silent yet monstrous behavior, as it maintains a consistent rally without making a lot of noise. The price has risen to over $630 after rebounding from the lows close to $500. With this, the token is expected to break above the bearish pattern, which may help the BNB price to head towards new highs. As seen in the above chart, the BNB price broke down from the bullish pattern but remained within a descending parallel channel. Moreover, the 50-day and 200-day MAs underwent a bearish crossover, which is about to get reversed anytime from now. With this quick reversal, the price is expected to break the resistance of the descending channel and enter the rising parallel channel that it has held since August 2024. Meanwhile, the RSI is incremental, which suggests that bullish continuation could be imminent for the BinanceCoin (BNB) price for the week.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|BNB|SOL|ALTCOIN|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-17 07:45:00

In this event, they burned 31.15 million OKB tokens. They say that this takes the total burned number of OKB tokens up to 171 million, which is an impressive-sounding number. As the overall crypto market seems to be facing an extended downturn, it seems that exchanges like OKX are trying to use token scarcity as a way to maintain their tokens’ prices. OKX completed its 27th OKB token burn on March 14, burning 31,158,862 OKB worth $1.32 billion—a record high in both quantity and total value. So far, OKB has cumulatively burned 171 million tokens, leaving 129 million in circulation, for a 57.10% burn ratio. OKX previously stated… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 14, 2025 Implementing systematic burns of OKB is a key part of OKX’s strategy for managing supply and demand. This is unique to cryptocurrency exchanges, as most traditional financial markets cannot impact their asset’s supply like this. And under current regulatory scrutiny, most wouldn’t even attempt. Yet crypto exchanges can and do. They have a vested interest in ensuring that their tokens maintain value. And this is what makes the current strategy of OKX potentially harmful to both users and the larger market. Token Burns: A Deflationary Strategy to Combat Declining Spot Volumes OKX’s latest burn event comes at a time when spot trading volumes are declining across the major cryptocurrency exchanges. Conditions in the market are tough, buffeted by forces that are both global economic and long-term in nature, and a number of exchanges have been exploring user engagement ideas in an attempt to stop their partial vaporization. OKX has been implementing ideas to engage users, offering the chance to win the equivalent of $30,000 in Tether (USDT) as a carrot to keep its customers around for the kind of token burns that would partially inflate the value of the exchange’s ERC-20 token. These periodic burns create the illusion of scarcity, a tactic that can drive speculation and attract more investors. However, critics argue that while the short-term effects of such burns may be noticeable, the long-term impact on the overall value of a token remains uncertain. The burn strategy essentially works by buying back loyalty from token holders, particularly when the market sentiment is low and trading volumes are down. In times of low demand and declining prices, token burns act as a form of market manipulation—creating an artificial sense of value while the underlying fundamentals of the exchange and its offerings may not have changed drastically. These worries notwithstanding, token burns have established themselves as a useful tool in the crypto toolbox. For many projects that issue tokens, the act of burning those tokens is a way to create some short-term price action—positive price action, we should say—that keeps interest in the token alive even when the broader market is not so great. By reducing the total supply and keeping that even lower number in the public’s mind, these projects maintain the appearance of scarcity. OKX’s Ongoing Commitment to Deflationary Economics OKX has carried out numerous burn events over the years, with the most recent being just one among many. Through periodic burns, the exchange has eliminated a total of 171 million OKB tokens from circulation, showing a clear and sustained commitment to deflationary economics. This use of deflationary aspects in the perceived value of the native token aligns with a broader trend among crypto exchanges and projects seeking ways to increase the value of their tokens, attract new users, and retain existing ones amid uncertain market conditions. This strategy has its risks, as it can cause volatility and create a dependence on shifting short-term token prices. But for exchanges like OKX, which thrive on user engagement and participation, it’s an effective way to prop up token value in a bear market. And this approach fits well into the broader cryptocurrency narrative: if you can’t have it, you must want it. OKX and its rivals are in a space where they need to keep users close and keep them participating. Lopping off a sliver of a token here or there might do the trick in the short term—but it is, by far, not the most desirable method. Although the long-term effects of these token burns might not be fully realized yet, they are assuredly part of a large wave of efforts by cryptocurrency exchanges to raise the value of their tokens in the current bear market. They utilize them as deflationary mechanisms to try to create uppercase V, uppercase A, uppercase L, uppercase U, uppercase E in the eyes of anyone looking at their ecosystem—an utterly essential strategy when the overall market is looking sick. The Role of Exchanges in the Token Economy The most recent token burn from OKX emphasizes how much power cryptocurrency exchanges now wield over their native tokens. In traditional finance, there are laws that prevent companies from messing too much with supply and demand; otherwise, they’d just be burning money and creating inflation. But in crypto, it’s a different story. Exchanges can kind of do what they want with their native tokens, and they might as well use the tools at their disposal to make those tokens more appealing to buy and hold. That’s what OKX’s latest token burn seems to indicate. This power allows exchanges to control their tokenomics and create an environment where the value of their tokens can be manipulated to some degree. That kind of environment is especially valuable in a bear market when sentiment is otherwise hard to come by. While the long-term effects of these deflationary measures are yet to be fully understood, they are undoubtedly influencing the way that exchanges interact with their user bases and manage the economic forces that impact their tokens. To conclude, the 27th event of OKX’s token burn offers clear proof that exchanges are ramping up the use of deflationary strategies to influence the supply and demand of their tokens. By burning what constitutes a relatively large portion of its OKB supply, this exchange is propelling the demand and maintaining the value of its native token, all while market conditions are less than favorable for cryptocurrencies.

41797338,https://nulltx.com/?p=147144,1742197805,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,XRP Gains Major Recognition as U.S. and Dubai Embrace Ripple’s Digital Asset,https://nulltx.com/xrp-gains-major-recognition-as-u-s-and-dubai-embrace-ripples-digital-asset/,"In a groundbreaking move for the cryptocurrency industry, the SEC has now gone a step further to declare XRP as a “Strategic Asset for the U.S.” This appears to set the stage for a new era of digital asset integration, with the U.S. government now planning a pilot program to figure out the best way to use XRP within some of the most vital financial systems. According to the SEC document, XRP will not only serve in these pilot programs but also may wind up playing a key role in a ton of” core financial activities” in the U.S., such as tax refunds and social security, thereby becoming more integrated than ever into the U.S. financial infrastructure. Besides the increasing acceptance in the U.S., Ripple, the company behind XRP, has also received a substantial international boost. The Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) has given Ripple the thumbs-up to provide cryptographic payment and service solutions that use XRP in the region. These developments represent a watershed for both Ripple and the larger crypto industry. While some jurisdictions have grown shy about cryptocurrencies, XRP seems to be gaining traction in many international locales. XRP’s Role as a Strategic Asset in U.S. Financial Systems The recent SEC document, which officially designates XRP as a “Strategic Asset,” represents a major shift in the U.S. government’s view of cryptocurrencies. As part of this new initiative, the U.S. is set to launch a pilot program that aims to integrate XRP into key financial services, such as tax refunds and social security payments. This could have a huge ripple effect, as it would be a clear signal from the U.S. government that it is ready to use a digital asset in place of the dollars it normally uses to make such payments. BREAKING: The SEC posts $XRP document to website naming it as a 'Strategic Asset for the U.S."" The documents states that the U.S. will begin a pilot program to use $XRP for tax refunds and Social Security Integrations pic.twitter.com/GRlCugkgLy — CryptosRus (@CryptosR_Us) March 14, 2025 Including XRP in these pilot programs suggests that the potential benefits of digital currencies—namely, that they can help create faster, cheaper, and more efficient systems of payment—are something the U.S. government is bullish on. As we head into tax season, it’s likely that the pilot program will test the viability of XRP as a tool to facilitate tax refunds. From what we understand, the idea is to see if the currency can be used to send refunds in a way that is more streamlined and timely than what we’re currently doing. Also, could XRP be used to strengthen the systems that deliver social security payments? In a conversation with Ripple, I learned that using XRP for that purpose is something the company thinks can and should be done. This is a triumph for Ripple in its still-ongoing effort to create a bridge between the traditional financial system and blockchain technology. As more and more government entities look into using blockchain for public services, XRP stands to become a major tool in digital transformation within the public sector. Ripple Expands Reach with Dubai Approval XRP’s global acceptance extends well beyond the United States. Recently, the Ripple Network received a major regulatory green light from the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA), allowing the company to offer cryptocurrency payments and services using XRP in the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC). This development adds to the sense that Ripple is fast becoming a worldwide financial player. Dubai has emerged as a worldwide nexus of blockchain innovation and in mid-2020 established a favorable regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. Those moves align with the emirate’s strategy of nurturing the digital economy. By then, Dubai had well established itself as a global hub for many kinds of fintech, and Ripple was in discussions with the Dubai International Financial Centre, or DIFC. Meanwhile, Ripple was trying to secure a combination of necessary licenses and approvals from key financial regulators to refurbish its expansion in that part of the world. This approval also means increasing acceptance of cryptocurrencies into the traditional financial system. As Ripple establishes its presence in the Middle East, it can help speed along the adoption of XRP and similar digital assets into public and private sector uses across the region. XRP’s Growing Popularity: New Milestones and Record Highs XRP is wowing the market. The total number of XRP addresses just hit an all-time high of 6.87 million. That suggests ever-growing interest in and adoption of the cryptocurrency. In turn, that milestone—by no means a guarantee of an imminent price increase—does appear to suggest that the very base of the XRP user community is expanding. This spike in XRP addresses is representative of a larger trend in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, where digital assets are gaining much more traction and becoming much more mainstream. Why is this much more attention being directed to XRP? Well, the reason is that people and businesses from all over the world are using XRP to make payments toward a dazzling array of ‘use cases.’ In response to this much greater use of the XRP Ledger, demand for the digital asset itself grows and grows. The SEC recognizes XRP as a strategic asset. It has approved XRP for use in U.S. government programs. Ripple’s expansion into Dubai is, in part, a move to gain a foothold in the Asia-Pacific market. With these developments, XRP is becoming an increasingly integral part of the global financial landscape. The total number of $XRP addresses just hit an all-time high of 6.87 million! pic.twitter.com/clpBtKiPkl — Ali (@ali_charts) March 13, 2025 As we see these developments, it is quite clear that XRP is no longer just another cryptocurrency in the market. We see growing regulatory acceptance, and we see increased adoption. XRP is quickly becoming a cornerstone of the future of digital payments and the global financial system.

At this point, North Korea has become one of the largest BTC holders thanks to the activities of the Lazarus Group, a state-affiliated hacker group. According to Arkham data, Lazarus currently has 13,562 BTC worth $1.14 billion, making them a national piggy bank for cybercrime. This increase in the amount of BTC came after the Lazarus Group carried out a major cyber heist on February 21 by stealing more than $1.4 billion worth of Ethereum (ETH) from Bybit. Much of the money, initially Ethereum, was later converted to Bitcoin, bringing North Korea's assets to 13,562 BTC, worth over $1.14 billion. While North Korea has been quietly accumulating Bitcoin through illegal means, the US is taking a legal approach. President Trump officially launched the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve by signing an Executive Order on March 6. This puts the US as the country with the largest Bitcoin holdings with 198,109 BTC worth $16.71 billion. According to Arkham data, the United States ranks first with 198,109 BTC, followed by the United Kingdom with 61,245 BTC. North Korea ranks third, followed by Bhutan and El Salvador with 10,635 BTC and 6,117 BTC respectively. *This is not investment advice.

The first, Natural Gas (NGS) futures, reflects the kind of innovative trading opportunity that appears to be in ever-increasing demand, while the second, Cardano (ADA) futures, looks set to capture a good deal of attention in the burgeoning crypto trading space. Coinbase’s new futures contracts will live on Monday, March 31, as an crucial milestone for the company in diversifying its portfolio and offering a broader array of investment vehicles to traders. For crypto enthusiasts and institutional investors, Cardano futures are an important addition to the Coinbase offerings, as buying movements in the price of the cryptocurrency seem to have recently intensified. We're excited to announce that Coinbase Derivatives has filed with the CFTC to self-certify Natural Gas (NGS) futures and Cardano ( $ADA ) futures—expanding our offerings in both energy and crypto derivatives markets. We anticipate going live with these products on Monday,… pic.twitter.com/YZGmkb1TvM — Coinbase Institutional (@CoinbaseInsto) March 14, 2025 A Strategic Expansion into Energy and Crypto Derivatives The launch of energy and crypto futures products by Coinbase is a clear signal of the company’s ambition to serve a diverse group of market participants. Its new Natural Gas futures product will give investors a way to bet on the price of natural gas, a key energy commodity that has seen some wild price swings in recent years. This allows both institutions and retail investors to play in this vital market without having to deal with the hassle of owning physical natural gas. Simultaneously, adding Cardano futures to the platform marks a mammoth event in the cryptocurrency derivatives world. Cardano ($ADA), a leading force in the crypto space, has drawn considerable attention, given its unusual and forward-thinking approach to blockchain technology and its almost entirely new ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps) compared with the Ethereum-based ones. At the same time, Coinbase is attempting to grow its institutional trading business by capturing investor attention in the cryptocurrency derivatives space. Moving to offer futures contracts on these assets signals maturity not only in the energy markets but also in the cryptocurrency markets. As cryptocurrencies now gain a more robust, mainstream adoption, many energy traders also look to hedge against precursors that lead to price increases or volatility. Not that energy derivative models need help—energy prices are volatile. So why not give traders even more derivatives to play with? Whale Activity and Bullish Indicators for Cardano In the realm of cryptocurrency, few matters are as closely monitored as the sizable transactions conducted by the infamous “whales”—individuals or entities holding large amounts of a given asset. And over the past 72 hours, Cardano has seen quite the uptick in whale activity, with an estimated 130 million ADA tokens being swept up by large investors. Now, what does this all mean? Well, we can infer a couple of things. For starters, large investors appear to have an increasing level of confidence in the future price action of $ADA. Whales bought around 130 million #Cardano $ADA in the last 72 hours! pic.twitter.com/PTNomFSUdc — Ali (@ali_charts) March 15, 2025 Cardano’s price has notably been moving within a well-defined triangle pattern; this is often thought to be a consolidation phase before a breakout. Technical analysis suggests that once $ADA breaks free from this pattern, it could trigger a 15% price increase, possibly propelling the asset to new highs. This situation has traders and analysts eagerly awaiting the breakout, as it could signal a new phase of growth for the cryptocurrency. Whale activity is on the rise, and so is bullish sentiment. For Cardano and its upcoming futures launch on Coinbase, that means something interesting could happen soon. Why? Because these futures contracts could present a diversion of sorts for Cardano, one with a potentially beneficial effect on the asset’s price in the not-too-distant future. With institutional investors and traders moving into the crypto space, the demand for futures contracts as a means of hedging becomes vital. When it comes to $ADA, the coin with which we are presently working, it is worth noting that futures contracts on Cardano have yet to exist in the marketplace. Thus, Coinbase has made a first in an arena that will indubitably grow in the future. What This Means for Traders and the Market The self-certification by Coinbase of these two new futures products is a big deal for the derivatives market. Natural Gas and Cardano futures now are on offer from an exchange that is fully regulated in the United States. They are a new kind of investment vehicle, combining commodity trading with digital assets. For traders, that equals opportunity—more Diversification, better Risk Management. The cryptocurrency derivatives market is developing swiftly, thanks to the rising demand from big investors for fresh means of getting at digital assets. We’re seeing a proliferation of new products, from Cardano futures to who knows what else, that are not only increasing the sophistication of the crypto market but also allowing for some truly next-level trading strategies and a whole lot more liquidity. As the anticipated launch date of March 31 speeds toward us, all attention is focused on Coinbase as it gets set to roll out these thrilling new products for the public. For both energy and crypto traders, the new NGS and Cardano futures from Coinbase are a development that might just usher in a whole new age of growth, innovation, and opportunity in the derivatives market. Moving towards the official launch, the one sure thing is this: our expansion into energy and crypto derivatives represents our latest effort to provide you with new opportunities to trade in and interact with these dynamic markets. This is particularly true for our $ADA futures contract, not simply because Cardano’s recent momentum in the market places it among the most interesting of trading vehicles at the moment, but also because the sudden uptick in interest we’ve seen through the development of this contract places it among the most likely forthcoming offerings on our platform to be in high demand.

BTC touched resistance at $84,000 on Sunday, making it a key level to cross for chances of a run to the upside and trading at just over $83,300 in Asian afternoon hours Monday. Majors such as XRP, Solana’s (SOL), Cardano’s (ADA) and dogecoin (DOGE) tanked as much as 5%, while BNB Chain’s (BNB) stood out as the only major in green with a 3% rise. The crypto market has plateaued since last week's sell-off due to the U.S. tariffs and deteriorating macroeconomic conditions. Concerns over a U.S. recession is growing due to Trump's tariffs, traders say, with the likelihood of choppiness ahead as a correlation with U.S. equities staying intact. Still, some see oncoming volatility in altcoins and memecoins amid a flat market regime. “Trading volume has increased for altcoins after Trump's World Liberty Financial bought MNT and AVAX, the latter of which was also part of an ETF application by VanEck,” Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, said in a Telegram message. “This may be a sign that traders and investors will focus on altcoins in the short term for better gains compared to large-cap coins like Bitcoin or Ethereum.” Traders say the current sell-off could have been caused by an unwinding of ETF and spot-linked traders. “The current belief is that the current sell-off is entirely driven by the massive 'multi-strat' hedge fund strategies that have dominated the macro space,” Augustine Fan, Head of Insights at SignalPlus, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. Multi-strategy (multi-strat) trades involve hedge funds using diverse tactics — like arbitrage, long-short positions, and leverage — to maximize returns across asset classes. In bitcoin’s case, a popular multi-strat approach is the basis trade where funds buy spot BTC(often via ETFs) and short BTC futures to profit from price differences. This locks in low-risk gains when the spread is favorable. When profits from basis trades shrink, due to tighter spreads or market shifts , funds exit positions, selling bitcoin and ETF shares en masse. This liquidation pressure likely amplified the sell-off, especially amid tariff-related volatility in the past week. However, the “buy-the-dip” mentality persists among bulls. “Equity valuations outside of the major large caps are relatively contained vs historical averages, and economic hard data is likely to outperform the rapid deterioration in soft data, so market consensus is that this remains a 'buy the dip' market while we work through the tariff volatility,” Fan added.",Markets,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|ADA|SOL|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-17 07:52:35

41797493,https://nulltx.com/?p=147142,1742198075,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Dogecoin ($DOGE) Sees Surge in Activity as Memecoin Hype Fades: Is It Time to Buy?,https://nulltx.com/dogecoin-doge-sees-surge-in-activity-as-memecoin-hype-fades-is-it-time-to-buy/,"The well-known cryptocurrency inspired by memes, Dogecoin ($DOGE), has been experiencing a surge in on-chain activity of late. This has meant new attention from both traders and long-term investors. Santiment, a firm that tracks cryptocurrency metrics, reports that the number of daily active addresses on the Dogecoin network has surged by an eye-catching 400% to almost 395,000. This impressive increase has led to some conversations about whether Dogecoin is in the process of making a comeback. #Dogecoin $DOGE on fire! On-chain data from @santimentfeed shows that active addresses skyrocketed 400% to nearly 395,000. pic.twitter.com/5WuDKjx64K — Ali (@ali_charts) March 15, 2025 Although the performance of Dogecoin during the last few months has been largely determined by the overall meme coin environment—which has cooled since its summer highs—recent price action and on-chain metrics suggest that the Dogecoin still has plenty of upside potential for investors. Reclaiming Support: Dogecoin’s Recovery and Market Potential Dogecoin has reclaimed the support of its seven-month trendline, an important technical indicator that has many traders watching closely. This could signal a turnaround for the meme currency—if not a full-on pump, then at least a moment of price stabilization after a prolonged descent. Currently, Dogecoin is priced at about $0.061, down roughly 75% from its all-time high of $0.731 that it achieved in the fourth quarter of 2021. What is especially noteworthy is that Dogecoin has recovered its trendline support, even though it is down considerably from its all-time high. This is a strong indication that, despite the turbulence it has faced, the coin is holding a lot of value right where it is at present. For many, this begs the question: Is now a good time to start acquiring $DOGE tokens for a long-term hold? $DOGE has reclaimed its 7-month trendline support. It's down 75% from its Q4 peak and has almost erased Trump's win gain. I think now is the right time to start bidding on DOGE for the long-term. Memecoin hype is dead which makes DOGE look even better from an investment… pic.twitter.com/XQA7iZ1BJD — Cas Abbé (@cas_abbe) March 15, 2025 Some analysts see the subsiding memecoin frenzy as a positive development for Dogecoin. They believe that the end of the speculative rush may allow for stabilization in the value of Dogecoin, giving it more room to grow in a less volatile, more sustainable environment. With much of the hype surrounding memecoins dissipating, they see the future price movements of Dogecoin as being less susceptible to the kind of erratic fluctuations driven by social media trends and celebrity endorsements that have historically made it look, to some investors, like more of a traditional investment. The Role of Memecoins and the Dogecoin Narrative Dogecoin, first created as a joke in 2013, has long been connected to the craze for cryptocurrencies that are aligned with Internet memes. At the peak of the memecoin boom, Dogecoin was inarguably one of the top memecoins, especially because it had the backing of such high-profile figures as Elon Musk, who was frequently mentioning the coin in his tweets. This led to some pretty wild price movements, again inarguably connected to Musk’s involvement, and at one point, when the meme market was absolutely going off, Dogecoin attained an all-time high. Nevertheless, when the speculative craze surrounding meme tokens seemed to be winding down, many of these coins, Dogecoin included, were taking steep falls in value. At the top, $DOGE had not just reached but had been said to have “soared to nearly $0.75,” and not just fell back but “shed most of its gains” when it returned to the bottom. Despite this steep decline, a loyal community still follows Dogecoin. That community turns to the Dogecoin Twitter account for the latest news. And while it’s not quite exclusive, Dogecoin’s community still advocates for its use as a “medium of exchange and store of value.” Can you believe these people? A blessing in disguise might be coming for Dogecoin as the memecoin loss of hype moves ever closer. With the market turning away from tokens that can only hope to be part of the next meme, we might just be moving toward a time when the only coins that get bought are those with signs of actual utility or long-term potential. By those measures, Dogecoin should survive in style. Dogecoin’s Long-Term Investment Prospects Though the meme coin fervor driving Dogecoin to great heights may now be over, this could provide an opportune moment for discerning investors to purchase what might be an undervalued asset. As $DOGE seeks to establish itself within the market, retaking key levels of support and enjoying a not-insignificant increase in activity, the cryptocurrency seems on track to carve out a more stable and sustainable price path going forward. Additionally, Dogecoin remains an asset in the crypto sphere because of its market cap, community, and recognition. It stands apart from many other cryptocurrencies for its widespread acknowledgment and ease of use, despite its seemingly basic functionality. Its loyal community makes it all the more endearing; Dogecoin may not be your typical crypto, but it has so many friends that one can hardly consider it an underdog. Those who believe in Dogecoin’s potential are still out there, as the spike in active addresses seems to show. We’ve seen that in the last few weeks, with a large number of traders and investors seemingly not caring about the memecoin label and instead treating Dogecoin as something that could potentially be a long-term hold. This uptick in interest could be what drives Dogecoin’s price back up, since it seems like a sizable number of people now view the asset as something that could rebound. Is Now the Right Time to Bid on $DOGE? If you are thinking about moving into Dogecoin, the current market conditions present a compelling case. Even though the coin has substantially declined from its Q4 2024–peak, $DOGE’s recent trendline support suggests that the Dogecoin might be stabilizing and have future growth potential as market conditions improve. As the hype around memecoins dissipates, Dogecoin’s fundamentals—an active community, an established presence in the crypto ecosystem, and strong on-chain data—emerge as significant factors in its possible resurgence. Even though the crypto market is still in flux, Dogecoin’s recent performance and on-chain metrics give a pretty positive outlook for the future. If you’re a long-term investor looking to diversify with a familiar asset that has a lot of potential to appreciate, $DOGE might be one of the best bets you can make right now. We don’t know if it will ever reclaim the heights it reached in 2021 or if it will establish some new baseline, but in talking with people who follow it closely, the best seems yet to come.

Stablecoin Data Suggests We’re Still in the Mid-Cycle,https://nulltx.com/are-we-at-the-market-peak-stablecoin-data-suggests-were-still-in-the-mid-cycle/,"With the uncertainty and volatility seen in the cryptocurrency market of late, many investors watch key indicators with bated breath. Those indicators might tell us whether the market has hit its zenith or if it can still climb higher. One clear signal this time around, though, could have saved us a lot of the nail-biting we’ve endured. That signal is the supply of stablecoins. Whatever stablecoins are, their supply curve is a key chart to watch if you’re trying to get a read on the future direction of the cryptocurrency market. In the past, the availability of stablecoins has closely followed the ups and downs of the crypto market. When availability goes up, it usually signifies that investors are being more cautious or are getting ready for some kind of market movement. And when we’re trying to gauge the overall market sentiment, the availability of stablecoins is something to pay attention to. So, as we sit here in 2024, the supply of stablecoins has reached new highs, and this chart gives a glimpse into what might be happening behind the scenes. Stablecoins Surge as a Sign of Market Uncertainty Continued growth this week has brought the total supply of stablecoins to $219 billion. This is emblematic of the surging demand for these relatively stable digital assets in the current crypto environment. Until fairly recently, we had a fairly clear picture of which digital assets served as the foundation of the decentralized finance (DeFi) market. Now, unclear developments regarding the regulatory fate of both stablecoins and the blockchain APIs underpinning these assets have injected a healthy dose of uncertainty across the crypto space. Stablecoins continue to gain ground amid market uncertainty, pushing their combined market cap to around $219 billion this week. Remarkably, they’re now only $10 billion away from Ethereum’s market cap, a strong indicator of rising caution in the market. pic.twitter.com/35O5fbyeLW — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) March 14, 2025 Key buildup componenitn the marke’s liquidity gthat allows investors to quickly transact in the market.’This is enhanced liquidity, and that means an assured pathway to the potential stability we can have in our space…during the occurrences of market upheaval.’ Marc Zeller of blockchain payment provider Aave says that with stablecoin supply continuing to rise in the current market, this means that “investors are hedging their positions and not engaging large-scale risk-taking.” Comparing Stablecoin Supply to Previous Market Cycles The peak supply of stablecoins has tracked closely with the high points of market cycles. A prime example of this was in April 2022, when the supply of stablecoins reached $187 billion. The broader cryptocurrency market was then near its own peak, just before a huge downturn shaved down the prices of all major digital assets and sent them into a bear market that has lasted a couple of years and counting. This close-together timing of the peak in stablecoin supply and the nearly coincident downturn in the prices of a whole bunch of other digital assets really brought home an important point: Stablecoins are supposed to be stable, and in most ways they are, but their relationship with the prices of major digital assets is not nearly as stable. Is the market peak in? Stablecoin data suggests otherwise. Historically, stablecoin supply peaks align with cycle highs. In April 2022, supply hit $187B—just as the bear market started. Now it’s at $219B and still rising, suggesting we’re likely still mid-cycle. pic.twitter.com/938qCmEY9I — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) March 14, 2025 Currently, the stablecoin supply has reached $219 billion. It is still going up, and signs are not pointing toward any slow down. In fact, many analysts feel that the situation is calling into question the common narrative that we are in some kind of market peak. What if we're mid-cycle instead? The increasing stablecoin supply could just suggest investors are remaining on the sidelines and waiting to jump back into the market with the next wave of price action. If that is what is happening, then the rising stablecoin market cap might just suggest that we have more room to run. Moreover, the present offering of stablecoins is a mere $10 billion short of matching Ethereum’s market capitalization, which serves to accentuate the surging prominence of stablecoins in the overall cryptocurrency realm. No longer an afterthought, stablecoins are now a serious player. They have a seriously large market cap, and it is becoming seriously close to the market caps of some of the largest, most day-rated cryptocurrencies on the blockchain. The Significance of Stablecoin Market Cap Near Ethereum’s Defensive assets typically fall into three categories: (1) liquid and high-quality securities, (2) low-risk, below-market-return investments, and (3) cash, the ultimate safe haven that earns little but is far from losing anything. Stablecoins mimic cash because they are, in terms of their structure, calls on the liabilities of the cash-issuing institutions. When we talk about the current situation with cash and stablecoins, we need to understand what cash is in a world in which most money exists only in electronic form. A benchmark for the crypto market’s health has always been set by Ethereum’s market cap. As the second-largest crypto by market cap, its moves resonate throughout the rest of the market. Stablecoins being near this level of market cap speaks to their current market sentiment. Investors seem to be looking for more stable options to put their capital in, and the growth in the stablecoin supply reflects that hesitation. It is particularly important to note that stablecoins have remained robust against the backdrop of a more volatile overall crypto market. While many virtual currencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, have suffered grievous price declines, stablecoins have stayed at or near their pegged value. Presumably, that has afforded both traders and long-term investors a kind of security as they navigate the current crypto landscape. And this behavior is becoming even more evident as uncertainty in the market escalates. Are We Still Mid-Cycle? Given the continued rise in stablecoin supply, we can make a pretty safe bet that the peak of this current market cycle is well ahead of us. The last time we saw such a sharp ascent in supply was in late 2021, just before the market took a nosedive. The correlation between stablecoin supply and the direction of the market is pretty close to 1, which means that in both instances where we have seen new all-time highs in the market, the supply of stablecoins has also been at an all-time high. Furthermore, the fact that stablecoins are now playing a central role in the market could be considered additional evidence that we’re in a consolidation period. This doesn’t scream panic to me as far as price action is concerned, but it could suggest that the market is banking on some kind of forthcoming price-moving event—regulatory clarity, perhaps, or a big institutional buy—that could really get things going again. To sum up, although the market looks to be at a crossroads, the ever-rising stablecoin supply indicates a still-ongoing cycle of uncertainty and caution, not an about-to-peak market. Investors are getting themselves positioned with liquidity for the next inevitability to swing our way. And with the supply of stablecoins now nearly capped at Ethereum’s market cap, the stablecoin trend presently looks like one fairly engaged in a broader cycle of development, with lots more stability to come.

What accounts for this surge? A combination of seemingly inexhaustible market demand, technological development, and the relentless evolution of the crypto trading space. Centralized exchanges still take the lion’s share of the market, but decentralized platforms are making quite a name for themselves, too, with new entrants like Hyperliquid also showing some very impressive growth numbers. With Bitcoin’s ongoing lead in open interest and DEXs now enjoying some very rapid top-line growth of their own, the cloud of the crypto perpetual market is obviously setting some very high precedents for itself over this year. CEX Perpetual Trading: A Dominant Surge In 2024, centralized exchange perpetual volumes have climbed to new peaks, achieving a mind-boggling $58.5 trillion traded on these platforms. This is a huge leap compared to previous years and shows that CEXs are still dominating the crypto trading space. When it comes to the top 10 centralized perpetual exchanges, we saw a serious increase there as well. Those exchanges reached a combined trading volume of $21.2 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2024 alone, which represented a monthly growth rate of 79.6% from the third quarter. Even though this may seem to suggest that the competition is getting stronger, it really just shows that Binance’s most significant rival is itself. This top-level competitor can be thought of as a slightly lower fee structure; a steadily declining number of trading pairs, especially with margin trading; the straightforward perpetual trading platform; and a couple of friends: a section of the website that encourages and instructs people to use limit orders, and a video that makes limit orders seem as easy as using a market order. This year, one of the most important developments in perpetual trading on centralized exchanges (CEXs) was the appearance of Coinbase in the list of top 10 perpetual exchanges. This is the first time that the San Francisco-based exchange has appeared in that category, and it came after an almost fourfold increase in the exchange’s trading volume from October to December 2022. That increase suggests that Coinbase, which is now working with several top-tier market makers, has a better chance of being included in the list of traders’ favorites. DEX Perpetual Trading: A Growing Presence Perpetual trading volume growth was also impressive in 2024, on the decentralized exchange side. While the decentralized exchange (DEX) perpetual market is still smaller than the centralized exchange (CEX) perpetual market, the top 10 decentralized exchanges together tallied $492.8 billion in total trading volume in Q4 2024, per Dune Analytics, which was a 55.9% increase from Q3 2024. State of Crypto Perpetuals Market 2024 Report is NOW LIVE Crypto perpetual trading hit new highs in 2024, with both centralized and decentralized exchanges seeing record-breaking volumes. Here are 3 key highlights you shouldn't miss pic.twitter.com/jL35SWUwgV — CoinGecko (@coingecko) March 14, 2025 Hyperliquid became the clear leader in the DEX perpetual market, taking over 55% of the market share by Q4. They peaked in December, shortly after they did a $HYPE airdrop, which sent trading activity surging. The result—with the look of an effective way to boost engagement—was the platform was clearly successful. And overall, the platform highlights something really interesting about decentralized exchanges: Despite the common perception of crypto being dead these days, they might actually be on to something in our ongoing tealocal news tour for the CEX model. In the meantime, another decentralized platform, JupiterExchange, cemented its position as the second-largest perpetual DEX. Yet, it’s essential to underscore that perpetual exchanges based on Solana still made up only about 15% of the overall DEX volumes. On the upside, these Solana DEXs are showing much more rapid growth than their on-chain peers, which might suggest a change in the Solana decentralized trading landscape. The question is, why? Bitcoin and Open Interest: Continued Dominance Although perpetual trading volumes grew significantly in both centralized and decentralized exchange markets, Bitcoin continued to dominate the perpetual trading landscape. By November 2024, the top central exchanges had accumulated over $100 billion in open interest, and they maintained that number for the rest of the year. Of that amount, around 45% came from Bitcoin, with a little more than 20% from Ethereum, and the decentralized exchange Solana having just 4%. It is not surprising that Bitcoin dominates perpetual trading, given that it is the most recognized and traded cryptocurrency. Its continued leadership in open interest underscores its central role in the crypto markets and the appetition for perpetual contracts tied to the asset. Moreover, Bitcoin’s role in open interest has been reinforced by a series of noteworthy events, including significant price movements and major institutional interest all throughout 2024. The trading volume of Solana’s perpetual contracts shot up at certain times in 2024, among them the following: – March 15, mid-week – June 24, Friday – August 1, Tuesday What correlated with those spikes? Solana’s underpinned assets were part of the conversation in trading circles, especially around those dates most likely because the tokens being discussed were also surging. Looking Ahead: A Thriving Market Perpetual trading in crypto seems to have a bright future ahead. Both centralized exchanges (CEX) and decentralized exchanges (DEX) are experiencing growth. Innovations are aplenty, and the desire for crypto derivatives keeps surging. We remain in an era where Bitcoin (BTC) reigns supreme. At the same time, platforms like Hyperliquid are emerging. They and many other decentralized platforms are building the next wave of trading opportunities in an increasingly diverse markets. Moving forward into 2024, decentralized exchanges will have a chance to prove their staying power against centralized ones. An ever-growing number of retail and institutional traders appear to be gravitating toward decentralized finance (DeFi). Where might the perpetual volume balance between CEX and DEX be headed? Currently, the crypto perpetual market is booming, and traders are keenly observing the ongoing evolution of both centralized exchange (CEX) and decentralized exchange (DEX) platforms. Enhanced innovation and heightened adoption are setting the stage for 2024 to be a year of substantial evolution for perpetual contracts within the crypto ecosystem.

Here’s what to do next,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/victim-of-a-crypto-scam-heres-what-to-do-next?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"Beware of various forms of cryptocurrency scams Cryptocurrency scams can manifest in various forms, often preying on the lack of regulation and the complexity of blockchain transactions. You must be aware of common tactics used in cryptocurrency scams. These include: Phishing scams: Attackers send fraudulent emails or messages that mimic legitimate cryptocurrency platforms . Victims may be tricked into providing sensitive information such as private keys or login credentials. Ponzi schemes: Promises of high returns with little to no risk lure investors into schemes that eventually collapse , leaving many with significant losses. Fake ICOs: Fraudulent projects present a compelling investment opportunity, only to disappear after collecting funds. Rug pulls: In decentralized finance (DeFi) , developers of a project could suddenly withdraw all funds from a liquidity pool, leaving investors with worthless tokens. This malicious act is called a rug pull , and it typically occurs after a project has gained enough momentum and unsuspecting investors have bought into it. Social media impersonations: Cybercriminals impersonate reputable influencers or customer support accounts . They use social media to solicit investments or send links that compromise security. Always cross-check identities through official channels. AI-powered scams: AI-powered scams in the crypto space involve advanced tools like phishing bots, deepfakes and exploit bots, which can automatically create convincing fake messages or manipulate platforms to steal funds. These scams are increasingly sophisticated, making it harder for users to spot fraudulent activities and putting digital assets at greater risk. Immediate steps: What to do after a crypto scam If you suspect you have fallen victim to a crypto scam, taking prompt action is crucial. Here’s a step-by-step guide on what to do after a crypto scam: 1. Secure your accounts: Change passwords and enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on your cryptocurrency accounts. Transfer the remaining funds to a secure wallet to minimize further risk. 2. Document the incident: Keep records of all communications, transaction IDs and any other relevant details. This documentation will be essential for recovery efforts and legal action against crypto scams, if possible. 3. Report the scam: Contact local law enforcement and financial regulatory bodies. Many countries have dedicated cybercrime units that can investigate such incidents. File a complaint with consumer protection agencies and report the scam on platforms like the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the UK or the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), a division of the FBI that handles internet-related crimes in the US. You can also report cryptocurrency fraud to Action Fraud in the UK, which will then escalate the case to the National Crime Agency (NCA), which is responsible for investigating major cybercrimes and financial fraud. 4. Seek professional guidance: Consult legal experts specializing in digital assets for legal action regarding crypto scams. They can help navigate the complex legal landscape and potentially assist in recovering lost funds. Engage cybersecurity professionals who can provide crypto fraud help and advice on strengthening your digital security. 5. Monitor and track transactions: Utilize blockchain explorers to trace the movement of your stolen assets. Although cryptocurrencies are designed for transparency, identifying the destination of funds can be challenging without professional assistance. Consider reaching out to companies specializing in blockchain analytics for a detailed investigation. Did you know? Argentine President Javier Milei’s X post endorsing the LIBRA token briefly sent its market cap soaring to $4 billion — only for him to delete it hours later, triggering a crash that wiped out millions in investor funds. How to report a cryptocurrency scam in the US Reporting crypto scams in the US can be challenging because responsibility is spread across multiple agencies at the federal, state and local levels. Before reporting any scam, keep all transaction records, screenshots, emails and any other communications related to the fraud. Determine if it was a phishing attack, fake investment or another form of fraud. This helps in categorizing the complaint accurately. The next steps in reporting the scam are as follows: Federal reporting FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3): This is one of the primary platforms for reporting online financial crimes, including those involving cryptocurrencies. Although many victims report scams through IC3, feedback is often minimal, underscoring the need for a more responsive system. Additional Federal Agencies: Depending on the nature of the scam, you might also consider contacting regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) if the fraud involves investment scams. State and local authorities Local law enforcement: File a report with your local police or cybercrime unit. They can sometimes offer immediate assistance or direct you to specialized resources. State regulators: Some states have dedicated offices for financial protection. For example, in California, authorities like the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) have been actively addressing emerging crypto scams , from fake mining schemes to fraudulent investment groups. Given the fragmented crypto crime reporting system in the US, industry leaders have called for a streamlined, centralized reporting system that not only consolidates data from various agencies but also offers victims a way to track the status of their complaints. While this system is not yet in place, being aware of this need can help you set realistic expectations and encourage further advocacy. Engage with specialized support Legal consultation: Many crypto scams are orchestrated from overseas, making cross-border cooperation essential. A lawyer specialized in cryptocurrency or cybercrime in your jurisdiction could help you navigate the legal system and work with the appropriate agencies. Blockchain analysis firms: Some companies offer forensic services to trace the movement of funds on the blockchain. However, ensure you thoroughly research these firms to avoid further scams. Is it possible to recover crypto lost in scams? It’s one of the toughest questions for anyone scammed in the crypto space: Can I get my lost crypto back? Unfortunately, the short answer is that recovery can be incredibly difficult, but it’s not impossible. Crypto transactions, by nature, are irreversible . Once you send crypto to a scammer’s wallet, no central authority like a bank can reverse the transaction. However, there are still a few steps you can take to attempt recovery and minimize future risks. First, report the scam by contacting local authorities, such as Action Fraud in the UK or the FBI’s IC3 in the US. While they may not be able to recover your funds directly, reporting the incident creates a record of the scam, which could help in more extensive investigations or lead to action against the scammers in the future. Crypto exchanges and wallet providers may also be able to assist if the scam involves funds sent to or received by a platform they control. Contact their support team immediately. Although the likelihood of recovery from an exchange is slim, some platforms may freeze accounts or funds related to suspicious activities. Use blockchain forensics services that specialize in tracing the flow of stolen cryptocurrency on the blockchain. They might help you track where your funds went, and sometimes, this information can be handed over to law enforcement to assist with investigations. However, if your funds were sent to a private wallet or mixed through services designed to obscure transactions, recovery becomes significantly more challenging. While it may not always feel like there’s hope, acting quickly and understanding the complexities of crypto recovery can make a difference. Remember, the best recovery tactic is prevention; staying informed is your first defense. Did you know? Elliptic, a blockchain analytics firm, traced funds stolen in the record-breaking $1.5 billion Bybit hack to the North Korean Lazarus Group, which laundered the assets through exchanges like eXch. Preventative measures: Avoiding cryptocurrency scams Preventing future scams is as critical as recovering from one. Avoiding cryptocurrency scams is all about staying informed and cautious. Implement the following measures to reduce your risk: Do your homework: Before investing in any project or platform, take the time to research. Look into the team behind it, read the white paper and check out reviews from reputable sources. If you can’t find clear, verifiable information or something feels off, trust your instincts and steer clear. Stay updated on scam tactics: The tactics used by scammers are constantly evolving. Familiarize yourself with common scams like phishing, AI-powered or impersonation scams. Following crypto news and joining reputable online communities can keep you informed about the latest warning signs. Question “too-good-to-be-true” offers: If someone promises sky-high returns with little risk, it’s likely a red flag . In crypto, as in any investment, high rewards usually come with high risks. A legitimate opportunity won’t pressure you with unrealistic promises. Verify websites and emails: Scammers often create lookalike websites and send fake emails that mimic trusted services. Always double-check URLs and email addresses, and if something doesn’t match the official website or seems unusual, avoid clicking on any links. Secure your digital assets: Treat your crypto wallets like a personal safe. Use hardware wallets for long-term storage, enable 2FA on all accounts and never share your private keys or recovery phrases. Think of your private keys as the keys to your house — keep them secure and private. Take your time: Scammers love to create urgency with “limited-time offers” or “exclusive deals.” If you’re being rushed into a decision, pause and do your research. Legitimate opportunities will still be available after you’ve had time to verify the details. Diversify your investments: Never put all your money into one asset or project. Diversification helps manage risk and protects you if one investment turns out to be less secure than expected. Seek trusted opinions: If you’re unsure about an investment or an offer, ask for advice from knowledgeable friends or community members. Trusted crypto communities and forums can be great for getting second opinions — but always be cautious and cross-check the information. By staying vigilant, questioning deals that seem too good to be true and taking simple security measures, you can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to crypto scams. It’s all about being cautious and making informed decisions.

Experts Predict Explosive Growth By 2035,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-10-million-explosive-growth-by-2035/,"In a new publication titled The Mustard Seed, Joe Burnett—Director of Market Research at Unchained—outlines a thesis that envisions Bitcoin reaching $10 million per coin by 2035. This inaugural quarterly letter takes the long view, focusing on “time arbitrage” as it surveys where Bitcoin, technology, and human civilization could stand a decade from now. Burnett’s argument revolves around two principal transformations that, he contends, are setting the stage for an unprecedented migration of global capital into Bitcoin: (1) the “Great Flow of Capital” into an asset with absolute scarcity, and (2) the “Acceleration of Deflationary Technology” as AI and robotics reshape entire industries. A Long-Term Perspective On Bitcoin Most economic commentary zooms in on the next earnings report or the immediate price volatility. In contrast, The Mustard Seed announces its mission clearly: “Unlike most financial commentary that fixates on the next quarter or next year, this letter takes the long view—identifying profound shifts before they become consensus.” At the core of Burnett’s outlook is the observation that the global financial system—comprising roughly $900 trillion in total assets—faces ongoing risks of “dilution or devaluation.” Bonds, currencies, equities, gold, and real estate each have expansionary or inflationary components that erode their store-of-value function: Gold ($20 trillion): Mined at approximately 2% annually, increasing supply and slowly diluting its scarcity. Real Estate ($300 trillion): Expands at around 2.4% per year due to new development. Equities ($110 trillion): Company profits are constantly eroded by competition and market saturation, contributing to devaluation risk. Fixed Income & Fiat ($230 trillion): Structurally subject to inflation, which reduces purchasing power over time. Burnett describes this phenomenon as capital “searching for a lower potential energy state,” likening the process to water cascading down a waterfall. In his view, all pre-Bitcoin asset classes were effectively “open bounties” for dilution or devaluation. Wealth managers could distribute capital among real estate, bonds, gold, or stocks, but each category carried a mechanism by which its real value could erode. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Peak In? This Data Suggests Otherwise, Analytics Firm Says Enter Bitcoin, with its 21-million-coin hard cap. Burnett sees this digital asset as the first monetary instrument incapable of being diluted or devalued from within. Supply is fixed; demand, if it grows, can directly translate into price appreciation. He cites Michael Saylor’s “waterfall analogy”: “Capital naturally seeks the lowest potential energy state—just as water flows downhill. Before bitcoin, wealth had no true escape from dilution or devaluation. Wealth stored in every asset class acted as a market bounty, incentivizing dilution or devaluation.” As soon as Bitcoin became widely recognized, says Burnett, the game changed for capital allocation. Much like discovering an untapped reservoir far below existing water basins, the global wealth supply found a new outlet—one that cannot be augmented or diluted. To illustrate Bitcoin’s unique supply dynamics, The Mustard Seed draws a parallel with the halving cycle. In 2009, miners received 50 BTC per block—akin to Niagara Falls at full force. As of today, the reward dropped to 3.125 BTC, reminiscent of halving the Falls’ flow repeatedly until it is significantly reduced. In 2065, Bitcoin’s newly minted supply will be negligible compared to its total volume, mirroring a waterfall reduced to a trickle. Though Burnett concedes that attempts to quantify Bitcoin’s global adoption rely on uncertain assumptions, he references two models: the Power Law Model which projects $1.8 million per BTC by 2035 and Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin model which suggests $2.1 million per BTC by 2035. He counters that these projections might be “too conservative” because they often assume diminishing returns. In a world of accelerating technological adoption—and a growing realization of Bitcoin’s properties—price targets could overshoot these models significantly. The Acceleration Of Deflationary Technology A second major catalyst for Bitcoin’s upside potential, per The Mustard Seed, is the deflationary wave brought on by AI, automation, and robotics. These innovations rapidly increase productivity, lower costs, and make goods and services more abundant. By 2035, Burnett believes global costs in several key sectors could undergo dramatic reductions. Adidas’ “Speedfactories” cut sneaker production from months to days. The scaling of 3D printing and AI-driven assembly lines could slash manufacturing costs by 10x. 3D-printed homes already go up 50x faster at far lower costs. Advanced supply-chain automation, combined with AI logistics, could make quality housing 10x cheaper. Autonomous ride-hailing can potentially reduce fares by 90% by removing labor costs and improving efficiency. Burnett underscores that, under a fiat system, natural deflation is often “artificially suppressed.” Monetary policies—like persistent inflation and stimulus—inflate prices, masking technology’s real impact on lowering costs. Bitcoin, on the other hand, would let deflation “run its course,” increasing purchasing power for holders as goods become more affordable. In his words: “A person holding 0.1 BTC today (~$10,000) could see its purchasing power increase 100x or more by 2035 as goods and services become exponentially cheaper.” To illustrate how supply growth erodes a store of value over time, Burnett revisits gold’s performance since 1970. Gold’s nominal price from $36 per ounce to roughly $2,900 per ounce in 2025 appears substantial, but that price gain was continuously diluted by the annual 2% increase in gold’s overall supply. Over five decades, the global stock of gold almost tripled. If gold’s supply had been static, its price would have hit $8,618 per ounce by 2025, according to Burnett’s calculations. This supply constraint would have bolstered gold’s scarcity, possibly pushing demand and price even higher than $8,618. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaches 12-Year Support Line Against Gold – Is The Bull Run Over? Bitcoin, by contrast, incorporates precisely the fixed supply condition that gold never had. Any new demand will not spur additional coin issuance and thus should drive the price upward more directly. Burnett’s forecast for a $10 million Bitcoin by 2035 would imply a total market cap of $200 trillion. While that figure sounds colossal, he points out that it represents only about 11% of global wealth—assuming global wealth continues to expand at a ~7% annual rate. From this vantage point, allocating around 11% of the world’s assets into what The Mustard Seed calls “the best long-term store of value asset” might not be far-fetched. “Every past store of value has perpetually expanded in supply to meet demand. Bitcoin is the first that cannot.” A key piece of the puzzle is the security budget for Bitcoin: miner revenue. By 2035, Bitcoin’s block subsidy will be down to 0.78125 BTC per block. At $10 million per coin, miners could earn $411 billion in aggregate revenue each year. Since miners sell the Bitcoin they earn to cover costs, the market would have to absorb $411 billion of newly mined BTC annually. Burnett draws a parallel with the global wine market, which was valued at $385 billion in 2023 and is projected to reach $528 billion by 2030. If a “mundane” sector like wine can sustain that level of consumer demand, an industry securing the world’s leading digital store of value reaching similar scale, he argues, is well within reason. Despite public perception that Bitcoin is becoming mainstream, Burnett highlights an underreported metric: “The number of people worldwide with $100,000 or more in bitcoin is only 400,000… that’s 0.005% of the global population—just 5 in 100,000 people.” Meanwhile, studies might show around 39% of Americans have some level of “direct or indirect” Bitcoin exposure, but this figure includes any fractional ownership—such as holding shares of Bitcoin-related equities or ETFs through mutual funds and pension plans. Real, substantial adoption remains niche. “If Bitcoin is the best long-term savings technology, we would expect anyone with substantial savings to hold a substantial amount of bitcoin. Yet today, virtually no one does.” Burnett emphasizes that the road to $10 million does not require Bitcoin to supplant all money worldwide—only to “absorb a meaningful percentage of global wealth.” The strategy for forward-looking investors, he contends, is simple but non-trivial: ignore short-term noise, focus on the multi-year horizon, and act before global awareness of Bitcoin’s properties becomes universal. “Those who can see past the short-term volatility and focus on the bigger picture will recognize bitcoin as the most asymmetric and overlooked bet in global markets.” In other words, it is about “front-running the capital migration” while Bitcoin’s user base is still comparatively minuscule and the vast majority of traditional wealth remains in legacy assets. At press time, BTC traded at $83,388.

A recent post on X (formerly Twitter) by Binance CEO, Changpeng Zhao, better known as CZ, is a prime example of this. Following his post, the price of $MUBARAK rocketed up by a jaw-dropping 400%. The meme token on the BNB Chain saw its market capitalization leap from a paltry number to a stunning $40 million in a few hours, with trading volume going through the roof and quite a few folks looking askance at this seemingly obvious attempt at market manipulation. $mubarak Hits $40M Market Cap, Leads BNB Chain in Trading Volume! According to @angrybotX , $mubarak has surged to a $40M market cap, with a 24H trading volume of $38M, solidifying its position as the top-traded token on BNB Chain! #BNBchain #mubarak https://t.co/5kIui5sOWA pic.twitter.com/NyDAzmFkWp — Followin (@followin_io) March 15, 2025 The Spark That Ignited $MUBARAK’s Meteoric Rise It all began when CZ posted a seemingly innocuous tweet on Binance Square: “Going to meet a friend this weekend,” along with a meme that referenced $MUBARAK. While this tweet appeared to bear no ill intentions and to be lighthearted, it was enough to send the crypto community itself into shock and uproar. Within mere hours of the posting, the price of $MUBARAK began a rapid ascent, which, in the nearly 14 years of my being in this space, I have not seen the likes of. By the end of the first day, the price of $MUBARAK had blasted off, rising some 400%. This is an impressive feat in any world, but especially in the highly speculative domain of cryptocurrencies. CZ's Post Sends $MUBARAK Soaring 400% Binance founder @cz_binance posted “Going to meet a friend this weekend” along with a #Mubarak meme on Binance Square. Following the post, $Mubarak on BNB Chain skyrocketed 400%, reaching a $22M market cap! #mubarak #CZ pic.twitter.com/vFC7dKeM8c — Followin (@followin_io) March 15, 2025 For many, the post appeared to be an offhand comment, but in the fast-paced world of crypto, even the smallest hint from an influential figure such as CZ can set off a huge market reaction. The meme seemed to strike a chord with followers, who took it as a kind of signal or endorsement of the obscure token, and this was seen to lead to a mad dash of buying activity. As a result, or maybe in sync with the buy orders, $MUBARAK’s market capitalization leaped to what by any measure reads as a staggering $22 million, before continuing to reach an even more impressive $40 million. What this surge really makes notable is the fact that it was driven almost wholly by social media and community sentiment. As the token went meme mode, more traders piled into the thing, pushing $MUBARAK to the forefront of the BNB Chain ecosystem. You can see this clearly in the trading volume. As of this writing, not only is the price of $MUBARAK soaring, but so too is trading volume. And guess what: $MUBARAK is leading the pack in terms of actual activity on the BNB Chain. $MUBARAK Becomes a Market Leader As stated by @angrybotX, a trustworthy provider of crypto market analysis, $MUBARAK’s stunning ascent has taken it to a $40 million market capitalization, with a truly phenomenal 24-hour trading volume of $38 million. This has rightly made the token a focal point for traders, as it is now the top-traded asset on the BNB Chain. The market’s continued reaction to the rapid increase in the value of $MUBARAK has seen the token’s user base and trading community swell. This sudden growth has stoked the fires of various social media platforms, where crypto enthusiasts are engaging in speculation about whether this is a momentary blip or a sign of something more meaningful. It’s not unprecedented for a cryptocurrency to be inspired by a meme and experience a rally, but the rapidity and force of the price movement have left many people astonished. $MUBARAK’s rise to prominence also indicates the sway that influential figures like CZ have in the crypto space. CZ’s post has been much talked about, with a lot of people in the crypto community taking it as a not-so-subtle endorsement (or at least joke) that people could latch onto. This connects to the really deep association between social media, online culture, and the cryptocurrency market, where even a meme or a casual mention from a high-profile figure can lead to real-world market effects. The Role of Memes in Crypto Culture Meme culture has become a driver for much of the cryptocurrency world. Million-dollar virtual currencies are sometimes created from memes such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, which often gain traction through the engagement of communities of investors. But as a new study from Cision found, cryptocurrencies that are based on memes are more likely to be scams than serious projects. For numerous investors, the attraction of meme coins lies in their potential for massive returns, driven by the market momentum and viral trends they create. Still, this kind of trading is not without its dangers. The market for tokens built on memes is a highly speculative one, where, yes, you might make some fast money, but just as likely, you could get burned. With the $MUBARAK meme coin, the question now is whether its price can hold on to the big gains it’s made or whether it, like most memes, will just burn out. Right now, $MUBARAK is definitely in the spotlight, and its price just keeps going up after CZ’s post. The token has everyone trading, investing in, or meme-ing it, and riding the wave of its meteoric rise. Whether this is a flash in the pan or the start of something more robust, you have to give it up for $MUBARAK as it currently occupies a hallowed space in the pantheon of BNB Chain tokens. To sum up, $MUBARAK is on the scene and it’s a force to be reckoned with. Just as Tie-Dye CZ highlighted in his recent meme post, the sheer power that social media—and by extension, influential figures like CZ—wield over the crypto markets is nothing to trifle with. Of course, this is something we’ve seen time and time again in this industry. A meme coin can’t really be a top performer unless the crypto community is actively engaging with it and holding it up as the next big thing—basically unless it’s become a running joke that everyone is in on.

Analysts at Matrixport noted that the shift in sentiment that began in the summer of 2023, when gold broke above $2,000, has boosted the outlook for Bitcoin since it has increasingly been seen as a form of “digital gold,” a narrative popularized by investment giant firm BlackRock . “Regardless of the prevailing narrative, both gold and Bitcoin are poised to grow in importance as alternative assets gain momentum.

The mid-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $794 million and a 24-hour average trading volume of around $239 million, pumped more than 16 percent in the last 24 hours to trade around $2.16 on Monday, March 17, during the mid-European session. Top Reasons Why CAKE Price Surged Today The notable rise of CAKE price in the past 24 hours is majorly attributed to the rising on-chain activity of the PancakeSwap DEX. In the past 24 hours, PancakeSwap was the leading DEX by the overall volume traded of about $1.24 billion. In comparison, Solana’s Raydium recorded a 24-hour volume of about $418 million while Ethereum’s Uniswap (UNI) recorded a net daily volume of about $1 billion. As Coinpedia mentioned, the notable demand for the Mubarak (MUBARAK) memecoin has helped increase the overall on-chain activity on the PancakeSwap DEX. Moreover, MUBARAK price has surged over 2000 percent in the past four days to trade at about $0.13 at the time of this writing. According to market data from Defillama, PancakeSwap DEX has seen its total value locked (TVL) surge to about $1.62 billion. With over $160 million in staked CAKE, PancakeSwap has grown to a reputable DeFi platform. PancakeSwap Price Forecast From a technical analysis standpoint, CAKE price has been forming a macro market reversal pattern in the past year. The reversal pattern is characterized by a potential inverted head and shoulders (H&S) formation, coupled with a bullish divergence of the weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI). The altcoin has established a robust support level above $1.55, which has been confirmed after a consistent close above in the past two weeks. In case of bullish sentiment ahead, CAKE’s price is aiming for $5 in the near term, which coincides with the 1.618 daily Fibonacci Extension.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,CAKE|TRADING|ALTCOIN|MARKET|UNI,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-17 08:04:29

On March 14, 2025, that direction was clear: we were heading away from memecoins . For the day, there was a net outflow across the memecoin market of about $10,000, which was not huge but was certainly significant for a market that had been gith bushed directionally. There was a slight issue in that certain tokens wit; a net outflow was mitigated by inflows into those specific tokens. The Day’s Market Movements: A Closer Look Data from March 14 shows overall market activity was relatively calm, with a total volume of $2.89 million. Despite this moderate volume, the key takeaway was the slight imbalance in inflows and outflows. Total inflows were $1.44 million, while total outflows were $1.45 million. So we were very, very slightly net negative on that front. The net drop in volume wasn’t even enough to make it into the next paragraph — a drop of $10,000, to be precise. Although the small net loss would not appear to suggest that market conditions are dire, it does demand a moment of caution. A market that sees more outflows than inflows, even by a small margin, must indicate some loss of confidence in certain tokens or the overall market. But no market is in turmoil when it sees a reasonably orderly expression of the kind previously mentioned—rather, this might just be a sign that some investors are reallocating their portfolios and moving down the risk curve. Key Inflows: Investors Find Value in Select Tokens There were some tokens that managed to garner inflows despite the overall trend of outflows. This shows that certain memecoins are managing to capture attention from investors. The tokens that saw the most positive inflow were $WBTC, $JTO, and $GIGA. – $WBTC (Wrapped Bitcoin) recorded a strong inflow of $82K, demonstrating that there are indeed some investors who seem to be interested in gaining exposure to the larger Bitcoin ecosystem. However, these investors are choosing to enter the ecosystem through a “wrapped” form that allows them to use Bitcoin on the Ethereum network or other smart contract blockchains. For many traders, the workarounds that wrapped tokens provide make them increasingly popular options, as they allow the trader to retain the asset they really want exposure to while also participating in a conveniently accessible trading environment. One of the largest inflows was experienced by $JTO, which had $170K added to its coffers. This might reflect the growing interest in the token’s unique positioning in the memecoin space. The relative newcomer status of $JTO could be playing a role, too, as traders look for under-the-radar tokens with the potential for significant upside. – The inflows for $GIGA and $GFM were $53K and $43K, respectively. These figures may suggest that there is still some optimism around memecoins with innovative features or strong community backing. While I don’t think the smaller inflows to these tokens really indicate m ass adoption, I do think they show that some investors still see value in the niche assets that comprise the memecoin market. – $BONK, a well-known name in the memecoin sphere, received an inflow of $90K. Although many memecoins are surrounded by intense volatility, $BONK’s presence in the memecoin space seems as solid as ever, allowing it to allure that $90K inflow. One could look to other memecoins for signs of how volatile they can get, but it seems $BONK is slightly more stable than many potential counterparts. The Outflows: Investors Abandon Riskier Tokens Even though a few tokens managed to draw in some capital, there were others that experienced substantial outflows. This illustrates investor caution—or possibly even some disenchantment—with particular memecoins. Among those memecoins suffering the greatest outflows were: – $POPCAT, with a sharp outflow of $149K. It is now the meme-driven viral popularity of $POPCAT that seems like it is slowly fading away. The traders who have invested in $POPCAT seem to have switched their strategies; they appear to be selling $POPCAT off. A fire sale has been announced. $POPCAT looks like it was a one-hit wonder. Trading in $POPCAT seems to have dropped off dramatically. – $PIPPIN, another memecoin with fluctuating popularity, experienced $67K in outflows. Investors may have pulled their funds from $PIPPIN because they were concerned about its long-term sustainability or because they were simply shifting their market preferences. – A significant outflow of $127K from $FWOG took place. The outflow from this token could be part of a larger shift where investors are becoming more risk-averse regarding tokens that don’t appear to have strong fundamentals or market leadership. – $FAT, which is down $108K, also saw a notable exodus of funds. As with other tokens that are seeing outflows, this could suggest a risk-averse movement among investors, moving out of certain meme-driven projects and into what they perceive to be more stable or newer opportunities. The less conventional token #FARTCOIN experienced outflows of $148K. Its meme-based nature may have attracted many traders, but the lack of any long-term, serious value likely had investors bailing on this humorously named cryptocurrency. Recap: Smart money on chain activities in the memecoin market for 14/03/25 Yesterday, there was more outflow than inflow Inflow: $1.44M Outflow: $1.45M Volume: $2.89M Net Volume: -$10k There was inflow into: $WBTC ($82K) $JTO ($170K) $GIGA ($53K) $GFM ($43K) $BONK ($90K)… pic.twitter.com/0lCpQkVo57 — Stalkchain (@StalkHQ) March 15, 2025 Investor Sentiment and Market Outlook The net outflow of $10,000 on March 14, 2025, while relatively small, reflects a broader sentiment of caution. Investors appear to be pulling back from riskier positions, favoring more stable assets, at least for the time being. This newfound caution of investors may spring from several wells: recent market turbulence, a shift in sentiment among traders, or simply the natural ebb and flow of investor interest in high-risk assets like memecoins. Inflow into tokens such as $WBTC, $JTO, and $BONK shows that some parts of the memecoin market still attract investment. But outflows from tokens like $POPCAT and $PIPPIN raise questions about the future of certain memecoins, suggesting that the speculative bubble surrounding them may be deflating. The memecoin market could be at a consolidation stage, now only the most resilient and well-supported memecoins amass considerable interest among traders and investors. Outlook: Traders and investors scanning the horizon for the next big, meme-driven rally should probably keep their heads down and work under a caution flag for now. On the whole, memecoin investors might have viewed March 14, 2025, with some disappointment, as the memecoin market was among the crypto sectors that experienced net outflows on that day. Yet there were still pockets of interest and even some cheerfulness among certain memecoins. Tokens like $WBTC and $JTO, for instance, exhibited noticeable growth on March 14, suggesting that not all was lost for the memecoin market that day.

SOL/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/ TradingView The top reasons driving the SOL prices lower today include: Decreasing investor interest in SOL’s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Decreasing open interest and negative funding rates. Technicals suggest a possible further drop in SOL price. Solana TVL hits four-month lows SOL’s price drop today is preceded by a drop in the total value locked (TVL) in its DeFi applications, as per data from DefiLlama. Key points: Solana’s TVL has been in a downtrend since mid-January. This metric fell by 45.5% from $12.1 billion on Jan. 19 to $6.63 billion on March 11. The TVL now stands at $7 billion on March 17, 41% below the Jan. 19 peak. Solana total value locked. Source: DefiLlama This drop in TVL occurred in tandem with the decrease in SOL’s price, which is down 56% over the same period. Several layer-2 protocols, such as Jito and Raydium, have posted 30% and 32% drops in TVL over the last 30 days. The declining TVL reflects traders’ waning interest and could be a sign that Solana struggles to attract new users despite its lower traction costs. Solana’s price slump is also supported by a decline in onchain activity within the Solana ecosystem , according to the data provided by Dune dashboard Pump.fun . What to know: A sharp drop in the number of network transactions preceded SOL’s price drop on March 17. The amount of daily transactions on the Solana blockchain has dropped from an all-time high of 71,738 on Jan. 23 to 24.505 on March 17, as shown in the chart below. Solana’s deployed transactions performance chart. Source: Pump.Fun This indicates decreasing network activity, resulting in lower revenues from fees. This negatively affects SOL’s price, partially explaining the ongoing correction. Solana funding rates remain negative Solana's open interest (OI) is decreasing, and its funding rates are negative, which provides insight into why SOL’s price is struggling. Key points: Solana’s OI in the futures market has dripped from its local peak of $8.57 billion on Jan. 17 to $4.03 billion as of March 17. OI measures the total number of outstanding futures contracts, and a decrease suggests more traders are exiting positions. SOL futures open interest.

SOL’s weekly funding rates remain negative at -0.10% on March 17, four months after peaking out at 1.37%. SOL OI-Weighted Funding Rate. Source: CoinGlass Negative funding means shorts are paying longs to keep their positions open. OI decline and negative funding rates show a lack of confidence in SOL’s short-term price action. Related: Solana’s 5th birthday: From pandemic origins to US crypto stockpile SOL price could drop another 35% SOL trades 56% below its all-time high of around $294, established on Jan. 19, and chart technicals suggest that there’s more room for the downside over the next few weeks. Key levels to watch: The altcoin has been trading above the $120 level, but the bulls have failed to push the price above $135. If the price slides below $120, the SOL/USDT pair could drop to the $110 range low (established on Aug. 5, 2025). This is a critical support to watch out for because a break and close below it may start a downward move to $100 and then to $80. Such a move would represent a 35% drop from the current price.

A break and close above the $140 psychological level will suggest that the selling pressure is reducing. The pair could rally to the 50-day simple moving average at $171, where the bears are expected to mount a strong defense. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

41798070,https://nulltx.com/?p=147173,1742198929,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Smart Money Wallets Favor Specific Narratives: Kanye West, AI, and DeFi Dominate Accumulations",https://nulltx.com/smart-money-wallets-favor-specific-narratives-kanye-west-ai-and-defi-dominate-accumulations/,"In the constantly changing realm of cryptocurrency , the revenues of intelligent money purses often bestow priceless little searchlights on where the market is headed. The last 24 hours have seen the concentration on three future narratives: Kanye West’s L influence on meme coins, AI and agentic frameworks, and burgeoning interest in DeFi innovations. The market’s reaction to these developing trends has seen certain tokens react positively, especially after seeing smart money merge with some impressive celebrity endorsements and cutting-edge technologies. Accumulation Trends: Meme Coins, AI, and DeFi Lead the Charge A wide variety of tokens has attracted the interest of astute investors. One of the most notable developments is the sizable investments being made in meme coins—such as those associated with Kanye West. Another key narrative is the development of frameworks for artificial intelligence, which seems to promise a new generation of robust decentralized applications. Finally, there is a burgeoning area of interest in truly decentralized finance platforms, which are primitive to what many call today an “innovative financial system.” These three storylines are driving the strategies of large investors, whose activity is increasingly important to the cryptocurrency markets. Kanye West and Meme Coins: $YZY Leads the Way In recent days, one of the standout trends seems to be the surge of interest in Kanye West’s involvement in the crypto space, particularly in meme coins. Known for his pop culture influence, Kanye West’s endorsement, whether intentional or not, has driven a ton of eyeballs toward the tokens allegedly linked to him. One such token is $YZY. Over the past 24 hours, four smart money wallets have scooped up over $22,000 of $YZY. The market cap of the token is currently $22.49 million. No one really knows (or cares) how a meme coin tied to Kanye West came to be, but it’s safe to say it has something to do with the rapper’s colossal presence on social media and the sheer association of his name with buzzworthy tokens. AI and Agentic Frameworks: $MAIAR Sparks Development Interest A different accumulation trend has developed around AI projects. In contrast to general layer 1 and layer 2 projects, which we saw recently accumulating, there has been an uptick in the last few days in smart money moving into AI-powered projects. This trend has shifted significantly toward projects that we classify as agentic frameworks—systems that enable machines or algorithms to perform complex tasks without human oversight. A prime example of such a project is MAIAR ($MAIAR), which has recently announced Phase 3 of its development. Over the last 24 hours, two smart money wallets have accumulated $6,000 worth of $MAIAR, pushing the token’s market cap to $1.7 million. Smart money wallets accumulations in the last 24 hours Main specific narratives accumulated: Kanye West & Meme Coins (9 wallets) AI & Agentic Frameworks (8 wallets) DeFi & Financial Innovations (5 wallets) Top accumulations and reasoning: $YZY (Swasticoin) ->… pic.twitter.com/uE5LRa5BN6 — CoinSense.app (@CoinSense_App) March 15, 2025 DeFi Innovations: $AAVE and $BNKR Garner Smart Money Support Even as AI and meme coins attract much of the limelight, the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector remains a foundational part of the crypto market’s growth. A high-profile project that is drawing ever more interest is $AAVE, the massively popular DeFi lending platform. It’s not just retail investors who are excited about $AAVE these days; smart money, too, is taking notice. In the past 24 hours, one highly regarded crypto wallet accumulated $38,000 in $AAVE, a coin whose market cap now stands at a whopping $2.6 billion. A recent announcement from the $AAVE team about a new economic model and a buyback plan appears to have sparked fresh investor enthusiasm. $BNKR (BankrCoin), in the domain of artificial intelligence and decentralized finance, has thrown out more than its share of ripples. $BNKR’s token is capturing what uninitiated observers might consider its “brain power” — the crypto companion powered by AI, designed to turbocharge DeFi. A smart money wallet just picked up $11,000 worth of $BNKR, which now has a market cap of $22.4 million. The combination of AI and DeFi seems on its surface to be a potent cocktail, proof of which is the $BNKR narrative. Unique and Niche Projects: $GFM and $PVS Catch Investor Interest In addition to the main stories about Kanye West, DeFi, and AI, some more obscure projects are also drawing the interest of smart money wallets and attracting investors’ attention. $GFM (GoFundMeme), a community-driven project with a focus on meme tokens, has racked up some recent interest. One smart money wallet added $14,000 to its holdings of $GFM, which now has a market cap of $16.7 million. The project’s focus on community incentives and the transparency of its fair launch have made it a standout in the crowded market for meme coins. Currently, $PVS is a blip on the radar of most crypto investors, with a relatively small market cap of $3.3 million. Most of its trading volume so far has come from centralized exchange CEX.IO, where $PVS is priced at $0.00397 as of midday September 28. However, that trading volume is dramatically up from where it was this time last week, when the price of $PVS was roughly $0.0016. Over the past 24 hours prior to this writeup, $PVS had a total trading volume of $308,840. Over the same timeframe, its price has climbed from $0.0035 to where $PVS now sits at midday on September 28. Conclusion: Smart Money Navigates Emerging Trends In the previous 24 hours, smart money wallets have been accumulating a different assortment of tokens—a bandwagon effect that seems to underlie the current cryptocurrency trends. The latest additions to the wallets have been meme coins. They also contain tokens tied to AI projects, and some are stashing DeFi-related coins. It appears that the investors who these wallets represent are now banking on the idea that certain narratives (or stories) are going to drive the prices of these tokens higher in the near future. As these sectors keep developing, it’s going to be intriguing to witness their evolution and to discern which kinds of projects will endure. At present, though, investors are evidently putting their bets on meme-driven momentum, groundbreaking AI advancements, and the potential for financial innovation in DeFi. Whether these bets will pan out or be smacked down by the kind of market volatility that everyone in the crypto space has come to know and love remains to be seen.

The exchange decided to suspend the DEX aggregator while it works on upgrades to prevent further issues, following consultations with regulators. OKX Pauses DEX Aggregator for Internal Review and Upgrades OKX confirmed the suspension is for an internal review and upgrade but it did not specify when it would end. Crypto wallet services are still available to the customers, but new wallet creation will be paused in some markets during this time. “We are temporarily pausing our DEX aggregator to address incomplete tagging on blockchain explorers while we also roll out new security features. This is to address the recent coordinated attacks by media along with unsuccessful efforts by Lazarus group to misuse our DeFi services,” it noted. On March 11, Bloomberg reported that EU financial regulators were investigating OKX’s DEX aggregator, OKX Web3, and its wallet services for allegedly laundering funds from the Bybit hack. In response, OKX said that it had been the target of media attacks questioning its integrity. The exchange added that these attacks are happening at a time when they are actively fighting against financial crime. OKX Denies Allegations Bybit’s CEO, Ben Zhou, claimed nearly $100 million of the $1.5 billion stolen in the hack was funneled through OKX’s Web3 service, with some funds now untraceable. However, OKX denied the allegations, calling the report misleading. The exchange explained that, when the Bybit hack occurred, it froze any associated funds from moving to its centralized exchange (CEX) and worked on new hack detection features. OKX Launches Hacker Detection System OKX stated that its goal is to ensure that explorers correctly identify trades processed by the DEX, instead of mistakenly linking them to its aggregator. The exchange has introduced a “hacker address detection system” for its DEX aggregator and can track and block hacker addresses in real time on its centralized exchange. OKX CEO Star Xu emphasized that they have implemented several controls, including IP blocking for certain markets and real-time black address detection. OKX also clarified that the OKX Web3 DEX aggregator is not a custodian of customer assets, and its function is to provide access to liquidity across multiple protocols. However it noted that some have deliberately misrepresented its platform.",News|Crypto news|Hack,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-17 08:11:09

Speculation is growing that this investor may have inside information about the US President Donald Trump. Meanwhile, a group of traders is reportedly working together to push BTC price high enough to trigger the liquidation, turning this into a major crypto showdown. Bitcoin Whale Faces Liquidation Woes According to market expert Gordon, a whale has doubled down on a massive Bitcoin short. Initially, the investor placed a 40x leverage bet worth $380 million. However, after adding to the position, their new liquidation price stands at $86,593. “There seems to be a group of whales trying to pump BTC to liquidate him.” Gordon wrote in a post on X . The move suggests coordinated action among traders, a rare but not unheard-of event in the crypto world. Notably, a latest report from CoinGape also showed that BTC might continue its rally amid rising whale activity. Trump Insider Link Fuels Speculation Adding to discussions, the whale is rumored to have insider knowledge about US President Donald Trump. According to an update from Ash Crypto, this investor allegedly placed their short position based on confidential information. Ash Crypto wrote: “Trump insider whale who opened a $380 million bitcoin short with 40x is being hunted publicly on “ X ” by a group of people who are trying to liquidate him at $86,600.” If the speculation holds true, it raises questions about whether political developments could influence Bitcoin’s future price movements. Trump’s stance on cryptocurrency has shifted over time, making any connection between him and the whale’s move a subject of intense debate. Besides, the announcement of the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve in the US has further fueled speculations in the market. Liquidity Providers Enter the Game In a striking development, liquidity provider CBB also weighed in on the unfolding drama. In a recent X post, the account stated: “If you are willing to hunt this dude with size, drop a DM, setting up a team right now and already got good size.” Shortly after, CBB followed up with a cryptic message: “The hunt has begun.” This statement suggests a coordinated effort is now underway to force Bitcoin’s price up and trigger the whale’s liquidation. If successful, it could lead to a sudden price surge and increased market volatility. Bitcoin Price & Performance BTC price today was down around 1% and exchanged hands at $83K, while its one-day volume rocketed 93% to $24 billion. The crypto has touched a 24-hour high and low of $85,051.60 and $82,017.90, respectively. Despite the current loss, the flagship crypto has recorded gains of more than 1% in the last seven days. Meanwhile, amid the gloomy performance, a report showed that BTC price might crash to $20K if the US stock market enters a “BEAR MARKET”, which has further escalated tensions. Having said that, investors are keeping close track of the latest BTC movements, with soaring speculations over potential insider trading in the market.

41798220,https://nulltx.com/?p=147172,1742199186,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Non-Wholecoiners Show Their Paper Hands as Bitcoin Market Trends Shift,https://nulltx.com/non-wholecoiners-show-their-paper-hands-as-bitcoin-market-trends-shift/,"The cryptocurrency world is undergoing change, and a shift is noticeable among non-wholecoiners—those who’ve not quite reached the 1 Bitcoin mark. Entities and individual holders of Bitcoin less than 1 BTC have been offloading it. Meanwhile, it seems that the playing field—the market cap landscape—is becoming less retail and more institutional. This retail-to-institutional evolution isn’t something new, as it’s something we’ve seen before. The enthusiasm seen in late 2020 with the influx of retail investors has now subsided, and Bitcoin remains less of an everyday topic. Despite the recent waning enthusiasm, these larger institutional players are still in acquisition mode, amassing enormous amounts of Bitcoin. A Familiar Pattern Emerges in the Current Cycle The market behaves in a certain way with non-wholecoiners, and it’s a way we’ve seen before. In the last cycle, when Bitcoin was hitting its all-time high of $40,000, we were watching a similar trend where smaller holders were offloading their BTC. At that time, non-wholecoiners (or, as I like to call them, “the not-so-elite club” of Bitcoin holders) sold off not an insignificant amount of Bitcoin (roughly 0.07 million, if you’re counting). Of course, this produced a wave of market activity that the smooth operators in the Bitcoin price discovery mechanism would rather avoid. In the next section, we’ll look at why non-wholecoiners feel compelled to sell when they do. Fast forward to today, and this behavior seems to be repeating itself. As Bitcoin climbs once again, those who own less than 1 BTC are increasingly liquidating their holdings. These smaller holders appear to be responding to Bitcoin’s price surges by either cashing out for profits or becoming more risk-averse. However, it is important to note that this trend does not necessarily signal a decline in overall market confidence. In fact, despite the offloading of Bitcoin by these retail investors, Bitcoin holdings from retail users have actually grown by 37% since 2020. Currently, retail investors collectively hold around 1.75 million BTC, a significant increase from previous years. Non-Wholecoiners show their paper hands As companies and governments continue to accumulate #Bitcoin , non-wholecoiners holding less than 1 $BTC are gradually reducing their holdings, mirroring the trend seen in late 2020. In the previous cycle, when $BTC surged to $40K,… pic.twitter.com/J77Hf4YHYu — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) March 14, 2025 Institutional Accumulation Continues to Drive Market Dynamics Institutional investors and large financial players are still bullish on bitcoin, and they keep adding to their positions. Meanwhile, smaller bitcoin holders are now reducing their exposure. Entities both public and private are coming to see bitcoin as more than just a store of value: they’re increasingly viewing it as an inflation-hedge and a way to navigate uncertain economic waters. The latest manifestation of this bitcoin bull market? According to some analysts, it’s the bitcoin ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) that have been roaring out of the gate. New data emphasize the meaningful net outflows from Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). An estimated $153.11 million in losses over the past few months can be attributed to a total outflow of 1,818 BTC from these funds. The major force behind these outflows is a handful of large institutional players. Fidelity, for example, has seen an outflow of 939 BTC, valued at about $79.05 million. Despite this, however, the company still has in its custody a very impressive 194,270 BTC. This amounts to an approximate $16.36 billion commitment to holding Bitcoin. Mar 14 Update: 10 #Bitcoin ETFs NetFlow: -1,818 $BTC (-$153.11M) #Fidelity outflows 939 $BTC ($79.05M) and currently holds 194,270 $BTC ($16.36B). 9 #Ethereum ETFs NetFlow: -17,187 $ETH (-$33.24M) #iShares (Blackrock) outflows 8,175 $ETH ($15.81M) and currently holds 1,248,688… pic.twitter.com/RNfE43PmpU — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) March 14, 2025 The trend of Bitcoin institutional investment remains undoubted. Companies and investment firms continue to buy into Bitcoin, not only as an asset for capital appreciation but as a hedge against economic turmoil and inflationary pressures. This consistent demand from much larger players helps support the much broader Bitcoin ecosystem and could be the principal driver behind its long-term growth. Bitcoin’s Role in the Broader Financial Landscape Retail and institutional investors interact in complex ways, and the cryptocurrency Bitcoin is a prime example of this. We see that most of the early adopters of Bitcoin weren’t wholecoiners; they were just like you, me, and our listeners, holding a fraction of a Bitcoin (or less). Many of these non-wholecoiners have (or are in the process of) parting ways with the asset, seemingly due to the high levels of volatility that Bitcoin has exhibited over the past year. Now, in stark contrast, institutional buyers are embracing Bitcoin and taking a longer-term view, and this is super important to understand. Although smaller retail investors might withdraw from the market or cash in their profits, Bitcoin looks as if it’s building an uptrend—maybe even a bull market. Institutions and governments that seem to have little interest in ever selling are now holding onto remarkable amounts of BTC. At the same time, this is not a retail-driven market. Even if the retail side of the Bitcoin market falls, it hardly seems as if the Bitcoin price is in decadence. To conclude, Bitcoin’s marketplace is in a state of constant flux, shaped by the actions of retail and institutional investors alike. The non-wholecoiners’ tendency to sell off their holdings during market rallies is a trend that continues to emerge, one that, in many ways, seems to have been modeled off of the pattern we witnessed in late 2020. Of course, as we know, the past is not always prologue. That said, after you take a snapshot of the Bitcoin price action that occurred last week (i.e., the week of March 1, 2021) and overlay it with the price action that occurred in the last week of February 2021, the beginning of March 2021, and the first half of the second week of March 2021.

The latest analysis has shown that the most significant support level for Ethereum at present is $1,870, while its stoutest resistance level is $2,050. With market moves and whale activity greatly influencing the price of Ethereum, these key levels will be important to monitor as the asset attempts to navigate through its next phase. #Ethereum $ETH key levels to watch! On-chain data reveals $1,870 as the strongest support and $2,050 as its toughest resistance! pic.twitter.com/IBjUmQIjqU — Ali (@ali_charts) March 14, 2025 Whale Activity and Institutional Movements In the past five days, Ethereum has experienced huge buying activity from whales—big investors or entities that can actually move the market. In this short time, they have purchased over 420,000 ETH, which strongly indicates an accumulation phase. Now, this surge in whale buying would suggest, and is being taken, as a larger narrative of confidence being instilled in Ethereum by its bigger investors, who see it as a quasi-stable asset. Their purchases reflect, but also provide, confidence at some allegedly key support levels around $1,870, which might allow it, and not only it, but also its bigger holders, to avoid looking at new lows and consolidation before what could be taking it towards new highs. The influence of institutional investors has played a major role in shaping Ethereum’s market price. Whales aren’t the only ones moving the needle. Ethereum ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) are increasingly becoming a significant way for institutions and high-net-worth individuals to gain exposure to Ethereum without having to purchase, hold, or properly manage the asset themselves. However, recent data shows that Ethereum ETFs have seen a noticeable decline in net inflows. In fact, it’s not just net inflows that have been going in the wrong direction; recent data also show that net outflows have occurred. In total, the last reported net outflow was approximately 17,000 ETH (or about $33.24 million). Mar 14 Update: 10 #Bitcoin ETFs NetFlow: -1,818 $BTC (-$153.11M) #Fidelity outflows 939 $BTC ($79.05M) and currently holds 194,270 $BTC ($16.36B). 9 #Ethereum ETFs NetFlow: -17,187 $ETH (-$33.24M) #iShares (Blackrock) outflows 8,175 $ETH ($15.81M) and currently holds 1,248,688… pic.twitter.com/RNfE43PmpU — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) March 14, 2025 One of the primary contributors to the recent outflows has been iShares, a division of the investment giant BlackRock. Over the past few days, iShares has withdrawn 8,175 ETH, worth approximately $15.81 million. While this might seem like a concerning development at first glance, iShares still holds a very substantial position in Ethereum, with over 1.24 million ETH, or $2.41 billion at current market prices. This very substantial holding reflects BlackRock’s continued confidence in Ethereum’s potential, even as some assets are liquidated. Support and Resistance: Crucial Levels to Watch In this unstable atmosphere, the price of Ethereum is oscillating, and two essential price points are coming to the forefront: $1,870 as the main support and $2,050 as the resistance ceiling. The area around $1,870 has proven to be a robust support level. On-chain data confirms this as the price level where demand is likely to kick in and prevent Ethereum from correcting any more deeply. If prices dip toward that level, they present a pretty good buying opportunity for anyone looking to enter the Ethereum market at comparatively lower prices. If, however, prices were to break below that level, one would have to interpret that on-chain demand had failed and that further bearish momentum could be expected. Conversely, the $2,050 resistance stands as a formidable barrier for Ethereum to breach. This price level has served as a cap, restricting price increases on several occasions. For Ethereum to push past this resistance level, it probably needs to have continued astoundingly bullish price action. If Ethereum were to overcome the $2,050 strong resistance and hold up above that price level, it might just be the new catalyst to trigger a wave of buying that would push the price of the asset much higher and reestablish an upward trajectory. The Future of Ethereum Amid Changing Market Conditions Even with the recently seen outflows from Ethereum ETFs, the much bigger picture for Ethereum is an optimistic one. Institutional players are now involved in Ethereum, and those “whale” investors who tend to accumulate and hold large amounts of Ethereum are still doing so. So, these two groups certainly seem to convey Ethereum’s recent long-term strength. Ethereum’s ongoing transition to Ethereum 2.0 and the wider Layer 2 adoption not only fortify its standing as a leading blockchain platform but increasingly enable it to realize another aspect of its promise: a potential to be a mainstay in the cryptocurrency space. To sum up, even though we cannot avoid short-term volatility, the present market forces seem to confer a level of support at about $1,870 and a level of resistance at about $2,050 that Ethereum is struggling with. Whale activity continues to be dominant. Institutional players appear to be quite comfortable holding these assets, and with the price largely oscillating between these two levels, I would maintain that things seem to be going okay in terms of the overall health of the Ethereum asset and its market.

XRP’s dominance in blockchain payments is facing fresh competition as Remittix gains attention for its fee-free, real-time transactions. Table of Contents Will 2025 be XRP’s breakout year? Why investors are looking at Remittix as a contender Could Remittix overtake XRP in market growth? Which token holds the most long-term potential? Conclusion XRP remains arguably the most talked-about cryptocurrency with a number of analysts predicting a potential breakthrough in 2025. Despite XRP having been at the vanguard of blockchain-based payments for decades now, competition is building and contenders are emerging in the payments sector. Some of such emerging projects include Remittix (RTX), designed for fee-free, near-instant crypto-fiat payments. With XRP likely to receive a potential boost, multiple investors have started questioning: Will Remittix shockingly take center stage in 2025? Will 2025 be XRP’s breakout year? XRP currently trades at $2.30 and lost 5.09% in the last 24 hours. Despite the loss, XRP remains one of the strongest currencies with a market cap of $134.19 billion. Trading volume for XRP dropped 30.09% to $3.24 billion, and this signals some hesitation on the investor’s side. It would take much greater institutional adoption and regulatory clarity for XRP to go parabolic in 2025. Many investors believe XRP’s integration into global banking systems could bring immense demand and bring its value to all-time highs again. Though XRP remains a household name in cryptocurrency payments, newer entrants like Remittix are proving that blockchain-based payment innovation is far from over. Why investors are looking at Remittix as a contender Remittix is also emerging as a next-gen cryptocurrency payment system with fee-free and real-time conversion of currencies into fiat currencies. At $0.0734 per token, RTX raised nearly $13.9 million and sold 520 million tokens in evidence of strong early adoption. Compared to XRP for institutional finance, RTX targets individuals and companies and enables fast and smooth transfers with no banking intermediaries. For instance, an Asian freelancer servicing US-based clients can use RTX to receive payments in real time and avoid delayed bank processing. Since it streamlines cross-border payments, the majority of investors believe it could easily become the next major competitor to XRP in blockchain finance.

XRP has been a power to be reckoned with as a payment in the digital space but overdependence on regulatory approval and institutional endorsement has damped its adoption. RTX, by contrast, is quickly picking up users due to real-world use cases in payment. Since it offers crypto-to-fiat payment solutions, RTX is attracting business owners, freelancers, and retailers looking for a quicker and cheaper payment processing option. With the rise in demand for non-traditional banking services, analysts feel that in 2025, RTX could outshine XRP in percentage appreciation. Compared to XRP, which has existed for years now, RTX is in its infancy in regard to development and thus holds a much higher upside in regard to return potential. Which token holds the most long-term potential? As XRP and RTX battle for payment dominance, investors are considering their longer-term prospects. XRP remains a strong contender for bank access at the institutional level, but overhanging regulatory risk remains a concern. In the meantime, Remittix is targeting real-world use cases, making it increasingly accessible to the everyday user and placing it as a very viable contender in the cryptocurrency arena as it grows further. With growing crypto adoption, RTX is viewed by the majority of investors as a more suitable choice for real-world payments. As it is designed for fee-less transactions, it arrives with growing demand, thereby positioning itself as a better choice. While XRP continues to retain institutional appeal, RTX’s focus on usability and accessibility makes it more competitive, particularly for individuals and businesses seeking low-cost, efficient payment solutions. Conclusion As XRP sets up for its potential 2025 rally, so are investors looking at RTX as a rising star in blockchain finance. With its low transactional costs, fast payouts, and increasing adoption, RTX is fast emerging as a game-changer. Although XRP’s chances at reaching new highs still appear promising, Remittix looks increasingly likely to be a strong player in the blockchain payments market. With investors seeking alternatives with practical, real-world financial solutions, RTX is quickly emerging as one of the most promising crypto projects to watch in 2025.
