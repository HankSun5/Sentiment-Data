41773764,https://coinpaprika.com/news/libra-creator-hayden-davis-linked-to-wolf-token-amid-new-controversy,1742160476,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/41773764.jpeg,LIBRA Creator Hayden Davis Linked to WOLF Token Amid New Controversy,https://coinpaprika.com/news/libra-creator-hayden-davis-linked-to-wolf-token-amid-new-controversy,"Hayden Davis, the controversial creator of the LIBRA meme coin, has been linked to a new token called WOLF , which shares similarities with his past projects. Blockchain analysis from Bubblemaps revealed that 82% of WOLF’s supply was controlled by a small group of wallets, fueling suspicions of insider manipulation. This development comes as Argentine authorities continue investigating Davis for his involvement in the LIBRA scandal. Davis launched WOLF around the time that Jordan Belfort, the real-life ""Wolf of Wall Street,"" was rumored to be introducing a meme coin under the same name. The sudden buzz around WOLF drew attention from traders, particularly the WallStreetBets (WSB) community, sending its market cap surging to $40 million. However, just like previous Davis-related tokens, WOLF’s price plummeted soon after, with analysts suspecting a rug pull. Blockchain data indicated that the token’s supply was funneled through a web of addresses before leading back to a wallet linked to Davis. Blockchain analytics firm Bubblemaps tracked the movement of WOLF’s funds and found that they had been transferred across 17 wallets and five different blockchains before arriving at a single address identified as belonging to Davis. The similarities between WOLF and his past projects, including MELANIA and LIBRA, further reinforced suspicions of a pattern of coordinated token launches followed by price crashes. Davis has a history of controversial meme coin projects. LIBRA, one of his previous tokens, became a political scandal when Argentine President Javier Milei briefly endorsed it. This endorsement sent the token’s value skyrocketing past $4 billion before it collapsed, wiping out nearly all of its value. Blockchain analysts discovered that key insiders, who had acquired large amounts of LIBRA before Milei’s endorsement, quickly sold their holdings for over $100 million, leaving retail investors at a loss. Davis later admitted to playing a role in the LIBRA project and also confessed to launching a meme coin associated with former US First Lady Melania Trump. His involvement in multiple meme coin controversies has drawn legal attention, particularly from Argentine authorities who have launched an official investigation into the LIBRA case. The fallout from LIBRA has also led Argentine lawyer Gregorio Dalbon to call for an Interpol Red Notice against Davis, which could result in his arrest and possible extradition. Critics argue that Davis' continued involvement in the crypto space raises concerns about the lack of oversight in meme coin projects. The rapid creation of tokens, often associated with high-profile names, has become a strategy to generate market hype before an eventual collapse. These tactics have repeatedly left investors holding worthless tokens while a select few profit significantly. The growing scrutiny around Davis’ actions reflects broader concerns about the risks associated with meme coins and the need for regulatory oversight. Many traders remain drawn to the speculative nature of these projects, but the repeated pattern of sudden crashes has raised red flags within the cryptocurrency community. As legal pressure mounts, it remains unclear whether Davis will face consequences for his role in these projects. While some argue that buyers should conduct thorough research before investing in highly speculative tokens, others believe that stricter regulations are needed to prevent high-profile manipulations like the ones Davis has been accused of orchestrating. The case of WOLF serves as another example of the volatility and unpredictability of the meme coin market. While meme coins continue to attract traders looking for quick profits, the risks associated with unverified projects remain high. With authorities increasingly scrutinizing such schemes, the future of unchecked meme coin launches may be in question.",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-16 21:27:56

The streamer says she was held at gunpoint by several individuals demanding that she hand over the private keys to her crypto. According to Fox 26 , the suspects include Dylan Nesho Campbell, Bryan Anthony Salazar Guerrero and two additional suspects between the ages of 16-17. Campbell and Guerrero were each charged with aggravated kidnapping and aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon, as was the 17-year-old suspect. Siragusa reported that several armed individuals entered her home late at night on March 2, beat her, and held her at gunpoint, demanding her cryptocurrency. Source: Amouranth Luckily, her husband was on speakerphone, which the gunmen took in an attempt to access a crypto app. The husband, having been alerted to the situation, grabbed a handgun while attempting to gauge where the armed men were in the home. The online streamer led the assailants around the home and convinced them to start looking for a cold storage device. As the armed robbers were looking for the device, Siragusa ran upstairs to her husband, who was also watching the situation unfold on the home's network of cameras. Once she was safely upstairs, her husband fired off three rounds at assailants, likely shooting one in the process before the home invaders retreated and law enforcement arrived at the scene. Siragusa’s husband later revealed that he was the one posting from her account as the incident unfolded. Source: Amouranth The streamer previously disclosed that she held roughly 211 Bitcoin, worth over $20 million in November 2024, to online followers — making her a target for armed robbery.

However, volatility and uncertainty have dominated the market since the start of the month, keeping LINK’s price action unstable. Related Reading: Cardano Is ‘About To Break Free’ – Breakout Above Crucial Supply To Trigger A Big Move–Analyst The token has seen wild price swings, moving from $17 down to $13, briefly rebounding to $16, and then collapsing to a low of $11.8. Bulls are now fighting to push LINK back above the $15 mark, but momentum remains weak, and the market appears to be consolidating around current levels. Despite this uncertainty, on-chain data is showing promising signs. Metrics from Santiment reveal that 640,000 LINK were pulled off exchanges in the last 24 hours, which is typically a bullish signal. Large withdrawals from exchanges often indicate long-term accumulation, as investors move their holdings into private wallets instead of keeping them available for immediate selling. With exchange outflows rising, traders are watching closely to see if LINK can break through resistance levels and confirm a shift toward bullish momentum. The next few trading sessions will be key in determining whether LINK can recover or if further consolidation is ahead. Uncertainty Looms As Investors Watch For A Breakout Chainlink is currently holding above the $13.5 mark, struggling to reclaim higher levels as selling pressure and market uncertainty persist. Despite its recent recovery attempts, LINK remains stuck below key resistance, making investors cautious about its short-term direction. Analysts and traders are concerned about a potential drop below the current range, as on-chain metrics suggest a distribution phase may be unfolding. If LINK fails to hold its support zone, it could see renewed selling pressure, sending the price toward lower demand levels. However, not all signals are bearish. Crypto expert Ali Martinez shared Santiment data on X, revealing that 640,000 LINK were pulled off exchanges in the last 24 hours. This is often seen as a bullish indicator, as large investors typically withdraw their holdings from exchanges when they anticipate higher prices in the future. When whales and long-term holders accumulate, it reduces selling pressure on the market and strengthens price stability. If LINK manages to break key resistance levels, this accumulation trend could set the stage for a strong recovery rally.

The next few days will be critical as investors watch for a breakout or further downside movement. Chainlink Bulls Defend Key Support Levels Chainlink (LINK) is currently trading at $14, facing resistance at the $15 level as bulls struggle to reclaim higher ground. The market remains under pressure, and LINK must hold current levels to avoid a deeper correction. For a recovery rally to take shape, bulls need to defend the $13 support zone and build momentum toward a breakout above $15. If LINK successfully pushes past this resistance, the next major target is the $17 level, where it must reclaim the 200-day moving average (MA) and the exponential moving average (EMA) to confirm a bullish trend reversal. However, if LINK fails to hold its current support levels, selling pressure could intensify, driving the price toward the $10 range or even lower levels. This would put LINK in a deeper downtrend, making a short-term recovery more difficult.

The Best Meme Coins for Exponential Returns include Arctic Pablo Coin , a thrilling adventure-themed crypto, Official Melania, a politically charged meme token, and Shiba Inu, the legendary Dogecoin rival. Each of these coins brings something unique to the table, whether it’s a high-stakes presale, community-driven growth, or a strong ecosystem. Investors are eyeing these trending meme coins for their potential to deliver massive returns, making them some of the hottest opportunities in the market right now. Arctic Pablo Coin: The Best New Meme Coin for Exponential Returns on an Icy Adventure Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) isn’t just another meme coin presale ; it’s one of the Best New Meme Coins for Exponential Returns, inviting investors on an exhilarating expedition led by the intrepid explorer, Arctic Pablo. This narrative-driven cryptocurrency transforms the investment journey into a thrilling adventure, blending storytelling with financial opportunity. Unlike traditional presales divided into stages, Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale is structured around unique locations, each representing a chapter in Pablo’s quest. Currently, in its 14th location, Frosty Falls, $APC is priced at $0.000074 per token. Early investors have already raised over $1.88 million, anticipating a remarkable 10,694.59% return on investment when the coin lists at $0.008. This innovative approach not only adds excitement but also makes Arctic Pablo Coin one of the Best New Meme Coins for Exponential Returns, as each location unlocks new opportunities for investors. To enhance scarcity and value, Arctic Pablo Coin employs a deflationary mechanism by burning unsold tokens weekly during the presale. This strategy ensures that the total supply decreases over time, potentially increasing the value of remaining tokens. All burn transactions are transparently recorded on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), reinforcing trust within the community. Investors can further benefit from staking their $APC tokens, earning a generous 66% Annual Percentage Yield (APY).

But will the price cross the much anticipated $1 mark this year? This has been the main focus of much of the debate on the price these last few weeks, especially as the price showed a strong bearish hit in the last few months. However, while the price hitting $1 has seen much debate, some analysts have started speculating that Remittix might hit the $1 mark before Shiba Inu. But seeing that the Remittix token is a more recent addition to the market, could the Remittixprice growth cause it to hit $1 before a top option like the Shiba Inu? When is Shiba Inu Price Hitting $1? The Shiba Inu price has been in a negative direction since the start of this year, dropping as low as 52% in the last 90 days. This is even a fair value due to its recent growth in the last 7 days, which saw it end the week at 2.7% growth. Overall, the price outlook of the coin reflected that it has been on a bearish move for the last 4 months. However, using the recent price change, is the Shiba Inu price showing a possible price jump towards $1 soon? There was a strong bearish impact on the Shiba Inu price earlier this year due to the surge in meme coins, which has slowed the growth of the Shiba coin. But, following the slight change in direction in the last few days, the Shiba Inu daily chart shows the coin on an uptrend seen from the breakout above the 7 SMA. However, it is too early to take this growth literally to mean the price is heading toward a new high. The Shiba Inu price chart shows that there are still a couple of levels that could show strong resistance for the coin to break. Some of the notable resistance to break includes the current zone at $0.00001270, the $0.00002021 zone, $0.00003075, and the old ATH at $0.00008846. Breaking these zones could help the Shiba Inu coin cancel out some zeros, but the $1 range could still be far-reaching and might not be possible this year. Remittix Stays Closer to Hitting $1 This Year The Remittix token has been the talk of top analysts for the past few weeks, as the new token continues to wow investors and critics with its growth so far. While the Remittix presale round gets closer every day to its final lap, the price growth has not shown any sign of slowing down. Currently, the funds raised in the Remittix ICO have hit a new high of almost $13.9M, showing the resilience and strong potential of this new token. However, while the Remittix token continues to look like it can only keep going up, what does the future look like after its presale round? The Remittix token, being a big project of the Remittix exchange, has been designed to get strong backing from the exchange. The Remittix exchange, however, is a new crypto solution changing the dynamics of crypto-FIAT payment. This solution helps users convert and send cryptocurrencies from their wallet directly to a bank account cheaply and faster. This new solution in the crypto market and the projected high demand for the exchange service by individuals and businesses are what analysts believe will keep driving the Remittixprice up. Although the presale price of the Remittix token is currently $0.0734, it is projected to see a surge of over 50x after launching, meaning the price will grow 50 times. This could easily take the Remittix price over $1 before the end of this year. This would be a great opportunity to take advantage of the Remittix token price now, which is less than $1.

As several projects struggle with volatility, investors are now taking a hard look at cryptocurrencies quietly reaching milestones. One such project, the Pi Coin, just had its sixth birthday, attracting investors' interest. However, another token , Remittix, remains in the shadows and might have greater potential. Pi Coin Celebrates Big Milestones—What Does It Mean for Investors? Currently priced at around $1.4, Pi Network celebrated its sixth birthday recently , with two milestones: the Mainnet migration completion and the successful launch of Open Network PiFest. These steps reflect the platform's maturity and increasing adoption. Pi Network's recent auctions of the.pi domain are strengthening its ecosystem, bringing in real-world use cases. Price action is still mixed, with Pi Coin trading between $1.20 and $1.90 as the community raises concerns about stringent KYC verification policies. Pi Coin bull investors are hopeful that upcoming exchange listings and additional adoption can boost the token exponentially. Some predictors even estimate prices to rise as high as $200-$500 in 2030 if the market environment is favorable. But dangers do lurk. Falling below the key support of $1.20 would take Pi Coin downwards, and wary investors would shy away from committing themselves fully. Pi has to keep up the momentum in order not to fall into bearishness. Source: Tradingview Remittix Shines as a Hidden Gem at $0.0734 Despite the success of the Pi Coin, Remittix is quietly building itself into a crypto market dark horse. With a current price of $0.0734, Remittix is making headlines with its revolutionary PayFiprotocol. Already having raised close to $13.9 million in its presale phase, Remittix sent over 520 million tokens into wallets, reflecting the rising popularity. Apparently, investors are impressed by the real-world functionality delivered by the project and have expressed huge confidence in its development prospects. Compared to other altcoins, Remittix simplifies payments in cryptocurrency. People can send cryptocurrency and convert it instantly into their currency in the real world, solving one of cryptocurrency's biggest problems: utilizing it in the real world. Consider an Ethiopian coffee exporter who receives payment from Europe and North America. Gains in most instances are lost due to delayed wire transfers and costly conversions leading to loss and lateness. Remittix receives such payments in real-time and remits them directly into cash currency in the local country. This easy solution aside from saving expense also saves efficiency and this is why businesses use Remittix over other payment systems. To this end, Remittix raised close to $13.9 million in its presale process by selling over a half a billion tokens. These figures show immense investor support for the Remittix cause and set it up for immense growth this year. Contrary to the majority of hype tokens, Remittix adoption comes as a result of practical use and thus remains very attractive to investors in times of volatile markets. Remittix Could Be the Crypto Star of 2025 As investors evaluate Pi Coin and similar projects, Remittix’s practical approach to digital payments positions it uniquely. Its growing popularity among merchants and individual users illustrates a genuine market need. Remittix’s PayFi protocol addresses real-world problems, such as delays, high fees, and exchange rate losses. This creates consistent demand even when broader markets fluctuate. Given its strong early performance, Remittix could easily become one of this year’s breakout stars. Investors looking for stability and tangible benefits should seriously consider this promising newcomer in crypto. Ready to explore the token analysts call the hidden gem of 2025? Visit Remittix to discover how its PayFi approach is changing cross-border transactions and why investors are jumping in early.

The rapid growth of Pi Coin got attention in the past but Remittix (RTX) stands as a rising contender that demands increasing attention. The directed strategy combined with practical financial solution development at Remittix positions it to have stronger prospects than Pi Network despite recent challenges. A Tough Stretch for Pi Coin The coin price for Pi Coin experienced downward trends throughout recent weeks.

At the time when these price decreases happened Pi Coin held between $1.43 and $1.59 trading rates before dropping to about 51% under its $2.99 highest mark in history on CoinGecko records. source: coingecko.com The value decline becomes associated with continuous obstacles throughout the Pi Network.

Numerous users of Pi Coin encountered significant difficulties during the mainnet migration because of KYC and technical problems and token transfer issues.

Remittix (RTX) is the one to watch in 2025. Its innovative crypto-to-fiat conversion system is going to completely rethink cross-border transactions as we know them. Read on to learn more about the token. Polygon (POL) Suffers Massive Price Decline As 99% of Polygon's (POL) holders experience price loss, the slide of Polygon toward $0.21 keeps on. Over a 24-hour period, the blockchain lost $13.2 million worth of liquidity, which strengthens forecasts of a continuous downward market trend. Prices have decreased by 34.45% monthly during this time of extreme withdrawal, hence market players are hurrying to identify fresh investment prospects. Polygon's declining price does not exhibit any indication of a transient development. The Artemis data reveals a constant negative flow of money from its chain network, therefore indicating general declining confidence within its network. Most POL token holders now find themselves in a hazardous scenario and run the risk of losing their funds. Open Interest dropped 1.29% in futures markets at the same time trade volume increased by 73% to suggest aggressive short-positioning activity. The technical study shows unfavorabletrends because POL approaches the February key support level. Remittix Is Set To Surge Providing fast and reasonably priced cross-border solutions, Remittix (RTX) is redefining global payments by aggregating FIAT transactions with blockchain technologies. Supported by more than forty cryptocurrencies, the platform provides rapid translations into FIAT currencies like USD and GBP, therefore enabling simple bank account deposits. Remittix is the better alternative to conventional payment providers like Stripe and Wise. As a link between crypto and FIAT, both crypto-exclusive systems like Coinbase Wallet and Remittix guarantee accessibility and inclusivity for companies and people by supporting over 50 crypto pairs and 30+ FIAT currencies, simplifying world trade. Notable also is the platform's open flat-fee approach, which offers savings and transparency over absurd rates of exchange of conventional banks. In the payments industry, Remittix is revolutionary since this approach guarantees that the whole amount transferred reaches the recipient, therefore addressing unethical activity all too often. Why Now Is The Best Time To Buy Remittix At $0.0734 in the presale stage, the RTX coin offers a good investment potential. Forecasts reveal an interesting rise; demand for innovative cross-border payment solutions is generating a 25x multiplier in the presale phase and over 1,500% increases following launch.

Imagine getting into a meme coin early, riding the wave, and cashing out with a life-changing 3650% ROI. The meme market is heating up with the top new meme coins to join in March 2025, and the best part? Some of the biggest gainers of 2025 haven’t even hit the mainstream yet. While everyone scrambles to chase old projects, smart investors are already stacking up presale gems that could explode. BTFD Coin (BTFD) is thriving with a potential moonshot to $0.006, making waves with its Bulls Squad community and high-stakes referral program. Add in the explosive Pudgy Penguins and Peanut the Squirrel, and you’ve got a power trio primed for massive gains. Let’s dive into why these are the top new meme coins to join in March 2025 before the next big pump. 1. BTFD Coin (BTFD) – The 3650% ROI Beast With a Bulls Squad Ready to Charge If you’ve ever missed a life-changing meme coin rally, BTFD is handing you a second chance on a silver platter. This isn’t just another presale—it’s a full-fledged movement built around the legendary Buy The Dip mindset. While the market panics, BTFD holders are buying in, stacking up, and charging straight to the moon with this top new meme coin to join in March 2025. Currently, in its 14th presale stage, BTFD Coin is already making headlines, having raised over $6.32 million with 11,400+ holders locking in their positions. The current price sits at $0.00016, but once the presale ends, BTFD will launch at $0.0006—meaning anyone investing today could triple their money before it even hits exchanges. Now, let’s talk numbers. Suppose you throw in $13,500 at $0.00016 per coin. That bags you 84.375 million BTFD tokens . When BTFD reaches its projected $0.006 moonshot, that stack would be worth a jaw-dropping $506,250! Even if you’re aiming for the short-term, by presale launch at $0.0006, your bag still turns into $50,625—insane gains for an early entry. But BTFD isn’t just about price speculation. The Bulls Squad—featuring Baby Bull, Raging Bull, Nerdy Bull, and Peoples Bull—has created a strong community-driven ecosystem with staking, a 90% APY, and an engaging Play-to-Earn (P2E) game that lets you earn rewards while having fun. The full version of the BTFD game is now live, bringing even more utility and engagement to the project. And if you love making money while doing nothing, BTFD’s Referral Rewards Program lets you earn 10% in BTFD tokens when people use your referral code. If you’re in the top 20 referrers by the end of the month, you’re stacking even more rewards. Why is BTFD shining bright among the top new meme coins to join in March 2025? No meme coin presale right now has this level of community hype, staking rewards, and explosive potential. 2. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) – The NFT King Entering the Meme Coin Space Pudgy Penguins has already cemented itself as an NFT blue-chip, but its entrance into the meme coin world has flipped the script. The project’s expansion from NFTs to crypto tokens is bringing millions of dollars in liquidity, backed by a loyal community of die-hard holders who won’t let it sink. The Pudgy Penguins meme coin is all about interoperability between NFTs and DeFi. Holders can stake, earn, and participate in ecosystem growth while reaping benefits from an already thriving brand. With exclusive NFT integration and limited-edition token airdrops, this is more than just another meme coin—it’s a full-blown Web3 economy. Why does PENGU deserve a spot among the top new meme coins to join in March 2025? Because it’s merging two of crypto’s hottest sectors—NFTs and meme coins—in a way that few have ever pulled off. 3. Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) – The Meme Coin With a Nuts Community If you think meme coins are just a trend, the Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) community is here to prove you wrong. This meme project skyrocketed after its Coinbase listing, and despite market dips, its engagement remains stronger than ever. The secret? A community-first approach with a hilarious, meme-worthy brand that keeps investors engaged. PNUT has built its reputation with interactive community events, staking rewards, and influencer-driven growth. Unlike other meme coins that rely purely on hype, Peanut the Squirrel actually delivers fun utility, and value. From exclusive airdrops to partnerships in the NFT space, PNUT is positioning itself as a long-term player in the meme coin world. Why is PNUT worth watching besides the top new meme coins to join in March 2025? Because while other meme coins fade, this one has a community so strong, that they’d rather hoard PNUT than sell it. Final Thoughts – The Window to Huge Gains is Closing Fast! Meme coins aren’t just for laughs anymore—they’re making life-changing money for early investors. If you’re looking for top new meme coins to join in March 2025, these three are leading the charge. BTFD Coin is already turning heads with its 3650% ROI potential, Pudgy Penguins is breaking boundaries with NFT integration, and Peanut the Squirrel is proving that community-backed projects thrive even in rough markets. But here’s the deal—these opportunities won’t stay at these prices for long. BTFD is already in Stage 14, and once the presale ends, the price jumps to $0.0006. If you want to maximize your gains, now’s the time to get in before the window slams shut. The meme coin boom of 2025 is just getting started, and only those who act fast will be the ones cashing out when the real fireworks begin.

BTFD’s referral program lets users earn 10% in BTFD tokens when someone uses their referral code to invest. If you’re in the top 20 referrers, you get even bigger rewards. The leaderboard resets monthly, so the more you refer, the more you earn! Why is BTFD’s Bulls Squad important for the community? The Bulls Squad is the backbone of BTFD, representing the strongest diamond-hand community in the presale. Baby Bull, Raging Bull, Nerdy Bull, and Peoples Bull, it create a fun, engaging, and community-driven movement rather than just another meme coin. What makes Pudgy Penguins different from other meme coins? Pudgy Penguins isn’t just a meme coin—it’s backed by a blue-chip NFT project with massive brand recognition. It bridges the gap between NFTs and crypto, providing exclusive staking benefits, airdrops, and DeFi integrations. How can Peanut the Squirrel keep its momentum? PNUT thrives on a powerful community, influencer backing, and real utility. With its Coinbase listing, staking rewards, and NFT partnerships, it continues to evolve while keeping investors engaged with regular events and token burns. Is investing in meme coin presales safer than buying after launch? Yes! Presales offer lower entry prices, protect against market volatility, and provide exclusive rewards. BTFD’s presale, for example, lets investors triple their money before listing—a massive advantage over post-launch buyers.

WIF could reach a maximum price of $3.98 by the end of 2028. By 2031, WIF’s price may surge to $6.46. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to the crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins hitting the market afterwards. Dogwifhat has thus far recorded significant feats in terms of valuation and exchange listing. The token approached the $5 mark on March 31, 2024 ($4.58B market cap), saw massive price movements after the November U.S. elections, and got listed on Binance US, Coinbase, KuCoin, Robinhood, and more. However, a massive bear market ensued, and WIF lost momentum. Leaving investors asking: How high can dogwifhat crypto go? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs). Overview Cryptocurrency Dogwifhat Ticker WIF Current price $0.464 Market cap $463,862,590.8 Trading volume $170.73M Circulating supply 998,840,965.85 WIF All-time high $4.85 on March 31, 2024 All-time low $0.000023 on November 2023 24-hour high $0.5022 24-hour low $0.4638 Dogwifhat price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 13.61% 50-day SMA $0.791 14-Day RSI 38.86 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 30 (Fear) Green days 12/30 (30%) 200-Day SMA $1.903 Dogwifhat (WIF) price analysis: WIF sees minor gains, bullish reversal imminent? TL;DR Breakdown WIF shows signs of recovery in the short term but is not yet significant. Dogwifhat (WIF) resistance is present at around $0.528. WIF’s immediate support level is present at $0.429. Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart: WIF faces rejection at $0.528 WIF/USDT is in a downtrend on March 16 after facing rejection at $0.528 on the previous two candlesticks. The MACD is slightly bullish, suggesting potential for a rebound, and the RSI (37.87) shows neutral to oversold condition. If $0.429 holds, a recovery toward $0.528, $0.601 or $0.649 is possible. A breakdown below $0.429 could lead to further declines. WIF faces rejection at $0.528 Dogwifhat price analysis 4-hour chart: WIF to retest $0.492 soon? The 4-hour WIF/USDT shows a clear decline in price, though with some recovery brewing. Dogwifhat currently trades just above the lower Bollinger Band (a short-term support level). A bounce from this level could lead to another attempt at the $0.492 resistance level. WIF to retest $0.492 soon? The MFI reflects a seller-dominated market, while the Balance of Power (BOP) suggests a bullish bias, though not significantly overwhelming the selling pressure. To confirm the position of the BOP indicator, WIF needs to recapture the $0.492 price level and break past resistance at $0.525. Dogwifhat technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.8692 SELL SMA 5 $0.7200 SELL SMA 10 $0.7153 SELL SMA 21 $0.6470 SELL SMA 50 $0.7912 SELL SMA 100 $1.4255 SELL SMA 200 $1.9036 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.6153 SELL EMA 5 $0.7531 SELL EMA 10 $1.0408 SELL EMA 21 $1.4250 SELL EMA 50 $1.9466 SELL EMA 100 $2.21 SELL EMA 200 $2.25 SELL What to expect from WIF price analysis? The broader outlook for WIF is bearish. In the meantime, a recapture and break out of the $0.492 – $0.528 price level is needed to confirm a possible bullish reversal, while a long-term push above $0.649 could signal a sustainable uptrend. A failed bullish attempt could result in further price declines towards $0.395. Is Dogwifhat crypto a good investment? Dogwifhat (WIF) is a meme coin on the Solana blockchain. Its value is driven by community interest and speculation. Projections indicate that by 2025, the price could recover to about $1 to $1.5. While it may have potential for short-term gains, it’s equally risky. Only invest after thorough research. Where to buy WIF? Currently, traders and investors can buy Dogwifhat (WIF) on these CEXs: Binance, Binance.US, Raydium, Coinbase Exchange, Gate.io, KuCoin, Crypto.com Exchange, MEXC, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, LBank and several other s . Why is $WIF down? WIF is down after recently facing rejection at $0.529. The coin is down due to diminishing market interest and folding liquidity triggered by massive selloffs and a shift to other assets that investors consider more profitable. Dogwifhat (WIF) price chart | Coinmarketcap Dogwifhat (WIF) price chart | Coinmarketcap Will WIF reach $10? Having reached a peak price of $4.85 in 2024, the $10 target might not be too far-fetched. Can Dogwifhat reach $100? Dogwifhat (WIF) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and could be unlikely. Its market must be at least $99.9 billion – a value that exceeds the highest market cap ever for a meme (Dogecoin) at $88.79 billion. DOGE’s marketcap history | GlobalData Does WIF have a good long-term future? WIF has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of about $1.2 by the end of 2025 and about $5 to $7 by 2031. However, as with all meme coins, WIF’s future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support.

According to the announcement , the initiative could first be in a three-year experimental regime. The banking institution’s idea is to enable crypto trading for only those Russian investors who have at least 100 million rubles (or $1.1 million) in securities and deposits or whose annual income in the previous year exceeded 50 million rubles (approximately $570,000). The proposal allows entities categorized as qualified investors under current legislation to participate in the experiment. The Bank of Russia also aims to establish certain regulatory requirements for financial organizations willing to adopt cryptocurrency. The introduction of this regime could increase market transparency, offer more opportunities for experienced investors who are open to taking on higher risks, and establish clear standards. In the past, Russia’s central bank has repeatedly warned that cryptocurrencies are not issued or guaranteed by any jurisdiction and are notorious for their enhanced volatility. As such, investors should be aware that entering the ecosystem might result in crucial losses. The banking institution still does not recognize the asset class as a means of payment. That said, it proposed banning transactions between residents involving cryptocurrencies outside the experimental regime and enforcing penalties for violating this rule. On the other hand, multiple reports have emerged since Russia’s ‘special military operation’ against Ukraine that started over three years ago that local firms, as well as the government, are using crypto to bypass Western sanctions.

As Ripple advances its legal battle and files new trademarks, how will XRP markets react in the week ahead? Ripple (XRP) Tumbles 8% to End 4-Day Winning Streak Ripple (XRP) emerged as one of the top-performing assets last week, fueled by renewed optimism in Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). On Thursday, FOX analysts reported that the SEC is considering classifying XRP as a commodity as part of ongoing settlement negotiations to conclude the long-running case against Ripple. The SEC is reportedly using Ethereum’s current regulatory treatment as a benchmark in its deliberations. Ripple (XRP) Price Action | March 16 If this reclassification materialises, it could significantly enhance XRP’s prospects for ETF approval and potential inclusion in a strategic crypto reserve. However, after four consecutive days of green candles for Ripple price , driven by the SEC reclassification speculations, another major regulatory headline appears to have cut the XRP price rally short. Why Is XRP Price Going Down Today? After a four-day winning streak fueled by speculation that the SEC may classify XRP as a commodity, another major SEC announcement appears to have halted the rally. On Friday, March 14, the SEC announced its decision to pause the approval process for altcoin ETFs , triggering a downturn in the prices of top altcoins over the weekend, particularly those with ETF filings in progress. This development partly explains why XRP’s price has now plunged 8%, dropping from its Friday peak of $2.49 to $2.29 as of March 16. Derivatives Market Analysis Flashing Early Rebound Signals Despite the recent price dip, XRP’s derivatives market metrics indicate that bullish sentiment may still be in play. First, the latest Coinglass data shows, XRP’s trading volume has increased by 12.11%, reaching $6.05 billion. This suggests that despite the price pullback, there is still significant market activity. Ripple (XRP) Derivatives Market Analysis | Source: Coinglass Also, the 24-hour liquidation data (Rekt) stands at $11.58 million, with $8.98 million in long positions and $2.60 million in short positions. This suggests that while longs took losses amid the weekend drop, short sellers are now at risk of a squeeze if the price stabilizes. XRP’s open interest has dropped by 6.70% to $3.14 billion, indicating that leveraged positions are unwinding. This could signal the end of the current correction, setting the stage for a fresh uptrend if demand picks up. With strong derivatives volume and long positions outweighing shorts, the market appears to be positioning for a rebound. If broader sentiment improves and regulatory fears subside, XRP could regain momentum in the coming days. 3 Key Events XRP Traders Must Watch in the Week Ahead XRP’s correction phase appears temporary, with derivatives market indicators pointing to sustained bullish momentum. Here are key factors influencing price movements this week: 1. Ripple Files Trademark for New Crypto Wallet Application According to recent media posts , Ripple has reportedly filed for a trademark under the name “RIPPLE CUSTODY,” which hints at a potential new product focused on crypto storage solutions. Ripple Files Trademark for New Cryptocurrency Wallet Application, March 16, 2025 This development could drive fresh investor interest in the week ahead. For optimistic market watchers, Ripple is now in pole position to leverage international partnerships, and friendlier regulators to ship fresh innovative products that had been hampered during years of long litigation. 2. U.S. Federal Reserve Decision on February 19 The upcoming Fed meeting will play a crucial role in shaping broader market sentiment. Any hints of dovish monetary policy could spark increased risk appetite, potentially benefiting XRP and other digital assets. 3. SEC Pauses Altcoin ETF Approvals, but Market Watches for Further Developments The SEC has temporarily halted decisions on altcoin ETF applications, but industry analysts expect continued discussions. Strategic investors will keenly watch out for Soundbites, and insights from key ETF sponsors in the coming weeks. XRP Price Forecast: Bulls Eye $2.80 Rebound XRP price forecast suggests a broader crypto market recovery is underway, setting the stage for XRP’s next move. The XRP/USDT daily chart presents a mix of consolidation and volatility, but key technical indicators hint at a potential rebound. The Keltner Channel (KC) midline at $2.35 is acting as immediate resistance, and a breakout above this level could open the door toward the upper KC band near $2.77. XRP Price Forecast The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 47.49 sits in neutral territory, signaling neither overbought nor oversold conditions. However, its recent bounce from 40 suggests growing bullish momentum. A sustained RSI climb above 50 would reinforce the case for continued upside. Despite the recent 8.38% dip in a single session, volume data shows a healthy recovery, with prior bullish days recording over 1.25 billion in volume—a sign that buyers remain engaged. If XRP can maintain support near $2.30, the bulls could regain control, driving prices toward $2.50 in the short term and $2.80 in extension. On the flip side, failure to hold $2.30 could invite deeper retracements, potentially testing the lower KC band near $1.92.

Trader Ali Martinez tells his 132,900 followers on the social media platform X that whales gobbled up more than $815.514 million worth of ETH in less than a week. “Whales have bought more than 420,000 Ethereum ETH in [five days]!” Source: Ali Martinez/X Martinez is also keeping a close watch on Ethereum’s In/Out of the Money Around Price (IOMAP) metric – which classifies crypto addresses as either profiting, breaking even, or losing money – to determine support and resistance levels for ETH. According to Martinez, ETH is currently trading in a narrow range between stiff support and resistance zones. “Ethereum ETH key levels to watch! On-chain data reveals $1,870 as the strongest support and $2,050 as its toughest resistance!” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, ETH is trading for $1,941.

The target is $90,000 as long as the $84,000 support holds.” Source: Ali Martinez/X An ascending triangle pattern may be considered a bullish reversal structure if the asset soars above its horizontal resistance.

Busting out of this triangle will trigger a 15% price move.” Source: Ali Martinez/X A triangle is typically viewed as a consolidation pattern as it signals a potential breakout in either direction.

Participants in Pi Network gained 1000% through early investments since the network had not obtained broad market acceptance at that time. During its early price increase many people overlooked the gemstone and consequently started to doubt whether they would encounter another similar lucrative opportunity. The project Remittixgenerated a presale success rate worth $13.9 million through selling 520 million+ tokens at $0.0734 each. Lessons from Pi Network’s Rapid Rise PI Chart since its inception on February 20, 2025. Source: tradingview Pi Network became known to the public due to its remarkable 1000% growth. The sudden price spike surprised seasoned traders about how quickly altcoins move from small community use to widespread global adoption. Manifesting dramatic value growth serves as evidence for spotting worthwhile cryptocurrency projects when they start at a low level since market performance often leads to unnatural cost elevation. The ability to mine Pi grew popular among crypto users because of its user-friendly mobile platform along with its easy-accessible mining process which allowed more people to participate. The inclusive philosophy of the platform eventually transformed into widespread curiosity which resulted in exceptional price growth. People who did not catch the initial opportunity study alternative coins that demonstrate real market potential for explosive growth. Introducing Remittix: A Real-World Payment Focus The core focus of Remittix lies in delivering instant crypto-to-fiat solutions compared to how Pi depended on community-building and accessibility features. The team seeks to make the process easy for regular people and companies exchanging digital tokens with traditional currencies since it represents a major barrier toward blockchain adoption. The Remittix token features both business utility and simple design elements which help it exceed the role of exchange tokens.The Remittix presale reached recognition when it accepted $13.9 million through the sale of 520 million tokens. Investors recognize the market potential of creating a simple solution between regular currency and cryptocurrency exchanges since new adopters face challenges with difficult steps and variable costs and delayed transactions. Remittix could equal or exceed Pi's value growth by maintaining strategic partnership deals between merchants, remittance services as well as e-commerce platforms. Roadmap Highlights and Potential Catalysts The foundation of Remittix relies heavily on the natural buzz generated by its community members just like Pi Network. As well as building community buzz the initiative develops a regulatory-conscious framework to draw institutional support. Support from bigger organizations would grow through establishing clear legal guidelines with robust oversight mechanisms. The token price can jump rapidly if Remittix completes essential alliances which include facilitating immediate crypto payouts across gig-economy platforms. The future growth of the altcoin directly depends on how it implements its planned expansions. Many projects incur failure after making their expansion too rapid. Remittix will succeed by moving at a controlled speed and providing stable exchanges between crypto assets and demonstrating genuine use examples. The implementation of hyped-driven growth initiatives that extend beyond reasonable capacity boundaries leads to price drops. The token works to protect its clear mission through its focus on rapid settlements to build strong adoption of its users. Conclusion: A Potential Successor to Pi Network’s Leap A profitable launch takes place when token platforms create useful platforms which community support networks accept. The market has received a new promising technology called Remittix which enables digital currency use through standard shopping activities. The continuing success of the presale demonstrates widespread faith in the project from many people. The practical solutions that Remittix delivers create conditions for widespread mainstream adoption of its product even with rapidly changing markets. People who did not secure Pi's 1000% surge now have an opportunity to participate in Remittixgrowth as the project sets course for widespread adoption. Current success in presale indicates the potential for Remittix to become the anticipated breakthrough in cryptocurrency based on its roadmap's expected success and widespread payment demand.

Trump has spoken about this goal many times, even before he was elected, and he continues to emphasise it. In a recent speech, he discussed the strict rules set by the previous administration and explained how his team is working to build the country’s crypto reserves. He highlighted five cryptocurrencies: XRP (Ripple), Solana, Cardano (ADA), Bitcoin, and Ethereum. The crypto market, which often reacts strongly to the news, saw a 62% increase in the value of XRP, Solana, and ADA and a 10% rise in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Investing in these coins could be wise, as the administration plans to implement policies and regulations to support their growth. Let's look at them individually and why you should collect them after Trump’s mention. Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin is the first crypto coin released after the Satoshi paper. Despite breaking an all-time price high shortly after Trump’s election victory, it is expected to still rise in value thanks to Trump’s long-term crypto plans. Currently, the United States holds a large amount of BTC and is expected to buy more for its proposed reserve. Bitcoin is often regarded as digital gold because of its scarcity and potential for long-term growth. As a result, it is one of the most highly traded assets in crypto trading . It is also the most liquid coin, which makes it easy to buy and sell. Due to its wide adoption as a mode of payment, it is a great option for you. Bitcoin currently hovers around $86,636.54 as of the time of writing. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum is another cryptocurrency you should consider. It is known for its decentralisation and is second only to Bitcoin regarding market cap. ETH has many use cases, including earning on investments by staking , playing games, and interacting on social media. Its smart-contract characteristics help eliminate the need for intermediaries, a form of security for the coin. With a market capitalisation of about $261.95B and a price range of $2,172.12 per Ethereum, it is expected to attract major investors in light of Trump’s recent speech. The total supply of Ethereum is about 120 million and runs on about 15.8 transactions per second. Thanks to a proof-of-stake mechanism , it is energy efficient and perfect for building Dapps like NFTs and DeFi tokens. These features make ETH a credible addition to your portfolio at the moment. Ripple (XRP) Ripple’s XRP has been on several investors’ radars since former Securities and Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler stepped down. Buying XRP is a smart move due to the tokens' unique properties. It is one of the cryptocurrencies known for its international payment, and it is not mined like other coins; instead, it is obtained through a process known as a unique consensus mechanism. XRP's market capitalisation is about $145 billion, with a price of about $2.50 and a circulating supply of 57 billion. It has very fast translation speeds, and it is used mainly by big financial institutions for payments. Due to its low transaction cost, you could also use XRP for cross-border payments. Solana (SOL) Solana has many profitable prospects, as it has grown by over 11% in recent weeks. It has become a point of interest for savvy crypto investors after being mentioned by the president, and rightly so. It has a total supply of about 595 million Solana with a price tag of about $145.68. Its market capitalisation is about $73 billion, with about 65,000 transactions per second, which makes it very fast and highly scalable. You could also use Solana for the building of NFTs, just like ADA and ETH, and you also don’t have to worry about transaction fees as they are low. Are you thinking of a cryptocurrency that has short and long-term profit prospects? Solana is a good option. Cardano (ADA) Cardano’s ADA has powerful scaling properties, which is one reason you should consider collecting ADA. It was created using Proof of Stake ouroboros, which minimises energy consumption. This coin was launched in September 2017 and has about 35 billion ADA in circulation, with a current price of $0.87. Despite its current valuation per token, which stands at less than a dollar, it has a high propensity for growth in the long run. It has a market capitalisation of about $12.67 billion and plans to achieve about 1 million transactions per second. ADA allows easy interaction with other blockchains and uses smart contracts, which can be used to explore Dapps like NFTs. Criteria To Consider Before Collecting a Coin These five coins mentioned by the president of the US are viable crypto additions to your portfolio. Still, before acquiring them, you must ensure that the coins you acquire are perfect for your needs. Here are tips to help you make the right crypto investment choice: ● Adoption: Analyze how many people adopt the coin and what institution recognises it. A wide adoption can be social proof. ● Market trends: Check for the market trends of the coin you plan to invest in, as it will guide you on how the coin has been performing. Opting for a coin in the top market trend might be a good decision.● Price performance: Knowing the coin's previous and current price can also give you insight into its performance. Even though the price action might not reflect the coin's actual value, it can provide insight into its performance.● Utility: Knowing the coin's utility can help you discern the coin’s actual value. This can be obtained from its use cases. For example, if the coin’s ‘use cases’ improve, the coin will improve.

Alphractal points to the Global Economic Policy Uncertainty Index and the Economic Policy Uncertainty Index for the United States, both of which are nearing their highest levels on record. Historically, such increases in uncertainty have been associated with higher market volatility and, in some cases, economic recessions. The Global Economic Policy Uncertainty Index is a measure of economic policy uncertainty across 20 major economies, taking into account media reports, forecast discrepancies, and tax law changes. A higher index value indicates greater uncertainty that could affect investment decisions, currency fluctuations, and broader financial markets. Related News: Watch Out: 23 Altcoins Have Massive Token Unlocks in the New Week - Here's the Day-by-Day, Hour-by-Hour List Similarly, the U.S. Economic Policy Uncertainty Index assesses uncertainty in the U.S. by analyzing media coverage, tax policy expirations, and changes in economic forecasts. Increases in this index have often preceded periods of economic turmoil and instability. Alphractal warns that increased economic uncertainty could increase volatility across multiple asset classes, including stocks, bonds, and cryptocurrencies. Historical trends suggest that increases in uncertainty often lead to significant market volatility, as seen in past economic crises when both the S&P 500 and Bitcoin (BTC) exhibited significant price swings. According to the analytics company, for cryptocurrency investors, these developments may indicate a period in which price movements will increase and market trends will be unpredictable. *This is not investment advice.

41780857,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=694125,1742171322,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/41780857.jpeg,Solana ($SOL) celebrates 5 years since its official launch,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/solana-sol-celebrates-5-years-since-launch/,"Blockchain platform Solana commemorates its fifth year in the crypto industry since launching in 2020. So far, the network has processed close to $410 billion worth of transactions with a little over 1300 validators. Not to mention, the ecosystem also boasts impressive DEX trading volumes, almost surpassing $1 trillion . Solana’s Gokal encourages the crypto community to launch their own tokens In an X post on March 16, Solana acknowledged its developers and founders who worked hard to build the network and even suggested that the platform has more projects lined up for the crypto community. Co-founder Raj Gokal also commented, leaning towards encouraging developers to introduce their own tokens. He stated, “If we could launch then, you can launch now.” Gokal recalled what was happening on planet Earth at this time five years ago, when everyone around the world was on lockdown and projects, especially crypto, were being cancelled one by one. Anatoly Yakovenko, Solana’s co-founder, also joined in the celebration, wishing all the platform’s enthusiasts worldwide a happy Solana 0 block day. Yakovenko also said that everything was going according to plan, and looking at the characteristics of SOL as a blockchain, few people would argue with this. Solana’s ecosystem still has over $8.5 billion in total value locked in DeFi protocols, having handled more than $408 billion in transactions. Moreover, the network’s fees and revenues are more than double that of Ethereum, and the SOL token has just over $65.5 billion in market cap. SOL could surge past the $300 mark in September 2025 Solana’s price has been under pressure, plunging from $180 in February to current levels below $140. The token’s price slid slightly by 5.67% in the last 24 hours, trading at only $126.83 . The futures market provides a similar snapshot. Funding rates on SOL perpetual futures have been negative for three days, and short sellers are currently paying to hold their positions — an indication of little demand for leveraged long positions. Perhaps more worrying, accumulation has stalled. The total number of Solana wallets holding at least 10,000 SOL fell from 5,053 to 5,023, a signal some large investors may be cashing out or reducing exposure. Analysts believe that SOL has enough room to recover despite steps taken down in the last few days. They even forecast a 10% surge over the next month and a new record by the end of the year. Experts also expect the token’s price to range between $127.50 and $150.14 and have an ROI of 12.76% in the three-month period ending June. They even estimate the token’s average price of $135.99. Some even project that the asset will be trading far above $300 by September 2025. On the other hand, some have estimated prices to oscillate at somewhere between $235.73 and $311.32, with an ROI of at least 133%. Firedancer upgrade set to boost Solana’s speed and stability The next major milestone for Solana’s blockchain is expected to be the launch of Jump Crypto’s Firedancer client—an alternative high-performance validator designed to enhance the network’s transaction throughput and resilience against threats and outages. A testnet version and a prototype mainnet iteration called Frankendancer were introduced in September 2023. Though its launch was originally planned for the second quarter of 2024, Firedancer is widely expected to launch in full this year. Helius co-founder Mert Memtaz, a significant figure in the Solana community, predicted in December that Firedancer will go live “end of Q2.” The upgrade is expected to help Solana scale towards its goal of 1 million transactions per second (TPS). Meanwhile, Solana could also be approved for inclusion in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in 2024. According to The Block’s ETF tracking data, several asset managers have filed for Solana-based ETFs. Analysts have identified Solana—alongside Litecoin, Dogecoin, and XRP—as a strong contender for ETF approval. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

UK Royal Court of Appeal Judge Christopher Nugee knocked back Howells’ application, stating that there was no “real prospect of success” and there was “no other compelling reason” as to why it should be heard, according to a March 13 filing shared with Cointelegraph. Source: James Howells Nugee’s decision follows an earlier dismissal on Jan. 9 from High Court Judge Andrew Keyser, who similarly said there was “no realistic prospect” of Howells’ case succeeding at a full trial. In a note to Cointelegraph, Howell said his “last legal option” to exhaust is at the ECHR — where he will claim that the UK High Court and UK Court of Appeal breached his right to property and right to a fair trial under Article 1 of Protocol 1 and Article 6 of the ECHR. “The British establishment want to sweep this under the carpet, and i will not let them. It will not go away — no matter how long it takes!” The ECHR cannot overrule a UK court decision — however, a verdict in Howells’ favor would call on the UK courts to consider whether its legislation was interpreted in a way that is compatible with the ECHR’s provisions. In a separate statement shared with Cointelegraph, Howells said he would file a claim to the ECHR in the “coming weeks.” The court filings follow repeated rejections from the Newport City Council allowing Howells to search through the Docksway landfill — where Howells’ former partner disposed of a bag containing the hard drive at the site in 2013. Related: Burning quantum-vulnerable BTC is the best option — Jameson Lopp Howells’ 8,000 Bitcoin ( BTC ) is worth around $660 million at current prices.

Individuals who ignored it at the right moment regretted missing out on massive profits later on. Remittix (RTX), at present, is on the same journey and offering a revolutionary payment solution on blockchain. RTX offers an actual use-case unlike speculative tokens and ranks as one of the most promising options in the industry right now. As Remittix snowballs along, many think RTX might be the next big star in the digital finance universe. Will traders miss out on another project with enormous adoption prospects yet again, or will RTX eclipse the success of Pi Coin? Pi Coin’s Journey: A Lesson in Missed Opportunities The current Pi Coin (PI) price is $1.45, a drop of 0.83%. Despite the drop in value, Pi Coin has attained a market cap of $10.06 billion, an indicator that risk-taking early investors are being rewarded. Source: Tradingview It nevertheless had a skeptical reception at launch and most people dismissed it as another experiment. It grew its network in due course of time and those who invested early reaped an immense profit from it. Unfortunately, most people didn't appreciate its rise to success and only noticed its value when it was too late. Now that Remittix (RTX) begins to ascend, investors are observing closely, determined not to make the same mistake. Why Remittix (RTX) Could Be the Next Big Crypto Remittix (RTX) is in the news as a blockchain-based financial platform that provides fee-free and real-time cryptocurrency-fiat transactions. RTX currently trades at $0.0734 and raised $13.9 million and sold 520 million tokens, reflecting strong investor interest. Compared to Pi Coin, which built its network through mobile mining, RTX is being built with use in the real world in mind. A US-based freelancer who does work for clients in Europe, for instance, can use RTX to receive payment instantly, avoiding banking commissions and settlement times. RTX is consequently a practical financial tool rather than a speculative vehicle. PayFi model of RTX provides a new standard in cryptocurrency payments and finds itself as one of the most promising blockchain payment prospects out there. Can Remittix (RTX) Outperform Pi Coin? The popularity of Pi Coin demonstrates blockchain innovations' potential for mass adoption, but Remittix (RTX) has something even better—actual use cases in the real world. While Pi Coin's development falls behind, RTX is seeing real-world adoption and is thus a high-growth investment opportunity. Unlike speculative meme coins or projects with questionable use cases, RTX is solving a global financial problem. Businesses, freelancers, and merchants are turning to RTX for seamless digital payments, and that's what's fueling its growing adoption. As the use of cryptocurrency keeps on increasing, the chances of RTX surpassing Pi Coin in market cap and growth in value improve by the day. With increasing use of cryptocurrency, RTX could be one of the largest winners in 2025. Why Now Is the Best Time to Invest in RTX Investors who missed Pi Coin’s early rise are now looking at Remittix (RTX) as a second chance. With its crypto-to-fiat payment system, RTX is attracting serious attention from investors and businesses alike. Unlike other speculative assets, RTX offers real-world financial applications, making it one of the most promising blockchain investments today. As more companies integrate crypto payments, RTX’s value is expected to rise significantly. For those looking for the next big opportunity, RTX presents a rare chance to get in early before mainstream adoption takes off. Invest in the Future of Blockchain Payments with Remittix (RTX) With Remittix gaining momentum, many investors are turning to RTX as the next major force in blockchain finance. Its focus on instant, low-cost transactions makes it a strong alternative to traditional banking systems. Pi Coin taught investors that early adoption in promising blockchain projects can lead to massive gains. Now, RTX is proving to be the next major opportunity in crypto payments. As blockchain adoption accelerates, RTX is positioning itself as a leader in financial technology, making it one of the most exciting crypto investments of the decade.

With institutional interest growing and regulatory clarity improving, XRP’s bullish momentum is building fast. But it’s not the only token poised for exponential gains Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a high-potential DeFi contender, attracting early investors with its innovative tokenomics and staggering growth projections. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), is gaining momentum and may hit that benchmark first. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) shows strong performance growth in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector through its dual-lending model innovation. The third phase of Mutuum Finance presale continues while this high-growth altcoin sells for $0.02 and has collected $3.2 million. The next stage of the presale will boost MUTM’s price to $0.025 while attracting more than 5500 investors while simultaneously raising funds to $0.03 million. The initial investors during this phase will receive a 200% payback when the launch price reaches $0.06 while future forecast estimates predict a value surge past $5 in the near future. A DeFi Giant on the Rise Mutuum Finance pushes forward decentralized lending through dual lending while promoting mass adoption because of its transformative structure. More than 5,700 investors joined the presale funding to support the project which received $3.4 million in total. Mutuum Finance’s price currently reaches $0.02 in Phase 3 even though investors anticipate a 25% price increase in Phase 4 which will generate considerable profit potential. The analysts forecast MUTM to surge beyond $5 in upcoming months when it launches at $0.06 because its distinctive lending approach meets rising market requirements thus making it an underappreciated yet promising DeFi resource. The Dual-Model System for Enhanced DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance transforms DeFi lending through the combination of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending systems. Through the P2C model users can achieve passive income by lending their USDT through liquidity pools that operate automatically through smart contracts. The P2P model provides transactions which operate without intermediaries allowing users to personally manage their assets through direct deals. Mutuum Finance unites P2C and P2P lending methods to secure and streamline its decentralized operation thus creating profitable opportunities for investors looking to maximize yield in DeFi. A Reliable and Secure Financial Network Mutuum Finance creates a launch plan for its new collateralized USD-backed stablecoin developed for Ethereum blockchain usage. Insolvency risks that threaten algorithmic stablecoins will not affect this over-collateralized asset because it will maintain long-term reliability. A complete audit system of smart contracts together with transparent financial mechanisms establishes trust with investors as it fixes numerous security problems observed with past decentralized finance projects. Driving Community Growth with Investor Rewards To attract more community members Mutuum Finance implements profitable incentive programs at an aggressive pace. The program will use $1 million to give ten investors $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens and the referral system gives rewards to users who bring in new investors to the platform. The platform gives early supporters exclusive benefits including staking pools and governance rights and VIP-exclusive updates to enhance their connection with the platform. Friendly Tokenomics for Lasting Expansion Tokenomics in the project follows a strategy designed for both limited token circulation management and continuous appreciation of value. The presale limitation combined with anti-inflationary procedures enables Mutuum Finance to establish scarcity which creates possible upward token value potential. Staking rewards users for token involvement by delivering valuable incentives that strengthen the ecosystem sustainability of its native token. Ripple (XRP) is gearing up for a potential breakout to $5, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could reach that milestone first. With $3.4M raised, and over 5,700 investors, MUTM is emerging as a major DeFi performer. Don’t miss out on the next big crypto winner.

In several examples posted to X, the email claims to be from Coinbase, asking users to transition to self-custodial wallets and providing instructions on downloading the legitimate Coinbase Wallet, giving a deadline of April 1 to make the switch. Source: Steve Kaczynski However, it also provides pre-generated recovery phrases . Once users open a new wallet with those phrases and transfer funds, all the assets will be available to the threat actor, who could drain the wallet. The email mentions a class-action lawsuit against Coinbase alleging it has sold unregistered securities, which has resulted in a court mandating users manage their own wallets. “Coinbase will operate as a registered broker, allowing purchases, but all assets must move to Coinbase Wallet,” the phony email says. The US Securities and Exchange Commission dismissed its lawsuit alleging Coinbase was an unregistered broker and selling unregistered securities on Feb. 27. Coinbase told Cointelegraph it is aware of the scam and pointed to its March 14 post to X, saying , “We will never send you a recovery phrase, and you should never enter a recovery phrase given to you by someone else.” Source: Coinbase Support Crypto exchange Gemini has also been spoofed with the same recovery phrase email scam, using the same tactics and claiming users need to set up a new wallet because of a recent court decision. Gemini was being sued by the SEC for allegedly offering unregistered securities through its earn program. The regulator opted to end the legal action on Feb. 26.

Arizona federal court Judge Douglas Rayes on March 13 granted the CFTC’s earlier motion for summary judgment in its case and ordered Debiex to pay back around $2.26 million it stole from its customers, along with a civil penalty of nearly $221,500. Judge Rayes said there was no evidence that Debiex’s failure to respond to the CFTC was the result of “excusable neglect.” The CFTC sued Debiex in January 2024, saying its staff ran a so-called “pig butchering” scam , where they initiated romantic relationships with customers over social media to gain trust to convince them to invest in the platform. The scheme hooked five victims who deposited around $2.3 million in total onto Debiex, which the purported trading platform stole, the CFTC said. A highlighted excerpt of Judge Rayes’ order summarizing the CFTC’s case against Debiex, Source: CourtListener The CFTC also accused Zhāng Chéng Yáng of being a “money mule” for Debiex, whose crypto wallets were used to accept and steal victims’ funds. Judge Rayes granted a CFTC motion for default judgment against Zhāng on March 12, finding it adequately alleged he controls a crypto wallet with OKX “that received digital assets to which he had no legitimate claim.” He said OKX was “voluntarily preserving” the crypto in Zhāng’s account and ordered its contents, consisting of $5.70 worth of Tether ( USDT ) and nearly 63 Ether ( ETH ) worth around $119,500, to be transferred to an unnamed victim. The CFTC said in its January 2024 complaint that Debiex’s scheme saw its unknown managers target potential victims through social media to lure them to websites it had created marketing itself as a “Blockchain Network Decentralized perpetual contract trading platform” where users can conduct futures trading and “Mining transactions.” Related: Four suspects charged in home invasion of streamer Amouranth Debiex’s staff would present as females and built a rapport with victims through “continuous and repeated messaging and sharing purported pictures of themselves” while claiming to be “highly successful digital asset commodities traders,” the CFTC said. Once an account was created and the customers sent over their crypto, the CFTC said Debiex would share “fictitious information” about customer balances, trading positions and profits. “All of this information was most likely false,” the CFTC said. “The evidence shows that the Customers’ digital assets were simply sent to numerous digital asset wallets in an attempt to obfuscate their destination.” Magazine: SEC’s U-turn on crypto leaves key questions unanswered",,EN,0,0,TRADING|USDT|BLOCKCHAIN|COMMODITY|ETH,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-03-17 02:11:07

Qubetics’ Presale Boom Puts It Ahead While AAVE and Ethereum Keep Dominating 2025,https://timestabloid.com/best-coins-to-buy-today-qubetics-presale-boom-puts-it-ahead/,"If you’re looking to invest in the best coins to buy today , Qubetics, AAVE, and Ethereum should definitely be on your radar. As the cryptocurrency market continues to heat up, these three coins are catching the eye of both casual crypto enthusiasts and seasoned professionals. Each of these projects brings something innovative to the table, with the potential to shape the future of blockchain, decentralized finance, and digital transactions. Qubetics, a rising star in the crypto world, has already made waves with its decentralized VPN and interoperability solutions, making it one of the most exciting tokens to watch in 2025. Ethereum continues to dominate the blockchain space with its Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, which promises to solve scalability issues while maintaining its position as the go-to platform for decentralized applications (dApps). Meanwhile, AAVE is still a powerhouse in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, revolutionizing how users borrow and lend digital assets. Qubetics: The Interoperable Blockchain Solution You Didn’t Know You Needed When it comes to the best coins to buy today, Qubetics is undeniably a standout. The project isn’t simply riding the wave of blockchain hype; it’s making a significant impact with its innovative solutions, particularly in interoperability and decentralized privacy. Let’s explore why Qubetics deserves your attention. Solving Blockchain’s Interoperability Challenge What is Interoperability? Interoperability refers to the ability of different blockchain networks to communicate and work together seamlessly. In today’s blockchain world, without this capability, users are left within isolated ecosystems that have limited functionality and cause friction between platforms. Qubetics’ Cross-Chain Protocol: Qubetics is addressing this major issue by offering a cross-chain interoperability protocol. This protocol enables different blockchains, whether Ethereum-based or others, to work together effortlessly. Why It Matters: This makes it easier for businesses, professionals, and individuals to operate across multiple blockchain systems without the usual barriers. Whether it’s integrating decentralized apps (dApps) or leveraging blockchain solutions for various use cases, Qubetics is paving the way for greater efficiency in the ecosystem. Decentralized VPN (dVPN): The Future of Online Privacy One of Qubetics’ most exciting features is its decentralized VPN (dVPN). In a world where data privacy and security are top concerns, Qubetics offers a solution that eliminates the need to trust centralized VPN providers. Unlike traditional VPNs that rely on centralized servers, Qubetics’ decentralized VPN means there’s no single point of failure, offering a much higher level of security and privacy. For businesses, this service ensures that sensitive data remains protected, while individuals can enjoy a safe online experience, free from surveillance or hacking threats. Qubetics’ Strong Growth and Community Support Ongoing crypto Presale Success: As of now, Qubetics is in its 26th presale stage, having raised over $15 million from more than 23,000 holders. The presale has sold over 499 million tokens, demonstrating strong community support and investor interest. Attractive Investment Opportunity: With the presale price of $0.1181 per $TICS token, Qubetics offers an exciting entry point for those looking to invest before the project’s mainnet launch. AAVE: Decentralized Finance for the People Another project that has consistently been a top choice for anyone looking to buy the best coins today is AAVE. When you think of decentralized finance (DeFi), AAVE should be at the top of your list. AAVE is one of the most well-known protocols in the DeFi space, offering decentralized lending and borrowing services. It allows users to lend their assets to earn interest or borrow assets with no middleman involved, all while utilizing smart contracts to ensure security and transparency. AAVE is unique because of its flash loans—unsecured loans that must be paid back within the same transaction block. This innovative feature enables users to access liquidity without needing collateral, making it a game-changer for traders and developers looking to access capital quickly. These flash loans have helped AAVE build a strong reputation as a protocol that caters to both seasoned crypto enthusiasts and newcomers alike. Ethereum: The Backbone of Decentralized Applications and Smart Contracts It’s impossible to talk about the best coins to buy today without mentioning Ethereum. Ethereum has been the cornerstone of the blockchain ecosystem for years, and its role is only becoming more critical with the ongoing Ethereum 2.0 upgrade. Ethereum 2.0 aims to solve some of the major issues faced by Ethereum’s original version, including scalability, energy efficiency, and transaction costs. The transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) will reduce energy consumption by over 99%, addressing one of the biggest concerns surrounding Ethereum’s environmental impact. One of Ethereum’s most powerful features is its ability to support smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). This has made Ethereum the go-to platform for developers looking to build decentralized solutions in areas like DeFi, gaming, and NFTs. The Ethereum ecosystem is massive, and its dominance in the blockchain space is unlikely to fade any time soon. Conclusion: Why Qubetics, AAVE, and Ethereum Are the Best Coins to Buy Today When considering the best coins to buy today, it’s clear that Qubetics , AAVE, and Ethereum are leading the charge. Whether you’re looking for innovative interoperability solutions, a DeFi protocol that makes borrowing and lending easier, or a blockchain that powers decentralized applications, these three coins have it all. Qubetics offers an exciting opportunity with its cross-chain interoperability and decentralized VPN, while AAVE continues to redefine decentralized finance with its cutting-edge features. Ethereum remains the backbone of the blockchain industry and is poised for even greater success with Ethereum 2.0. These projects are not just about the present—they are about shaping the future of blockchain. If you’re looking to get ahead in 2025, these are the best coins to buy today. Don’t miss out on the chance to be a part of the next big wave in crypto!

Some investors capitalize early, while others look back with regret, wishing they had seized the moment. One of the most infamous “missed ICO” stories in crypto history is that of Binance Coin (BNB). Back in its early days, many overlooked its potential, only to watch it surge in value beyond their wildest expectations. But for those who feel they missed out, a new chance is on the horizon— Arctic Pablo Coin is making waves in its presale, and the opportunity it presents is strikingly similar to Binance Coin’s early days. The Numbers Speak: Arctic Pablo Coin’s Explosive ROI Potential Just like early Binance Coin investors, those who jump into Arctic Pablo Coin at this stage have a massive upside ahead. The projected launch price of Arctic Pablo Coin is set at $0.008, meaning early investors could experience an ROI of over 10,694.59%.To put it into perspective: a $500 investment now secures 6,756,520 APC tokens. When Arctic Pablo Coin lists at its launch price, that same investment will be worth a staggering $54,052.16. Those who hesitated during Binance Coin’s ICO watched others become millionaires while they stood on the sidelines. Arctic Pablo Coin offers a chance to rewrite that story. With its booming presale, strong community incentives, and exceptional growth potential, this could be the defining investment of 2025. In short, Arctic Pablo Coin is the top crypto coin to invest in 2025. Binance Coin’s Early Days: The Opportunity That Got Away When Binance Coin launched in July 2017, it was just another exchange token. The initial coin offering (ICO) priced BNB at a mere $0.15 per token. At that time, the market was flooded with new coins, and many investors were skeptical. Some saw Binance Coin as nothing more than an exchange utility token with limited potential. Others simply hesitated, unsure whether it was worth the risk. Fast forward to today, and those early doubts have turned into deep regret. Binance Coin has skyrocketed, reaching an all-time high of over $690. The investors who had the foresight to buy BNB during its ICO have seen astronomical returns. A mere $500 investment in Binance Coin during the ICO would now be worth millions. Hindsight is a cruel teacher. Those who ignored BNB’s early promise have spent years watching its meteoric rise, kicking themselves for not taking the plunge. But in the crypto world, second chances are rare—and Arctic Pablo Coin is shaping up to be the next golden opportunity for those looking to turn back time. Arctic Pablo Coin: The Next Big Crypto Success Story For those who missed out on Binance Coin’s early days, Arctic Pablo Coin is the chance to get in on the ground floor of a high-potential crypto project. The ongoing presale has already caught the attention of savvy investors, and for good reason. Arctic Pablo Coin shines as the top crypto coin with its innovative approach, rewarding community engagement, and an impressive presale performance. Currently, Arctic Pablo Coin is in the Frosty Falls phase (14th stage) of its presale, with tokens priced at $0.000074 each. Over $1.88 million has already been raised, proving that investors are recognizing its potential. But what truly sets Arctic Pablo Coin apart is its robust referral incentives—a system that allows investors to spread the word and earn rewards, ensuring organic and community-driven growth. Why Arctic Pablo Coin’s Presale is Generating Major Hype Timing is everything in crypto, and this meme coin’s presale is a golden opportunity to get in before the masses do. Each presale phase sees an increase in token price, meaning the sooner one invests, the better the entry point. The crypto community is already buzzing about Arctic Pablo Coin’s success, with growing discussions across social platforms. As each phase progresses, demand intensifies, making it crucial for investors to secure their tokens before the next price jump. Those who wait may find themselves paying significantly more as the presale advances. The Perfect Storm: Why Arctic Pablo Coin is Poised for Massive Growth Several key factors contribute to Arctic Pablo Coin’s massive potential: Strong Community Engagement: With referral incentives, Arctic Pablo Coin ensures organic growth and network expansion. Strategic Presale Phases: The structured presale model allows early investors to maximize gains before the public launch. Explosive ROI Potential: A projected 10,694.59% ROI mirrors the kind of success that Binance Coin investors experienced in the past. Low Entry Point: At just $0.000074 per token, Arctic Pablo Coin offers an accessible investment opportunity for those looking to replicate BNB’s early gains. Conclusion: A Second Chance for Those Who Missed Binance Coin’s ICO The crypto market rarely offers second chances, but Arctic Pablo Coin is proving to be an exception. Those who missed out on Binance Coin’s historic rise now have the opportunity to be early adopters of the next potential breakout token. Arctic Pablo Coin shines as the top crypto coin of 2025, giving investors a rare opportunity to enter at a price point that could yield extraordinary returns. With the presale still in progress, the time to act is now. Waiting too long could mean missing out on another life-changing investment, just like Binance Coin. The choice is simple—either seize the opportunity with Arctic Pablo Coin today or watch from the sidelines as another wave of early investors rides it to the top.

Reports suggest that President Donald Trump’s team is eyeing XRP as a key player in building a powerhouse Bitcoin (BTC) reserve. A new proposal submitted to the US SEC suggests that XRP could play a key role in boosting the US financial system. The plan claims that integrating XRP could unlock $1.5 trillion in liquidity, which could then be used to buy Bitcoin. However, this idea faces major regulatory hurdles, and it remains unclear if the government will take it seriously. How XRP Could Free Up Trapped Funds The five page proposal written by Maximilian Staudinger suggests that the US should consider using XRP to free up capital stuck in Nostro accounts. These accounts, used for cross-border transactions, hold about $27 trillion globally, with around $5 trillion belonging to US banks. By using XRP, Staudinger believes that $1.5 trillion could be released and redirected toward Bitcoin purchases. Staudinger also proposes a structured crypto reserve system for the US. He argues that Bitcoin should be at the center, while Solana and Cardano could be used for government applications. However, he insists that XRP is the most important asset for handling financial transactions. Bold Bitcoin Claims Raise Questions One of the more questionable parts of the proposal is the claim that the US could buy 25 million Bitcoin at $60,000 per coin. This is impossible since Bitcoin’s total supply is only 21 million. Still, the proposal argues that using XRP could save the US up to $7.5 billion in transaction fees annually and make government payments, like Social Security and tax refunds, faster and cheaper. Regulatory Challenges Stand in the Way Despite its ambitious plan, the proposal faces a big setback—XRP’s unclear regulatory status. Staudinger urges the SEC to classify XRP as a payment asset instead of a security. He also calls on the Department of Justice to lift restrictions preventing banks from using XRP. To speed things up, he suggests a presidential executive order to bypass regulatory delays. His plan includes two timelines: a standard 24-month rollout with standard regulatory approval, government payments, and bank adoption, or opting for a fast-track 6-12 month timeline using executive orders and Fed mandates for quick XRP integration. While ambitious, the fast-track approach could work given Ripple’s existing global liquidity network. Will This Proposal Go Anywhere? While the idea sounds interesting, independent proposals like this usually don’t gain much traction unless backed by major financial institutions or government officials. Without strong support, this remains a bold idea rather than a plan the US is likely to adopt anytime soon.",News|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,XRP|BTC|REGULATION|FIAT|ADA,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-17 03:04:36

According CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost’s latest market analysis post on X, on Jan. 17, Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) open interest hit a record $33 billion, signaling extreme leverage in the market. However, political uncertainty tied to former U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent actions led to a wave of liquidations. https://twitter.com/darkfost_coc/status/1901368698868473975?s=46&t=nznXkss3debX8JIhNzHmzw Subsequently, nearly $10 billion in open interest vanished between Feb. 20 and Mar. 4. This sharp decline pushed Bitcoin’s 90-day futures open interest change down to -14%, often signaling market resets before price recoveries. Analysts believe that eliminating excessive speculation, these stages provide a more stable basis for future growth. You might also like: “What we’re seeing now is looking just like March 2017”. Analysts explain why Bitcoin could soon recover — or crash harder Bitcoin’s long-term outlook is still optimistic despite the decline. According to economist Timothy Peterson, April and October are usually when Bitcoin experiences the biggest seasonal gains. Peterson’s most recent analysis reveals that Bitcoin might hit new all-time highs before June, with a median target of $126,000. Bitcoin is trading near the low end of its historical seasonal range. Nearly all of Bitcoin's annual performance occurs in 2 months: April and October. It is entirely possible Bitcoin could reach a new all-time high before June. pic.twitter.com/p8upTNAkKH — Timothy Peterson (@nsquaredvalue) March 15, 2025 In addition, his “Lowest Price Forward” model, which estimates a price level that Bitcoin is unlikely to drop below in future trading, indicates that Bitcoin’s price floor has now risen to $69,000, with a 95% chance of holding. Past bull markets have shown that corrections like Bitcoin’s recent 30% pullback often precede strong rebounds. However, not all analysts are fully bullish. Benjamin Cowen, founder of Into The Cryptoverse, warned on a Mar. 15 YouTube stream that Bitcoin’s bull cycle could be in jeopardy if it drops below the 2024 highs, which is in the lower $70,000s. Cowen compares the current cycle to 2017 when Bitcoin retested the prior year’s high. He suggests the bull market might be over if Bitcoin closes in the low $60,000s. Additionally, according to Cowen, holding above $70,000–$73,000 would maintain the market’s structure. Bitcoin may signal a macro lower high later in the year if it drops below this level, which could result in a more bearish outlook by Q3. Bitcoin is still in a crucial consolidation phase , with its current price at $82,900 at the time of press. If past trends hold, this reset could pave the way for another strong rally in the coming months.

Regional news outlets have been busy reporting in recent months on the manifold troubles facing the event, set to be a cashless endeavor and featuring its own so-called “Web3” wallet. A big part of the cashless and the “Web3” promotion of Expo 2025 has been the official wallet app of the event. Wallet users who log-in every month will receive an SBT (“Soulbound Token”) — as well as another non-fungible token (NFT) commemorating the 1970 Osaka World Expo. Expo 2025’s repulsive mascot dressed as Santa Claus drew disapproval from Japanese users of social media platform X. The site notes: “Even before the Expo officially begins, you can join the Expo-related services and events through the ‘Connect Feature’, which is linked to Web3 Wallets and the SBT Digital Passport.” Attendees are also made aware they can pay by mere facial recognition, should they register their biometric data with the wallet. Aside from heavy promotion of cashless payments (indeed, there will be no cash options inside the expo), the expo’s digital wallet, which does not feature the ability to pay with any actually decentralized or private peer-to-peer cryptocurrency, is being leveraged to sell the United Nations’ controversial Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) initiative (one intiative of which is actual insect-food vending machines placed in Japan , to help fight overpopulation and climate change, so-called.). “Earn unique points by participating in various SDGs and the EXPO initiatives, and by exchanging other points!” the wallet’s website states. Cryptopolitan reached out to event organizers regarding event difficulties and the Expo 2025 Digital Wallet, but at time of writing, no response has been received. Cashless Expo 2025’s mascot Myaku-Myaku grosses-out public “No matter how you dress it up, I just can’t stand it.” “Disgusting.” “I’m sorry, but it just looks like a monster to me.” These are just a few of the reactions to the expo’s mascot, “Myaku-Myaku,” on an X post from last November. Japanese X users speculate on Expo 2025 as a potential center for disease. The Japanese portion reads in part (translated): “Do not go near people who went to the Osaka Expo. People who went to the Osaka Expo are infected with a new virus.” Expo 2025’s official website describes the character as “a mysterious creature born from the fusion of cells and water,” elaborating: “The red part represents ‘cells,’ which divide and multiply … [and] the blue part represents ‘pure water,’ which can flow and change shape.” If you think a description of the onomatapoeic Japanese “myaku-myaku” might ease your mind about the character somehow relating to genetic mutation, you might be wrong. The official site clarifies: “Our human DNA, wisdom, technology, history and culture have been passed down “myaku-myaku” (continuously) from generation to generation.” The term, notably, can also mean “pulsating.” Some Japanese are even speculating , controversially, that the Expo’s self-decribed “People’s Living Lab” may be just that: a center of some kind of new disease. Public upset with the expo’s confusing ticketing system and construction Kyodo News reported on March 13 that the projected three-trillion-yen impact (about $20 billion USD) of the expo may fail to be realized due to poor ticket sales and delays in construction. Though the original target was to sell 14 million tickets, as of March 5, the number of tickets sold reportedly stood at a mere 8 million. Hiroyuki Ishige, a leader of the Japan Association for the 2025 World Exposition, acknowledged that the goal was “extremely ambitious.” The ‘Grand Ring’ where Expo 2025 will be held in Osaka, Japan. Source: OBAYASHI CORPORATION/Expo 2025. The late introduction of new ticket types, and reduced prices for season passes added just last month, have some would-be attendees giving up altogether on going, and others demanding refunds . Further complicating preparations are major delays in construction, with the Kyodo report noting only about 20% of “Type A self-built pavilions,” considered to be the main attraction, have been completed. There have also been problems reported with foreign participants not completing interior displays by the suggested March 13 date. For now, Japanese are left to wonder if is there real trouble afoot at the artificial “ Yumeshima ” (roughly translated “Dream Island/Continent”) location.

In a response to a written inquiry from Rep. Cha Gyu-geun of the Democratic Party of Korea on March 16, the BOK opened up about the need for caution when considering Bitcoin as part of the country’s financial assets. This marks the first time the BOK has officially addressed the issue. According to Korea Economic TV, the central bank cited Bitcoin’s extreme price volatility as a major concern. The price of Bitcoin has seen sharp fluctuations recently, soaring to 160 million won in January, before falling to 110 million won. Despite predictions of potential future growth, some experts warn that Bitcoin’s value could drop to zero at any time. The BOK explained that such instability could lead to increased transaction costs when converting Bitcoin into cash, particularly during periods of market turmoil. Additionally, the bank pointed out that Bitcoin does not meet the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) standards for foreign exchange reserves. According to the IMF, foreign exchange reserves must be liquid, marketable, and expressed in a convertible currency with a high credit rating. The Bank of Korea further stated that, to date, no discussions or reviews have taken place regarding Bitcoin’s inclusion in reserves. They said, “There has been no discussion or review of Bitcoin’s inclusion in foreign exchange reserves so far. It is known that some countries, such as the Czech Republic and Brazil, have expressed positive opinions, but the European Central Bank ( ECB ), the Swiss National Bank, and the Japanese government have expressed negative opinions.” This announcement comes amid broader global debates, with U.S. President Donald Trump recently signing an executive order for a strategic Bitcoin stockpile, although this would involve only Bitcoin seized through legal processes, not new federal purchases.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|ASIA|EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-17 03:35:25

Officials from the Korean central bank said in a March 16 response to a written inquiry that they have not looked into a potential Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve, citing high volatility. Responding to a question from Representative Cha Gyu-geun of the National Assembly’s Planning and Finance Committee, central bankers said that they have “neither discussed nor reviewed the possible inclusion of Bitcoin in foreign exchange reserves, adding that “a cautious approach is needed,” according to the Korea Herald. “Bitcoin’s price volatility is very high,” the central bank noted, before adding that “in the case of cryptocurrency market instability, transaction costs to cash out Bitcoins could rise drastically.” Over the past 30 days, Bitcoin prices have swung wildly between $98,000 and $76,000 before settling at current levels of around $83,000 in a 15% decline since Feb. 16, according to CoinGecko. The decision comes amid increasing global discussions on the role of crypto assets in national financial strategies, sparked by US President Donald Trump’s executive order earlier this month establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve and digital asset stockpile. At a seminar on March 6, crypto industry lobbyists, and some members of Korea’s Democratic Party urged the country to integrate Bitcoin into its national reserves and develop a won-backed stablecoin. However, the Bank of Korea emphasized that its foreign exchange reserves must have liquidity and be immediately usable when needed, as well as a credit rating of investment grade or higher, criteria that Bitcoin does not meet, in its opinion. Professor Yang Jun-seok of Catholic University of Korea concurred, stating “it is appropriate for foreign exchange to be held in proportion to the currencies of countries with which we trade,” Professor Kang Tae-soo from the KAIST Graduate School of Finance commented on the US being likely to leverage stablecoins rather than BTC to maintain dollar hegemony before adding, “Whether the IMF will recognize stablecoins as foreign exchange reserves in the future is important.” Related: Democrat lawmaker urges Treasury to cease Trump’s Bitcoin reserve plans Earlier this month, South Korea’s financial regulator examined the Japanese Financial Services Agency’s legislative trend toward crypto assets as it mulls lifting a ban on crypto exchange-traded funds in the country.

While there could be short-term bounces from certain support levels, significant price increases are unlikely for now. Support Levels to Watch Currently, XRP is testing an important support zone between $2.25 and $2.30. As of now, the price is holding steady within this range. If it successfully bounces from here, it could set up a short-term bullish trend. A confirmed bounce could push XRP up toward the next resistance levels between $2.65 and $2.80. However, resistance at $2.50 might slow down the momentum. What If XRP Breaks Support? On the other hand, if XRP fails to hold support and the price falls below $2.25, it would indicate a potential retracement toward the next critical support area, around $1.95 to $2.05. This price action would align with the larger sideways trend XRP has been in for the past several weeks. Looking Ahead: What Could Happen? Looking at the broader picture, XRP is still holding within a sideways range between $1.20 and $2.80. This range suggests the price may experience more choppy and unpredictable movements. While some analysts are hopeful for a breakout, XRP has not shown any clear signs of a strong bullish impulse, particularly as it continues to struggle below major resistance levels. In terms of long-term price targets, if the market starts to show positive momentum, the $5 to $5.65 range could be possible, but this depends heavily on the market maintaining the critical $2 support level. A decisive break below this support could signal a bearish scenario, pushing XRP lower into the support range and possibly leading to a more significant correction.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|ALTCOIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-17 04:09:07

Popular economist Peter Schiff believes that if Nasdaq enters the bear market correcting 40% from the peak, BTC price can collapse all the way to $20K. NASDAQ Decline and Bitcoin Price Correlation Amid the brutal US stock market correction over the last few weeks, the NASDAQ index is down by 12%. Economist Peter Schiff believes that things could turn brutal for BTC if the correction slips further into a bear market. The Bitcoin price shares a historical correlation with Nasdaq. A 12% NASDAQ decline often equates to a 24% drop in Bitcoin, placing it at approximately $65,000. If the NASDAQ continues to drop by 20%, Bitcoin could align at $55,000. However, Schiff added that Nasdaq has historically seen even greater corrections while slipping into the bear market territory. The economist stated that during the Dot-com bubble, the NASDAQ fell nearly 80%, while it declined 55% during the 2008 financial crisis and 30% during the COVID crash in 2020. Considering an average 55% decline, Schiff believes that even a 40% drop in Nasdaq index could push BTC price lower to $20,000. “A drop of this magnitude would likely accelerate Bitcoin’s collapse to much lower levels,” Schiff stated . However, Peter Schiff is not alone in predicting a Bitcoin price crash to such lower levels. Last week, Bloomberg analyst Mike McGlone predicted a BTC crash to $10K , while Gold has been on a very strong upside rally. For the near term, all eyes will be on the upcoming US Fed decision following the cooling US inflation data for the month of February. Traders are positioning themselves for the same with a strong surge in daily trading volumes. Gold’s Negative Correlation With Nasdaq In contrast to Bitcoin, gold has shown a negative correlation with the NASDAQ. Since the NASDAQ peaked on December 16, 2023, gold has risen 13%, demonstrating an inverse relationship. Economist Peter Schiff stated that if the NASDAQ undergoes a 40% decline, gold could soar past $3,800. These gains could further extend if the bear market leads to a significant decline in the US Dollar, says Schiff. At $3,800 gold and $20,000 Bitcoin, Schiff projected Bitcoin’s value in terms of gold would plunge over 85%, challenging Bitcoin’s narrative as a store of value. Schiff Predicts US Might Give Up On Bitcoin Reserve Plans The economist stated that the divergence in the value of Bitcoin price and Gold could challenge the cryptocurrency’s status as “digital gold”. Thus, Peter Schiff believes that this could further push away the governments or ETF investors to hold Bitcoin in reserves. He added that massive selling pressure would make it “impossible” for companies like MicroStrategy to liquidate enough Bitcoin to avoid financial distress. Over the past weekend, Bitcoin and the broader crypto markets haven’t shown much of a movement. As press time, Bitcoin is trading 0.66% down at $83,742 with its daily trading volume up by 79% to more than $23.21 billion.

The dispute, which began under the Biden administration, has raised questions about the future of the cryptocurrency. According to Fox News, the delay in reaching a final agreement is due to Ripple negotiating more favorable terms related to a district court ruling that imposed a $125 million fine on the company. The ruling also included a permanent injunction preventing Ripple from selling XRP tokens to institutional investors. Legal expert Jeremy Hogan suggested that a private settlement with the SEC could bring the lawsuit to an end without the need for a court battle. Hogan stated that if a settlement is reached, the case could be wrapped up in a matter of days, providing much-needed clarity for Ripple and the broader market. This would allow Ripple to move forward, giving institutions the green light to engage with XRP and ushering in a new era for the cryptocurrency. Hogan had previously said, “The only way the case could “be over” soon is if Ripple and the SEC reach a private settlement agreement (which would vary from the judgment), dismiss the appeal, and then simply never take the terms of the settlement agreement back to the trial court to be ratified. This is possible but, assuming the injunction is the sticking point, the SEC would have to agree not to enforce the Court’s injunction.” To my knowledge they never have. I assume it’s a legal requirement but it’s one of those things so built into the process that nobody questions it. — Marc Fagel (@Marc_Fagel) March 15, 2025 However, former SEC lawyer Marc Fagel pointed out that there is no such thing as a “private” settlement with the SEC. All SEC settlements are public and must be reviewed by a court. Fagel added that while it may seem like a routine process, it is legally required for transparency and oversight.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-17 04:54:13

Still, a crypto whale has taken a contrarian stance by raising a leveraged bearish bet on BTC worth millions on Hyperliquid while betting bullish on the MELANIA token. As of writing, the whale held a short position in BTC perpetual futures worth over $445 million, generating an unrealized gain of $1.3 million. The position employed a 40x leverage and a liquidation price of $86,000, according to data source Hyperliquid and Lookonchain . The outsized short anticipating a bitcoin price slide made waves on social media X on Sunday as pseudonymous trader CBB invited other market participants for a consortium of bulls aimed at liquidating the whale. ""11 hours ago, @Cbb0fe publicly formed a team to hunt this whale who shorted $BTC with 40x leverage. Just one hour later, the team was in action, driving $BTC above $84,690 in a short period,"" blockchain sleuth Lookonchain said on X. ""The whale was forced to deposit $5M USDC to increase margin and avoid liquidation. But the hunt ultimately failed,"" Lookonchain added. As of writing, the crypto whale also held a 5x leveraged long position in the MELANIA perpetual futures, anticipating a price rise in the memecoin reportedly marketed by MKT World LLC, a Florida-registered company owned by Melania Trump, the wife of U.S. President Donald Trump. Hyperliquid cheered the whole episode on X, saying the transparency of trading positions on its platform has redefined trading. ""When a whale shorts $450M+ BTC and wants a public audience, it's only possible on Hyperliquid. When headlines say ""Bitcoin Market on Edge,"" they are equating ""Hyperliquid"" with the ""market."" Anyone can photoshop a PNL screenshot. No one can question a Hyperliquid position, just like no one can question a Bitcoin balance. The decentralized future is here,"" Hyperliquid said . The platform was in the news last week after an influential whale executed the so-called ""liquidation arbitrage"" by extracting floating profits, leading to a margin shortage.

Social engineering attacks have also escalated, with hackers breaching Kaito AI’s social media to manipulate token prices and crypto founders being targeted through fake Zoom calls containing malware. Additionally, high-profile security breaches and physical attacks are also becoming more of a problem, especially after the recent armed home invasion of streamer Kaitlyn Siragusa. Fake Crypto Exchange Emails Trick Users The crypto industry is facing a surge in phishing scams targeting users of major exchanges like Coinbase and Gemini. Cybercriminals have been sending fraudulent emails that seem to come from these platforms, instructing users to transition to self-custodial wallets. The emails provide detailed instructions on downloading the legitimate Coinbase Wallet or Gemini's wallet service but include pre-generated recovery phrases that are controlled by scammers. Once users set up wallets using these phrases and transfer their assets, the threat actors can instantly drain their funds. In an attempt to add credibility, the fraudulent emails reference ongoing legal battles. The Coinbase-related scam falsely claims that a court ruling forced the exchange to operate as a registered broker, mandating users to move their assets to self-custodial wallets. It even mentions a class-action lawsuit against Coinbase over unregistered securities sales, although the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently dismissed its case against the exchange on Feb. 27. Similarly, Gemini users have been targeted with emails that refer to a supposed court decision requiring them to migrate to a new wallet. The SEC previously sued Gemini over its Earn program, but the case was also dropped on Feb. 26. Coinbase acknowledged the scam , and warned its users never to trust pre-generated recovery phrases. The company reiterated that it will never send such phrases and urged users to stay vigilant. Gemini has yet to officially respond to the reports. Phishing is still one of the most serious security threats in the crypto industry. Blockchain security firm CertiK’s annual Web3 security report revealed that phishing scams cost users more than $1 billion in 2024 alone, with 296 reported incidents. The issue is not limited to email scams. In fact, cybercriminals have also been targeting crypto founders through sophisticated social engineering tactics. At least three founders recently reported that they narrowly avoided a hacking attempt involving fake Zoom meetings . The attackers posed as potential business partners and, during the call, claimed to have audio issues before sending a link to a new meeting, which contained malware that is designed to steal sensitive information. With the rise of these increasingly deceptive attacks, crypto users and industry leaders are urged to be extra cautious. Kaito AI Hit by Social Media Hack Meanwhile, Kaito AI and its founder Yu Hu recently fell victim to a social media hack on March 15, with hackers taking control of the project's X account to spread false information. The attackers claimed that Kaito wallets were compromised and warned users that their funds were not safe. These posts were part of a broader scheme to manipulate the price of KAITO tokens, as on-chain investigator DeFi Warhol revealed that the hackers opened a short position on KAITO before making the fraudulent announcements. By inducing panic selling, the perpetrators planned to crash the token’s price and profit from the market drop. The Kaito AI team quickly regained control of their social media account and reassured its users that there was no breach of Kaito wallets. The team stated that despite having strong security measures in place, the attack bore similarities to recent incidents involving hacked Twitter accounts. This case adds to the increasing number of social engineering attacks and security breaches that are currently affecting the crypto industry. Several high-profile exploits popped up over the past few months. On Feb. 26, the X account of Pump.fun, a fair launch platform, was hacked by an attacker promoting fraudulent tokens, including a fake governance token named ”Pump.” Blockchain investigator ZackXBT later connected this incident to hacks targeting the Jupiter DAO account and the DogWifCoin X account. In another case, the Alberta Securities Commission issued a warning on March 7 about a crypto scam known as CanCap. The scheme relied on fake news articles and counterfeit endorsements using the images of Canadian politicians to lure victims. By playing on the fears of a trade war between Canada and the United States, scammers claimed that the project had the backing of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to entice investors. Attackers are employing increasingly sophisticated tactics to manipulate markets and defraud investors, making it crucial for users to verify information before making any financial decisions. Four Charged in Home Invasion Targeting Bitcoin Another major security issue plaguing crypto users is burglaries. Four suspects were charged in connection with the violent home invasion of online streamer Kaitlyn Siragusa, who is known as Amouranth. The attack took place on March 2, when several armed people entered her home, held her at gunpoint, and demanded access to her cryptocurrency holdings. Authorities identified two of the suspects as Dylan Nesho Campbell and Bryan Anthony Salazar Guerrero, while the remaining two are minors aged 16 and 17. Each suspect faces charges of aggravated kidnapping and aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon. Siragusa reported that the intruders beat her and tried to coerce her into handing over her private keys. Her husband, who was on speakerphone during the ordeal, realized the severity of the situation and grabbed a handgun while monitoring the invaders' movements through the home's security cameras. The armed men took the phone, believing they could use it to access a crypto app, while Siragusa managed to stall them by leading them around the house in search of a cold storage device. While the intruders were distracted, Siragusa ran upstairs to her husband, who fired three shots at the suspects. One of the rounds may have struck one of the attackers before they fled the scene. Law enforcement arrived shortly after to secure the area and investigate the attempted robbery. The attack was very likely financially motivated, as Siragusa previously shared to her followers that she held around 211 Bitcoin, which was worth more than $20 million in late 2024. 7 gang members arrested in the UK for kidnapping The incident adds to a growing wave of targeted kidnappings and home invasions against cryptocurrency holders. In January of 2025, a UK court sentenced seven gang members involved in the prolonged kidnapping and assault of a crypto investor, who was coerced into transferring funds. That same month, Ledger co-founder David Balland was kidnapped in France and held for ransom before being rescued by authorities.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|BUSINESS|REGULATION|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-17 04:58:26

As the blockchain continues to evolve, its network activity has seen fluctuations, with shifting trends in meme coin trading and growing institutional interest in regulated derivatives. The introduction of Solana futures follows the path set by Bitcoin and Ethereum, potentially paving the way for a SOL ETF as asset managers increasingly seek exposure to the cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, major industry players like FalconX and StoneX are facilitating institutional access to Solana through the first-ever CME Solana futures block trade. Solana Celebrates Five Years: A Look at Its Journey and Future Prospects Solana (SOL), the blockchain known for its speed and scalability, marked its five-year anniversary on Sunday, a major milestone for the network that has grown to become the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Despite recent fluctuations in network activity, Solana continues to position itself as a leading player in the crypto space, with significant developments on the horizon. ”Happy Solana 0 block day to all those who celebrate,” wrote Anatoly Yakovenko, Solana’s co-founder, in a post on X. Several key projects that originated on the Solana blockchain also joined in the celebrations, including Phantom Wallet and the viral meme coin launchpad Pump.fun. Since its launch, Solana has been recognized for its high-speed transactions and low fees, making it a favored blockchain for DeFi projects, NFTs, and meme coins. However, the past five years have not been without challenges, from network outages to regulatory uncertainty and the collapse of FTX, one of its biggest backers. The FTX collapse in November 2022 sent SOL’s price plummeting below $10, shaking investor confidence. However, Solana's resilience was evident, as the network recovered to its 2022 peak price levels before settling at around $127 today. Solana co-founder Raj Gokal previously described this period as a ”crucible moment” for the blockchain, one that tested its durability and commitment to decentralization. Despite celebrating its anniversary, Solana has seen a decline in active users in recent months. The number of active addresses on the network has been dropping since November 2023, and March is expected to record even fewer active users than February. This decline is closely tied to the waning popularity of Pump.fun, a meme coin launchpad that became one of the fastest-growing crypto startups in history. Launched in May 2024, Pump.fun achieved an astonishing $100 million in cumulative revenue in just 217 days. However, recent meme coin scandals, including a political controversy involving the President of Argentina, have caused investor sentiment to shift. As a result, the percentage of tokens ”graduating” from Pump.fun to Solana’s decentralized exchange Raydium dropped to just 0.66% on Saturday, the lowest level since the platform’s early days. This metric serves as a barometer for meme coin trading enthusiasm, and its decline suggests that speculative interest in the sector has cooled off. The Firedancer Upgrade: A Game-Changer for Solana While network activity may be slowing down, Solana's development team is pushing forward with major upgrades aimed at solidifying the blockchain’s long-term scalability. One of the most anticipated updates is the launch of Jump Crypto’s Firedancer, an alternative high-performance validator client that is expected to significantly boost Solana’s speed and resilience. A prototype version of the software, Frankendancer, was launched in September 2023, providing a preview of the benefits that Firedancer could bring. The full rollout of Firedancer is expected in 2025, with key figures in the Solana community—such as Helius co-founder Mert Mumtaz—predicting a launch by the end of Q2. Firedancer will help Solana move closer to its ambitious goal of processing 1 million transactions per second (TPS), further cementing its reputation as one of the fastest blockchains in the industry. By diversifying its validator clients, Solana also aims to reduce its risk of network outages, a problem that has plagued the blockchain in the past. Another major development that could drive demand for Solana is the potential approval of Solana-based ETFs . Several asset management firms have filed applications for ETFs that include SOL, and analysts have identified Solana as one of the most likely cryptocurrencies to receive approval, alongside Litecoin (LTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), and XRP. An ETF approval would be a major milestone for Solana, making it more accessible to institutional investors and potentially leading to a surge in demand. With Ethereum ETFs already gaining traction, Solana’s inclusion in a fund could position it as the next major institutional-friendly crypto asset. Despite recent setbacks in network activity, Solana’s long-term trajectory remains strong. The blockchain has demonstrated resilience in the face of adversity, bouncing back from the FTX collapse and continuing to develop its infrastructure with the Firedancer upgrade. If network adoption stabilizes, and ETF approvals come through, Solana could be positioned for another major price breakout in 2025. However, the meme coin sector’s decline and ongoing regulatory concerns could continue to weigh on short-term sentiment. FalconX Executes First Block Trade for CME Group’s Solana Futures Ahead of Market Launch In related news, digital asset prime broker FalconX has successfully executed the first-ever block trade for CME Group's Solana futures, marking a significant milestone in the regulated trading of SOL derivatives. The trade, conducted with StoneX as a counterparty, came just a day before the official launch of CME Group’s Solana futures contracts, set for March 17. The move is part of FalconX’s broader strategy to enhance institutional participation in Solana’s growing futures market, according to Josh Barkhordar, head of US sales at the firm. CME Group, one of the world's leading derivatives exchanges, introduced Solana futures contracts in late February in response to rising institutional demand. The contracts are structured similarly to Bitcoin and Ethereum futures, which historically served as precursors to ETF approvals by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The new Solana futures contracts come in two sizes: Standard contracts: Representing 500 SOL each Micro contracts: Representing 25 SOL each Both are cash-settled, using the CME CF Solana-Dollar Reference Rate, calculated daily at 4:00 p.m. London time to provide a standardized benchmark for SOL’s US dollar price. With major institutions seeking regulated exposure to Solana, industry experts see this launch as a significant step toward a potential SOL ETF. Following the CME Group's launch of Solana futures, several asset management firms have submitted applications to the SEC for spot Solana ETFs. Among the notable applicants: Franklin Templeton (managing over $1.5 trillion in assets) filed for a SOL ETF in late February 2025. Grayscale, 21Shares, Bitwise, VanEck, and Canary Capital have also entered the race, hoping to bring Solana-based investment products to institutional investors. The move follows the regulatory pattern set by Bitcoin and Ethereum, where futures trading preceded the eventual SEC approval of spot ETFs. Analysts suggest Solana's ETF approval could be a reality in 2025, given the growing institutional interest and the SEC's evolving stance on crypto-based investment products. As a key liquidity provider for CME Group’s crypto derivatives, FalconX has been aggressively expanding its presence in institutional markets. The firm has reported executing over $1.5 trillion in trading volume, covering 400+ tokens for around 600 institutional clients. Recent strategic acquisitions further bolster its footprint: In January 2025, FalconX acquired Arbelos Markets, a derivatives platform specializing in institutional-grade crypto options and futures trading. In February 2024, FalconX partnered with TP ICAP’s Fusion Digital Assets, strengthening its liquidity and data solutions offerings. These moves reinforce FalconX’s role as a leading prime broker for institutions looking to trade regulated digital asset products. The launch of Solana futures comes amid a strong surge in demand for CME’s crypto derivatives offerings. The exchange has reported: 202,000 average daily contracts traded in early 2025, marking a 73% increase year-over-year. 243,600 average open interest contracts, up 55% year-over-year. Over 11,300 unique accounts actively trading crypto derivatives on the platform. Solana Derivatives Trading Booms Amid Market Pullback On centralized crypto exchanges, Solana futures have also experienced a significant increase in trading activity. Data from Coinglass shows: Solana derivatives volume surged 66% to $7.24 billion, reflecting bullish sentiment. Long/short ratios remain above 2, indicating a bias toward long positions despite recent liquidations. $12.29 million in 24-hour liquidations suggest high volatility, as traders navigate Solana’s price fluctuations.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,SOL|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-17 05:00:00

In a recent tweet, Farina stated , “Whales are desperately trying to exit Ethereum. They need liquidity to survive. Expect this capital to flow towards $XRP.” This assertion suggests that large-scale Ethereum holders (“whales”) seek liquidity, potentially redirecting their investments to XRP. Whales are desperately trying to exit Ethereum. They need liquidity to survive. Expect this capital to flow towards $XRP — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) March 15, 2025 Community Reactions The crypto community had mixed reactions to Farina’s statement. Juicy.stack expressed skepticism about abandoning Ethereum in favor of XRP, questioning why anyone would leave Ethereum “to buy the single thing that has actually performed worse over the last 7-8 years.” This sentiment reflects concerns over XRP’s historical price performance compared to Ethereum. Marat took a more critical view of Ethereum’s future, claiming that it was in its final stages, “We are witnessing $ETH taking its last few breaths.” He argued that there was “absolutely no way” Ethereum could reach $4,000 or set a new all-time high, indicating a belief that the asset’s best days are behind it. Sasha countered this perspective by highlighting Ethereum’s strong ecosystem, noting that XRP “doesn’t have a shadow of the ecosystem of dapps” found on Ethereum. He specifically mentioned projects like Ondo and Quant, questioning why they were not built on the XRPL. His remarks emphasize Ethereum’s established role in decentralized applications, a key factor many investors consider when evaluating its long-term viability. These differing opinions underscore the ongoing debate about Ethereum’s position in the market and whether XRP presents a viable alternative. Current Market Overview As of press time, Ethereum is trading at approximately $1,937, experiencing a 0.3% decline over the past 24 hours. This price point is notably below its all-time high of $4,862.10, recorded on November 10, 2021. In contrast, XRP trades at $2.42, reflecting a 2.54% increase over the last 24 hours. The cryptocurrency has shown resilience and growth potential, attracting attention from investors seeking alternatives to Ethereum. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ethereum’s Ecosystem and Future Prospects Despite current market challenges, Ethereum maintains a robust ecosystem, particularly in decentralized finance (DeFi). The platform hosts a multitude of dApps, including notable projects like Ondo and Quant, which contribute to its extensive utility and adoption. This established infrastructure is a critical consideration for investors evaluating long-term prospects. However, some analysts caution about potential risks within the DeFi sector if Ethereum’s price declines significantly. A drop to $1,000 could trigger substantial liquidations and dampen investor interest in DeFi platforms reliant on Ethereum. XRP’s Position and Potential XRP has gained attention due to its unique consensus mechanism and focus on facilitating efficient cross-border payments . Farina has expressed optimism about XRP’s future, suggesting that a price of $20 could be just the beginning for even higher price levels. This perspective aligns with the views of some investors who see XRP as a viable alternative amidst Ethereum’s current market challenges. The cryptocurrency market is characterized by rapid changes and diverse opinions. Edo Farina’s recent comments have sparked discussions about the potential shift of capital from Ethereum to XRP. While Ethereum continues to offer a comprehensive ecosystem with numerous dApps, current market conditions have led some investors to explore alternatives like XRP.

This move allows us to implement additional upgrades to prevent further misuse.” The OKX helpdesk confirmed that the DEX aggregator was temporarily suspended for an “internal review and upgrade” but did not provide a timeline. It added that crypto wallet services will remain available to all customers, but it will “pause new wallet creation in select markets during this time.” Source: OKX On March 11, Bloomberg reported that European Union financial watchdogs were investigating the firm’s DEX aggregator, called OKX Web3, and its wallet services for their alleged role in laundering funds from the Bybit hack. “Over the past few days, we’ve faced targeted media attacks questioning our integrity and operations,” the firm stated in a blog post. It added that it “can’t ignore the fact that these attacks are happening at a time when we are actively fighting against financial crime.” According to Bybit CEO Ben Zhou , nearly $100 million from the $1.5 billion Bybit hack had been laundered through OKX’s Web3 proxy, with a portion of the funds now untraceable. OKX responded on March 11, stating that the “Bloomberg article is misleading,” saying that when Bybit was hacked, OKX reacted in two ways: by freezing associated funds from moving into its CEX, and developing the new hack detection features. Related: Lazarus Group sends 400 ETH to Tornado Cash, deploys new malware OKX stated that the goal is to ensure that explorers properly highlight the actual DEX processing trades “rather than mistakenly identifying our aggregator as the point of trade.” The exchange has already deployed a “hacker address detection system” for its DEX aggregator in addition to a system to track the hacker’s latest addresses and block them on its centralized exchange in real time. “We already rolled out a lot of controls for OKX Web3 to fight with the misuse, including prohibited markets’ IP blocking and real-time black address detection and blocking system,” said OKX CEO Star Xu on March 17. The firm also clarified that the OKX Web3 DEX aggregator is not a custodian of customer assets, adding that its function is to provide access to liquidity across multiple protocols.

While the trend remains highly bearish on the daily chart, it has retraced briefly up following a double-digit gain in the last 72 hours. ATOM has continued to show signs of weakness on the daily timeframe following a consistent roller coaster in the last three months. It appeared to have slowed down a bit following a recent bounce off the $0.39 level. This level marked its lowest price in a year, and from the look of things, more breakdowns are underway as the market structure remains bearish from a short-term perspective. While the next breakdown may trigger more losses, it should signal a bearish extension on the mid-term scale. As seen on the daily chart, the descending trendline has been serving as resistance since last December. If the price manages to break above it, we may a major price retracement before resuming bearish at full speed. Retracing above the peak level should confirm a complete trend reversal. Looking back from where it initiated fall from the peak level of $10.7, ATOM has seen more than 70% loss. This put the crypto among the top loser mid-cap altcoins in the last three months. While there are no signs of a reversal yet, its mid-term bearish momentum may last to $1 before halting. ATOM’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview The key resistance level for a retest right now lies at $4.45. If the price breaks above the descending trendline, the immediate resistance level for an increase is $5.51. Right above it lies the $6.1 resistance. Resuming selling, the weekly $3.39 low is the key support to watch for a breakdown. A new low may come at $3 and probably $2.5 in the future.

This could lead to a major trend shift, but the crypto will likely face resistance anytime soon. Unlike most mid-cap altcoins, Kava recorded less loss during the wide market correction and remained well above the $0.38 level throughout the storm. Though this price marked the crypto’s lowest level in the last four months after losing roughly half of its valuation. However, things might get worse for the crypto in the future as it forms a strong bearish pattern on a short-term scale. While it continues to hold the above price level as support, it has created a series of lower highs on the daily chart. It attempts to create a new one following the latest surge. No doubt, it will likely face rejection at the descending trendline, acting as dynamic resistance for the past four months. Once that happens, we can expect a drop capable of slipping the price back to the mentioned price level, serving as crucial parallel support since the correction began. Inversely, a successful cross above this descending trendline could bring a temporal shift in the trend. It must reclaim last December’s high before confirming a major shift. But as it stands, Kava remains under the bear’s radar despite the latest surge. A drop off the parallel support could cause a catastrophic loss in the future. KAVA’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview Following the latest surge, Kava is targeting the resistance line at $0.51. There is lots of resistance above in case of a break, but close ones to watch are $0.556 and $0.624. Above it lies $0.68. Right now, the $0.446 level is providing support, along with the recent lowest $0.38 level. Losing it could cause a serious collapse to $0.32.

This raised global concern about how safe crypto assets are for bringing them into the mainstream financial zone, as discussed by an influential figure in the EU council. Let’s dive in. ECB’s Villeroy Sounds the Alarm Francois Villeroy de Galhau, a senior member of the European Central Bank’s Governing Council, has voiced strong concerns about the US approach to crypto. In an interview with La Tribune Dimanche, he warned that financial crises often originate in the US and spread globally. By supporting digital assets and non-bank financial systems, the American administration is taking unnecessary risks that could destabilize the global economy. Villeroy assured that Europe’s financial system is well-regulated, minimizing any threat of a banking crisis. He also called for a stronger international role for the euro, urging Europe to build a powerful savings and investment union to attract global capital. Crypto as a Solution, Not a Threat Not everyone agrees with Villeroy. Crypto analyst Christopher Perkins strongly opposes his stance, arguing that digital assets reduce financial risks. He highlights the 1974 Herstatt Bank collapse as a cautionary tale of traditional finance failures. Unlike conventional assets, which take days to settle, crypto transactions occur in real time, improving liquidity and reducing systemic risks. Drawing from his experience during the Lehman Brothers collapse, Perkins stresses that liquidity is everything—and crypto enhances it. He urges Europe to embrace blockchain technology for faster settlements and improved financial security. Trump’s Memecoin Mania Beyond policy changes, Trump has also been linked to the memecoin craze. Reports suggest his family has endorsed unregulated tokens since he took office, using his political influence to pump and dump assets. Many believe he is leveraging the crypto industry to recover his election spending and build personal wealth at the expense of investors. This has drawn comparisons to past economic downturns caused by his financial strategies. Bitcoin Reserve Plan Raises Questions Meanwhile, Trump continues to push pro-crypto policies, including a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a separate digital asset stockpile. His administration has also rolled back several SEC lawsuits against crypto firms. However, analyst Bakcho_Panda highlights a major twist in the Bitcoin Reserve plan—the US is not buying BTC. Instead, it’s selling seized crypto, leading to speculation that the reserve grows only when more assets are confiscated. This raises concerns that the government may use crypto crackdowns to expand its holdings while presenting itself as a supporter of digital assets.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,FIAT|BTC|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-17 05:16:54

This includes an additional civil penalty of almost $221,500. The CFTC has proven that Debiex was faking itself as a crypto platform. On March 13th, Judge Douglas granted the CFTC’s motion for summary judgment. Douglas said Debliex did not respond to the CFTC’s claims, and there’s no evidence that it was just “excusable neglect.” CFTC filed a legal case against Debiex in January last year. It sued the platform for running a “pig butchering scam.” The scam involved scammers developing fake romantic relationships with customers on social media, after which the customers were lured into investing in the bogus platform. The platform scam-baited 5 victims. These victims made deposits of a total of $2.3 million on Debiex. Zhāng Chéng Yáng was a “money mule” for Debiex, according to CFTC. This is because his wallet was used to receive the stolen funds from the victims. On March 12, Judge Rayes approved a legal request (motion for default judgment) from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) against Zhāng. He accepted CFTC’s claims that Zhāng controlled the OKX crypto wallet “that received digital assets to which he had no legitimate claim.” The judge found that OKX was “voluntarily preserving” the funds in Zhāng’s wallet. The wallet contained $5.70 worth of USTD and up to 63 ETH, which amounted to $119,500 in total. The judge has ordered the transfer of these funds back to an unnamed victim’s account. Debiex reportedly hired female staff pretending to be successful traders CFTC claims that scammers directed the victims toward Debiex websites through social media. The platform marketed itself as a “Blockchain Network Decentralized perpetual contract trading platform.” Customers were lured under the pretense of “mining transactions” and futures trading. The details shared by CFTC state that Debiex staff consisted of women who would contact victims through “continuous and repeated messaging and sharing purported pictures of themselves.” These women portrayed themselves as “highly successful digital asset commodities traders.” According to the CFTC, once a victim created an account on Debiex’s platform and sent their cryptocurrency as a so-called investment, the platform would lie to them about the performance of their funds. This “fictitious information” was based on customer balances, profits, and trading positions. CFTC said, “All of this information was most likely false” and proved that customers’ digital assets were instead transferred to “numerous digital asset wallets in an attempt to obfuscate their destination.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

This move signals a change from its previous skepticism, where digital assets were seen as a financial risk due to their potential use in illicit activities. Now, with over 20 million active crypto users and a booming digital economy, Pakistan is embracing blockchain technology to regulate and integrate it into its financial system. Pakistan establishes Crypto Council to regulate digital assets The finance chief highlighted Pakistan’s commitment to building a regulated and responsible crypto ecosystem, integrating blockchain innovations to boost economic growth. pic.twitter.com/PqfH5bmVxe — PEconomist (@peconomist_) March 16, 2025 A Strategic Shift Toward Blockchain Pakistan’s decision to create the PCC is a big change from its earlier view that crypto was a security risk. With this new council, the country now wants to be a strong player in the global digital finance space. This comes at a key moment, as more countries are realizing the benefits of blockchain technology, and even the U.S. has set up a special Bitcoin reserve. Who’s Leading the Charge? Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb will chair the PCC, bringing together top regulatory figures, including the Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan and the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP). This high-level leadership structure ensures that blockchain integration is approached with financial stability, security, and compliance in mind. The development comes a week after the government appointed Bilal bin Saqib as the Chief Advisor to the Finance Minister for the PCC. As the council’s CEO, he has emphasized that the PCC will not just regulate but also support the growth of blockchain and digital finance in Pakistan. Why is it Necessary? The Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) has been set up to create clear rules for using cryptocurrency in the country. Its main job is to make sure crypto adoption is safe, organized, and beneficial for the economy. To do this, the council will work with international blockchain groups, learn from their experiences, and build a strong legal system that protects users from fraud or misuse. One of the biggest reasons Pakistan is embracing crypto is its huge remittance market. Every year, Pakistanis living abroad send home around $35 billion. Right now, sending money internationally can be slow and expensive, with banks and other services charging high fees. Crypto can change this by making transactions faster, cheaper, and more efficient, allowing families to receive more money with fewer deductions. This move shows that Pakistan isn’t just trying to control crypto—it wants to become an important player in the global digital economy. If the PCC successfully puts its plans into action, Pakistan could see major advancements in blockchain technology, digital finance, and economic growth. The next few months will be crucial in determining how well this council can turn its vision into reality.",News|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|TECHNOLOGY|FIAT|BTC|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-17 05:24:39

Term Structure Institutional (TSI) is at the forefront of this transformation, offering a cutting-edge fixed-rate borrowing and lending platform designed to meet the needs of institutional investors. With a robust foundation built on Fireblocks’ industry-leading Multi-Party Computation (MPC) technology and as an advanced Electronic Communication Network (ECN), TSI eliminates the risks of volatile lending and borrowing markets, providing institutions with seamless access to fixed-income opportunities in the digital asset space. Addressing Key Challenges in Institutional Digital Asset Lending and Borrowing Despite the rapid growth of digital asset markets, institutional participants continue to face significant barriers: Unpredictable Borrowing Costs – Open-term loans expose institutions to fluctuating interest rates, making financial planning challenging. Security Concerns – The on-chain DeFi ecosystem is prone to hacks and vulnerabilities, deterring institutional involvement.

Over the years, it has become one of the most active blockchain networks by transaction volume and is among the few cryptocurrencies proposed for inclusion in a US digital asset reserve. Since the first Solana block was built on March 16, 2020, the network has processed more than 408 billion transactions and nearly $1 trillion worth of value on decentralized exchanges — establishing itself as one of the industry’s leading layer-1 blockchains. Source: Solana Here are some of the Solana ecosystem’s most notable milestones since it was launched by Solana Labs CEO Anatoly Yakovenko and Solana co-founder Raj Gokal to the public in 2020. Solana was born just as the COVID-19 pandemic hit While Solana’s origins can be traced back to late 2017 when Yakovenko released a white paper outlining a timekeeping method for blockchains called “Proof of History,” but Solana wasn’t launched until March 2020 — right as the world started to enact emergency measures against the COVID-19 pandemic. The high-speed, low-cost layer 1 Solana blockchain launch was assisted by crypto-focused venture capital firm Multicoin Capital, leading a financing round for Solana, which brought in roughly $20 million worth of private token sales in July 2019. Source: OKX Additional funding poured in soon after, and within 20 months of launching, Solana was hailed as a potential “Ethereum killer” as it soared to a $77.8 billion market cap at the peak of the 2020-2021 bull cycle. Solana hit hard by 2022 bear market, FTX collapse — but bounced back The 2022 bear market, coupled with the catastrophic collapse of crypto exchange FTX , tanked Solana’s market cap to $3 billion — a whopping 96% fall from its previous peak — by late 2022. Sam Bankman-Fried’s former firm purchased around 58 million Solana tokens — currently worth $7.4 billion — from Solana Labs and the Solana Foundation. Solana was “by far the most serious” layer 1 that FTX was helping scale, Fortune said in an April 2022 report. FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Nov. 11, 2022, and is still in the process of unlocking hundreds of millions of dollars worth of staked Solana tokens from FTX’s wallets. Solana’s price fell to $8.30 on Dec. 29, 2022. Despite the setback, 2023 marked the start of Solana's impressive comeback, which saw its market cap rise nearly 50-fold from $3 billion to over $140 billion by Jan. 19, 2025. Memecoin craze takes Solana adoption to the next level One of the biggest reasons behind Solana’s comeback was the crypto memecoin craze that took place between late 2023 and 2024 — a $100 billion market that Solana dominated. Several Solana memecoins such as Bonk ( BONK ), Dogwifhat ( WIF ), Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) and Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) rose to multibillion-dollar market caps in early 2024 — around the time Solana memecoin launchpad Pump.fun became one of the most popular crypto platforms for memecoin lovers. Pump.fun alone has raked in over $540 million in revenue over the last 12 months and even surpassed Ethereum over 24-hour intervals at some points. Solana is home to many of the largest memecoins by market cap. Source: CoinGecko No Solana memecoin, however, drew more attention than the Official Trump (TRUMP) token launched by now-US President Donald Trump’s inner circle on Jan. 17 — which soared to a $14.6 billion market within two days before it came crashing down. The TRUMP memecoin briefly pushed Solana decentralized finance (DeFi) total value locked to $14.2 billion, trailing only Ethereum, DefiLlama data shows. happy 5th birthday @solana 🥳 congratulations on 5 years of building & shipping the greatest tech to ever grace our industry 🫶 manlets on top 🎉 pic.twitter.com/Clkv3eEpn9 — pump.fun (@pumpdotfun) March 16, 2025 The Solana blockchain has also become the third largest adopter of stablecoins behind Ethereum and Tron. Solana unveils the first major crypto phone In May 2023, Solana released the first major crypto phone, called “Solana Saga.” Sales for the Android device with the built-in crypto wallet started slow but skyrocketed after a 30 million BONK airdrop enticed memecoin enthusiasts to make a purchase. Solana also unveiled a newer, shinier Solana “Seeker” smartphone last September to better facilitate memecoin trading and accrue token rewards. While most reviewers say the Solana phones lack the technical capabilities of an iPhone or Google Pixel, Solana has seen over 140,000 presales for the two products. The Solana Seeker phone is currently priced at $500. Hardware specifications of the Solana Seeker phone. Source: Solana Mobile Solana, however, has also been plagued with several network outages over its five-year span — halting block production for 20 hours in some instances. Solana validators have been forced to restart the network on several occasions when network activity surged. A new independent validator client called Firedancer is scheduled to go live on Solana’s mainnet sometime in 2025 to address Solana’s client diversity woes. It has been touted as a superior solution to “QUIC” — a Google-developed data transfer protocol that has failed to process transactions on Solana over a dozen times. Solana set to be included in Trump’s Digital Asset Stockpile The Trump administration says it will include Solana in the Digital Asset Stockpile, which it confirmed through an executive order on March 7. It is the youngest cryptocurrency on the list. The Digital Asset Stockpile will initially use cryptocurrency forfeited in government criminal cases. Related: Solana proposal to cut inflation rate by up to 80% fails to pass The US doesn’t appear to hold Solana, according to crypto analytics firm Arkham Intelligence. However, the White House said it would complete an audit of crypto asset holdings. Trump initially announced that Solana would become a US reserve asset on March 2. Source: Donald Trump However, he later established a Bitcoin-only reserve and the Digital Asset Stockpile, which looks like it will include Solana in addition to Ether ( ETH ), XRP ( XRP ) and Cardano ( ADA ). Solana is currently priced at $128.17 — the sixth-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $64.5 billion. Solana is down 56% from its all-time high as the broader market continues to navigate through recession fears and weakened market sentiment of late.

Amidst all this volatility, one Shiba Inu trader has raised the alarm, predicting a staggering 7900% surge for a rival token priced at under 20 cents—potentially reaching $16 within a time frame that is turning skeptics into wholehearted believers. Let us find out why analysts and investors agree. Shiba Inu Price Undergoes A Meme Coin Reality Check Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains a crypto legend, but the glitz is thinning out in 2025. The token on March 13 stands at $0.0000128 , tumbling hard from its January high of $0.000042—an over 40% plunge that has been fueled by a 6% fall in just the last 2 weeks alone. In ecosystem developments, Shibarium’s 24-hour transactions surged to nearly 2,000%, which signifies new interest in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and maybe a turn around in prices. The movement signifies growing traction in the network after a session of low activity levels. The Shiba Inu price narrative is marred by stuck ecosystem projects. Integration with NFT and updates to ShibaSwap haven’t done much to shake the boat, and the token’s destiny continues to ride in lockstep with Bitcoin. Analysts at Coincodex have a mixture of bullish and bearish Shiba Inu price predictions at a projected high of $0.000025 by late March, but a significant decline to $0.000011 in the next 3 months unless some gigantic event happens. Remittix (RTX): The PayFi Visionary Redefining Crypto Wealth Remittix (RTX) is entering the scene as a PayFi trailblazer ready to redefine cross-border finance. Unlike hype-based meme coins, Remittix utilizes blockchain to facilitate instant , affordable transactions with added security, combining decentralized finance and real-world FIAT transaction settlements. This combination facilitates a smooth on-ramp and off-ramp between digital and fiat markets, offering a platform that is greater than a currency but a financial revolution in the making. Remittix’s presale outcomes have been nothing short of incredible. At $0.0734 per token, it has raised close to $13.9 million in its phases, with momentum picking up. Daily token sales are gaining pace, a testament to investor enthusiasm for a project promising to run transactions at a fraction of conventional expense. Many Shiba Inu price analysts are buzzing, predicting a $16 valuation in Q4 2025—a 7900% gain that could turn a modest investment into a fortune in a few months. Remittix is better compared to Shiba Inu. SHIB’s over 40% decline YoY highlights its hype dependence, whereas RTX’s rise hinges on a PayFi model delivering real utility. Shiba Inu’s once booming community is fizzling, whereas that of Remittix is rallying around a cause of revolution. Being Late To Remittix New ICO Is Dangerous Play; Analysts Warn The crypto trend is evolving, and Remittix is surfing the wave. With presale inching towards conclusion and currently at $0.0734 per token, the chance to be part of a 7900% potential project by the end of 2025 is fast approaching. It’s not a gamble on viral phenomena—it’s an intelligent investment in a PayFi pioneer set to revolutionize global finance. Go to the Remittix Website today and secure your presale tokens and get ahead in a wealth-growth opportunity that has an impact in the real world. Don’t let this moment pass.

41792106,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=140555,1742189727,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,The Bitcoin Prophecy: Josh Mandell’s Bold $444K Price Prediction,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-prophecy-josh-mandell-444k/,"Introduction: The Bitcoin Prophecy of 2024 Exactly 132 days ago , a bold Bitcoin prophecy was made. On November 5, 2024 , Josh Mandell , a former Wall Street trader , publicly called his shot when Bitcoin was trading at $74K . His prophecy, cryptic yet poetic, hinted at a massive Bitcoin rally —potentially reaching $444,000 per BTC . Could this prophecy come true? What do the mysterious dates mean? How accurate has Mandell been so far? Let’s break down the prophecy and what it could mean for Bitcoin’s price action this cycle. Who is Josh Mandell? Josh Mandell isn’t just another crypto influencer—he’s a seasoned trader with a deep background in traditional finance . His Credentials: Salomon Brothers (1990-1998): The legendary trading firm from Liar’s Poker . Caxton Associates: One of the most prestigious hedge funds. Bitcoin & MSTR Trader: Actively trading and sharing insights publicly. Unlike many anonymous Bitcoin forecasters, Mandell’s track record and experience give credibility to his market insights. Why Should You Trust His Bitcoin Judgment? As Bitcoiners say: “Don’t trust, verify.” Josh Mandell has been publicly trading Bitcoin and MicroStrategy (MSTR) for over a year. His trades and analysis are available for scrutiny, and he initially seeded his portfolio with $2.1 million . While no one can predict Bitcoin’s price with certainty, his background in macro trading and market cycles makes his call worth considering. The Prophecy: A Breakdown On November 5, 2024 , Josh Mandell made The Prophecy , predicting a major Bitcoin price movement. Let’s analyze the key elements of his message: “When $84K becomes the base…” Suggests that Bitcoin would stabilize above $84,000 before making its next major move. So far, Bitcoin has traded above $84K for some time , validating this part of the call. “360 more … A trio of fours, times a grand.” This cryptic phrase seems to imply a move from $84K to $444K ( three fours, times $1,000 ). In other words, he sees $444K as Bitcoin’s potential peak this cycle . Decoding the Important Dates Josh’s prophecy mentioned three key dates : November 7, 2024: Bitcoin was trading at $74K and was on the verge of breaking out. January 16, 2025: A critical point in the cycle. (Did Bitcoin confirm a new uptrend?) March 14, 2025: A major event or price action shift is expected. So far, Bitcoin has followed a strong uptrend since his initial call, adding credibility to his forecast. Could Bitcoin Really Reach $444K? A $444,000 Bitcoin price sounds ambitious, but it’s not entirely impossible. Here’s how it could happen: Bitcoin’s 4-Year Cycle Pattern – Historically, Bitcoin sees parabolic moves after each halving. A peak near $400K+ would align with past cycle expansions. Institutional Demand – ETFs and large funds are accumulating BTC at record rates . Supply shock + demand surge could drive prices exponentially higher . Global Liquidity Trends – Central banks are pivoting back to easy monetary policy , fueling risk-on assets like Bitcoin. If Bitcoin follows its historical post-halving trend , a peak near $400K-$500K isn’t out of the question . What If The Prophecy Fails? Even the best traders aren’t right 100% of the time . If Bitcoin doesn’t reach $444K, it doesn’t mean the prophecy was worthless. It could simply mean: Bitcoin peaks at a lower target (e.g., $250K or $300K). The cycle extends longer than expected (into late 2025 or 2026). Macroeconomic factors (recession, regulations) slow Bitcoin’s growth. Regardless of the exact target, Josh Mandell’s insight suggests Bitcoin’s uptrend is far from over . Final Thoughts: Is This the Cycle of $444K? Josh Mandell’s Bitcoin prophecy is one of the boldest price calls this cycle . His $84K base call has already played out. Key cycle dates have aligned with major moves. The possibility of $444K BTC remains open. What do YOU think? Will Bitcoin reach $444K this cycle? Or is this prophecy too ambitious? Conclusion: The Bitcoin Prophecy Unfolds Josh Mandell’s Bitcoin prophecy is still in motion . $84K base? Confirmed. Next major target? $444K. Will it happen? Time will tell. Regardless of the exact price, Mandell’s call reinforces the massive upside potential of Bitcoin this cycle . Will Bitcoin make history again? Stay tuned.",Crypto News|Press Release|bitcoin price prediction|Bitcoin prophecy|Josh Mandell Bitcoin forecast,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoin World', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinworld,2025-03-17 05:35:27
41792140,https://coinpedia.org/?p=432340,1742189791,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,North Korea’s $1.14 Billion Bitcoin Stash Puts It Among the Top 3 Government Holders,https://coinpedia.org/news/lazarus-groups-1-4b-crypto-heist-fuels-north-koreas-bitcoin-reserves/,"The post North Korea’s $1.14 Billion Bitcoin Stash Puts It Among the Top 3 Government Holders appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News North Korea has quietly climbed the ranks to become one of the largest government holders of Bitcoin, surpassing even crypto-friendly nations like El Salvador and Bhutan. This is a major concern for crypto investors as Bitcoin in weak hands can raise the concern of liquidity, followed by a massive market crash if they try to sell these crypto assets to manage their countries’ financial position. The surge comes after the Lazarus Group—a state-backed hacking syndicate—pulled off a massive cyber heist, stealing over $1.4 billion in crypto from Bybit on February 21, 2025. A large portion of the loot, initially in Ethereum, was later converted into Bitcoin, swelling North Korea’s holdings to 13,562 BTC, valued at over $1.14 billion. The U.S. and North Korea: A Tale of Two BTC Strategies While North Korea has been quietly stacking Bitcoin through illicit means, the U.S. is taking a more structured approach. President Trump’s Executive Order on March 6, 2025, officially launched the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR), positioning the U.S. as the largest government Bitcoin holder with 198,109 BTC worth a staggering $16.71 billion. As per Arkham data , the U.K., sitting in second place with 61,245 BTC ($5.17 billion), has accumulated its stash through criminal seizures rather than direct accumulation. Meanwhile, Bhutan’s Druk Holdings manages 10,635 BTC ($897.6 million), and El Salvador, one of the first nations to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, holds 6,117 BTC ($516.11 million). Is Kim Jong Un Playing the Digital Gold Game? The timing of North Korea’s Bitcoin accumulation—coinciding with the U.S. unveiling its SBR—raises eyebrows. There is a growing possibility that Kim Jong Un is making a strategic play in the digital asset space, using stolen Bitcoin as a shadow reserve. Unlike traditional reserves of gold or fiat currency, Bitcoin offers a decentralized and censorship-resistant alternative, allowing nations to store wealth outside of global financial oversight. For North Korea, this is particularly advantageous, as sanctions have long restricted its access to international banking systems. By accumulating Bitcoin, Pyongyang secures an asset that can be used for global transactions without relying on the dollar-based financial network. While the U.S. frames its reserve as a financial strategy, North Korea’s BTC buildup appears to be a silent power move, blurring the lines between cybercrime and state policy. This marks a new phase in the geopolitical power struggle, where digital assets play a key role in economic and strategic dominance. Crypto Reaction is Negative The crypto space is fearing North Korea’s bitcoin gamble; many call their illegal Bitcoin holdings a political move to put pressure on the US government. The digital gold rush isn’t just about investment, it’s a geopolitical chess match. — Elize Millard (@ElizeMillard) March 16, 2025 Others are looking forward to the US taking action before other countries take control.

The exchange made the announcement on Mar.17, citing security issues and the need to fix incomplete tagging on blockchain explorers. According to their official statement, the suspension will allow OKX DEX aggregator to roll out new security measures to prevent further misuse. “Recently, we detected a coordinated effort by Lazarus Group to misuse our DeFi services. At the same time, we’ve noticed an increase in competitive attacks aiming to undermine our work,” OKX stated in its blog post. The exchange added that it consulted regulators before taking this step. We are temporarily pausing our DEX aggregator to address incomplete tagging on blockchain explorers while we also roll out new security features. This is to address the recent coordinated attacks by media along with unsuccessful efforts by Lazarus group to misuse our DeFi… pic.twitter.com/r6oHNIaalT — OKX (@okx) March 17, 2025 While the DEX aggregator is paused, wallet services remain available, though new wallet creation is temporarily restricted in select markets. OKX has already implemented a number of security improvements, such as real-time tracking to stop malicious addresses in its centralized exchange and a hacker address detection system for its web3 DEX aggregator.

Despite the temporary suspension, OKX stressed that its web3 service is only a DEX aggregator and not a custodian of user assets. The exchange is further strengthening its security by implementing real-time tracking systems to identify and block hacker addresses. The Lazarus Group has been linked to multiple cyberattacks targeting cryptocurrency platforms, including the Feb. 21 $1.5 billion Bybit hack . In their latest wave of attacks targetting developers, the group has deployed six new malware packages on the Node Package Manager platform to steal credentials and wallet data. The hackers have also been using fake Zoom calls to trick crypto founders into downloading malicious software. Over $1.3 billion worth of cryptocurrency was stolen by North Korean hackers in 47 attacks in 2024, more than doubling the amount stolen the year before, according to Chainalysis.

He has to assure investors that the economy is strong while making it clear that the Federal Reserve is ready to cut interest rates if things start going south. The timing is brutal. Stocks have been unstable, bond yields are down, and the White House isn’t exactly helping. His message has to be precise—too much confidence and markets panic, too little and the sell-off deepens. The Fed is expected to keep interest rates steady when officials meet on March 18-19. But traders are betting on three rate cuts this year, starting in June. Economists are calling for two. If Powell signals only two, he’ll need to stress the Fed’s willingness to act fast if the job market shows signs of cracking. “At the margin, the Fed could make it slightly better or slightly worse,” said James Athey, portfolio manager at Marlborough Investment Management. “But clearly they can’t completely calm markets because the hit to sentiment has come largely from the White House.” Fed faces pressure as markets react to Trump’s economic policies Donald Trump has made things worse. The president’s trade war escalated fast, and the market is feeling it. Stocks have been in a free fall for the past month. Treasury yields are dropping. Consumer sentiment is down. The White House hasn’t stepped in to reassure anyone. Instead, Trump said on March 9 that the economy is in a “period of transition.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent doubled down, saying the markets are in need of a “detox.” None of that helped investors. Market volatility is already affecting Fed decisions. The two-year Treasury yield, which reacts the fastest to monetary policy shifts, has dropped nearly 60 basis points since January. It hit 3.83% this month, the lowest level in over five months. The S&P 500 is down 10% from its peak. The VIX, which measures market fear, hit its highest level since August. That’s the backdrop for Powell this week. He can’t ignore it. “Powell needs to give some sort of a signal that they’re watching it,” said Dominic Konstam, head of macro strategy at Mizuho Securities USA. The Fed doesn’t react to the stock market directly, but it can’t pretend this isn’t happening. Economic projections coming out this week are expected to show slower growth for 2025 and slightly higher core inflation, which removes food and energy costs. That makes the Fed’s job even harder. Inflation makes rate cuts complicated Inflation is still a problem. Consumer prices slowed in February. Producer prices didn’t move at all. But the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which the Fed watches closely, is still firm. Long-term inflation expectations have now climbed for three straight months, hitting a 30-year high. That’s why Powell can’t just promise rate cuts. “We’ll hear the message that things are still holding up and that policy is in a good place,” said Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo. She wants clarity on how the Fed is balancing inflation risks against a slowing economy. Matthew Luzzetti, chief US economist at Deutsche Bank, says the Fed will wait before moving rates. “There’s lots of uncertainty that’s out there,” he said . “They are going to be in a wait-and-see mode.” He doesn’t expect rate cuts this year but acknowledges that the inflation fight isn’t over. If the economy slows while inflation stays high, most economists expect the Fed to keep rates steady. But they’re also watching Trump’s other policies. Tax cuts and deregulation could push growth and inflation even higher, forcing the Fed to rethink its strategy. Powell and other officials are waiting to see the full impact before making a move. “Despite elevated levels of uncertainty, the US economy continues to be in a good place,” Powell said earlier this month in New York. “We do not need to be in a hurry and are well positioned to wait for greater clarity.” Fed’s balance sheet and Trump’s trade war add to uncertainty Investors are also looking for clues about the Fed’s balance sheet. Officials have been reducing it, a process called quantitative tightening (QT). Minutes from the Fed’s January meeting show that they’ve discussed slowing or pausing QT, especially since lawmakers haven’t reached a deal on the debt ceiling. “The argument for March is that the Fed has already talked about it,” said Blake Gwinn, head of US rates strategy at RBC Capital Markets. “So why not just do it? They can pause QT and restart it later.” A Bloomberg News survey shows most economists expect the Fed to keep rates steady through mid-2025, with two cuts in September and December. That’s a shift. Back in December, they expected three cuts starting in March. The change reflects uncertainty around Trump’s trade policies. The president has threatened tariffs against China, Canada, and Mexico. He’s also changed his stance multiple times, making it impossible for markets to price in risk. Investors don’t know what’s coming next, and that’s creating instability. “The Fed is in a very tough spot right now, facing a more stagflationary outlook even as core inflation remains well above its medium-term target,” said Scott Anderson, chief US economist at BMO Capital Markets. “Uncertainty around the magnitude, duration, and targets of future tariffs further complicates the monetary policy outlook.” Most economists don’t expect big changes to the Fed’s post-meeting statement. But some see the possibility of a slowdown in QT. Around 11% predict the Fed will ease up next week. Another 41% think that will happen in the second quarter. Trump’s policies could force the Fed to act sooner Looking ahead, the big question is how the Fed will react if inflation stays high while the economy slows. Nearly three-quarters of economists surveyed said they now expect weaker growth in 2025 due to Trump’s policies. Two-thirds now predict higher inflation. So far, Fed officials haven’t said much about how Trump’s policies will influence their decisions. They remain optimistic about the labor market but acknowledge inflation concerns. “The costs of being cautious are very, very low,” Powell said this month. “The economy’s fine. It doesn’t need us to do anything, really, and so we can wait and we should wait.” Most economists believe the Fed will hold rates steady if inflation remains high while growth slows. But if conditions worsen, some expect cuts to come sooner. “If our downside scenario plays out, the Fed will have to shift to focus on growth risks and could start to cut rates by Q3,” said Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide. She sees the first cut happening in October. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

The wild world of memecoins has delivered another rollercoaster ride, and this time, it’s a dizzying plunge. Just days ago, the crypto sphere was buzzing about a new token, WOLF of Wall St (WOLF), linked to none other than Hayden Davis, the co-creator of the infamous LIBRA project. But the initial excitement quickly turned to dismay as WOLF experienced a shocking memecoin crash , losing a staggering 99% of its value soon after launch. Let’s dive into the details of this dramatic crypto event and explore what it means for the volatile world of digital currencies. What Triggered the WOLF Token Memecoin Crash? According to reports from The Block, citing data from blockchain analytics platform Bubblemaps, the WOLF token saw its market capitalization briefly soar to nearly $43 million after its release on March 8th. However, this peak was incredibly short-lived. Almost immediately after reaching this high, the token began a rapid and relentless descent, resulting in a devastating memecoin crash . The speed and severity of the decline have raised eyebrows and sparked discussions about the nature of memecoin investments and the potential risks involved. Here’s a breakdown of the key events: Launch Date: March 8th Token Name: WOLF of Wall St (WOLF) Alleged Creator: Hayden Davis (LIBRA co-creator) Peak Market Cap (Briefly): Nearly $43 million Subsequent Plunge: 99% Data Source: Bubblemaps While the exact reasons behind the memecoin crash are still under scrutiny, typical factors contributing to such dramatic price drops in the memecoin market include: Pump-and-Dump Schemes: Memecoins, often driven by hype and social media buzz, are susceptible to pump-and-dump schemes. Early investors create artificial demand (the “pump”), attracting later investors, before selling off their holdings and causing a price collapse (the “dump”). Lack of Fundamental Value: Unlike established cryptocurrencies with underlying technology or use cases, memecoins often lack intrinsic value. Their price is primarily driven by speculation and community sentiment. High Volatility: The memecoin market is known for extreme volatility. Prices can surge and plummet rapidly, making them incredibly risky investments. Rug Pulls: In some cases, memecoin projects can be outright scams where developers abandon the project after raising funds, leaving investors with worthless tokens. Hayden Davis and the Shadow of a Crypto Scandal The involvement of Hayden Davis, known as a LIBRA co-creator , adds another layer of intrigue to this crypto scandal . LIBRA, the token purportedly linked to Argentine President Javier Milei, has already been a subject of controversy. Adding fuel to the fire, Argentine lawyer Gregorio Dalbon had previously requested an Interpol Red Notice against Davis. While the details surrounding this request are not explicitly linked to the WOLF token incident, it certainly casts a shadow over Davis’s involvement in the crypto space. Is this crypto scandal simply another case of memecoin volatility, or are there deeper issues at play? The connection to a figure like Hayden Davis, already facing legal scrutiny, raises questions about the legitimacy and intentions behind the WOLF token project. Investors are left wondering if this was an inevitable outcome or a deliberately orchestrated scheme. WOLF Token: A Cautionary Tale in the Memecoin Frenzy The dramatic memecoin crash of the WOLF token serves as a stark reminder of the risks associated with investing in highly speculative digital assets. While the allure of quick gains in the memecoin market is strong, the potential for significant losses is equally real. Here are some key takeaways from this event: Due Diligence is Crucial: Thorough research is essential before investing in any cryptocurrency, especially memecoins. Understand the project, its team (if known), and the underlying risks. Manage Risk Wisely: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Memecoins should be considered high-risk, high-reward investments, and portfolio allocation should reflect this. Be Wary of Hype: Memecoin prices are often driven by social media hype and influencer endorsements. Don’t let FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) cloud your judgment. Understand Tokenomics: Examine the token distribution, supply, and other tokenomics aspects. Look for red flags like a large percentage of tokens held by a small number of wallets. Consider Project Legitimacy: Assess the project’s legitimacy. Are the developers transparent? Is there a clear roadmap or purpose beyond hype? In the case of WOLF, the alleged creator’s background and prior controversies should have raised immediate concerns. The WOLF token collapse is not an isolated incident. The history of memecoins is littered with similar stories of rapid ascents followed by catastrophic falls. While some memecoins have provided early investors with substantial returns, many more have left investors holding worthless tokens. Navigating the Volatile Crypto Market The crypto market volatility is a double-edged sword. It presents opportunities for significant gains but also carries substantial risks. For those venturing into the world of memecoins, it’s crucial to approach with extreme caution and a clear understanding of the potential downsides. The WOLF token saga highlights the importance of informed decision-making and risk management in the fast-paced and often unpredictable cryptocurrency landscape. Here are some actionable insights for navigating crypto market volatility , particularly in the memecoin space: Actionable Insight Description Diversify Your Portfolio Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, especially not a memecoin basket. Spread your investments across different asset classes and cryptocurrency types. Set Realistic Expectations Understand that memecoin investments are highly speculative. Don’t expect to get rich quick, and be prepared for potential losses. Use Stop-Loss Orders Implement stop-loss orders to limit potential losses. This automatically sells your tokens if the price drops to a predetermined level. Stay Informed Keep up-to-date with crypto news and market trends. Be aware of potential scams and red flags. Consider Long-Term Investing If you’re risk-averse, focus on established cryptocurrencies with strong fundamentals and long-term growth potential rather than chasing memecoin hype. Conclusion: Lessons from the WOLF Token Debacle The WOLF token collapse serves as a dramatic and timely lesson in the perils of memecoin mania. The alleged involvement of LIBRA co-creator Hayden Davis and the swift 99% memecoin crash underscore the inherent risks in this speculative corner of the crypto market. While the dream of overnight riches may be tempting, the reality is that memecoin investments are fraught with danger. Investors must exercise extreme caution, conduct thorough due diligence, and manage risk responsibly to avoid becoming victims of the next crypto scandal or memecoin crash . The WOLF token’s fleeting moment in the spotlight is a powerful reminder: in the crypto world, what goes up fast can come down even faster.

On Mar. 16, local media outlet Yonhap reported that officials from the Bank of Korea ruled out adding Bitcoin ( BTC ) to its foreign exchange reserves in response to a written inquiry from Representative Cha Gyu-geun of the National Assembly’s Planning and Finance Committee. The central bank cited Bitcoin’s high volatility as a major concern, warning that “transaction costs to cash out Bitcoins could rise drastically” if the crypto market experiences instability. Officials also pointed out that Bitcoin does not meet the International Monetary Fund’s criteria for foreign exchange reserves, which require assets to maintain liquidity, market stability, and a credit rating of investment grade or higher. Discussions around national crypto reserves have gained traction globally, especially following the U.S. government’s decision to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . Some countries, like Brazil and the Czech Republic , have even expressed openness to the idea. Yet, the Bank of Korea maintained that a “cautious approach” is necessary, noting that institutions like the European Central Bank, the Swiss National Bank, and Japan’s financial authorities share a similarly skeptical stance. The bank further clarified that it has neither reviewed nor formally discussed the possibility of incorporating Bitcoin into its reserves.

As previously reported by crypto.news, the Financial Services Commission has also taken a similar stance. In November, FSC Chairman Kim Byung-hwan acknowledged calls for a national Bitcoin reserve but dismissed the idea as premature However, South Korea has been gradually loosening its stance on crypto regulations. The country’s financial watchdog has been working on lifting restrictions on institutional crypto trading and is preparing a second legal framework focused on stablecoin oversight. Policymakers are also considering allowing crypto exchange-traded funds, which, according to the chairman of the Korea Exchange, could bring fresh opportunities to the country’s financial sector.

Reports suggest that President Donald Trump’s team is eyeing XRP as a key player in building a powerhouse Bitcoin (BTC) reserve. A new proposal submitted to the US SEC suggests that XRP could play a key role in boosting the US financial system. The plan claims that integrating XRP could unlock $1.5 trillion in liquidity, which could then be used to buy Bitcoin. However, this idea faces major regulatory hurdles, and it remains unclear if the government will take it seriously. How XRP Could Free Up Trapped Funds The five page proposal written by Maximilian Staudinger suggests that the US should consider using XRP to free up capital stuck in Nostro accounts. These accounts, used for cross-border transactions, hold about $27 trillion globally, with around $5 trillion belonging to US banks. By using XRP, Staudinger believes that $1.5 trillion could be released and redirected toward Bitcoin purchases. Staudinger also proposes a structured crypto reserve system for the US. He argues that Bitcoin should be at the center, while Solana and Cardano could be used for government applications. However, he insists that XRP is the most important asset for handling financial transactions. Bold Bitcoin Claims Raise Questions One of the more questionable parts of the proposal is the claim that the US could buy 25 million Bitcoin at $60,000 per coin. This is impossible since Bitcoin’s total supply is only 21 million. Still, the proposal argues that using XRP could save the US up to $7.5 billion in transaction fees annually and make government payments, like Social Security and tax refunds, faster and cheaper. Regulatory Challenges Stand in the Way Despite its ambitious plan, the proposal faces a big setback—XRP’s unclear regulatory status. Staudinger urges the SEC to classify XRP as a payment asset instead of a security. He also calls on the Department of Justice to lift restrictions preventing banks from using XRP. To speed things up, he suggests a presidential executive order to bypass regulatory delays. His plan includes two timelines: a standard 24-month rollout with standard regulatory approval, government payments, and bank adoption, or opting for a fast-track 6-12 month timeline using executive orders and Fed mandates for quick XRP integration. While ambitious, the fast-track approach could work given Ripple’s existing global liquidity network. Will This Proposal Go Anywhere? While the idea sounds interesting, independent proposals like this usually don’t gain much traction unless backed by major financial institutions or government officials. Without strong support, this remains a bold idea rather than a plan the US is likely to adopt anytime soon.",News|Crypto Scam,EN,0,0,XRP|BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|FIAT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-17 05:55:31

It feels like just yesterday we were introduced to a promising new layer-1 blockchain, and now, Solana is blowing out five candles! That’s right, Solana is celebrating its fifth anniversary, and the numbers are nothing short of staggering. If you’ve been following the crypto space, you know Solana has been making waves, but the scale of its achievements might still surprise you. Let’s dive into what makes this milestone so remarkable and what it means for the future of this dynamic blockchain. Solana’s Remarkable 5-Year Journey: A Blockchain Revolution Five years in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency is an eternity, and Solana has certainly made the most of it. From its mainnet beta launch in March 2020, Solana has rapidly evolved into a powerhouse in the blockchain landscape. In a recent post on X, Solana highlighted some mind-blowing statistics that underscore its growth and impact: Over 408 Billion Transactions: Yes, you read that right – billion with a ‘B’! This colossal number speaks volumes about the sheer volume of activity happening on the Solana network. It’s a testament to Solana’s high throughput and scalability. More Than 1,300 Validators: A robust and decentralized network needs strong validators, and Solana boasts a community of over 1,300 of them. This decentralized validator set is crucial for network security and resilience. Over $987 Billion in DEX Trading Volume: Approaching the trillion-dollar mark, the decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume on Solana is astronomical. This highlights Solana’s significant role in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. These aren’t just numbers; they represent real-world usage, adoption, and the vibrant ecosystem that has flourished around Solana. And as Solana itself declared, “just getting started,” hinting at even greater things to come. Decoding Solana’s Explosive Transaction Growth: What’s the Secret Sauce? 408 billion transactions – it’s a number that begs the question: how did Solana achieve such phenomenal transaction growth? The answer lies in Solana’s innovative approach to blockchain technology. Unlike some of the earlier blockchains, Solana was designed from the ground up for speed and scalability. Here are some key factors contributing to its impressive transaction processing capabilities: Proof of History (PoH): This is Solana’s groundbreaking innovation. PoH provides a historical record that proves an event occurred at a specific moment in time. It works alongside Proof of Stake (PoS) to drastically increase transaction throughput without compromising security. Think of it as a cryptographic clock that orders transactions, making consensus much faster. High Throughput Architecture: Solana’s architecture is engineered for high performance. It leverages features like Turbine, Gulf Stream, Sea Level, Pipelining, Cloudbreak, and Archivers, all working in concert to optimize transaction processing and network efficiency. Low Transaction Fees: Speed is great, but affordability is equally crucial. Solana is renowned for its incredibly low transaction fees, often a fraction of a cent. This makes it incredibly attractive for users and applications that require frequent transactions, from DeFi trading to micro-payments. To put it into perspective, let’s compare Solana to some other prominent blockchains: Blockchain Transactions Per Second (TPS) (Approximate) Average Transaction Fee (Approximate) Solana Thousands Extremely Low ( Ethereum 15-30 Variable, Can be High ($1 – $10+) Bitcoin 7 Variable, Can be Moderate to High ($1 – $5+) *Note: TPS and fees are approximate and can fluctuate based on network conditions. As you can see, Solana stands out with its high TPS and remarkably low fees, making it a compelling choice for a wide range of applications. The Power of Solana’s Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Trading Volume: A DeFi Hotspot Nearly a trillion dollars in DEX trading volume – that’s a massive figure! It firmly establishes Solana as a major player in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) arena. But what does this DEX volume really signify? It indicates a vibrant and active DeFi ecosystem built on Solana. Here’s why this is significant: Thriving DeFi Applications: High DEX volume is a direct result of numerous successful and popular DeFi applications (DApps) being built on Solana. These include decentralized exchanges like Raydium, Orca, and Serum, lending platforms, yield aggregators, and more. Liquidity and Capital Efficiency: Large DEX volume indicates deep liquidity within the Solana DeFi ecosystem. This is crucial for traders and investors as it allows for efficient and seamless trading of digital assets. Growing User Adoption: Significant DEX activity reflects increasing user adoption of Solana for DeFi activities. People are actively using Solana to swap tokens, participate in yield farming, and engage in various DeFi strategies. Innovation in DeFi: Solana’s technical capabilities enable the development of more sophisticated and innovative DeFi products and services that might be challenging to implement on slower or more expensive blockchains. Solana’s low fees and high speed are particularly beneficial for DeFi, where users often perform multiple transactions. Whether it’s frequent trading, yield optimization strategies, or participating in new DeFi protocols, Solana provides a cost-effective and efficient environment. Solana’s Thriving Ecosystem: Validators and Community at its Heart Beyond the impressive transaction numbers and DEX volume, the strength of any blockchain lies in its community and infrastructure. Solana’s ecosystem is powered by over 1,300 validators, playing a critical role in maintaining the network’s integrity and security. Why are validators so important? Network Security: Validators participate in the consensus mechanism, verifying transactions and adding new blocks to the blockchain. Their collective effort ensures the network remains secure and resistant to attacks. Decentralization: A large and geographically diverse validator set enhances the decentralization of the Solana network. This reduces the risk of censorship and single points of failure. Network Uptime and Reliability: Validators contribute to the continuous operation of the Solana network, ensuring high uptime and reliability for users and applications. Community Governance: Validators often participate in network governance decisions, contributing to the evolution and improvement of the Solana protocol. Furthermore, Solana boasts a vibrant and growing developer and user community. This community is constantly building new applications, contributing to open-source projects, and driving innovation within the Solana ecosystem. The active community is a vital ingredient in Solana’s continued success. Looking Ahead: Solana’s Anniversary and the Future of Blockchain Innovation As Solana celebrates its fifth anniversary, it’s not just about looking back at past achievements but also looking forward to the future. The “just getting started” message is a powerful indicator of Solana’s ambitions. What can we expect from Solana in the coming years? Continued Network Upgrades: Solana is known for its rapid development and continuous network improvements. We can anticipate further optimizations to enhance scalability, security, and functionality. Expansion of the Ecosystem: Expect to see even more diverse and innovative applications being built on Solana, spanning DeFi, NFTs, gaming, and potentially new sectors we haven’t even imagined yet. Mainstream Adoption: Solana’s speed and low fees position it well for mainstream adoption. As blockchain technology becomes more integrated into everyday life, Solana is poised to play a significant role. Addressing Challenges: Like any technology, Solana faces challenges, including network congestion during peak times and the ongoing need to balance decentralization with performance. The Solana team and community are actively working on solutions to these challenges. Solana’s journey over the past five years has been nothing short of explosive. It has demonstrated the potential of high-performance blockchains and has become a key infrastructure layer for the burgeoning decentralized web. With its impressive transaction volume, thriving DeFi ecosystem, and dedicated community, Solana is not just celebrating an anniversary; it’s showcasing a revolution in blockchain technology. Happy 5th Anniversary, Solana! The future of blockchain looks brighter with you in it.

Lara Lea Trump dedicated an entire episode to the future of digital assets, featuring none other than Strategy’s chairman Michael Saylor, President Donald Trump, White House Crypto Czar David Sacks, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Saylor took center stage, sharing how he stumbled upon Bitcoin and how it changed his company’s fate. He later posted , “On Sunday night, Fox News’ hit show My View with Lara Lea Trump was devoted to Bitcoin and digital assets, using the words of Donald Trump, Crypto Czar David Sacks, Treasury Sec Scott Bessent, and yours truly to educate its mainstream audience on the power and promise of this new technology.” Trump’s Bitcoin vision and economic policies take focus The episode opened with Lara addressing the economic wreckage of the past four years—inflation, rising debt, and federal spending. She blamed the Biden-Harris administration for increasing spending by $300 billion in its final months. The national debt now stands at $36 trillion, with high interest rates squeezing businesses and taxpayers alike. Then, Donald Trump’s voice took over. He declared, “We are going to take in hundreds of billions of dollars… become so rich you won’t know where to spend that money.” He promised a Bitcoin-friendly future, calling it “America’s next big industry”. The show highlighted 10,000 manufacturing jobs added in February, and $115 billion cut in wasteful spending. Trump claimed this was just the beginning. “Last year, I promised to make America the Bitcoin superpower of the world,” he said, doubling down on plans to integrate Bitcoin into the national economy. Viewers had questions. A caller from India, Stefan, asked, “What are your hopes for crypto under a second Trump administration?” Lara responded, “My hopes are likely the same as yours—for American prosperity to thrive once again.” She reinforced Trump’s vision, saying America must lead in Bitcoin innovation. Michael Saylor gave the audience a Bitcoin reality check, as he explained in the snippet why it’s the strongest financial asset on the planet and why governments need to take it seriously. “We realized the dollar was inflating, and cash was losing value. Bitcoin is the only asset that holds purchasing power long-term,” said Saylor. A segment of the My View episode featured everyday people reacting to Bitcoin. Many admitted they didn’t understand it, some called it “sketchy”, while others said they were long-term holders waiting for big gains. Lara sent a team to New York City to ask regular people what they thought about crypto. Some were skeptical. Others were already deep in the game. One man summed it up: “I don’t understand Bitcoin, but I know one thing—banks aren’t my friend. If Bitcoin gives me freedom, I’ll take it.” Another said, “I bought crypto years ago, and I’m holding. In ten or twenty years, we’ll see where it goes.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

Last week, markets were rattled by US President Trump’s abrupt tariff announcements, but there was a little reprieve after encouraging inflation data with the CPI report coming in below expectations. However, the Consumer Sentiment Index continued its three-month slide, falling to its lowest level since November 2022 as recession fears mount. “Wednesday marks the second Fed interest rate decision of 2025, at a pivotal point in time,” commented the Kobeissi Letter. Economic Events March 17 to 21 February’s Retail Sales report will be released on Monday, offering insights into the amount of money consumers are spending on both durable and non-durable goods. This data is a leading indicator of the economy’s overall health and inflationary factors on the demand side. There are reports for industrial production showing the volume of production of US industries like manufacturing, mining, utilities, and housing starting figures on Tuesday; however, these have a low impact. All eyes will be on the US central bank on Wednesday as policymakers are widely expected to keep interest rates flat at the policy meeting. Fed officials are reluctant to make any monetary policy moves while they wait to see the effect of Trump’s economic policies. According to the CME Fed Watch tool , there is a 99% chance that rates will remain unchanged at 4.25% to $4.5%. Key Events This Week: 1. February Retail Sales data – Monday 2. February Housing Starts data – Tuesday 3. Fed Interest Rate Decision/Statement – Wednesday 4. Initial Jobless Claims data – Thursday 5. Philly Fed Manufacturing data – Thursday 6. February Existing Home Sales… — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) March 16, 2025 RBC Global Asset Management’s Andrzej Skiba said that more tariffs are likely to follow suit, adding, “This will be inflationary, and the Fed won’t likely be able to cut rates in this environment.” CryptoPotato reported that Trump’s “short-term pain” plan is a likely attempt at weakening markets with a longer-term goal of reducing inflation and interest rates. Crypto Market Outlook Crypto market capitalization has shrunk by a further 3.3% on the day in a fall to $2.8 trillion at the time of writing, with declines accelerating during Monday morning trading in Asia. Bitcoin dipped to $82,000 before recovering slightly to reclaim $83,000 at the time of writing. The asset remains down almost 11% over the past fortnight. Ethereum remains in bear market territory, having fallen below $1,900 again and with very few signs of recovery. The altcoins were predominantly in the red, with larger losses for Solana (SOL) and Pi Network (PI), while Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Polkadot (DOT) were showing minor gains.

The Department of Justice charged Ver with mail fraud , tax evasion and filing false tax returns in April 2024, alleging he hid the amount of Bitcoin ( BTC ) he owned when he renounced his US citizenship in 2014 and defrauded the Internal Revenue Service out of $48 million by failing to report the gains he made through selling them. Sharing more re the call to dismiss the prosecution against Roger Ver @PamBondi @elonmusk @realDonaldTrump @Davewarrington https://t.co/BckQwEXBW6 — marla maples (@itsmarlamaples) March 16, 2025 Maples and Trump met in the mid-1980s during his first marriage to Ivana Trump, and was his second wife from 1993 until 1999. She has long been involved with philanthropy and has advocated for multiple charities and causes. She is seemingly still close to and supportive of Trump, who together have a daughter, Tiffany Trump. Maples attended Trump’s inauguration and told the London Evening Standard in July that she was “open to whatever way that I can serve” the then-presidential bidder. Maples joins a host of high-profile figures calling to stop the prosecution of Ver, which includes Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and online black market Silk Road creator Ross Ulbricht, who was facing a double life sentence in prison until Trump pardoned him in January. Ver has appealed to Trump for a pardon, claiming he is being unfairly persecuted and is a victim of “lawfare.” Neither Trump nor the White House has publicly acknowledged Ver’s plea, but Trump’s cost-cutting czar Musk said in a January X post that Ver “gave up his US citizenship. No pardon for Ver. Membership has its privileges.” Related: Roger Ver’s Trump pardon plea: ‘Lawfare’ victim or tax evader? Ver was arrested in Spain at the time of the US indictment pending his extradition to the US but was later granted bail on the condition he remain in the country. He moved to dismiss the government’s case in December, arguing the charges were unconstitutional, and the IRS’ “exit tax” for renounced citizens is “inscrutably vague” when applied to crypto.

Here's Why,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/south-koreas-central-bank-rules-out-the-possibility-of-holding-bitcoin-in-foreign-exchange-reserves-heres-why/,"South Korea's central bank has rejected the possibility of holding Bitcoin in its foreign exchange reserves, citing concerns about the cryptocurrency's high volatility and non-compliance with international financial rules. South Korea's Central Bank Rejects Bitcoin Reserves, Citing Volatility In response to a written question from a member of the National Assembly Strategy and Finance Committee, the Central Bank announced that it does not consider Bitcoin as a reserve asset. The central bank stressed that the significant transaction costs associated with converting Bitcoin into cash could pose a risk to financial stability. Additionally, the South Korean central bank referred to the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) guidelines on foreign exchange reserve management, which emphasize prudent control of liquidity, market and credit risks. Discussions regarding national Bitcoin reserves gained momentum after US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on March 6 to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve using BTC seized from criminal and civil cases. While Trump’s move has led many countries to explore the idea of holding Bitcoin reserves, South Korea remains skeptical. The central bank’s position aligns with Japan, Switzerland and the European Central Bank, which have all been wary of accepting Bitcoin as part of their foreign exchange reserves. Despite rejecting Bitcoin as a reserve asset, South Korea is taking steps to ease strict crypto regulations. The country’s financial authorities are gradually lifting restrictions on institutional crypto trading and are currently preparing a second legal framework focused on stablecoin regulation. As South Korea balances crypto market growth with regulatory oversight, debate over Bitcoin’s role in national reserves is likely to continue. *This is not investment advice.

In a stunning turn of events, North Korea has reportedly ascended to the ranks of a major Bitcoin holder, securing the third-largest government position globally. Yes, you read that right. While nations worldwide grapple with crypto regulation and adoption, it appears North Korea has been quietly amassing a significant digital fortune. Let’s dive into the details of this surprising development and explore what it means for the future of cryptocurrency and global geopolitics. Shocking North Korea Bitcoin Holdings Revealed According to a recent report by Bitcoin.com, leveraging data from the esteemed Arkham Intelligence, North Korea now holds the third-largest stash of Bitcoin among governments worldwide. This revelation is based on the identified holdings of the Lazarus Group, a notorious hacking collective with ties to North Korea. Arkham Intelligence’s meticulous on-chain analysis pinpoints the Lazarus Group as possessing a staggering 13,562 BTC. This places North Korea ahead of nations like Bhutan and El Salvador in the government Bitcoin holdings race, painting a fascinating, if not slightly concerning, picture of global crypto distribution. But how does this compare to other nations? Let’s take a look at the top players in the government Bitcoin holding arena: Rank Government Bitcoin Holdings (BTC) 1 United States 198,109 2 United Kingdom 61,245 3 North Korea 13,562 4 Bhutan 10,635 5 El Salvador 6,117 As you can see, the United States and the United Kingdom dwarf other nations in their Bitcoin reserves. However, North Korea’s position at number three is undeniably noteworthy, especially considering the nation’s isolated economic and political standing on the global stage. This data underscores the diverse and sometimes unexpected ways in which Bitcoin is being adopted and utilized by different entities around the world. Decoding Government Bitcoin Holdings: Why North Korea? The question that naturally arises is: why is North Korea accumulating Bitcoin, and how did they amass such a significant amount? The answer, according to the report, lies with the Lazarus Group. This hacking collective, infamous for its cybercriminal activities, is believed to be responsible for numerous high-profile crypto heists, including the recent breach of the crypto exchange Bybit. It’s suspected that the Bitcoin held by North Korea is largely derived from these illicit activities. This raises several critical points about the nature of government Bitcoin holdings and the methods of acquisition: Sanctions Evasion: North Korea faces stringent international sanctions due to its nuclear weapons program. Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, offer a potential avenue to bypass these sanctions and access the global financial system. Funding State Operations: The funds obtained through cybercrime and cryptocurrency holdings could be used to finance various state operations, including military programs and government initiatives. Decentralized Finance Advantage: Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and relative anonymity make it an attractive tool for nations seeking to operate outside the traditional financial framework. Economic Strategy: In a nation with limited access to international trade and finance, Bitcoin could be viewed as a strategic asset and a store of value, albeit a volatile one. Lazarus Group Crypto Activities and Bybit Breach The Lazarus Group’s role in North Korea’s Bitcoin adoption strategy cannot be overstated. This sophisticated hacking organization has been linked to numerous cyberattacks targeting financial institutions and cryptocurrency exchanges globally. Their modus operandi often involves sophisticated phishing campaigns, malware deployment, and exploiting vulnerabilities in exchange security systems. The recent breach of Bybit, a prominent crypto exchange, further highlights Lazarus Group’s ongoing and impactful operations within the crypto sphere. The implications of Lazarus Group’s activities are far-reaching: Increased Scrutiny on Crypto Exchanges: Incidents like the Bybit breach underscore the need for robust security measures and enhanced vigilance within the cryptocurrency exchange ecosystem. Geopolitical Cybersecurity Concerns: State-sponsored cybercrime, particularly for financial gain, raises significant geopolitical cybersecurity concerns and necessitates international cooperation to combat these threats. Reputational Risks for Crypto: The association of cryptocurrency with illicit activities, such as those attributed to Lazarus Group, can negatively impact the overall perception and mainstream adoption of crypto assets. The Broader Picture: Bitcoin Adoption and Crypto Regulation North Korea’s emergence as a significant Bitcoin holder is just one facet of the evolving global crypto landscape. Across the world, governments are grappling with how to regulate, manage, and potentially leverage cryptocurrencies. While some nations, like El Salvador, have embraced Bitcoin as legal tender, others remain cautious, citing concerns about volatility, money laundering, and illicit financing. The situation with North Korea adds another layer of complexity to the ongoing discussions around crypto regulation : Regulatory Challenges: How can international regulatory bodies effectively address the use of cryptocurrency by sanctioned nations and cybercriminal organizations? Transparency and Traceability: Enhancing the transparency and traceability of cryptocurrency transactions is crucial to deter illicit activities, but also raises privacy concerns. International Cooperation: Combating crypto-related crime and illicit financing requires robust international cooperation and information sharing between governments and law enforcement agencies. Innovation vs. Security: Striking a balance between fostering innovation in the crypto space and ensuring security and regulatory compliance remains a key challenge for policymakers worldwide. Navigating the Future of Crypto and Global Finance The revelation of North Korea’s substantial Bitcoin holdings serves as a stark reminder of the multifaceted nature of cryptocurrency and its growing influence on the global stage. It highlights both the potential benefits and inherent risks associated with decentralized digital currencies. As governments and institutions continue to navigate the complexities of crypto regulation and adoption, the case of North Korea underscores the urgent need for international dialogue, enhanced cybersecurity measures, and a balanced approach that fosters innovation while mitigating risks. The crypto world is constantly evolving, and stories like this one demonstrate just how dynamic and unpredictable it can be.

Bloomberg reported on March 11 that the EU regulators were investigating OKX’s Web3 services for allegedly laundering funds from the Bybit hack, prompting OKX President Hong Fang and other executives to call Bloomberg's report misleading and assert the company's commitment to combating financial crime. ""We are addressing a tagging issue with explorers that highlights OKX DEX aggregator as the destination of trades when in fact, OKX DEX aggregator just looks for the best price to execute the order, and then the final order/trade is placed on one of the DEXs our aggregator connects to,"" a spokesperson for OKX told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. The spokesperson said that after consulting regulators, they proactively paused our DEX aggregator to implement new tagging and security upgrades.

Crypto exchange OKX has taken swift action, announcing the temporary suspension of its decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator service. This decisive move comes in response to the detection of a cyberattack attempt attributed to the infamous North Korean Lazarus Group. Let’s delve into the details of this developing situation and understand what it means for crypto users and the broader industry. Why Did OKX Suspend its DEX Aggregator? The primary reason behind OKX ‘s suspension of its DEX aggregator service is the detection of a security threat. The exchange identified an attack attempt originating from the Lazarus Group, a notorious cybercriminal organization with a history of targeting financial institutions and cryptocurrency platforms. Recognizing the potential risks, OKX proactively chose to halt the service to safeguard user assets and platform integrity. This immediate response highlights the critical importance of robust security measures in the crypto space. Here’s a breakdown of the key factors leading to this decision: Detection of Lazarus Group Attack: OKX’s security systems flagged suspicious activity linked to the Lazarus Group, prompting immediate investigation. Proactive Security Measure: To prevent potential exploitation and protect user funds, OKX opted for a temporary suspension of the DEX aggregator. System Updates: The suspension allows OKX to implement significant updates to its security infrastructure, enhancing its defenses against sophisticated threats. Collaboration for Enhanced Security: OKX is actively working with blockchain explorers to improve address labeling and threat intelligence. What is a DEX Aggregator and Why is it Important? For those new to the crypto world, understanding what a DEX aggregator does is crucial. A DEX aggregator is a platform that combines liquidity from multiple decentralized exchanges (DEXs) into one interface. This offers users several advantages: Better Prices: By sourcing liquidity from various DEXs, aggregators can find the best possible prices for trades, reducing slippage and maximizing returns. Convenience: Users can access multiple DEXs through a single platform, simplifying the trading process and eliminating the need to navigate different interfaces. Increased Liquidity: Aggregators pool liquidity, making it easier to execute larger trades and access a wider range of tokens. However, DEX aggregators, like any platform in the crypto space, are not immune to security risks. The interconnected nature of these services means that vulnerabilities in one area can potentially be exploited. This incident with OKX underscores the ongoing need for vigilance and continuous improvement in crypto exchange security protocols. Lazarus Group: Understanding the Cyber Threat The Lazarus Group is not just another run-of-the-mill hacking group. Attributed to North Korea, this organization is known for its sophisticated and persistent cyberattacks, often aimed at generating revenue for the regime. They have been linked to numerous high-profile cybercrimes, including: Bank Heists: Lazarus Group is notorious for targeting banks and financial institutions globally, attempting to steal funds through cyber intrusions. Cryptocurrency Theft: They have become increasingly active in targeting cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets, siphoning off digital assets. Ransomware Attacks: While less frequent, Lazarus has also been associated with ransomware campaigns, further highlighting their diverse cybercriminal activities. Their tactics are constantly evolving, making them a persistent and dangerous threat in the cybersecurity landscape. The fact that OKX detected and responded to an attempted attack from this group speaks to the seriousness of the situation and the importance of proactive security measures in the security of digital assets. OKX’s Enhanced Security Measures: What’s New? In response to the Lazarus Group incident and as part of its ongoing commitment to user safety, OKX is implementing several enhanced security features. These measures are designed to create a more robust and secure trading environment. Let’s explore some of the key updates: Illegal IP Blocking: OKX is now actively blocking access from IP addresses associated with illicit activities and high-risk regions, adding an extra layer of defense against unauthorized access. Real-time Black Address Detection: The exchange has implemented systems for real-time detection of blacklisted addresses, helping to prevent transactions with known malicious entities. Blockchain Explorer Collaboration: Working with blockchain explorers to optimize incomplete labeling is crucial for identifying and tracking suspicious transactions more effectively. This collaboration enhances transparency and aids in investigations. Security System Updates: Beyond these specific features, OKX is undertaking significant updates to its overall security system, strengthening its infrastructure against evolving cyber threats. These proactive steps demonstrate OKX’s dedication to maintaining a secure platform and protecting its users from sophisticated cyberattacks. The focus on preventative measures and collaboration within the crypto community is a positive sign for the industry as a whole. What Does This Mean for Crypto Users? The temporary suspension of OKX’s DEX aggregator service and the detection of the Lazarus Group attack serve as a stark reminder of the ongoing security challenges in the cryptocurrency space. For crypto users, this situation underscores several important points: Security is Paramount: Always prioritize security when choosing a crypto exchange or platform. Look for exchanges with a strong track record of security measures and proactive responses to threats. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with security news and announcements from exchanges and the broader crypto industry. Awareness is a crucial first step in protecting your assets. Diversification of Risk: Consider diversifying your holdings across multiple exchanges and wallets to mitigate the impact of a potential security breach on any single platform. Utilize Security Features: Take advantage of security features offered by exchanges, such as two-factor authentication (2FA), address whitelisting, and security alerts. While the news of a cyberattack attempt can be concerning, OKX’s swift and transparent response is a positive example of how exchanges are evolving to meet these challenges. The ongoing battle against cyber threats in the crypto world requires constant vigilance and innovation. Looking Ahead: The Future of Crypto Exchange Security The incident with OKX and the Lazarus Group highlights the continuous need for advancement in crypto exchange security. As the crypto industry matures and becomes more mainstream, attracting both legitimate users and malicious actors, security will remain a top priority. We can expect to see further developments in areas such as: Advanced Threat Intelligence: Exchanges will increasingly rely on sophisticated threat intelligence to proactively identify and mitigate potential attacks. AI and Machine Learning: Artificial intelligence and machine learning will play a growing role in detecting and responding to cyber threats in real-time. Decentralized Security Solutions: Innovations in decentralized security technologies may offer new approaches to safeguarding crypto assets and platforms. Industry Collaboration: Increased collaboration and information sharing among exchanges, blockchain explorers, and cybersecurity firms will be essential to combatting sophisticated threats like the Lazarus Group. OKX’s response to this incident, including the suspension of its DEX aggregator and the implementation of enhanced security measures, sets a positive precedent for the industry. It demonstrates a commitment to user safety and a proactive approach to addressing evolving cyber threats. As the crypto landscape continues to grow, such vigilance and responsiveness will be crucial for building trust and ensuring the long-term sustainability of the industry. Conclusion: Secure Crypto is a Shared Responsibility The temporary suspension of OKX’s DEX aggregator service due to the Lazarus Group attack attempt is a stark reminder of the ever-present security challenges in the cryptocurrency world. However, it also showcases the proactive measures that exchanges like OKX are taking to protect their users. By enhancing security systems, collaborating with blockchain explorers, and implementing features like illegal IP blocking and real-time black address detection, OKX is reinforcing its commitment to a secure trading environment. For crypto users, this incident serves as a crucial lesson in prioritizing security, staying informed, and taking proactive steps to safeguard their digital assets. The pursuit of secure crypto is a shared responsibility, requiring vigilance and collaboration across the entire ecosystem.

Key stakeholders have been selling, and the custody of even more Bitcoin seems to have been passed from just a few hands to many. Substantial outflows from the wallets of significant holders—those with even just 100 BTC to 1,000 BTC stashed inside—have shown, in private chats seen by Decrypt, that these trusted holders—who have long seemed to backstop the price of Bitcoin—have not been in the mood of late to, you know, backstop the price of Bitcoin. Mid-Sized Holders Lead the Way in Bitcoin Dumping The data spotlight a striking phenomenon in Bitcoin’s marketplace over the last week. Wallets that hold between 100 and 1,000 BTC have been sending a substantial amount of the cryptocurrency into the marketplace, with 50,625 BTC having been sold over the last week. Those sales were worth about $4.07 billion. Meanwhile, the wallets that hold between 10 and 100 BTC have also been feeling the urge to sell, with those wallets sending another 7,062 BTC into the marketplace, worth about $567.1 million. So, mid-sized Bitcoin holders are definitely driving the current selling pressure. Bitcoin's key stakeholders are showing signs of dumping: Wallets with 100-1,000 $BTC : -50,625 Bitcoin (-$4.07B) in the past week Wallets with 10-100 $BTC : -7,062 Bitcoin (-$567.1M) in the past week Over the long-term, markets tend to fluctuate with a mid-sized… pic.twitter.com/jSioi9mzuS — Santiment (@santimentfeed) March 13, 2025 A market that remains sensitive to supply and demand fluctuations can feel the impact of the actions of these wallet tiers on Bitcoin’s price. In the long run, we have seen a nearly direct relationship between the price of Bitcoin and the market’s behavior when it comes to these mid-sized holders. If they decide to for whatever reason sell off their assets, it can— and mostly tends to— trigger wider market movements and lead to a price drop. Short-Term Holders Contributing to Market Weakness The concerns are compounded by what short-term Bitcoin holders are doing. These are people who have held the asset for one to three months. Since February, the short-term holders have taken $100 billion in losses. Adding insult to injury, these holders are selling—often at a loss—and this is putting more downward pressure on the already fragile Bitcoin price. It is clear that a significant number of these holders have decided to exit their positions. Market sentiment has shifted from a bullish outlook to one that is cautious and perhaps even fearful. Short-term $BTC holders (1-3 months) have dumped $100B in realized losses since February—selling at a loss and adding pressure to the market. Prices could dip further, but their exit might be clearing out weak hands. If long-term holders step in, this could be a pivotal shift… pic.twitter.com/ntGy18W7g4 — Kyledoops (@kyledoops) March 14, 2025 Currently, a significant factor contributing to the downturn of the Bitcoin market is the selling of the cryptocurrency by short-term holders at a loss. Often referred to in the cryptocurrency community as ‘weak hands,’ these individuals may be selling out of fear or uncertainty about Bitcoin’s forthcoming price movements. Still, they might also be selling for more positive reasons; namely, their selling could be part of an overall cleansing of the speculative market for Bitcoin. Potential for Further Price Declines Even more, by mid-sized and short-term holders exerting pressure on Bitcoin, we could see its price drop in the next few days or weeks. The market may react to the offloading of these larger stakeholders by seeing even more selling pressure. In this scenario, further Bitcoin depreciation seems likely. Nevertheless, the departure of the weaker hands is not in and of itself a bad thing for Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. After the market has stabilized post-sell-off, there may be a chance for not just a recovery but for a scenario seen all too often in Bitcoin’s storied past: a price floor followed by an upward spike. This is not something that strange companies like Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan should be cheering for, or that we should be cheering for, either. Enabling Bitcoin to be a better store of value and a better medium of exchange should be the end game. A Shift in Sentiment: Could Long-Term Holders Save the Market? The crucial question now is whether Bitcoin’s dip will be bought up by long-term holders who will step in to stabilize the market. Long-term holders—that is, folks who have had Bitcoin for over a year—are generally less impacted by the kind of price fluctuations that we see in the market lately. If these holders start to accumulate more Bitcoin during this dip, it could mark a crucial change in the sentiment surrounding Bitcoin. Considering Bitcoin’s history of price movement cycles, one can discern that the long-term holders of the digital asset have, on many occasions, been the prime movers in recovering the Bitcoin price after it (not too infrequently) plummets. With the current Bitcoin price at $20,000—this after it was at an all-time high of about $900 in December 2017—one can muse on the price recovery potential of the asset in light of its history. Conclusion: Bitcoin Faces Uncertainty, But a Rebound Is Possible To sum up, the Bitcoin market is under substantial pressure, with key stakeholders like mid-sized and short-term holders appearing to dump their assets. The combined selling activity has led to some sizable losses and has pushed Bitcoin’s price down even further. On the other hand, seeing weaker hands exit might clear the way for a Bitcoin market rebound—if, of course, long-term holders now step in to provide support. Currently, the market is uncertain; however, this period of volatility may provide an opportunity for long-term investors who believe in Bitcoin to invest. If these investors start accumulating Bitcoin at lower prices, it may help signal the start of a new upward trend and provide much-needed stability to the market. As ever, market watchers will need to keep a close eye on things, as a crucial next few weeks could very well decide Bitcoin’s price path for the balance of the year. The question is: will the HODLers step in and restore market confidence, or will the market be driven deeper into correction by further selling pressures?

41796286,https://nulltx.com/?p=147112,1742196241,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Ethereum’s Sentiment Decline: A Potential for an Unexpected Breakout Amid Market Caution,https://nulltx.com/ethereums-sentiment-decline-a-potential-for-an-unexpected-breakout-amid-market-caution/,"Ethereum , the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has been witnessing a steady decline in sentiment within the crypto community over recent months. The price of Ethereum (ETH), as per the latest data, stands at $1,865, a level not seen in over a year’s time. This drop in valuation, tied up with the rise in uncertainty and fear, has kept talks alive about the potential for an unexpected breakout. Negative sentiment and market FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) have gotten people talking about the next cryptocurrency likely to fail. Yet, could Ethereum be the one caught in the crosshairs next? This article considers some reasons for a potential rally in the price of ETH. The crypto community's sentiment toward Ethereum continues to drop more and more over time. The #2 market cap's value sits at $1,865 at the time of this writing, and the more FUD that continues to show, the better the argument gets for an eventual unexpected $ETH breakout. pic.twitter.com/FZmTddEDFy — Santiment (@santimentfeed) March 13, 2025 The Downtrend and Current Market Sentiment The price of Ethereum has retreated sharply, reaching depths not seen in more than a year. This drop has surfaced some pretty unsavory speculation about our favorite smart contract platform, with a number of investors and market analysts now arguing that it could be on the cusp of even steeper losses. In a recent conversation, my buddy Sander van de Haar—the head of ZENIQ and a former senior portfolio manager at exactus—reflected on this situation and some of the other factors and data points that have come into play over the last week. Yet, when negative sentiment floods the crypto space, quite the opposite effect can take place—a setup for an unexpected breakout. An overly bearish market can reverse like a runaway bull. Participants in that space may have already exhausted the worst-case scenarios when pricing BTC or ETH. Those two cryptos may be coiling up for an event-driven breakout, and that event doesn’t necessarily have to involve a change in price for either crypto. Even though the price of Ethereum is under pressure, the amount of liquidations in the market has been moderate when compared to downturns we’ve seen in the past. This indicates that although a good number of investors are playing it safe and being somewhat cautious, they are not, in fact, panicking. Instead, they seem to be preferring to remain quite still and making no moves of any sort until they receive a clear signal to do something—either to buy or to sell. A Cautious Stance Amid Global Uncertainty Recently, the overall market shift toward caution is one of the main reasons for Ethereum’s poor performance. Data from IntoTheBlock show a marked drop in high-risk loans on decentralized lending platforms. These are loan agreements between investors and DeFi users in which the lenders are assuming a lot of risk. It’s clear now that a lot of crypto investors are assuming a risk-off posture that has them pulling back from these high-stakes agreements. Why? Because with global macro concerns multiplying by the day, they just don’t feel very secure about putting their money to work in riskier assets. And these concerns are affecting more than just crypto investors and lending platforms. When major matters such as these appear, investors become risk-averse. This is when they seek safer investments instead of taking wild risks with assets like Ethereum, which is much more prone to ups and downs. With the global economy in such an uncertain state and the ongoing regulatory examination of all things crypto, the pullback from risky positions all around seems likely to continue. The caution is particularly clear in the Ethereum market, where holders of the asset express increasing concern about its future. Those holders, who typically think of Ethereum as amounting to a kind of long-term, low-risk investment, are not only worried about further price declines but are also starting to envision the worst-case scenarios—possible disruptions to the market and even the network itself. This sentiment has led to not only a contraction in the apparent overall adoption of Ethereum but also a contraction in the number of actual users of the network. Ethereum’s Potential Target of $1,250 The ongoing market dynamics, coupled with the weakening investor sentiment, have ignited talks about the chances of Ethereum making a further descent. Should Ethereum’s price continue in this downward spiral, some analysts see the potential target as low as $1,250—a level to which they are pointing after Ethereum broke out of a parallel channel. #Ethereum $ETH targets $1,250 after breaking out from this parallel channel! pic.twitter.com/XS3N9p8Unr — Ali (@ali_charts) March 14, 2025 Taking this step would serve to strengthen the notion among investors that Ethereum is currently involved in a long-term bear market. Ethereum’s flows into spot ETFs have shown a trend downward over the past few months, indicating that institutional interest in the asset and in asset-based funds is trending downward too. This is all part of a broader narrative in play right now. March 13 saw a total net outflow from Ethereum spot ETFs of $73.63 million. This is significant not just because of the amount involved but also because it underscores a trend of just not having that much capital coming back to Ethereum. On March 13, the total net outflow of Bitcoin spot ETF was 143 million US dollars, the net inflow of BlackRock ETF IBIT was 45.7467 million US dollars, and the total net outflow of Ethereum spot ETF was 73.6289 million US dollars. https://t.co/59u0BnEqLG — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 14, 2025 Looking Ahead: Is a Breakout Possible? Even though Ethereum presently has a depressed sentiment, moderate liquidations, and macro uncertainties to deal with, there is a reason for optimism. The decline in high-risk loans along with relatively stable liquidations suggests that market participants are not in a state of panic. If this is the case, then it’s a sign that Ethereum could be basing for a potential reversal. In the crypto space, sentiment often plays a pivotal part in deciding price directions. The currently prevailing bearish sentiment could very well act as a catalyst for a surprise bullish breakout, especially if the Ethereum ecosystem were to have some positive developments or news. If Ethereum can work its way around the current overlay of macroeconomic troubles and regulatory concerns, it might recapture past peak prices in what could feel like a blast from the Ethereum past. At this point, though, Ethereum’s price is still in a delicate condition, with a bearish target of $1,250 hanging over it. A lot of the price action will probably come down to what the Ethereum Foundation and related developers do to either improve or kind of keep things as they are now within the Ethereum network. But market sentiment in the overall crypto space is also up for grabs and could shift in either direction contingent on any number of as-yet-unfolded macroeconomic developments. Conclusion Ethereum’s recent drop in sentiment and price mirrors the more widespread problems of the cryptocurrency market, with complex macroeconomic uncertainties taking a toll on investor interest and enthusiasm. However, the relative calm of on-chain data gathered from Ethereum seems to suggest that long-term holders are mostly content… and part of a near-constant accumulation of Ethereum. This context certainly allows for the possibility that Ethereum could break out unexpectedly in the near term, with a target price even above $1,250 still in the cards (while the kind of swift breakout that might not happen without some external catalyst is not completely ruled out either).

Citing two sources within the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the expert outlined several possible outcomes for the Ripple vs SEC case. Notably, AP Abacus’ predictions drew skeptical responses and raised eyebrows from legal experts John Deaton, Bill Morgan, and Fred Rispoli. Let’s dive into the experts’ reactions and explore their implications for Ripple’s future. XRP Lawsuit Nears Endgame: Experts React Recently, Arch Public co-founder Andrew AP Abacus took to X to share insights on the imminent resolution of the prolonged XRP lawsuit. He stated, “*two* SEC sources believe Ripple case is very close to ending.” Significantly, the potential conclusion of the Ripple vs SEC case is a long-standing debate. AP Abacus’ recent post added fuel to the fire, generating both optimism and skepticism. While many community members remain optimistic, legal experts and XRP lawyers raise eyebrows. For instance, pro-XRP attorney John Deaton’s simple reaction gained attention as he posted a pair of eyes emoji, conveying his surprise and skepticism. Similarly, Bill Morgan, another prominent XRP lawyer, expressed mixed reactions to AP Abacus’ predictions. Bill Morgan raised concerns over certain aspects of the expert’s predictions, while also acknowledging some positive points. XRP Lawsuit: Possible Outcomes In his X post, AP Abacus provided a few possible outcomes for the XRP lawsuit as it nears its conclusion. According to him, the US SEC may consider classifying the XRP token as a commodity. This possible classification could have a significant implication over the regulatory status of XRP. UPDATE: *two* SEC sources believe @Ripple case is very close to ending. Some expected outcomes: • “expect $XRP to get serious commodity consideration.” • “greatly reduced fine; GREATLY reduced” • “new leadership knows this case and how they handle it is a big deal;… — Andrew (@AP_Abacus) March 17, 2025 In addition, AP Abacus stated that the Ripple may face a reduced fine in the XRP lawsuit. While the penalty imposed by Judge Analisa Torres is $125 million, a reduced fine could invoke a new turn in the Ripple vs SEC case. Interestingly, XRP advocacy platform All Things XRP had previously predicted a penalty reduction , assigning it a 30% probability. Further, the expert suggested that the US SEC’s new leadership recognizes the significance of this case and its potential to set a precedent for future regulatory decisions. This implies that the SEC may take a more cautious approach, ultimately benefitting Ripple. Ripple Case Outcome Sparks Mixed Reactions While John Deaton expressed his confusion with an emoji, XRP lawyer Bill Morgan shares a detailed opinion on AP Abacus’ Ripple lawsuit predictions. While Morgan remains hopeful about some points, including the XRP’s classification and the SEC’s cautious approach, he acknowledges a significant obstacle – the injunction- that needs to be addressed. Meanwhile, legal expert Fred Rispoli shared a lighthearted message with a mix of humor, sarcasm, and optimism. He admits that he’s selective in believing AP Abacus’ sources. He asserted that he would rather believe the positive updates while being skeptical of the negative. Rispoli attributes his selective skepticism to his “unbridled hope” for a favorable outcome, rather than hypocrisy. In other words, his optimism makes him receptive of positive news and more doubtful of negative outcomes. Previously, Rispoli had dismissed delay discussions on the XRP lawsuit resolution, asserting that a settlement is simple and possible.

Long-term holders keep accumulating it, and whale investors have also been making moves lately. Even with the substantial market ups and downs, transaction fees for Bitcoin have dropped to levels we haven’t seen since September 2024. In addition to that, those fees have also dropped at a time when we’re seeing more and more long-term holders of Bitcoin. Why is this significant? The shift in fee levels is definitely a positive sentiment shift. Total Bitcoin fees have once again decreased this week despite the significant market shifts, reaching levels not seen since Sept '24 pic.twitter.com/ZX28A9wRmS — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) March 14, 2025 Long-Term Holders Double Down on Bitcoin One of the most remarkable trends over the last month has been the ongoing accumulation of Bitcoin by long-term holders. In the preceding 30 days, these holders have added more than 131,000 BTC to their wallets. It is an expression of the confidence we are seeing from many investors who view Bitcoin as a long-term store of value. Long-term #Bitcoin holders have been on a buying spree, adding over 131,000 $BTC to their wallets in the past month! pic.twitter.com/7CWlWXX2uh — Ali (@ali_charts) March 13, 2025 Long-term holders are often considered the foundation of the Bitcoin ecosystem. These investors hold their Bitcoin for long durations and tend to keep it nearly inalterable for as long as they hold. They are a bit like the Shakers of the Bitcoin world. The not-so-secret secret about Shaking is that you do more of it when you are actually quite peaceful. The Shaking dance consists of fast movements that are almost frenzied. Meanwhile, many, many such movements are all part of partaking peacefully in the Shaking community. Even as the conditions of the market fluctuate, this accumulation comes at a time when the price of Bitcoin remains volatile. Yet these holders are undeterred. They are confident that the digital asset will continue to thrive. Accumulating Bitcoin in any kind of market is a bold statement of confidence. These investors are making that statement. Whales Make Their Presence Felt Besides the actions of long-term holders, another group is making a huge impact in the Bitcoin market. We are talking about whales—large Bitcoin investors. In the past 48 hours, these whales have purchased over 20,000 Bitcoin. That buying has added to the overall bullish sentiment that is coalescing among big players in the Bitcoin market. Due to their large amounts, whales can usually move the market when they want to. The buying of such a large amount of Bitcoin in such a short time span suggests that this investing group is positioning itself for some serious price appreciation in the near-to-medium future. With their resources and long-term vision, whales are strong market movers. Their recent buying of Bitcoin in seriously large chunks has the smell of optimism about it. The precise causes of the whale purchases remain unclear, but it’s evident that a large number of these investors see the present market situation as a chance to add significantly to their Bitcoin holdings ahead of what they foresee as the next substantial price upswing. Bitcoin Spot ETFs: Mixed Movements Reflect Changing Investor Sentiment Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) of Bitcoin have focused attention in the marketplace. Notable outflows of $143 million from Bitcoin spot ETFs on March 13 marked a substantial departure from the week-to-week inflows of recent memory. Those inflows had signaled a strengthening tide of interest from a new class of institutional investors. In contrast to their counterparts in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, ETFs of Bitcoin allow investors to capture the day-to-day price movements of the asset without having to buy the actual asset. Conversely, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, called IBIT, experienced a net inflow of $45.7 million during the same timeframe. This sharp contrast between the net outflow from other spot ETFs and the net inflow into BlackRock’s ETF underscores a not-so-clear distinction between investor preferences and decisions. On March 13, the total net outflow of Bitcoin spot ETF was 143 million US dollars, the net inflow of BlackRock ETF IBIT was 45.7467 million US dollars, and the total net outflow of Ethereum spot ETF was 73.6289 million US dollars. https://t.co/59u0BnEqLG — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 14, 2025 The more significant inflow into IBIT suggests that BlackRock’s ETF is viewed more favorably among investors who want exposed to Bitcoin but who prefer to invest in what they deem to be more structured and regulated products. The difference in ETF flows might show that institutional investors are becoming pickier in their Bitcoin investments. Some might have lowered their exposure, but others seem to have upped the ante on funds backed by well-known, well-respected financial firms. That might reflect a somewhat positive but cautious outlook on Bitcoin’s prospects. Decreasing Bitcoin Transaction Fees Amid Market Shifts Another important trend is the reduced costs of transacting in Bitcoin. Transaction fees have fallen to their lowest levels since September 2020. This may be indicating fewer transactions taking place or some other shift in the market’s operation. When fees drop, though, one clear and unambiguous message sent is that the network isn’t congested and shouldn’t be for the foreseeable future. That’s good news for anyone looking to transact and not incur costs that eat into the amount of Bitcoin received. Less congestion means transaction times should also be consistent. Lower fees could also make Bitcoin more appealing as a way to pay or send money across national borders. Of course, a slowdown in activity could lead to lower fees, and that is one way to read the current situation (beautifully summarized by Aaron Brown at Bloomberg). But with lower fees, users in all circumstances are better off. Conclusion: A Positive Outlook Despite Short-Term Fluctuations The latest happenings in the Bitcoin market—characterized by the steady accumulation of long-term holders, the active play of whales, mixed inflows and outflows from ETFs, and falling transaction fees—show that investors are still very much hopeful for Bitcoin’s future. Sure, it could always be said that the market is simply pricing in the potential of a future fully functioning Bitcoin network. And yet, a network only fully functions if enough people use it, right? And the thing I always come back to is that using Bitcoin always and everywhere is not yet quite a thing. And so what are the price signals really telling us? As the interest from institutions keeps increasing, especially through regulated products like Bitcoin ETFs, and as Bitcoin’s value as a store of value keeps resonating, the current trends seem to indicate a favorable future for the cryptocurrency. The coalescing whale activity, long-term holder accumulation, and seemingly favorable network conditions suggest that Bitcoin might very well keep proceeding on its current upward path, with these developments somehow looking set to drive it even higher in the months to come.

""I’ve been in the investment business for 35 years, and I can tell you that corrections are healthy, they are normal,” Bessent said Sunday on NBC’s Meet The Press, according to Bloomberg . “I‘m not worried about the markets. Over the long term, if we put good tax policy in place, deregulation and energy security, the markets will do great.” Bessent's comment contradicts popular belief that the Trump administration will quickly douse any fire stemming from the administration's policy moves, particularly trade tariffs. President Donald Trump also recently clarified his stance, saying he is not looking at the stock market. Wall Street's tech-heavy index, Nasdaq, and the S&P 500 entered correction last week, falling over 10% from their February highs predominantly on concerns that Trump's tariffs could slow economic growth while leading to sticky inflation. Bitcoin (BTC), too, has taken a beating, down nearly 25% from the record highs above $109K in January, according to CoinDesk Indices data , tracking the risk-off on Wall Street and digesting disappointment over the absence of fresh BTC purchases under Trump's strategic digital assets reserve plan. The risk-off has revved up expectations of policy support from the government or the Federal Reserve (Fed), particularly in the crypto community. However, Bessent's take suggests that it may take longer to manifest or require more significant market declines before any action is taken. The Treasury secretary said last month that the Trump administration is focused on lowering the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which influences most long-term loans in the economy. Meanwhile, Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues stressed early this month that they are watching to see the “net effects” of Trump's policies on the economy and are not in a hurry to cut rates.

From Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Gaming, to the ongoing evolution of meme coins, we’ve been seeing some pretty significant wallet activity that signals a newfound confidence in these sectors. So, which projects might be driving this recent influx of confidence? And what stories are gaining traction in the decentralized space? Top Accumulations in the Last 24 Hours The last day has seen a significant accumulation across various sectors, with AI and gaming leading the charge in our inquiries. There are four key categories where we see substantial wallet activity: 1. AI-driven projects 2. AI agents 3. Real-World Asset Tokenization (RWA) 4. MEMEs (not what you might expect in a bear market, but here we are!) AI and Gaming: A Growing Trend One of the most remarkable accumulations was seen in $GAI, the token behind @GAI_meme, which serves as the first launchpad for Gaming AI Agents on Base. This platform enables AI to generate custom games, a feature that has drawn significant attention from developers and investors alike. In the past 24 hours, six smart money wallets have accumulated a total of $15,000 worth of $GAI tokens, reflecting a market cap of $153K. This level of interest suggests that there’s a growing excitement about the intersection of gaming and artificial intelligence—that investors are positioning themselves early in a sector that seems ripe for future growth. The concept of AI in gaming isn’t novel, but projects like $GAI are taking it to the next level, creating possibilities beyond what we could have envisioned until now. An emphasis on AI-powered, user-generated content is what could push the gaming world to real-time personalization of all things core to the gaming experience. If $GAI isn’t quite doing that yet, it’s at least setting the stage for an era where that becomes standard. AI Agents: The Future of Automation Trailing not far behind is $AIXCB—a project spearheaded by @aixbt_project. This platform, centered on AI-driven projects, is now in the sights of smart money investors. Three separate smart money wallets have recently accumulated 20k worth of tokens, which bumps this project’s market cap to $6.2 million. As you can see, this is hardly a top project in the crypto market, but it is gaining attention—rightly so, in my opinion, because AI is the dominant theme in the crypto space right now and is a much-discussed area of research. The infusion of AI into the cryptocurrency network, especially with the creation of AI agents, has the chance to effect a paradigm shift. These autonomous agents can handle jobs, make decisions, and even interact with decentralized protocols, all without any human oversight. And that is exactly what has investors so interested in this development—because it has the potential to make decentralized networks vastly more efficient, scalable, and secure. Real-World Asset Tokenization: Bridging Traditional and Blockchain Finance Smart money is also pouring into Real World Asset (RWA) Tokenization, with $WHITE, the token for @WhiteRock_Fi, seeing a strong accumulation. This project aims to bridge the gap between traditional finance and blockchain by having a tokenization solution for real-world assets. One wallet that is obviously very smart has accumulated $9,500 worth of $WHITE tokens, and this project is now rocking a $586 million market cap. Smart money wallets accumulations in the last 24 hours Main specific narratives accumulated: AI and Gaming (10 wallets) AI Agents (6 wallets) Real-World Asset Tokenization (3 wallets) MEME (2 wallets) Top accumulations and reasoning: $GAI -> @GAI_meme is the… pic.twitter.com/nw3gOkk62n — CoinSense.app (@CoinSense_App) March 14, 2025 RWA tokenization is the next logical step in blockchain maturation. It’s a way to represent real-world assets, like real estate or commodities, on the blockchain. This sector’s development seems sure to catch the eyes of institutional investors and other big capital pools. Benefits it offers include increased liquidity, easier transfer of ownership, and the possibility of fractional ownership. MEME Coins: The Resilience of Popular Culture Certainly, the MEME segment continues to be a substantial market participant, with astute capital wagering on the enduring nature of established communities. $PEPE, a highly popular meme coin with a substantial number of followers, had one such wallet accumulate $9,600 worth of tokens. This brought its market cap to $3.04 billion. Despite the origins of its name, $PEPE has also made substantial cultural inroads in the space, attracting real and virtual retail investors as well as institutional ones. Meme coins have shown to be sturdy for the most part. This sturdiness can be attributed mainly to two features: the community aspect and the viral potential that these coins usually have. Take, for example, $PEPE. This token, in my opinion, is one of the best tokens that you can find in the meme coin space. This is because this token has not only a dedicated fanbase but also something that is becoming increasingly evident—mainstream awareness. The Big Picture: Smart Money Shows Confidence in Diversified Sectors The recent gathering of funds across these four sectors–AI and gaming, AI agents, RWA tokenization, and MEME–shows that smart-money investors aren’t just in it for a quick return. They’re seeing long-term value in projects that are innovating in important spaces, from artificial intelligence to the old-school finance world meeting up with blockchain. With the development of AI and gaming projects and the tokenization of RWAs, the very exciting, rapidly growing transformations we are witnessing in decentralized finance are equally set to take place in traditional finance. Meme coins, as we say, in a world of unpredictability offer a kind of reliable unpredictability now. In a world where we can’t really know what anything is worth, the sustained interest in both IRL and digital tokens makes us sure they’re worth something. That sustained interest seems like too much fun to think what we might be really paying in the future to hold our place in the fun house. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Interest in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is mounting across the crypto landscape as the third phase of its presale races for completion. And have secured $3.6 million from early backers and now have 5,800 token holders. the current price of $0.02 per MUTM for the project is attracting attention as a strategic entry point. Phase three is filling swiftly before its fourth stage, at which point prices will rise to $0.025 — a 25% jump for existing investors. Ethereum Approaches Key Resistance Levels Ethereum price action shows an ongoing battle between accumulation and profit taking. Exchange netflows — which can track ETH’s movements from wallets into exchanges and vice-versa — reveal investors withdrew 250,000 ETH in early 2025, indicating bullish sentiment similar to that of the accumulation phase during 2021. But the $1,850-$1,900 range is still a battleground, and $87.62 million in leveraged positions carries the risk of liquidation if volatility increases. ETH is currently priced at $1,894.11 and must overcome $1,985.53 for 64.54% of holders to be in profit. Falling below $1,800 could cause a cascade of sell-offs, testing support close to $1,700. Ripple Bounces on Macroeconomic Tailwinds XRP climbed 18% this week, to $2.24, as inflation data cooled, bolstering expectations of a pause in Federal Reserve rate hikes. The optimism is echoed in derivatives markets: open interest rose 3.48% to $3.05 billion while a long/short ratio of 2.49 from Binance proves stubbornly bullish positions remain dominant. A clear break above $2.50 would open targets at around $3, but overhanging resistance at $2.34 weighs on short-term expectations. Meanwhile, developments in Ripple’s court battle with the SEC — said to be close to a settlement — and Franklin Templeton’s XRP ETF application have added some fundamental heft. The Mutuum Finance Presale Momentum Builds As phase three approaches its funding cap, investor appetite has heated up for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . The tiered presale structure of the project guarantees for each phase progressively higher by having the first phase at $0.01, the second phase at $0.015, and the third at $0.02 before jumping 25% in phase four. Those early investors not only receive instant paper profits but a launch valuation of 200% — a ratio grounded in transparent tokenomics rather than speculative vapour. Once launched, MUTM’s $0.06 listing price will serve as a floor for returns, but the forecasts go even further. Demand could ascend toward $3.60 on platform adoption and its buy-and-distribute mechanism, which directs revenue to token buybacks. The utility of mtTokens’ yield-producing features and overcollateralized lending combined with this model gives MUTM dual-threat asset status: A presale asset with true DeFi legs. Emphasis on Security Excellence and Scalability The audit by an industry-leading blockchain security firm of Muutum Finance, indicates that investor concerns on smart contract risks have been duly attended to. As well its planned stablecoin — collateralized by a diversified basket of assets — aims to enhance ecosystem utility while hewing to the decentralist principles of DeFi. This layered approach to innovation sets MUTM apart from speculative assets driven by memes, as it enhances the mutual utility of the multi-asset mutual fund while addressing liquidity premiums and facilitating passive income generation. Timing Aligns With Opportunity While Ethereum and Ripple face headwinds specific to their respective markets, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is crystallizing its appeal in the crypto space with its structured growth and operational clarity. The ever-decreasing timeframe for purchasing MUTM at $0.02 highlights the need-to-know urgency: the swift pace of phase three fill rates could even foreshadow the extinction of early-stage opportunities. As phase four’s price increase looms and launch appreciation is secured, investors have a narrow window in which to seize this strategic entry.

Former U.S. President Donald Trump has announced his intention to speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin on March 18 to discuss ending the ongoing war in Ukraine. Could this conversation be a turning point, and what does it mean for your crypto portfolio? Let’s dive into the details and explore the potential market impact . Why Trump-Putin Peace Talks Matter for Cryptocurrency While seemingly distant from the digital currency realm, geopolitical events have a profound and often immediate impact on financial markets, and cryptocurrency is no exception. The Russia-Ukraine conflict has already demonstrated this, contributing to market volatility and influencing investor sentiment. A discussion aimed at resolving this conflict, especially one involving figures as prominent as Trump and Putin, injects a new element of uncertainty – or perhaps, hope – into the global equation. Here’s why this news is relevant to you as a crypto holder: Geopolitical Risk and Market Volatility: Cryptocurrency, while often touted as a hedge against traditional market instability, is not immune to broader geopolitical risk . Events like wars, political tensions, and international crises can trigger significant market fluctuations. Any perceived escalation or de-escalation in global conflicts directly affects investor confidence and risk appetite, leading to shifts in asset allocation. Global Stability and Investor Sentiment: Global stability is a cornerstone of healthy financial markets. Prolonged conflicts erode investor confidence, leading to risk-off behavior. Conversely, any indication of progress towards peace can boost market optimism. A Trump-Putin discussion, even if just a conversation, is being interpreted by some as a potential step towards de-escalation, which could positively influence market sentiment. Safe Haven vs. Risk Asset: The role of cryptocurrency as a safe haven asset is constantly debated. In times of extreme uncertainty, some investors flock to assets perceived as safe havens. However, during periods of heightened geopolitical risk , crypto can also behave like a risk asset, experiencing sell-offs alongside stocks and other volatile markets. The outcome of these peace talks could sway crypto’s perception and behavior in the short to medium term. Economic Fallout and Inflation: The Ukraine war has had significant global economic consequences, including supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures. These factors directly influence monetary policy and investor decisions. Any progress towards peace could ease some of these pressures, potentially impacting inflation expectations and the broader economic outlook, which in turn affects cryptocurrency valuations. Decoding the Potential Market Impact of Trump-Putin Talks So, what kind of market impact can we anticipate from this Trump-Putin dialogue? Predicting market reactions with certainty is impossible, especially in the crypto space known for its volatility. However, we can consider a few potential scenarios: Scenario Potential Crypto Market Reaction Contributing Factors Optimistic Outcome (Perceived progress in peace talks) Positive – Potential price surge in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Increased investor confidence and risk appetite. Positive news headlines, reduced geopolitical tensions, increased inflow of funds into risk assets. Neutral Outcome (Talks happen, but no immediate breakthroughs) Mixed/Neutral – Market may remain volatile but largely unchanged in the short term. Focus shifts back to other market drivers like inflation data and regulatory news. Uncertainty persists, market awaits concrete actions, other economic factors regain prominence. Pessimistic Outcome (Talks fail or escalate tensions) Negative – Potential price drop across crypto markets. Increased risk aversion, flight to safety towards traditional assets or stablecoins. Negative news flow, heightened geopolitical tensions, increased market fear and uncertainty. It’s crucial to remember that the crypto market is influenced by a multitude of factors. While the Trump-Putin discussion is a significant event, its market impact will be intertwined with other ongoing narratives, such as inflation rates, interest rate hikes, regulatory developments, and technological advancements in the crypto space itself. Navigating Geopolitical Risk in Your Crypto Strategy How can you, as a crypto investor, navigate this period of geopolitical risk and potential market volatility? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on news related to the Ukraine war, the Trump-Putin discussion, and broader geopolitical developments. Reputable news sources and crypto market analysis platforms can provide valuable updates. Diversify Your Portfolio: Diversification is key in volatile times. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Consider diversifying across different cryptocurrencies and potentially allocating a portion of your portfolio to less volatile assets. Manage Risk: Understand your risk tolerance. Geopolitical events can trigger sharp market swings. Consider setting stop-loss orders or reducing your exposure if you are uncomfortable with high volatility. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that cryptocurrency is still a relatively young and evolving asset class. Short-term market fluctuations driven by geopolitical events are part of the journey. Maintain a long-term perspective and focus on the fundamental value and potential of your chosen crypto projects. Consider Stablecoins: In times of heightened uncertainty, stablecoins pegged to fiat currencies can offer a safe haven within the crypto ecosystem. They can be a useful tool to reduce volatility in your portfolio during turbulent periods. The Quest for Global Stability and its Crypto Connection The aspiration for global stability is not just a political ideal; it’s a fundamental prerequisite for sustained economic growth and healthy financial markets. The cryptocurrency market, while often seen as a disruptive force, is ultimately interconnected with the broader global economic and political landscape. Progress towards resolving conflicts like the war in Ukraine is a positive sign for overall global stability , and could create a more favorable environment for all asset classes, including cryptocurrency. The Trump-Putin discussion on March 18 is undoubtedly a noteworthy event. Whether it will lead to a significant breakthrough in the Ukraine conflict remains to be seen. However, its potential to influence market impact , investor sentiment, and the trajectory of the cryptocurrency market is undeniable. As crypto investors, staying informed, adapting to evolving geopolitical realities, and maintaining a balanced perspective are crucial in navigating these uncertain times.

This cautious approach of our major investors was further indicated by the inflows into only a few select memecoins. The overall trend here was definitely an outflow, which pointed towards an increasing appetite for something else outside of the memecoin space. Was it a movement back into Bitcoin? Was it major investors looking to route capital around into phase 2 of the next bull run? Whatever the reason, the nominal shift definitely took some wind out of the sails of the memecoin market. A Detailed Look at the Flow of Funds The memecoin market saw a total trading volume of $3.75 million on March 13, 2025, but this market experienced a very substantial net outflow of $1.8 million. And what was driving this outflow? Well, there was an outflow of $2.8 million and an inflow of just $958.1K. These figures suggest that the overall inclination of investors around that time was decidedly toward selling or trimming the memecoins they were holding. Although the overall trend is negative, some memecoins did see significant inflows, indicating that parts of the market are still attractive to investors. The memecoins attracting the most attention included $UFD, $SNAI, $PWEASE, #GRIFFAIN, and $BMT. Each of these tokens saw inflows in the range of $30,000 to $63,000, which suggests that some investors are making bets that these particular assets are either long-term plays or short-term trading opportunities. Memecoins Seeing Inflows: Speculative Moves and Hopes for Quick Returns The inflows were focused predominantly on just a few of the tokens that seem to have galvanized the memecoin community. For instance, $UFD saw inflows of $39.1K, while $SNAI was not far behind with $30.2K. Another clear standout was $PWEASE, the popular memecoin associated with U.S. Vice President JD Vance, which attracted a notable $63.3K in inflows—clearly riding the wave of a recent price uptick. Overall, the pretty clear takeaway here is that inflows are coming to the market and, at least for now, seem largely to be pumping up a handful of tokens that have found favor among the memecoin community. Recap:Smart money on chain activities in the memecoin market for 13/03/25 Yesterday, there was more outflow than inflow Inflow: $958.1k Outflow: $2.8M Volume: $3.75M Net Volume: -$1.8M There was inflow into: $UFD ($39.1K) $SNAI ($30.2K) $PWEASE ($63.3K) #GRIFFAIN ($50.9K)… pic.twitter.com/x8nUxUEsLk — Stalkchain (@StalkHQ) March 14, 2025 #GRIFFAIN and $BMT also saw some inflows, with $50.9K and $48.2K entering their respective markets. These tokens, while not as widely recognized as others in the memecoin space, appear to be gaining some attention from smart money, likely due to either their novelty or the speculative opportunities they present in the current market environment. This suggests that a subset of investors is willing to bet on the success of lesser-known memecoins in the hopes of achieving quick profits. Memecoins Seeing Outflows: Caution and Profit-Taking In contrast, there were many larger, more established memecoins that saw significant outflows. The largest outflow was associated with $FARTCOIN, which lost $1.4 million, indicating that investors were taking profits or battening down the hatches in anticipation of a possible market downturn. Other tokens that experienced net outflows included $ARC, with $227.3K bailing, and $FAT, which saw $57.9K leave its coffers. In the meantime, the infamous memecoins GIGA and WBTC had outflows too, but theirs was the smallest of the bunch at $53.8K and $187.4K. Still, these outflows from even more prominent memecoins suggest a more risk-averse attitude among investors, who might be worried about the sustainability of current price levels. The Bigger Picture: A Market in Flux The ner… and volatility; smart money flows are pointing to a more cautious outlook. Some tokens are still seeing investment, but the overall trend is toward outflows—indicating that some investors are either taking profits or pulling back on risk exposure. That is the kind of behavior you expect from a speculative market highly sensitive to short-term price movements. Over the next few weeks, we can expect the memecoin sector’s individual tokens to largely track overall market sentiment. If you think the meme token economy might be heading for a tropical paradise of community engagement and ongoing project hype, it’s still far from a certainty. Cryptos in the memecoin sector are well-known for their volatility. Even tokens that seem to be riding the meme wave well aren’t safe from sharp market corrections. As we progress further into 2025, it will be intriguing to observe whether this outflow trend persists or the market swings back to a more optimistic outlook, with cash again flowing into the memecoin domain. For the moment, the prevailing sentiment among investors who are almost surely of the “smart money” variety seems to favor sitting on the sidelines, with these individuals taking a “wait and see” stance on how the market develops in the near future.

41796700,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=140620,1742196783,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Groundbreaking South Korea Crypto Bill: Unleashing Corporate Investment in Bitcoin and Ethereum,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/south-korea-corporate-crypto-bill/,"Get ready for a potential game-changer in the crypto world! South Korea, a nation known for its tech-forward approach and vibrant cryptocurrency market, is taking a monumental step towards mainstream crypto adoption. A new bill has been introduced by the ruling People Power Party (PPP) that could dramatically alter the landscape of corporate crypto investment in the country. What does this mean for the future of digital assets in South Korea and beyond? Let’s dive into the details of this exciting development. What’s the Buzz About the South Korea Crypto Bill? For the first time in South Korea’s 22nd National Assembly, which commenced on May 30, 2024, a bill has been put forward to officially permit corporate crypto investment . This landmark legislation, championed by Jung Sung-kook of the ruling People Power Party (PPP), aims to amend the Financial Investment Services and Capital Markets Act. The core of the amendment lies in reclassifying virtual assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) as legitimate ‘properties’ that asset management companies can invest in. This might sound like a technicality, but it’s a HUGE leap forward. Why is this reclassification so significant? Opening Doors to Institutional Money: By recognizing cryptocurrencies as investable properties, the bill paves the way for institutional investors and corporations to allocate funds into the crypto market through regulated channels. Facilitating Crypto ETFs: Perhaps the most anticipated outcome is the potential for spot crypto ETFs . Currently, South Korea, like many other regions, has been hesitant about approving spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. This bill directly addresses this by making it legally feasible for asset managers to include these digital assets in ETF products. Boosting Market Confidence: Legal clarity and institutional participation often lead to increased market confidence. This move could signal to both domestic and international investors that South Korea is serious about embracing the future of finance. Unpacking Corporate Crypto Investment: Benefits and Challenges The prospect of allowing corporate crypto investment in South Korea brings with it a wave of potential benefits, but also some challenges that need careful consideration. Potential Benefits: Increased Liquidity and Market Depth: Corporate investment can inject significant capital into the crypto market, leading to higher liquidity and making it easier for traders to execute large orders without causing drastic price swings. Mainstream Adoption: When corporations start investing in cryptocurrencies, it sends a powerful signal of legitimacy to the broader public. This can accelerate mainstream adoption and integration of digital assets into the financial system. Innovation and Growth in the Crypto Ecosystem: Increased capital flow can fuel innovation within the crypto space. Companies may be more inclined to develop new products and services around cryptocurrencies, fostering growth and expansion of the ecosystem. Portfolio Diversification for Corporations: Cryptocurrencies, with their low correlation to traditional assets, can offer corporations a valuable tool for portfolio diversification, potentially enhancing returns and managing risk. Potential Challenges: Regulatory Oversight and Compliance: As corporate crypto investment grows, robust regulatory frameworks are essential to protect investors and prevent illicit activities. Ensuring compliance with evolving regulations can be complex for businesses. Volatility and Risk Management: The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility. Corporations venturing into this space need to have robust risk management strategies in place to navigate price fluctuations and potential market downturns. Custody and Security Concerns: Safely storing and managing large amounts of cryptocurrency assets is a critical challenge for corporations. Secure custody solutions and robust security protocols are paramount to prevent theft and loss. Accounting and Tax Implications: The accounting and tax treatment of cryptocurrencies are still evolving in many jurisdictions. Corporations need clear guidelines and expertise to handle the financial reporting and tax obligations associated with crypto investments. Crypto ETFs: The Gateway to Broader Investment? The proposed bill is particularly exciting because of its potential to unlock crypto ETFs in South Korea. Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are investment vehicles that track the price of an underlying asset or index and are traded on stock exchanges. They offer a convenient and regulated way for investors to gain exposure to an asset class without directly owning the asset itself. Why are Crypto ETFs so sought after? Feature Spot Crypto ETFs Traditional Crypto Investment Accessibility Easily accessible through brokerage accounts, familiar to traditional investors. Requires setting up crypto exchange accounts and managing wallets, can be complex for newcomers. Regulation & Security Operates within established regulatory frameworks, offering investor protection. Regulation varies, security risks associated with self-custody and exchange vulnerabilities. Liquidity High liquidity due to exchange trading, easy to buy and sell. Liquidity can vary depending on the cryptocurrency and exchange. Tax Efficiency (Potentially) Tax treatment may be similar to traditional ETFs in some jurisdictions. Tax implications can be more complex and vary depending on the type of crypto transaction. If South Korea approves crypto ETFs , it could significantly broaden access to crypto investments for both retail and institutional investors. It would also align South Korea with other jurisdictions that are increasingly exploring and approving crypto ETFs, potentially boosting its competitiveness in the global digital asset market. Bitcoin Investment and Ethereum Investment: Leading the Charge The bill specifically mentions Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) as virtual assets eligible for corporate investment, recognizing their status as the two largest and most established cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. This focus on Bitcoin investment and Ethereum investment is strategic for several reasons: Market Dominance and Maturity: Bitcoin and Ethereum have demonstrated greater market resilience and maturity compared to many other cryptocurrencies. Their established track records make them more palatable for institutional investors seeking relatively lower-risk crypto exposure. Institutional Demand: There is significant pent-up institutional demand for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Many corporations and asset managers have expressed interest in allocating a portion of their portfolios to these digital assets, and this bill could provide the regulatory green light they’ve been waiting for. Foundation for a Broader Crypto Market: Starting with Bitcoin and Ethereum can serve as a solid foundation for gradually expanding corporate investment to other cryptocurrencies in the future, as the market matures and regulatory clarity improves. The potential influx of Bitcoin investment and Ethereum investment from corporations in South Korea could have a substantial positive impact on the prices and overall market sentiment for these leading cryptocurrencies. What’s Next? The introduction of this bill is a significant first step. It will now go through the legislative process, including committee reviews and votes in the National Assembly. While the bill is spearheaded by the ruling party, it will be crucial to watch for cross-party support and any potential amendments as it progresses. For crypto enthusiasts and investors, this development is undoubtedly exciting. It signals a potential shift in South Korea’s stance towards cryptocurrency regulation and could position the nation as a key player in the global digital asset landscape.

There is now an active ‘man-hunt’ to stop the perpetrator in its tracks. According to data on Hypurrscan, on Mar. 17 at 6:30 AM UTC, the whale just closed two positions through Time-Weighted Average Price or TWAP for a combined 208 BTC ( BTC ) at a price of $83,392. The total worth of both transactions is equal to more than $18 million. At 4:30 AM UTC, the anonymous trader added $7.5 million in collateral to their Bitcoin short position to avoid being liquidated by the margin on Hyperliquid. On-chain data shows that the trader has accumulated a loss of nearly $1.1 million from unrealized profit and loss or PNL. This whale still managed to turn a profit despite being hunted by a team! 11 hours ago, @Cbb0fe publicly formed a team to hunt this whale who shorted $BTC with 40x leverage. Just one hour later, the team was in action, driving $BTC above $84,690 in a short period. The whale… pic.twitter.com/D6FBOFikZR — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) March 17, 2025 At the moment, the trader’s current position stands at 5,167 BTC, with a value of around $429 million. The short position stands at 40x leverage and has an unrealized profit of $4 million. Simultaneously the trader also has a long position with 5x leverage for 571,715 MELANIA ( MELANIA ) valued at $390,000. You might also like: Binance adjusts leverage on multiple perpetual contracts, raising TRUMP to 50x The whale first started its enormous short position in Bitcoin on Mar. 16. At the time, a crypto trader on X with the username @Cbb0fe or CBB detected the whale’s suspicious activity and called for other traders to join a public manhunt to liquidate the whale’s position before it could cause more harm to the ecosystem. “If you are willing to hunt this dude with size, drop a DM, setting up a team right now and already got good size,” said CBB on their post . In a separate post, CBB told traders to message them with “7 figs size only” as the combined funds of the team had already exceeded eight figures. An hour after the team was formed, they managed to drive up the market price of Bitcoin from $83,183 to more than $84,690. As a result, the whale was forced to deposit $5 million in USDC ( USDC ) to increase its margin and avoid liquidation. However, the manhunt has yet to success as the whale continues to evade liquidation by boosting its position to short BTC through TWAP. Hyperliquid’s official account also recently commented on the viral bear trader’s activity on-chain, describing how the protocol has become synonymous with “the market” as it has garnered significant attention from the crypto community. “When a whale shorts $450M+ BTC and wants a public audience, it’s only possible on Hyperliquid,” wrote the account. Earlier this month, on March 12, a whale began a long position on Hyperliquid with 50x leverage for 175,000 ETH ( ETH ) worth $340 million. Due to the large liquidation amount, Hyperliquid was forced to absorb the position at $1,915 in an effort to liquidate it. As a result, Hyperliquid lost more than $4 million.

Not long ago, $GOAT was riding high, crossing the $1 billion market cap, and looked to many like a serious contender for the pantheon of promising investments. Capturing the imagination of traders and investors alike, the token seemed like a one-way bet to the top. But in the space of about one month, it saw a staggering decline that set it tumbling to a mere $56.4 million market cap. What in the world happened? What catastrophic flip of the switch brought about this most talkative token’s talkative demise? Will it even be remembered as a token, or will it only be remembered as a symbol of the unpredictable nature of the digital asset market? Bottom line: Can we hedge against the risk of holding tokens for the long term? The Rise: A Token on the Verge of Greatness At its peak, $GOAT was among the rare tokens on the Pumfun exchange that had successfully crossed the $1 billion mark for market capitalization. It had all the elements for success: a name you couldn’t forget, a link to cutting-edge AI technology, and the sheer excitement that propels crypto prices to new records. If anything, $GOAT’s status as a “memecoin” only enhanced its profile. The token raked in huge amounts of attention from investors rushing to assemble portfolios of AI-driven assets. The coin stirred excitement from the outset. For a long time, it looked as if it were an inevitable upward path, with the crypto recovering from downward corrections to soaring heights that seemed more guaranteed with each passing day. The $GOAT token was no exception. Its Friday high price looked more than likely to realize another weekend run not seen in this space for months. And with the promise of an NFT drop possibly today, the topaz coin that works with the Ethereum smart contract seemingly found a historical moment for propelling itself to even further heights. The Fall: A Sudden and Harsh Decline Yet again, we see that in the crypto world, there are no extended good times. Suddenly and harshly, $GOAT has begun to move in the opposite direction, and its current value is a shadow of what it once was. Today, we find it at a market cap of just $56.4 million, after a drop that has left just about no one touched with a warm, fuzzy feeling. $GOAT once a shining star among AI tokens One of the few coins on Pumfun to cross the $1B marketcap is now a shadow of its former self. Goat is now at $56.4M and has lost about 95.65% of its value. Holders count is presently at 88,394 and sol liquidity is worth $1.27M meaning… pic.twitter.com/ufvCz3crup — Stalkchain (@StalkHQ) March 14, 2025 That’s a heart-stopping, gut-wrenching drop of 95.65% since the only time it was ever worth more. $GOAT didn’t go down quickly but rather fell, and that falling is a wake-up call for folks in the crypto world. Goats don’t stay on top for long. They climb high and then come down fast. Whatever $GOAT’s actual price is (or was), it appeared to some (and surely to many $GOAT holders) that the price reflected a rocket on the rise. Then it looked like a mountain when it was really just a hill. When it went over the top, then it came down and down and down to where we are now. And what are we now? We are not on top of the GOAT. The GOAT is falling.Maconline.com keeps saying so. When the GOAT’s falling, crypto’s going with it. And when is crypto not going with it? That’s another question. One critical factor behind the collapse of $GOAT is its dwindling liquidity. With only $1.27 million in liquidity and 88,394 holders, the marketplace for $GOAT is extremely shallow. That limited liquidity makes it hard for investors to sell their stakes without meaningfully moving the price—and when that happens, it really does feel like the thing is collapsing, and it starts to look like there’s not much in the way of support, which of course invites more selling. A Lesson Learned: Trading vs. Holding Long-Term Key lessons messaged by the demise of $GOAT: Crypto trading can be more profitable than HODLing (holding long term). This is especially true for tokens that lack strong fundamentals. In the space of crypto KOLs (key opinion leaders), there’s mostly a vibe of profiting on the short-term ups and downs of the market. Holding tends to be viewed as a short way of saying “dumb strategies.” And trading, of course, isn’t risk-free. Although it can be a rewarding strategy for some, holding has significant risks. Tokens such as $GOAT, which have none of the fundamental strength that a development team, a set of solid partnerships, or a useful presence in the real world might provide, are particularly vulnerable to the kinds of wild and unsustainable price swings that we saw in the last bull run and that some of us might hope never to see again. Given those price swings and the missed opportunities they represent, you might wonder why anyone would even think about holding for the long term. It is most important to evaluate the fundamentals behind any project if you are an asset holder. Look closely at these elements: – Use case: Does the project have strong, demonstrated use cases? – Team: Is the project team credible? – Partnerships: Are there partnerships in place that could drive significant value, or at least some value, to this project? It’s clear that determining the answers to these questions is essential if you want to stand a chance of picking a cryptocurrency that will exist, in any form, five years from now. To summarize, the collapse of $GOAT reminds us of the risks we take in the cryptocurrency market. When you invest in crypto, you have the chance to see huge profits, but there’s also a real possibility that you’ll lose it all. If you’re going to play in this space, first understand that the trends we see often don’t last long. Second, have confidence in either what you’re trading or what you’re holding for the long term—because in crypto, nothing is guaranteed. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Beosin’s sleuthing has revealed what could well be potential price manipulation schemes, and they’ve connected the dots to market makers and certain addresses that seem to be linked to @myshell_ai. What’s more, Beosin Trace says these transactions were intimately tied to some very significant price swings experienced by the $SHELL token itself. The series of large transfers of $SHELL tokens between different addresses are analyzed here. Multiple transfers to hot wallets associated with major crypto exchanges are numerous. Most of those transfers and many of the occurrences seem to be part of a coordinated effort to attack the price of the token before it is listed. This heist raises some serious questions about the market conditions leading up to the listing. The Suspicious Transactions Behind $SHELL’s Price Surge One of Beosin’s most alarming findings is that more than $1 million worth of $SHELL tokens was transferred just minutes before the token was listed on Binance Spot. Beosin’s Trace report states that at 19:08:19 on February 27, 2025 (UTC+8), Address 2, linked to @myshell_ai, sent 1,538,462 $SHELL tokens to a user at a Binance address, valued at around $1 million. This transfer happened some 112 minutes before the token’s official listing on Binance Spot, and it smells a lot like a last-minute pump before the token started trading. This suspicious transfer was not an isolated event. Between 20:19 and 20:40 (UTC+8) on the same day, Address 3 (0xf60b) and a Bitget hot wallet executed a series of transfers, moving a total of 5,829,159.2 $SHELL tokens—worth around $3.5 million—to another Binance user address. The timing and magnitude of these transactions raise concerns about the role of market makers in potentially orchestrating these moves to drive up the token’s price before its exchange debut. A Web of Transactions Linked to Major Exchanges The transactions under suspicion were not restricted to just a single day. They spanned multiple days and involved numerous complex components. On February 14, 2025, the Safe Wallet identified with @myshell_ai (0x45ca) made a transfer of 500,000 $SHELL tokens to a Bitget user address (0x31034fb4a5212994f1540ab7067f721f152421ac). This transfer was in two parts: 500,000 $SHELL tokens (Ethereum) and the same amount (500,000 $SHELL tokens), but this time, in the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) version. Now, the next day, on February 13, 2025, we find Address 3 (0xf60b) involved in different parts of a similar scheme: on this occasion, moving and then retransferring $SHELL tokens to and from various wallets such that, in the end, it appears that another 500,000 $SHELL tokens (again, both the Ethereum and BSC versions) were moved to nearly the same Bitget user address as in the earlier transaction. Moreover, Address 3 (0xf60b) sent an incredible 5 million $SHELL tokens to 0xc606, which, in turn, transferred 2.5 million of those tokens to 0x89fe. Then, on March 11, 0x89fe deposited 612,913.95 $SHELL tokens into another Bitget user address, 0xf8706f1e4c4502b7cc5eb1b6140f6de5324e2bd4. These trades done by different addresses controlled by the same user, done right before $SHELL is listed on exchanges, make a very compelling case that these market makers were the ones that moved the price up before exchanges listed $SHELL. 1/ Beosin has released an insightful on-chain analysis of $Shell to reveal suspicious token price manipulation by market makers. Here is an easy-to-understand thread of it pic.twitter.com/49QF9vAxMn — Beosin Web3 Security & Compliance (@Beosin_com) March 15, 2025 Implications for the $SHELL Token and the Broader Crypto Market Beosin’s analysis of $SHELL’s price manipulation spotlights a potentially troubling trend of market manipulation using coordinated token transfers. The actions uncovered in the report demonstrate how market makers can use their control over token movements and access to large exchanges to pump up the price of a token before its public listing. The exposure of these dubious activities could injure the $SHELL token’s reputation and trust in the market. Even let us say that it had a beautiful rise in value following its initial exchange listings. The overall market is so jittery right now that any hint of negative news can lead to a price drop, let alone a surge in apparent token value that is based on good ol’ fashioned manipulation. This incident additionally provokes wider worries about how vulnerable the crypto space is to market manipulation. As cryptocurrencies increasingly become part of the global financial system, the necessity for regulatory oversight and, even more so, transparency in token listings is becoming more evident. This is especially true for tokens that are associated with larger blockchain projects, where any kind of market manipulation that happens can have a larger overall effect on the crypto space. The Role of Blockchain Auditing Firms in Enhancing Market Integrity To counteract the increasing dangers associated with token manipulation, blockchain security companies, such as Beosin, are vital for the fortification of market integrity. Thanks to their careful, on-chain investigations, they are able to pinpoint not just dubious behaviors but also potential weaknesses that exist within the market itself. Thus, they are a big part of making the greater crypto ecosystem a safer space for all involved. The crypto market is growing up and finding its place in the financial world. As it matures, it’s likely to attract the same level of scrutiny that traditional financial markets do—especially when it comes to possibly illegal activities like market manipulation. This week, the crypto forensic firm Beosin published a report about just how much manipulation (in terms of deceiving honest investors) still goes on in the crypto space, even as this supposedly largely lawless sector has been cleaned up a bit since last year. Beosin’s report is a good reminder that anything on a blockchain is not necessarily always above board. To sum up, Beosin’s recent on-chain analysis shines a light on possibly illegal or unethical goings-on with the $SHELL token’s price. The analysis, part of Beosin’s ongoing coverage of intriguing tokens, underlines the importance of knowing what’s really going on with a token before, say, buying it or putting it in a DeFi protocol. Indeed, the investigation found that the people buying the $SHELL token weren’t really buying something that was worth what they were paying. And some of those people might have been using the $SHELL token to pay for something other than the right to buy that token. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

It was said that XRP could be used for state-level financial transactions and optimizing government payments, ADA for academic credentialing, smart contracts for government services, and secure infrastructure, and SOL for high-speed blockchain applications like secure voting and digital identity management. However, these rumors were quickly shot down by the founder of CryptoLaw and pro-XRP lawyer, who clarified on social media that the SEC had not released any such information.

The order sparked interest in the market, as Trump named Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, Solana, and Cardano as the digital assets expected to be included in the reserve. However, the market was left disappointed after the announcement, as many were hoping for a concrete plan to buy new tokens. On March 7, President Donald Trump hosted a meeting with crypto executives at the White House for the first-ever Crypto Summit. During the summit, Trump and other cabinet officials met with key figures from the crypto industry to show continued support for the sector and gather ideas for future regulation and legislation. This event followed Trump’s recent Executive Order, which announced the creation of a federal Bitcoin reserve. However, when Trump first mentioned the idea earlier, there were concerns that he might raise taxes to buy crypto and that including smaller, more volatile coins like Cardano and XRP could pose risks.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,XRP|REGULATION|ADA|FIAT|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-17 07:41:40

We now stand at the threshold of an era where AI and blockchain technology can work together to create a buying and selling experience that is intuitive, safe, and efficient. Streamlining Luxury Car Transactions with AI and Blockchain At the cusp of entwining the blockchain technology with the luxury vehicle market is CryptoAutos, which now offers the ability to make purchases and sales of high-end cars using digital currencies like $PAAL. The partnership with PAAL AI, on the other hand, could take this company to the next level and edify the user experience with artificial intelligence (AI). CryptoAutos could become even more personalized, with AI helping to make the car-buying process not only more efficient but, one might hope, enjoyable as well. One of the key features enabled by the PAAL AI integration is the AI-powered customer assistance, which provides users with real-time support during the car-buying journey. Whether it’s answering questions, guiding users through the payment process, or offering tailored recommendations, the AI-driven assistance ensures that customers receive a seamless and hassle-free experience. Proud to collaborate w/ @CryptoAutos_ Integrating $PAAL payments into their cutting-edge platform! Get behind the wheel of luxury cars with $PAAL today. Crypto Autos is an innovative project that combines the world of cryptocurrency with the automotive industry, aiming to… https://t.co/DSYCJEgAQ0 — PAAL AI (@PaalMind) March 12, 2025 Furthermore, the automated luxury car recommendations function uses advanced algorithms to analyze user preferences and suggest vehicles that align with their specific tastes and needs. This ensures that buyers can find their ideal car with minimal effort. Yet another fascinating aspect of the PAAL AI integration is the custom Telegram bot built exclusively for the CryptoAutos community. Telegram is one of the most popular messaging platforms among cryptocurrency’s many fans and businesses, and the CryptoAutos bot will be a crucial interface for engaging with our platform. Be it for customer support, user transactions, or simply engaging with the latest platform developments—such as our recent on-platform rebranding—the bot will be an unobtrusive and seamless way for our users to buy and sell in the decentralized marketplace. A New Chapter for AI, Web3, and Real-World Assets The collaboration of PAAL AI and CryptoAutos marks a big step in combining AI, Web3, and real-world assets. As the blockchain and cryptocurrency businesses push into new sectors, they appear unable to stop invading the old marketplace. Using digital tools, they claim to be revolutionizing the traditional sector, which is 4.0. In this revolution’s name, they promise to transform everything. In this partnership, PAAL AI and CryptoAutos appear to be delivering a new luxury vehicle transaction experience. In this integrated system, users can expect scope, services tailored to their individual needs, and heightened security when conducting significant business, like trading in exotic automobiles. Paying with $PAAL tokens—and, for that matter, with any number of traditional currency options—means that luxury car deals are now not only but also. For PAAL AI, this integration marks yet another step forward in establishing its place as a dominant force in the AI-driven blockchain space. The company has already made a splash with its innovative ecosystem, which lets users create customized AI bots that can be deployed across several different platforms. By reaching out into the automotive sector, PAAL AI shows how its technology can be applied to all kinds of complex problems in all sorts of industries it hasn’t yet touched. The Future of Luxury Car Sales in the Web3 Era The partnership between PAAL AI and CryptoAutos spotlights a nexus where Web3 and AI meet—one that revolves around the traditional, often arcane, world of high-end automotive sales. These are events where huge sums of money change hands; where the demands of vanity, ego, and simple overindulgence mix; where concerns about security and privacy are all the greater for the absence of any mechanisms that enforce either. So is your luxury vehicle sale happening on a blockchain? If not, why not? In the not-too-distant future, this union may very well serve as a model for other industries that are trying to figure out how to harness the still-emerging AI and blockchain technologies. Meanwhile, as large segments of the global economy continue their transformation into a digital one, the luxury carmakers are very much in the vanguard of benefiting from this wave of new tech. And of all the recent technological developments, the auto industry stands to gain the most in implementing AI to personalize the car-buying experience and the use of blockchain technology to streamline the experience. To sum up, the conjunction of PAAL AI with CryptoAutos marks a major event in the sphere of luxury vehicle transactions. It is the world of next-generation AI where this new partnership, founded on the principles of blockchain technology, lives and breathes. With these key innovations very much in mind, we take a look at this new strategic alliance and the seamless platform it offers to users for executing digital transactions of high-end vehicles. Plenty more to come in terms of potential synergies among the worlds of crypto, cars, and AI. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

41797155,https://nulltx.com/?p=147146,1742197484,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Is Coinbase’s Recent Dip the Right Time to Buy?,https://nulltx.com/is-coinbases-recent-dip-the-right-time-to-buy/,"The leading U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase (COIN), has seen its stock plunge nearly 50% from its all-time highs. Many investors are asking whether this is the right time to buy or if the company’s future is less certain than it once seemed. Despite the significant drop in price, the fundamentals behind Coinbase remain as strong as ever. The company continues to grow its product offerings, secure regulatory victories, and see increasing adoption by institutional investors. When we dissect the main influences on Coinbase’s performance, we find that the current downturn is likely not a direct outcome of any decisions made by the company, but more of a market reaction to some broader driving factors. In this piece, we’ll explore the motivations behind the recent sell-off, assess how well we think Coinbase is positioned for growth in the future, and then try to determine if this current dip is a valid buying opportunity. Why the Sell-Off? Coinbase’s share price has dropped sharply, but a closer look shows that it is not just Coinbase, but also Bitcoin that has seen dramatic drops. As Coinbase states, “Bitcoin (BTC) has fallen approximately 30% from its highs.” And from my close watch over the years, I would have to say that on a not quite constant but definitely close to a 1:1 ratio, when Bitcoin drops, not just Coinbase, but the whole cryptocurrency market suffers and Coinbase’s price drops as well. $COIN is down nearly 50% from its highs, but the fundamentals have never looked stronger. SEC case dropped. Institutional adoption rising. A growing crypto product suite. Is this the dip to buy? Let’s break it down. pic.twitter.com/aADywSc4iG — Nansen (@nansen_ai) March 14, 2025 Moreover, the revenue that Coinbase receives from crypto trading is exceedingly responsive to the market’s condition. Trading volumes are down across the board. As a result, Q1 revenue is expected to be 14% lower than the previous quarter. This drop in earnings coincides with a broader adverse market sentiment, and it’s undoubtedly also contributing to our downward trajectory in price. However, we aren’t pessimistic about this short-term weakness necessarily indicating something long-term unfavorable. After all, in the Coinbase crypto trajectory, the context is one of growth, not decline, and the regulatory backdrop is increasingly favorable. A Positive Regulatory Shift for Coinbase The recent regulatory victory with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is one of the most substantial factors impacting the long-term outlook for Coinbase. After extended periods of murkiness and legal hurdles, the SEC has abandoned its case against Coinbase. This unfurling of events has paved the way for the exchange to start listing more tokens and to expand its offerings quite significantly. The removal of this precipitative cloud associated with a very significant part of the weather regulator section of the report seems pretty important. It seems to be a turning point. In addition, Coinbase is no longer simply responding to the regulatory environment; it is actively shaping U.S. crypto policy. With a U.S. administration in place that is pro-crypto, the environment for centralized exchanges (CEXs) like Coinbase is improving. As the company works more closely with regulators and policymakers, it could emerge as a key player in establishing clearer, more supportive regulations for the whole crypto industry. That strategic shift appears to position Coinbase for continued growth as the regulatory landscape becomes more favorable. Strong Fundamentals and Future Growth Potential Even with the crypto markets experiencing short-term volatility, Coinbase’s fundamentals remain impressive. The company has margins that would make many tech stocks envious, with operating margins that hover around 40%. That number, of course, is pre-tax, and the taxes Coinbase would pay if it were not based in San Francisco would probably lower its margins. All that said, 40% is an incredibly high operating margin and a sign that Coinbase is doing something right. Nonetheless, it is important to point out that around 60% of Coinbase’s earnings still arrive courtesy of cryptocurrency trading. That kind of sustained burn means dealing with a highly unstable crypto market, where low trading volumes in a bad quarter can be pretty much offset by higher trading volumes when the next bad quarter rolls around. Conversely, if good quarters become the new normal, then Coinbase has upside in terms of not just trading volumes but also increased revenues through what might be called its new normal windfall. Considering crypto trading, Coinbase isn’t merely an exchange to trade in digital currencies. It is broadening its product offerings, and by doing so is very much a player in the emerging industry of tokenized assets. From what they tell us, the audience for these products ranges from retail and individual investors to institutional players, with the latter being a much bigger audience than anyone thought possible just a few years ago. Is Now the Right Time to Buy? Because the market is undervaluing Coinbase’s long-term growth potential in the face of some short-term volatility, the current price could be a very attractive entry point for investors who are willing to risk a bet. Coinbase is leading in the adoption of cryptocurrencies by both retail and institutional investors. As the cryptocurrency market matures, Coinbase’s place among core, financial-platform providers for digital assets becomes clearer. Although every investment carries some danger, and especially in the volatile world of cryptocurrency, the recent dip in Coinbase’s stock price could give a false impression of the company’s overall health. The following three factors indicate that not only is Coinbase likely to make it through the current turbulence, it’s also in a prime position to come out stronger on the other side than it was before. To conclude, Coinbase’s fundamentals look better than ever, and the company’s recent win with regulators and its push for much wider adoption of crypto signal a bright future to us. The current market may be selling off, and it may be a painful experience in the short term for long-term investors, but it could just be the buy signal in a company we see as central to the future of finance.

The investor sentiment has improved as the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) records a massive surge in the meme coin activity led by Mubarak. As a result, the DEX volumes on BSC has reached a record high surpassing Solana. BNB Price Jumps 4.5% Eyes Fresh All time Highs Following the current development, the BNB price has shot up by 4.5% today while the broader crypto market is facing consolidation.At press time, BNB was trading at $628 with daily trading volume surging 21% to $1.75 billion. As per the Coinglass data , the BNB futures open interest is also up by 10.72% to $875 million, suggesting a bullish outlook among traders. Binance Coin or BNB price has broken out of a descending channel pattern on the 4-hour timeframe, according to crypto analyst Pro Crypto Signals. “If BNB sustains its position above the channel structure, it could rally toward $720 in the coming days,” the analyst noted. Source: Pro Crypto Signals However, for a strong rally ahead, the BNB price needs to break past the crucial resistance of $630. This will set the stage for a major rally to the fresh all-time highs of $720, and beyond. Additionally, last week’s reports also suggest that the Trump family is eyeing a stake in Binance.US. However, Changpeng Zhao dismissed the rumors very soon stating that the WSJ article has been putting misleading information. BNB Chain Surpasses Solana In DEX Trading Volume Over the last 24 hours, the decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume on BNB Chain has crossed an impressive $1.64 billion, surpassing Solana to grab the top spot. he surge was largely driven by memecoins like Mubarak. SourcE: LookonChain PancakeSwap, the leading DEX on BNB Chain, also emerged as the platform with the highest trading volume within the same period, solidifying its dominance in the DeFi space. This highlights the growing activity and interest in the BNB Chain ecosystem, fueled by memecoin trading and decentralized finance innovations.

In the meantime, BinanceCoin has gained the spotlight, recording decent gains compared to the other top 10 cryptos. The token has attracted more than 11% gains in the past seven days and nearly 5% in the past 24 hours. With the rise above $630 and a notable increase of over 25% in trading volume, the BNB price is expected to be the top performer among the large-cap cryptos in the upcoming days. BinanceSmart Chain TVL Surpass Solana BSC TVL is on the rise! In the past few months, the trading activity on Solana was extremely high. As a result, the platform surpassed the transaction volume, count, and TVL of popular chains like Ethereum. Meanwhile, BinanceSmart Chain (BSC) has surpassed Solana in terms of DEX volume and ranked first. Source: DefiLlama One of the reasons for the rapid increase is said to be an investment from Abu Dhabi-based MGX into Binance. Secondly, the sudden rise in the BSC-based tokens like Mubarak and Mashalla has also contributed to the BSC DEX volume. Once, Solana also experienced a similar rise, which faded with the drop of a couple of memecoin rug pulls. Therefore, with the rise of memecoin volume on BSC, there could be the possibility of another such event. How Will This Impact the BNB Price? BinanceCoin is known for its silent yet monstrous behavior, as it maintains a consistent rally without making a lot of noise. The price has risen to over $630 after rebounding from the lows close to $500. With this, the token is expected to break above the bearish pattern, which may help the BNB price to head towards new highs. As seen in the above chart, the BNB price broke down from the bullish pattern but remained within a descending parallel channel. Moreover, the 50-day and 200-day MAs underwent a bearish crossover, which is about to get reversed anytime from now. With this quick reversal, the price is expected to break the resistance of the descending channel and enter the rising parallel channel that it has held since August 2024.

In this event, they burned 31.15 million OKB tokens. They say that this takes the total burned number of OKB tokens up to 171 million, which is an impressive-sounding number. As the overall crypto market seems to be facing an extended downturn, it seems that exchanges like OKX are trying to use token scarcity as a way to maintain their tokens’ prices. OKX completed its 27th OKB token burn on March 14, burning 31,158,862 OKB worth $1.32 billion—a record high in both quantity and total value. So far, OKB has cumulatively burned 171 million tokens, leaving 129 million in circulation, for a 57.10% burn ratio. OKX previously stated… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 14, 2025 Implementing systematic burns of OKB is a key part of OKX’s strategy for managing supply and demand. This is unique to cryptocurrency exchanges, as most traditional financial markets cannot impact their asset’s supply like this. And under current regulatory scrutiny, most wouldn’t even attempt. Yet crypto exchanges can and do. They have a vested interest in ensuring that their tokens maintain value. And this is what makes the current strategy of OKX potentially harmful to both users and the larger market. Token Burns: A Deflationary Strategy to Combat Declining Spot Volumes OKX’s latest burn event comes at a time when spot trading volumes are declining across the major cryptocurrency exchanges. Conditions in the market are tough, buffeted by forces that are both global economic and long-term in nature, and a number of exchanges have been exploring user engagement ideas in an attempt to stop their partial vaporization. OKX has been implementing ideas to engage users, offering the chance to win the equivalent of $30,000 in Tether (USDT) as a carrot to keep its customers around for the kind of token burns that would partially inflate the value of the exchange’s ERC-20 token. These periodic burns create the illusion of scarcity, a tactic that can drive speculation and attract more investors. However, critics argue that while the short-term effects of such burns may be noticeable, the long-term impact on the overall value of a token remains uncertain. The burn strategy essentially works by buying back loyalty from token holders, particularly when the market sentiment is low and trading volumes are down. In times of low demand and declining prices, token burns act as a form of market manipulation—creating an artificial sense of value while the underlying fundamentals of the exchange and its offerings may not have changed drastically. These worries notwithstanding, token burns have established themselves as a useful tool in the crypto toolbox. For many projects that issue tokens, the act of burning those tokens is a way to create some short-term price action—positive price action, we should say—that keeps interest in the token alive even when the broader market is not so great. By reducing the total supply and keeping that even lower number in the public’s mind, these projects maintain the appearance of scarcity. OKX’s Ongoing Commitment to Deflationary Economics OKX has carried out numerous burn events over the years, with the most recent being just one among many. Through periodic burns, the exchange has eliminated a total of 171 million OKB tokens from circulation, showing a clear and sustained commitment to deflationary economics. This use of deflationary aspects in the perceived value of the native token aligns with a broader trend among crypto exchanges and projects seeking ways to increase the value of their tokens, attract new users, and retain existing ones amid uncertain market conditions. This strategy has its risks, as it can cause volatility and create a dependence on shifting short-term token prices. But for exchanges like OKX, which thrive on user engagement and participation, it’s an effective way to prop up token value in a bear market. And this approach fits well into the broader cryptocurrency narrative: if you can’t have it, you must want it. OKX and its rivals are in a space where they need to keep users close and keep them participating. Lopping off a sliver of a token here or there might do the trick in the short term—but it is, by far, not the most desirable method. Although the long-term effects of these token burns might not be fully realized yet, they are assuredly part of a large wave of efforts by cryptocurrency exchanges to raise the value of their tokens in the current bear market. They utilize them as deflationary mechanisms to try to create uppercase V, uppercase A, uppercase L, uppercase U, uppercase E in the eyes of anyone looking at their ecosystem—an utterly essential strategy when the overall market is looking sick. The Role of Exchanges in the Token Economy The most recent token burn from OKX emphasizes how much power cryptocurrency exchanges now wield over their native tokens. In traditional finance, there are laws that prevent companies from messing too much with supply and demand; otherwise, they’d just be burning money and creating inflation. But in crypto, it’s a different story. Exchanges can kind of do what they want with their native tokens, and they might as well use the tools at their disposal to make those tokens more appealing to buy and hold. That’s what OKX’s latest token burn seems to indicate. This power allows exchanges to control their tokenomics and create an environment where the value of their tokens can be manipulated to some degree. That kind of environment is especially valuable in a bear market when sentiment is otherwise hard to come by. While the long-term effects of these deflationary measures are yet to be fully understood, they are undoubtedly influencing the way that exchanges interact with their user bases and manage the economic forces that impact their tokens. To conclude, the 27th event of OKX’s token burn offers clear proof that exchanges are ramping up the use of deflationary strategies to influence the supply and demand of their tokens. By burning what constitutes a relatively large portion of its OKB supply, this exchange is propelling the demand and maintaining the value of its native token, all while market conditions are less than favorable for cryptocurrencies.

41797338,https://nulltx.com/?p=147144,1742197805,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,XRP Gains Major Recognition as U.S. and Dubai Embrace Ripple’s Digital Asset,https://nulltx.com/xrp-gains-major-recognition-as-u-s-and-dubai-embrace-ripples-digital-asset/,"In a groundbreaking move for the cryptocurrency industry, the SEC has now gone a step further to declare XRP as a “Strategic Asset for the U.S.” This appears to set the stage for a new era of digital asset integration, with the U.S. government now planning a pilot program to figure out the best way to use XRP within some of the most vital financial systems. According to the SEC document, XRP will not only serve in these pilot programs but also may wind up playing a key role in a ton of” core financial activities” in the U.S., such as tax refunds and social security, thereby becoming more integrated than ever into the U.S. financial infrastructure. Besides the increasing acceptance in the U.S., Ripple, the company behind XRP, has also received a substantial international boost. The Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) has given Ripple the thumbs-up to provide cryptographic payment and service solutions that use XRP in the region. These developments represent a watershed for both Ripple and the larger crypto industry. While some jurisdictions have grown shy about cryptocurrencies, XRP seems to be gaining traction in many international locales. XRP’s Role as a Strategic Asset in U.S. Financial Systems The recent SEC document, which officially designates XRP as a “Strategic Asset,” represents a major shift in the U.S. government’s view of cryptocurrencies. As part of this new initiative, the U.S. is set to launch a pilot program that aims to integrate XRP into key financial services, such as tax refunds and social security payments. This could have a huge ripple effect, as it would be a clear signal from the U.S. government that it is ready to use a digital asset in place of the dollars it normally uses to make such payments. BREAKING: The SEC posts $XRP document to website naming it as a 'Strategic Asset for the U.S."" The documents states that the U.S. will begin a pilot program to use $XRP for tax refunds and Social Security Integrations pic.twitter.com/GRlCugkgLy — CryptosRus (@CryptosR_Us) March 14, 2025 Including XRP in these pilot programs suggests that the potential benefits of digital currencies—namely, that they can help create faster, cheaper, and more efficient systems of payment—are something the U.S. government is bullish on. As we head into tax season, it’s likely that the pilot program will test the viability of XRP as a tool to facilitate tax refunds. From what we understand, the idea is to see if the currency can be used to send refunds in a way that is more streamlined and timely than what we’re currently doing. Also, could XRP be used to strengthen the systems that deliver social security payments? In a conversation with Ripple, I learned that using XRP for that purpose is something the company thinks can and should be done. This is a triumph for Ripple in its still-ongoing effort to create a bridge between the traditional financial system and blockchain technology. As more and more government entities look into using blockchain for public services, XRP stands to become a major tool in digital transformation within the public sector. Ripple Expands Reach with Dubai Approval XRP’s global acceptance extends well beyond the United States. Recently, the Ripple Network received a major regulatory green light from the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA), allowing the company to offer cryptocurrency payments and services using XRP in the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC). This development adds to the sense that Ripple is fast becoming a worldwide financial player. Dubai has emerged as a worldwide nexus of blockchain innovation and in mid-2020 established a favorable regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. Those moves align with the emirate’s strategy of nurturing the digital economy. By then, Dubai had well established itself as a global hub for many kinds of fintech, and Ripple was in discussions with the Dubai International Financial Centre, or DIFC. Meanwhile, Ripple was trying to secure a combination of necessary licenses and approvals from key financial regulators to refurbish its expansion in that part of the world. This approval also means increasing acceptance of cryptocurrencies into the traditional financial system. As Ripple establishes its presence in the Middle East, it can help speed along the adoption of XRP and similar digital assets into public and private sector uses across the region. XRP’s Growing Popularity: New Milestones and Record Highs XRP is wowing the market. The total number of XRP addresses just hit an all-time high of 6.87 million. That suggests ever-growing interest in and adoption of the cryptocurrency. In turn, that milestone—by no means a guarantee of an imminent price increase—does appear to suggest that the very base of the XRP user community is expanding. This spike in XRP addresses is representative of a larger trend in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, where digital assets are gaining much more traction and becoming much more mainstream. Why is this much more attention being directed to XRP? Well, the reason is that people and businesses from all over the world are using XRP to make payments toward a dazzling array of ‘use cases.’ In response to this much greater use of the XRP Ledger, demand for the digital asset itself grows and grows. The SEC recognizes XRP as a strategic asset. It has approved XRP for use in U.S. government programs. Ripple’s expansion into Dubai is, in part, a move to gain a foothold in the Asia-Pacific market. With these developments, XRP is becoming an increasingly integral part of the global financial landscape. The total number of $XRP addresses just hit an all-time high of 6.87 million! pic.twitter.com/clpBtKiPkl — Ali (@ali_charts) March 13, 2025 As we see these developments, it is quite clear that XRP is no longer just another cryptocurrency in the market. We see growing regulatory acceptance, and we see increased adoption. XRP is quickly becoming a cornerstone of the future of digital payments and the global financial system.

At this point, North Korea has become one of the largest BTC holders thanks to the activities of the Lazarus Group, a state-affiliated hacker group. According to Arkham data, Lazarus currently has 13,562 BTC worth $1.14 billion, making them a national piggy bank for cybercrime. This increase in the amount of BTC came after the Lazarus Group carried out a major cyber heist on February 21 by stealing more than $1.4 billion worth of Ethereum (ETH) from Bybit. Much of the money, initially Ethereum, was later converted to Bitcoin, bringing North Korea's assets to 13,562 BTC, worth over $1.14 billion. While North Korea has been quietly accumulating Bitcoin through illegal means, the US is taking a legal approach. President Trump officially launched the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve by signing an Executive Order on March 6. This puts the US as the country with the largest Bitcoin holdings with 198,109 BTC worth $16.71 billion. According to Arkham data, the United States ranks first with 198,109 BTC, followed by the United Kingdom with 61,245 BTC. North Korea ranks third, followed by Bhutan and El Salvador with 10,635 BTC and 6,117 BTC respectively. *This is not investment advice.

The first, Natural Gas (NGS) futures, reflects the kind of innovative trading opportunity that appears to be in ever-increasing demand, while the second, Cardano (ADA) futures, looks set to capture a good deal of attention in the burgeoning crypto trading space. Coinbase’s new futures contracts will live on Monday, March 31, as an crucial milestone for the company in diversifying its portfolio and offering a broader array of investment vehicles to traders. For crypto enthusiasts and institutional investors, Cardano futures are an important addition to the Coinbase offerings, as buying movements in the price of the cryptocurrency seem to have recently intensified. We're excited to announce that Coinbase Derivatives has filed with the CFTC to self-certify Natural Gas (NGS) futures and Cardano ( $ADA ) futures—expanding our offerings in both energy and crypto derivatives markets. We anticipate going live with these products on Monday,… pic.twitter.com/YZGmkb1TvM — Coinbase Institutional (@CoinbaseInsto) March 14, 2025 A Strategic Expansion into Energy and Crypto Derivatives The launch of energy and crypto futures products by Coinbase is a clear signal of the company’s ambition to serve a diverse group of market participants. Its new Natural Gas futures product will give investors a way to bet on the price of natural gas, a key energy commodity that has seen some wild price swings in recent years. This allows both institutions and retail investors to play in this vital market without having to deal with the hassle of owning physical natural gas. Simultaneously, adding Cardano futures to the platform marks a mammoth event in the cryptocurrency derivatives world. Cardano ($ADA), a leading force in the crypto space, has drawn considerable attention, given its unusual and forward-thinking approach to blockchain technology and its almost entirely new ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps) compared with the Ethereum-based ones. At the same time, Coinbase is attempting to grow its institutional trading business by capturing investor attention in the cryptocurrency derivatives space. Moving to offer futures contracts on these assets signals maturity not only in the energy markets but also in the cryptocurrency markets. As cryptocurrencies now gain a more robust, mainstream adoption, many energy traders also look to hedge against precursors that lead to price increases or volatility. Not that energy derivative models need help—energy prices are volatile. So why not give traders even more derivatives to play with? Whale Activity and Bullish Indicators for Cardano In the realm of cryptocurrency, few matters are as closely monitored as the sizable transactions conducted by the infamous “whales”—individuals or entities holding large amounts of a given asset. And over the past 72 hours, Cardano has seen quite the uptick in whale activity, with an estimated 130 million ADA tokens being swept up by large investors. Now, what does this all mean? Well, we can infer a couple of things. For starters, large investors appear to have an increasing level of confidence in the future price action of $ADA. Whales bought around 130 million #Cardano $ADA in the last 72 hours! pic.twitter.com/PTNomFSUdc — Ali (@ali_charts) March 15, 2025 Cardano’s price has notably been moving within a well-defined triangle pattern; this is often thought to be a consolidation phase before a breakout. Technical analysis suggests that once $ADA breaks free from this pattern, it could trigger a 15% price increase, possibly propelling the asset to new highs. This situation has traders and analysts eagerly awaiting the breakout, as it could signal a new phase of growth for the cryptocurrency. Whale activity is on the rise, and so is bullish sentiment. For Cardano and its upcoming futures launch on Coinbase, that means something interesting could happen soon. Why? Because these futures contracts could present a diversion of sorts for Cardano, one with a potentially beneficial effect on the asset’s price in the not-too-distant future. With institutional investors and traders moving into the crypto space, the demand for futures contracts as a means of hedging becomes vital. When it comes to $ADA, the coin with which we are presently working, it is worth noting that futures contracts on Cardano have yet to exist in the marketplace. Thus, Coinbase has made a first in an arena that will indubitably grow in the future. What This Means for Traders and the Market The self-certification by Coinbase of these two new futures products is a big deal for the derivatives market. Natural Gas and Cardano futures now are on offer from an exchange that is fully regulated in the United States. They are a new kind of investment vehicle, combining commodity trading with digital assets. For traders, that equals opportunity—more Diversification, better Risk Management. The cryptocurrency derivatives market is developing swiftly, thanks to the rising demand from big investors for fresh means of getting at digital assets. We’re seeing a proliferation of new products, from Cardano futures to who knows what else, that are not only increasing the sophistication of the crypto market but also allowing for some truly next-level trading strategies and a whole lot more liquidity. As the anticipated launch date of March 31 speeds toward us, all attention is focused on Coinbase as it gets set to roll out these thrilling new products for the public. For both energy and crypto traders, the new NGS and Cardano futures from Coinbase are a development that might just usher in a whole new age of growth, innovation, and opportunity in the derivatives market. Moving towards the official launch, the one sure thing is this: our expansion into energy and crypto derivatives represents our latest effort to provide you with new opportunities to trade in and interact with these dynamic markets. This is particularly true for our $ADA futures contract, not simply because Cardano’s recent momentum in the market places it among the most interesting of trading vehicles at the moment, but also because the sudden uptick in interest we’ve seen through the development of this contract places it among the most likely forthcoming offerings on our platform to be in high demand.

BTC touched resistance at $84,000 on Sunday, making it a key level to cross for chances of a run to the upside and trading at just over $83,300 in Asian afternoon hours Monday.

The crypto market has plateaued since last week's sell-off due to the U.S. tariffs and deteriorating macroeconomic conditions. Concerns over a U.S. recession is growing due to Trump's tariffs, traders say, with the likelihood of choppiness ahead as a correlation with U.S. equities staying intact. Still, some see oncoming volatility in altcoins and memecoins amid a flat market regime. “Trading volume has increased for altcoins after Trump's World Liberty Financial bought MNT and AVAX, the latter of which was also part of an ETF application by VanEck,” Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, said in a Telegram message. “This may be a sign that traders and investors will focus on altcoins in the short term for better gains compared to large-cap coins like Bitcoin or Ethereum.” Traders say the current sell-off could have been caused by an unwinding of ETF and spot-linked traders. “The current belief is that the current sell-off is entirely driven by the massive 'multi-strat' hedge fund strategies that have dominated the macro space,” Augustine Fan, Head of Insights at SignalPlus, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. Multi-strategy (multi-strat) trades involve hedge funds using diverse tactics — like arbitrage, long-short positions, and leverage — to maximize returns across asset classes. In bitcoin’s case, a popular multi-strat approach is the basis trade where funds buy spot BTC(often via ETFs) and short BTC futures to profit from price differences. This locks in low-risk gains when the spread is favorable. When profits from basis trades shrink, due to tighter spreads or market shifts , funds exit positions, selling bitcoin and ETF shares en masse. This liquidation pressure likely amplified the sell-off, especially amid tariff-related volatility in the past week. However, the “buy-the-dip” mentality persists among bulls. “Equity valuations outside of the major large caps are relatively contained vs historical averages, and economic hard data is likely to outperform the rapid deterioration in soft data, so market consensus is that this remains a 'buy the dip' market while we work through the tariff volatility,” Fan added.",Markets,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|ADA|SOL|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-17 07:52:35

This has meant new attention from both traders and long-term investors. Santiment, a firm that tracks cryptocurrency metrics, reports that the number of daily active addresses on the Dogecoin network has surged by an eye-catching 400% to almost 395,000. This impressive increase has led to some conversations about whether Dogecoin is in the process of making a comeback. #Dogecoin $DOGE on fire! On-chain data from @santimentfeed shows that active addresses skyrocketed 400% to nearly 395,000. pic.twitter.com/5WuDKjx64K — Ali (@ali_charts) March 15, 2025 Although the performance of Dogecoin during the last few months has been largely determined by the overall meme coin environment—which has cooled since its summer highs—recent price action and on-chain metrics suggest that the Dogecoin still has plenty of upside potential for investors. Reclaiming Support: Dogecoin’s Recovery and Market Potential Dogecoin has reclaimed the support of its seven-month trendline, an important technical indicator that has many traders watching closely. This could signal a turnaround for the meme currency—if not a full-on pump, then at least a moment of price stabilization after a prolonged descent. Currently, Dogecoin is priced at about $0.061, down roughly 75% from its all-time high of $0.731 that it achieved in the fourth quarter of 2021. What is especially noteworthy is that Dogecoin has recovered its trendline support, even though it is down considerably from its all-time high. This is a strong indication that, despite the turbulence it has faced, the coin is holding a lot of value right where it is at present. For many, this begs the question: Is now a good time to start acquiring $DOGE tokens for a long-term hold? $DOGE has reclaimed its 7-month trendline support. It's down 75% from its Q4 peak and has almost erased Trump's win gain. I think now is the right time to start bidding on DOGE for the long-term. Memecoin hype is dead which makes DOGE look even better from an investment… pic.twitter.com/XQA7iZ1BJD — Cas Abbé (@cas_abbe) March 15, 2025 Some analysts see the subsiding memecoin frenzy as a positive development for Dogecoin. They believe that the end of the speculative rush may allow for stabilization in the value of Dogecoin, giving it more room to grow in a less volatile, more sustainable environment. With much of the hype surrounding memecoins dissipating, they see the future price movements of Dogecoin as being less susceptible to the kind of erratic fluctuations driven by social media trends and celebrity endorsements that have historically made it look, to some investors, like more of a traditional investment. The Role of Memecoins and the Dogecoin Narrative Dogecoin, first created as a joke in 2013, has long been connected to the craze for cryptocurrencies that are aligned with Internet memes. At the peak of the memecoin boom, Dogecoin was inarguably one of the top memecoins, especially because it had the backing of such high-profile figures as Elon Musk, who was frequently mentioning the coin in his tweets. This led to some pretty wild price movements, again inarguably connected to Musk’s involvement, and at one point, when the meme market was absolutely going off, Dogecoin attained an all-time high. Nevertheless, when the speculative craze surrounding meme tokens seemed to be winding down, many of these coins, Dogecoin included, were taking steep falls in value. At the top, $DOGE had not just reached but had been said to have “soared to nearly $0.75,” and not just fell back but “shed most of its gains” when it returned to the bottom. Despite this steep decline, a loyal community still follows Dogecoin. That community turns to the Dogecoin Twitter account for the latest news. And while it’s not quite exclusive, Dogecoin’s community still advocates for its use as a “medium of exchange and store of value.” Can you believe these people? A blessing in disguise might be coming for Dogecoin as the memecoin loss of hype moves ever closer. With the market turning away from tokens that can only hope to be part of the next meme, we might just be moving toward a time when the only coins that get bought are those with signs of actual utility or long-term potential. By those measures, Dogecoin should survive in style. Dogecoin’s Long-Term Investment Prospects Though the meme coin fervor driving Dogecoin to great heights may now be over, this could provide an opportune moment for discerning investors to purchase what might be an undervalued asset. As $DOGE seeks to establish itself within the market, retaking key levels of support and enjoying a not-insignificant increase in activity, the cryptocurrency seems on track to carve out a more stable and sustainable price path going forward. Additionally, Dogecoin remains an asset in the crypto sphere because of its market cap, community, and recognition. It stands apart from many other cryptocurrencies for its widespread acknowledgment and ease of use, despite its seemingly basic functionality. Its loyal community makes it all the more endearing; Dogecoin may not be your typical crypto, but it has so many friends that one can hardly consider it an underdog. Those who believe in Dogecoin’s potential are still out there, as the spike in active addresses seems to show. We’ve seen that in the last few weeks, with a large number of traders and investors seemingly not caring about the memecoin label and instead treating Dogecoin as something that could potentially be a long-term hold. This uptick in interest could be what drives Dogecoin’s price back up, since it seems like a sizable number of people now view the asset as something that could rebound. Is Now the Right Time to Bid on $DOGE? If you are thinking about moving into Dogecoin, the current market conditions present a compelling case. Even though the coin has substantially declined from its Q4 2024–peak, $DOGE’s recent trendline support suggests that the Dogecoin might be stabilizing and have future growth potential as market conditions improve. As the hype around memecoins dissipates, Dogecoin’s fundamentals—an active community, an established presence in the crypto ecosystem, and strong on-chain data—emerge as significant factors in its possible resurgence. Even though the crypto market is still in flux, Dogecoin’s recent performance and on-chain metrics give a pretty positive outlook for the future. If you’re a long-term investor looking to diversify with a familiar asset that has a lot of potential to appreciate, $DOGE might be one of the best bets you can make right now. We don’t know if it will ever reclaim the heights it reached in 2021 or if it will establish some new baseline, but in talking with people who follow it closely, the best seems yet to come.

Stablecoin Data Suggests We’re Still in the Mid-Cycle,https://nulltx.com/are-we-at-the-market-peak-stablecoin-data-suggests-were-still-in-the-mid-cycle/,"With the uncertainty and volatility seen in the cryptocurrency market of late, many investors watch key indicators with bated breath. Those indicators might tell us whether the market has hit its zenith or if it can still climb higher. One clear signal this time around, though, could have saved us a lot of the nail-biting we’ve endured. That signal is the supply of stablecoins. Whatever stablecoins are, their supply curve is a key chart to watch if you’re trying to get a read on the future direction of the cryptocurrency market. In the past, the availability of stablecoins has closely followed the ups and downs of the crypto market. When availability goes up, it usually signifies that investors are being more cautious or are getting ready for some kind of market movement. And when we’re trying to gauge the overall market sentiment, the availability of stablecoins is something to pay attention to. So, as we sit here in 2024, the supply of stablecoins has reached new highs, and this chart gives a glimpse into what might be happening behind the scenes. Stablecoins Surge as a Sign of Market Uncertainty Continued growth this week has brought the total supply of stablecoins to $219 billion. This is emblematic of the surging demand for these relatively stable digital assets in the current crypto environment. Until fairly recently, we had a fairly clear picture of which digital assets served as the foundation of the decentralized finance (DeFi) market. Now, unclear developments regarding the regulatory fate of both stablecoins and the blockchain APIs underpinning these assets have injected a healthy dose of uncertainty across the crypto space. Stablecoins continue to gain ground amid market uncertainty, pushing their combined market cap to around $219 billion this week. Remarkably, they’re now only $10 billion away from Ethereum’s market cap, a strong indicator of rising caution in the market. pic.twitter.com/35O5fbyeLW — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) March 14, 2025 Key buildup componenitn the marke’s liquidity gthat allows investors to quickly transact in the market.’This is enhanced liquidity, and that means an assured pathway to the potential stability we can have in our space…during the occurrences of market upheaval.’ Marc Zeller of blockchain payment provider Aave says that with stablecoin supply continuing to rise in the current market, this means that “investors are hedging their positions and not engaging large-scale risk-taking.” Comparing Stablecoin Supply to Previous Market Cycles The peak supply of stablecoins has tracked closely with the high points of market cycles. A prime example of this was in April 2022, when the supply of stablecoins reached $187 billion. The broader cryptocurrency market was then near its own peak, just before a huge downturn shaved down the prices of all major digital assets and sent them into a bear market that has lasted a couple of years and counting. This close-together timing of the peak in stablecoin supply and the nearly coincident downturn in the prices of a whole bunch of other digital assets really brought home an important point: Stablecoins are supposed to be stable, and in most ways they are, but their relationship with the prices of major digital assets is not nearly as stable. Is the market peak in? Stablecoin data suggests otherwise. Historically, stablecoin supply peaks align with cycle highs. In April 2022, supply hit $187B—just as the bear market started. Now it’s at $219B and still rising, suggesting we’re likely still mid-cycle. pic.twitter.com/938qCmEY9I — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) March 14, 2025 Currently, the stablecoin supply has reached $219 billion. It is still going up, and signs are not pointing toward any slow down. In fact, many analysts feel that the situation is calling into question the common narrative that we are in some kind of market peak. What if we're mid-cycle instead? The increasing stablecoin supply could just suggest investors are remaining on the sidelines and waiting to jump back into the market with the next wave of price action. If that is what is happening, then the rising stablecoin market cap might just suggest that we have more room to run. Moreover, the present offering of stablecoins is a mere $10 billion short of matching Ethereum’s market capitalization, which serves to accentuate the surging prominence of stablecoins in the overall cryptocurrency realm. No longer an afterthought, stablecoins are now a serious player. They have a seriously large market cap, and it is becoming seriously close to the market caps of some of the largest, most day-rated cryptocurrencies on the blockchain. The Significance of Stablecoin Market Cap Near Ethereum’s Defensive assets typically fall into three categories: (1) liquid and high-quality securities, (2) low-risk, below-market-return investments, and (3) cash, the ultimate safe haven that earns little but is far from losing anything. Stablecoins mimic cash because they are, in terms of their structure, calls on the liabilities of the cash-issuing institutions. When we talk about the current situation with cash and stablecoins, we need to understand what cash is in a world in which most money exists only in electronic form. A benchmark for the crypto market’s health has always been set by Ethereum’s market cap. As the second-largest crypto by market cap, its moves resonate throughout the rest of the market. Stablecoins being near this level of market cap speaks to their current market sentiment. Investors seem to be looking for more stable options to put their capital in, and the growth in the stablecoin supply reflects that hesitation. It is particularly important to note that stablecoins have remained robust against the backdrop of a more volatile overall crypto market. While many virtual currencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, have suffered grievous price declines, stablecoins have stayed at or near their pegged value. Presumably, that has afforded both traders and long-term investors a kind of security as they navigate the current crypto landscape. And this behavior is becoming even more evident as uncertainty in the market escalates. Are We Still Mid-Cycle? Given the continued rise in stablecoin supply, we can make a pretty safe bet that the peak of this current market cycle is well ahead of us. The last time we saw such a sharp ascent in supply was in late 2021, just before the market took a nosedive. The correlation between stablecoin supply and the direction of the market is pretty close to 1, which means that in both instances where we have seen new all-time highs in the market, the supply of stablecoins has also been at an all-time high. Furthermore, the fact that stablecoins are now playing a central role in the market could be considered additional evidence that we’re in a consolidation period. This doesn’t scream panic to me as far as price action is concerned, but it could suggest that the market is banking on some kind of forthcoming price-moving event—regulatory clarity, perhaps, or a big institutional buy—that could really get things going again. To sum up, although the market looks to be at a crossroads, the ever-rising stablecoin supply indicates a still-ongoing cycle of uncertainty and caution, not an about-to-peak market. Investors are getting themselves positioned with liquidity for the next inevitability to swing our way. And with the supply of stablecoins now nearly capped at Ethereum’s market cap, the stablecoin trend presently looks like one fairly engaged in a broader cycle of development, with lots more stability to come.

What accounts for this surge? A combination of seemingly inexhaustible market demand, technological development, and the relentless evolution of the crypto trading space. Centralized exchanges still take the lion’s share of the market, but decentralized platforms are making quite a name for themselves, too, with new entrants like Hyperliquid also showing some very impressive growth numbers. With Bitcoin’s ongoing lead in open interest and DEXs now enjoying some very rapid top-line growth of their own, the cloud of the crypto perpetual market is obviously setting some very high precedents for itself over this year. CEX Perpetual Trading: A Dominant Surge In 2024, centralized exchange perpetual volumes have climbed to new peaks, achieving a mind-boggling $58.5 trillion traded on these platforms. This is a huge leap compared to previous years and shows that CEXs are still dominating the crypto trading space. When it comes to the top 10 centralized perpetual exchanges, we saw a serious increase there as well. Those exchanges reached a combined trading volume of $21.2 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2024 alone, which represented a monthly growth rate of 79.6% from the third quarter. Even though this may seem to suggest that the competition is getting stronger, it really just shows that Binance’s most significant rival is itself. This top-level competitor can be thought of as a slightly lower fee structure; a steadily declining number of trading pairs, especially with margin trading; the straightforward perpetual trading platform; and a couple of friends: a section of the website that encourages and instructs people to use limit orders, and a video that makes limit orders seem as easy as using a market order. This year, one of the most important developments in perpetual trading on centralized exchanges (CEXs) was the appearance of Coinbase in the list of top 10 perpetual exchanges. This is the first time that the San Francisco-based exchange has appeared in that category, and it came after an almost fourfold increase in the exchange’s trading volume from October to December 2022. That increase suggests that Coinbase, which is now working with several top-tier market makers, has a better chance of being included in the list of traders’ favorites. DEX Perpetual Trading: A Growing Presence Perpetual trading volume growth was also impressive in 2024, on the decentralized exchange side. While the decentralized exchange (DEX) perpetual market is still smaller than the centralized exchange (CEX) perpetual market, the top 10 decentralized exchanges together tallied $492.8 billion in total trading volume in Q4 2024, per Dune Analytics, which was a 55.9% increase from Q3 2024. State of Crypto Perpetuals Market 2024 Report is NOW LIVE Crypto perpetual trading hit new highs in 2024, with both centralized and decentralized exchanges seeing record-breaking volumes. Here are 3 key highlights you shouldn't miss pic.twitter.com/jL35SWUwgV — CoinGecko (@coingecko) March 14, 2025 Hyperliquid became the clear leader in the DEX perpetual market, taking over 55% of the market share by Q4. They peaked in December, shortly after they did a $HYPE airdrop, which sent trading activity surging. The result—with the look of an effective way to boost engagement—was the platform was clearly successful. And overall, the platform highlights something really interesting about decentralized exchanges: Despite the common perception of crypto being dead these days, they might actually be on to something in our ongoing tealocal news tour for the CEX model. In the meantime, another decentralized platform, JupiterExchange, cemented its position as the second-largest perpetual DEX. Yet, it’s essential to underscore that perpetual exchanges based on Solana still made up only about 15% of the overall DEX volumes. On the upside, these Solana DEXs are showing much more rapid growth than their on-chain peers, which might suggest a change in the Solana decentralized trading landscape. The question is, why? Bitcoin and Open Interest: Continued Dominance Although perpetual trading volumes grew significantly in both centralized and decentralized exchange markets, Bitcoin continued to dominate the perpetual trading landscape. By November 2024, the top central exchanges had accumulated over $100 billion in open interest, and they maintained that number for the rest of the year. Of that amount, around 45% came from Bitcoin, with a little more than 20% from Ethereum, and the decentralized exchange Solana having just 4%. It is not surprising that Bitcoin dominates perpetual trading, given that it is the most recognized and traded cryptocurrency. Its continued leadership in open interest underscores its central role in the crypto markets and the appetition for perpetual contracts tied to the asset. Moreover, Bitcoin’s role in open interest has been reinforced by a series of noteworthy events, including significant price movements and major institutional interest all throughout 2024. The trading volume of Solana’s perpetual contracts shot up at certain times in 2024, among them the following: – March 15, mid-week – June 24, Friday – August 1, Tuesday What correlated with those spikes? Solana’s underpinned assets were part of the conversation in trading circles, especially around those dates most likely because the tokens being discussed were also surging. Looking Ahead: A Thriving Market Perpetual trading in crypto seems to have a bright future ahead. Both centralized exchanges (CEX) and decentralized exchanges (DEX) are experiencing growth. Innovations are aplenty, and the desire for crypto derivatives keeps surging. We remain in an era where Bitcoin (BTC) reigns supreme. At the same time, platforms like Hyperliquid are emerging. They and many other decentralized platforms are building the next wave of trading opportunities in an increasingly diverse markets. Moving forward into 2024, decentralized exchanges will have a chance to prove their staying power against centralized ones. An ever-growing number of retail and institutional traders appear to be gravitating toward decentralized finance (DeFi). Where might the perpetual volume balance between CEX and DEX be headed? Currently, the crypto perpetual market is booming, and traders are keenly observing the ongoing evolution of both centralized exchange (CEX) and decentralized exchange (DEX) platforms. Enhanced innovation and heightened adoption are setting the stage for 2024 to be a year of substantial evolution for perpetual contracts within the crypto ecosystem.

Here’s what to do next,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/victim-of-a-crypto-scam-heres-what-to-do-next?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"Beware of various forms of cryptocurrency scams Cryptocurrency scams can manifest in various forms, often preying on the lack of regulation and the complexity of blockchain transactions. You must be aware of common tactics used in cryptocurrency scams. These include: Phishing scams: Attackers send fraudulent emails or messages that mimic legitimate cryptocurrency platforms . Victims may be tricked into providing sensitive information such as private keys or login credentials. Ponzi schemes: Promises of high returns with little to no risk lure investors into schemes that eventually collapse , leaving many with significant losses. Fake ICOs: Fraudulent projects present a compelling investment opportunity, only to disappear after collecting funds. Rug pulls: In decentralized finance (DeFi) , developers of a project could suddenly withdraw all funds from a liquidity pool, leaving investors with worthless tokens. This malicious act is called a rug pull , and it typically occurs after a project has gained enough momentum and unsuspecting investors have bought into it. Social media impersonations: Cybercriminals impersonate reputable influencers or customer support accounts . They use social media to solicit investments or send links that compromise security. Always cross-check identities through official channels. AI-powered scams: AI-powered scams in the crypto space involve advanced tools like phishing bots, deepfakes and exploit bots, which can automatically create convincing fake messages or manipulate platforms to steal funds. These scams are increasingly sophisticated, making it harder for users to spot fraudulent activities and putting digital assets at greater risk. Immediate steps: What to do after a crypto scam If you suspect you have fallen victim to a crypto scam, taking prompt action is crucial. Here’s a step-by-step guide on what to do after a crypto scam: 1. Secure your accounts: Change passwords and enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on your cryptocurrency accounts. Transfer the remaining funds to a secure wallet to minimize further risk. 2. Document the incident: Keep records of all communications, transaction IDs and any other relevant details. This documentation will be essential for recovery efforts and legal action against crypto scams, if possible. 3. Report the scam: Contact local law enforcement and financial regulatory bodies. Many countries have dedicated cybercrime units that can investigate such incidents. File a complaint with consumer protection agencies and report the scam on platforms like the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the UK or the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), a division of the FBI that handles internet-related crimes in the US. You can also report cryptocurrency fraud to Action Fraud in the UK, which will then escalate the case to the National Crime Agency (NCA), which is responsible for investigating major cybercrimes and financial fraud. 4. Seek professional guidance: Consult legal experts specializing in digital assets for legal action regarding crypto scams. They can help navigate the complex legal landscape and potentially assist in recovering lost funds. Engage cybersecurity professionals who can provide crypto fraud help and advice on strengthening your digital security. 5. Monitor and track transactions: Utilize blockchain explorers to trace the movement of your stolen assets. Although cryptocurrencies are designed for transparency, identifying the destination of funds can be challenging without professional assistance. Consider reaching out to companies specializing in blockchain analytics for a detailed investigation. Did you know? Argentine President Javier Milei’s X post endorsing the LIBRA token briefly sent its market cap soaring to $4 billion — only for him to delete it hours later, triggering a crash that wiped out millions in investor funds. How to report a cryptocurrency scam in the US Reporting crypto scams in the US can be challenging because responsibility is spread across multiple agencies at the federal, state and local levels. Before reporting any scam, keep all transaction records, screenshots, emails and any other communications related to the fraud. Determine if it was a phishing attack, fake investment or another form of fraud. This helps in categorizing the complaint accurately. The next steps in reporting the scam are as follows: Federal reporting FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3): This is one of the primary platforms for reporting online financial crimes, including those involving cryptocurrencies. Although many victims report scams through IC3, feedback is often minimal, underscoring the need for a more responsive system. Additional Federal Agencies: Depending on the nature of the scam, you might also consider contacting regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) if the fraud involves investment scams. State and local authorities Local law enforcement: File a report with your local police or cybercrime unit. They can sometimes offer immediate assistance or direct you to specialized resources. State regulators: Some states have dedicated offices for financial protection. For example, in California, authorities like the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) have been actively addressing emerging crypto scams , from fake mining schemes to fraudulent investment groups. Given the fragmented crypto crime reporting system in the US, industry leaders have called for a streamlined, centralized reporting system that not only consolidates data from various agencies but also offers victims a way to track the status of their complaints. While this system is not yet in place, being aware of this need can help you set realistic expectations and encourage further advocacy. Engage with specialized support Legal consultation: Many crypto scams are orchestrated from overseas, making cross-border cooperation essential. A lawyer specialized in cryptocurrency or cybercrime in your jurisdiction could help you navigate the legal system and work with the appropriate agencies. Blockchain analysis firms: Some companies offer forensic services to trace the movement of funds on the blockchain. However, ensure you thoroughly research these firms to avoid further scams. Is it possible to recover crypto lost in scams? It’s one of the toughest questions for anyone scammed in the crypto space: Can I get my lost crypto back? Unfortunately, the short answer is that recovery can be incredibly difficult, but it’s not impossible. Crypto transactions, by nature, are irreversible . Once you send crypto to a scammer’s wallet, no central authority like a bank can reverse the transaction. However, there are still a few steps you can take to attempt recovery and minimize future risks. First, report the scam by contacting local authorities, such as Action Fraud in the UK or the FBI’s IC3 in the US. While they may not be able to recover your funds directly, reporting the incident creates a record of the scam, which could help in more extensive investigations or lead to action against the scammers in the future. Crypto exchanges and wallet providers may also be able to assist if the scam involves funds sent to or received by a platform they control. Contact their support team immediately. Although the likelihood of recovery from an exchange is slim, some platforms may freeze accounts or funds related to suspicious activities. Use blockchain forensics services that specialize in tracing the flow of stolen cryptocurrency on the blockchain. They might help you track where your funds went, and sometimes, this information can be handed over to law enforcement to assist with investigations. However, if your funds were sent to a private wallet or mixed through services designed to obscure transactions, recovery becomes significantly more challenging. While it may not always feel like there’s hope, acting quickly and understanding the complexities of crypto recovery can make a difference. Remember, the best recovery tactic is prevention; staying informed is your first defense. Did you know? Elliptic, a blockchain analytics firm, traced funds stolen in the record-breaking $1.5 billion Bybit hack to the North Korean Lazarus Group, which laundered the assets through exchanges like eXch. Preventative measures: Avoiding cryptocurrency scams Preventing future scams is as critical as recovering from one. Avoiding cryptocurrency scams is all about staying informed and cautious. Implement the following measures to reduce your risk: Do your homework: Before investing in any project or platform, take the time to research. Look into the team behind it, read the white paper and check out reviews from reputable sources. If you can’t find clear, verifiable information or something feels off, trust your instincts and steer clear. Stay updated on scam tactics: The tactics used by scammers are constantly evolving. Familiarize yourself with common scams like phishing, AI-powered or impersonation scams. Following crypto news and joining reputable online communities can keep you informed about the latest warning signs. Question “too-good-to-be-true” offers: If someone promises sky-high returns with little risk, it’s likely a red flag . In crypto, as in any investment, high rewards usually come with high risks. A legitimate opportunity won’t pressure you with unrealistic promises. Verify websites and emails: Scammers often create lookalike websites and send fake emails that mimic trusted services. Always double-check URLs and email addresses, and if something doesn’t match the official website or seems unusual, avoid clicking on any links. Secure your digital assets: Treat your crypto wallets like a personal safe. Use hardware wallets for long-term storage, enable 2FA on all accounts and never share your private keys or recovery phrases. Think of your private keys as the keys to your house — keep them secure and private. Take your time: Scammers love to create urgency with “limited-time offers” or “exclusive deals.” If you’re being rushed into a decision, pause and do your research. Legitimate opportunities will still be available after you’ve had time to verify the details. Diversify your investments: Never put all your money into one asset or project. Diversification helps manage risk and protects you if one investment turns out to be less secure than expected. Seek trusted opinions: If you’re unsure about an investment or an offer, ask for advice from knowledgeable friends or community members. Trusted crypto communities and forums can be great for getting second opinions — but always be cautious and cross-check the information. By staying vigilant, questioning deals that seem too good to be true and taking simple security measures, you can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to crypto scams. It’s all about being cautious and making informed decisions.

Experts Predict Explosive Growth By 2035,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-10-million-explosive-growth-by-2035/,"In a new publication titled The Mustard Seed, Joe Burnett—Director of Market Research at Unchained—outlines a thesis that envisions Bitcoin reaching $10 million per coin by 2035. This inaugural quarterly letter takes the long view, focusing on “time arbitrage” as it surveys where Bitcoin, technology, and human civilization could stand a decade from now. Burnett’s argument revolves around two principal transformations that, he contends, are setting the stage for an unprecedented migration of global capital into Bitcoin: (1) the “Great Flow of Capital” into an asset with absolute scarcity, and (2) the “Acceleration of Deflationary Technology” as AI and robotics reshape entire industries. A Long-Term Perspective On Bitcoin Most economic commentary zooms in on the next earnings report or the immediate price volatility. In contrast, The Mustard Seed announces its mission clearly: “Unlike most financial commentary that fixates on the next quarter or next year, this letter takes the long view—identifying profound shifts before they become consensus.” At the core of Burnett’s outlook is the observation that the global financial system—comprising roughly $900 trillion in total assets—faces ongoing risks of “dilution or devaluation.” Bonds, currencies, equities, gold, and real estate each have expansionary or inflationary components that erode their store-of-value function: Gold ($20 trillion): Mined at approximately 2% annually, increasing supply and slowly diluting its scarcity. Real Estate ($300 trillion): Expands at around 2.4% per year due to new development. Equities ($110 trillion): Company profits are constantly eroded by competition and market saturation, contributing to devaluation risk. Fixed Income & Fiat ($230 trillion): Structurally subject to inflation, which reduces purchasing power over time. Burnett describes this phenomenon as capital “searching for a lower potential energy state,” likening the process to water cascading down a waterfall. In his view, all pre-Bitcoin asset classes were effectively “open bounties” for dilution or devaluation. Wealth managers could distribute capital among real estate, bonds, gold, or stocks, but each category carried a mechanism by which its real value could erode. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Peak In? This Data Suggests Otherwise, Analytics Firm Says Enter Bitcoin, with its 21-million-coin hard cap. Burnett sees this digital asset as the first monetary instrument incapable of being diluted or devalued from within. Supply is fixed; demand, if it grows, can directly translate into price appreciation. He cites Michael Saylor’s “waterfall analogy”: “Capital naturally seeks the lowest potential energy state—just as water flows downhill. Before bitcoin, wealth had no true escape from dilution or devaluation. Wealth stored in every asset class acted as a market bounty, incentivizing dilution or devaluation.” As soon as Bitcoin became widely recognized, says Burnett, the game changed for capital allocation. Much like discovering an untapped reservoir far below existing water basins, the global wealth supply found a new outlet—one that cannot be augmented or diluted. To illustrate Bitcoin’s unique supply dynamics, The Mustard Seed draws a parallel with the halving cycle. In 2009, miners received 50 BTC per block—akin to Niagara Falls at full force. As of today, the reward dropped to 3.125 BTC, reminiscent of halving the Falls’ flow repeatedly until it is significantly reduced. In 2065, Bitcoin’s newly minted supply will be negligible compared to its total volume, mirroring a waterfall reduced to a trickle. Though Burnett concedes that attempts to quantify Bitcoin’s global adoption rely on uncertain assumptions, he references two models: the Power Law Model which projects $1.8 million per BTC by 2035 and Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin model which suggests $2.1 million per BTC by 2035. He counters that these projections might be “too conservative” because they often assume diminishing returns. In a world of accelerating technological adoption—and a growing realization of Bitcoin’s properties—price targets could overshoot these models significantly. The Acceleration Of Deflationary Technology A second major catalyst for Bitcoin’s upside potential, per The Mustard Seed, is the deflationary wave brought on by AI, automation, and robotics. These innovations rapidly increase productivity, lower costs, and make goods and services more abundant. By 2035, Burnett believes global costs in several key sectors could undergo dramatic reductions. Adidas’ “Speedfactories” cut sneaker production from months to days. The scaling of 3D printing and AI-driven assembly lines could slash manufacturing costs by 10x. 3D-printed homes already go up 50x faster at far lower costs. Advanced supply-chain automation, combined with AI logistics, could make quality housing 10x cheaper. Autonomous ride-hailing can potentially reduce fares by 90% by removing labor costs and improving efficiency. Burnett underscores that, under a fiat system, natural deflation is often “artificially suppressed.” Monetary policies—like persistent inflation and stimulus—inflate prices, masking technology’s real impact on lowering costs. Bitcoin, on the other hand, would let deflation “run its course,” increasing purchasing power for holders as goods become more affordable. In his words: “A person holding 0.1 BTC today (~$10,000) could see its purchasing power increase 100x or more by 2035 as goods and services become exponentially cheaper.” To illustrate how supply growth erodes a store of value over time, Burnett revisits gold’s performance since 1970. Gold’s nominal price from $36 per ounce to roughly $2,900 per ounce in 2025 appears substantial, but that price gain was continuously diluted by the annual 2% increase in gold’s overall supply. Over five decades, the global stock of gold almost tripled. If gold’s supply had been static, its price would have hit $8,618 per ounce by 2025, according to Burnett’s calculations. This supply constraint would have bolstered gold’s scarcity, possibly pushing demand and price even higher than $8,618. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaches 12-Year Support Line Against Gold – Is The Bull Run Over? Bitcoin, by contrast, incorporates precisely the fixed supply condition that gold never had. Any new demand will not spur additional coin issuance and thus should drive the price upward more directly. Burnett’s forecast for a $10 million Bitcoin by 2035 would imply a total market cap of $200 trillion. While that figure sounds colossal, he points out that it represents only about 11% of global wealth—assuming global wealth continues to expand at a ~7% annual rate. From this vantage point, allocating around 11% of the world’s assets into what The Mustard Seed calls “the best long-term store of value asset” might not be far-fetched. “Every past store of value has perpetually expanded in supply to meet demand. Bitcoin is the first that cannot.” A key piece of the puzzle is the security budget for Bitcoin: miner revenue. By 2035, Bitcoin’s block subsidy will be down to 0.78125 BTC per block. At $10 million per coin, miners could earn $411 billion in aggregate revenue each year. Since miners sell the Bitcoin they earn to cover costs, the market would have to absorb $411 billion of newly mined BTC annually. Burnett draws a parallel with the global wine market, which was valued at $385 billion in 2023 and is projected to reach $528 billion by 2030. If a “mundane” sector like wine can sustain that level of consumer demand, an industry securing the world’s leading digital store of value reaching similar scale, he argues, is well within reason. Despite public perception that Bitcoin is becoming mainstream, Burnett highlights an underreported metric: “The number of people worldwide with $100,000 or more in bitcoin is only 400,000… that’s 0.005% of the global population—just 5 in 100,000 people.” Meanwhile, studies might show around 39% of Americans have some level of “direct or indirect” Bitcoin exposure, but this figure includes any fractional ownership—such as holding shares of Bitcoin-related equities or ETFs through mutual funds and pension plans. Real, substantial adoption remains niche. “If Bitcoin is the best long-term savings technology, we would expect anyone with substantial savings to hold a substantial amount of bitcoin. Yet today, virtually no one does.” Burnett emphasizes that the road to $10 million does not require Bitcoin to supplant all money worldwide—only to “absorb a meaningful percentage of global wealth.” The strategy for forward-looking investors, he contends, is simple but non-trivial: ignore short-term noise, focus on the multi-year horizon, and act before global awareness of Bitcoin’s properties becomes universal. “Those who can see past the short-term volatility and focus on the bigger picture will recognize bitcoin as the most asymmetric and overlooked bet in global markets.” In other words, it is about “front-running the capital migration” while Bitcoin’s user base is still comparatively minuscule and the vast majority of traditional wealth remains in legacy assets. At press time, BTC traded at $83,388.

A recent post on X (formerly Twitter) by Binance CEO, Changpeng Zhao, better known as CZ, is a prime example of this. Following his post, the price of $MUBARAK rocketed up by a jaw-dropping 400%. The meme token on the BNB Chain saw its market capitalization leap from a paltry number to a stunning $40 million in a few hours, with trading volume going through the roof and quite a few folks looking askance at this seemingly obvious attempt at market manipulation. $mubarak Hits $40M Market Cap, Leads BNB Chain in Trading Volume! According to @angrybotX , $mubarak has surged to a $40M market cap, with a 24H trading volume of $38M, solidifying its position as the top-traded token on BNB Chain! #BNBchain #mubarak https://t.co/5kIui5sOWA pic.twitter.com/NyDAzmFkWp — Followin (@followin_io) March 15, 2025 The Spark That Ignited $MUBARAK’s Meteoric Rise It all began when CZ posted a seemingly innocuous tweet on Binance Square: “Going to meet a friend this weekend,” along with a meme that referenced $MUBARAK. While this tweet appeared to bear no ill intentions and to be lighthearted, it was enough to send the crypto community itself into shock and uproar. Within mere hours of the posting, the price of $MUBARAK began a rapid ascent, which, in the nearly 14 years of my being in this space, I have not seen the likes of. By the end of the first day, the price of $MUBARAK had blasted off, rising some 400%. This is an impressive feat in any world, but especially in the highly speculative domain of cryptocurrencies. CZ's Post Sends $MUBARAK Soaring 400% Binance founder @cz_binance posted “Going to meet a friend this weekend” along with a #Mubarak meme on Binance Square. Following the post, $Mubarak on BNB Chain skyrocketed 400%, reaching a $22M market cap! #mubarak #CZ pic.twitter.com/vFC7dKeM8c — Followin (@followin_io) March 15, 2025 For many, the post appeared to be an offhand comment, but in the fast-paced world of crypto, even the smallest hint from an influential figure such as CZ can set off a huge market reaction. The meme seemed to strike a chord with followers, who took it as a kind of signal or endorsement of the obscure token, and this was seen to lead to a mad dash of buying activity. As a result, or maybe in sync with the buy orders, $MUBARAK’s market capitalization leaped to what by any measure reads as a staggering $22 million, before continuing to reach an even more impressive $40 million. What this surge really makes notable is the fact that it was driven almost wholly by social media and community sentiment. As the token went meme mode, more traders piled into the thing, pushing $MUBARAK to the forefront of the BNB Chain ecosystem. You can see this clearly in the trading volume. As of this writing, not only is the price of $MUBARAK soaring, but so too is trading volume. And guess what: $MUBARAK is leading the pack in terms of actual activity on the BNB Chain. $MUBARAK Becomes a Market Leader As stated by @angrybotX, a trustworthy provider of crypto market analysis, $MUBARAK’s stunning ascent has taken it to a $40 million market capitalization, with a truly phenomenal 24-hour trading volume of $38 million. This has rightly made the token a focal point for traders, as it is now the top-traded asset on the BNB Chain. The market’s continued reaction to the rapid increase in the value of $MUBARAK has seen the token’s user base and trading community swell. This sudden growth has stoked the fires of various social media platforms, where crypto enthusiasts are engaging in speculation about whether this is a momentary blip or a sign of something more meaningful. It’s not unprecedented for a cryptocurrency to be inspired by a meme and experience a rally, but the rapidity and force of the price movement have left many people astonished. $MUBARAK’s rise to prominence also indicates the sway that influential figures like CZ have in the crypto space. CZ’s post has been much talked about, with a lot of people in the crypto community taking it as a not-so-subtle endorsement (or at least joke) that people could latch onto. This connects to the really deep association between social media, online culture, and the cryptocurrency market, where even a meme or a casual mention from a high-profile figure can lead to real-world market effects. The Role of Memes in Crypto Culture Meme culture has become a driver for much of the cryptocurrency world. Million-dollar virtual currencies are sometimes created from memes such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, which often gain traction through the engagement of communities of investors. But as a new study from Cision found, cryptocurrencies that are based on memes are more likely to be scams than serious projects. For numerous investors, the attraction of meme coins lies in their potential for massive returns, driven by the market momentum and viral trends they create. Still, this kind of trading is not without its dangers. The market for tokens built on memes is a highly speculative one, where, yes, you might make some fast money, but just as likely, you could get burned. With the $MUBARAK meme coin, the question now is whether its price can hold on to the big gains it’s made or whether it, like most memes, will just burn out. Right now, $MUBARAK is definitely in the spotlight, and its price just keeps going up after CZ’s post. The token has everyone trading, investing in, or meme-ing it, and riding the wave of its meteoric rise. Whether this is a flash in the pan or the start of something more robust, you have to give it up for $MUBARAK as it currently occupies a hallowed space in the pantheon of BNB Chain tokens. To sum up, $MUBARAK is on the scene and it’s a force to be reckoned with. Just as Tie-Dye CZ highlighted in his recent meme post, the sheer power that social media—and by extension, influential figures like CZ—wield over the crypto markets is nothing to trifle with. Of course, this is something we’ve seen time and time again in this industry. A meme coin can’t really be a top performer unless the crypto community is actively engaging with it and holding it up as the next big thing—basically unless it’s become a running joke that everyone is in on.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) price returning to $100,000 could prompt “short-term consolidation,” analysts warn, though the long-term outlook for the cryptocurrency remains positive. While key psychological levels often lead to profit-taking, analysts point to gold’s rise to new all-time highs as a sign of growing momentum for alternative assets. Analysts at Matrixport noted that the shift in sentiment that began in the summer of 2023, when gold broke above $2,000, has boosted the outlook for Bitcoin since it has increasingly been seen as a form of “digital gold,” a narrative popularized by investment giant firm BlackRock . “Regardless of the prevailing narrative, both gold and Bitcoin are poised to grow in importance as alternative assets gain momentum. While key psychological levels-such as gold at $3,000 or Bitcoin at $100,000-could trigger short-term consolidation, the broader uptrend likely remains intact.” Markus Thielen, independent analyst You might also like: Bank of Korea: Bitcoin doesn’t meet foreign reserve standards As crypto.news explained earlier, Bitcoin now faces two potential risks and two opportunities.

The mid-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $794 million and a 24-hour average trading volume of around $239 million, pumped more than 16 percent in the last 24 hours to trade around $2.16 on Monday, March 17, during the mid-European session. Top Reasons Why CAKE Price Surged Today The notable rise of CAKE price in the past 24 hours is majorly attributed to the rising on-chain activity of the PancakeSwap DEX. In the past 24 hours, PancakeSwap was the leading DEX by the overall volume traded of about $1.24 billion. In comparison, Solana’s Raydium recorded a 24-hour volume of about $418 million while Ethereum’s Uniswap (UNI) recorded a net daily volume of about $1 billion. As Coinpedia mentioned, the notable demand for the Mubarak (MUBARAK) memecoin has helped increase the overall on-chain activity on the PancakeSwap DEX. Moreover, MUBARAK price has surged over 2000 percent in the past four days to trade at about $0.13 at the time of this writing. According to market data from Defillama, PancakeSwap DEX has seen its total value locked (TVL) surge to about $1.62 billion. With over $160 million in staked CAKE, PancakeSwap has grown to a reputable DeFi platform. PancakeSwap Price Forecast From a technical analysis standpoint, CAKE price has been forming a macro market reversal pattern in the past year. The reversal pattern is characterized by a potential inverted head and shoulders (H&S) formation, coupled with a bullish divergence of the weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI). The altcoin has established a robust support level above $1.55, which has been confirmed after a consistent close above in the past two weeks. In case of bullish sentiment ahead, CAKE’s price is aiming for $5 in the near term, which coincides with the 1.618 daily Fibonacci Extension.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,CAKE|TRADING|ALTCOIN|MARKET|UNI,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-17 08:04:29
41797954,https://nulltx.com/?p=147174,1742198792,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Smart Money Movements in Memecoin Market: March 14, 2025 Shows More Outflows Than Inflows",https://nulltx.com/smart-money-movements-in-memecoin-market-march-14-2025-shows-more-outflows-than-inflows/,"The very unstable world of cryptocurrencies—especially the memecoin market—gives us such an insight into where things are heading. On March 14, 2025, that direction was clear: we were heading away from memecoins . For the day, there was a net outflow across the memecoin market of about $10,000, which was not huge but was certainly significant for a market that had been gith bushed directionally. There was a slight issue in that certain tokens wit; a net outflow was mitigated by inflows into those specific tokens. The Day’s Market Movements: A Closer Look Data from March 14 shows overall market activity was relatively calm, with a total volume of $2.89 million. Despite this moderate volume, the key takeaway was the slight imbalance in inflows and outflows. Total inflows were $1.44 million, while total outflows were $1.45 million. So we were very, very slightly net negative on that front. The net drop in volume wasn’t even enough to make it into the next paragraph — a drop of $10,000, to be precise. Although the small net loss would not appear to suggest that market conditions are dire, it does demand a moment of caution. A market that sees more outflows than inflows, even by a small margin, must indicate some loss of confidence in certain tokens or the overall market. But no market is in turmoil when it sees a reasonably orderly expression of the kind previously mentioned—rather, this might just be a sign that some investors are reallocating their portfolios and moving down the risk curve. Key Inflows: Investors Find Value in Select Tokens There were some tokens that managed to garner inflows despite the overall trend of outflows. This shows that certain memecoins are managing to capture attention from investors. The tokens that saw the most positive inflow were $WBTC, $JTO, and $GIGA. – $WBTC (Wrapped Bitcoin) recorded a strong inflow of $82K, demonstrating that there are indeed some investors who seem to be interested in gaining exposure to the larger Bitcoin ecosystem. However, these investors are choosing to enter the ecosystem through a “wrapped” form that allows them to use Bitcoin on the Ethereum network or other smart contract blockchains. For many traders, the workarounds that wrapped tokens provide make them increasingly popular options, as they allow the trader to retain the asset they really want exposure to while also participating in a conveniently accessible trading environment. One of the largest inflows was experienced by $JTO, which had $170K added to its coffers. This might reflect the growing interest in the token’s unique positioning in the memecoin space. The relative newcomer status of $JTO could be playing a role, too, as traders look for under-the-radar tokens with the potential for significant upside. – The inflows for $GIGA and $GFM were $53K and $43K, respectively. These figures may suggest that there is still some optimism around memecoins with innovative features or strong community backing. While I don’t think the smaller inflows to these tokens really indicate m ass adoption, I do think they show that some investors still see value in the niche assets that comprise the memecoin market. – $BONK, a well-known name in the memecoin sphere, received an inflow of $90K. Although many memecoins are surrounded by intense volatility, $BONK’s presence in the memecoin space seems as solid as ever, allowing it to allure that $90K inflow. One could look to other memecoins for signs of how volatile they can get, but it seems $BONK is slightly more stable than many potential counterparts. The Outflows: Investors Abandon Riskier Tokens Even though a few tokens managed to draw in some capital, there were others that experienced substantial outflows. This illustrates investor caution—or possibly even some disenchantment—with particular memecoins. Among those memecoins suffering the greatest outflows were: – $POPCAT, with a sharp outflow of $149K. It is now the meme-driven viral popularity of $POPCAT that seems like it is slowly fading away. The traders who have invested in $POPCAT seem to have switched their strategies; they appear to be selling $POPCAT off. A fire sale has been announced. $POPCAT looks like it was a one-hit wonder. Trading in $POPCAT seems to have dropped off dramatically. – $PIPPIN, another memecoin with fluctuating popularity, experienced $67K in outflows. Investors may have pulled their funds from $PIPPIN because they were concerned about its long-term sustainability or because they were simply shifting their market preferences. – A significant outflow of $127K from $FWOG took place. The outflow from this token could be part of a larger shift where investors are becoming more risk-averse regarding tokens that don’t appear to have strong fundamentals or market leadership. – $FAT, which is down $108K, also saw a notable exodus of funds. As with other tokens that are seeing outflows, this could suggest a risk-averse movement among investors, moving out of certain meme-driven projects and into what they perceive to be more stable or newer opportunities. The less conventional token #FARTCOIN experienced outflows of $148K. Its meme-based nature may have attracted many traders, but the lack of any long-term, serious value likely had investors bailing on this humorously named cryptocurrency. Recap: Smart money on chain activities in the memecoin market for 14/03/25 Yesterday, there was more outflow than inflow Inflow: $1.44M Outflow: $1.45M Volume: $2.89M Net Volume: -$10k There was inflow into: $WBTC ($82K) $JTO ($170K) $GIGA ($53K) $GFM ($43K) $BONK ($90K)… pic.twitter.com/0lCpQkVo57 — Stalkchain (@StalkHQ) March 15, 2025 Investor Sentiment and Market Outlook The net outflow of $10,000 on March 14, 2025, while relatively small, reflects a broader sentiment of caution. Investors appear to be pulling back from riskier positions, favoring more stable assets, at least for the time being. This newfound caution of investors may spring from several wells: recent market turbulence, a shift in sentiment among traders, or simply the natural ebb and flow of investor interest in high-risk assets like memecoins. Inflow into tokens such as $WBTC, $JTO, and $BONK shows that some parts of the memecoin market still attract investment. But outflows from tokens like $POPCAT and $PIPPIN raise questions about the future of certain memecoins, suggesting that the speculative bubble surrounding them may be deflating. The memecoin market could be at a consolidation stage, now only the most resilient and well-supported memecoins amass considerable interest among traders and investors. Outlook: Traders and investors scanning the horizon for the next big, meme-driven rally should probably keep their heads down and work under a caution flag for now. On the whole, memecoin investors might have viewed March 14, 2025, with some disappointment, as the memecoin market was among the crypto sectors that experienced net outflows on that day. Yet there were still pockets of interest and even some cheerfulness among certain memecoins. Tokens like $WBTC and $JTO, for instance, exhibited noticeable growth on March 14, suggesting that not all was lost for the memecoin market that day.

SOL/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/ TradingView The top reasons driving the SOL prices lower today include: Decreasing investor interest in SOL’s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Decreasing open interest and negative funding rates. Technicals suggest a possible further drop in SOL price. Solana TVL hits four-month lows SOL’s price drop today is preceded by a drop in the total value locked (TVL) in its DeFi applications, as per data from DefiLlama. Key points: Solana’s TVL has been in a downtrend since mid-January. This metric fell by 45.5% from $12.1 billion on Jan. 19 to $6.63 billion on March 11. The TVL now stands at $7 billion on March 17, 41% below the Jan. 19 peak. Solana total value locked. Source: DefiLlama This drop in TVL occurred in tandem with the decrease in SOL’s price, which is down 56% over the same period. Several layer-2 protocols, such as Jito and Raydium, have posted 30% and 32% drops in TVL over the last 30 days. The declining TVL reflects traders’ waning interest and could be a sign that Solana struggles to attract new users despite its lower traction costs. Solana’s price slump is also supported by a decline in onchain activity within the Solana ecosystem , according to the data provided by Dune dashboard Pump.fun . What to know: A sharp drop in the number of network transactions preceded SOL’s price drop on March 17. The amount of daily transactions on the Solana blockchain has dropped from an all-time high of 71,738 on Jan. 23 to 24.505 on March 17, as shown in the chart below. Solana’s deployed transactions performance chart. Source: Pump.Fun This indicates decreasing network activity, resulting in lower revenues from fees. This negatively affects SOL’s price, partially explaining the ongoing correction. Solana funding rates remain negative Solana's open interest (OI) is decreasing, and its funding rates are negative, which provides insight into why SOL’s price is struggling. Key points: Solana’s OI in the futures market has dripped from its local peak of $8.57 billion on Jan. 17 to $4.03 billion as of March 17. OI measures the total number of outstanding futures contracts, and a decrease suggests more traders are exiting positions. SOL futures open interest.

Related: Solana’s 5th birthday: From pandemic origins to US crypto stockpile SOL price could drop another 35% SOL trades 56% below its all-time high of around $294, established on Jan. 19, and chart technicals suggest that there’s more room for the downside over the next few weeks. Key levels to watch: The altcoin has been trading above the $120 level, but the bulls have failed to push the price above $135. If the price slides below $120, the SOL/USDT pair could drop to the $110 range low (established on Aug. 5, 2025). This is a critical support to watch out for because a break and close below it may start a downward move to $100 and then to $80. Such a move would represent a 35% drop from the current price.

A break and close above the $140 psychological level will suggest that the selling pressure is reducing. The pair could rally to the 50-day simple moving average at $171, where the bears are expected to mount a strong defense. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Finally, there is a burgeoning area of interest in truly decentralized finance platforms, which are primitive to what many call today an “innovative financial system.” These three storylines are driving the strategies of large investors, whose activity is increasingly important to the cryptocurrency markets. Kanye West and Meme Coins: $YZY Leads the Way In recent days, one of the standout trends seems to be the surge of interest in Kanye West’s involvement in the crypto space, particularly in meme coins. Known for his pop culture influence, Kanye West’s endorsement, whether intentional or not, has driven a ton of eyeballs toward the tokens allegedly linked to him. One such token is $YZY. Over the past 24 hours, four smart money wallets have scooped up over $22,000 of $YZY. The market cap of the token is currently $22.49 million. No one really knows (or cares) how a meme coin tied to Kanye West came to be, but it’s safe to say it has something to do with the rapper’s colossal presence on social media and the sheer association of his name with buzzworthy tokens. AI and Agentic Frameworks: $MAIAR Sparks Development Interest A different accumulation trend has developed around AI projects. In contrast to general layer 1 and layer 2 projects, which we saw recently accumulating, there has been an uptick in the last few days in smart money moving into AI-powered projects. This trend has shifted significantly toward projects that we classify as agentic frameworks—systems that enable machines or algorithms to perform complex tasks without human oversight. A prime example of such a project is MAIAR ($MAIAR), which has recently announced Phase 3 of its development. Over the last 24 hours, two smart money wallets have accumulated $6,000 worth of $MAIAR, pushing the token’s market cap to $1.7 million. Smart money wallets accumulations in the last 24 hours Main specific narratives accumulated: Kanye West & Meme Coins (9 wallets) AI & Agentic Frameworks (8 wallets) DeFi & Financial Innovations (5 wallets) Top accumulations and reasoning: $YZY (Swasticoin) ->… pic.twitter.com/uE5LRa5BN6 — CoinSense.app (@CoinSense_App) March 15, 2025 DeFi Innovations: $AAVE and $BNKR Garner Smart Money Support Even as AI and meme coins attract much of the limelight, the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector remains a foundational part of the crypto market’s growth. A high-profile project that is drawing ever more interest is $AAVE, the massively popular DeFi lending platform. It’s not just retail investors who are excited about $AAVE these days; smart money, too, is taking notice. In the past 24 hours, one highly regarded crypto wallet accumulated $38,000 in $AAVE, a coin whose market cap now stands at a whopping $2.6 billion. A recent announcement from the $AAVE team about a new economic model and a buyback plan appears to have sparked fresh investor enthusiasm. $BNKR (BankrCoin), in the domain of artificial intelligence and decentralized finance, has thrown out more than its share of ripples. $BNKR’s token is capturing what uninitiated observers might consider its “brain power” — the crypto companion powered by AI, designed to turbocharge DeFi. A smart money wallet just picked up $11,000 worth of $BNKR, which now has a market cap of $22.4 million. The combination of AI and DeFi seems on its surface to be a potent cocktail, proof of which is the $BNKR narrative. Unique and Niche Projects: $GFM and $PVS Catch Investor Interest In addition to the main stories about Kanye West, DeFi, and AI, some more obscure projects are also drawing the interest of smart money wallets and attracting investors’ attention. $GFM (GoFundMeme), a community-driven project with a focus on meme tokens, has racked up some recent interest. One smart money wallet added $14,000 to its holdings of $GFM, which now has a market cap of $16.7 million. The project’s focus on community incentives and the transparency of its fair launch have made it a standout in the crowded market for meme coins. Currently, $PVS is a blip on the radar of most crypto investors, with a relatively small market cap of $3.3 million. Most of its trading volume so far has come from centralized exchange CEX.IO, where $PVS is priced at $0.00397 as of midday September 28. However, that trading volume is dramatically up from where it was this time last week, when the price of $PVS was roughly $0.0016. Over the past 24 hours prior to this writeup, $PVS had a total trading volume of $308,840. Over the same timeframe, its price has climbed from $0.0035 to where $PVS now sits at midday on September 28. Conclusion: Smart Money Navigates Emerging Trends In the previous 24 hours, smart money wallets have been accumulating a different assortment of tokens—a bandwagon effect that seems to underlie the current cryptocurrency trends. The latest additions to the wallets have been meme coins. They also contain tokens tied to AI projects, and some are stashing DeFi-related coins. It appears that the investors who these wallets represent are now banking on the idea that certain narratives (or stories) are going to drive the prices of these tokens higher in the near future. As these sectors keep developing, it’s going to be intriguing to witness their evolution and to discern which kinds of projects will endure. At present, though, investors are evidently putting their bets on meme-driven momentum, groundbreaking AI advancements, and the potential for financial innovation in DeFi. Whether these bets will pan out or be smacked down by the kind of market volatility that everyone in the crypto space has come to know and love remains to be seen.

The exchange decided to suspend the DEX aggregator while it works on upgrades to prevent further issues, following consultations with regulators. OKX Pauses DEX Aggregator for Internal Review and Upgrades OKX confirmed the suspension is for an internal review and upgrade but it did not specify when it would end. Crypto wallet services are still available to the customers, but new wallet creation will be paused in some markets during this time. “We are temporarily pausing our DEX aggregator to address incomplete tagging on blockchain explorers while we also roll out new security features. This is to address the recent coordinated attacks by media along with unsuccessful efforts by Lazarus group to misuse our DeFi services,” it noted. On March 11, Bloomberg reported that EU financial regulators were investigating OKX’s DEX aggregator, OKX Web3, and its wallet services for allegedly laundering funds from the Bybit hack. In response, OKX said that it had been the target of media attacks questioning its integrity. The exchange added that these attacks are happening at a time when they are actively fighting against financial crime. OKX Denies Allegations Bybit’s CEO, Ben Zhou, claimed nearly $100 million of the $1.5 billion stolen in the hack was funneled through OKX’s Web3 service, with some funds now untraceable. However, OKX denied the allegations, calling the report misleading. The exchange explained that, when the Bybit hack occurred, it froze any associated funds from moving to its centralized exchange (CEX) and worked on new hack detection features. OKX Launches Hacker Detection System OKX stated that its goal is to ensure that explorers correctly identify trades processed by the DEX, instead of mistakenly linking them to its aggregator. The exchange has introduced a “hacker address detection system” for its DEX aggregator and can track and block hacker addresses in real time on its centralized exchange. OKX CEO Star Xu emphasized that they have implemented several controls, including IP blocking for certain markets and real-time black address detection. OKX also clarified that the OKX Web3 DEX aggregator is not a custodian of customer assets, and its function is to provide access to liquidity across multiple protocols. However it noted that some have deliberately misrepresented its platform.",News|Crypto news|Hack,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-17 08:11:09

Speculation is growing that this investor may have inside information about the US President Donald Trump. Meanwhile, a group of traders is reportedly working together to push BTC price high enough to trigger the liquidation, turning this into a major crypto showdown. Bitcoin Whale Faces Liquidation Woes According to market expert Gordon, a whale has doubled down on a massive Bitcoin short. Initially, the investor placed a 40x leverage bet worth $380 million. However, after adding to the position, their new liquidation price stands at $86,593. “There seems to be a group of whales trying to pump BTC to liquidate him.” Gordon wrote in a post on X . The move suggests coordinated action among traders, a rare but not unheard-of event in the crypto world. Notably, a latest report from CoinGape also showed that BTC might continue its rally amid rising whale activity. Trump Insider Link Fuels Speculation Adding to discussions, the whale is rumored to have insider knowledge about US President Donald Trump. According to an update from Ash Crypto, this investor allegedly placed their short position based on confidential information. Ash Crypto wrote: “Trump insider whale who opened a $380 million bitcoin short with 40x is being hunted publicly on “ X ” by a group of people who are trying to liquidate him at $86,600.” If the speculation holds true, it raises questions about whether political developments could influence Bitcoin’s future price movements. Trump’s stance on cryptocurrency has shifted over time, making any connection between him and the whale’s move a subject of intense debate. Besides, the announcement of the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve in the US has further fueled speculations in the market. Liquidity Providers Enter the Game In a striking development, liquidity provider CBB also weighed in on the unfolding drama. In a recent X post, the account stated: “If you are willing to hunt this dude with size, drop a DM, setting up a team right now and already got good size.” Shortly after, CBB followed up with a cryptic message: “The hunt has begun.” This statement suggests a coordinated effort is now underway to force Bitcoin’s price up and trigger the whale’s liquidation. If successful, it could lead to a sudden price surge and increased market volatility. Bitcoin Price & Performance BTC price today was down around 1% and exchanged hands at $83K, while its one-day volume rocketed 93% to $24 billion. The crypto has touched a 24-hour high and low of $85,051.60 and $82,017.90, respectively. Despite the current loss, the flagship crypto has recorded gains of more than 1% in the last seven days. Meanwhile, amid the gloomy performance, a report showed that BTC price might crash to $20K if the US stock market enters a “BEAR MARKET”, which has further escalated tensions. Having said that, investors are keeping close track of the latest BTC movements, with soaring speculations over potential insider trading in the market.

41798220,https://nulltx.com/?p=147172,1742199186,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Non-Wholecoiners Show Their Paper Hands as Bitcoin Market Trends Shift,https://nulltx.com/non-wholecoiners-show-their-paper-hands-as-bitcoin-market-trends-shift/,"The cryptocurrency world is undergoing change, and a shift is noticeable among non-wholecoiners—those who’ve not quite reached the 1 Bitcoin mark. Entities and individual holders of Bitcoin less than 1 BTC have been offloading it. Meanwhile, it seems that the playing field—the market cap landscape—is becoming less retail and more institutional. This retail-to-institutional evolution isn’t something new, as it’s something we’ve seen before. The enthusiasm seen in late 2020 with the influx of retail investors has now subsided, and Bitcoin remains less of an everyday topic. Despite the recent waning enthusiasm, these larger institutional players are still in acquisition mode, amassing enormous amounts of Bitcoin. A Familiar Pattern Emerges in the Current Cycle The market behaves in a certain way with non-wholecoiners, and it’s a way we’ve seen before. In the last cycle, when Bitcoin was hitting its all-time high of $40,000, we were watching a similar trend where smaller holders were offloading their BTC. At that time, non-wholecoiners (or, as I like to call them, “the not-so-elite club” of Bitcoin holders) sold off not an insignificant amount of Bitcoin (roughly 0.07 million, if you’re counting). Of course, this produced a wave of market activity that the smooth operators in the Bitcoin price discovery mechanism would rather avoid. In the next section, we’ll look at why non-wholecoiners feel compelled to sell when they do. Fast forward to today, and this behavior seems to be repeating itself. As Bitcoin climbs once again, those who own less than 1 BTC are increasingly liquidating their holdings. These smaller holders appear to be responding to Bitcoin’s price surges by either cashing out for profits or becoming more risk-averse. However, it is important to note that this trend does not necessarily signal a decline in overall market confidence. In fact, despite the offloading of Bitcoin by these retail investors, Bitcoin holdings from retail users have actually grown by 37% since 2020. Currently, retail investors collectively hold around 1.75 million BTC, a significant increase from previous years. Non-Wholecoiners show their paper hands As companies and governments continue to accumulate #Bitcoin , non-wholecoiners holding less than 1 $BTC are gradually reducing their holdings, mirroring the trend seen in late 2020. In the previous cycle, when $BTC surged to $40K,… pic.twitter.com/J77Hf4YHYu — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) March 14, 2025 Institutional Accumulation Continues to Drive Market Dynamics Institutional investors and large financial players are still bullish on bitcoin, and they keep adding to their positions. Meanwhile, smaller bitcoin holders are now reducing their exposure. Entities both public and private are coming to see bitcoin as more than just a store of value: they’re increasingly viewing it as an inflation-hedge and a way to navigate uncertain economic waters. The latest manifestation of this bitcoin bull market? According to some analysts, it’s the bitcoin ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) that have been roaring out of the gate. New data emphasize the meaningful net outflows from Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). An estimated $153.11 million in losses over the past few months can be attributed to a total outflow of 1,818 BTC from these funds. The major force behind these outflows is a handful of large institutional players. Fidelity, for example, has seen an outflow of 939 BTC, valued at about $79.05 million. Despite this, however, the company still has in its custody a very impressive 194,270 BTC. This amounts to an approximate $16.36 billion commitment to holding Bitcoin. Mar 14 Update: 10 #Bitcoin ETFs NetFlow: -1,818 $BTC (-$153.11M) #Fidelity outflows 939 $BTC ($79.05M) and currently holds 194,270 $BTC ($16.36B). 9 #Ethereum ETFs NetFlow: -17,187 $ETH (-$33.24M) #iShares (Blackrock) outflows 8,175 $ETH ($15.81M) and currently holds 1,248,688… pic.twitter.com/RNfE43PmpU — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) March 14, 2025 The trend of Bitcoin institutional investment remains undoubted. Companies and investment firms continue to buy into Bitcoin, not only as an asset for capital appreciation but as a hedge against economic turmoil and inflationary pressures. This consistent demand from much larger players helps support the much broader Bitcoin ecosystem and could be the principal driver behind its long-term growth. Bitcoin’s Role in the Broader Financial Landscape Retail and institutional investors interact in complex ways, and the cryptocurrency Bitcoin is a prime example of this. We see that most of the early adopters of Bitcoin weren’t wholecoiners; they were just like you, me, and our listeners, holding a fraction of a Bitcoin (or less). Many of these non-wholecoiners have (or are in the process of) parting ways with the asset, seemingly due to the high levels of volatility that Bitcoin has exhibited over the past year. Now, in stark contrast, institutional buyers are embracing Bitcoin and taking a longer-term view, and this is super important to understand. Although smaller retail investors might withdraw from the market or cash in their profits, Bitcoin looks as if it’s building an uptrend—maybe even a bull market. Institutions and governments that seem to have little interest in ever selling are now holding onto remarkable amounts of BTC. At the same time, this is not a retail-driven market. Even if the retail side of the Bitcoin market falls, it hardly seems as if the Bitcoin price is in decadence. To conclude, Bitcoin’s marketplace is in a state of constant flux, shaped by the actions of retail and institutional investors alike. The non-wholecoiners’ tendency to sell off their holdings during market rallies is a trend that continues to emerge, one that, in many ways, seems to have been modeled off of the pattern we witnessed in late 2020. Of course, as we know, the past is not always prologue. That said, after you take a snapshot of the Bitcoin price action that occurred last week (i.e., the week of March 1, 2021) and overlay it with the price action that occurred in the last week of February 2021, the beginning of March 2021, and the first half of the second week of March 2021.

The latest analysis has shown that the most significant support level for Ethereum at present is $1,870, while its stoutest resistance level is $2,050. With market moves and whale activity greatly influencing the price of Ethereum, these key levels will be important to monitor as the asset attempts to navigate through its next phase. #Ethereum $ETH key levels to watch! On-chain data reveals $1,870 as the strongest support and $2,050 as its toughest resistance! pic.twitter.com/IBjUmQIjqU — Ali (@ali_charts) March 14, 2025 Whale Activity and Institutional Movements In the past five days, Ethereum has experienced huge buying activity from whales—big investors or entities that can actually move the market. In this short time, they have purchased over 420,000 ETH, which strongly indicates an accumulation phase. Now, this surge in whale buying would suggest, and is being taken, as a larger narrative of confidence being instilled in Ethereum by its bigger investors, who see it as a quasi-stable asset. Their purchases reflect, but also provide, confidence at some allegedly key support levels around $1,870, which might allow it, and not only it, but also its bigger holders, to avoid looking at new lows and consolidation before what could be taking it towards new highs. The influence of institutional investors has played a major role in shaping Ethereum’s market price. Whales aren’t the only ones moving the needle. Ethereum ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) are increasingly becoming a significant way for institutions and high-net-worth individuals to gain exposure to Ethereum without having to purchase, hold, or properly manage the asset themselves. However, recent data shows that Ethereum ETFs have seen a noticeable decline in net inflows. In fact, it’s not just net inflows that have been going in the wrong direction; recent data also show that net outflows have occurred. In total, the last reported net outflow was approximately 17,000 ETH (or about $33.24 million). Mar 14 Update: 10 #Bitcoin ETFs NetFlow: -1,818 $BTC (-$153.11M) #Fidelity outflows 939 $BTC ($79.05M) and currently holds 194,270 $BTC ($16.36B). 9 #Ethereum ETFs NetFlow: -17,187 $ETH (-$33.24M) #iShares (Blackrock) outflows 8,175 $ETH ($15.81M) and currently holds 1,248,688… pic.twitter.com/RNfE43PmpU — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) March 14, 2025 One of the primary contributors to the recent outflows has been iShares, a division of the investment giant BlackRock. Over the past few days, iShares has withdrawn 8,175 ETH, worth approximately $15.81 million. While this might seem like a concerning development at first glance, iShares still holds a very substantial position in Ethereum, with over 1.24 million ETH, or $2.41 billion at current market prices. This very substantial holding reflects BlackRock’s continued confidence in Ethereum’s potential, even as some assets are liquidated. Support and Resistance: Crucial Levels to Watch In this unstable atmosphere, the price of Ethereum is oscillating, and two essential price points are coming to the forefront: $1,870 as the main support and $2,050 as the resistance ceiling. The area around $1,870 has proven to be a robust support level. On-chain data confirms this as the price level where demand is likely to kick in and prevent Ethereum from correcting any more deeply. If prices dip toward that level, they present a pretty good buying opportunity for anyone looking to enter the Ethereum market at comparatively lower prices. If, however, prices were to break below that level, one would have to interpret that on-chain demand had failed and that further bearish momentum could be expected. Conversely, the $2,050 resistance stands as a formidable barrier for Ethereum to breach. This price level has served as a cap, restricting price increases on several occasions. For Ethereum to push past this resistance level, it probably needs to have continued astoundingly bullish price action. If Ethereum were to overcome the $2,050 strong resistance and hold up above that price level, it might just be the new catalyst to trigger a wave of buying that would push the price of the asset much higher and reestablish an upward trajectory. The Future of Ethereum Amid Changing Market Conditions Even with the recently seen outflows from Ethereum ETFs, the much bigger picture for Ethereum is an optimistic one. Institutional players are now involved in Ethereum, and those “whale” investors who tend to accumulate and hold large amounts of Ethereum are still doing so. So, these two groups certainly seem to convey Ethereum’s recent long-term strength. Ethereum’s ongoing transition to Ethereum 2.0 and the wider Layer 2 adoption not only fortify its standing as a leading blockchain platform but increasingly enable it to realize another aspect of its promise: a potential to be a mainstay in the cryptocurrency space. To sum up, even though we cannot avoid short-term volatility, the present market forces seem to confer a level of support at about $1,870 and a level of resistance at about $2,050 that Ethereum is struggling with. Whale activity continues to be dominant. Institutional players appear to be quite comfortable holding these assets, and with the price largely oscillating between these two levels, I would maintain that things seem to be going okay in terms of the overall health of the Ethereum asset and its market.

Remittix could unexpectedly steal the spotlight,https://crypto.news/could-2025-be-the-year-xrp-explodes-remittix-could-unexpectedly-steal-the-spotlight/,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. XRP’s dominance in blockchain payments is facing fresh competition as Remittix gains attention for its fee-free, real-time transactions. Table of Contents Will 2025 be XRP’s breakout year? Why investors are looking at Remittix as a contender Could Remittix overtake XRP in market growth? Which token holds the most long-term potential? Conclusion XRP remains arguably the most talked-about cryptocurrency with a number of analysts predicting a potential breakthrough in 2025. Despite XRP having been at the vanguard of blockchain-based payments for decades now, competition is building and contenders are emerging in the payments sector. Some of such emerging projects include Remittix (RTX), designed for fee-free, near-instant crypto-fiat payments. With XRP likely to receive a potential boost, multiple investors have started questioning: Will Remittix shockingly take center stage in 2025? Will 2025 be XRP’s breakout year? XRP currently trades at $2.30 and lost 5.09% in the last 24 hours. Despite the loss, XRP remains one of the strongest currencies with a market cap of $134.19 billion. Trading volume for XRP dropped 30.09% to $3.24 billion, and this signals some hesitation on the investor’s side. It would take much greater institutional adoption and regulatory clarity for XRP to go parabolic in 2025. Many investors believe XRP’s integration into global banking systems could bring immense demand and bring its value to all-time highs again. Though XRP remains a household name in cryptocurrency payments, newer entrants like Remittix are proving that blockchain-based payment innovation is far from over. Why investors are looking at Remittix as a contender Remittix is also emerging as a next-gen cryptocurrency payment system with fee-free and real-time conversion of currencies into fiat currencies. At $0.0734 per token, RTX raised nearly $13.9 million and sold 520 million tokens in evidence of strong early adoption. Compared to XRP for institutional finance, RTX targets individuals and companies and enables fast and smooth transfers with no banking intermediaries. For instance, an Asian freelancer servicing US-based clients can use RTX to receive payments in real time and avoid delayed bank processing. Since it streamlines cross-border payments, the majority of investors believe it could easily become the next major competitor to XRP in blockchain finance. You might also like: Cardano, XRP investors seeking higher gains turn to viral altcoins like Remittix Could Remittix overtake XRP in market growth? XRP has been a power to be reckoned with as a payment in the digital space but overdependence on regulatory approval and institutional endorsement has damped its adoption. RTX, by contrast, is quickly picking up users due to real-world use cases in payment. Since it offers crypto-to-fiat payment solutions, RTX is attracting business owners, freelancers, and retailers looking for a quicker and cheaper payment processing option. With the rise in demand for non-traditional banking services, analysts feel that in 2025, RTX could outshine XRP in percentage appreciation. Compared to XRP, which has existed for years now, RTX is in its infancy in regard to development and thus holds a much higher upside in regard to return potential. Which token holds the most long-term potential? As XRP and RTX battle for payment dominance, investors are considering their longer-term prospects. XRP remains a strong contender for bank access at the institutional level, but overhanging regulatory risk remains a concern. In the meantime, Remittix is targeting real-world use cases, making it increasingly accessible to the everyday user and placing it as a very viable contender in the cryptocurrency arena as it grows further. With growing crypto adoption, RTX is viewed by the majority of investors as a more suitable choice for real-world payments. As it is designed for fee-less transactions, it arrives with growing demand, thereby positioning itself as a better choice. While XRP continues to retain institutional appeal, RTX’s focus on usability and accessibility makes it more competitive, particularly for individuals and businesses seeking low-cost, efficient payment solutions. Conclusion As XRP sets up for its potential 2025 rally, so are investors looking at RTX as a rising star in blockchain finance. With its low transactional costs, fast payouts, and increasing adoption, RTX is fast emerging as a game-changer. Although XRP’s chances at reaching new highs still appear promising, Remittix looks increasingly likely to be a strong player in the blockchain payments market.

According to the latest crypto crime report, these illicit actors are increasingly turning to decentralized finance ( DeFi ) platforms to move and obscure funds. While traditional exchanges remain the main route for cashing out, a clear shift toward decentralized protocols has emerged as authorities strengthen their monitoring of digital transactions. The push toward DeFi comes in response to tougher Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations on centralized platforms. With authorities worldwide cracking down on illicit financial activities, darknet vendors are seeking alternative ways to store and transfer funds. Law enforcement agencies have also intensified their efforts, seizing digital assets and shutting down major laundering networks. As a result, vendors have begun moving a greater share of their proceeds into decentralized ecosystems, making it harder for authorities to track transactions. This transition is most visible among wholesale vendors, who operate at larger scales and need efficient ways to process significant amounts of digital currency. Smaller-scale retail vendors, on the other hand, are choosing to hold onto their earnings in private wallets for longer periods, delaying conversions to fiat to avoid detection. Beyond darknet operations, fraudulent schemes across multiple blockchains are also leveraging DeFi platforms to handle illicit funds. Despite this trend, centralized exchanges still dominate as the main method for laundering digital assets. However, the growing reliance on DeFi means that law enforcement agencies will need to evolve their tracking strategies. The increased use of decentralized platforms presents a challenge for regulators, who are now working to adapt their investigative techniques. Another significant shift in darknet market behavior is the change in preferred digital currencies for transactions. As authorities become more effective in tracing Bitcoin movements, vendors are increasingly adopting Monero (XMR), a privacy-focused cryptocurrency. Unlike Bitcoin, which operates on a transparent public ledger, Monero offers advanced privacy features such as ring signatures, stealth addresses, and confidential transactions, making it extremely difficult to trace senders and recipients. Authorities have dismantled several darknet markets in recent years, exposing the risks of using Bitcoin in illicit transactions. This has driven many darknet operators and cybercriminals to favor Monero as their primary payment method. The ability to obscure transaction details gives Monero an edge over Bitcoin, leading to its growing popularity among those seeking greater anonymity. Even with the rise in crypto-related crimes, darknet market revenues have declined compared to previous years. This drop reflects the growing pressure from law enforcement and regulatory bodies, which have made it harder for these platforms to operate as freely as before. While illicit actors continue to adapt, the overall trend suggests that efforts to disrupt illegal financial activities are having an impact. As authorities refine their enforcement strategies, the battle between law enforcement and digital financial crime continues. The increased use of DeFi and privacy coins signals an ongoing evolution in laundering tactics, forcing regulators to keep pace with the rapidly shifting landscape of digital finance.",,EN,0,0,XMR|REGULATION|BTC|MARKET|FIAT,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-17 09:08:09

This move adds to its growing investment strategy, pushing its total digital asset holdings beyond $340 million across multiple cryptocurrencies. Recent blockchain data revealed that WLFI allocated $2 million for the purchase of over 103,000 AVAX tokens, while another $2 million was used to acquire 2.45 million MNT tokens. These purchases further diversify WLFI’s portfolio, which already includes Ethereum ( ETH ), Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), Tron (TRX), Chainlink (LINK), Aave (AAVE), Ethena (ENA), Movement (MOVE), Ondo (ONDO), and SEI. The latest investments signal an ongoing expansion, though some analysts speculate that these transactions could be part of a broader token swap strategy. A crypto researcher observed that several projects in WLFI’s portfolio also maintain financial ties with the company, suggesting a pattern of reciprocal investments within the DeFi ecosystem. This strategy appears to strengthen WLFI’s influence in the blockchain space. Despite these acquisitions, WLFI's portfolio remains at a significant unrealized loss, with estimates pointing to a deficit of over $100 million. Ethereum alone accounts for a large portion of these losses, reflecting the volatile nature of digital asset investments. However, WLFI continues to expand its holdings, showing confidence in its long-term strategy. These developments come amid reports suggesting WLFI was in talks with Binance for a potential investment. Major financial news sources recently claimed the DeFi project had engaged in discussions with the exchange. However, WLFI strongly denied these claims, dismissing them as politically motivated and aimed at damaging the crypto sector’s reputation. The company instead reaffirmed its focus on decentralized finance, stating that it is committed to building a financial system aimed at democratizing access to digital assets. In its response, WLFI emphasized its partnerships with leading blockchain projects and its mission to promote financial inclusion. Additionally, WLFI recently concluded a successful token sale, raising hundreds of millions in funding. The project’s token will serve as its governance tool, allowing holders to participate in decision-making processes and shape the future of the platform. This decentralized model ensures that stakeholders play a direct role in determining key aspects of the project’s development. As WLFI continues to expand its crypto investments and strengthen its ecosystem, market observers remain focused on how its strategies will impact the broader DeFi landscape.",,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|BNB|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-17 09:12:49

Glassnode takes a look at a cost basis distribution (CBD) heatmap, which shows how many ETH positions break even at each price level and can often be used to pinpoint support and resistance zones. The firm says the metric is currently suggesting ETH has strong support at around the $1,886 level. “Ethereum’s Cost Basis Distribution (CBD) shows rising supply at $1,886, increasing from 1.6 million to 1.9 million ETH. This suggests a potential short-term price floor as investors accumulate at these levels, reinforcing support.” Source: Glassnode/X Glassnode says the $1,886 price level corresponds with its “Capitulation Metric” for ETH, which integrates CBD and data on realized loss. According to the firm’s chart, spikes in the Capitulation Metric often precede ETH rallies. Source: Glassnode/X Glassnode also reports a significant jump in the supply of stablecoins, which is often viewed as bullish for crypto due to the new potential liquidity they bring to markets. “Since Jan 1st, the aggregate stablecoin supply has increased by $20.17 billion (+10.9%), now reaching more than $205 billion. For comparison, the December peak clocked in at $187 billion but the supply actually contracted in the last two weeks of 2024 and dropped to $185 billion by January 2025.” Source: Glassnode/X At time of writing, ETH is trading at $1,890.

On March 19, the FOMC will announce its latest policy move, and all eyes are on whether it will hold interest rates steady. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, there is a 99% probability that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates unchanged. This decision is crucial as policymakers need to balance slowing growth with the ongoing threat of inflation. They also need to consider how to address uncertainties, especially around political events, such as the potential impact of ‘Trump uncertainty,’ as political instability or actions surrounding President Trump could affect the economy. The stock market has dropped to a six-month low as concerns about slowing economic growth and the impact of tariffs have shaken investor confidence. Monday’s release of February retail sales will start off the week’s economic reports. Fed To Keep Rates Unchanged? The recent stock market sell-off has raised concerns about slowing economic data, leading investors to expect about three interest rate cuts from the Fed in 2025. However, with inflation still above the Fed’s 2% target and potential impacts from tariffs and other policies pushing prices higher, the Fed is widely expected to keep rates unchanged on Wednesday. The main focus will be the Fed’s latest Summary of Economic Projections (SEP ), which includes the “dot plot” showing where policymakers think interest rates will go. Investors will also pay close attention to comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell during his press conference. Fed To Stress Patience When the Fed last updated its dot plot in December, it predicted that the fed funds rate would end 2025 between 3.75% and 4%, which suggests two 25-basis-point cuts this year, one less than what the market expects. Michael Gapen, chief US economist at Morgan Stanley, expects the Fed to emphasize “patience” due to ongoing fiscal uncertainty. He thinks Chair Powell will be cautiously optimistic about the economy but will point out the uncertain outlook because of high policy uncertainty. Third Rate Cut Expectations Decreases Short-term futures suggest that the Federal Reserve may start cutting rates in June, with three total cuts expected by the end of the year. However, the chance of a third cut in December has decreased due to mixed signals—slower growth due to declining consumer confidence and rising inflation expectations. The Fed has said they’ll act if unemployment rises but is focused on controlling inflation. The Fed is expected to keep rates steady at 4.25%-4.50% next week, with no cuts anticipated in May. Investors will closely watch the Fed’s updated projections for inflation, unemployment, and future rate decisions, to be released on March 18. In December, the Fed forecasted two rate cuts this year.",News|Fed,EN,0,0,MARKET|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-17 09:16:27

The proposal, which includes a government-backed digital asset stockpile, has faced resistance not only from Democrats but also from a significant portion of Republican voters. The findings suggest that while the initiative may have support within the crypto industry, public sentiment remains skeptical. The survey, conducted between March 8 and 10, 2025, polled over 1,000 likely voters on their views regarding government involvement in cryptocurrency. The results reveal that more than half of respondents disapprove of the idea, including a notable percentage of Republican supporters. The opposition is even stronger among Democrats, with a clear majority rejecting the plan, while many Independents also express disapproval. Trump recently signed an executive order to establish the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, initially relying on Bitcoin already held by the government. To minimize costs for taxpayers, the Treasury and Commerce Departments have been instructed to explore budget-neutral acquisition strategies. Despite these measures, the plan continues to face criticism, reflecting broader concerns over government investment in digital assets. Beyond the crypto reserve issue, the survey also highlights that a large number of Americans believe the government should reduce its financial support for cryptocurrency and blockchain development. A significant portion of respondents favor cutting federal funding in this sector, while others prefer maintaining current levels. Only a small fraction believes that government investment in the crypto industry should increase. Instead, many voters prioritize other areas of public spending. Social programs such as Social Security and Medicare receive overwhelming support for increased funding . Infrastructure projects, including transportation and public works, are also seen as more deserving of government resources. This contrast underscores a divide between the interests of crypto advocates and the broader electorate. The results suggest that while digital assets have gained traction in financial markets, they remain a lower priority for the general public. As Trump moves forward with his crypto policies, the challenge will be aligning government initiatives with voter expectations while balancing innovation with fiscal responsibility . The debate over federal involvement in cryptocurrency is likely to continue as policymakers navigate the evolving landscape of digital finance.",,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-17 09:17:25

A savvy investor turned a huge profit (at least on paper) after entering the ecosystem in its early days. The Impressive Spike Mubarak (MUBARAK) – a meme coin recently launched on the BNB Chain – has defied the ongoing market trend by registering a nearly 300% price increase on a daily scale . It currently trades at approximately $0.13, whereas its market capitalization stands at almost $120 million. MUBARAK Price, Source: CoinGecko The asset’s surge could be partially attributed to Binance’s founder, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), who supposedly entered the ecosystem. According to Lookonchain, he spent 1 BNB (around $600) to buy MUBARAK and the same amount to purchase TST (another meme coin created by the BNB Chain team). CZ’s engagement with tokens of that type comes as a surprise, considering one of his statements from February. Back then, Binance listed TST, and the founder assured that he had nothing to do with the decision. He also claimed he has never bought a “single meme coin so far.” Zhao is one of the most influential figures in the crypto space, and his interaction with the aforementioned assets could create significant hype and even a FOMO effect among other community members. However, inexperienced traders should be aware that such pumps are often short-lived and might be followed by a substantial correction. Another factor possibly fueling the rally for MUBARAK is the support from Binance Alpha. The initiative is designed to support the launch and development of innovative projects, including meme coins. It provides liquidity, visibility, and eventual exchange listings. What a Trade … Despite the risks of crucial losses, meme coins (especially those in their early days) have the potential to generate impressive profits for savvy investors. Lookonchain revealed the case of one such trader who spent less than $5,000 to purchase 12.35 million MUBARAK tokens a few days ago. Shortly after, they sold 2.35 million coins for 125 BNB (roughly $74,000) and kept 10 million MUBARAK. After the latest price pump, the current valuation of the stash has jumped to approximately $1.3 million.

The legislation, which received unanimous support, now awaits the governor’s signature and could solidify Kentucky’s reputation as a pro-crypto state. The bill, introduced by Representatives Adam Bowling and T.J. Roberts, ensures that individuals can hold and manage their own digital assets without interference. It also provides legal protections for Bitcoin miners by preventing unfair zoning regulations that could restrict mining activities. Additionally, it removes certain licensing requirements for small-scale miners, making it easier for independent participants to enter the industry. Kentucky’s Senate Majority highlighted the importance of these protections, emphasizing that node operators and staking providers will not be held liable for validated transactions. The bill also makes it clear that Bitcoin mining and staking activities are exempt from securities and money transmitter regulations, ensuring a more favorable environment for businesses operating in the space. The Attorney General’s Office has been granted the authority to enforce these exemptions. One of the most significant provisions in HB 701 is the clarification that Bitcoin mining and staking services will not be classified as securities. This distinction provides much-needed regulatory certainty for industry participants, reducing legal risks and encouraging further investment in the state’s crypto sector. Beyond self-custody and mining, the bill also protects the use of digital assets for payments. It explicitly states that digital assets used as payment will not be subject to additional taxes or fees beyond those applied to standard financial transactions. This measure aims to promote Bitcoin’s role as a medium of exchange and encourage its adoption in everyday commerce. With both legislative chambers approving HB 701, the bill is now awaiting the governor’s signature. If signed into law, it will reinforce Kentucky’s standing as a blockchain-friendly state, potentially attracting more businesses and innovation in the digital asset sector. At the same time, lawmakers are reviewing a separate proposal to establish a Bitcoin reserve. This initiative would allow Kentucky to allocate a portion of its surplus funds into digital assets as an alternative store of value. While the bill does not explicitly mention Bitcoin, it references digital assets with a market capitalization exceeding a specific threshold, a requirement currently met only by Bitcoin. Although this proposal is still under consideration, Kentucky’s approach reflects a growing trend among states looking to embrace cryptocurrency. By advancing pro-Bitcoin policies, the state positions itself as a leader in fostering blockchain adoption and innovation.",,EN,0,0,BTC|MINING|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-17 09:20:24

In a recent tweet, EGRAG CRYPTO stated, “XRP – No More Tapping Down,” suggesting that XRP must move beyond its repeated tests of lower support levels and establish a stronger upward trajectory. He highlighted the $3.00 price point as a crucial milestone, asserting, “XRP needs to close above $3.00 for bullish continuation.” This statement underlines the significance of this resistance level as a gateway to further gains. If XRP manages to break and sustain a price above this mark, it could signal a sustained bullish trend. #XRP – No More Tapping Down #XRP needs to close above $3.00 for #bullish continuation . We can't keep tapping the lower boundaries anymore! The more times we knock on that door, the greater the chance it will open . It’s time for #XRP to start trending upward! … pic.twitter.com/q7ALHVPY8S — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) March 14, 2025 Key Support and Resistance Levels to Watch EGRAG CRYPTO also pointed out the repeated testing of support levels, remarking, “We can’t keep tapping the lower boundaries anymore! The more times we knock on that door, the greater the chance it will open.” This comment reflects a common technical analysis principle: when a support level is repeatedly tested without breaking lower, it strengthens the likelihood of an upward breakout. Another critical price target mentioned in the tweet is $2.65. He stated, “It’s time for #XRP to start trending upward! $2.65 is the first critical closure.” This suggests that XRP must first secure a close above $2.65 before it can build momentum toward the $3.00 mark. The $2.65 level, therefore, serves as a short-term resistance that traders and investors are closely watching. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Technical Chart and Future Price Potential The chart shared by EGRAG CRYPTO illustrates XRP’s price movements , highlighting key technical zones. The blue area represents a range where XRP has been consolidating, while the yellow trendlines indicate long-term resistance levels. Notably, the chart projects a possible upward move, reaching as high as $4.80 if resistance levels are breached successfully. EGRAG CRYPTO concluded the tweet with, “#XRPFamily Together We Rise.” This statement resonates with the XRP community , which remains engaged in discussions about XRP’s price potential and broader market dynamics. The overall sentiment in the post suggests that if XRP manages to close above the identified resistance levels, the market could see further bullish momentum in the coming weeks. Market Outlook and Next Steps for XRP As the cryptocurrency market remains volatile, traders will monitor XRP’s performance closely. The next few trading sessions will determine whether the asset can build enough momentum to close above these critical resistance levels and sustain an upward trend. If XRP closes above $2.65 and then $3.00, it could confirm a bullish continuation, increasing optimism among investors and traders.

In a press conference, Kim reportedly said there was no attempt to cover up the incident, even though the audience pointed out the announcement was delayed. On Feb. 28, over 8.6 million WEMIX tokens were withdrawn due to an attack on the platform’s Play Bridge Vault, which transfers WEMIX to other blockchain networks. The company only made an official announcement four days after the attack. According to Kim, the announcement was delayed due to the possibility of further attacks and to avoid causing panic in the market because of the stolen assets. Related: Bank of Korea to take ‘cautious approach’ to Bitcoin reserve Wemix CEO outlines risks of premature announcement Wemix said the hacker broke into their system by stealing the authentication key for the company’s service monitoring system of Nile, its non-fungible token (NFT) platform. After the theft, the hacker spent two months preparing before randomly creating abnormal transactions. The hackers attempted to withdraw 15 times but only succeeded with 13 withdrawals, taking away 8.6 million WEMIX tokens and selling them in exchanges outside South Korea. Kim explained that upon becoming aware of the hack, they immediately shut down their servers and began their analysis. The executive added that they filed a complaint against the unidentified hacker with the Cyber Investigation Team of the Seoul National Police Agency. The Wemix CEO said the authorities had already started investigating the matter. Kim said that there was a risk in making a premature announcement. The CEO said that in a situation where the penetration method was not identified, they could be exposed to further attacks. Kim also reiterated that the market had already seen some impact from the sold assets, and they would risk panic selling if they announced it immediately. During the press release, the executive apologized to Wemix investors, saying that the disclosure delay was his call and that he should be held responsible if anything goes wrong. WEMIX token drops 39% amid hack announcement Despite the attempt to avoid causing market panic, the WEMIX token dropped by nearly 40% from the day of the exploit to March 4, when the company finally announced the hack. The price went from $0.70 on Feb. 27 to a low of $0.52 on Feb. 28. The price went down to $0.42 on March 4. At the time of writing, the crypto asset trades at $0.58, which is still 17% below its pre-hack price. WEMIX token price chart.

On March 14, James Howells revealed that the UK Court of Appeals denied his request to search a landfill where the drive is believed to be buried. “Appeal request to the Royal Court of Appeal: refused,” Howells posted on X, calling the decision an example of “The Great British Injustice System.” He criticized the courts for protecting government interests over individual rights and vowed to escalate the case to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). The latest rejection came from Judge Christopher Nugee, who ruled there was “no real prospect of success” and no compelling reason to grant the appeal . This follows an earlier dismissal by High Court Judge Andrew Keyser on January 9, who also concluded that Howells had no realistic chance of winning. Last Chance at the European Court of Human Rights With all UK legal avenues exhausted, Howells plans to argue that the British courts have violated his fundamental rights under the ECHR. He claims the government has breached Article 1 of Protocol 1 (right to property) and Article 6 (right to a fair trial). “The British establishment wants to sweep this under the carpet,” Howells stated. “I will not let them. No matter how long it takes, this will not go away.” While the ECHR cannot overturn a UK court decision, a ruling in Howells’ favor could pressure British authorities to reconsider their stance. He intends to file his claim in the coming weeks. Landfill Faces Closure Howells’ Bitcoin saga began in 2013 when his former partner accidentally threw away a bag containing the hard drive. Since then, he has been battling the Newport City Council, which has repeatedly denied his requests to search the landfill site at Docksway. The clock is ticking. The landfill is scheduled to close between 2025 and 2026, according to BBC News, meaning Howells could permanently lose access to his fortune if no legal breakthrough is made. His case is a cautionary tale in self-custody, emphasizing the risks of misplacing private keys.

His analysis is predicated upon liquidity trends and past market corrections, implying that there may be short-term volatility before gains we have yet to experience. In tandem with Bitcoin’s story, over on Mutuum Finance (MUTM), the project is gaining pace in its third presale phase at $0.02. Overall raising $3.6 million, with 5,800 holders already snaring tokens. With the potential for a Bitcoin pump on the horizon, it seems investors are looking at projects such as MUTM looking to ride the wave of optimism across the entire market with its presale rounds filling rapidly before an anticipated exchange listing. Mutuum Finance Presale Momentum As Bitcoin’s volatility floods headlines, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quietly building a following with its structured presale. At $0.02 per token, phase 3 is coming to an end—and the next stage has been set at $0.025, a 25% jump for existing investors. At launch, MUTM will list at $0.06, meaning that early participants stand to benefit from a 200% return. Additional to the presale gains, the project’s lending infrastructure and buy-back mechanism feed predictions of a post-launch rally to $3.50, equating to a 17,400% ROI for Phase 3 participants. In contrast to meme-driven tokens, MUTM’s ecosystem—comprising overcollateralized loans, mtTokens, and peer-to-peer lending—emphasizes sustainable demand that marries DeFi innovation with real-world financial utility. Lending Model Grounds Long-Lived Demand Aiming to suppress volatility a particular focus of Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The revenue of the platform is partially used to buy MUTM tokens in the open market automatically from stakers and liquidity providers. This leads to cyclical buy pressure and protects the token from massive sell-offs and rewards for long-term holders. Users must also keep mtTokens from the protocol, which earn interest over time, to encourage deposits, connecting user activity to token demand. Having onboarded 5,800 holders, the presale performance of the project highlights the confidence in its roadmap, which includes an overcollateralized stablecoin and audited smart contracts on the way. Ripple Effect from Bitcoin to the Strategic Altcoins The crypto market would have billions rushing into it, followed by a steady trickle of capital into promising altcoins if Bitcoin reached $250,000. Having extremely use cases and deflationary tokenomics such projects as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be acquiring most of this influx. Historically, BTC rallies lead to altcoin seasons, and presale structure allows early bird entrance at a discount, making it a top beneficiary. The post-launch spectacle price point of $3.50 for the token is an ambitious target but is within the ballpark of estimates for decentralized finance platforms poised to connect traditional finance with the efficiency of the blockchain. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) starts its third presale stage at $0.02 which is a pivotal point before the spike initiates to $0.025. Anyone buying tokens today gets a guaranteed 25% profit in front of Phase 4– and a 200% profit on listing in Phase 4 at $0.06. As Bitcoin’s seismic rally approaches and the canvas for MUTM’s ecosystem is ready to scale, the window for entry is closing. With market fluctuations driving accumulation, Hayes encourages strategic amassing with intent, within this construct, MUTM stands as an aware hedge—a currency imbued with practical application: real-word value as an intangible asset. When the bullish perspective for Bitcoin meets the acceleration of Mutuum Finance presale, opportunity emerges. Higher if Phase 3 fills up (and/or Bitcoin trajectory hints at altcoin success) — waiting on other investment risks getting out ahead of key returns well.

Earlier in 2024, Graphite Network launched its L1 blockchain that prioritizes trust, reputation, and equal rewards for all nodes contributing to the network. Now, with @G powering everything within its ecosystem – from account activation to transaction fees, the token’s debut on CEXs will not be just a milestone but rather a launchpad for broader adoption. The impact could mirror what other blockchains have seen. When Polygon (MATIC) was listed on Coinbase in 2021, its trading volume doubled within three months, and its developer community swelled as new users explored its ecosystem. Graphite Network’s @G listing aims for similar traction, leveraging CEXs as a springboard to draw in traders, developers, and everyday users. CEXs Have Become A Gateway to Crypto Adoption in 2024 The cryptocurrency market in 2024 was a whirlwind of growth and opportunity, a year that saw its total market capitalization climb to an all-time high of $3.91 trillion in December. This rise represented a shift in how the world interacts with digital assets. Two major catalysts stood out: the long-awaited approval of U.S. spot ETFs, which brought institutional money flooding in, and the steady stream of new tokens hitting CEXs, pulling in everyone from experienced traders to curious newcomers. Listings of new tokens acted like adrenaline shots to the market, sparking frenzied trading activity. Over the past year, the average daily trading volume across CEXs was at around $50 billion, with new token listings often driving 20-30% spikes in activity. For every new token listed, thousands of users who might’ve never touched a decentralized wallet get a chance to engage. It’s a ripple effect – higher volumes lead to better liquidity, which attracts more players, which in turn fuels adoption. After Thena (THE) Binance listing on November 27, Thena’s price skyrocketed by over 2,300%, reaching a new all-time high of $4.09. A similar case happened to the Neiro (NEIRO) memecoin that surged by nearly 7,600%. These listings didn’t just pad exchange stats, but they increased liquidity, tightened spreads, and made crypto feel less like a niche experiment and more like a mainstream investment vehicle. When a new token lands on a CEX, it’s not just another ticker symbol; it’s a signal of credibility and accessibility. Graphite Network aims to tap into the same energy that propelled tokens like THE and NEIRO into the mainstream. Beyond the CEX listing, the platform’s 2025 roadmap is all about expanding Web3 adoption and delivering industry-first, practical L2 solutions with reputation-driven mechanics and real-world applications. More From Graphite Network’s 2025 Roadmap Graphite Network has a year-long plan split into several phases that blend infrastructure upgrades, partnerships, and groundbreaking applications. Here’s what’s on deck, straight from their announcement: First Six Months of 2025: Laying the Groundwork Graphite kicks off the year by fortifying its foundation. Ecosystem tweaks – like wallet upgrades and instant exchange features – will make the platform slicker and more intuitive. The standout, though, is the Market Staking Program. Unlike traditional staking , which rewards passive holding (often yielding 5-15% APY but diluting token value), this program will pay traders some extra rewards based on their trading volume on DEXs like Uniswap and Curve, where @G is currently listed. The CEX listing will hit in Q2, paired with strategic partnerships across blockchain projects and enterprises to weave Graphite Network into the Web3 fabric. Among other developments, they will launch the Phonebook Reputation MVP, a decentralized identity tool that ties reputation metrics to phone numbers via smart contracts, offering a trust layer for DeFi and TradFi platforms needing verified users without compromising privacy. Q3 2025: Web3 Meets Real Life In Q3, Graphite Network is set to release a reputation-based dating app MVP, which will be a Web-3 online dating app that uses blockchain technology to verify profiles and cut scams. There will also be a Hotspot Bundle initiative that provides internet connections to underserved regions to let more users join the decentralized economy. It’s equity in action, ensuring Web3 isn’t just for the connected elite. Q4 2025: Governance and Tokenization For Graphite Network, the year will close with the launch of a competitive voting system that ties influence to reputation, not just wealth, tackling a nagging flaw in decentralized governance. They will also launch the DePIN Geo Game, which will blend gaming with tokenized real-world objects—an auction-driven, inflation-modeled experience that could redefine how we interact with physical assets on-chain. Graphite Network’s roadmap is a blueprint for bridging TradFi and Web3. Every step – from @G’s CEX debut to Market Staking Program to reputation-based L2 apps – targets real-world pain points, proving that blockchain can be more than a speculative sandbox. If Graphite Network pulls this off, 2025 might not just be this blockchain’s year – it could be a turning point for crypto adoption at large.

Game Beast, a name previously synonymous with innovative blockchain-based entertainment, has just unleashed a powerful transformation. They’ve rebranded themselves as Ephyra , and this isn’t just a name change – it signals a bold new direction focused on the cutting edge of artificial intelligence. Adding fuel to this exciting evolution, Ephyra has successfully secured a whopping $10.5 million in Series A funding, spearheaded by Becker Ventures. This significant financial injection is poised to propel Ephyra to the forefront of the web3 gaming revolution. Let’s dive into what this means for gamers, developers, and the future of decentralized entertainment. Why the Rebrand to Ephyra and Focus on AI Gaming ? The move from Game Beast to Ephyra isn’t merely cosmetic; it’s a strategic pivot that reflects the company’s deepened commitment to innovation and the burgeoning potential of AI gaming . In today’s rapidly evolving tech landscape, simply being a ‘beast’ in the game isn’t enough. Ephyra’s rebranding suggests a move towards a more sophisticated, intelligent, and forward-thinking approach. But why AI? Here’s why this focus is a game-changer: Enhanced Player Experiences: Imagine games that adapt to your playstyle in real-time, offering dynamic difficulty adjustments, personalized storylines, and non-player characters (NPCs) that feel genuinely intelligent and responsive. AI can make this a reality, creating richer, more immersive, and endlessly engaging gaming worlds. Next-Level Game Development: AI tools can streamline and accelerate game development processes. From procedural content generation (creating vast landscapes and diverse characters automatically) to intelligent testing and debugging, AI can empower developers to build bigger, better, and more complex gaming experiences faster. Unlocking New Gameplay Mechanics: AI opens doors to entirely new forms of gameplay. Think about emergent narratives driven by AI, dynamic ecosystems that evolve based on player actions, or even AI-powered game masters that create unique and unpredictable challenges. Personalized Metaverse Gaming Experiences: As the metaverse continues to develop, AI will be crucial in creating personalized and adaptive experiences within these virtual worlds. Ephyra’s focus on AI suggests they are looking to build metaverses that are not just visually stunning but also deeply intelligent and responsive to individual users. $10.5M Series A Funding: Fueling the AI Gaming Revolution Securing $10.5 million in Series A funding is a monumental achievement for Ephyra and a clear indicator of investor confidence in their vision. Led by Becker Ventures, this funding round will be instrumental in realizing Ephyra’s ambitious plans. But how exactly will this capital be deployed? Here are some key areas: Expanding the AI Development Team: A significant portion of the funding will likely be directed towards recruiting top-tier AI talent. Developing cutting-edge AI for gaming requires specialized expertise in areas like machine learning, neural networks, and natural language processing. Platform Development and Infrastructure: Building a robust and scalable platform capable of supporting AI-driven gaming experiences is crucial. The funding will enable Ephyra to invest in the necessary infrastructure, including servers, cloud computing resources, and advanced development tools. Content Creation and Game Development: Developing compelling games and experiences that showcase the power of AI is paramount. Ephyra will likely use the funding to accelerate their own game development efforts and potentially partner with other studios to create a diverse portfolio of AI gaming titles. Marketing and Community Building: Raising awareness and building a strong community around Ephyra is essential for long-term success. The funding will support marketing initiatives to reach gamers, developers, and investors, and to foster a vibrant ecosystem around their platform. Becker Ventures: Strategic Backing for Crypto Gaming ‘s Next Chapter The leadership of Becker Ventures in this Series A round is noteworthy. Becker Ventures is known for its strategic investments in innovative technology companies, and their backing of Ephyra underscores the immense potential they see in the intersection of AI and crypto gaming . What does this partnership signify? Industry Validation: Becker Ventures’ investment serves as a strong validation of Ephyra’s vision and strategy. It signals to the broader market that AI gaming in the Web3 space is not just a trend but a significant and investable opportunity. Strategic Guidance and Network: Beyond financial capital, Becker Ventures likely brings valuable strategic guidance and access to a broad network of industry contacts. This support can be instrumental in helping Ephyra navigate the complexities of the crypto gaming and AI sectors. Long-Term Vision Alignment: Venture capital investments are typically long-term commitments. Becker Ventures’ involvement suggests a shared long-term vision with Ephyra for the future of gaming , one where AI and blockchain technologies converge to create unprecedented experiences. Challenges and Opportunities Ahead for Ephyra While Ephyra’s rebranding and funding are incredibly positive developments, the path ahead is not without its challenges. Successfully integrating AI into web3 gaming and building a thriving platform requires navigating several hurdles: Challenges Opportunities AI Development Complexity: Creating truly intelligent and engaging AI in games is a technically demanding undertaking. First-Mover Advantage: Ephyra has the opportunity to be a pioneer in AI-driven web3 gaming , establishing a strong brand and attracting early adopters. User Adoption of Web3 Gaming: While interest is growing, web3 gaming is still relatively nascent. Widespread adoption requires overcoming user skepticism and making blockchain technology more accessible and user-friendly. Untapped Market Potential: The market for web3 gaming is vast and largely untapped. Ephyra is positioned to capitalize on the explosive growth potential of this sector. Competition: The gaming and AI industries are highly competitive. Ephyra will need to differentiate itself and continuously innovate to stay ahead. Partnership Opportunities: Collaboration with other gaming studios, AI developers, and blockchain platforms can accelerate Ephyra’s growth and expand its reach. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for crypto and blockchain technologies is still evolving. Ephyra will need to navigate these regulations carefully to ensure compliance and sustainability. Shaping the Future of Gaming: Ephyra has the potential to significantly influence the future direction of the gaming industry, pushing the boundaries of interactive entertainment and creating new paradigms for player engagement. Conclusion: Ephyra – Powering Up the Future of Play Ephyra’s rebranding and $10.5 million funding round mark a pivotal moment for the company and the web3 gaming space as a whole. By doubling down on AI and securing significant investment, Ephyra is signaling its ambition to lead the charge in a new era of intelligent, immersive, and decentralized gaming . While challenges undoubtedly lie ahead, the opportunities are immense. Keep a close eye on Ephyra – they are poised to be a major force in shaping the future of how we play, interact, and experience virtual worlds. This is more than just a rebrand; it’s a revolution in the making, promising to redefine the very fabric of gaming as we know it.

Data from analytics platform DefiLlama shows that PancakeSwap recorded $1.639 billion in 24-hour trading volume on Monday, Mar. 17, overtaking Uniswap ( UNI ) and Raydium ( RAY ), which saw $1.021 billion and $334.98 million, respectively. https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1900114634121601493 The surge in trading volume apparently comes after Binance founder Changpeng Zhao reignited interest in memecoins, indirectly promoting BNB Chain-based memecoin MUBARAK on his social media profiles . https://twitter.com/ai_9684xtpa/status/1901228953857298777 A few days later, on-chain analysts reported that a crypto address associated with Zhao spent 1 Binance Coin ( BNB ) to purchase MUBARAK, though it’s unclear how much Zhao-backed promotion affected activity around the token. As of press time, MUBARAK soared over 270% in the past seven days. Data from PancakeSwap V3 shows that following Zhao’s mentioning of MUBARAK, the token soared to the third most traded asset on the platform, behind only Tether ( USDT ) and Wrapped BNB.

A stark warning has been issued from across the Atlantic, directly pointing fingers at the United States’ approach to crypto. François Villeroy, the Governor of the Bank of France, has voiced serious concerns that policies emerging from the U.S. could be sowing the seeds for a future financial crisis. This isn’t just another market fluctuation warning; it’s a central banker highlighting systemic risks. Let’s delve into why this is making headlines and what it could mean for your crypto investments and the broader global economy. Why is the French Central Bank Governor Sounding the Alarm on US Crypto Policy? François Villeroy’s apprehension, as reported by DL News and originally published in La Tribune Dimanche, isn’t based on speculation. It’s rooted in historical patterns and current trends. He explicitly pointed out that financial instability often originates in the U.S. before rippling across the globe. His specific concern revolves around what he perceives as the U.S. administration’s lenient stance towards cryptocurrencies and the burgeoning non-bank financial sector. He fears this combination is creating an environment ripe for future economic shocks. To understand the gravity of this warning, consider these key points: Historical Precedent: Financial crises, like the 2008 global financial crisis, often have roots in the U.S. due to its central role in the global financial system. Villeroy is drawing a parallel, suggesting that unchecked policies in the U.S., especially in emerging sectors like crypto, could have similar widespread consequences. Support for Crypto and Non-Bank Financing: The Governor highlights the U.S. administration’s apparent support for cryptocurrencies and non-traditional financial institutions. While innovation is crucial, unregulated or lightly regulated growth in these areas can lead to excessive risk-taking and systemic vulnerabilities. Global Interconnectedness: The modern financial world is deeply interconnected. What happens in the U.S. financial market doesn’t stay in the U.S. Cryptocurrencies, by their very nature, are global assets, making them particularly susceptible to transmitting financial shocks internationally. Seeds of Future Upheavals: Villeroy’s strong language – “sowing the seeds of future upheavals” – underscores the severity of his concern. He believes that current U.S. policies, if left unaddressed, are actively creating the conditions for a future financial crisis. Understanding the Potential Risks: How Could US Crypto Policy Trigger a Financial Crisis? The core issue isn’t necessarily cryptocurrency itself, but rather the regulatory landscape surrounding it, particularly within the U.S. If policies are perceived as too lax or unclear, it can lead to several risk factors that could contribute to a broader financial crisis: Lack of Investor Protection: Insufficient cryptocurrency regulation can leave investors vulnerable to fraud, market manipulation, and project failures. Widespread losses in the crypto market, especially among retail investors, can have ripple effects on the broader economy. Systemic Risk from Non-Bank Financial Institutions: The rise of non-bank financial institutions in the crypto space, if not properly supervised, can create systemic risks. These institutions may operate with less stringent capital requirements and oversight than traditional banks, potentially amplifying market volatility and risks. Money Laundering and Illicit Activities: Weak US crypto policy could facilitate money laundering and other illicit activities. This not only undermines the integrity of the financial system but can also have broader geopolitical implications. Contagion Effect: A crisis in the crypto market could spread to traditional financial markets. If financial institutions have significant exposure to crypto assets or related derivatives, a crypto market crash could trigger losses and instability in the broader financial system. Impact on the Global Economy: Given the U.S.’s economic influence, a financial crisis originating from its crypto policies could have devastating consequences for the global economy . This could manifest as reduced trade, decreased investment, and widespread economic recession. Is Cryptocurrency Regulation the Solution? Many argue that robust cryptocurrency regulation is not just desirable but essential to mitigate the risks highlighted by Governor Villeroy. But what kind of regulation is needed, and what are the potential benefits and challenges? Benefits of Effective Crypto Regulation: Enhanced Investor Protection: Clear rules and oversight can protect investors from fraudulent schemes and unfair market practices, fostering greater confidence in the crypto market. Reduced Systemic Risk: Proper regulation can help to manage and mitigate systemic risks associated with crypto assets and non-bank financial institutions, preventing contagion to the traditional financial system. Combating Illicit Finance: Stronger regulatory frameworks can make it harder to use cryptocurrencies for money laundering, terrorism financing, and other illegal activities. Promoting Innovation and Growth: Well-designed regulation can provide clarity and certainty, encouraging responsible innovation and sustainable growth in the crypto sector. Level Playing Field: Consistent and fair regulations can create a level playing field for all participants in the crypto market, fostering competition and efficiency. Challenges of Implementing Crypto Regulation: Global Coordination: Cryptocurrencies are global, requiring international cooperation to develop and enforce effective regulations. Divergent approaches across jurisdictions can create loopholes and regulatory arbitrage. Technological Complexity: The rapidly evolving nature of crypto technology makes it challenging for regulators to keep pace and develop rules that are both effective and adaptable. Balancing Innovation and Risk: Regulations need to strike a delicate balance between fostering innovation and mitigating risks. Overly restrictive rules could stifle innovation, while lax rules could lead to instability. Defining Crypto Assets: Classifying different types of crypto assets (e.g., securities, commodities, currencies) is complex and crucial for determining the appropriate regulatory framework. Enforcement Challenges: Enforcing regulations in the decentralized and borderless crypto space presents significant challenges for authorities. Navigating Crypto Risks in an Uncertain Regulatory Environment Given the current uncertainties surrounding US crypto policy and the potential for future financial instability, what actionable insights can crypto investors and stakeholders take away? Actionable Insight Description Stay Informed: Keep abreast of regulatory developments in the U.S. and globally. Monitor statements from central banks and financial authorities regarding crypto risks. Diversify Investments: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your investment portfolio across different asset classes to mitigate risk in case of a crypto market downturn. Understand Risk Tolerance: Assess your personal risk tolerance. Crypto investments are inherently volatile and risky. Invest only what you can afford to lose. Due Diligence: Conduct thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency or crypto project. Understand the technology, team, and potential risks involved. Utilize Risk Management Tools: Use tools like stop-loss orders and portfolio tracking to manage your crypto investments effectively and limit potential losses. The Global Economy at a Crossroads? Governor Villeroy’s warning serves as a critical reminder that the burgeoning crypto market is not immune to systemic risks and can have significant implications for the global economy . While cryptocurrencies offer exciting opportunities for innovation and financial inclusion, their rapid growth and evolving nature demand careful consideration and proactive regulatory measures. Ignoring these warnings could indeed “sow the seeds of future upheavals,” as the Governor suggests, potentially leading to a financial crisis that could impact everyone. The coming months and years will be crucial in determining how US crypto policy evolves and whether global regulators can effectively address the challenges and risks associated with this rapidly transforming sector. The stakes are high, and the time for decisive action may be now.

Arctic Pablo Could Be the Best New Meme Coin to Join Now,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-the-dogwifhat-wave-arctic-pablo-could-be-the-best-new-meme-coin-to-join-now/,"The crypto world is buzzing with excitement, and if you’ve been keeping an eye on the meme coin market, you’ve likely seen the meteoric rise of projects like Dogwifhat. These coins have gained massive popularity, driven by excitement, community support, and a little bit of whimsy. But here’s the kicker—if you missed out on the early days of Dogwifhat, don’t sweat it. There’s a new opportunity emerging on the horizon, and it goes by the name of Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC). Arctic Pablo Coin offers the perfect blend of adventure, mythology, and profit potential. Much like the early days of Dogwifhat, Arctic Pablo is still in its presale phase, meaning there’s an incredible chance to secure your entry point before the price skyrockets. But, just like Dogwifhat, once the presale is over and the coin hits the broader market, you may regret not acting sooner. In this article, we’ll break down the story of Arctic Pablo, compare it to Dogwifhat, and explain why now is the best time to dive into this thrilling meme coin journey. Arctic Pablo: A New Meme Coin Journey You Won’t Want to Miss Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) isn’t just another meme coin—it’s an adventure. At the heart of this coin lies a unique narrative that combines exploration, discovery, and a bit of fantasy. The story goes like this: a daring adventurer named Arctic Pablo embarks on a journey through icy realms, where he uncovers mystical $APC coins. These aren’t just any tokens; they’re symbols of untold riches and untapped potential, inviting others to join the journey toward prosperity. It’s not just about making money—it’s about becoming part of an epic adventure that transcends the ordinary. Arctic Pablo doesn’t follow the typical presale structure unlike other meme coins. Instead of dividing the presale into stages, each presale round is a “location” where Pablo travels deeper into the frosty realms.

While the US President’s pro-crypto stance and progressive policies receive widespread recognition, global powers like Europe raise concerns. While Europe raises concerns about the policies’ impact on the continent’s economic stability, France warns of an impending global financial crisis. Notably, the European Union has raised eyebrows over Donald Trump’s crypto policies that could have far-reaching implications over the continent’s financial stability. Adding fuel to the concern, French Central Bank Governor François Villeroy de Galhau shed light on a potential economic crisis. Let’s explore Donald Trump’s progressive crypto policies and their possible implications on the global financial landscape. Donald Trump’s Crypto Policies: France Warns of Global Financial Crisis According to recent reports, French Central Bank Governor François Villeroy de Galhau expressed concerns over US President Donald Trump’s crypto policies. The Governor warned against a possible global financial crisis resulting from Trump’s pro-crypto stance. In an interview with French weekly La Tribune Dimanche, Villeroy de Galhau stated, The United States risks sinning through negligence…Financial crises often originate in the United States and spread to the rest of the world. By encouraging crypto assets and non-bank finance, the American administration is sowing the seeds of future upheavals. Interestingly, Villeroy de Galhau’s statement takes on added significance in light of the five biggest financial crises that emerged in the United States. These crises include The Great Depression, the OPEC Oil Price Shock of 1973, and the Great Recession. With his statement, the Governor conveys that Trump’s crypto policies could bring in the next biggest economic recession in the world. Increased Attack on Trump’s Crypto Policies: What To Know? Significantly, Villeroy de Galhau posited that the major shift in the US crypto regulatory environment marks a menacing trend. He asserted that the “current wave of American deregulation is dangerous.” This is not the first instance of the French central bank governor expressing reservations about Donald Trump’s cryptocurrency policies. Previously, even before Trump’s inauguration as the US President, Villeroy de Galhau stated, “I believe that what we sometimes hear in the United States about the lack of regulation of non-banks, the various funds (…) or the lack of regulation of crypto-assets is something that would put financial stability at risk.” In addition, Trump’s crypto policies, including his Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, have sparked controversies. Critics like crypto journalist Zack Guzmán and former White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci invoke thoughts over the possible damage Trump’s stance could bring to the industry’s credibility. Guzmán fears Trump’s involvement may jeopardize the industry’s reputation, while Scaramucci went as far as labeling Trump’s approach as “Idi Amin-level corruption.” However, asset manager Franklin Templeton praises Trump’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve , asserting that it could boost the country’s economic stability. Europe Fears Financial Instability Apart from France’s warning about a potential global financial crisis, the European continent is concerned about maintaining its own economic stability. Recently, A European Union official posited that Donald Trump’s crypto policies could risk the continent’s control over its monetary system. At a conference, European Stability Mechanism’s Managing Director Pierre Gramegna stated, “The US administration is favorable towards cryptocurrencies and especially dollar-denominated stablecoins, which may raise certain concerns in Europe.” Despite concerns surrounding Trump’s influence, Europe has emerged as a leader in crypto banking . The continent has successfully surpassed the US in integrating cryptocurrency services with traditional banking. While the US is still working to streamline connections between banks and the crypto industry, Europe has already established a strong foothold in this space.

During the same period, the Nasdaq 100 index has seen a significant decline of 10.94%. Interestingly, during this period, Bitcoin, known as digital gold , has witnessed a fall of 13.52%, indicating that the BTC market is currently following the trend of the US stock market. Highlighting this, popular gold advocate Peter Schiff challenges the attempt to push Bitcoin to the status of Gold – the most reliable store of value. Curious to know more? Read on! Schiff Predicts Bitcoin Crash if Nasdaq Falls At the start of this year, the Nasdaq composite index was at $19,401. Between January 1 and February 27, the market remained within the range of $20,087.23 to $18,902.75. On February 27, with a significant single-day drop of 3.46%, the market slipped below the range. Since February 20 alone, the composite index has declined by over 11.34%. Likewise, at the beginning of the year, the Bitcoin price was around $93,587.07. Between January 1 and February 24, the market remained within the range of $92,540.01 and $106,151.77. Even though, on January 20, buyers attempted to push the price as high as $109,568.48, by the time of closing, the price of BTC plummeted to $102,294.18. On February 24, with a serious single-day of 4.97%, the price dropped below the range. Since February 20 alone, the BTC market has registered a drop of 13.52%. Data show that the Bitcoin market is currently following the trend of the US stock market. Peter Schiff compares the present scenario in the market with the Dot-com bubble, 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 COVID-19 crash. Schiff predicts that if Nasdaq drops 20%, Bitcoin could hit $65K. He also forecasts that if the Nasdaq index slips 40%, the BTC market may crash to $20K or even lower. Currently, the price of Bitcoin stands at $83,559.98 – at least 31.39% below the all-time high. Gold Rising as Nasdaq Falls Highlighting the potential of gold as a strong hedge against US economic uncertainties, Schiff notes that gold has increased by at least 13% while the Nasdaq has declined. At the start of 2025, the gold spot price was around $2,624.653. Since then, the gold spot market has witnessed a rise of 13.86%. Between January 1 and February 24 alone, the market experienced a rise of 12.46%. Even since February 20, the market has seen a surge of 1.83%. Currently, the gold spot price stands at $2,989.380. Schiff also forecasts that if stocks keep falling, gold could surpass $3,800. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Price Prediction for this Week , Bitcoin’s Credibility at Risk? Exposing how Bitcoin has failed to rise to the status of gold as a reliable store of value and a strong hedge against economic uncertainties, Schiff expresses concerns about the feasibility of the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve proposal. He states that if BTC crashes during economic uncertainties , governments may have no reason to hold it in their reserves. He warns that Bitcoin ETF investors could panic and sell their holdings. He even points out that If BTC drops sharply, even MicroStrategy may need to sell its holdings. MicroStrategy is the publicly traded company that holds the largest number of BTC tokens. It owns no fewer than 499,096 BTC tokens , valued at $41,682,990,650. The company has been a dedicated advocate of corporate crypto adoption . In November 2024, it even recommended tech giants like Microsoft adopt its aggressive crypto-buying strategy. Importantly, the short-term success achieved by this public company has encouraged many other companies to reverse their stance on crypto adoption. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

But this time? Skyren DAO’s spokesperson took things to a whole new level — by attempting to eat the microphone. Yes. You read that correctly. LIVE on-air. What started as a regular interview turned into one of the most bizarre moments in crypto history — and now, everyone’s talking about Skyren DAO’s presale, AI-driven DeFi, and staking rewards. Let’s break down how a microphone became the meal of the day, why this moment sent Skyren DAO trending, and how investors are piling into SKYRN before the presale ends. The Incident: When a Microphone Became a Snack Everything was normal — until it wasn’t. Skyren DAO’s spokesperson was midway through explaining how AI automates airdrop collection when suddenly… They leaned in. Opened their mouth. And took a bite of the microphone. The host’s face? Absolute shock. The live chat? Exploding with “WTF” and “Did they just EAT the mic?” Crypto Twitter? Already creating memes before the interview even ended. If there’s one thing the crypto community loves, it’s an absurd viral moment — and Skyren DAO just delivered an all-timer. Mic NFT collections launched within hours. Memes comparing the spokesperson to a “DeFi Goat” (literally eating everything in sight). Even Vitalik Buterin commented: “Some projects eat the competition. Literally.” This wasn’t just a meme moment — it became free marketing for Skyren DAO. Skyren DAO: The DeFi Project That’s Actually Delivering While everyone is laughing about the mic incident, smart investors are getting in before the Skyren DAO presale ends.

As of today, the cryptocurrency is trading at $83 518. The second most capitalized cryptocurrency Ethereum also started the day with a slight increase. At the time of writing, the coin is trading at $1 902. In the top 10 most capitalized cryptocurrencies, the best result in a day (+2.83%) and a week (+12.04%) is for BNB. The biggest loss in 24 hours is Solana (-4.97%) and in seven days is TRON (-9.30%). In the top 100 of the most capitalized cryptocurrencies, the best result for the day (+34.86%) and the week (+55.55%) was recorded by Binary. During the last 24 hours, Pi (-8.46%) lost in price more actively than others. Ethena (-16.70%) recorded the biggest losses for the week. Top Crypto News of the Morning of March 17 South Korea's central bank commented on the possibility of including bitcoin in the country's reserve. The regulator's position on the issue was revealed in response to a written request from National Assembly member Cha Kyu-geun, reports The Korea Herald . The Bank of Korea noted that bitcoin's high volatility and possible difficulties in liquidating the asset in case of instability in the crypto market make it unsuitable for foreign exchange reserves. The central bank also emphasized that reserves should have high liquidity and an investment grade credit rating. Bitcoin, according to the regulator's representatives, does not meet the requirements. Earlier, some Democratic Party officials and crypto-lobbyists urged authorities to consider including bitcoin in government reserves and create a stablecoin backed by South Korean won. The initiative to form a bitcoin reserve has also faced pressure in the U.S. The court ordered crypto platform Debiex to pay $2.5 million in a fraud case. This decision was made by a federal court in Arizona in a lawsuit brought by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The CFTC filed a lawsuit against Debiex in January 2024, claiming the platform used a fraudulent crypto romance scam, convincing victims to invest in cryptocurrency. Five people transferred about $2.3 million to the platform, which was then stolen. The court ordered Debiex to recover that amount, as well as $221,500 in fines. Judge Douglas Reyes noted that the defendant had no valid reasons for ignoring the lawsuit. Angel investor Jason Calacanis, known for early investments in Uber and Robinhood, said that Calacanis argues that any technology eventually becomes obsolete and bitcoin will be no exception. However, representatives of the bitcoin industry, including Swan Bitcoin co-founders Brady Swenson and Corey Klippsten, disagree. They stated that successful protocols are not replaced, but augmented with new layers. Lightspark CEO David Marcus noted that bitcoin's shortcomings can be eliminated with second-level solutions. In turn, ShapeShift CEO Eric Voorhees added that the missing features can be implemented in other blockchains. Some experts, such as Stacks co-founder Muneeb Ali, believe that most existing second-tier bitcoin solutions will disappear in the next three years. However, others, including crypto-enthusiast Wayne Vaughan, argue that the larger the bitcoin network, the harder it is to replace. Strive Funds CEO Matt Cole emphasized that there is no ”better bitcoin” and trying to find an alternative will result in losses.",News|Reviews,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|ASIA,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-17 10:03:00

At this point, a crypto whale also opened a short position worth millions of dollars in Hyperliquid. According to Lookonchain's post, the whale with the address Cbb0fe opened a short position of over $445 million in BTC with 40x leverage. The whale's liquidation price was $86,000. Seeing this, a team took action to liquidate the whale and increased the price of Bitcoin, but they were unsuccessful in liquidating the whale. While the team could only push the Bitcoin price up to $84,690, the whale added another 5 million USDC to its position to protect against the risk of liquidation. “This whale was hunted by a team and still managed to make a profit! 11 hours ago, Cbb0fe formed a team to hunt down this whale who was shorting BTC with 40x leverage. Just an hour later, the team took action and quickly pushed BTC above $84,690. However, the attempt failed. “The whale is currently making a profit by closing positions on Twap. His current position is 5,406 BTC (worth $449 million) and his unrealized profit is $4.4 million.” While the whale expects a decrease in the price of Bitcoin, he opened a 5x long position in MELANIA, stating that he expects an increase in the memecoin of Melania Trump, the wife of US President Donald Trump. https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1901469533224968503 *This is not investment advice.

While several projects are gearing up for a major surge, others, such as Cardano (ADA), struggle with uncertainty and delayed acceptance. If you're looking for the best altcoins to buy right now, here are five standouts: Rexas Finance (RXS), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Hyperliquid (HYPE), Aptos (APT), and Ripple (XRP)—all while avoiding ADA's potential problems. Rexas Finance (RXS): The Utility-Driven Altcoin Leads the Market Thanks to its innovative method of real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, Rexas Finance (RXS) is becoming one of the most sought-after cryptocurrencies of 2025. Rexas Finance is meant to close the gap between traditional finance and blockchain, enabling investors to tokenize assets such as real estate, commodities, and financial instruments. The RXS presale was a huge success, with eleven phases completed ahead of schedule. Stage 12 (the Final Stage) is 90% sold out as of press time. RXS is priced at $0.20, a staggering 566% increase over its Stage 1 price of $0.03. The presale has already raised $46.7 million, indicating significant investor confidence ahead of its highly anticipated June 19th exchange debut. Rexas Finance is disrupting conventional wisdom by enabling individuals to invest in high-value assets, such as real estate or fine art, for as little as $50. For instance, if a hotel valued at $1 million is tokenized, an investor can purchase a tiny portion of the tokenized asset, exposing herself to once-unreachable valuable markets. In the DeFi sector, RXS powers staking, yield farming, and governance, providing token holders with many methods to earn rewards. Security is also a focus, with Rexas AI Shield continually monitoring smart contracts and backed by a Certik audit to ensure investor protection. Rexas Finance is also holding a $1 million giveaway right now, and over 1.5 million entries have already been received. The top 20 participants can each win $50,000 in RXS, drawing more attention to the project ahead of its official market debut. The most appealing aspect for RXS investors is its upcoming exchange debut on at least three of the top ten cryptocurrency platforms. Tokens are priced at $0.25 each. With good liquidity and a strong demand forecast, analysts foresee a huge price increase, making RXS a must-have altcoin before the bull market begins. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Can Burn Rate Acceleration Cause a 400% Rally? Shiba Inu (SHIB) is showing symptoms of a potential breakout, aided by its aggressive token burn plan. Over the past 24 hours, SHIB's burn rate has risen by 531%, deleting about 14 million tokens from the system. SHIB trades at $0.00001355. The token's price has fallen below its 20-day EMA of $0.000015, indicating short-term bearish pressure. However, analyst Jason Marks expects a 400% increase should SHIB surpass the $0.00001570 key resistance level. He emphasizes the usually optimistic Inverse Head & Shoulders pattern. If SHIB can reclaim more price levels, it might hit $0.000081, providing notable returns for investors. SHIB remains a powerful community-driven asset that might beat expectations under the correct market conditions. Hyperliquid (HYPE): Whale Accumulation Signals Bullish Momentum Hyperliquid (HYPE) is rapidly gaining traction in the cryptocurrency market, with whale investors aggressively purchasing massive sums of HYPE tokens. According to Lookonchain, three large wallet addresses have together deposited $8.42 million USDC with Hyperliquid to purchase HYPE. The purchase caused a 10% price increase in just 15 hours, with HYPE rising to $19.70 as of writing. Technical indicators remain optimistic. The HYPE RSI rose from 55 to 72, indicating strong purchasing pressure. The MACD also shows a bullish crossover, implying additional upward potential. Hyperliquid (HYPE) is poised to be a top performer in the 2025 bull market, according to expanding trade volume, a burgeoning DeFi ecosystem, and more whale interest. Can XRP Break Out Before the Bull Run? XRP has been among the most solid cryptocurrencies despite continuous legal problems. It trades at $2.20 as of this report. Prominent analyst Egrag Crypto predicts a significant price surge in the following months to $27.50 by late 2025. Technical indicators indicate that XRP is reaching a critical resistance level that, if breached, might result in a breakout. If XRP can hit $7.50, analysts predict it will start a strong bullish phase, making it one of the top altcoins to watch in 2025. Can Aptos (APT) Rally Back to $10? Aptos (APT) is showing signs of a huge breakout, with social sentiment at its highest level since November. Trading around $6.25 as of this writing, APT is at a Point of Inversion (POI), historically serving as a significant recovery level. Aptos' Total Value Locked (TVL) has risen to $977 million, driven by DeFi expansion and institutional adoption. Its stablecoin market capitalization has also reached $837 million, bolstering its position. With Aave V3's recent deployment on Aptos, liquidity has increased, making a move above $7 quite possible. If progress continues, APT may reclaim the $10 level by mid-2025. Why Investors Should Avoid Cardano (ADA) While Cardano (ADA) continues to promise innovation, its slow adoption and price issues make it a dangerous investment in 2025. ADA recently underwent the Plomin hard fork, which allowed ADA holders to vote on protocol improvements. However, the move has not translated into major price action. ADA is trading at $0.68, a 7.4% drop in the last 24 hours. Despite reports of a possible breakout, ADA remains below its key moving averages. Market analyst Dan Gambardello says ADA is poised to undergo a big bullish phase, although its historical price behavior predicts protracted consolidation periods before any significant advance. Furthermore, institutional interest in ADA remains low, and with other altcoins such as Rexas Finance (RXS) and XRP drawing greater liquidity, ADA's chances of outperforming the market are modest. Cardano simply does not meet the criteria for the best altcoins with real potential. The Top Altcoins to Buy Now for the 2025 Bull Run With the 2025 bull run approaching, investors should prioritize high-utility altcoins with outstanding acceptance and growth potential. Rexas Finance, Hyperliquid, Shiba Inu, Aptos, and XRP. Avoid Cardano because of its slow ecosystem expansion, which makes it a dangerous investment by 2025. For those wishing to invest in the best-performing altcoin of 2025, Rexas Finance is the clear choice. With its imminent exchange listing, good fundamentals, and increasing acceptance, now is an excellent opportunity to purchase RXS before the market explodes. To secure RXS tokens before the official launch, go to the Rexas Finance presale now.

The transaction was completed just a day before the official launch of SOL futures on March 17, according to a Sunday press release . FalconX, based in San Mateo, California, executed the trade to facilitate institutional investors’ ability to manage risk and price exposure on a regulated platform. “This trade represents a significant step in providing liquidity and hedging opportunities for institutional clients,” said Josh Barkhordar, head of U.S. sales at FalconX, in a statement. Block Trades Facilitate Large-Scale Transactions Without Market Disruptions Block trades refer to large, privately negotiated transactions executed outside the open market to prevent major price disruptions. These trades are commonly used in derivatives markets to ensure smooth execution for large-volume participants. CME Group introduced Solana futures in late February in response to rising institutional demand for exposure to the asset. The new derivatives are also seen as a potential stepping stone to a Solana exchange-traded fund (ETF), similar to the pathway followed by Bitcoin and Ethereum. Futures markets for both assets played a critical role in the lead-up to spot ETF approvals. Several asset managers have already submitted applications to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch Solana ETFs. Franklin Templeton, managing over $1.5 trillion in assets, filed its application in February 2025. Other firms, including Grayscale, 21Shares, Bitwise, VanEck, and Canary Capital, have also moved to establish spot Solana ETFs. FalconX Executes First-Ever CME Group SOL Futures Trade with StoneX FalconX, a leading digital asset prime broker, today announced that it has executed the first-ever block trade of CME Group's newly launched Solana (SOL) futures product with StoneX, a leading global financial… pic.twitter.com/yeKDBa9dCc — MetaEra (@MetaEraHK) March 17, 2025 CME’s Solana futures contracts come in two sizes: standard contracts representing 500 SOL and micro contracts covering 25 SOL. The contracts are cash-settled based on the CME CF Solana-Dollar Reference Rate, which is calculated daily at 4:00 p.m. London time. This pricing mechanism provides a transparent benchmark for SOL’s value in U.S. dollars. FalconX remains a key liquidity provider in CME’s crypto derivatives ecosystem. The company reports having executed over $1.5 trillion in trading volume across more than 400 tokens for around 600 institutional clients. It has also expanded its institutional presence through acquisitions and partnerships. FalconX Expands Institutional Presence In January 2025, FalconX acquired derivatives trading firm Arbelos Markets , followed by a partnership with TP ICAP’s Fusion Digital Assets in February 2024. Last year, the firm also unveiled a prime brokerage service designed to facilitate institutional investors’ trading activities on exchanges while their funds remain securely held in regulated, bankruptcy-remote custody. Meanwhile, CME Group reports continued growth in its crypto derivatives market. The average daily volume for crypto contracts reached 202,000 in early 2025, marking a 73% increase year-over-year. Open interest has also surged, with 243,600 contracts recorded—up 55% from the previous year. More than 11,300 unique accounts are actively trading CME’s crypto products. On centralized crypto exchanges, Solana derivatives have seen a sharp rise in trading activity, with volumes surging 66% to $7.24 billion, according to Coinglass. Despite this, the asset remains under pressure, trading at $127, down 6.4% on the day, following its January high near $293.31, as per CoinGecko data.

Internet Computer protocol price forecast for 2028 expects the token to reach a peak price of $36.8. By 2031, ICP’s price might reach a maximum price of $113.32. Internet Computer (ICP) is a groundbreaking blockchain network developed by the DFINITY Foundation. It aims to extend the functionality of the internet, enabling it to host backend software and transforming it into a global, decentralized computer. The network leverages advanced cryptography and innovative technology to provide scalable, efficient, and secure decentralized applications (dApps). Given its robust technology and expanding utility, the Internet Computer blockchain’s future price prospects look promising. As more developers build on the platform and adoption increases, ICP token demand will likely rise. Does Internet Computer coin have a future? How much will Internet Computer coin cost in 2025? Will ICP reach $1000? Let’s get into the current price analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Internet Computer Token ICP Price $5.74 Market Cap $2,773,918,920.1 Trading Volume $58,940,067.47 Circulating Supply 481,744,258.02 ICP All-time High $750.73 May 10, 2021 24-h High $5.76 24-h Low $5.52 Internet Computer technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 9.41% 50-Day SMA $7.00 14-Day RSI 39.57 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 32 (Extreme Fear) Green Days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $8.93 Internet Computer price analysis: ICP signals rebound potential, eyes key resistance for recovery TL;DR Breakdown ICP’s price analysis shows some gains. Resistance levels to watch are $5.868 and $5.922. ICP 1-day price analysis: ICP shows signs of recovery, but volume indicator is bearish The ICP/USDT chart for March 17 shows a recent uptrend, suggesting a potential rebound and push towards $5.922. The price is below the 20-day SMA ($5.992) but might soon recapture that level. ICP shows signs of recovery, but volume indicator is bearish The MACD supports the bullish turn, with green histograms emerging. The OBV indicator shows a downtrend, indicating declining volume during recent price moves. This suggests the bullish price action may lack the necessary volume support to sustain upward momentum. ICP price analysis for 4-hour: ICP is slightly bullish, with weak buying pressure The 4-hour ICP/USDT chart shows the price at $5.757 above the middle Bollinger Band, indicating a potential short-term push towards $5.868. The RSI is at 55.72, suggesting a neutral market and the possibility for range-bound movement. ICP is slightly bullish, with weak buying pressure A slightly positive CMF (0.02) reflects mild cash inflow. While the CMF is slightly bullish, it’s relatively weak, indicating that the buying pressure is not particularly strong. A break above $5.868 resistance is needed to solidify the uptrend. ICP technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $7.36 SELL SMA 5 $6.68 SELL SMA 10 $6.48 SELL SMA 21 $6.33 SELL SMA 50 $7.00 SELL SMA 100 $8.95 SELL SMA 200 $8.93 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $6.35 SELL EMA 5 $6.96 SELL EMA 10 $8.08 SELL EMA 21 $9.29 SELL EMA 50 $10.19 SELL EMA 100 $10.11 SELL EMA 200 $9.89 SELL What to expect from ICP price analysis ICP is in the gains, but consolidation could follow next. A breakout above $5.9–$6.0 could lead to further gains, while a rejection may bring a pullback to lower support levels. Weak CMF and neutral RSI suggest caution, as momentum lacks confirmation. Is Internet Computer a good investment? The Internet Computer (ICP) has shown significant potential and volatility since its launch, which is common for relatively new and ambitious blockchain projects.

Bitcoin has underperformed gold and the S&P 500 in 2025, but its long-term uptrend and technical support suggest a potential rebound. IBIT offers a convenient way to gain bitcoin exposure with low fees and high liquidity, making it a strong investment option. Seasonal trends and technical analysis indicate a favorable period for bitcoin, with potential gains through April and May. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) strategists might have some tweaking to do. The price of the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency is down 9% so far in 2025 after hitting an all-time high right around the time President Trump was sworn into office. By contrast, gold has rallied almost 14%, briefly eclipsing the $3000 mark for the first time last Friday. The S&P 500, meanwhile, has lost 4% year to date. In Q4 2024, I put out a bullish note on bitcoin. It went on to rally sharply in late December and January, before pulling back in the past two-plus months. Since my buy rating on the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ), the fund has lost 8.8%, about twice the decline of the S&P 500 ETF Trust ( SPY ). I reiterate a buy rating on IBIT, though, as I see key support now in play on the chart as gold has turned stretched in valuation compared to bitcoin. What’s more, we are in a bullish calendar stretch for the digital asset. YTD Returns: Bitcoin Loses Ground to Gold & SPX Stockcharts.com Bitcoin Year-End 2025 Price Targets are High Author Bitcoin Middle of the Pack in 2025 So Far Goldman Sachs According to the issuer , IBIT seeks to reflect generally the performance of the price of bitcoin. The ETF enables investors to get exposure to bitcoin through the convenience of an exchange-traded product, helping remove the operational, tax, and custody complexities of holding bitcoin directly. IBIT has been the most traded bitcoin exchange-traded product since its launch, providing investors with potentially lower transaction costs. It’s a large ETF with more than $48 billion in assets under management as of March 14, 2025. IBIT’s annual expense ratio is low at 25 basis points, and it does not pay a dividend . Share-price momentum is graded as strong by Seeking Alpha’s quantitative scoring system, but I’ll point out that a correction is ongoing, with bitcoin briefly dipping into bear-market territory in the last two weeks. With very high volatility, IBIT sports a weak F ETF Grade on Risk , but its liquidity rating is healthy given average daily volume of almost 50 million shares and a 30-day median bid/ask spread of only two basis points, per iShares. I’d call out that gold’s rapid ascent in the past handful of months has not come alongside a comparable bitcoin advance. The total crypto market cap is back under $3 trillion, while the market value of gold rose above $20 trillion. The $20 trillion to $3 trillion ratio is a key spot—the second chart below illustrates that the bitcoin price to gold price is at a key technical point, auguring for a bitcoin bounce or a gold dip. I lean toward the former as being more likely given its long-term uptrend. Gold & Bitcoin Market Caps Coinmarketcap Bitcoin vs Gold: Key Trendline Support Stockcharts.com Today also presents an opportunity for investors to buy the dip in IBIT. The ETF has fallen in line with many of the Magnificent Seven stocks . I also published a long play on the Magnificent Seven ETF ( MAGS ) earlier this year, which could apply to IBIT’s price action lately too. Magnificent Drawdowns Koyfin Charts What didn’t work out so well for bitcoin and IBIT holders was the news earlier this month that President Trump looked to create a bitcoin reserve. It being formally put in place is now seen with just a 52% chance by the start of 2026. It remains to be seen if the federal government would fund it with new bitcoin purchases or simply what it has already confiscated from wrongdoers. Bitcoin Reserve Chance Has Retreated Kalshi Seasonally, bitcoin tends to rally now through July. While February was its worst month since June 2022, bitcoin is marginally positive in March, and the April-May stretch has been particularly strong since 2011. Even since 2014, the crypto token has averaged a 7.8% April gain and an 11.5% May advance. Bitcoin: Bullish Calendar Trends Barchart The Technical Take With bitcoin well off its all-time high and as we progress through a bullish calendar period, bitcoin’s technical chart is mixed but encouraging. Notice in the graph below that BTC USD retraced 38.2% of its late 2022 to January 2025 rally, meeting buyers near the March 2024 previous peak. In December, I called out that a retest to $74,000 was possible if it fell below $90,000, and that transpired, much to IBIT holders’ (including myself) chagrin. A new pattern is a bearish rounded top that triggered a downside measured move price objective to $69,000 a few weeks ago. While that could happen, that would be a great buying opportunity, in my view, since there is a high amount of volume by price that enters the scene there. After notching technical oversold conditions and in the wake of printing a bearish RSI momentum divergence, the bears have some control of the trend, but the long-term 200-day moving average remains on the rise. I’d like to see bitcoin rally through, and hold above, the 200dma to sustain the uptrend. Bitcoin: Holding Key Support From Early 2024, $90,000 New Resistance Stockcharts.com The Bottom Line I have a buy rating on IBIT. Long the fund myself, I see the downside test earlier this month as healthy to sustain a long-term uptrend.",BTC-USD|IBIT,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|FIAT|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-03-17 10:10:29

Meanwhile, Telegram founder Pavel Durov was granted permission to leave France after months of legal trouble, with supporters framing his case as a battle for free speech. In the UK, Bitcoin investor James Howells suffered yet another legal defeat in his bid to recover a lost hard drive containing 8,000 BTC, as courts rejected his landfill excavation request. With Bitcoin now above $83,000, his holdings are worth over $660 million, but time is running out as the landfill is set to close soon. Marla Maples Backs Roger Ver Marla Maples, the second ex-wife of US President Donald Trump, publicly voiced her support for dismissing the charges against early Bitcoin advocate Roger Ver, who is also known as ”Bitcoin Jesus.” In a March 16 post on X , Maples shared a video from an organization backing Ver’s cause and tagged Trump, Elon Musk, and US Attorney General Pam Bondi, in a call to end his prosecution. Ver was indicted by the US Department of Justice in April of 2024 on charges of mail fraud, tax evasion, and filing false tax returns. Authorities claim he concealed his Bitcoin holdings when renouncing his US citizenship in 2014 and defrauded the IRS out of $48 million by failing to disclose profits from Bitcoin sales. He was arrested in Spain after the indictment, and was later granted bail under the condition that he remain in the country. Maples was married to Trump from 1993 to 1999 and shares a daughter, Tiffany Trump, and has remained publicly supportive of the president. She attended Trump’s inauguration and is more than willing to contribute to his political efforts in any way possible. Her stance on Ver is also very similar to that of other high-profile figures, including Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and Silk Road creator Ross Ulbricht, who was serving a double life sentence before receiving a pardon from Trump in January. Ver has petitioned Trump for a pardon, and claims that he is being unfairly targeted and is a victim of ”lawfare.” However, there has been no public response from Trump or the White House regarding his request. Meanwhile, Elon Musk dismissed the idea of a pardon in a January X post by stating that Ver “gave up his US citizenship” and that ”membership has its privileges.” In December, Ver filed a motion to dismiss the case, and argued that the charges were unconstitutional and that the IRS' ”exit tax” for renounced citizens is ambiguous when applied to cryptocurrency. Pavel Durov Leaves France Meanwhile, The Open Network (TON) Society hailed the return of Pavel Durov’s passport as a victory for free speech, online privacy, and technological innovation. Durov is the founder of Telegram, and was allowed to leave France for Dubai on March 15 after receiving official permission from French authorities. The TON Society has been very vocal in its support since his arrest on Aug. 24 of last year, and held firm that his detention was a direct attack on fundamental human rights. (Source: TON Society ) The organization previously condemned the French government’s actions in an open letter, and called on global institutions like the United Nations, the Council of Europe, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and the European Union to intervene. The group placed a lot of emphasis on the fact that Durov’s steadfast commitment to freedom of speech, even under immense personal and political pressure, served as a reminder of the importance of upholding core principles despite adversity. The arrest caused a lot of concerns in the crypto industry, particularly among privacy advocates and supporters of decentralized technologies. Many saw the situation as a warning about the growing pressure from state authorities to regulate and censor online platforms. Chris Pavlovski, CEO of the free-speech video platform Rumble, revealed that he quickly left Europe after Durov’s detention due to threats from the French government against his company. During the backlash, French President Emmanuel Macron denied that Durov’s arrest was politically motivated. He also rejected claims that he personally invited Durov to France before the incident. Despite these assurances, many people in the crypto and free speech communities are still very skeptical, and see the arrest as part of a broader struggle between decentralized platforms and state-controlled regulatory measures. James Howells’ Bitcoin Recovery Appeal Denied Roger Ver and Pavel Durov are not the only ones with their hands full legally. A UK man’s long-running battle to recover a lost hard drive containing 8,000 Bitcoin suffered yet another setback after the UK Court of Appeal rejected his bid for a permit to search a landfill. James Howells shared the news on March 14, and is very frustrated with what he called “The Great British Injustice System.” After the court’s decision, Howells announced his plan to take his case to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), and argued that his right to property and a fair trial had been violated. The latest rejection came from Judge Christopher Nugee, who ruled that Howells' appeal had no “real prospect of success” and that there was no compelling reason to hear the case. This followed a similar decision in January by High Court Judge Andrew Keyser, who dismissed the case on the same grounds. Despite these rulings, Howells is still very determined to fight for the right to search the Newport landfill. James Howells is a British IT worker who is best known for accidentally discarding a hard drive containing 8,000 Bitcoin in 2013. The hard drive ended up in a landfill in Newport, Wales, and its current estimated value is in the hundreds of millions of dollars. After realizing his mistake, Howells spent years trying to recover the lost Bitcoin by proposing large-scale excavation projects to search for the drive. However, local authorities have repeatedly denied him permission to dig up the landfill, and his story is one of the most famous cases of lost cryptocurrency wealth. James Howell With Bitcoin now trading above $83,000, his lost holdings are worth approximately $660 million, making it one of the most valuable misplaced crypto fortunes in history. While few anticipated Bitcoin’s meteoric rise at the time of his loss, Howells' situation proves just how important it is to securely manage self-custodied digital assets. The clock is ticking on his legal options, and reports indicate that the landfill is set to close during the UK’s 2025-2026 financial year. Although the ECHR cannot overturn UK court rulings, a favorable decision could push the courts to reconsider their stance. Howells has vowed not to give up, and insisted that he will continue his fight “no matter how long it takes.”",News|Legal,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|TON|ETH|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-17 10:10:56
41805899,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=140630,1742211039,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Insightful Take: CZ Binance on Why AI Agents Don’t Need Their Own Crypto Tokens (Yet),https://bitcoinworld.co.in/cz-binance-ai-tokens-utility/,"In a landscape buzzing with innovation and speculation, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) has dropped a nugget of wisdom that’s got the crypto and AI communities talking. Forget the hype for a moment, and let’s dive into why CZ believes AI agents , the intelligent algorithms designed to automate tasks and make decisions, might not need their own dedicated tokens – at least, not right away. This isn’t just another tweet; it’s a fundamental perspective shift that could reshape how we think about the intersection of artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. Why CZ Binance Thinks Utility Should Come Before AI Tokens CZ’s recent statement on X (formerly Twitter) is clear: AI agents can leverage existing cryptocurrencies for their operations. Think about it – these agents are built to provide services, automate processes, and enhance efficiency. Why complicate things by immediately launching a new token? CZ emphasizes a principle of ‘utility first.’ Let’s break down his core argument: Focus on Functionality: The primary goal of AI agents should be to deliver value and solve problems. Creating a token distracts from this core mission, diverting resources and attention towards tokenomics, distribution, and market making. Leverage Existing Crypto Infrastructure: The crypto world already boasts a robust infrastructure of established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins. AI agents can seamlessly integrate with these existing systems to facilitate transactions and access financial services. Scalability and Maturity: Token creation should be considered when an AI agent platform achieves significant scale and demonstrates clear, sustained utility. Premature token launches can lead to speculative bubbles and hinder long-term growth. Avoid Unnecessary Complexity: Launching a token adds layers of complexity – tokenomics design, security audits, exchange listings, community management. For nascent AI agents , this can be an unnecessary burden. The Benefits of Prioritizing Utility for Crypto AI Projects CZ’s perspective isn’t just about avoiding complexity; it highlights significant benefits for the Crypto AI space. By focusing on utility before tokenization, projects can: Faster Development and Deployment: Without the overhead of token development, teams can concentrate on building and refining their AI agents and their core functionalities. This can lead to quicker innovation and faster market entry. Stronger Focus on Real-World Applications: A utility-first approach encourages developers to create AI agents that solve tangible problems. This real-world application focus is crucial for long-term adoption and sustainability. Reduced Speculative Risk: Delaying tokenization can mitigate the risks associated with speculative token launches. It allows projects to build a solid foundation based on genuine utility before introducing a token that might be subject to market volatility. Attracting Long-Term Investors: Investors who are serious about the Crypto AI space are increasingly looking for projects with solid fundamentals and real-world use cases. A utility-focused approach can attract these long-term, value-driven investors. Navigating the Challenges: When Might AI Agents Need Tokens? While CZ’s stance is compelling, it’s important to consider scenarios where AI tokens might become necessary or beneficial. Let’s explore some potential situations: Scenario Rationale for a Token Decentralized Governance: If an AI agent network aims for true decentralization, a governance token can empower the community to participate in decision-making, upgrades, and resource allocation. Incentivizing Network Participation: For complex AI agent networks requiring distributed computing, data contribution, or specialized services, a token can incentivize participation and reward contributors. Complex Economic Models: When AI agents operate within intricate ecosystems involving micropayments, data markets, or decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), a dedicated token might be needed to facilitate these complex economic interactions. Funding and Growth: Once an AI agent platform has proven its utility and reached a significant user base, a token launch can be a strategic move for fundraising, scaling operations, and further development. Examples of Crypto AI Projects and Token Strategies Looking at the current landscape, we see a mix of approaches in the Crypto AI space. Some projects have launched tokens early on, while others are prioritizing utility first. Here are a few examples to consider: SingularityNET (AGI): SingularityNET is a decentralized AI marketplace that uses its AGI token for transactions within its ecosystem. They launched their token early to bootstrap their network and incentivize AI service providers. Fetch.ai (FET): Fetch.ai focuses on building an open-access, decentralized machine learning network. Their FET token is used for network access, agent deployment, and staking. Ocean Protocol (OCEAN): Ocean Protocol enables the sharing and monetization of data. Their OCEAN token facilitates data transactions and governance within their data marketplace. Projects Without Native Tokens (Yet): Many Crypto AI initiatives are currently building their platforms and demonstrating utility before considering tokenization. This approach aligns with CZ’s perspective, emphasizing a solid foundation before introducing a token. Actionable Insights for AI Agents and Crypto Enthusiasts So, what does CZ’s perspective mean for you, whether you’re a developer, investor, or simply interested in the future of Crypto AI ? For Developers: Focus on building robust, useful AI agents first. Prove the utility and value proposition before even thinking about launching a token.

Though it was founded in 2017 by Anatomy Yakovenko alongwith Raj Gokal under the brand name of Solana Labs, its Mainnet was launched in 2020, pioneering the Proof-of-History (PoH) concept. Five years ago, Anatoly Yakovenko, a former Qualcomm engineer, entered the Blockchain space and presented Solana with an ambitious goal: to build a high-speed, low-cost, and scalable network that could rival traditional financial systems. And cut to today’s March 2025, it boasts of enabling 408 billion transactions with nearly $987B DEX Volume, supported by 1300+ validators. In its 5-year journey of becoming the industry’s leading Layer-1 Blockchain, it has faced several breakdowns and breakthroughs. Snapshot from Anatoly Yakovenko’s 2017 WhitePaper on Solana: A new architecture for a high performance blockchain v0.8.13 Join BrandTalk as we revisit the defining moments that have left a lasting mark on Solana’s incredible 5-year journey. 1. Solana’s $20M Funding from Multicoin Capital Its journey particularly received a green light when in July 2019, Solana received $20 Million in funding, led by Multicoin Capital. Multicoin Capital was one of the earliest and most influential investors in Solana. The venture capital firm, known for backing high-growth blockchain projects, recognized Solana’s potential early and played a key role in its rise. “When you find someone who has already written code that will run on billions of phones and optimize transaction speed—this (investment) is obvious,” Multicoin Capital general partner Vinny Lingham had said during that time of the investment. Kyle Samani, co-founder and managing partner of Multicoin Capital, on investment in Solana in his recent article. However, later Multicoin Capital was heavily exposed to FTX and Alameda Research, both of which were deeply intertwined with Solana. When FTX collapsed in November 2022, SOL’s price plunged, and Multicoin too suffered major losses. Despite this, they remained committed to Solana, citing its strong developer ecosystem and technology. Notably, Multicoin Capital still views Solana as a key investment, emphasizing its high throughput, low fees, and growing adoption in DeFi, NFTs, and payments. They continue to hold a substantial amount of SOL and have re-affirmed their long-term belief in the network. 2. Network Instability with recurrent outages Unlike Ethereum’s Layer 2 scaling solutions, Solana processes all transactions on a single layer, making it vulnerable to spikes in demand – a feature that proved both boon and bane for Solana. With High TPS & Bot Activity, its cheap fees attracted bots that flood the network with spam transactions, overwhelming validators – creating its history of network outages. Since its launch, the blockchain suffered multiple downtimes, including a 17-hour outage in September 2021 due to excessive transaction load. While the team worked to improve network resilience, critics questioned its reliability as a decentralized system. In May, 2022 again, it suffered 7-Hour Outage due to NFT minting bots flooding the network with over 4 million transactions per second. As a result, Solana halted and required a manual restart. It suffered another such outrage in October with its most recent being on February 25, 2023 – 20-Hour Degradation. In order to solve it, in August 2022, Solana collaborated with Jump Crypto to develop Firedancer, a new validator client aimed at enhancing network efficiency and reducing downtime. 3. Hailed as a potential “Ethereum killer” Solana earned the title of “Ethereum killer” due to its high throughput, low transaction costs, and developer-friendly ecosystem. It was seen as a strong competitor to Ethereum, addressing its scalability and congestion issues. Further, Solana’s high-speed blockchain came as a game-changer for DeFi, NFTs, and gaming, making transactions nearly instantaneous compared to Ethereum’s slower confirmations.its scalability and congestion issues. 3. FTX Collapse Came as a Major Setback Its narrative of being a “Ethereum Killer” received significant setback during Sam Bankman Fried-led FTX Collapse of November 2022, coming as the biggest challenge for Solana when FTX and Alameda Research collapsed. As a major investor in Solana, Alameda held significant SOL tokens, and its bankruptcy sent shockwaves through the ecosystem. Solana’s total value locked (TVL) in DeFi dropped from over $10 billion to under $500 million, and its price plummeted by more than 90% from its all-time high of $260. Many assumed that Solana would struggle to recover, but the community and developers remained steadfast. Solana and the FTX Collapse 4. (SOL) reaching ATH price of $259.96 with NFT and DeFi Boom Solana (SOL) reached its all-time high (ATH) price of $259.96 on November 6, 2021, during the peak of the 2021 crypto bull run. And in November 2024, Solana (SOL) broke its previous record to reach a new all-time high above $264, fueled by a prolonged market rally and optimism following Donald Trump’s re-election as US president. SOL ATH price of $259.96 in Nov 2021 The success of Solana-based NFT projects like Degenerate Ape Academy and the rise of Magic Eden (a leading Solana NFT marketplace) brought massive demand to the ecosystem. On the DeFi front, Serum DEX, Jupiter Aggregator, Raydium, and Marinade Finance have driven Solana’s resurgence. Solana’s DeFi TVL surpassed $3 billion by early 2024, proving that it was more than just a speculative asset Solana’s NFT ecosystem has also exploded, with marketplaces like Magic Eden and Tensor rivaling Ethereum’s OpenSea. Notably, the Mad Lads collection became a breakout success, reinforcing Solana’s dominance in the NFT space.. 5. Memecoin Supported momentum with $BONK and $WIF Solana found unexpected momentum through memecoins, particularly BONK and DogWifHat (WIF). BONK’s airdrop in late 2022 revived interest in Solana, while WIF’s meteoric rise in 2024 turned it into one of the top-performing tokens. These events demonstrated Solana’s ability to capture viral trends and engage retail traders. 6. Launch of Solana Mobile for Bringing Web3 to Phones Its boldest move was in year 2023 with Solana Mobile, which introduced the Saga phone—a Web3-native smartphone enabling seamless crypto transactions and NFT minting. The Chapter 2 mobile device, announced in 2024, promises to expand this vision, positioning Solana as a leader in mobile blockchain. Source: https://coingape.com/solana-mobile-phone-saga-takes-next-step-opens-access-to-the-public/ Solana vs. Ethereum, BNB, and L2s: The Competition Is Fiercer Than Ever! Solana has positioned itself as an alternative to Ethereum and BNB Chain, competing on speed, cost, and user experience. However, Ethereum’s Layer 2 networks (Arbitrum, Optimism) have narrowed the gap by improving Ethereum’s scalability. Meanwhile, BNB Chain’s recent dominance in DEX trading volume has also shown that competition in DeFi is heating up. On Sunday, BNB Chain’s DEX trading volume reached an unprecedented $1.64 billion, surpassing Solana’s $1.077 billion during the same period. This surge represents a 13% increase over the past week for BNB Chain, while Solana experienced a 28% decline in DEX trading volume. Thus, the challenge for Solana is to maintain its unique value proposition—high-speed transactions with low fees—while ensuring network reliability. What’s Next for Solana Now? As it enters its fifth year, the roadmap ahead looks promising: 1. Firedancer Implementation to fight network outages: The full release of Firedancer is anticipated in 2025, with ongoing testing and development to ensure its robustness and effectiveness in enhancing Solana’s network stability. 2. Doubling Blockspace: Anza, Solana’s main software development team, has unveiled a 2025 roadmap aiming to double the network’s blockspace. This initiative seeks to enhance transaction throughput, accommodating a growing number of decentralized applications (dApps) and users. 3. Efficiency Improvements: The roadmap includes micro-advancements such as optimizing Agave’s scheduler, scaling the Turbine protocol, and adopting a faster hashing algorithm. These enhancements are designed to improve transaction handling and overall network performance. 4. Overhauling the Read Layer: Recognizing the need for better data accessibility, the Solana Foundation plans to revamp the network’s read layer. A Blockchain That Refused to Die? Solana’s journey from network outages and the FTX collapse to a vibrant DeFi, NFT, and memecoin ecosystem is one of the most dramatic comeback stories in crypto. While challenges remain, it has proven that innovation, a strong community, and a relentless focus on scalability and speed can drive long-term success. As the blockchain industry evolves, one thing is certain: Solana is here to stay, with many more anniversaries and milestones to celebrate.

41806160,https://zycrypto.com/?p=103750,1742211444,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,Goldman Sachs Mentions “Digital Assets” for First Time in Annual Report,https://zycrypto.com/goldman-sachs-mentions-digital-assets-for-first-time-in-annual-report/,"Goldman Sachs , a renowned Wall Street investment bank, despite avoiding crypto in its reports since 2017, wrote in its 2024 annual report that cryptocurrencies were now a force within the financial markets. “The growth of electronic trading,” wrote Goldman Sachs, “and the introduction of new products and technologies, including trading and distributed ledger technologies, such as cryptocurrencies and AI technologies, has increased competition.” The bank did not mention crypto from 2017 to 2023 until this year. There have been many reasons for the bank to consider Bitcoin, from market conditions beating previous highs to the announcement of Bitcoin ETFs and Trump’s pro-crypto administration. Given recent events, it would be difficult for the investment bank to remain silent on crypto. “We also compete”, wrote Goldman Sachs, “on the basis of the types of financial products and client experiences that we and our competitors offer. In some circumstances, our competitors may offer financial products that we do not offer and that our clients may prefer, including cryptocurrencies and other digital assets that we cannot or may choose not to provide”. The annual report suggests Goldman Sachs is losing customers to banks that offer more crypto services. The bank has started to invest in crypto assets but remains cautious about digital assets like Bitcoin. In 2021, Goldman Sachs introduced a crypto trading desk ; in 2022, it introduced a digital assets platform. In 2024, Goldman Sachs raised its crypto ETF holdings from $744 million in the third quarter to $2.05 billion in the fourth quarter. The bank also increased its Bitcoin ETF holdings by 15%. The bank has taken an interest in the blockchain industry, being one of the few banks to invest in the Canton network, using blockchain technology to improve financial record keeping. The 2024 annual report for Goldman Sachs showed positive results with a Return on Equity (ROE) of 12.7%. Earnings per share jumped by 77%. And shareholder return soared by 52%. With a strong annual report, Goldman Sachs offered cautionary words concerning crypto: “Although the prevalence and scope of applications of distributed ledger technology, cryptocurrency, and similar technologies are growing, the technology is nascent and may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks or have other inherent weaknesses.” However, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reported that Goldman Sachs has a substantial holding in Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, exceeding $1 billion in assets, showing a strong desire by the investment bank to embrace digital assets. This cannot be an accident or some side project because, despite the criticism of crypto, Goldman Sachs has taken a substantial holding in the asset, suggesting that they are taking crypto’s popularity and widespread adoption seriously. Investors may be more interested in crypto after a large bank like Goldman Sachs makes a substantial investment. The bank is less likely to make impulsive decisions and will hold onto the asset for a longer period, adding to accumulated funds rather than making risky short-term gains. Other institutional buyers may ride the coattails of Goodman Sachs and further deplete the finite amount of Bitcoin in the market, further boosting the prices and promoting crypto amongst the investment community. Most of Goldman Sachs’s crypto holdings were in Bitcoin and a lesser amount in Ethereum. Most of its Bitcoin holdings are in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), with Goldman Sachs owning 24 million shares. The investment includes Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust (FBTC) and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). Goldman Sachs’ increased interest in crypto, as evidenced by their mention of the digital asset in their recent annual report, shows a positive trend amongst traditional investors. Bitcoin is often viewed as analogous to gold, a store of value to hedge against market volatility. Ethereum provides access to Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and other blockchain applications. As the market matures and survives short-term bubbles, more and more investors may take a long-term interest in the new asset. Wall Street financial institutions like Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon are some of the largest traditional investors in Bitcoin. While purchasing billions in the asset, Goldman Sachs cautions investors about cryptocurrency, suggesting that the company may already be serious about Bitcoin while carefully introducing the crypto market to uninformed or even skeptical investors.",Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News|Goldman Sachs,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-17 11:37:24

In a press conference held on Mar. 17, Wemix Foundation ( WEMIX ) CEO Kim Seok-hwan addressed the delayed announcement of the recent security breach and announced full services resumption on 21 March, as initially reported by Business Korea . The incident in question occurred on Feb. 28 and involved a security breach of the Wemix Foundation’s “Play Bridge Vault” crypto wallet, which transfers WEMIX to other blockchains. Around 8.6 million WEMIX tokens were withdrawn, worth around $6.04 million (8.75 billion won). Following the hack , the affected server was shut down immediately, and the company reported it to the Cyber Investigation Team of the Seoul National Police Agency. Although the incident was noted on Feb. 28, Wemix Foundation didn’t report it until Mar. 4, sparking public backlash. In the press conference today, Wemix Foundation CEO Kim Seok-hwan addressed the late announcement, explaining that it had been delayed due to concerns about additional attacks and to avoid panic selling. This is not the first time Wemix Foundation was criticized for issues with information disclosure. In October 2022, Digital Asset Exchange Joint Consultative Body has warned investors to exercise caution with WEMIX due issues with disclosing WEMIX circulation volume .

Durov said the process is still ongoing but added that it “feels great to be home.” The post follows reports that the Telegram founder was allowed to leave France and return home. On March 15, a report citing anonymous sources said the executive had departed from France after getting approval from a French court to leave the country . Durov was arrested in Paris on Aug. 24 as part of an investigation into the instant messaging app. The executive was accused of running a platform that allowed illegal activities.

The call-to-put open interest ratio is one way to ascertain whether the market is bullish. The call open interest stood at roughly 11,800 contracts, while the put open interest stood at approximately 8,500 contracts. This means that more traders are betting on Bitcoin’s price rise. A concentration of put contracts at the $75k to $85k level may indicate hedging behaviors, which could result in higher volatility and further price drops. The hedging behavior is a cause for concern because Bitcoin could take many different turns. Traders may not have a clear target at this point, prolonging a sideways action, or if Bitcoin fails to break above $90k, the price may suffer more lows shortly. Traders would be, for the most part, waiting for a breakout in either direction. The Bitcoin basis rate, the premium of monthly contracts over spot markets, is in healthy territory after briefly signaling bearish sentiment. The current basis rate is 5%, lower than the 8% recorded earlier. However, the 5% to 10% range is generally accepted as bullish territory, as a premium to compensate for more extended periods of waiting for a trade. The drop from 8% to 5% could be a neutral signal, suggesting a sideways action. With the derivatives market showing signs of a bullish recovery, traders will be watching for key levels indicating recovery, particularly with resistance and support levels. Bitcoin margin markets can supplement an analysis of Bitcoin derivatives. Margins allow traders to borrow stablecoins to buy Bitcoin. Also, traders can borrow Bitcoin to buy stablecoins, thus shorting the price. Derivatives, on the other hand, always have a balance between longs and shorts. The Bitcoin long-to-short ratio on OKX shows longs outweighing shorts by 18x. Typically, a ratio above 40 means overconfidence, whereas under 5 means bearish territory. Federal reserves from developed countries financed their treasuries during the pandemic, post-lockdown, injecting some of the largest amounts of fiat money since the subprime crisis. The current state of Bitcoin is partly a result of this increase in fiat currency and the aftereffects of inflation. As a result, interest rates increased to control inflation. In 2024, with inflation showing signs of weakening, interest rates were lowered once again. Bitcoin’s rally occurred over fears about America’s trade war policy and potential deep disturbances to global markets. Retaliatory measures by Canada and China only fuelled Bitcoin’s rise because traders were hedging against further price volatility. Moreover, this week’s inflation data only strengthened traders’ expectations of a rate cut because Core CPI slowed to 3.2% while CPI data showed only a 0.3% rise over February. These moderating effects indicate a possible rate cut in June if inflation continues to soften. Derivatives traders have likely already priced in the strong likelihood of a rate cut in June and have reason to expect a bullish Bitcoin run. However, if inflation strengthens, Bitcoin may suffer further drops to lower levels. Next week’s Federal Reserve meeting will be a key driver for Bitcoin traders, who will pay attention to Powell’s comments on the prospects of monetary policy. If there is an indication of a rate cut, Bitcoin traders may seize the opportunity to buy the token at a discount. However, if there is less confidence in a rate cut, traders may see this as a sign of a sideways movement until the reserve signals better prospects.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|FIAT|ASIA,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-17 11:39:43

A recent survey dives deep into their sentiments, revealing a mix of caution and optimism. While short-term market predictions show increased bearishness, a significant portion of Korean investors are placing their hopes on the U.S. SEC’s upcoming crypto regulation roundtables. Let’s unpack the key findings and understand what these insights mean for the broader crypto landscape. Korean Crypto Investors: Navigating Market Volatility Conducted by Bitcoin World and Cratos between March 11th and 14th, the latest weekly survey offers a fascinating glimpse into the prevailing mood among Korean crypto investors . The survey highlights a notable shift in short-term Bitcoin price prediction . This week, 27.8% of respondents anticipate an increase or significant jump in Bitcoin’s value, marking a decrease from 34.2% the previous week. Conversely, the percentage expecting a market decline or sharp drop has risen to 40.0%, up from 29.4% last week. A stable market is predicted by 32.2%, down from 36.4%. Decoding Crypto Market Sentiment: Fear vs. Optimism Beyond immediate price predictions, the survey delved into the overall crypto market sentiment . A significant 41.8% of participants expressed feelings of fear or extreme fear, reflecting anxieties that could be tied to broader economic uncertainties, regulatory pressures, or recent market corrections. However, it’s not all gloom. A substantial 39.0% of respondents maintain a neutral stance, suggesting a wait-and-see approach, while 19.2% express optimism or extreme optimism, indicating a resilient belief in the long-term potential of cryptocurrencies. Are SEC Crypto Roundtables a Ray of Hope? One of the most intriguing aspects of the survey is the Korean investors’ perspective on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) upcoming series of SEC crypto roundtables focused on crypto regulation . A noteworthy 43.5% of respondents view these discussions positively. This significant portion believes that these roundtables will be instrumental in establishing clear and much-needed standards for crypto regulation . The anticipation is that clarity from regulators could pave the way for more stable and predictable market conditions, fostering growth and innovation in the crypto space. However, not everyone shares this optimistic view regarding SEC crypto roundtables . A considerable 37.8% anticipate potential negative outcomes. This segment likely harbors concerns that stricter regulations, influenced by officials who may be skeptical of cryptocurrency, could stifle innovation or impose overly burdensome compliance requirements.

I’ve been in crypto long enough to spot the real winners, and right now, Dawgz AI is leading the market with its explosive growth and AI-powered momentum. But if you're wondering what is XRP price prediction 2025, or where it could go by 2028 and 2030, we’ll break it all down. Will XRP finally take off? Let’s dive in. XRP Price Prediction 2025 Launched in 2012, XRP is a digital asset designed for fast, low-cost transactions. Unlike Bitcoin, it doesn’t rely on mining, making it more energy-efficient. XRP runs on the XRP Ledger, a decentralized network that processes thousands of transactions per second. Its goal? To revolutionize cross-border payments. But XRP’s growth depends heavily on regulatory clarity. Ripple, the company behind XRP, has been battling legal issues with the SEC for years. A favorable outcome could send XRP’s price soaring, while uncertainty could slow its momentum. Analysts predict that XRP could trade between $2.30 and $4.20, with an average price of $3.05. That’s a potential 80.11% ROI from today’s levels. XRP Price Prediction 2025 Table Month Min. Price Avg. Price Max.

If regulatory clarity is achieved, we might finally see XRP break through major resistance levels. Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2028 The crypto market moves fast, and by 2028, Ripple XRP could be in a very different position. So, where is the price of XRP headed in 2028? Analysts project a trading range between $2.27 and $5.31, with an average price of $2.71. Ripple XRP Price Chart for 2028 Month Min. Price Avg. Price Max.

However, with stiff competition in the crypto market, investors should keep a close eye on its next moves. ​​ XRP Predictions 2030 By 2030, XRP holders could finally see the long-term potential of their investment. Over the years, XRP has remained one of the biggest names in crypto, surviving market crashes, lawsuits, and industry shifts. Right now, the current price of XRP is far from its all-time highs. But analysts predict that by 2030, it could trade between $4.57 and $5.64, with an average price of $4.68. XRP Price Predictions for 2030 Month Min. Price Avg. Price Max.

How much will 1 XRP be worth in 2030? By 2030, XRP is projected to be between $4.57 and $5.64.

Could XRP hit $20? Maybe, in a perfect world. But even the highest XRP price predictions for the next decade don’t go much past $10. That’s not the kind of upside most traders are after. If you’re hunting for the best cheap crypto to buy now , you need something that can 100x, not just 2x. That’s why Dawgz AI is dominating the presale game.

The short was opened at $84,043, and if BTC surpasses $85,592, the position will be liquidated, triggering significant losses. While the trader is currently up $2 million in unrealized profit, they’ve already spent $200,000 in funding fees.

Source: @Ashcryptoreal https://t.co/1IdsA1kcpq pic.twitter.com/IKuE1EBZ5R — Mario Nawfal’s Roundtable (@RoundtableSpace) March 16, 2025 Analysts warn that Bitcoin must close above $81,000 this week to avoid further declines. While the Federal Reserve is expected to hold interest rates steady, any hawkish surprise could accelerate selling pressure, making this high-stakes short trade a potential market catalyst. Whale’s Short Position Fuels Market Uncertainty The sheer size of this short position is amplifying bearish sentiment in the market. However, Bitcoin is consolidating around $83,500, and traders remain cautious ahead of the FOMC decision. A break above $84,000 could liquidate shorts, driving BTC toward $86,670 or higher. Conversely, failure to hold support at $81,000 could trigger a deeper correction, potentially testing $79,900 and $76,600. All eyes are on BTC’s next move. ECB’s Villeroy Warns of U.S. Crypto Risks European Central Bank (ECB) official François Villeroy de Galhau has warned that the U.S.’s growing crypto embrace could create global financial risks. He pointed to previous crises that started in the U.S., accusing American regulators of negligence. However, he dismissed fears of a European banking crisis, arguing that Europe’s financial system remains stable. He also called for a stronger euro through deeper savings and investment policies. ECB Governing Council member Francois Villeroy de Galhau says the US risks bringing about the next financial emergency through its support of cryptocurrencies and non-bank finance https://t.co/TiLKfwuabd — Bloomberg (@business) March 16, 2025 Meanwhile, Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance has fueled optimism. His administration has reversed SEC enforcement actions against crypto firms and introduced a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. While Villeroy’s warning had little effect on BTC’s price, Trump’s policies have strengthened investor confidence. Bitcoin Landfill Battle: Lost Appeal, Human Rights Case Next? James Howells, a UK IT worker, has lost his appeal to search a landfill for a hard drive containing 8,000 BTC, now worth $660 million. The UK Court of Appeal ruled that his case had no realistic chance of success. Determined to continue his fight, Howells now plans to take his case to the European Court of Human Rights, arguing property rights violations. With the landfill set to close between 2025 and 2026, his window to recover the lost Bitcoin is shrinking. LATEST: A UK man's appeal for a permit to search a landfill for his 8,000 Bitcoin hard drive has been rejected by the UK Court of Appeals.

Bitcoin Price Analysis: Breakout or Breakdown Ahead? Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is currently trading around $83,500, consolidating within a symmetrical triangle on the 2-hour chart. The 50-period EMA at $83,400 is acting as dynamic support, signaling indecision in the market. A break above $84,000 could trigger short liquidations, pushing BTC toward $86,670 and potentially $89,600. Failure to hold above $83,500 could lead to a retest of $79,900, with further downside toward $76,600. For now, BTC remains indecisive, with the FOMC meeting likely to trigger Bitcoin’s next big move. BTC Bull: Earn Bitcoin Rewards with the Hottest Crypto Presale BTC Bull ($BTCBULL) is making waves as a community-driven token that automatically rewards holders with real Bitcoin when BTC hits key price milestones. Unlike traditional meme tokens, BTCBULL is built for long-term investors, offering real incentives through airdropped BTC rewards and staking opportunities.

Over the past few weekends, the largest cryptocurrency has experienced significant price volatility, driven by macroeconomic uncertainty including geopolitical tensions, tariffs and rising global bond yields. The weekend nervousness appears to have carried over into Mondays. Data from Velo shows the over the past three months Mondays and Thursdays have been the most negative days of the regular workweek. Sunday, however, stands out as the worst-performing day of the week overall, with an average price decline of 1%. Overall, weekends perform slightly worst than weekdays in terms of performance.

According to blockchain tracking firm Lookonchain , World Liberty Financial (WLFI) bought about $2 million worth of Avalanche ( AVAX ) and Mantle ( MNT ). Avalanche is a layer-1 Ethereum ( ETH ) rival, while Mantle is a prominent Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution. However, Lookonchain notes that WLFI’s portfolio, which includes more than 11 crypto assets, is losing on every single token, down nearly $120 million in total. “Trump’s World Liberty [Financial] bought 103,911 AVAX ($2 million) and 2.45 million MNT ($2 million)… In total, World Liberty has spent $343 million on 11 different tokens – but every single one is in the red, with a total loss of $118 million!” Source: Lookonchain/X At time of writing, AVAX is trading at $18.35 while MNT is priced at $0.826. Besides privately accumulating digital assets through WLFI, President Trump has also proposed for the US to create its own national crypto strategic reserve of Bitcoin ( BTC ) and several large-cap altcoins. Trump’s initial confirmation of the crypto reserve triggered a $100 billion surge in the global crypto market, which was ultimately short-lived. Trump framed the reserve as a response to what he called “corrupt attacks” on the crypto industry by the Biden administration, emphasizing his goal to make the US the “crypto capital of the world.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Despite this, he remains optimistic about a market rebound and advises investors to maintain a long-term perspective. Cramer says recent market volatility reflects trading action—especially zero-day options. He tells long-holders that a recovery will come. In a YouTube video, he asked investors to hold their ground even as prices dropped, adding that panicking and selling typically led to missed opportunities. He cranked up the memory of the late Mark Haines, the legendary CNBC anchor who infamously bottom-called the market in 2009 amid the financial crisis. Cramer argues that investing during down markets at correction lows can yield big returns, and people shouldn’t make knee-jerk decisions based on their reaction to jumps or drops in the short term. Cramer says the market will rebound soon Recent market downturns have been fueled by several macroeconomic factors, including the Federal Reserve’s interest rate policies, inflationary pressures, and geopolitical uncertainty. The slowdown has hit major indices such as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 hard, with technology stocks particularly suffering. But Cramer thinks the good names will bounce back despite the hurdles. He noted that the market dropped in 2020 following the COVID-19 crash, then quickly recovered. On Monday’s “Squawk on the Street,” Cramer discussed the brutal third-day crash and estimated the S&P 500 had declined by approximately $4 trillion in value since the end of the bull market in the wake of the election. He points to a general fear of recession that is causing many investors to abandon ship. And when Cramer was asked whether he was worried about a recession, he replied, “You bet I am. I don’t need a recession, let alone an artificial one. I don’t want to feel anxious about my job. Everybody’s job.” He pointed to tariffs on imports as a source of economic uncertainty, implying that the federal government could do it differently even if the U.S. has reasonable grounds to want fairer trade deals. Cramer warns against hurting small businesses Cramer also addressed a fresh report from the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) that showed more pessimism among the small business sector in February. He referred to small businesses as the backbone of the economy and warned against policies that might hurt them. “These are the people who hire the base, and they are base. And the base is the best in the world,” he said. Cramer also commented on Elon Musk’s AI firm, xAI, and its Grok AI model in comments beyond the markets. He was hopeful about Grok and suggested Musk could shake up the segment with AI moves. Cramer’s overall message hasn’t changed: Don’t make decisions out of fear, and invest for the long term. Fear can grip people during market drops, but past market history shows that staying in high-quality stocks during turbulent times can achieve good returns. He recommends investors remain calm and not make knee-jerk reactions when the markets are roiling. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

With this it has set a new all-time high for the 13th time and its market value has now surpassed $20 trillion. This has sparked questions about whether Bitcoin called “digital gold,” could see a similar rise. Bitcoin Drops Significantly On the contrary, Bitcoin has followed a different trend as its value has dropped significantly due to the ongoing pressures from macroeconomic conditions. Bitcoin is currently trading 23.3% below its all-time high, with a 14.5% drop over the last month. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $83,446, up 1% in the past 24 hours. Analysts Remain Hopeful However, despite Bitcoin’s recent struggles, analysts believe that it could follow a path similar to gold’s historic rise. In a recent X post, an analyst compared the launch of the Gold ETFs in November 2004 to Bitcoin’s ETF launch in January 2024. He suggested that Bitcoin’s price could follow a similar pattern to gold. Notably, the launch of the Gold ETF made it easier for both institutional and retail investors to gain exposure to gold. Over time, gold experienced significant price growth, with periods of highs and corrections, but maintained a long-term upward trend. According to the analysis, Bitcoin seems to be following a similar path. If this trend continues, BTC could see steady long-term growth, with its ETF acting as a key driver for institutional adoption and continued price increases. Another market analyst shared a similar view, pointing out that both gold and Bitcoin are following a five-step parabolic model. He believes that Bitcoin could soon see a big breakout, similar to gold’s past performance. He predicts that Bitcoin has already moved past its “fakeout” phase and is on track for a new all-time high. His predicts that a surge to $150,000 is on the way. BITCOIN’S FUTURE IS WRITTEN IN GOLD! Gold followed this pattern before its breakout. Now, Bitcoin is mirroring the move. The fakeout is done. ATH is next. $150K is loading! pic.twitter.com/2rIOP83nKN — Merlijn The Trader (@MerlijnTrader) March 16, 2025 Concerning Trends Emerge Not all experts are optimistic. Market analyst Northstar pointed out a concerning trend in the gold/Bitcoin ratio, saying Bitcoin has been underperforming gold for the past four years, the longest time ever. He warned that gold’s recent rise is not just about its price going up—it signals a shift in investments, which could lead to a big drop in stocks, including the NASDAQ, which Bitcoin usually tracks. Financial analyst Charlie Morris also raised concerns, noting that while gold-backed funds are seeing more investment, Bitcoin ETFs are losing value. Morris had recently shared that in the last 30 days, gold ETFs have seen $10 billion in inflows, while Bitcoin ETFs have experienced $5 billion in outflows. He suggests that eventually, these trends will reverse, as they often do. With Bitcoin currently priced around $80,000, the coming months will be crucial in deciding if it can match gold’s growth or keep underperforming.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-17 11:46:20

However, at least thus far in 2025, macroeconomic challenges have proved dominant. The cryptocurrency market , in particular, has been shaken up by the risk asset selloff that’s going on due to the possible disruptions of the Trump administration’s tariff policies. Yet despite recent challenges, XRP has performed better than most digital assets. At press time, XRP was changing hands at a price of $2.33, having marked a 12.21% gain on a year-to-date (YTD) basis after a 5.13% move to the upside in the past week. XRP price year-to-date (YTD) chart. Source: Finbold However, price action does not occur in a vacuum. The token’s current price is dangerously close to a key support level — and a renowned technical analyst has outlined exactly what a crash below that level could entail. A drop below $2 could lead to an XRP crash XRP appears to be forming a head-and-shoulders chart pattern on the weekly chart, as highlighted by noted cryptocurrency technical analyst Ali Martinez in a March 17 X post . $XRP is shaping up a head-and-shoulders on the weekly chart. It spotlights the $2 support. Holding it is crucial. pic.twitter.com/icoVFwbBB9 — Ali (@ali_charts) March 17, 2025 The head-and-shoulders pattern is a sign of reversal — indicating that the hitherto prevailing uptrend is coming to an end. This pattern consists of three peaks — the first and last of which are roughly equal and represent the ‘shoulders’, while the middle peak represents the head. The ‘neckline’ formed by the bottoms between the peaks acts as a level of support. In this particular instance, that neckline is at the $2 level, roughly 14.16% below current prices. With a head-and-shoulders pattern, a successful breakout leads prices to drop to a point equal to the distance between the ‘neckline’ and the top of the ‘head’. If the pattern is legitimate, prices moving below $2 could lead to an XRP crash which would see prices drop to approximately $1.25, for a combined drop of 46.35% compared to current prices. Lastly, readers should be aware that Martinez’s chart is dated March 16, 11:54 UTC — but his post on X came a day later. While timing is certainly important in technical analysis, no major developments occurred between the chart date and the time of the post. Escrow schedule could depress XRP prices despite widespread adoption On the other hand, as reported by Finbold on March 15, XRP is seeing a steady increase in the number of addresses, which hit a record number of 7 million recently — which highlights an increasing rate of adoption and mainstream popularity. Martinez also outlined a more bullish case — if XRP manages to break out past $3, its next major price target would be in the $4.80 to $5 range, followed by a possible rally to a new all-time high of $15. With that being said, readers should note that roughly $465 million in XRP has been moved from escrow holding, in a move that could present significant downward pressure on the asset’s price.

Peter Schiff Said ""Yes"" and Explained Why!",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/could-bitcoin-btc-drop-to-20000-again-peter-schiff-said-yes-and-explained-why/,"As Bitcoin has fallen below $80,000 in recent weeks, expectations for further declines have also increased. At this point, gold advocate and Bitcoin hater Peter Schiff claimed that the Bitcoin price could fall to $20,000 if the Nasdaq enters a bear market. $20,000 on the Table in Bitcoin Again! As Bitcoin price struggles to clear the $84,000 resistance on the upside, bearish expectations for BTC are increasing. Amid the sharp correction that the U.S. stock market has experienced over the past few weeks, the Nasdaq is down 12%. Popular economist Peter Schiff said that things could get worse for BTC if this correction slides further into a bear market and he believes that the BTC price could fall to as low as $20,000 if the Nasdaq corrects 40% from its peak and enters a bear market. Noting that the Bitcoin price and the Nasdaq have a historical correlation, Schiff said that a 12% Nasdaq drop usually equates to a 24% drop in Bitcoin, which could take BTC down to around $65,000. Citing historical data on this point, Schiff noted that the Nasdaq fell by about 80% during the dot-com bubble, 55% during the 2008 financial crisis and 30% during the 2020 COVID crash. Considering that there could be an average drop of 55%, Schiff argued that even a 40% drop in the Nasdaq index could push the BTC price down to $20,000. “The Nasdaq is down 12%. If this correction turns out to be a bear market and the correlation holds that a 12% drop in the Nasdaq equals a 24% drop in Bitcoin, then when the Nasdaq is down 20%, Bitcoin will be around $65,000. But if the Nasdaq enters a bear market, history suggests the decline will be much larger. The Nasdaq fell nearly 80% after the dot-com bubble burst. It fell 55% during the 2008 Global Financial Crisis and fell nearly 30% during the COVID crash of 2020. The average of these three bear markets is a 55% drop. If this bear market bottoms out with just a 40% drop, that would take Bitcoin to around $20,000. But my guess is that a drop of that magnitude would send Bitcoin crashing much lower.” https://twitter.com/PeterSchiff/status/1901253662178939352 *This is not investment advice.

The TON (The Open Network) token, associated with Telegram, surged 20% after the news, rising above $3.45. Durov can now travel freely, having his passport returned. The legal battle with French authorities has been described as a battle for freedom of speech. Durov has been an outspoken supporter of free speech. He co-founded the Telegram app, which has nearly a billion users, and promotes privacy and secure communication. The TON society supports Durov’s views and uses cryptocurrency to encourage freedom of speech. “We have stood behind Pavel since his arrest on August 24, 2024”, wrote the TON Society, “Pavel’s unwavering commitment to freedom of speech and transparency, despite facing the most challenging of circumstances, is a powerful reminder of the importance of standing by your principles, even when it is politically and personally detrimental to do so.” In August 2024, the TON Society condemned French authorities for detaining Durov: “The arrest of the Telegram founder, Pavel Durov, is a direct assault on a basic human right – the freedom of expression of everyone”. Durov claims that French authorities failed to communicate with him clearly, neglecting their access to his contact details and having the ability to contact his legal team. He further states that he had cooperated with authorities the entire time and does not pose a flight risk. In December 6 2024, Durov claimed that he did not create Telegram in 2013 to facilitate criminal activity. He said that around 20 million accounts and 1 million groups are deleted every month. Durov maintains that his brother and himself created Telegram as a secure messaging service, not as a vehicle for criminal activity. In September 2024, Durov posted a statement on his Telegram channel, claiming that French authorities could have contacted his EU representative instead of arresting him. He expressed dismay that a CEO would be held to account for what users did on his platform. In August 2024, Durov was arrested at Le Bourget airport and placed under investigation. He was released after paying €5 million, but he was barred from leaving the country and had his passport confiscated. French authorities, however, have accused Durov of enabling the distribution of abusive materials, drug trafficking, and organised crime. They claim that he was not cooperating with authorities and did not provide the requested information. The TON Society called on the United Nations, European Union, and the Council of Europe to intervene at the time of Durov’s arrest. Free speech advocates pointed out that Durov’s arrest put the whole movement at risk, eroding the roots of privacy-enabling technologies and committing regulatory overreach. Chris Pavlovski, CEO of Rumble, commented in August 2024 that French authorities threatened Rumble and were widely cracking down on free speech. He further stated that he could leave France safely at the time. The TON price tumbled in August 2024 after news that Durov was arrested in France became public. It is not clear how sustainable the TON token could be in the event that Telegram is banned or even partially disabled due to Durov’s persecution. Telegram’s user base has reached close to 1 billion, due in part to the platform’s use of crypto games. Crypto games are a very popular app service that has attracted over 300 million players in the space of a few months. The TON network was originally created on Telegram but has since become independent of the platform. Telegram abandoned the project when regulators started scrutinizing the token in 2020.

Many crypto enthusiasts dream of a world where digital assets like Bitcoin are recognized as legitimate reserves, bolstering national economies. However, the reality is proving to be a bit more complex, especially in countries with traditionally cautious financial approaches. South Korea, a nation known for its tech-savviness and vibrant crypto scene, has just delivered a decisive answer regarding Bitcoin’s role in its financial strategy. And it might surprise you. Let’s dive into the Bank of Korea’s recent announcement and explore what it means for Bitcoin and the future of digital asset integration in national finance. Bank of Korea’s Definitive Stance on Bitcoin and Foreign Exchange Reserves In a move that has clarified its position for the first time publicly, the Bank of Korea (BOK), South Korea’s powerful central bank , has firmly stated it has “never considered” including Bitcoin (BTC) within its foreign exchange reserves . This revelation came in response to a formal inquiry from lawmaker Cha Gyu-geun of the Rebuilding Korea Party, as reported by Korea Economy TV. This direct and unambiguous statement underscores a cautious approach by one of Asia’s major economies towards integrating cryptocurrency into traditional financial frameworks. For those unfamiliar, foreign exchange reserves are essentially assets held by central banks in different currencies, gold, and other reserve assets. These reserves are crucial for a nation’s financial stability, enabling them to: Support and maintain the value of their domestic currency in international markets. Manage balance of payments and external debt obligations. Provide a buffer against economic shocks and financial crises. Signal financial strength and credibility to international investors. The question then arises: Why wouldn’t a forward-thinking nation like South Korea , with its active cryptocurrency market, consider Bitcoin , the leading cryptocurrency, as part of these vital foreign exchange reserves ? Understanding Foreign Exchange Reserves: Could Bitcoin Ever Fit? Traditionally, foreign exchange reserves are dominated by assets known for their stability and global acceptance, such as the US dollar, Euro, Japanese Yen, and gold. These assets are chosen for their deep liquidity, established legal frameworks, and relative price stability (compared to emerging assets). Introducing a new asset like Bitcoin into this mix brings a unique set of considerations, both potential benefits and significant challenges. Potential Benefits of Including Bitcoin in Reserves (The Hypothetical Argument): Diversification: Bitcoin operates outside traditional financial systems and could offer diversification from traditional currency risks. Decentralization: As a decentralized asset, Bitcoin is not controlled by any single government or institution, potentially reducing geopolitical risks. Inflation Hedge (Argument, not proven fact): Some proponents argue Bitcoin can act as a hedge against inflation due to its limited supply, although this is still a debated topic. Technological Innovation: Embracing Bitcoin could position a nation as innovative and forward-thinking in the digital economy. Challenges and Concerns of Bitcoin as a Reserve Asset: Bitcoin’s price volatility is a major concern for central banks considering it as a reserve asset. Extreme Volatility: Bitcoin’s price is notoriously volatile, experiencing significant swings that could destabilize reserve values. This volatility is a major deterrent for risk-averse institutions like central banks. Regulatory Uncertainty: The global regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving and fragmented. This lack of clear, consistent regulations poses risks for central banks holding Bitcoin. Security Risks: Custody and security of digital assets like Bitcoin are complex. Central banks would need robust systems to prevent theft and loss, a new area of operational risk. Market Maturity and Liquidity: While Bitcoin’s market has grown, it is still less mature and less liquid compared to traditional FX reserve assets. Large-scale transactions by central banks could significantly impact the Bitcoin market price. Environmental Concerns: Bitcoin’s energy consumption, particularly from proof-of-work mining, raises environmental sustainability concerns, which are increasingly important for government institutions. Lack of Intrinsic Value (Central Bank Perspective): From a traditional central banking perspective, Bitcoin lacks intrinsic value and is not backed by a sovereign entity, unlike fiat currencies or gold. South Korea’s Cautious Approach: What’s Behind the Bank of Korea’s Decision? The Bank of Korea’s firm “no” to Bitcoin in foreign exchange reserves reflects a broader cautious stance prevalent among many central banks globally. Several factors likely contribute to this conservative approach: Risk Aversion: Central banks are inherently risk-averse institutions. Their primary mandate is to maintain financial stability and manage inflation. Bitcoin’s volatility and nascent nature are simply too risky for their core objectives. Focus on Stability: Foreign exchange reserves are intended to be a bedrock of stability during economic uncertainty. Bitcoin’s price fluctuations directly contradict this need for stability. G7 and International Monetary Fund (IMF) Stance: Major international financial bodies and G7 nations have generally expressed caution and emphasized the risks associated with cryptocurrencies, influencing central bank policies worldwide. Domestic Political Considerations: In South Korea , like many nations, there’s ongoing debate and evolving regulations around cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Korea likely prefers to wait for more regulatory clarity and international consensus before considering such a significant step. Focus on Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs): Many central banks, including the Bank of Korea , are actively exploring or developing their own Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). This focus on CBDCs suggests a preference for controlled, state-backed digital currencies over decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin for national financial infrastructure. Central Banks Globally and the Bitcoin Question: Is Anyone Saying Yes? While the Bank of Korea’s position is clear, the global landscape of central banks and Bitcoin is not monolithic. While most major central banks remain hesitant, some countries and regions are exploring or have taken small steps towards crypto integration: Central Bank/Region Bitcoin/Crypto Stance Notes Switzerland Positive, Crypto-Friendly Swiss National Bank has not added Bitcoin to reserves, but Switzerland is generally very crypto-friendly, and some cantonal banks offer crypto services. El Salvador Bitcoin as Legal Tender El Salvador adopted Bitcoin as legal tender, but its central bank’s reserve strategy regarding Bitcoin is less transparent and faces IMF scrutiny. Ukraine Crypto Donations & Adoption National Bank of Ukraine has shown openness to crypto, particularly during fundraising efforts, but no indication of Bitcoin in reserves. Emerging Economies (Some) Exploring Crypto Some emerging economies facing currency devaluation or hyperinflation may see Bitcoin as a potential alternative, but adoption in reserves remains very limited. Major Central Banks (USA, EU, Japan, UK, etc.) Cautious, Researching CBDCs Generally very cautious, focusing on regulating crypto and exploring CBDCs. No indication of Bitcoin in reserves. It’s evident that the Bank of Korea’s stance aligns with the majority of major central banks . The path to Bitcoin becoming a mainstream foreign exchange reserve asset is still fraught with obstacles, primarily due to its inherent volatility and regulatory uncertainties. Bitcoin’s Future Beyond Central Bank Reserves: What’s Next? While the Bank of Korea’s decision may seem like a setback for Bitcoin adoption by national institutions, it’s crucial to remember that this is just one aspect of Bitcoin’s evolving journey. Bitcoin’s value proposition extends far beyond being a foreign exchange reserve asset. Its key strengths remain in: Decentralized Digital Currency: Offering an alternative to traditional financial systems, empowering individuals with greater control over their finances. Store of Value (Debated): Potentially acting as a long-term store of value, especially in environments with currency devaluation. Global, Permissionless Transactions: Facilitating cross-border transactions without intermediaries, reducing costs and increasing efficiency. Technological Innovation Driver: Pushing the boundaries of financial technology and inspiring further innovation in the digital asset space. The Bank of Korea’s current stance doesn’t negate Bitcoin’s ongoing development and adoption in various other sectors – from institutional investment to retail payments and technological infrastructure. The crypto landscape is dynamic, and as regulations mature, volatility potentially decreases, and institutional understanding deepens, the conversation around Bitcoin and foreign exchange reserves may evolve in the future. For now, however, South Korea, guided by its central bank , remains firmly on the side of caution. In conclusion, the Bank of Korea’s explicit statement that it has never considered including Bitcoin in its foreign exchange reserves provides a clear snapshot of the current sentiment among major central banks.

Get ready to explore the latest crypto buzz directly from Bitcoin World’s Korean forum, revealing the top searched and mentioned cryptocurrencies between March 7th and 13th. Decoding the Top Searched Tokens in the Korean Crypto Community What are Korean crypto investors eagerly searching for? The data from Bitcoin World’s K-Community reveals a fascinating snapshot of market interest. Let’s break down the top 10 top searched tokens and see what’s driving the curiosity.

Following closely are ETH and BTC , maintaining their positions as foundational cryptocurrencies. Interestingly, we see a mix of established players like Cardano ( ADA ) and Solana ( SOL ) alongside newer or more speculative tokens such as Pi Network ( PI ), Ondo ( ONDO ), MOVE, and even the meme-inspired DOGE and TRUMP. This diverse list indicates a broad spectrum of interests within the South Korean crypto market, ranging from long-term investments to potential high-growth opportunities and meme coin trends. What Are the Top Mentioned Tokens Sparking Conversations in South Korea Crypto Circles? Searches are one thing, but what tokens are actually being discussed and debated? Mentions provide a different perspective, highlighting the cryptocurrencies that are driving active conversations and community engagement. Let’s delve into the top mentioned tokens on Bitcoin World’s K-Community. Here’s the rundown of the cryptocurrencies generating the most buzz: Rank Token Mentions 1 BTC 2,533 2 ETH 1,307 3 TRUMP 816 4 XRP 512 5 SOL 360 6 ADA 266 7 DOGE 190 8 ONDO 112 9 ARKM 66 10 SUI 59 Bitcoin ( BTC ) takes the crown for mentions with 2,533, solidifying its role as the central topic in crypto conversations. Ethereum ( ETH ) follows in second place, further emphasizing the dominance of these two giants. Interestingly, TRUMP token jumps into the top 3 mentioned tokens, indicating a significant level of discussion, potentially driven by market volatility or specific news events around this token. XRP , while topping searches, ranks fourth in mentions, suggesting perhaps more passive interest compared to active discussion. Solana ( SOL ) and Cardano ( ADA ) maintain strong positions in both searches and mentions, reflecting consistent community engagement. The presence of ARKM and SUI in the top 10 mentioned list, but not in the top searches, could suggest emerging interest and active discussions around these newer projects within the South Korea crypto space.

Here are some key takeaways: XRP’s Search Dominance, BTC’s Conversational Leadership: XRP leads in searches, indicating strong interest, while BTC leads in mentions, highlighting its central role in ongoing crypto discussions.

Established Cryptos Still Reign Supreme: BTC and ETH are consistently in the top positions for both searches and mentions, reinforcing their status as foundational assets in the crypto market, even within the dynamic South Korea crypto scene. Meme Coins and Speculative Tokens Grab Attention: The presence of DOGE and TRUMP in both lists, and PI and MOVE in searches, shows that meme coins and tokens with a speculative edge continue to capture the interest of Korean crypto investors. The high mention count of TRUMP suggests active debate and potentially volatile price action around such tokens. Emerging Tokens Sparking Conversations: The appearance of ARKM and SUI in the top mentioned tokens suggests growing interest and community engagement with newer projects. Monitoring discussions around these tokens could provide early signals of potential growth and adoption trends.

In this volatile market environment, a major whale has taken a contrarian position by establishing a highly leveraged short on Bitcoin perpetual futures via Hyperliquid. Huge Bitcoin Whale Goes Short According to data from Hyperliquid and blockchain analyst Lookonchain, the whale’s short position is valued at over $445 million and utilizes 40x leverage. This position comes with a liquidation price set at $85,940, and despite the inherent risks, the trader is already reporting an unrealized gain of $4.4 million. Pseudonymous trader CBB (@Cbb0fe) galvanized a group of market participants to target the position. Lookonchain’s report highlights a coordinated effort to force the whale’s hand: “This whale still managed to turn a profit despite being hunted by a team! 11 hours ago, @Cbb0fe publicly formed a team to hunt this whale who shorted BTC with 40x leverage. Just one hour later, the team was in action, driving BTC above $84,690 in a short period,” Lookonchain said on X. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $10 Million? Experts Predict Explosive Growth By 2035 Notably, the whale was forced to deposit $5 million USDC to increase margin and avoid liquidation. “But the hunt ultimately failed. The whale continued to increase his position to short BTC. Currently, the whale is profiting from closing positions through Twap. His current position is 5,406 BTC ($449M), with an unrealized profit of $4.4M.” the blockchain analytics service added via X. In a series of rapid-fire tweets, CBB further intensified the situation by stating: “The hunt has begun,” adding “If you are willing to hunt this dude with size, drop a DM, setting up a team right now and already got good size.” He later added: “We have lost a battle but we have not lost the war. Locked in.” and “Holy fuck please Eric Trump send help from the divine father to liquidate this mfer.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Spot ETF Exodus Continues: $900 Million Outflows Extend Losing Streak Hyperliquid has positioned itself at the forefront of this unfolding drama, emphasizing the platform’s role in providing unmatched transparency in high-leverage trading. In a statement posted on X, Hyperliquid commented: “Hyperliquid has redefined trading. When a whale shorts $450M+ BTC and wants a public audience, it’s only possible on Hyperliquid. Anyone can photoshop a PNL screenshot. No one can question a Hyperliquid position, just like no one can question a Bitcoin balance. The decentralized future is here.” Hyperliquid was recently thrust into the spotlight following an incident involving a prominent whale who executed a “liquidation arbitrage.” In that event, the extraction of floating profits led to a margin shortage that triggered forced liquidations, transferring risk to the decentralized exchange’s HLP vault. At press time, BTC traded at $83,455.

Despite the recent market correction, most crypto analysts expect the bull cycle to peak after the third quarter of 2025, with Bitcoin ( BTC ) price predictions ranging from $160,000 to above $180,000 . Beyond external concerns, such as a potential recession in the world’s largest economy, crypto’s biggest industry-specific risk is the “circular” nature of its economy, according to Arthur Breitman, the co-founder of Tezos. “Within the industry, the main risk is that the industry is still very much in search of grounding. It’s all still very circular,” Breitman told Cointelegraph. “If you look at DeFi, for example, the point of finance is to finance something [...], but if the only thing that DeFi finances is more DeFi, then that’s circular,” said Breitman, adding: “If the only reason people want to buy your token is because they feel other people will want to buy this token, that's circular.” This is in stark contrast to the stock market, which is “built on revenue-generating businesses,” making the crypto industry’s “lack of grounding” one of the main industry threats, Breitman added. Other industry insiders have also criticized the state of the crypto economy, specifically related to the latest memecoin meltdowns, which are siphoning liquidity from more established cryptocurrencies. Solana outflows. Source: deBridge, Binance Research Solana was hit by over $485 million worth of outflows in February after the recent wave of memecoin rug pulls triggered an investor flight to “safety,” with some of the capital flowing into memecoins on the BNB Chain, such as the Broccoli memecoin , inspired by the Changpeng Zhao’s dog. Related: Rising $219B stablecoin supply signals mid-bull cycle, not market top US recession fears are crypto’s biggest external risk: Tezos co-founder Beyond industry-specific events, larger macroeconomic concerns, including a potential US recession, threaten traditional and cryptocurrency markets. “In terms of macro events, I still think we could see a recession,” said Breitman, adding: “There's a lot of bullish winds for the market, but there's also a lot of traditional recession indicators which have been flashing for a while now. So I don't think you can rule it out.” Cryptocurrency markets still trade in significant correlation with tech stocks, meaning that a recession will cause a widespread sell-off, he added.

Early investors are securing their shares before the price climbs to $1. This could be a significant opportunity for those looking for long-term growth. Discover why this coin is generating excitement and how to join before it takes off. XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The buzz around XYZVerse is real. As the first-ever all-sports meme token, it’s attracting both sports fans and crypto enthusiasts, creating a unique crossover that’s gaining serious traction. With a strong presale and an engaged community, some investors are already eyeing major potential gains. More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.003333 by Stage 12, with over 70% of the $15 million milestone already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a final presale target price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Bullish Mood on $XYZ XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow. XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster , who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” Of course, in crypto, nothing is guaranteed, but the excitement is undeniable. Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans One thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that’s just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility. By bringing together traditional sports fans and the fast-moving crypto space, XYZVerse is building something different—something with entertainment value and real engagement. Could XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin? With a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Dogecoin: From Meme to Major Cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE) was launched in 2013 as a lighthearted alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies. It features the Shiba Inu dog from the “Doge” meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a capped supply, Dogecoin was designed to be abundant, with no maximum supply and 10,000 new coins mined every minute. Originally intended as a joke by creators Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, Dogecoin quickly gained a following, showcasing the power of community and social media. In 2021, Dogecoin experienced a significant surge in value, becoming one of the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, exceeding $50 billion. This growth was influenced by social media interest and endorsements from figures like Elon Musk. The coin’s technology is based on blockchain, similar to other cryptocurrencies, facilitating secure transactions. In the current market cycle, Dogecoin attracts attention due to its widespread recognition and active community. Its abundant supply and popularity make it a notable player in the cryptocurrency market, though opinions on its long-term potential vary among enthusiasts and investors. Shiba Inu: An Ethereum-Based Memecoin with Growing Utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency inspired by Dogecoin. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This allows it to interact with Ethereum’s ecosystem. Launched in August 2020 by an anonymous developer known as Ryoshi, SHIB started with a large supply of tokens. Half of these tokens were sent to Vitalik Buterin, the co-creator of Ethereum. Buterin donated a significant portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned the rest, reducing the total supply. SHIB’s integration with Ethereum enables more applications. One example is ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange. There are also plans for a future platform for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and a governance system based on decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). These developments suggest SHIB could have broader uses in the crypto space. Whether SHIB is attractive in the current market depends on various factors, including its utility and developments within the Ethereum ecosystem. PEPE: A Deflationary Meme Coin on Ethereum Inspired by Pepe the Frog PEPE is a deflationary cryptocurrency launched on the Ethereum blockchain. It was created as a tribute to the Pepe the Frog internet meme by Matt Furie, which became popular in the early 2000s. The coin aims to ride the wave of meme coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, establishing itself among the top meme-based cryptocurrencies. PEPE appeals to enthusiasts by implementing a no-tax policy and being transparent about its lack of utility, keeping it simple as a pure memecoin. In late April to May 2023, PEPE saw a rapid increase in its market capitalization, reaching a peak of $1.6 billion. This surge turned early holders into millionaires and built a strong community of supporters. The growth of PEPE contributed to a “memecoin season,” where other meme coins experienced significant volatility. The PEPE roadmap includes phases focused on increasing its visibility, such as listings on major exchanges and social media traction. The attractiveness of PEPE in the current market cycle depends on ongoing interest in meme coins and the overall cryptocurrency market trends. BONK: A Solana-Based Memecoin with Community Focus BONK is a memecoin on the Solana blockchain featuring a Shiba Inu mascot. It aims to empower the Solana community by redistributing power from venture capital tokens. After being listed on Coinbase, BONK surged over 100%. It serves as a community coin, with 50% of its supply airdropped to Solana’s NFT and DeFi participants. Despite its growth and integration into the Solana ecosystem, BONK faces challenges such as a high total supply and the volatile nature of memecoins. Its involvement in a growing ecosystem of decentralized applications, including the launch of a decentralized exchange called BonkSwap, positions BONK in the cryptocurrency space. In the current market cycle, BONK has shown significant growth and engagement within the Solana community. Its role as a community coin and developments like BonkSwap contribute to its presence in the market. Conclusion While DOGE, SHIB, PEPE, and BONK are good, XYZ unites sports fans in a community-driven memecoin aiming for massive growth—secure XYZ now before it hits $1.

As the Trump administration changes its stance from the U.S. President’s previous term and turns pro-crypto, several crypto companies with close ties to Trump and his aides have gained or set their sights on gaining from association. In the following research, we uncover Trump family businesses, ties to crypto projects, top five crypto tokens that could benefit during the administration and unpack the controversy around it all. Table of Contents Trump’s crypto holdings and TRUMP meme coin These five crypto tokens held by World Liberty Financial could rally next PayPal mafia and their ties with Trump and crypto Why Ethereum could rise from the grave Unpacking the story of Trump family’s interest in a stake in Binance Trump’s crypto holdings and TRUMP meme coin The 45th and 47th President of the United States broke more than one record when he was sworn in, on January 20, 2025. From being the first head of state to launch an official meme coin three days before joining the Oval Office to his NFT collection and pro-crypto administration, Trump has kept crypto traders on their toes this market cycle. On-chain intelligence tracker Arkham Intel identified a wallet associated with President Trump and the holdings of the address are consistent with Trump’s financial disclosures when he was running for office in November 2024. While it was clear that Trump held Ethereum ( ETH ) in his crypto wallet, the date or average price of purchase remains unclear, as the Presidential candidate at the time, was not required to disclose the same. Trump’s wallet address identified by Arkham Intel | Source: Arkham Intelligence At the time of writing, the Arkham Intel wallet shows $1.437 million worth of crypto in the wallet, it includes meme coins as well as stablecoins, tokens like Polygon ( MATIC ) and World Liberty Financial’s WFI token. Trump’s tryst with crypto is not a new one, before his official meme coin TRUMP’s launch, the President dropped an NFT collection, Official Trump Digital Trading Cards ( TRUMP ). In an interview, the U.S. President said he doesn’t know much about the coin but that it is his official meme coin, and garnered criticism from crypto analysts and experts. Commenting on the tokenomics of TRUMP token, David Zimmerman, a K33 analyst said , “There’s no sugar-coating this – these tokenomics are horrendous for a meme-coin.” The project’s tokenomics data shows that 800 million TRUMP tokens, 80% of the total supply, are owned by Trump-controlled entities. The entities are free to sell their holdings at various points over the next three years, starting in April. On an average, Trump’s companies can sell 24 million TRUMP tokens a month, at the current prices it amounts to $279.84 million of selling pressure a month, or $3.358 billion a year. This data keeps changing as TRUMP price fluctuates. At the time of writing, TRUMP is traded against 11.66 USDT. TRUMP token ranks in the top 50 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. These five crypto tokens held by World Liberty Financial could rally next The Trump family holds crypto tokens, including First Lady Melania Trump, Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, Eric and Barron Trump. Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump’s holdings are not clear from any on-chain wallet address tracker, however the two hold crypto through World Liberty Financial. In an interview, the U.S. President said his youngest son Barron Trump is the mind behind the World Liberty Financial project and holds crypto tokens in four different wallets. However, no primary sources have been identified to ascertain his holdings. Melania Trump holds the meme coin MELANIA ( MELANIA ), launched by her incorporated company MKT World LLC, a firm that powers various ventures for the First Lady, including selling portraits of her during Trump’s previous administration, according to a BBC report . Details about the MELANIA token are limited, but the official website notes that the first lady’s team has reserved 35% of the token’s supply, and this was locked for the first 30 days post-issuance. Criticizing Trump and the First Lady, Grzegorz Drozdz, market analyst at investment firm Conotoxia, was quoted by the BBC : “The introduction of these coins during the presidential inauguration raises concerns about potential conflicts of interest and may undermine the dignity of the president and the first lady.” Norman Eisen, a former ethics adviser in the Obama administration told the Washington Post, “This may represent the single worst conflict of interest in the modern history of the presidency.” Eisen believes that Trump’s crypto ties mean that the President stands to gain from his pro-crypto administration and regulatory changes. The top five tokens held by Trump family-owned business World Liberty Financial are Ethereum, staked Ether (stETH), Move ( MOVE ), Tron ( TRX ) and WhiteRock (WHITE), according to on-chain data from Arkham Intel . The World Liberty Financial wallet reportedly holds over $77.8 million in crypto and their top holdings include $15 million in Ethereum (7.931K ETH), $9.44 million in staked Ether (4.976K stETH), $9 million in Tron (40.178 million in TRX), $3.47 million in Movement (7.581 million MOVE) and $295.84K in Ondo Finance (342K ONDO ). With the Trump administration’s pro-crypto stance, fast-paced regulatory changes, executive orders and events like the White House Crypto Summit, the tokens of these crypto projects are likely to benefit in the long term. It is worth noting that Sui ( SUI ), Solana ( SOL ) and Ondo sponsored Trump’s inauguration event. Eric Trump reportedly holds Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana and Sui, according to a Cointelegraph report.

With these tokens in the firm’s wallet there is a likelihood of their recovery and gains in the later part of the market cycle, therefore sidelined traders can do their research and consider taking a position in ETH, TRX, ONDO, MOVE and WHITE or consider adding the cryptos to their portfolio while they trade within the buy zone in the dip.

Author Jimmy Soni’s book, “The Founders: the Story of PayPal and the Entrepreneurs Who Shaped Silicon Valley,” examines PayPal’s founders, and this is where Soni coined the term PayPal mafia. Of the group, David Sacks (AI & Crypto Czar in Trump’s administration), Elon Musk (head of the Department of Government Efficiency) and Peter Thiel (supporter of Trump and Vice President J.D.Vance) are the prominent figures in this market cycle. Trump’s pick for AI & Crypto Czar, Sacks, has been touted as a Solana bull for a long time in the crypto community. On investigating the ties of the executive with the crypto project, it is clear that PayPal wants to make payments on Solana through its PYUSD stablecoin. Solana has found a place in Trump’s executive order for Strategic Crypto Reserve, and the project funded Trump’s inauguration. PayPal is also associated with Layer Zero and Aptos ( APT ) for their investment in the projects. Interestingly, Solana is among one of the tokens held by Eric Trump, as mentioned earlier in the story. Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, a venture capital firm, invested $200 million and bought Bitcoin and Ethereum later summer to early fall of 2024. While it is clear that the VC firm acquired the two cryptocurrencies, there is no information about the average purchase price. Founders Fund started buying BTC when the price was $30,000, according to a Reuters report from February 2024. Thiel is a special mention among close aides of the Trump administration since the PayPal founder said on the Joe Rogan podcast that he would do everything in his capacity to support Trump except to endorse him. Thiel’s VC firm has since invested in nearly half a dozen crypto projects, Helius DEX on Solana, and the Pudgy Penguins NFT collection, among others. Musk has been in murky waters with regulators for his association with Dogecoin, his comments on X and his contact with the development team since 2019. The DOGE department is a nod to the ticker symbol of the largest meme coin in the crypto ecosystem.

The $2,000 level was considered a key psychological support level for Ether, and closing under this level, the altcoin quashed hopes of a recovery in March 2025. While Ethereum is in a state of decline, it may be inappropriate to declare Ether dead just yet. With Ethereum ranking as the highest-valued holding in WLF’s crypto wallet, the largest altcoin is likely poised for a recovery, even if it comes a cycle behind Bitcoin. To support the thesis, it is key to note that Vitalik Buterin recently commented on changes within the Ethereum Foundation. The entity addressed the rumours and speculation surrounding the Foundation’s dissolution, and Buterin shared an optimistic vision for the project. At the Based Rollup Summit, Buterin reminded the community of Ethereum’s core objectives and said the project continues to focus on providing a decentralized network that prioritizes openness, censorship resistance, and security. The foundational principles continue to guide Ethereum’s development as the chain prepares to scale for further adoption. https://twitter.com/taikoxyz/status/1899431277767332234 Unpacking the story of Trump family’s interest in a stake in Binance Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that the Trump family is looking to buy a stake in the world’s largest centralized crypto exchange, Binance. The story explained founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao’s role and stated facts that CZ has since denied. The story says CZ was pardoned for his 2023 guilty plea as discussions for stake in Binance’s U.S. arm advanced. CZ treats the contents of the story as allegations and denies it in a tweet on X, telling the crypto community of traders that no part of it is true. https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1900194883891322948 In his following tweets, CZ explains how most parts of the story are simply not true and says the WSJ publication is reminiscent of the previous administration’s “war on crypto.” Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

The Heroes of Mavia game continued to function, though the native token was left behind as interest in Web3 gaming diminished. Heroes of Mavia (MAVIA), one of the leading Web3 games during the 2021 boom, is trying to recover its influence. The MAVIA token was among the strongest gainers on Monday, with a non-stop rally taking the asset to a one-month high. For the past few days before the rally, MAVIA was showing signs of being oversold and forgotten. The token had been sliding for months, but it finally broke out with a strong rally today. Heroes of Mavia (MAVIA) gained to a one-month low, trying to break out of its long-term sliding trend. | Source: Coingecko MAVIA appreciated by up to 370% at one point to trade at $0.56. MAVIA had a strong bounce from the recent lows, trading at $0.11 over the weekend. The token has been unraveling since last year’s launch, sliding from a peak above $9.70. Heroes of Mavia was relatively late to arrive on the Web3 gaming stage, and its native token had to adapt to the 2024 conditions. The current MAVIA pump is highly leveraged and risky. Within a day, open interest for MAVIA rose from $430K to over $14M. The pump is expected to also reverse sharply, as funding switched to negative 2%. Some of the reasons for rallies may be aggressive shorting of seemingly inactive ‘dead’ coins. The MAVIA token was more than 51% short, which may have caused traders to pump the asset and liquidate short positions. MAVIA and similar tokens can also achieve up to 5X growth in the short term, becoming appealing tools for fast gains as memes and other narratives slow down. Heroes of Mavia hinted at new features Heroes of Mavia is a civilization-building game, where players must expand and defend their base. The game’s goal is to bring wider adoption of Web3 features, where players retain on-chain ownership of gaming items, their bases, and progress. The Heroes of Mavia game only carries a few dozen wallets daily, with some players choosing the off-chain version. The game itself boasts over 1.1M downloads and a vocal social media community. Heroes of Mavia aims to repair its features and grow its reputation, as the game has only earned 3.3 stars on Google Play. The game is now trying to revive its online presence, recently launching an intern account coinciding with the MAVIA token pump. New intern just dropped. GM Mavians! — Heroes of Mavia (@MaviaGame) March 17, 2025 The game’s team also made several pre-announcements, including new gaming features . In the past months, gamers complained of unfair mechanics, which did not allow for mining sufficient gold to perform attacks. Despite the flawed game mechanics, MAVIA proved resilient. The token depends on Bybit and Gate.IO listings, achieving over $127M in daily volumes. MAVIA was considered a token that could easily reach $1B valuation based on the game’s reputation. However, the asset did not benefit from the 2024 bull market, instead losing most of its value. MAVIA revives Web3 gaming Gaming tokens have been trading in the background, down from their previous peaks, but attempting a recovery. Gaming projects retain users or often offer free tokenless versions, and keep building one of the leading on-chain use cases. The Web3 gaming sector is valued at $11.87M, with an overall rally in the green led by the MAVIA unexpected pump. Gaming projects are also trying to offer utility or platforms for other features. Currently, ImmutableX (IMX) is the leading gaming token. Older projects are also trying to make a comeback, including GALA, SAND, and Axie Infinity (AXS). RONIN remains one of the most active tokens, offering an NFT and gaming platform and carrying all of the Axie Infinity assets. Web3 gaming did not recover during the 2024 bull cycle, as interest shifted to meme tokens and AI agents. The current MAVIA rally is seen as unexpected and unrelated to an overall gaming trend. Despite this, risky traders and smart money can seek out older tokens that can still achieve significant pumps.

Jason Calacanis, however, ruled out the possibility of Ripple-affiliated cryptocurrency XRP being Bitcoin’s replacement, claiming that it is controlled by just “a few individuals.” XRP Is Centralized Prominent angel investor Jason Calacanis previously contended that XRP was a “centrally controlled security,” unlike Bitcoin. At the time, Calacanis forecasted that there would be “chaos” if the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Calacanis also postulated earlier that XRP was a “disaster” that was “clearly going to zero.” Calacanis has doubled down on his criticism of the fourth-largest cryptocurrency. In a recent post on the X social media platform, he described XRP as “centralized and controlled by a few individuals.” Will Bitcoin Be Inevitably Replaced? Despite being a long-time Bitcoin proponent, Jason Calacanis also thinks the top cryptocurrency is bound to eventually lose its crown, with another digital asset emerging on top of the Bitcoin network. “Bitcoin has been a wonderful game, but with a couple of giant players cornering the market, the timing is right to “build a better Bitcoin” — restarting the game,” prominent angel investor and internet entrepreneur Jason Calacanis told his 982K X followers. Calacanis, an early investor in Bitcoin-related companies like Robinhood and Keza, stated that “all technology gets replaced over time… and Bitcoin will be no different.” Bitcoin proponents and founders of Bitcoin-related companies were quick to fire back at Calacanis’ comments. “There’s no better Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the immaculate conception, the Big Bang of digital assets. It cannot be recreated. What it lacks in functionality can be built on L2s,” Lightspark CEO David Markus posited . “Trying to build a better Bitcoin is a fool’s errand.” Meanwhile, Swan Bitcoin co-founder Brady Swenson stressed that “winning protocols don’t get replaced; they are built upon.” “Bitcoin will never be replaced as a protocol for value transfer. The race is still on for the winning second layer protocol,” Swenson added.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,BTC|XRP|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-17 12:08:20

There are rumours that the regulator will drop its four-year-old legal battle against Ripple soon. In July 2023, when Judge Analisa Torres ruled in support of Ripple’s argument that XRP was not a security, the XRP price climbed by at least 101% before experiencing a notable drop. Considering this historic trend, if the SEC withdraws its legal proceedings against Ripple, the price of XRP may experience massive growth. Dive in for more details! Ripple Is Negotiating with the SEC It was the permanent injunction placed on Ripple’s XRP sales to institutional investors that truly crippled the growth potential of XRP. It has been confirmed by multiple sources that Ripple is negotiating with the SEC to remove the injunction before the dismissal of the case. Experts suggest that removing legal restrictions on XRP sales could boost investor confidence. AI Predictions for XRP Price Increase An analysis conducted using ChatGPT reveals that if the XRP market repeats its July 2023 reaction, the XRP price could rise approximately 101%. Currently, the price of XRP stands at $2.33. A 101% growth means the price could touch nearly 4.68%. The same analysis notes that a stronger reaction could push the price to at least 150%, reaching $5.82. The analysis also states that if a bull market joins in, the price may rise by 200% to $6.99. Regulatory clarity, market conditions, institutional demand and FOMO will influence price movement. Conversely, some analysts warn that the XRP market has already factored in the settlement. Without a surprise element, XRP may not rise as much as expected. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple News: John Deaton Shuts Down False Claims About XRP in State-Level Payments , Possible US Government XRP Purchase US might use the $125 million settlement money to buy XRP. If this happens, it could increase confidence in the XRP market. Reports also indicate that once the lawsuit is settled, Ripple may launch an IPO. According to an analysis, if Ripple launches an IPO, the price of XRP could reach as high as $10 . In conclusion, the Ripple vs. SEC case is nearing its conclusion, and its impact on XRP remains uncertain. If the market reacts strongly, XRP could see a big rally, but some experts believe expectations have already been priced in. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In a press release sent to crypto.news, Bitget Wallet reveals its latest security upgrade, which would directly integrate Maximal Extractable Value Protection or MEV protection directly into the platform’s Swap feature. Users can check whether the security feature is activated by checking the “MEV” logo on the Swap page or within the transaction signature page. The MEV Protection upgrade is designed to prevent unfair trading mechanisms that are usually employed by MEV bots. It applies across multiple chains, including Ethereum ( ETH ), Base ( BASE ), BNB Chain ( BNB ), Polygon ( MATIC ), Arbitrum ( ARB ), Solana ( SOL ) and other major blockchains. Bitget Wallet aims to eliminate vulnerabilities related to MEV bot activity. Historically, MEV bots target liquidity pools by frequently manipulating crypto asset prices, thereby spreading false market sentiments among traders. Bitget Wallet claims its system can block these false price fluctuations, ensuring users receive accurate and fair market prices. You might also like: Bitget Wallet unveils new AI Token Analysis feature In addition, another tactic MEV bots tend to use is gas fee inflation during high demand trades. Bitget Wallet’s latest upgrade predicts reasonable gas fee ranges, thus preventing artificial bidding wars on the platform. This way, users are protected from excessive transaction costs while ensuring trade stability. COO of Bitget Wallet, Alvin Kan, stated the firm’s plans to continuously improve the platform by introducing more security features in the future and expanding its services to include more blockchain networks. “As MEV threats evolve, strengthening protection mechanisms remains essential for ensuring a stable and reliable trading environment,” said Kan in his statement. How disastrous are MEV bot attacks? MEV bots are deployed on the blockchain to look for opportunities to make a profit in the market and automatically carry out trading activities at a rapid pace. In recent months, crypto traders have reported major losses due to undetected MEV manipulation, emphasizing the importance of preventive measures to ensure market fairness. On March 12, a crypto trader lost over $215,000 while executing a stablecoin transfer due to an MEV bot sandwich attack. According to data from Etherscan , the attack occurred on Uniswap ( UNI ) v3’s USDC ( USDC ) -USDT ( USDT ) liquidity pool, with more than $35 million worth of stablecoins stored in it. Is anyone safe using DeFi? A user on @Uniswap v3 was just sandwiched attacked out of $216k while simply trying to swap $221k USDC to USDT. Mind you, this was a pool that had over $35m of USDC and USDT it. This is insane. How did it happen? An MEV bot front-ran the tx by… pic.twitter.com/cyzu4M6qfz — Michael Nadeau | The DeFi Report (@JustDeauIt) March 12, 2025 Founder of The DeFi Report Michael Nadeau explained that the bot front-ran the transaction and temporarily removed all the USDC liquidity from the pool before the user’s transaction was executed. As a result of the drained liquidity, the user received a worse exchange rate, resulting in a $216,000 loss. Not only that, the bot operator even paid $200,000 to a block builder named bobTheBuilder to ensure the attack’s success. In the end, the attacker walked away with a $8,000 profit from the bot attack.

This growth amid the overall uncertainty drove the combined market cap of these crypto assets above $219 billion last week, placing them $10 billion away from Ethereum’s market cap at the time. However, at the time of writing, data from CoinMarketCap shows the stablecoin market cap sitting around $233 billion, surpassing Ethereum’s current capitalization by at least $3 billion. Stablecoin Supply Is Growing Usually, there are two primary reasons stablecoins begin to see an increase in their supply and, thus, market cap: a rise in buying power or risk aversion. Market analysts have always maintained that cryptocurrencies need to witness a rise in stablecoin liquidity for bitcoin (BTC) to experience a sustained rally. As with most bull markets, altcoins shoot up when BTC sustains an upward trajectory. With an increase in liquidity, users’ buying power surges, with investors positioning themselves to acquire more assets at lower prices after market sentiment improves. The second reason, risk aversion, entails investors’ flight to safety. Since the market has been dumping for eight weeks, participants may convert their assets into stablecoins to preserve capital. This indicates that they are exercising caution and being even more careful in their investment approach. On-chain intelligence platform IntoTheBlock believes the latter is the case currently. The firm stated that the growth in the combined stablecoin market cap is a strong indicator of rising caution in the market. Stablecoins continue to gain ground amid market uncertainty, pushing their combined market cap to around $219 billion this week. Remarkably, they’re now only $10 billion away from Ethereum’s market cap, a strong indicator of rising caution in the market. pic.twitter.com/35O5fbyeLW — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) March 14, 2025 Could This Cycle Be Halfway in? Furthermore, the growth in stablecoin supply raises concerns about the market hitting its peak for this bull run because such surges have historically aligned with cycle highs. However, IntoTheBlock insists that this cycle is still halfway in. “In April 2022, supply hit $187B—just as the bear market started. Now it’s at $219B and still rising, suggesting we’re likely still mid-cycle,” the intelligence firm stated . Moreover, historical data also shows that the market has peaked 12-18 months post-halving. Since the last halving was in April 2024, IntoTheBlock believes the bull cycle will likely end mid to late 2025, even though institutional flows and regulatory changes have reshaped this cycle. Meanwhile, recent stablecoin activity examined by market analytics platform CryptoQuant reveals that investors, especially whales, are accumulating BTC, regardless of the continued correction in prices.

Speculation swirls around the “Tether FUD” message and his potential motives as a potential “HL insider.” Some theorists suggest he possesses unreleased information about Tether’s USDT stablecoin stability. Others argue he’s a former exchange employee leveraging internal knowledge to manipulate markets. Yet, no concrete evidence supports these claims beyond his chosen alias. Instead, his moniker hints at a deliberate nod to past controversies surrounding Tether’s reserves. Meanwhile, the crypto market watches closely as whales escalate their efforts against “Tether FUD.” Public sentiment on X reflects growing curiosity about his identity and strategy. Nevertheless, details remain scarce, leaving room for conjecture among analysts and traders. For now, the hunt continues, fueled by the whales’ determination to unmask this mysterious figure.

Accordingly, two fresh whales purchased AUCTION, Uniswap (UNI), and MKR from Binance. According to Spot on Chain’s post, fresh whales have turned to DeFi tokens, taking advantage of low prices. Whale “0xace” purchased 374,333 UNI worth $2.3 million and 1,735 MKR worth $2.06 million. Whale “0xEc1” withdrew 500,000 AUCTIONs worth $13.9 million from Binance in the last 3 days. This could be one of four whale wallets that collectively purchased 26.2% of the total AUCTION supply in just 21 days, currently making $32.9 million (+87%) in unrealized profits.

He also reaffirmed that tariffs on U.S. steel and aluminum will move forward with no exemptions. Trump confirmed that the reciprocal and sectoral tariffs, starting at the beginning of next month, will target trading partners, including China and India. According to reporters aboard Air Force One, he ruled out exemptions on steel and aluminum tariffs. The proposed tariff measures aim to address trade imbalances by imposing duties equivalent to those levied on U.S. exports. Trump previously said that his administration was preparing what he dubbed reciprocal tariffs — which would hit imports from each country with a tariff rate determined based on a calculation incorporating its own tariff and non-tariff barriers. According to Bloomberg, the remarks signaled that Trump plans to press ahead with a more aggressive tariff regime despite initial moves “roiling financial markets and straining alliances.” Trump says tariffs will apply to friends and foes alike without exemption Yahoo Finance reported that President Trump’s tariffs are reshaping U.S. trade policy and overhauling decades of free-trade agreements with friends and foes alike. Trump said he would impose broad reciprocal and sector-specific tariffs starting early next month. He also told reporters aboard Air Force One that both types of levies would be placed on foreign goods imported to the U.S. According to Trump, April 2 is going to be a liberating day for the U.S. because the country will be “getting back some of the wealth that very, very foolish presidents gave away because they had no clue what they were doing.” The president also said he wants to prepare key U.S. industries, including automobiles, steel, aluminum, microprocessors, and pharmaceuticals. However, whether sectoral tariffs will be incorporated into or added to the reciprocal tariff regime remains unclear. “They charge us, and we charge them. Then, in addition to that, on autos, on steel, on aluminum, we’re going to have some additional tariffs.” ~ President Donald J. Trump Trump’s administration imposed 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports on Wednesday last week, impacting Europe, along with Canada, Mexico, and others. However, the president subsequently offered a one-month extension for goods compliant with the North American ‘USMCA’ trade deal negotiated during his first term. Trump has also said Canadian energy and potash, a key fertilizer, would only be hit with a 10% tax. The European Union (EU) retaliated with targeted levies on U.S. goods starting in April, and Canada also responded with retaliatory tariffs. Trump promises tariffs will make America rich again Trump promised to usher in a “golden age of America” through a combination of tariffs, tax cuts, government regulations, and spending trimming. He boasted that America’s momentum, spirit, pride, and confidence were all back a few weeks into the second term of his presidency. New tariffs on goods from America’s largest trading partners, Mexico, Canada and China – countries that account for about 40% of US exports and 42% of imports – took effect on the same day as the announcement. The president argued that tariffs were about making America rich again and great again. He added that the measures were necessary to restore fairness in trade, restart industrialization, create jobs, and help achieve geopolitical goals. Trump criticized countries like the European Union, China, Brazil, and India for imposing higher tariffs on American goods, deeming the current system unfair. However, Investing.com noted that the impending tariffs had sparked global concerns about escalating trade tensions and potential retaliatory measures from affected nations. Trump spoke of big gains from tariffs, saying a $1.7 trillion manufacturing revival was underway, and it paved the way for large foreign investments that would otherwise not have landed in the United States.

The collapse of Mt. Gox in 2014 —where 850,000 Bitcoin ( BTC ) vanished—was supposed to be crypto’s ‘never again’ moment. The industry was built on the promise of financial sovereignty, yet a decade later, we’re still stuck at square one. You might also like: Crypto wallet security needs a rethink | Opinion Bybit’s recent hack resulted in the loss of hundreds of millions—possibly up to $1.5 billion—in user funds, making it one of the largest crypto security breaches to date. While the exchange has continued operating, the attack exposes a deeper issue: crypto’s weakest list are centralized exchanges. Instead of eliminating single points of failure, the industry keeps rebuilding them, creating systems that are opaque, centralized, and fragile—on an increasingly larger scale. Crypto was meant to free users from traditional financial institutions. Instead, most users are still trapped, reliant on centralized exchanges that control their funds. These platforms function like black boxes, vulnerable to insider manipulation, data breaches, and outright collapse—like banks, but without legal protections or regulatory oversight. And the system isn’t broken. It’s working exactly as designed—just not in users’ favor. But if crypto was supposed to be an exit from traditional finance, why are we still relying on middlemen to hold our assets? If decentralization was the goal, why is trading activity concentrated in a handful of exchanges that function just like the banks crypto was meant to replace— with even fewer safeguards? Crypto has rebuilt the financial prisons it was meant to destroy The CEX model forces users to deposit funds into a centralized pool controlled by the exchange. Those funds are commingled, stored alongside sensitive customer data, and managed by a single entity. This makes them perfect targets for hackers. It’s not a question of if an exchange will be compromised—it’s a question of when and how much users will lose next time. For all of the crypto’s talk about decentralization, most trading still happens on centralized platforms that look and behave just like banks—except without deposit insurance, fraud protection, or oversight. If this model was unacceptable in traditional finance, why is it so common in crypto? The justification for centralized exchanges has always been that they provide liquidity—that without them, crypto markets would be inefficient and fragmented. But at what cost? Liquidity isn’t real if it vanishes the moment an exchange fails; markets aren’t open if a handful of insiders control prices. Ownership is meaningless if users can’t access their assets when they need them most. After all, if your funds can be frozen, is that financial freedom? If your exchange can front-run your trades, is that an open market? If your assets disappear overnight in a hack, was that ever real ownership? Bybit’s hack is yet another reminder that crypto’s biggest players benefit from centralization, not decentralization. The more power exchanges have, the more they can dictate fees, control access, and profit from their own liquidity pools. It’s time to correct course The next phase of crypto needs true ownership without barriers or intermediaries. If crypto is to survive, it can’t just be more decentralized. It needs to fundamentally change how assets, markets, and users interact. That means liquidity that moves across chains, not locked inside CEX wallets. It means self-custody that doesn’t sacrifice usability, so users don’t have to choose between control and convenience. And it means markets where users—not insiders—control price discovery. Right now, the industry is stuck in a loop. Every few years, another centralized platform collapses, wiping out billions in user funds. Each time, the cycle repeats because there is no viable exit from the system. If crypto is ever going to be a real alternative to traditional finance, it can’t rely on the same fragile, centralized infrastructure. The only way out is to leave CEXs behind The Bybit hack should be a wake-up call. But will it? Centralized exchanges profit from keeping users trapped. They control liquidity, set arbitrary fees, and act as market makers in their own trading platforms. As long as that remains true, we’ll keep seeing the same failures again and again. The answer isn’t another exchange, another centralized lending desk, or another rebranded DeFi platform that functions just like the institutions it claims to replace. The answer is building infrastructure where users don’t have to trust middlemen at all. Crypto has a choice: build an actual exit or stay trapped in the same walled gardens until the next inevitable collapse. It’s time to start building.

Meanwhile, Debiex was ordered to pay $2.5 million for running a romance scam and manipulating victims into transferring funds under false pretenses. In the meme coin sector, blockchain analysis exposed Hayden Davis’ alleged insider trading with the WOLF token, which is following a pattern similar to his previous fraudulent projects. Wemix Hack Sparks Controversy The Wemix Foundation recently addressed the concerns over the delayed disclosure of a major hack that resulted in over $6 million in losses. During a press conference, CEO Kim Seok-hwan firmly denied any attempt to cover up the incident, despite criticisms that the official announcement came four days after the attack. On Feb. 28, hackers exploited the Play Bridge Vault, which is a crucial system for transferring WEMIX tokens between blockchain networks, and managed to withdraw 8.6 million tokens. The foundation only acknowledged the attack on March 4, which raised some serious questions among investors and the wider crypto community. Emergency Meeting on Hacking Damage Kim defended the decision by explaining that an immediate announcement could have exposed the platform to even more vulnerabilities. The team needed time to fully assess the breach and prevent additional exploits, while also trying to mitigate panic in the market. The hacker reportedly got access by stealing the authentication key for the monitoring system of Nile, Wemix’s NFT platform. Over a span of two months, they meticulously prepared for the attack before executing a series of abnormal transactions. Out of 15 withdrawal attempts, 13 were successful, and the stolen tokens were quickly liquidated on exchanges outside of South Korea. Upon discovering the breach, Wemix shut down its servers and launched an internal investigation. The company also filed a formal complaint with the Cyber Investigation Team of the Seoul National Police Agency, which has since started probing the incident. Kim acknowledged that delaying the announcement was his decision and took full responsibility for the consequences, including the impact on investors. WEMIX price over the past month (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Despite efforts to avoid market panic, the price of WEMIX still suffered a sharp decline. The token fell by close to 40% from its pre-hack value, dropping from $0.70 on Feb. 27 to $0.52 on Feb. 28. By the time the hack was publicly disclosed on March 4, the price further slumped to $0.42. While it has since recovered slightly to $0.57, the asset is still far below its pre-hack level. Crypto Scam Debiex Ordered to Pay $2.5 Million While Wemix is dealing with the aftermath from its hack, crypto trading platform Debiex was ordered to pay approximately $2.5 million after failing to respond to a lawsuit by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The lawsuit accused it of operating a romance scam ring. Arizona federal court Judge Douglas Rayes granted the CFTC’s motion for summary judgment on March 13, requiring Debiex to return around $2.26 million that it stole from customers and pay a civil penalty of nearly $221,500. The judge determined that Debiex’s failure to respond was not due to “excusable neglect.” (Source: CourtListener ) The CFTC’s lawsuit was filed in January of 2024, and it alleged that Debiex engaged in a “pig butchering” scam, in which its operators built romantic relationships with victims over social media to gain trust and convince them to invest. At least five victims fell prey to the scheme, and collectively deposited approximately $2.3 million into Debiex accounts. Instead of engaging in legitimate trading, Debiex simply stole the funds. The CFTC also targeted Zhāng Chéng Yáng , and accused him of acting as a “money mule” for Debiex by facilitating the movement of stolen funds through crypto wallets. On March 12, Judge Rayes granted a default judgment against Zhāng, ruling that the CFTC sufficiently alleged his involvement in handling illicit digital assets. One of Zhāng’s wallets on OKX held about 63 Ethereum worth around $119,500 and a small amount of Tether, and was ordered to be transferred to an unnamed victim. According to the court, OKX was voluntarily preserving the funds. The complaint described how Debiex’s operators posed as female traders on social media, and engaged with victims with conversations and fabricated images to establish trust. Victims were eventually lured to Debiex’s website, which falsely advertised itself as a decentralized trading platform that offers futures trading and mining transactions. Once victims transferred their crypto, the platform manipulated their accounts with fabricated balance updates, false trading positions, and nonexistent profits. The CFTC stated that all of this information was likely fraudulent and that the victims’ funds were instead funneled through multiple digital wallets to obscure their final destination. Luckily, regulators are increasingly taking action against fraudulent platforms that exploit trust and social engineering tactics to steal digital assets. Blockchain Analysis Exposes Insider Trading Also facing some trouble is Hayden Davis, the creator of the failed Libra (LIBRA) token. He launched another meme coin with concerning on-chain patterns that suggest serious insider trading activity. The new Solana-based token is called Wolf (WOLF) , and was released on March 8, capitalizing on speculation that Jordan Belfort, known as the Wolf of Wall Street, was launching his own coin. The token quickly reached a $42 million market cap before collapsing by over 99% in just two days. Blockchain analytics platform Bubblemaps identified suspicious activity linked to the token’s launch, and pointed out that 82% of the supply was concentrated under a single entity. Further analysis revealed transfers across 17 addresses, all tracing back to an address controlled by Davis. Bubblemaps shared that this pattern closely resembled the activity that was seen with previous tokens launched by Davis, including HOOD and LIBRA. Davis’ latest launch happened just weeks after the dramatic collapse of the Libra token, where eight insider wallets withdrew $107 million in liquidity, wiping out $4 billion in market value within hours. The Libra incident even became a political controversy after Argentine President Javier Milei’s endorsement of the coin led to impeachment risks. Argentine lawyer Gregorio Dalbon requested an Interpol Red Notice for Davis, arguing that his financial resources could make it possible for him to evade law enforcement. The increasing prevalence of insider manipulation in the meme coin space is raising concerns about its impact on retail investors. Anastasija Plotnikova, the CEO of blockchain regulatory firm Fideum, warned that meme coins have shifted from community-driven projects to tools for value extraction. Regulatory efforts to fight against meme coin-related fraud are gaining momentum in the United States. A New York lawmaker recently introduced a bill to establish criminal penalties for cryptocurrency fraud, specifically targeting deceptive practices associated with rug pulls and virtual token scams.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-17 13:27:36
33767162,[object Object],1742218105,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,The 3 Best Altcoins to Buy as SEC Publishes Proposal for XRP Strategic Asset,https://bitcoinist.com/best-altcoins-to-buy-sec-proposal-xrp/,"Every week someone floats the idea their favorite crypto coin should be a strategic asset of the US government. This week, Ripple’s XRP has been nominated, and the SEC Crypto Task Force seems to like it a lot. So much so that they published it on their website. It’s not an official proposal, but publishing it on the SEC website indicates that the SEC Crypto Task Force is perhaps seriously considering it This renewed political spotlight on crypto could be good news when researching the best altcoins to buy. XRP Viewed as Having ‘Much More Potential Than Bitcoin’ The one behind the XRP proposal is a financial analyst named Maximilian Staudinger, and he wrote on X that ‘Bitcoin is much scarcer than most people think, and XRP has incredible potential.’ The proposal seems to have caught the eye of investors. In the past 24 hours, the value of XRP has shot up by almost 56%, sitting at around $2.33 per token. According to the plan, 30% of the $5T held by the US global Nostro accounts can be replaced by XRP. This would produce $1.5T which can be used to boost the suggested Bitcoin strategic reserve. Nostro accounts are bank accounts held in a foreign country by a domestic bank in the currency of that country, and the US is holding $5T in these accounts internationally. It also recommends XRP becomes integrated into the US financial system to pay state-level payments, such as social security. This would apparently produce annual savings of up to $7.5B. XRP does have its pros – it can process 1,500 transactions per second, compared to Bitcoin’s 7 transactions and Ethereum’s 30. XRP can also finalize transactions in less than 5 seconds, compared to Bitcoin which can take up to 60 minutes. XRP Plan Branded As ‘Completely Unrealistic’ Staudinger’s proposal is audacious in scope, but it has been criticized by many as completely unrealistic. How could the US government implement this when two-thirds of the total supply are controlled by the entity that created them? Add to that the obstacle of the SEC suing Ripple Labs back in 2020 , alleging XRP was sold as an unregistered security. That case is still ongoing, with the SEC demanding significant fines be imposed. How are they going to get past that? Staudinger’s Bitcoin Plan Also Makes Him Lose Credibility Staudinger also weighed in on the suggested Bitcoin strategic reserve, recommending that the US uses the freed up $1.5T of Nostro account funds to ‘buy more Bitcoin than actually exists’ (25M $BTC at $60K a token). This is impossible, since the total supply is only 21M and more can’t be made. Also, the current $BTC price is just $83K and can’t be arbitrarily lowered to $60K to suit the government. However, despite weird proposals being submitted to the US government every other week, it still shows a bullish crypto market. Bitcoin and now XRP are in the political spotlight, and will have a positive knock-on effect with altcoins and meme coins . With that in mind, let’s look at the three best altcoins to buy which could do very well if things keep going the way they are. 1. BTC Bull ($BTCBULL) – Get Airdrop Rewards As Bitcoin Gets Bullish BTC Bull ($BTCBULL) is one of the best presales at the moment. It directly ties its fortunes to the value of Bitcoin. As the price of $BTC goes up, $BTCBULL token holders will get airdrop rewards. There are of course caveats to getting those airdrops. Token holders must buy $BTCBULL using Best Wallet , and hold the tokens there. When Bitcoin reaches price levels of $150K and $200K, holders of $BTCBULL will get Bitcoin airdrop rewards. When Bitcoin reaches $250K (which many investors believe is a very realistic possibility ), BTC Bull developers will release a large amount of $BTCBULL in airdrop rewards to celebrate. To hopefully make those $BTCBULL tokens more valuable, there will be token burns when the Bitcoin price reaches $125K, $175K, and $225K. With Bitcoin going through a golden era at the moment, the value of Bitcoin is likely going to increase again. If you buy $BTCBULL , you’ll get a double-dip of the profits. Today’s token price is $0.002415 and the staking APY is 115%. 2. Meme Index ($MEMEX) – Spread Your Risk with First-Ever Meme Coin Index Next up is Meme Index ($MEMEX) which ends its presale in two weeks. It’s a good altcoin to get into, as it provides $MEMEX token holders with exclusive access to four meme coin investment funds. The crypto markets can get rather choppy. Therefore, it’s hard to protect yourself against unexpected volatility, which could erase your gains in an instant. Meme Index solves this by spreading your money over 8 different coins in a fund. The four funds range in volatility, with the highest possible rewards being in the most volatile (the Frenzy Index). But if you want a more relaxed life, you can put your money into the Titan Index, followed by the Moonshot Index, and the Midcap Index. $MEMEX token holders also get voting and governance rights to influence the future direction of Meme Index. Today’s token price is $0.0166883 and the staking APY is 562%. Our $MEMEX price prediction sees the token price going as high as $1.75 a token by 2030, which is over a 100x price increase. 3. Heroes of Mavia ($MAVIA) – Get Airdrops Playing a Web3 Mobile Game Our spotlight on a promising new crypto today is Heroes of Mavia ($MAVIA) which is the in-game token for a Web3 mobile game and the token for the Heroes of Mavia gaming ecosystem . It caught our eye due to the price increasing in the past 24 hours by an eye-watering 2,900% and its market cap increasing 283% to just over $31M. Token holders can take part ownership of the game with voting and governance rights, as well as earning more $MAVIA tokens through airdrop rewards and playing tournaments. Tokens can also be used to buy NFTs in their marketplace. If you’re a gamer and you like the idea of holding a stake in an online game, this could be the one for you. It’s not a presale so there’s no staking APY. But the token price is a very attractive $0.5527. Do Your Own Research First! These are merely recommendations we’re making – not guarantees.

Since December 2024, ETH has lost over 57% of its value, failing to reclaim key resistance levels. With the broader crypto market facing macroeconomic uncertainty and persistent volatility, Ethereum’s downtrend appears far from over. Related Reading: 640,000 Chainlink (LINK) Withdrawn From Exchanges In 24 Hours – Bullish Accumulation? Despite the ongoing decline, on-chain data suggests that large investors may be positioning for a recovery. According to CryptoQuant, whales have moved over 130,000 ETH off exchanges in the past week, signaling a growing accumulation trend. This pattern has been developing since Ethereum started trending downward, suggesting that institutional players and long-term holders are buying the dip in anticipation of future price appreciation. While short-term sentiment remains bearish, historical data shows that large whale accumulations often precede strong rebounds once selling pressure fades. However, ETH still faces significant resistance, and bulls must reclaim key levels to confirm a potential trend reversal. With market uncertainty still looming, the next few weeks will be critical in determining Ethereum’s next major move. Ethereum Whale Activity Hints At Optimism Ethereum has been under massive selling pressure, struggling amid macroeconomic uncertainty and trade war fears that have shaken both the crypto market and the U.S. stock market. ETH is now trading below a multi-year support level, which could act as a strong resistance in the coming weeks. If bulls fail to reclaim key price levels, the stage could be set for a deeper correction. However, not all indicators are bearish. Despite the ongoing downtrend, some analysts remain optimistic about Ethereum’s long-term prospects. Top analyst Ali Martinez shared insights on X, revealing that whales have moved over 130,000 ETH off exchanges in the past week. This is significant because large investors typically move their holdings off exchanges when they plan to hold for the long term rather than selling. When whales transfer ETH into private wallets, it often signals accumulation rather than immediate selling pressure. Historically, such trends have preceded market rebounds, as reduced exchange supply can contribute to price stability and future upside potential. Related Reading: Whales Accumulate Over 150 Million XRP In Just 48 Hours – Is A Rally Incoming? While Ethereum still faces major hurdles, whale activity suggests that smart money is positioning itself for the next move. The next few weeks will be crucial in determining whether ETH can reverse its downward trend or if further declines are ahead. Bulls Fight to Hold Key Levels Ethereum is currently trading at $1,904, struggling to regain momentum after days of consolidation below the $2,000 mark. The ongoing selling pressure has kept ETH under key resistance, making it difficult for bulls to reverse the trend and start a recovery. For Ethereum to regain a bullish outlook, bulls must reclaim the $2,000 level as soon as possible. A sustained push above this resistance would signal strength and could set the stage for a rally toward higher levels, potentially testing $2,250–$2,400 in the coming weeks. However, if ETH loses current levels of demand, the next major liquidity zone sits around $1,600. A breakdown below $1,750 could trigger further sell-offs, leading to an extended bearish phase that could delay any potential recovery. Related Reading: Cardano Is ‘About To Break Free’ – Breakout Above Crucial Supply To Trigger A Big Move–Analyst With whale accumulation increasing and on-chain data suggesting reduced exchange supply, some analysts believe Ethereum could soon attempt a breakout. However, macroeconomic conditions and overall market sentiment remain critical factors in determining ETH’s short-term trajectory. Bulls will need strong buying pressure to reclaim lost ground and avoid a deeper decline.

According to CoinShares , withdrawals from digital asset investment products reached a fifth consecutive week, amounting to a staggering $6.4 billion over the period. Crypto ETFs & ETPs recorded another week of negative flows for the fifth consecutive time, with $1.7 billion in outflows! The outflows were significant for #Bitcoin products, totaling $978 million. Another notable asset was $BNB product, which saw $528 million in outflows. Last… pic.twitter.com/0T16cnVDhD — CoinShares (@CoinSharesCo) March 17, 2025 This downturn has been particularly severe in the United States, where investors pulled $1.16 billion in the last week alone, accounting for 93% of the total outflows. This marks the 17th consecutive day of declines, the longest in recorded history since CoinShares began tracking in 2015. Bitcoin has been the primary casualty, suffering a total outflow of $5.4 billion over five weeks. Ethereum and Solana ETFs have also seen significant declines, with respective outflows of $175 million and $2.2 million. Despite the grim performance, XRP has managed to buck the trend, recording $1.8 million in inflows. While the current market sentiment remains pessimistic, year-to-date inflows remain positive at $912 million. However, total assets under management (AuM) have plunged by $48 billion, highlighting the deep impact of this protracted selloff. The Underlying Factors Driving Massive Outflows Several factors have contributed to the sustained selling pressure on Bitcoin and other digital asset ETFs. A key driver has been the economic uncertainty fueled by recent policy announcements from former President Donald Trump. His proposed aggressive tariff policies have rattled financial markets, increasing concerns about inflation, interest rates, and risk asset valuations, which include cryptocurrencies. Additionally, the recent $1.4 billion hack on the Bybit exchange still has some investors expressing negative sentiments. Security concerns in cryptocurrency remain a significant deterrent for institutional investors, as high-profile breaches reinforce the risks associated with digital assets. The Federal Reserve’s ongoing hawkish stance has also weighed heavily on sentiment. The last comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell suggest that interest rates will remain elevated for an extended period, discouraging investment in speculative assets like Bitcoin. However, the decision coming this Wednesday might change the standing of FED’s point. FEDERAL RESERVE THIS WEEK: • FED INTEREST RATE DECISION (WED. 2:00PM ET) • FED FOMC STATEMENT (WED. 2:00PM ET) • FED FOMC DOT-PLOT (WED. 2:00PM ET) • FED CHAIR POWELL SPEAKS (WED. 2:30PM ET) $DIA $SPY $QQQ $VIX pic.twitter.com/1l5Nhe7Dut — Investing.com (@Investingcom) March 16, 2025 Profit-taking has also played a substantial role in the recent market downturn. Prior to this five-week selloff, Bitcoin ETFs experienced a 19-week inflow streak that brought in $2.9 billion on March 3. Many investors saw this as an opportunity to lock in profits before further market uncertainty set in, leading to the current cycle of redemptions. Additionally, a recent $300M short on Bitcoin adds to the speculation, making people question whether a further dip is coming. Market Reaction and Future Outlook The continuous outflows have led to significant downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price. Following the record ETP (exchange-traded product) outflows, Bitcoin fell to a four-month low of $78,197, marking a 27% decline from its all-time high of over $109,000. However, some investors see this as an opportunity to accumulate, as evidenced by Germany’s small but notable inflows exceeding $55 million. Prominent economist Peter Schiff has issued a warning, predicting that Bitcoin could face even steeper losses if the NASDAQ index continues to decline. Schiff argues that Bitcoin’s strong correlation with the tech-heavy index makes it particularly vulnerable. The NASDAQ is down 12%. If this correction turns out to be a bear market, and the correlation where a 12% decline in the NASDAQ equates to a 24% decline in Bitcoin holds, when the NASDAQ is down 20%, Bitcoin will be about $65K. But if the NASDAQ goes into a bear market, history… — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) March 16, 2025 He speculates that if the NASDAQ drops by 20%, Bitcoin could tumble to around $65,000. This outlook aligns with past market trends, where Bitcoin has mirrored stock market downturns rather than exhibiting the stability associated with traditional safe-haven assets like gold. Despite the current negative momentum, history suggests that Bitcoin and the broader crypto market have rebounded from similar selloffs. Institutional interest remains strong in the long run, and macroeconomic factors such as Federal Reserve policy shifts and potential regulatory clarity could influence the next phase of Bitcoin ETF flows. For now, however, investors remain cautious as they navigate the longest sustained outflow streak in Bitcoin ETF history.

The company disclosed that it acquired these assets between March 10 and March 16, at an average purchase price of $82,981 per BTC, for a total expenditure of $10.7 million. This latest acquisition increases Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to 499,226 BTC, reinforcing its position as one of the largest corporate Bitcoin holders. Michael Saylor’s Strategy Boosts Bitcoin Holdings to 499K With New Buy According to Strategy’s latest filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the company funded the Bitcoin acquisition through the sale of its Series A preferred stock. The firm sold 123,000 shares of its 8.00% Series A perpetual strike preferred stock (STRK Shares), generating approximately $10.7 million in net proceeds. Strategy confirmed that no Class A common stock was sold during the same period. This approach is consistent with the company’s recent financing strategies, allowing it to expand its Bitcoin portfolio without affecting its primary stock structure. With this latest acquisition, Strategy now holds 499,226 BTC, valued at more than $41.6 billion at current market prices. The company’s average purchase price across all acquisitions stands at $66,360 per BTC, inclusive of fees and expenses. Michael Saylor, the co-founder and executive chairman of Strategy, remains a strong advocate for Bitcoin as a long-term investment. However, despite Saylor’s BTC move, critics believe that gold will ultimately outperform Bitcoin as a long-term store of value.

Currently, trading at around $2.3 today, Ripple has survived against all odds despite continuous legal battles and variable market conditions. Investors are watching closely as XRP's performance closely mirrors that of the wider cryptocurrency market, which appears to be recovering. That being said, the sheer volatility of Ripple's price has convinced many investors to seek diversification and stability elsewhere. One of the contenders is Remittix, an innovative initiative that is quickly gathering pace for its innovative solution to cross-border payments. Ripple investors are on the lookout for shrewd hedges against market fluctuations, Remittix offers an interesting value proposition. Let us find out why. Ripple Price Is Riding Through Volatility Amid Market and Legal Strains XRP maintains its status as one of the most discussed cryptocurrencies because of its long-running SEC dispute. XRP has demonstrated resilience by maintaining its value at $2.28 after achieving a 4% price increase throughout last week. This is due to growing optimism regarding Ripple's chances of emerging victorious in a legal fight and its growing number of partnerships with financial institutions worldwide. Predictions for Ripple's price in 2025 range as wide as the board, with some anticipating a spike to $4.20 if the company succeeds in its lawsuit. Other analysts point to a falling channel that should see the price drop to as low as $2 soon. Ripple's commitment to providing scalable and effective payment solutions is still an institutional attraction, and as such, it is still a core asset for those looking to invest in utility-based cryptocurrencies. But XRP's inherent volatility also suggests the need to diversify into other emerging assets like Remittix and savvy investors are doing so due to Remittix being able to combine robust blockchain performance with real-world usability. Remittix Is Changing The Industry’s Approach To Cross-Border Payments The cryptocurrency industry analysts are touting Remittix as a disruptive force that is here to tackle existing cross-border remittance system problems. The platform uses blockchain technology to process payments between borders unlike traditional means that are slow and costly. Remittix success in presale is attributed to its healthy community and open tokenomicsmodel. The majority of the tokens are held for rewards to the community and liquidity pools to ensure stability in the long term while maximizing user-driven growth. Currently in presale, Remittix has already raised $13.9 million—a testament to its strong investor base and market appetite. The token is priced at $0.0734 at this point, providing a good entry opportunity for early birds to be included in exponential growth. Post-listing projections show that Remittix could achieve substantial profits within as little as one month of its listing on mainstream exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. In contrast to other traditional assets like Ripple or other utility tokens like Stellar Lumens (XLM), Remittix stands out in its clear-cut purpose of solving real-world problems with the help of blockchain technology and a legal framework with secure contracts audited by BlockSAFU. Secure Your Position in Remittix Today Is A Hedge For 100x Rewards Don't pay the price of uncertainty. The Ripple price rollercoaster is a reminder of the risks of betting on uncertainty, yet Remittix offers a clearly charted path forward with proven traction and real-world impact. Over $13.9 million raised and a growing ecosystem signal a break-out point—act today to secure your tokens before presale ends.

Responding to a question from Representative Cha Gyu-geun of the National Assembly’s Planning and Finance Committee, central bankers said that they have “neither discussed nor reviewed the possible inclusion of Bitcoin in foreign exchange reserves, adding that “a cautious approach is needed,” according to the Korea Herald. “Bitcoin’s price volatility is very high,” the central bank noted, before adding that “in the case of cryptocurrency market instability, transaction costs to cash out Bitcoins could rise drastically.” Jameson Lopp says we shouldn't allow quantum computers to restore lost BTC Jameson Lopp, chief security officer at Bitcoin ( BTC ) custody company Casa, recently argued that Quantum computers should not be used to restore lost BTC . According to a March 16 article from Lopp, allowing quantum computers to restore Bitcoin that was previously thought to be lost would violate the core value propositions of the network, including censorship resistance, transaction immutability, and conservatism. Lopp added: ""Does quantum recovery help anyone? I have yet to come across an argument that it is a net positive in any way. It certainly doesn't add any security to the network."" ""If anything, it greatly decreases the security of the network by allowing funds to be claimed by those who did not earn them,"" the executive continued. The cypherpunk and industry executive added to the ongoing debate about the potential for quantum computers to restore lost BTC after Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino pitched the idea in February.",Trump memecoin|Solana memecoin|TRUMP token|Solana|SOL|Nova Labs|SEC|Securities and Exchange Commission|crypto regulation|TRUMP rally|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|ICO|BCH|ETH|USDT|XRP|MATIC|ZK|ADA|TON|BNB|WLD|SOL|APT|ARB|AVAX|LINK|ASIA|MINING|USDC|FIAT|ARKM|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-03-17 13:32:35

Key Features of the Telegram’s Crypto Wallet Update According to the latest announcement, the new wallet upgrade includes: Multi-Asset Trading : Users can now trade various cryptocurrencies directly through the Telegram wallet, streamlining transactions within the app. Aiming to bring more tokens soon, it will allow users to trade hundreds of crypto coins , including ETH, XRP, DOGE, and PEPE, using USDT or TON and build portfolio — all via its wallet.

Soon, you’ll be able to trade hundreds of #crypto , including ETH, XRP, DOGE, and PEPE. Trade seamlessly using USDT or TON and build your portfolio — all in one place. pic.twitter.com/ROOIsfANH9 — Wallet in Telegram (@wallet_tg) March 13, 2025 Embracing Crypto Trading in Messaging Apps Telegram first introduced its official TON-based crypto wallet in September 2023, allowing users to send and store digital assets directly within the app. Since then, the wallet has seen continuous enhancements, with the latest upgrade offering multi-asset trading support. This feature enables users to trade different cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Toncoin (TON), without needing to leave the Telegram ecosystem. The integration of multi-asset trading aligns with Telegram’s broader push to bring decentralized finance (DeFi) tools to mainstream users. By simplifying crypto transactions and trading, Telegram aims to lower the barrier to entry for millions of users unfamiliar with traditional crypto exchanges. Industry experts suggest that the new features could challenge traditional exchanges and DeFi platforms by providing a more accessible and integrated trading experience. “Telegram’s move to enable multi-asset trading within its wallet is a game-changer. It reduces the need for external crypto exchanges and simplifies access to digital assets,” said a blockchain analyst from Coingape. What’s Next for Telegram’s Crypto Wallet? Telegram has hinted at further enhancements in the pipeline, including support for more cryptocurrencies, DeFi integrations, and staking options. The company is also reportedly exploring ways to integrate its wallet with other Web3 applications, further solidifying its position in the crypto industry. As competition in the blockchain space intensifies, Telegram’s move to expand its TON-based wallet with multi-asset trading positions it as a formidable player in the digital asset ecosystem. Whether this innovation will disrupt traditional crypto exchanges remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: Telegram is determined to push the boundaries of mainstream crypto adoption.

Despite facing turbulence—including market crashes, high-profile collapses, and network outages—Solana has emerged as one of the busiest chains in terms of transaction volume and decentralized finance (DeFi) activity. Since its inception, Solana has processed over 408 billion transactions and facilitated nearly $1 trillion in value on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). While the network debuted amid the COVID-19 pandemic, it quickly found backing from major venture capital firms and positioned itself as a serious challenger to Ethereum. From FTX Fallout to a Stunning Comeback The 2022 bear market was particularly brutal for SOL, with the collapse of FTX sending its price plummeting by 96%, wiping out billions in market value. The now-defunct exchange had invested heavily in Solana, holding 58 million SOL tokens—a stake that became a liability as FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy . By late 2022, SOL had crashed to just $8.30 per token. However, Solana staged a remarkable recovery in 2023 and 2024, fueled in part by the memecoin frenzy. The emergence of Solana-native tokens like Bonk, Dogwifhat (WIF), and Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) attracted a new wave of traders, propelling Solana’s market cap back above $140 billion by early 2025. The trend was further amplified by Pump.fun, a Solana-based memecoin launchpad , which generated over $540 million in revenue within a year. Adding to the momentum was Donald Trump’s involvement in crypto, as his campaign launched the TRUMP memecoin on SOL blockchain in early 2024. The token skyrocketed to a $14.6 billion valuation within two days, briefly making Solana the second-largest DeFi ecosystem after Ethereum. What’s Ahead for Solana? Beyond DeFi and memecoins, Solana has been pushing into hardware innovation with its Solana Saga and Seeker smartphones —designed for seamless crypto trading and Web3 integration. While initial sales were slow, a 30 million BONK airdrop dramatically boosted demand, leading to over 140,000 presales for the devices. Most notably, SOL is set to be included in Donald Trump’s Digital Asset Stockpile , according to a March 7 executive order. Though the U.S. government does not currently hold SOL, an audit of its crypto holdings is underway. Currently trading at $128.17, SOL ranks as the sixth-largest cryptocurrency with a $64.5 billion market cap.

Due to this, many whales have been periodically liquidating positions in Ripple (XRP) to invest in emerging projects and capitalize on the most rewarding opportunities. On-chain data shows that Ripple whales recently made an additional $1.65 million fund transfer to DTX Exchange, the most successful presale of the year. It has attracted seasoned investors by providing stable returns despite the slow market and the impressive 33.5% APY on staking the native tokens. DTX raised over $16 million in bearish market conditions, which highlights its potential to lead the next bull cycle. Many investors are joining the bonus presale round to obtain this undervalued token at $0.18 and make a 2x profit on its listing at $0.36. Can it outperform the XRP price? Let’s find out. Ripple Volatility Increases: What’s Next For The XRP Price? The XRP price has faced significant corrections in the past few months but has maintained above the $1.9 support. Ripple dropped again to this support last week after a month-long downtrend caused by a recent rejection from the All-Time High (ATH) price of $3.4. The price surged again after Trump revealed Ripple’s inclusion in the US Strategic Crypto Reserve. This announcement increased the XRP price momentum but also led to an increase in volatility. Ripple (XRP) shot up 34% on Sunday but lost more than half of these gains the following day due to profit booking. In the last three sessions, the XRP price has recovered remarkably and currently trades at $2.34 after a 5.07% intraday fall. It has crossed the 100-day SMA today, and the MACD oscillator indicates increasing bullish pressure. If bulls retain control, the XRP price can break out from immediate resistances at $2.65 and $3 to touch new peaks. DTX Exchange (DTX): Ready to Dominate Trading Exchange Space While the XRP price is facing extreme market volatility, DTX Exchange’s innovative decentralized trading platform has made news with the inclusion of more than 120,000 financial assets in a unified platform. The hybrid approach helps traders diversify over different asset classes, which balance risk according to macroeconomic cycles. To increase engagement and community growth, DTX has launched various loyalty programs. One highlight is the VIP Rebate Program, which helps traders earn up to a 3% profit share of trading revenue. Additionally, passive investors can stake their DTX tokens for up to 33.5% APY. Before the platform's launch, DTX Exchange already demonstrated its progress with the Phoenix Wallet. This is a non-custodial multi-asset storage solution that gives owners safe and full authority. Additionally, AI trading bots and automated investment managers will help traders and investors manage risk and develop tailored strategies according to different market conditions. With the increase in the listing price to $0.36, DTX Exchange has become a top choice for investors with its undervalued price of $0.18. This upgrade provides presale investors with 4x returns through the “LIST2X” promo code, which gives a 100% bonus on the discount. Early investors anticipate that its unique approach and high growth potential will draw in crypto natives together with mainstream traders. Final Thoughts The crypto market has the ability to provide explosive growth from time to time, and Ripple whales are capturing a similar opportunity with the DTX presale. DTX Exchange is introducing its advanced multi-asset trading to redefine the sector. Its passive income generation model is unique in the industry as token holders will benefit from price appreciation as well as the profit-sharing income.

However, most follow a similar centralized model. $HTX, launched just a year ago, is challenging this norm by introducing a decentralized governance approach. $HTX: Not Just Another Exchange Token Unlike traditional exchange tokens, $HTX is the governance token of HTX DAO , an independent decentralized organization. While it shares a name with HTX Exchange, it is not controlled by it. Instead, $HTX holders actively shape the ecosystem, proposing and voting on governance decisions. HTX DAO, launched in early 2024, aims to build a more transparent and decentralized digital economy. HTX Exchange supports $HTX’s utility but has no direct control over it. This is a stark contrast to tokens like BNB or OKB, which are fully controlled by their respective exchanges. Decentralizing the Governance of a Centralized Exchange HTX DAO’s ambition is bold: Can a DAO influence a centralized exchange’s decision-making? According to CoinDesk , the HTX DAO empowers token holders to shape the future of the platform by participating in its governance. This is an invitation to people who have come to rely on the platform to get involved, stay engaged, and keep the day-to-day management transparent and hold them accountable. To encourage governance participation, HTX DAO allows $HTX holders to propose and vote on decisions that could impact HTX Exchange’s operations. Governance discussions include token listings, fee structures, and product enhancements. If a proposal gains traction, it has the potential to be implemented by the exchange. Beyond governance, HTX Exchange integrates incentives for $HTX holders, including: Trading fee discounts Launchpool participation (staking for rewards) Exclusive privileges for ecosystem engagement A standout example is Launchpool, introduced in December 2024. This initiative—originating from an HTX DAO governance proposal—allows users to stake $HTX and earn dual rewards, demonstrating how DAO-driven innovation can shape real-world exchange features. The Future of DAO-Governed Exchanges HTX DAO is still young, and transitioning a centralized exchange toward decentralized governance will take time. However, early experiments like Launchpool and governance-driven discussions show real potential. Recent proposals include optimizing the token listing process and refining governance mechanics. As more users participate, HTX DAO could redefine how exchanges operate, moving power from corporate leadership to the community. For HTX Exchange, this is more than an experiment—it’s a vision. By allowing the community to co-govern exchange operations, HTX DAO aims to create a truly “people’s exchange.” $HTX: A New Era of Exchange Tokens Unlike traditional exchange tokens that serve as mere discount tools, $HTX is a governance asset that actively influences an ecosystem. Since its launch, $HTX has been listed on 28 exchanges, reflecting growing recognition. As its unique governance model gains traction, broader adoption is inevitable. As CoinDesk put it, “While all exchange tokens have the same purpose, they don’t all behave the same or offer the same range of benefits. The HTX token, though, seems to check all the boxes: Community empowerment and decentralized governance Interest-bearing rewards for staking the asset Token burns to support the coin’s value Exclusive access, benefits, and privileges to token holders.” If BNB defined the first generation of exchange tokens, $HTX is leading the next wave—where governance and decentralization take center stage.

With geopolitical tensions influencing investor sentiment, crypto price movements could see significant volatility. Will a breakthrough in negotiations spark a bullish surge, or will uncertainty keep prices fluctuating? Cryptocurrencies Price in Focus Ahead of Trump-Putin Talks on Ukraine According to Bloomberg, President Trump is scheduled to speak with Putin on Tuesday and has expressed optimism about a possible resolution to the Russia-Ukraine war. He stated there is a “very good chance” of reaching a positive outcome. However, White House officials, including National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, have acknowledged major hurdles in achieving a ceasefire. Geopolitical uncertainty often weakens the price of risk assets like cryptocurrencies and stocks. Therefore, if there is a breakthrough in the matter, it could be bullish for Bitcoin and altcoins. At press time, traders appear skeptical of a peaceful resolution to the war. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures have declined as analysts flip bearish on the US stock market. Bitcoin price has also dropped slightly by 1.3% to around $83,600. Russia-Ukraine Deal is Bad for US Dollar But Good For Crypto The end of the Russia-Ukraine war may be bad for the US dollar, which is already underperforming against other major currencies due to Trump’s tariff war. However, a weaker US dollar will be good for cryptocurrencies price as traders seek out other safe havens. Trump’s tariff war has stirred economic uncertainty and reduced reliance on the dollar. Meanwhile, the possibility of the end of the Russia-Ukraine war has boosted the price of European currencies, leading to the US dollar index falling to a five-month low. US Dollar Index If investors anticipate a short-term weakening of the US dollar, it may lead to capital rotation into cryptocurrencies as traders hedge against currency devaluation, leading to higher price moves. Will Trump-Putin Meeting Push Bitcoin Price to $90,000? Bitcoin price trades at $83,065 today with a marginal 0.5% increase in 24 hours. BTC is at a pivotal point where a breakout from a symmetrical triangle pattern on the four-hour price chart will determine the next move. Crypto analyst Carl Moon notes that if BTC breaks above the upper trendline of this triangle, it could trigger a bullish Bitcoin price prediction and a 12% rally toward $94,000. This rally could be supported by a successful outcome from Tuesday’s meeting, leading to price gains across the cryptocurrencies market. Conversely, if this uptrend fails and BTC price drops, it will result in another downtrend, possibly to the $72,000 price level. BTC/USDT: 4-Hour Chart Besides the bullish technical outlook, whales also seem to be accumulating BTC. This follows the recent purchase of $10M Bitcoin by MicroStrategy. This suggests whale positioning ahead of the Trump-Putin meeting.

Meanwhile, last February, TRON founder Justin Sun was entangled in a legal dispute with David Geffen over the sale of Alberto Giacometti’s sculpture “Le Nez.” Sun alleges the sculpture was sold without authorization via a crypto wallet transfer and the use of forged documents.

41810805,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=713312,1742218977,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/41810805.jpeg,"Home of The Best Meme Coins, Solana, Turns Five",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana-turns-5/,"Solana celebrated its 5th birthday yesterday. In honour of the occasion, we decided to take a look at this blockchain’s journey to becoming a leading platform and the home of the best meme coins. Solana was launched on March 16, 2020, by Solana Labs CEO Anatoly Yakovenko and Solana co-founder Raj Gokal and his team. That was right around the time the entire world was forced into lockdown by the COVID-19 pandemic. Some 408B transactions and close to $1T in trading on DEXs later, today Solana is second only to Ethereum in terms of total value locked, at $6.85B. Solana was designed to address the scalability issues that plagued the likes of the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains. And, over the past five years, it has been widely adopted in areas such as DeFi, NFTs, gaming, Web3 applications, and – of course – as the launchpad for some of the best meme coins . The high-speed, low-cost Layer 1 blockchain has had its fair share of ups and downs over the past five years. At the peak of the 2020–2021 bull run, Solana’s market cap surged to $77.8B. However, it plummeted by a massive 96% in late 2022. The Solana price fell to $8.30, and its market cap bottomed out at around $3B. Yet, Solana has proven quite the comeback kid, thanks in large part to the meme coin craze. Last year, the meme coin market exploded, and its collective market cap grew by 330%, according to CEX.io . Solana’s impressive speed (up to 65K transactions per second), low costs, strong community, and developer-friendly environment have made it the go-to blockchain for the best altcoins , giving it a considerable edge over competitors. Solana Back On Track For A Good Year Ahead As Solana celebrates its 5th birthday, it seems good things are in store for this blockchain. For one, US President Donald Trump recently announced $SOL will be included in the country’s proposed strategic reserve. Institutional players are acknowledging Solana’s strong position – with the likes of asset manager BlackRock on the brink of launching $SOL spot ETFs . Solana also has two protocol upgrades in the pipeline. The first, SIMD 0123, proposes a system whereby Solana’s priority fees go to validator stakers. This should boost staking rewards, block off-chain transactions, and improve on-chain processing. SIMD 0228, meanwhile, is a proposal to change how new $SOL tokens are released, in a bid to make token issuance more balanced and efficient. Instead of a fixed schedule, staking rewards would adjust based on how many people are staking. The Solaxy Presale Solution To Solana’s Pitfalls Solana’s ecosystem continues to flourish in the cryptocurrency and Web3 landscape, proving that speed, efficiency, and innovation can co-exist in a decentralized world. That said, the Solana blockchain is still known for traffic congestion and failed transactions. To the rescue comes Solaxy ($SOLX) , the meme coin behind the world’s first-ever Solana Layer 2 ecosystem. $SOLX aims to build on Solana’s good points (speed and low transaction costs) by boosting scalability and adding even more speed. As an Ethereum-based token, Solaxy will bridge Solana and Ethereum, meaning $SOLX holders will be able to capitalize on the strength of these two blockchain powerhouses. This is exciting news for the crypto world, and investors are taking note. The Solaxy presale has raised $26.7M since it launched in December last year. Right now, 1 $SOLX costs $0.0016666 (with 153% staking rewards). Being a presale, however, it won’t stay that low for long. If you’re interested in investing in what is potentially a game changer for Solana, the Solaxy whitepaper is a good starting point, as is the $SOLX X channel . Our guide to buying $SOLX will walk you through the steps if you decide this is the investment for you. Remember to do your own research, as we’re not financial advisers. That said, it will be exciting to see what’s in store for the Solana blockchain if the last five years are anything to go by.",Cryptocurrency Market News,EN,0,0,SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|ETH|FORKS,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-03-17 13:42:57

XRP and SOL are still established players, but RTX is quickly emerging as a true real-world financial solution. With only 100 days left to go, how much can $500 invested in this token make? Investors consider XRP and SOL and bring RTX into the equation as they seek the best balance between stability and adoption and potential upside. Will Remittix (RTX) overtake XRP and SOL in the coming months? XRP’s Growth Potential Over the Next 100 Days XRP currently trades at $2.30 and has decreased by 5.09%. It remained at $134.19 billion in market cap and decreased 30.09% in the volume of trades to $3.24 billion as it took a short-term plunge in market movement. Source: Tradingview Despite short-term fluctuations in the price, XRP remains a blockchain payment leader. XRP will recover with improved regulatory transparency and is accordingly still an excellent option for consistent return in the next few weeks and days. $500 invested in XRP can yield good profits if adoption grows in the next 100 days. Since XRP remains on top in institutional finance, it remains a favourite among investors looking for stability in the longer term. Solana’s Market Position and Expected Growth Solana (SOL) dropped by 3.30% and is currently at $129.88. It has a market capitalization of $66.09 billion and its trading volume decreased by 39.48% to $1.95 billion, an indicator of market uncertainty. Source: Tradingview Although there have been recent setbacks in price, Solana is still a speedy blockchain with widespread use in DeFi, gaming, and NFTs. With its speedy processing and low-fee systems in place, most think SOL could have great gains in the next market upturn. If Solana recovers over the next 100 days, a $500 stake could rack up enormous gains, especially if institutional adoption surges. However, most investors are looking at Remittix (RTX) as another play on growth. Remittix (RTX): The Crypto Payment Solution Set for Explosive Gains Remittix (RTX) is also quickly proving itself to be a leader in blockchain payments with instantaneous, no-cost crypto-fiat transfers. Listed at $0.0734, it has already raised $13.9 million+ and sold 520 million+ tokens, reflecting strong demand in the markets. In contrast to XRP and SOL, which focus on institutional and DeFi use cases, RTX is focused on day-to-day financial transactions. RTX can be used by a freelancer from Europe with foreign clients for seamless payment transfers without costly bank commissions and delays. With its PayFi platform, RTX will be a force to be reckoned with in the world of digital finance and might yield higher percentage gains over XRP and SOL over the next 100 days. Which Crypto Could Deliver the Best ROI? When investors are looking at XRP, Solana (SOL), and Remittix (RTX), the point to consider remains growth opportunities and real-world adoption. XRP remains a transactional giant, and institutional partnerships and cross-border payment services work in its favor. But regulatory issues could cap XRP’s near-future gains, and thus some investors are apprehensive of its near-future behavior. Solana remains a leading smart contract platform, with developers attracted by use in DeFi, NFTs, and gaming applications. Despite its solid underpinnings, however, SOL remains extremely volatile, driven by market sentiment and network stability concerns. With increasing competition in the blockchain sector, investors are looking at alternatives with a promise of stability as much as exponential growth prospects. Invest in the Future of Crypto Payments with Remittix (RTX) While XRP and SOL are preparing for possible comebacks, RTX is emerging as a strong contender in the blockchain payments space. Investors who want to profit from high-growth prospects are snapping up RTX tokens before the presale closes. Briefly speaking, despite XRP and SOL leading the pack, the real-world practical applications of RTX could have it as the most rewarding 100-day bet. With investors looking for maximum return on their investments, RTX becomes a prime contender in the field of digital payments. Considering investing in the next big thing in blockchain?

Firedancer upgrade deployment begins, promising a more robust and faster network. Despite a dip, Solana still leads in decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes and revenue.

The report slashes growth forecasts for nearly all major economies in 2025 and 2026. The report now projects Mexico’s economy to shrink by 1.3% this year and 0.6% in 2026, a huge reversal from earlier estimates that had Mexico growing by 1.2% and 2.8%. Canada’s growth forecast was cut to 0.7% for both 2025 and 2026, down from 2% previously. The U.S. economy is also expected to slow, with growth now pegged at 2.2% this year and 1.6% next year, lower than the earlier 2.4% and 2.1% projections. Both countries are victims of Trump’s aggressive tariffs. Tariffs to rise, trade partners to face heavy costs The OECD’s forecast assumes that tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada will rise by 25 percentage points starting next month. China will continue to face 20 percentage point tariffs on its exports to the U.S., along with higher duties on steel and aluminum. In its Monday report, the OECD warned that Trump’s trade policies would likely lead to retaliation from affected countries, which would further damage the global economy. Alvaro Pereira, OECD’s chief economist, pointed out how the uncertainty surrounding Trump’s trade policies is already affecting global markets. “We’re already seeing high trade uncertainty and economic policy uncertainty,” Pereira said. “This is already having an impact on confidence. We have downgraded almost every single country.” The global economy is now forecast to grow by 3.1% in 2025 and 3% in 2026, slightly down from previous estimates of 3.3% for both years, according to the OECD’s report. Inflation and U.S. households to take a hit If Trump imposes new tariffs of 10 percentage points and other nations respond with their own trade barriers, the OECD projects that global economic output will shrink by 0.3% in 2026. The report also warns that these policies will drive up consumer prices, cutting real incomes in the U.S. by 1.25% over the next three years. That translates to an average $1,600 loss per household. Despite generating additional tariff revenue for the U.S. government, the OECD says that the economic slowdown will reduce tax revenue from other sources, making it unlikely that tariffs will cover the losses. “Additional tax increases or lower fiscal expenditure are needed to keep the overall budget deficit unchanged,” the OECD stated. Inflation is expected to rise by a third of a percentage point across the world’s largest economies due to Trump’s tariffs , which could cause central banks to delay interest rate cuts. Pereira said that if inflation worsens, central banks will be forced to take a cautious approach in their decision-making. The OECD now expects the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates at 4.25% to 4.5% well into 2026, a shift from its earlier forecast that had rates dropping to 3.25% to 3.5% by early 2026. China sees small boost, eurozone struggles The OECD slightly raised its growth forecast for China, now predicting 4.8% growth in 2025, up from 4.7% previously. The group says that China’s economic stimulus measures will help offset the impact of U.S. tariffs on Chinese exports. Meanwhile, growth forecasts for the eurozone and Germany were lowered. However, the OECD noted that its projections do not yet reflect expected increases in Germany’s defense and infrastructure spending under incoming leadership. The government led by Friedrich Merz is set to expand spending on infrastructure, which could improve the outlook for Europe’s largest economy. “Germany has had an infrastructure gap for a long time,” said Pereira. “They definitely need to spend more.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

CZ Sparks Speculations,https://coingape.com/is-north-korea-pushing-for-bitcoin-reserve-cz-sparks-speculations/,"In a recent development, North Korea has flipped Bhutan and El Salvador in crypto holdings, becoming the fourth largest Bitcoin holder. Reflecting on the development, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) sparked speculations about North Korea’s Bitcoin reserve plans. Significantly, North Korea’s ascend in Bitcoin holdings follows the notorious Lazarus Group’s Bybit hack. Though the hackers stole $1.4 billion in ETH, the latest reports reveal that the group converted most of the stolen funds to BTC. CZ Teases North Korea’s Bitcoin Reserve Plans As North Korea has become the fourth largest country in terms of Bitcoin holdings, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao hints at the country’s potential Bitcoin reserve adoption. In a playful manner, CZ shared an X post , commenting, “Different ways to build a strategic crypto reserve.” Notably, the addition of an emoji of hysterical laughter in his post could convey his extreme surprise at the development. He humorously suggests that North Korea’s BTC accumulation is an unconventional yet effective way to build a strategic Bitcoin reserve. This could also imply the irony that a country like North Korea, often viewed as isolated, is actively building a significant Bitcoin reserve. North Korea Accumulates Bitcoin: What Does It Mean? According to Arkham Intelligence, Lazarus Group, the notorious hackers of North Korea, currently holds a total of 13,518 BTC. As of Bitcoin’s current price of $83,263, North Korea’s BTC holding is valued at a staggering $1.13 billion. Notably, the US is the largest holder of Bitcoin with a total of 198,109 BTC ($16.47 billion). Closely following are China and the United Kingdom, boasting 195,000 BTC (16.18 billion) and 61,245 BTC ($5.1 billion), respectively. Previously, El Salvador and Bhutan secured the fourth and fifth positions with Bitcoin holdings of 10,634 BTC ($886 million) and 6,118 BTC ($509.5 million), respectively. Following the $1.4 billion Bybit hack , North Korea jumped to the fourth place, overtaking Bhutan and El Salvador. Despite reportedly rising to third place, North Korea’s cryptocurrency holdings actually rank fourth, trailing behind those of the United States, China, and the United Kingdom. This has sparked speculations of North Korea’s potential Bitcoin reserve strategy, further fueled by Changpeng Zhao’s comments. Is North Korea Embracing Bitcoin Reserve? Surprisingly, the coincidence in North Korea’s rise in BTC holdings and the US’ Bitcoin reserve adoption has raised speculations. The cryptocurrency community is puzzled as to why the Lazarus Group chose to convert the pilfered funds into BTC. Meanwhile, Changpeng Zhao’s comments intensified anticipations of North Korea’s possible Bitcoin reserve adoption. Meanwhile, the Bank of Korea rejected the idea of adopting the Bitcoin reserve in opposition to South Korea lawmakers’ proposal. The BoK stated, “In the case of cryptocurrency market instability, transaction costs to cash out Bitcoins could rise drastically.” The post Is North Korea Pushing For Bitcoin Reserve?

Ripple ( XRP ) ose largely due to last week’s rebound in the crypto and stock markets. Top U.S. indices like the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq 100 each gained more than 1.5% on Friday. XRP also jumped on growing optimism that the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve a spot ETF rose. Polymarket data shows that the odds of approval have risen to 76%. A spot XRP ETF would likely attract more inflows from Wall Street investors. There is also speculation that the SEC will drop its lawsuit against Ripple Labs. This would benefit the company by allowing its management to secure more deals with banks and other financial institutions in the money transfer industry. Ripple Labs hopes these deals will strengthen its position against SWIFT, which handles over $150 trillion in transactions annually. Further, XRP price has jumped as some whales continue to accumulate the coin. One such whale spent $24.2 million to buy 10.3 million tokens on Bitfinex on Monday. Whale accumulation is one of the top indicators in crypto fundamental analysis.

This level is significant because Ripple has failed to drop below that price several times since December. The only successful breach happened on February 3, which turned out to be a false breakout. The $1.9447 level also serves as the neckline of a head-and-shoulders pattern that has been forming since November. Its head section is at $3.40, while the left and right shoulders are at $3.00. Therefore, a drop below $1.9445, which also aligns with the 200-day moving average, could signal further losses, potentially driving XRP down to the psychological support at $1.00. XRP bulls need to push the price above the right shoulder at $3.00 to invalidate the head-and-shoulders pattern. If this happens, the next level to watch will be $3.40, the highest level this year.

This feat, according to data by ICODrops, places the project among the top 10 biggest token raises in history. One of the major investors in the ICO is Tron’s Justin Sun who purchased $30 million worth of WLFI in late November. Well-known investment platforms like Web3Port and Oddiyana Ventures were also among the top participants in the sales event. While the token raise event is now done and dusted, its success has already ignited a fresh wave of FOMO across the crypto market, with more investors now eyeing the next best crypto presales that could deliver much like the growth anticipated for WLFI. World Liberty Financial Token Completely Sold Out Despite Sluggish Start WLFI is currently trending in multiple crypto news following the completion of its blockbuster token raise campaign. It was introduced in mid-October 2024 as the governance token of World Liberty Financial—a DeFi lending platform supporting the adoption of dollar-pegged stablecoins. This platform was launched barely a month to the commencement of the token raise event and it immediately received the endorsement of Donald Trump—who was still a candidate for the White House job at that time. World Liberty Financial quickly hit the ground running, engaging in strategic collaborations with prominent names in the industry like Sui. The project has also made headlines for its recent crypto buying spree. However, its governance token WLFI—unlike traditional presales—was only made available to accredited investors, with temporary restrictions preventing public trading or transfers. The token didn’t really see much demand at the earliest stage of its raise event, with only 776 million tokens out of the initial 20 billion allocation sold as of early November 2024. But things changed positively for WLFI, especially after Sun’s $30 million investment in late November. The heightened interest around Official Trump Meme and Melania Meme also played a significant role in creating peaked investor interest in the token. And by January 20, the project had completely sold out all the 20 billion tokens allocated to the presale, netting its exact fundraising target of $300 million. Nonetheless, the demand kept increasing, and this left the project with no choice but to issue an additional 5 billion tokens through another round of sales. The second sale event came to a close on March 14 with $290 million raised—making a grand total of $590 million. Considering the fact that this huge amount of money was raised amid the aggressive volatility in the broader market, it won't be surprising to see WLFI get on to a strong start once it eventually arrives on exchanges. However, those who missed out on WLFI during its token sale stage have absolutely nothing to worry about as there are still plenty of similar opportunities in town—offering an early-moving chance to secure massive returns. In this article, our experts curated a list of active presales that, much like WLFI, have shown the potential to explosive growth once they hit exchanges. Best Crypto Presales To Buy Now BTC Bull While Bitcoin is still far from its recent highs due to Donald Trump’s trade war chaos, many experts, including Samson Mow, CEO of JAN3 , are still of the opinion that the premier cryptocurrency will touch the monumental $1 million milestone even earlier than anticipated. What formed the basis of Mow’s prediction is the increasing involvement of countries in Bitcoin mining initiatives—a development he described in his recent interview as “hyperbitcoinization.” His belief is that this factor alongside the final arrival of the eagerly-anticipated reserve in the United States could result in sudden growth for Bitcoin in 2025, potentially pushing it to new heights. With several other projections also pointing in that direction, those seeking to fully capitalize on Bitcoin’s explosive growth potential at relatively lower costs should turn to BTC Bull —a new meme coin themed around BTC’s upward trajectory. This project was launched as a presale at a time when Bitcoin reached $100k to give a chance to retail investors to benefit from the cryptocurrency’s future growth. Whenever Bitcoin achieves each of the milestones specified in its roadmap, free BTC airdrops and token burns will be unlocked. Bitcoin reaching $125k, for instance, will unlock the token burn, while a free Bitcoin airdrop will happen when the $150k level is achieved. The allure of free Bitcoin airdrops, coupled with the staking perks offered by the project, has made BTC Bull the best presale crypto to consider following the conclusion of WLFI’s ICO. Over $3.6 million has been raised already, which means investors find strong potential in the token. And as the community anticipates a prolonged rally that will propel the price of BTC to new heights, NASS Crypto has told his 1 million YouTube subscribers that the BTCBULL presale could be the best bet to reap the benefits of the bull run. MIND of Pepe In spite of the multiple ups and downs in the broader market, the FOMO vibe around MIND of Pepe has been strong. In fact, it is currently among the most sought-after crypto presales, raising upwards of $7.3 million to date. One major factor that has been fueling the increasing market demand for this meme coin is its integration of a meaningful AI utility. Unlike most meme coins that lack practical innovation, MIND of Pepe seamlessly taps into the AI agent meta-narrative without sacrificing its Pepe-based fundamentals. AI remains one of the hottest niches in the crypto industry, and when combined with the viral appeal of meme coins, it creates a powerful innovation that could result in rapid growth. MIND of Pepe has already shown that it is not just another meme-driven crypto by integrating AI, which is why it has continued to see heightened demand since landing on presale. Its self-evolving AI agent will soon go live, allowing it to function as an active market participant rather than just a passive asset. It will leverage hive-mind analysis as well as real-time intelligence to analyze market sentiment and provide investors with the best early-moving investment opportunities. The AI-driven agent will also be active on social media platforms such as Telegram and X, influencing trends, sparking discussions about meme coins, and delivering exclusive alpha calls. In addition to this, $MIND will serve as a launchpad, providing an opportunity for token holders to create their own meme coins using simple prompts. Staking is another core feature highlighted by the project. Those who lock their tokens within the ecosystem will benefit from its dynamic yet lucrative reward structure, further enhancing early adoption and community loyalty. As the market edges closer to full recovery, projects that align with strong trends like AI and meme coins have an edge in maintaining relevance than others. And this is the reason why prominent names in the industry, including ClayBro, believe MIND of Pepe could be positioned for a strong surge by the time it arrives on exchanges. Best Wallet Token Best Wallet Token continues to be one of the most suitable alternatives for those who missed out on the recently concluded WLFI token raise campaign. Being a cryptocurrency powering Best Wallet —a multichain, multi-wallet, and non-custodial wallet solution packed with industry-leading features—Best Wallet Token provides enhanced accessibility alongside special perks like low transaction fees, higher yield staking opportunities, and even earlier access to promising stage 0 projects. What sets Best Wallet apart from other non-custodial wallet solutions is the fact that it offers more than just the usual functionalities. Its major selling point is its intuitive facility that allows investors to buy and sell thousands of cryptocurrencies using fiat. It has already integrated multiple on-ramp and off-ramp third-party service providers, ensuring that users find the best rates and the lowest overall fees. Other than that, Best Wallet also provides staking opportunities, iGaming perks, market insights, portfolio management, and even a token launchpad—all within its app. The token launchpad facility, otherwise known as “Upcoming Tokens” has gained the most attention due to its consistency in providing presale hunters with the best crypto ICOs before they are launched to the public. The platform also highlights maximum security as its core priority and has integrated cutting-edge technologies like Fireblocks to ensure full protection of users and their funds. More so, being a multichain wallet, Best Wallet currently supports four major chains—Ethereum, Bitcoin, BNB Smart Chain, and Polygon—with plans to add more soon. Best Wallet Token has been designed to enhance all the aforementioned features—which is another reason why it could be a good idea to invest in the project. The multiple perks and utilities tied to the new crypto have already caught the attention of leading YouTubers including Cilinix Crypto, who recently listed it one of the best early-moving opportunities on the market right now. So far, it has raised over $11 million, further elevating its position among the most in-demand crypto presales of Q1 2025. Solaxy Solaxy is yet another top contender for the best crypto presales to buy now. Unlike most ICOs struggling to raise enough capital amid the prevailing market uncertainty, this project keeps gaining momentum, securing upwards of $26.5 million to date—a testament to its popularity among smart money investors. Solaxy’s strong start is no surprise, considering its strategic positioning as the world’s first Layer-2 chain on Solana. Dubbed by several experts as a beta bet on Solana, the whole idea around Solaxy is to make the Layer-1 chain more accessible, scalable, and inclusive. The developments it plans to introduce will address major pain points of Solana, especially network congestion, downtime, and scalability limitations while maintaining its security. A modular platform that will streamline the process of building decentralized apps will also be created, making Solana even more attractive to developers. Another core focus of Solaxy is achieving seamless network interoperability—an attribute that further distinguishes it from traditional Layer-2 solutions. Rather than widening the rivalry between Solana and Ethereum, it brings both chains together to deliver smoother and more efficient multichain transactions. This particular aspect of the project elevates its appeal as an ideal destination for all kinds of protocols and apps that flourish on seamless cross-chain functionality. Further enhancing its visibility is its staking option, which offers a simple way for investors to optimize their returns. The success of its ongoing presale is a reflection of investor confidence in its ability to solve pressing issues in the crypto space. And as it begins to roll out all the plans in its roadmap, Alessandro De Crypto—an influential crypto analyst—says Solaxy could be poised for long-term growth. Meme Index Meme Index started trending as soon as it arrived on presale, thanks to its focus on providing the first-ever decentralized meme coin indices. While meme coins have gained traction as assets that could generate immense wealth within a short timeframe, indices offering an avenue to invest in multiple tokens at a go are largely centralized. Meme Index counters this issue head-on by creating multiple indices that will be rebalanced through community feedback. The indices it plans to launch are four in number—Titan Index, Moonshot Index, Midcap Index, and Frenzy Index—allowing people of varying risk-taking propensity to smash the volatile yet rewarding meme coin market. The Titan Index contains large-cap meme assets like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe which are considered safe plays for those looking for relatively stable investment options. The Moonshot Index features tokens that have barely touched a $1 billion market cap, and they may or may not have arrived on tier-1 exchanges. Next is the Midcap Index, containing assets that are trying to become the next moonshot cryptos. Meme tokens in this category have between $50 million and $250 million market caps, making it a suitable option for those who do not mind a bit of risk. And for those eyeing explosive returns through the most volatile meme coins, the Frenzy Index is the most suitable option. The multilayered structure of its use cases alongside its staking perks have helped it raise over $4 million at press time, and with just two weeks to the end of the presale, prominent voices in the industry have started discussing its potential to deliver massive returns. Conclusion While no date has been given yet for WLFI’s exchange debut, the success of its token raise campaign has already prompted many to search for the next best crypto presales to buy now. The projects highlighted in this article have shown that they have similar growth potential with WLFI, thanks to their strong community backing and robust use cases. BTC Bull offers a simple way for investors to reap the benefits of BTC’s growth, MIND of Pepe delivers exclusive market insights alongside staking perks, Best Wallet Token guarantees multiple wallet-driven perks, Meme Index helps streamline the process of diversifying meme coin investments, and Solaxy provides a faster, cheaper, and more scalable infrastructure for blockchain transactions.

In South Korea, the Bank of Korea has reaffirmed its cautious stance on including Bitcoin in its foreign exchange reserves, citing concerns over volatility and liquidity. Meanwhile, Bitcoin security expert Jameson Lopp has warned against the potential use of quantum computing to recover lost BTC, arguing that such a move could undermine the network’s core principles of immutability and decentralization. Bank of Korea Maintains Skepticism on Bitcoin Reserves Despite Global Shifts The Bank of Korea (BOK) has reaffirmed its cautious stance regarding the potential inclusion of Bitcoin (BTC) in its foreign exchange reserves, citing concerns over high volatility and liquidity risks. The statement, made in response to a March 16 written inquiry from Representative Cha Gyu-geun of the National Assembly’s Planning and Finance Committee, shows the country’s reluctance to follow in the footsteps of other nations exploring crypto-backed reserves. Despite Bitcoin's increasing institutional adoption and global discussions around its role in national financial strategies, the South Korean central bank has yet to formally explore or deliberate on adding BTC to its foreign reserves. According to the Korea Herald , the BOK emphasized the need for a ”cautious approach”, pointing out Bitcoin’s price instability and its potential impact on transaction costs during periods of market turbulence. This stance is consistent with South Korea’s historically measured approach to cryptocurrency regulation, despite the country’s status as one of the most active crypto markets globally. Bitcoin’s price action over the past month has likely reinforced the BOK’s skepticism. Over the past 30 days, BTC has fluctuated significantly, reaching a high of $98,000 before dipping to $76,000, ultimately stabilizing around $83,000—marking a 15% decline since Feb. 16, according to CoinGecko. These price movements highlight the extreme volatility that has long been a concern for regulators and policymakers, particularly when considering Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Unlike traditional fiat reserves such as the US dollar (USD), euro (EUR), or Japanese yen (JPY), Bitcoin does not yet possess the same level of stability or universal acceptance for central banking functions. The Bank of Korea’s reluctance to embrace Bitcoin stands in contrast to a growing trend among global policymakers who are increasingly considering digital assets as part of their financial reserves. Earlier this month, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order directing federal agencies to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve and a broader digital asset stockpile, a move that sent shockwaves through both traditional financial institutions and the crypto market. The initiative signals a growing recognition of Bitcoin’s potential role in global finance, particularly as a hedge against fiat currency devaluation. In response to Trump’s decision, prominent South Korean crypto industry leaders and some Democratic Party members have called on the government to take proactive steps in integrating Bitcoin into the country’s reserves. At a seminar on March 6, these advocates pushed for both BTC integration and the development of a won-backed stablecoin, which they argue would enhance South Korea’s financial sovereignty in an increasingly digital global economy. Despite the ongoing debate, the Bank of Korea remains firm in its position that foreign exchange reserves must meet strict liquidity and credit rating criteria, which, in its view, Bitcoin does not currently satisfy. This perspective aligns with traditional reserve management policies, which prioritize assets that can be quickly liquidated in times of economic uncertainty. Bitcoin, due to its decentralized nature and relatively low daily trading volume compared to fiat markets, does not yet meet these criteria. As the global financial landscape evolves, some experts argue that stablecoins—cryptocurrencies pegged to fiat currencies—could emerge as a more viable option for foreign reserves than Bitcoin itself. Professor Kang Tae-soo from the KAIST Graduate School of Finance believes that the US will likely leverage stablecoins rather than BTC to maintain the dollar’s global dominance. He further emphasized that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) may eventually recognize stablecoins as part of official foreign exchange reserves, a development that could significantly impact how central banks approach digital assets. If the IMF were to take such a step, it could pave the way for South Korea and other major economies to reconsider their approach to digital assets in a way that aligns with traditional financial safeguards. South Korea’s Regulatory Landscape Remains Uncertain While the Bank of Korea remains cautious, South Korea’s broader regulatory landscape is shifting. Earlier this month, the country’s financial watchdogs reviewed Japan’s approach to digital asset regulation, including the Japanese Financial Services Agency’s move toward potential crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs). South Korea has historically taken a conservative stance on crypto-related financial products, banning crypto ETFs and certain derivatives in 2021. However, with Japan reconsidering its stance, there is speculation that South Korea may follow suit, particularly as other nations—including the United States and Canada—move forward with regulated crypto investment products. Despite mounting global momentum for Bitcoin reserves and crypto integration, South Korea remains on the sidelines. While some policymakers and industry leaders push for a more progressive approach, the Bank of Korea’s strict requirements for liquidity and stability continue to pose a barrier to Bitcoin’s inclusion in national reserves. However, the financial landscape is changing rapidly. If major institutions such as the IMF and global central banks adopt new policies regarding crypto reserves or stablecoins, South Korea may eventually reconsider its stance. For now, Bitcoin remains off the table, but the debate is far from over. With increasing pressure from both domestic stakeholders and international trends, the coming months may see renewed discussions on how South Korea can position itself in the evolving digital financial ecosystem. Bitcoin vs. Quantum Computing: Jameson Lopp Warns Against Quantum Recovery of Lost BTC In other BTC news, the debate surrounding the impact of quantum computing on Bitcoin security has intensified, with Jameson Lopp, Chief Security Officer at Casa, taking a firm stance against allowing quantum computers to recover lost BTC. Instead, Lopp believes that burning these lost coins is the best way to maintain Bitcoin’s fundamental properties, including censorship resistance, transaction immutability, and protocol conservatism. His March 16 article has reignited discussions on whether quantum computing poses an existential threat to Bitcoin’s cryptographic foundation or if concerns about its impact are overblown. Bitcoin’s protocol is designed to be decentralized, immutable, and resistant to censorship. Once a transaction is confirmed and added to the blockchain, it is final and irreversible. This immutability is one of the main reasons Bitcoin has been hailed as ”hard money”, immune to manipulation by governments or financial institutions. However, quantum computing introduces the theoretical possibility of breaking Bitcoin’s cryptographic encryption and allowing powerful actors to recover lost coins. Lopp argues that this scenario would introduce a dangerous form of wealth redistribution, favoring those with access to quantum technology at the expense of those who lost their Bitcoin due to forgotten passwords or misplaced private keys. Lopp warns that such a scenario could undermine trust in the system, as people would no longer be certain that their holdings were immune to future technological advancements. This, in turn, could harm Bitcoin’s security, stability, and decentralization. The potential threat of quantum computers breaking modern cryptography has been debated for years. While some experts believe that practical quantum decryption is still decades away, others argue that quantum advancements could arrive much sooner than anticipated. In October 2024, researchers from Shanghai University claimed that they had developed a quantum algorithm capable of breaking encryption used in military and banking applications. This sparked widespread fears about quantum computing’s impact on Bitcoin and modern cybersecurity. However, critics—including popular YouTuber Mental Outlaw—pushed back against these claims, asserting that the research had been misinterpreted and that the actual breakthroughs were far more limited. According to Mental Outlaw: The quantum computer used in the study only managed to factorize the integer 2,269,753, which is a record for quantum computing but still falls short of classical computers’ capabilities. The device only managed to break a 22-bit encryption key, while classical computers have already broken encryption keys up to 892 bits. Modern encryption uses key sizes ranging from 2048 to 4096 bits, meaning quantum computers still have a long way to go before posing a real threat. These rebuttals suggest that while quantum computing is progressing, it is nowhere near capable of breaking Bitcoin’s encryption or modern security standards. While Lopp argues that quantum recovery should not be an option, others within the crypto space have been working on quantum-resistant solutions to protect Bitcoin from potential threats in the future. 1. Post-Quantum Cryptography Cryptographers and Bitcoin developers have been exploring post-quantum cryptographic algorithms to upgrade Bitcoin’s security before quantum computers become powerful enough to break existing encryption. Some proposals include lattice-based cryptography and other quantum-resistant signature schemes that could be integrated into Bitcoin through a future soft fork or upgrade. 2. Increasing Key Sizes Modern encryption key sizes can increase over time, making them more difficult for quantum computers to break. While 2048-bit and 4096-bit keys are currently used, there are proposals to move toward 8192-bit or even larger keys as a preemptive measure. 3. Multi-Signature (Multisig) & Second-Layer Security Bitcoin users can adopt multi-signature wallets and second-layer security solutions to make their assets more resilient against future threats. Some hardware wallets are also experimenting with quantum-resistant security measures. 4. Transitioning to a Quantum-Secure Blockchain If quantum computers ever pose a serious threat to Bitcoin’s cryptography, the network could undergo a hard fork or migration to a more secure blockchain that incorporates quantum-resistant encryption techniques. The Debate: To Burn or Not to Burn? Lopp’s argument about burning lost BTC instead of recovering it with quantum computers highlights a broader philosophical debate within the Bitcoin community. On one side, purists believe that Bitcoin should remain immutable, and any recovery method—even through advanced technology—would violate its core principles. They argue that burning lost coins is the best way to protect Bitcoin’s long-term stability. On the other hand, some believe that if quantum technology becomes a reality, Bitcoin may need to adapt rather than resist change. Allowing for controlled, regulated recovery of lost BTC could prevent early adopters from losing their holdings while still preserving the integrity of the network.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|ASIA|FIAT|FORKS|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-17 14:00:00

At the same time, on-chain data shows that these smart money pros are buying the dip in some cryptocurrencies. This article looks at some of the top altcoins to buy as smart money sells tokens like Solayer, AAVE, and Pi Network. Smart Money is Selling Solayer, AAVE, and Pi Network Third-party data shows that smart money investors have sold some tokens in the last 24 hours. These investors sold Solayer tokens worth over $7.3 million, Pi tokens worth $2.05 million, and AAVE coins worth $1.2 million. They are selling Solayer because of profit-taking after soaring by almost 90% from its lowest point last week. AAVE and Pi Network selling is likely happening as these smart money investors anticipate more downtrend in the near term. Top 3 Altcoins to Buy as Smart Money Investors Buy the Dip Some of the top altcoins to buy as smart money investors accumulate are Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL), Arbitrum (ARB), and Pepe (PEPE). Smart money is buying these tokens Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) Smart money investors are buying the dip in the VIRTUAL price after it crashed by over 85% from its highest level this year. They accumulated tokens worth almost $950k in the last 24 hours. The most likely reason for the purchase is that these smart money investors anticipate that it will do well during NVIDIA’s GTC event in California. Jensen Huang, the CEO, will be the keynote speaker and will likely unveil new AI solutions. Therefore, these investors likely expect that the VIRTUAL price will bounce back because NVIDIA is the biggest player in AI. For one, it may do well if it is mentioned in the keynote since it is the biggest AI generator in crypto. VIRTUAL’s MACD has also formed a bullish divergence pattern on the daily chart. VIRTUAL Price Arbitrum (ARB) Arbitrum is one of the top altcoins to buy as smart money investors accumulate. They bought ARB tokens worth $571k in the last 24 hours. One reason for their accumulation is that, like VIRTUAL, it has formed a bullish divergence pattern. The two lines of the MACD indicator have continued rising as the token falls. Similarly, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has risen from the oversold level of 25 to 43. A bullish divergence is a popular bullish sign.

This decision follows a clear consensus from the Aave DAO, which opposed the idea of launching a separate token for Horizon. Instead, the DAO reaffirmed its commitment to maintaining $AAVE as the ecosystem’s primary governance and utility asset. Overall consensus across the Aave DAO is that there is no interest on other tokens. The consensus will be respected, Aave DAO is a real DAO. RWA exploration will continue once a right approach is found. There is only $AAVE . pic.twitter.com/tQSb51gmvw — Stani.eth (@StaniKulechov) March 16, 2025 The announcement came via Kulechov’s March 16 post on X, which mentioned that the Aave DAO operates as a truly decentralized organization and that its governance decisions will be honored. The rejection of a new token aligns with concerns raised by the community and developers, who argued that an additional token could dilute the value of $AAVE and create unnecessary complexities in the ecosystem. Horizon’s Institutional Ambitions and the Role of RWAs Horizon was officially introduced on March 13 as Aave’s strategic initiative to bridge institutional finance with DeFi. Aave Labs announces Project Horizon, a new initiative focused on building institutional DeFi products. Learn more: https://t.co/IPruxFuvrH — Aave (@aave) March 13, 2025 The project’s primary offering revolves around allowing institutions to use tokenized money market funds (MMFs) as collateral to access stablecoin liquidity. The aim is to position Aave as the leading liquidity provider for RWAs while preserving DeFi’s transparency and efficiency. At its core, Horizon seeks to address the growing institutional demand for on-chain financial products. The rise of tokenized RWAs has been a major trend in the blockchain space, and the value of on-chain tokenized assets has grown significantly. According to RWA.xyz , the market has expanded by 19% in the last month alone, reaching $18.63 billion, while tokenized U.S. Treasuries have surged 400% year-over-year to $4.26 billion. Source: rwa.xyz High-profile institutional players, including BlackRock, have also embraced RWAs, with its tokenized U.S. Treasury fund, BUIDL , surpassing $1 billion in assets under management. A critical aspect of Horizon’s strategy involves integrating Aave’s native GHO stablecoin as a key liquidity source for institutional borrowing. By leveraging smart contracts to ensure transparency and over-collateralization, GHO aims to provide a decentralized and stable asset that institutions can confidently use. However, with the DAO’s decision against introducing a new token, Aave Labs must now reassess how Horizon will generate liquidity and revenue within the ecosystem. Aave’s Governance and the Future of Tokenomics The rejection of a new Horizon token aligns with Aave’s broader governance strategy, which has recently undergone significant updates through the Aavenomics proposal . The proposal, introduced on March 4, seeks to refine Aave’s tokenomics by focusing on staking rewards, revenue redistribution, secondary liquidity management, and the deprecation of LEND, an older token in Aave’s ecosystem. Aave governance @lemiscate has proposed updates to its tokenomics, introducing Anti-GHO tokens, restructuring staking rewards, and deprecating LEND. #aave #dao #defi https://t.co/wOx9ubWTFu — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 4, 2025 A key element of the Aavenomics update is the introduction of an Aave Finance Committee (AFC), a governance-backed entity responsible for managing treasury funds and overseeing liquidity targets. Another notable thing in the proposal within the Aavenomics update is the introduction of Anti-GHO, a non-transferable ERC20 token designed to replace the existing GHO discount model. This token would be distributed to AAVE and StkBPT stakers and could be either burned to offset GHO debt or converted into StkGHO. Additionally, a buyback and distribution program has been proposed to further reinforce $AAVE’s value. The initial plan suggests allocating $1 million weekly for six months to repurchase AAVE from secondary markets, with potential adjustments based on treasury reports and budget considerations. Looking forward, while the Horizon initiative remains an ambitious effort to integrate RWAs into DeFi, rejecting a new token means Aave Labs will need to explore alternative pathways to fund its expansion. However, it is clear that Aave is making an effort to lead the RWA narrative. As momentum progresses, the company will join the competition of those pushing to establish RWAs successfully.

Foreign investors have begun to take advantage of favorable currency conversion rates and the refuge offered by the market’s low correlation with the rest of the world. Led by US dollar investors, they are buying a lot of negotiable certificates of deposit ( NCDs ). NCDs are short-term debt instruments issued between banks to meet their funding needs. The guaranteed return on these is higher than the return on US Treasuries. Cary Yeung, head of greater China debt at Pictet Asset Management, said, “Global investors are trying to seek something that is very decorrelated… The price action is completely different to the rest of the world. That mindset attracts some of the flow back to China.” This is bad news for the US, as China’s economy is thriving more. However, the US economy has become more unstable under Trump’s policies. China has rather obtained a strength no investor saw coming: Its weak currency. The country has managed to make Chinese goods less expensive and more appealing compared to goods from other countries. While this is happening, the US is trying to reduce its dependence on China through tariffs. So far, it has not worked as expected, but Trump and his administration say it will yield fruits in the near future. The trade war between China and the US favors China After buying Chinese government bonds all year, foreign buyers haven’t added to their holdings since September 2024. Why? The yuan has been weakening, and the carry trade has become less appealing. But since December, they have bought more NCDs, which shows a small change in the flow of capital into China and gives the yuan a safety net as the trade war between China and the US heats up. At the end of February, foreign investors owned 1.14 trillion yuan ($157.51 billion) worth of NCDs. This was the most ever recorded and the third month in a row that investors bought. One-year NCD yields have gone up about 40 basis points (bps) this year to about 2%. Ten-year government yields have gone up 20 bps to 1.89%. In addition, dollar buyers also make 2.8% when they exchange their cash for yuan. This means that NCD investments earn 4.8%, while one-year Treasuries only earn about 4%. The Chinese stocks remain steady An index of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong mostly kept its gain and finished the day up 0.6%. The top-tier mainland CSI 300 Index ended the day 0.2% lower than it started before the conference. On Friday, both gauges went up more than 2% because investors thought the government would support them even more. At the meeting, an official said that China’s central bank is considering new structural monetary policy tools to help key areas of consumption obtain more low-cost money. Li Chunlin, deputy chief of the National Development and Reform Commission, said that consumer demand and trust are still low. According to Shen Meng, a director at the Beijing-based investment bank Chanson & Co., officials are talking about spending more but not enough about how to raise incomes. This could make steps meant to increase consumption less effective. Another bunch of economic data that came out didn’t get much attention from investors, even though it showed some signs of hope. Retail sales and manufacturing output both went up more than economists thought they would. However, this year, Chinese stocks have done better than those in other countries. In fact, In 2025, the MSCI China Index has gone up about 20%, while the S&P 500 Index has gone down about 4%. One reason for this is a rise in technology stocks that the DeepSeek AI model caused.

After cryptocurrencies nearly lost a trillion, the central bank’s move is essential for the investors as its decision could impact not only digital assets but other financial markets. Let’s discuss. How Will the Federal Interest Rate Decision Impact the Crypto Market? At present, the biggest contributor to the crypto market, Bitcoin, trades at $83,2K, with the rest of the altcoins exhibiting the same consolidatory performance. As a result, the global digital assets market cap is just $2.72T, and the trading volume is $69.74B. Also, the investor sentiments are still in a fear zone amid economic uncertainty. In addition, the FOMC meeting and the Federal Reserve interest rate decision could decide the performance of the cryptocurrencies. If the Fed implements a rate cut (lower interest rate), the market could witness high liquidity. More importantly, this could influence investors to take the risks. As a result, this is the bullish scenario for the cryptocurrencies, where Bitcoin and altcoin could seek high returns, especially if the Fed ends QT. The market’s performance would be unexpected if the Fed decided to keep the interest rate study. The volatility may or may not increase, but the investors’ disappointed sentiments could impact the market momentarily. Lastly, the rate hike scenario, which is unexpected, could bring downward pressures as crypto traders move toward safer assets rather than digital assets. All these possibilities will bring different results. Experts believe the Fed will keep the interest rates unchanged , increasing the chances of bullish outcomes. However, various other factors also need to align as many other macroeconomic events could impact the cryptocurrencies. Other Macroeconomic Events to Impact the Crypto Market Beyond the Federal Reserve interest rate decision, several other macroeconomic factors could influence this week’s cryptocurrency market. The key factors include U.S. jobless claims, U.S. retail sales, February Housing Starts data, geopolitical developments, etc. Additionally, the upcoming Trump and Putin meeting to discuss the Ukraine peace policy could also have a significant impact. Other worldwide events like Japan’s and England’s Interest rate decisions could also have a significant impact. Investors must stay updated with the market and remain cautious this week. Bottom Line Bitcoin is following a highly bullish pattern at present. The same pattern led to a massive rally for gold in the 1970s. Over the years, BTC price can surge to $250k due to this bullish pattern, and the Federal Reserve interest rate cuts could play an important role in that. However, the different scenarios could impact the crypto market differently. More importantly, macroeconomic factors like U.S. jobless claims could influence the market. Investors must be prepared for volatility ahead.

To read full editions, subscribe . At Empire, we recently covered momentum investing strategies in crypto. Speaking of momentum…Empire’s Jason Yanowitz spoke to Carson Cook and James Roth of Membrane Labs for this week’s podcast. The three delved deep into what went wrong with crypto lending last cycle (shocker: a lot), and gave their thoughts on lending this cycle. Putting aside the bad from the last cycle, Yanowitz asked if we might see something akin to the numbers that companies like Genesis were putting out (for example: half a billion in loan originations way back in the fourth quarter of 2021). Roth seemed to think so…as long as the markets behave. “ I do think that, over time, you’ll have more and more money coming in, more and more safety being provided to folks around how they lend… and more providers stepping in like custodians, et cetera,” he said. But what really made me perk up — and perhaps this is because I just wrote about it — was Cook’s response, which is that it’s a momentum-driven game in crypto and not a fundamentals game…yet. ”As soon as markets go in one direction, the demand for leverage and lending exacerbates those moves. So they’re sort of the flywheel connects…As James was saying, if it gets going on the price movement side, you’re going to see a lot…I think you could blow through those numbers,” Cook said. The biggest way to grow the lending and credit parts of the market is through custodians, Cook continued. That’s how you unlock “massive potential” and encourage folks to move out of qualified custody or their cold wallets into the market. We’re still early here, and the medium to longer-term issue is not necessarily the markets (though they’ll always have an impact). It goes back to a very familiar subject: regulatory clarity. Man, I can’t wait ‘til I don’t have to write those two little words again. But for now, we still have a long haul ahead. Get the news in your inbox.

Although Shiba Inu's rising burn rate keeps making headlines, investors are seeking more attractive prospects for significant expansion. Remittix's creative approach to cross-border financing is generating waves meanwhile. Now some experts think $RTX will see an amazing increase soon. Read on to get more information. How Does Shiba Inu Burn Rate Increase Impact SHIB’s Price? Over brief times, Shiba Inu's (SHIB) burn rate has seen notable swings with spikes of 3,200% and 5,440%. These burns seek to lower SHIB's circulating supply, therefore potentially improving its value by means of greater scarcity. Notwithstanding these large burns, SHIB's price has not seen a commensurate rise, suggesting that other market variables such as general investor mood and more general trends in the bitcoin market have greater bearing on its price swings. Thus, even if the higher burn rate helps to reduce supplies, its immediate effect on SHIB's price is still unknown and probably limited without concurrent favorable market dynamics.

41814562,https://crypto.news/?p=14345988,1742225587,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/41814562.jpeg,Robinhood & Kalshi debut sports prediction market for college basketball,https://crypto.news/robinhood-kalshi-debut-sports-prediction-market-for-college-basketball/,"Robinhood and Kalshi have launched a prediction market for the men’s and women’s college basketball tournaments, allowing users to trade event contracts on game outcomes. Robinhood looks to be dipping its toes further into the prediction markets, teaming up with Kalshi to let users trade on college basketball matchups. Instead of just filling out a bracket, fans can now buy and sell event contracts, with prices fluctuating in cents based on how the market views each team’s chances. In a blog announcement on Monday, March 17, Robinhood says at launch the so-called prediction market hub “will allow customers to trade contracts for what the upper bound of the target fed funds rate will be in May, as well as the upcoming men’s and women’s College Basketball Tournaments.” Starting today, you can now trade contracts on the men's and women's college basketball tournaments. See you at tip-off: https://t.co/WXpUDpYBJO pic.twitter.com/fRF6xhr0Xd — Robinhood (@RobinhoodApp) March 17, 2025 “Now you can trade on the outcome of every match-up in the men’s and women’s college basketball tournaments, including the final championships,” the Menlo Park-headquartered company said on a dedicated web page. Users who hold winning contracts at settlement will receive a $1 payout per contract, while losing contracts will be worth nothing. How Robinhood’s prediction market works Robinhood says there are no hidden tricks: if a contract is priced at 53 cents, that means the market sees a roughly 53% chance of that outcome happening. Users can also sell their positions before the event ends, allowing them to take profits or cut losses based on price movements. Each event contract follows a simple yes-or-no format, similar to other prediction markets like Polymarket. “Each contract that you own will pay out $1 if that contract resolves to the side you own. It will pay out $0 if not,” Robinhood explains in a FAQ section. You might also like: Episode 1. Are decentralized prediction markets the future of alpha? Users can take either the “Yes” or “No” side on a given contract but cannot hold both sides simultaneously for the same event. However, they can take multiple positions across different matchups. The platform also displays open interest — the number of active contracts held by users — to provide insight into market activity. Robinhood is charging a $0.01 commission per contract per side, and the brokerage executing the orders may impose additional fees, the company added. The brokerage giant says its event contracts fall under Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulations and are offered in partnership with its rival Kalshi, another prediction market platform that allows users to bet on elections, news events, and pop culture. Hidden pitfalls Robinhood’s plans for expanding its prediction market offering remain uncertain, as the space has had its fair share of controversy, with disputes over market resolutions being a recurring issue. Polymarket, one of the largest prediction markets by trading volume, has several times faced criticism over its resolution process. One of such cases involved a market titled “Will Israel invade Lebanon in September?” On the night of Sept. 30, Israel launched military operations in Lebanon to push Hezbollah forces back from the border. While major news outlets widely referred to the action as an “invasion,” suggesting the market should resolve to yes, it ultimately settled as no, sparking backlash from traders. A Polymarket market resolution regarding the outcome of whether Israel invaded Lebanon in September | Source: Polymarket The decision hinged on Polymarket’s strict interpretation of its rules. Although Israeli troops entered Lebanon, some participants argued that an “invasion” required an official declaration or an effort to seize and hold territory — criteria Israel had not explicitly met. Despite the widespread use of the term “invasion” in media coverage, the market was ruled not to have technically fulfilled the conditions for a yes outcome. Robinhood’s move into event contracts adds to a broader trend of financial platforms offering new types of trading beyond traditional stocks and crypto. Moreover, it’s also not the brokerage’s first attempt at prediction markets, as before the November elections, Robinhood briefly introduced its own service and later announced a market for the Super Bowl outcome. However, in February, Robinhood withdrew the offering after the CFTC instructed the company to “not permit customers to access” sports event contracts. At the time, Robinhood expressed disappointment, stating that it had been in “regular communication with the CFTC about our intent and plans to offer this product” prior to the launch.

BIPs are the formal method for discussion of proposed changes to Bitcoin. Theoretically, if a BIP gains sufficient widespread support, it will be added to Bitcoin, by way of a soft fork or a routine update to Bitcoin Core. Often, these BIPs are referred to by nicknames and multiple proposals may be included in a soft fork. BIP 119 refers to OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY (CTV) while BIP 348 refers to OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK (CSFS). This article first appeared on Blockspace Media , the leading Bitcoin industry publication dedicated to covering Bitcoin tech, markets, mining, and ordinals. Get Blockspace articles directly in your inbox by clicking here . Bitcoin’s technical community typically debates these BIPs exhaustively. The Taproot Wizards–a Bitcoin development firm most well known for its Bitcoin NFTs–put out a helpful graphic explaining the confusing and seemingly circular process of these discussions. In short, the Bitcoin soft fork process requires a rough estimate of support from Bitcoin’s stakeholders, including developers, custodians, investors and miners. The best proxy for this stakeholder support remains Bitcoin miners, who can flag support for an alteration to the codebase by signaling for changes in their mined blocks. Typically, Bitcoin Core asks for 95% of blocks over a period to signal for the change before locking in the update for activation. Still, there’s no definitive heuristic for defining what “widespread support” looks like, and Bitcoin consensus is a constantly evolving, moving target. Miners are useful for signalling a change only because they are a truly ‘countable’ entity on the Bitcoin network. In other words, it’s difficult to get a say of meat world consensus given Bitcoin’s decentralized structure. Over the course of February and March, we’ve registered a definite shift as numerous developers gave their explicit support for the two BIPs. What’s in a proposal? Over the course of the last few weeks, numerous Western Bitcoin developers tweeted their support for CTV and CSFS – a strong signal that at least the Twitterverse is coming together in favor of certain changes to Bitcoin. CTV and CSFS allow new ways of writing Bitcoin script. Bitcoin script is Bitcoin’s lower-level programming language used for, among other things, creating and sending transactions. Proposed by former Bitcoin core contributor Jeremy Rubin, CTV has been around for more than half a decade, whereas CSFS was only formalized in November 2024 by Jeremy Rubin and Brandon Black . These two BIPs would enable “covenants” on Bitcoin. A covenant simply restricts the way a wallet can spend bitcoin in future transactions. Covenants are generally expected to significantly improve the landscape for Bitcoin self-custody, fee management, and enhance existing Bitcoin tech like Lightning, Ark, and contract-based applications. Additionally, developers consider these two proposals to be “narrowly defined.” In layman's terms, this means, if they are activated, there is a low probability of users exploiting them for something unexpected. The Bitcoin developer community tends to cautiously deliberate any changes to Bitcoin. For example, even though BIP 119 has remained unchanged for nearly half a decade, there was once a time not long ago when CTV was considered far too aggressive for activation. A long time coming You may remember that Rubin’s previous campaign for CTV received strong pushback – notably from Bitcoiners with large followings, including Adam Back and Jimmy Song . The criticisms evolved into significant pushback from many in the bitcoin community, finally leading to Rubin taking a step back from Bitcoin all together. So what changed? Recent advocacy for the OP_CAT opcode ( BIP 347 ) seems to have widened the Overton Window of acceptable Bitcoin proposals, framing CTV & CSFS as the comparatively “conservative” options. It’s important to note that most OP_CAT supporters are also in favor of BIPs 119 and 348 (and most proposals in general). What can we expect next? For one, more conversation. Developers are expected to gather at a few technical conferences such as OPNEXT in April, BTC++ in July and TABConf in October. Once developers begin to form rough consensus, then the actual activation of the soft fork moves to the miners, community and investors. However, there isn’t a formalized process for “how to soft fork Bitcoin.” So we’re left with a lot of open questions. For example, will a potential soft fork include just CTV and CSFS? Will OP_CAT – which is often included in this opcode suite – join the conversation? How will an actual soft fork activation happen? And will other stakeholders like Bitcoin miners take note? Only one thing is clear: you’re going to have to get comfortable with lots of abbreviations.",Tech,EN,0,0,BTC|FORKS|BUSINESS|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-17 15:37:25

DOGE is still far behind its all-time high from 2021, but if the upward momentum continues, DOGE might be on its way to hitting $1 sooner than expected. The struggling Dogecoin price brought much investor attention to the DTX presale. The presale has seen unprecedented demand as it represents a utility token backed by an incredible real-world use case. The DTX Exchange hybrid trading platform will offer its users an unmatched array of fiat and crypto trading assets and intends to reshape the trading experience. DOGE: Is the OG Meme Coin Making a Comeback? DOGE has a current market cap of over $25B, and analysts are indecisive about whether the Dogecoin price can overcome its current struggles to reach the elusive $1 milestone. The charts show a pattern of lower highs and lower lows, and DOGE has failed to find support above $0.18. This most recent attempt to build momentum will find resistance around $0.27, and if it can counter it successfully, the Dogecoin price might move towards its maximum potential of $0.49. DOGE does not have a supply limit. Its inflationary design means that continuous supply expansion creates persistent selling pressure that any Dogecoin price appreciation must overcome. For DOGE to touch $1, the market must absorb 147 billion DOGE tokens at higher prices and accommodate 4-5 billion DOGE tokens annually. Key crypto experts have given a measured outlook for the Dogecoin price prediction for 2025. As per their technical analysis, the minimum price will be $0.156, and the average trading price by the end of the year will be $0.825. Long-term projections are much favorable, and the Dogecoin price will be trading around $1 a few years from now. Top Crypto Analysts Project 4,000% Surge for DTX Exchange The DTX Exchange presale has received funding of over $16M. The viral presale has been extended to accommodate the demand for the DTX token, promising investors massive returns. Early investors have already reaped sizable profits, and even if one were to buy the token at $0.18 today, you would stand to double your investment once the token lists at $0.36 on Binance or Coinbase soon. Holders of the DTX token will enjoy multiple benefits. Large DTX holders can earn passive income through staking rewards and the Rebate Program, which offers profit sharing. Every DTX token holder, regardless of the size of their investment, will be able to participate in decentralized governance and have voting powers. To remain true to its decentralized nature, DTX prioritizes security and transparency. Solid Proof has audited it to ensure the integrity of its blockchain and for protection against vulnerabilities. DTX has a non-custodial framework and a no-KYC policy to ensure user anonymity and for a tamper-proof trading infrastructure. Key Takeaways At this presale stage, investors have a limited window to buy the DTX token at the current affordable rate. Once the token is listed and traded in the mainstream, it is expected to skyrocket. Even the lowest estimate is that by the end of the year, a 1700% ROR is expected. DTX Exchange is going to be the most revolutionary DeFi project this year.

This decline has largely mirrored the performance of other altcoins. Still, technicals and fundamentals show that buying just 10,000 ADA coins could be life-changing. Buying and Holding 10K Cardano Coins Could be Life Changing Cardano price was trading at $0.7162 on Monday, meaning that purchasing 10,000 coins would cost about $7,155. According to analysts, buying and holding the coin promises substantial returns over time. In an X post , Ali Martinez, a popular crypto analyst, predicted that the coin would soon surge to $10 if it rises and maintains the support at $0.80. A move to that level would be a 488% return from the current level. The 10,000 Cardano coins will be worth $100,000 if that happens. Cardano Price Forecast Other analysts are upbeat about the ADA price. A recent CoinGape article cited one analyst who predicted that Cardano will rise to $20 . Such a move would give you a balance of $200,000. $200,000 is a life-changing amount to many people as it can help them do necessary things like pay a downpayment for a house, pay school fees, and other things. Potential Catalyst for ADA Price Cardano has several bullish catalysts. PolyMarket odds for a spot ADA ETF have jumped, a sign that many analysts expect it to be approved. Such a move would lead to more inflow from Wall Street investors. Cardano has been named as one of the top coins to be in Donald Trump’s Strategic crypto stockpile . Further, Cardano is widely seen as the most decentralizd blockchain in crypto. It recently became the first one to have a ratified constitution. Cardano is the most Decentralized blockchain Cardano Price Chart Points to More Gains Buying and holding 10,000 Cardano could also be profitable once the ongoing consolidation phase ends. The weekly chart shows that the ADA has pulled back after hitting a high of $1.3253 in 2024. It has now moved to the second wave of Elliot Wave pattern. This phase is usually a corrective one, and is usually followed by the third bullish one. The third phase is the longest one. Therefore, the value of Cardano may keep rising as bulls target the 61.8% retracement point at $2. Ultimately, it will likely rise and retest the all-time high of $3, followed by more gains. Cardano Price Chart The bullish ADA price forecast will become invalid if it drops below the key support at $0.5145. That move will invalidate the Elliot Wave pattern and point to more downside to $0.20.

Investors seek tokens that can deliver mind-blowing returns, staking rewards, and a passionate community. With meme coins evolving beyond internet jokes, they’re becoming serious contenders in digital assets. One name that keeps turning heads? Arctic Pablo Coin (APC). It’s more than a meme—it’s an adventure, a journey through icy landscapes where myths and riches collide. But it’s not alone. Other contenders like Moo Deng and Dogwifhat are bringing their own flavors of fun and finance, each with unique ecosystems and explosive growth potential. Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC): The Meme Coin That Unlocks Hidden Riches Deep in the frozen expanse of the Arctic, where ancient myths whisper secrets of untold wealth, a daring explorer named Arctic Pablo Coin rides his snowmobile through the blizzards, uncovering mystical $APC coins buried beneath the ice. Each presale location reveals more of the legend, allowing investors to ride alongside Pablo on his journey to financial glory. Arctic Pablo Coin stands out in a crowded meme coin market. Unlike typical presales divided into stages, Arctic Pablo Coin is a living narrative, moving from one mythical location to another. Currently stationed at Frosty Falls (14th location), the token price is still at a ridiculously low $0.000074—but it won’t stay there for long. The ROI potential is insane. With a launch price of $0.008, early backers can see gains of 10,694.59%. A simple $100 investment now could turn into $10,810.43 at launch. Weekly token burns ensure scarcity fuels value. Any unsold tokens are burned forever, and post-presale burns guarantee continued price appreciation. Staking rewards make the deal even sweeter. With an annual percentage yield of 66%, investors can lock in their tokens, sit back, and watch their holdings grow. All staked coins will be vested for two months from launch to ensure stability and fair distribution. Arctic Pablo Coin runs on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), offering seamless transactions. Investors can buy in using BNB, ETH, USDT, BTC, SOLANA, XRP, and more. Over $1.88 million has already been raised, and supply is rapidly depleting. Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a movement. Investors aren’t just buying a token; they’re joining an expedition to discover untapped riches. Those who hesitate might be left in the cold. It is one of the best crypto presale for 2025 . Moo Deng ($MDG): The Meme Coin With a Stampede of Utility While Arctic Pablo Coin is charting a mythical adventure, Moo Deng is bringing the bull market vibes in full force. A community-driven meme token inspired by the unshakable determination of the Thai water buffalo, Moo Deng aims to charge through market volatility and deliver stable, long-term value. Moo Deng introduces an inflation-proof staking model with a 50% APY, allowing investors to earn passive income while holding their tokens. Deflationary tokenomics ensure value growth by automatically burning tokens, reducing supply over time. Unlike many meme coins, Moo Deng integrates real-world use cases, including partnerships in the agricultural and DeFi sectors. With a strong community and a rapidly growing ecosystem, Moo Deng is more than just a meme—it’s a movement. Investors looking for long-term gains with a side of meme magic should keep an eye on this charging bull. Dogwifhat ($WIF): The Meme Sensation Taking Over 2025 Dogwifhat (WIF) exploded onto the scene in late 2024 and shows no signs of slowing down in 2025. If you missed Dogecoin’s early days or the SHIB hype, Dogwifhat is the next big thing in meme culture and crypto. Dogwifhat runs on Solana (Sonic), delivering lightning-fast transactions at near-zero fees. Its meme magic combined with a strong community presence has made it a cultural phenomenon, with millions of memes circulating on X and Reddit. The token has been rapidly adopted and listed on major exchanges like Binance, Bybit, and OKX, pushing its market cap higher. While early investors saw explosive gains, the meme coin cycle is far from over. Dogwifhat continues to gain traction, and meme coins historically perform well during bull runs. 2025 could be the year Dogwifhat crosses into mainstream adoption. Conclusion: The Best Cryptos to Buy for 2025 Based on our research and market trends, Arctic Pablo Coin is the best crypto presale for 2025. While Moo Deng and Dogwifhat bring their own strengths, Arctic Pablo Coin offers a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity—a fusion of storytelling, scarcity, staking rewards, and explosive ROI potential.

Market analysts are refraining from making a prediction until the broader market’s tariff fears are resolved. If the US Government follows up on its crypto reserve proposal, Ripple will make massive gains. Ripple has performed better than its peers this week, and the XRP price has regained the losses it made last week. As a token with a solid use case, XRP is resilient in the face of market volatility and has excellent potential to help investors accrue passive income. Similarly, DTX Exchange is a hybrid trading platform that powers its token and will allow investors to gain generational wealth. Top Crypto Experts Expect the XRP Price to Touch $5 The XRP price gained 35% on the announcement of federal crypto reserves and then dropped 20% the next day. The chance that a Crypto Strategic Reserve could institutionalize XRP has provided the token momentum to stabilize near $2.4. With growing regulatory clarity for Ripple and expanding partnerships with financial institutions, the XRP price could soon touch $5. 80% of Japanese banks have adopted the Ripple ledger for cross-border transactions, and such partnerships are pivotal in keeping the XRP price growing as the token's utility and demand see a boost. Moreover, upcoming network upgrades will enhance Ripple’s scalability and speed, and it could soon see real-time settlement systems. Although the weekend brought significant volatility for the XRP price, it has stabilized, and the broader picture for Ripple remains positive. A move towards $3 is expected, and the XRP price might see a high of $3.4 this year. DTX Exchange: Revolutionizing the Multi-Trillion Dollar Trading Market In the current financial world, TradFi and Defi exist in silos, making it a difficult market to navigate for traders. They have to use multiple platforms to manage their crypto and fiat assets, most centralized exchanges have a high security risk, and many decentralized exchanges do not support traditional asset classes. The DTX use case will transform the capital trading markets by targeting these pain points to create an efficient and seamless trading experience. DTX Exchange will integrate 120,000 financial instruments, including stocks, bonds, forex, gold, commodities, ETFs, NFTs, cryptocurrencies, and tokenized real-world assets. With its wide array of assets, DTX Exchange will eliminate the fragmentation that has long troubled traders. The hybrid model will have deep liquidity, low fees, and institutional-grade security, making it the one-stop solution for traders seeking ease, speed, and security. With a single unified ecosystem, DTX sets the stage for long-term growth after mainstream adoption sets in. With more integrated financial solutions, DTX has already seen 700,000 users, which will grow exponentially once the platform officially launches and global traders experience its multifaceted capabilities firsthand. Key Takeaways Like Ripple, which has the potential to generate wealth for its investors, DTX Exchange also offers users chances for passive income. As an investor, you stand to double your investment if you buy the token now. If you were wise enough to buy it in the early stages of the presale, you have already made a considerable profit. DTX also offers token holders staking rewards and profit sharing through its Rebate Program. DTX Exchange is an excellent DeFi initiative that explores blockchain's potential and extends its application. It is genuinely a future-ready platform, and its strong fundamentals and roadmap will power the DTX token to unimaginable heights.

Let's Start With Solana,https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/03/17/the-u-s-deserves-better-crypto-etfs-let-s-start-with-solana,"It is now the regulatory open season for digital assets in the United States — and not just because the incoming president released a Solana memecoin on the eve of his inauguration. Now, it and other memecoins are being proposed as assets for a new slew of cryptocurrency ETFs. In just over a month, the U.S. crypto market went from facing an absurd amount of obstruction to an absurd amount of, well, absurdity. While I can scarcely imagine a financial advisor telling me, “You’re slightly under-allocated in $TRUMP coin,” the reality is that these new currencies could be valid assets for an ETF. Another view is that they are completely useless. A more generous view is that they are a form of creative expression. They’re not a symphony by Mozart, sure, but these coins — $BONK, $PENGU — clearly have some cultural value. I can see why some investors, retail and otherwise, would be interested in an ETF of this kind. This brings us to Solana, which is now essentially the 3rd largest asset in terms of market cap and by far the largest in terms of network usage. Bitcoin, while initially envisioned as a kind of digital cash, has emerged as a digital store of value. And Solana has taken the mantle of a blockchain smart contract with its unique Proof of History having the potential to power all kinds of blockchain based applications. It’s time for a Solana ETF. Read more: ‘It’s So Early’: How Solana Is Competing With Ethereum for Institutional Interest The groundwork is there. It took 10 long years and a lawsuit for the Bitcoin ETF to be approved. After more challenges, an Ethereum ETF was also approved — with an asterisk. Every issuer that included providing “staking” rewards in their applications had to strike it. By doing so, the SEC effectively said that the issuers (and the investors) couldn’t participate in the governance of these blockchains, but could invest in them. As a result, every investor who has bought into an Ethereum ETF since last May has missed the opportunity to earn yield on their asset — yield that comes directly from supporting the security of the blockchain itself. If, instead of ETF shares, these investors bought the same amount of Ethereum and staked it (for example, with Coinbase), they could earn, say, 2-4% APY , in return for letting their ETH be used to keep the blockchain secure. Whatever your politics, and however you feel about cryptocurrencies, the truth is that this puts American investors at a disadvantage. European investors already have ETPs for other currencies, and they also have access to staking rewards through them, too. And yet, in the U.S., we are still waiting for a Solana ETF of any kind. And it certainly will not include staking to begin with, as the issuers learned from the Ethereum case not to include it. In my view, Europe’s approval of the staking ETPs should set the precedent for a staking ETF in the United States. As for why that staking ETF should be for Solana, well — the fact that the president’s memecoin was released on Solana is no accident. It is a popular blockchain that can handle billions in transaction volume, even when it is unexpected. Its scalability and power will inevitably be applied to real-world assets in tradfi, and any other number of real-world use cases. Not giving investors access to invest in this technology through their traditional financial accounts is like if we limited investors to invest in Amazon or Google during their initial offerings. This is why a Solana ETF should be quickly approved: to give the broad retail and institutional investors access to the next biggest asset after Bitcoin and Ethereum. In short: Solana is overdue for an ETF of its own, and I urge the new leadership at the SEC to approve the applications they have inherited from those including Grayscale, VanEck, 21Shares, Canary Capital, and Bitwise - and even encourage them reintegrate staking rewards into their proposals. (Canary’s application has reached a second stage of SEC review , indicating it could be approved in due course.) It is still early, so we are yet to see the long term impacts of this administration’s approach to cryptocurrency. But it’s possible that it could push through a new, better framework for crypto-asset products. That would be worth the hype.",Opinion,EN,0,0,SOL|BUSINESS|ETH|BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-17 15:54:50

It's built atop Razer ID, Razer's existing login service, and will help guarantee there's ""a real person behind every Razer ID account,” according to a statement shared by Razer and World. The collaboration between the two firms comes as artificial intelligence (AI) tools are seeping into every corner of online life — including inside of video games, which have been plagued by non-human AI ""bots"" since long before the rise of Altman's ChatGPT. According to a study from Echelon Insights that World shared with CoinDesk, roughly 59% of gamers said that they regularly encountered unauthorized, third-party bots in their games. In addition to posing a general nuisance to players, bot accounts often have tactical advantages over real players, which can ruin the competitiveness of some multiplayer games. “Game developers now have a tool to build dynamic spaces where real players —not bots— dominate the digital landscape,” World said in its statement. Razer's integration with World Network builds upon World's existing blockchain-based identity solution, which uses iris scans to differentiate real humans from robots online. The new feature will be integrated first into “TOKYO BEAST,” a blockchain-based game set in a version of Tokyo based 100 years in the future. It's an apt pairing: the game's main premise involves humans coexisting with autonomous androids. When users log into TOKYO BEAST, they will be prompted to sign in using a World-authenticated Razer ID, ensuring they can play online with real human players only. “As AI continues to reshape the gaming world, we want to empower gamers and game developers with the tools they need to navigate this transformation safely and confidently,” said Wei-Pin Choo, the chief corporate officer at Razer. “By teaming up with World, we’re ensuring that real players are the heart of every experience, keeping gaming fair, immersive, and designed for humans.” Read more: Sam Altman's World Network Unveils New Chat Feature to Connect Real Humans",Tech|worldcoin|Gaming|AI,EN,0,0,WLD|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-17 16:00:00

ADA has tumbled 40% over the week to sit at $0.70, its lowest price since late 2023, while DOGE is at risk of slipping under $0.156 after falling 18.52% in seven days. Technical charts scrape together no bullish case for either: ADA is on the cusp of a death cross that could have it staggering lower for months, while DOGE can’t hold the $0.16 support price. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging from this chaos, achieving $3.6million in presale and 5,800 holders looking for exponential returns. Is this a decentralized lending platform that could provide safe haven from the storm? The Position of Dogecoin Dogecoin’s recent decline beneath $0.16 dashed hopes of a quick recovery. Other analysts point out that an upsloping channel has recently propped up rallies, though a breach warns of steeper drops ahead. With macroeconomic headwinds rising, the prospect of DOGE rising to $2.00 after a push above $0.16 seems more dubious. Proposed Dogecoin ETFs, such as the filing by Bitwise Asset Management with NYSE Arca, may infuse optimism, but approval is far from guaranteed. Meme coins may now face a more wibbly-wobbly path to $0.60–$0.80 profit targets, as traders acknowledge that continued U.S. trade tensions and Fed rate policy shifts can increase meme coin instability. DOGE’s path, without a clear catalyst, seems laden with volatility. Cardano’s 5 percent drop on Thursday highlights its fragility. ADA’s “death cross” formation — a technical feature where short-term averages fall beneath long-term ones — suggests further losses, with the coin trading beneath all major moving averages. Resistance is looming at $0.7050, with analysts cautioning that a slide under $0.65 could lead to a downward spiral towards $0.50. While bullish U.S. inflation data soothed wider markets, ADA’s lag behind peers like BNB and XRP underscores its specific risks. Concerns about rising tariffs in ongoing trade wars have sapped investor confidence, driving many toward assets with clear utility. Mutuum Finance Gains Traction Now in phase three of its presale at $0.02 per token, the project has raised $3.6 million as investors flock to secure positions ahead of the price rising to $0.025 in phase four — a 25% jump for current buyers. Early participants will enjoy 200% returns at launch, with MUTM set to list at $0.06. Longer-term projections are bolder: an analyst predicts a move to $3.50 in post-launch trading based on its innovative lending model and tokenomics that rewards holding. In contrast to speculative assets such as DOGE or ADA, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) focuses on real-world utility. Its decentralized lending protocol enables users to borrow against overcollateralized assets, reducing the risk of default while generating passive income via mtTokens—which are interest-accruing deposit certificates. This RPG tokenomics model helps build a strong community based on shared values and aligns interests as a built-in buy pressure mechanism will allocate platform revenue to repurchase MUTM tokens, redistributing to stakers and mitigating sell-offs. This design makes demand grow in tandem with adoption, creating a space to amplify. Confidence in Demand is Proven in Presales The swift movement through the presale phases has been indicative of market confidence. Phase three is filling up quickly, with 5,800 holders already on board as investors see the window closing for entry. But buying now locks in a 25% gain in under a month before phase four and where launch itself offers holders the potential for a 200% gain. Even conservative estimates predict a return of 17,400% after listing when MUTM hits $3.50 — a figure many consider possible due to its hybrid lending model combined with its rapidly growing number of partnerships. With ADA and DOGE floundering, the emergence of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents a shift towards projects that combine innovation with realistic use cases. And where meme coins rely on hype-ridden cycles, its presale success is grounded in transparent tokenomics and a security-audited platform. As macroeconomic headwinds buffet the crypto market, MUTM’s focus on sustainable growth via DeFi utility is a compelling alternative. The question is not simply whether experts are correct about ADA and DOGE’s slump in 2025 — it’s where savvy investors will look to next. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) responds with a presale that is 300% to the third-phase cap, and a roadmap set for explosive adoption. There’s little time left to act before phase three ends.

This development has sparked speculation about its potential impact on the XRP price. This article explores how high Ripple price could go if the company launched a crypto wallet amid growing institutional interest and ongoing legal clarity. XRP Price Poised to Rally As Ripple Trademarks Downloadable Software XRP price today trades at $1.32, reflecting a modest 1.4% increase. This uptick follows Ripple’s trademark filing for downloadable software, signaling the company’s intent to launch a cryptocurrency wallet and broaden its crypto offerings. Ripple Trademark Filing Pro-XRP lawyer Jeremy Hogan has opined that this product will likely be launched in the next six months. Once the trademark office approves the filing, the crypto company will only have six months to advertise and offer the product. “Be on the lookout for the Allowance of Use from the trademark office… Ripple only has 6 months to advertise, sell, etc, the service, and file a Statement of Use (SOU). You’ll know what it’s all about before the end of the summer probably,” Hogan stated. Once this product launches, it will bolster Ripple’s presence in the crypto industry. The blockchain company has already taken the lead in the blockchain-powered payments sector, with this offering set to boost an XRP price rally to as high as $5 within months., How High Will Ripple Rally? XRP price is poised for a parabolic rally once this product is launched. This filing comes amid several bullish catalysts that are already driving Ripple’s price including the possible end of the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit , a spot ETF filing, and a possible $125M XRP purchase by the US government. Ripple has a bullish outlook on its daily chart. The price has broken out of a descending trendline on the daily chart and is dropping to retest this level. A successful retest will confirm the strength of the trend. If it holds this support and forms a bullish leg past the 50% Fibonacci level of $2.57, it could stir massive gains to a multi-month high of $3.75. Bollinger bands confirm this bullish outlook after XRP price turned the middle band into support. Looking at the past trends, each time Ripple moved above this middle band ignited an uptrend. With the potential launch of a crypto wallet, this rally could happen soon. However, for this bullish trajectory to continue, the RSI needs to flip above 50 to confirm a surge in the buying pressure. XRP/USDT: 1-day Chart The potential release of a crypto wallet that will expand Ripple’s digital asset offerings and the bullish technical outlook suggest that the price could be on the path towards a massive rally towards $5.

From 10 Thousand Dollars to 4 Thousand Dollars! British banking giant Standard Chartered has lowered its 2025 year-end price target for Ethereum from $10,000 to $4,000. Saying that ETH’s structural decline is likely to continue, the bank lowered its target, citing various factors including the increasing dominance of Ethereum Layer-2 Base. Geoffrey Kendrick, head of global digital assets research at Standard Chartered, said that Coinbase’s layer 2 network Base has reduced the market value of ETH by $50 billion, and that this trend is expected to continue. “While Ethereum continues to dominate in key areas, its market position is weakening. Layer-2s and especially Base are now making super profits from the Ethereum ecosystem. But if market forces, particularly tokenized real-world assets, grow significantly, this structural decline could stop.” Kendrick also said that another way to stop the decline in ETH is through the Ethereum Foundation. “Another solution would be for the Ethereum Foundation to tax the excessive profits of Tier-2s, just as governments sometimes impose excessive taxes on foreign mining companies that make excessive profits. Unless that happens, ETH-BTC will continue to fall,” the analyst said. Kendrick also said that he expects the ETH/BTC ratio to drop to 0.015 by 2027, its lowest level since 2017. The analyst finally added that although ETH is expected to recover along with Bitcoin (BTC), its underperformance is likely to continue. *This is not investment advice.

Ron Kirk says Trump tariff policies are “perceived defenses than a strategy”,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/former-us-trade-rep-ron-kirk-on-trump-tariff/,"Former US Trade Representative Ron Kirk believes the Trump administration’s tariff policies are based on “animus and middle-of-the-night perceived offenses ” rather than strategy. Kirk, who served under President Barack Obama, argued that tariffs set to take effect on April 2 are basically an emotional response. “ Our markets are fairly unequivocal on this and don’t see this as a long-term benefit to our economy ,” Kirk said in CNBC’s Squawk Box earlier today. “ This is just not the correct way to go. Canada and Mexico are vital to our economy, with billions of dollars flowing across our borders daily. Imposing duties on those goods will only raise costs for American farmers, manufacturers, and ultimately, consumers. “ Trade partners ‘fight back’ as tariffs take effect Last week, the Trump administration imposed 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from multiple countries, including Canada and Mexico, along with a 20% levy on Chinese goods. US allies have now responded with retaliatory tariffs. The European Union is placing duties on $28 billion worth of American exports, including a 50% tax on American bourbon. set to take effect on April 1 and be fully implemented by April 13. They also apply to other American products like motorbikes, boats, steel and aluminum goods such as pipes, window frames, and tin foil. According to President Trump, tariffs will strengthen US manufacturing, safeguard jobs, and generate tax revenue, ultimately fueling domestic economic growth. The president has also coined the levies as a tool to correct America’s trade imbalance and could narrow the gap between imports and exports with trading partners. The trade conflict escalated last Thursday when Ontario threatened to impose tariffs on electricity exports to the US. In response, Trump announced he would double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum by 50%. Ontario was forced to withdraw its tariff threat, which gave Trump an incentive to back down, but the Canadian government’s patience with the US is getting thinner by the day. During his interview, Attorney Kirk discussed the statements made by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who recently met with French President Emmanuel Macron. Carney said the importance of Canada strengthening ties with reliable allies and described Canada as “the most European of non-European countries.” “ That’s fighting words ,” Kirk reckoned. “ But for businesses, this is no joke. I’ve spoken with business groups who are struggling to operate in an unpredictable environment. They have no idea what their costs will be. This kind of uncertainty is bad for markets and devastating for businesses .” The former US Trade rep said Carney’s words meant that US allies no longer want to depend on the US, adding that it’s “not a good place for the country to be.” Trump doubles down on tariffs with economic risks in mind The Trump administration is unshakably committed to its protectionist trade policies. The president has vowed to implement sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs on all imports, including universal duties on goods from Canada and Mexico. His cabinet is very supportive of the policies, coining Trump’s decisions as “necessary to revive the American manufacturing industry.” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick admitted to reporters last week that a recession could result from the tariffs but suggested it would be “worth it” in the long run. Still, Kirk pushed back on the administration’s rationale, saying. “ To many Americans, the idea of hitting back with tariffs sounds appealing, but the broad imposition of tariffs against our closest allies is an economic circular firing squad—no one benefits from this .” Kirk argued that if America wanted to compete with China , it should bring its allies like Canada, Mexico, and Europe closer rather than isolate them. “ America First’ may sound good, but ‘America Alone’ is a dangerous path, ” the lawyer concluded.

The Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF aims to capture the overall trends in the crypto market by providing diversified exposure to a range of digital assets. By adding Litecoin ( LTC ), Hashdex will expand the ETF’s asset base, potentially improving its diversification and making it more attractive to investors interested in the cryptocurrency sector. An exchange-traded fund is an investment fund that holds a collection of assets, such as stocks, bonds, or cryptocurrencies. ETFs trade on stock exchanges, allowing investors to buy and sell shares throughout the trading day, similar to individual stocks. This structure provides diversification as investors gain exposure to multiple assets within a single investment. Hashdex recently received approval from Brazil’s Securities and Exchange Commission to launch the world’s first XRP ( XRP ) spot ETF on the B3 stock exchange. The decision came as multiple U.S. issuers, including Grayscale and WisdomTree, awaited SEC approval for similar products. Litecoin, created in 2011, is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency that enables instant, near-zero-cost payments to anyone worldwide. It operates on an open-source, decentralized payment network without any central authority.

According to DePIN analyst Arty Fischle, despite all the talk about them transforming the onchain landscape, Nno one knows what AI agents actually do.” The comments were made during a panel discussion at a recent DePIN conference where guests were treated to complimentary wine and spirits as they discussed AI advancements. “If you ask me,” said Fischle, draining his third glass, “agents are this cycle’s metaverse. No one uses them, no one wants them, and no one understands them.” His comments provoked a backlash from fellow panelists, with one urging Fischle to “Shush for all our sakes” before launching into a detailed explanation of the role agents play in verifying other agents to ensure a verifiable agentic framework. Agent Arty Earns a Recall Fischle’s comments, which quickly began circulating on social media, were dismissed by a host of agent launchpads, agent frameworks, and GPU compute networks for AI agents. According to one Senior Partner contacted by Cryptopolitan, whose Venture Capital firm has invested heavily in agentic startups, “AI agents can significantly enhance blockchain ecosystems by automating tasks, optimizing smart contract operations, and enabling intelligent, data-driven decision-making.” They added: “As AI-driven automation improves, AI agents will power next-generation web3 ecosystems, bridging the gap between human decision-making and decentralized machine intelligence.” When pressed for examples of what agents would actually do, the Senior Partner muttered something about “low battery” and then the line went dead. Crypto Twitter Weighs In On crypto Twitter, opinion concerning Arty Fischle’s controversial comments was divided. Some users expressed solidarity with the outspoken panelist, claiming to have only been feigning interest in agents all along.

41815937,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=140718,1742227828,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Massive Bitcoin Mining Merger: Bitfarms Seizes Stronghold in $110M Deal,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitfarms-stronghold-mining-merger/,"The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with news of a significant consolidation in the Bitcoin mining sector. Bitfarms, a prominent player in the industry, has officially finalized its acquisition of Stronghold Digital Mining in a substantial $110 million all-stock transaction. This massive merger isn’t just another deal; it’s being hailed as the largest ever between publicly traded Bitcoin mining firms, as reported by Crypto in America. Let’s dive into what this means for the future of Bitcoin mining and the broader crypto landscape. What’s the Buzz About This Bitcoin Mining Acquisition? In simple terms, Bitfarms is expanding its empire. By acquiring Stronghold Digital Mining, they are significantly boosting their operational capacity and, crucially, their foothold in the U.S. energy market. This isn’t just about getting bigger; it’s about strategic growth. Think of it like this: Scale Matters: In Bitcoin mining, efficiency and scale are paramount. A larger operation can often achieve better economies of scale, leading to increased profitability. Energy Dominance: Access to stable and cost-effective energy is the lifeblood of Bitcoin mining. This acquisition dramatically increases Bitfarms’ share of the PJM grid, a major U.S. power grid, jumping from a modest 6% to a commanding 80% by the end of the year. This secures their energy supply and potentially reduces costs. Market Leadership: This merger positions Bitfarms as an even more dominant player in the competitive Bitcoin mining arena, potentially influencing market trends and setting new industry benchmarks. This move comes hot on the heels of Riot Platforms’ unsuccessful attempt to take over Bitfarms. While Riot ended up with a 20% stake, Bitfarms has charted its own course, choosing strategic acquisition over being acquired. With the deal now complete, Stronghold Digital Mining has officially ceased trading on NASDAQ under the ticker SDIG, marking the end of an era for the company as an independent entity. Why is a Crypto Mergers like This Significant? Mergers and acquisitions in the crypto space, especially within Bitcoin mining, signal a maturing industry. Here’s why such crypto mergers are noteworthy: Aspect Significance Industry Consolidation As the Bitcoin mining industry matures, we’re likely to see more consolidation. Smaller players might find it challenging to compete with larger, more efficient operations, leading to mergers and acquisitions. This can lead to a more stable and professionalized industry. Increased Efficiency Mergers can lead to operational efficiencies by combining resources, technologies, and expertise. This can result in lower mining costs and higher profitability for the merged entity. Market Power Larger entities wield greater market power. In Bitcoin mining, this could translate to more influence on network hash rate distribution and potentially even pricing negotiations with energy providers. Investment Attraction Consolidation can make the Bitcoin mining sector more attractive to institutional investors. Larger, more established companies are often seen as less risky and more appealing for significant investments. Bitfarms’ Strategic Play: Beyond Just Size This isn’t simply about Bitfarms becoming bigger; it’s about strategic positioning and long-term vision. The Bitfarms acquisition of Stronghold Digital Mining brings several key advantages: Expanded Energy Portfolio: Gaining control of 80% of the PJM grid share is a game-changer. It provides Bitfarms with greater energy security and potentially better energy rates, which are crucial for profitability in Bitcoin mining. Diversification of Assets: Acquiring Stronghold’s infrastructure and assets diversifies Bitfarms’ portfolio, reducing reliance on single locations or energy sources. Synergies and Efficiencies: Combining the operational expertise of both companies can lead to significant synergies and efficiencies in mining operations, technology deployment, and management. Strengthened Market Position: This move solidifies Bitfarms’ position as a leading publicly traded Bitcoin mining company, enhancing its credibility and appeal to investors. Stronghold Digital Mining: What Does This Mean for Them? For Stronghold Digital Mining, being acquired by Stronghold Digital Mining marks a significant shift. While the SDIG ticker is no more, their assets and operations are now integrated into the larger Bitfarms ecosystem. Here’s a possible perspective: Part of a Larger Vision: Stronghold’s assets and expertise become part of a larger, more robust entity with greater resources and market reach. Shareholder Value: Stronghold shareholders received Bitfarms stock in the acquisition. The value of their investment is now tied to the performance of the combined entity, potentially offering greater long-term growth prospects. Operational Integration: Stronghold’s mining facilities and personnel will be integrated into Bitfarms’ operations, contributing to the overall efficiency and scale of the merged company. End of Independent Journey: The acquisition signifies the end of Stronghold’s journey as an independent publicly traded company. However, their contribution will continue as part of Bitfarms. Navigating the Complexities of Mining Acquisition While acquisitions like this present numerous benefits, they also come with challenges. Successfully integrating two large companies, especially in a dynamic and technologically intensive sector like Bitcoin mining, requires careful planning and execution. Some potential challenges include: Integration Hurdles: Merging operations, technologies, and teams from two separate companies can be complex and time-consuming. Ensuring a smooth integration is crucial to realizing the anticipated synergies. Cultural Differences: Companies often have distinct organizational cultures. Successfully merging these cultures and fostering a unified working environment is essential for long-term success. Market Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is inherently volatile. External market fluctuations can impact the profitability and overall success of the merged entity. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency and Bitcoin mining is constantly evolving. Navigating these regulations and ensuring compliance across the expanded operations is an ongoing challenge. Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts and Investors What can we learn from this mining acquisition and what are the actionable takeaways? Consolidation is a Trend: Expect to see more mergers and acquisitions in the Bitcoin mining space as the industry matures. Keep an eye on companies that are strategically positioned for growth through acquisition. Energy is King: Energy access and cost-effectiveness are critical factors in Bitcoin mining success. Companies with strong energy portfolios and strategies are likely to be more resilient and profitable. Due Diligence is Key: For investors, understanding the strategic rationale behind mergers and acquisitions is crucial. Analyze the potential synergies, challenges, and long-term prospects of the combined entity. Adaptability is Essential: The crypto landscape is constantly evolving. Companies and investors need to be adaptable and prepared to navigate changes in technology, regulations, and market dynamics. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Bitcoin Mining? The Bitfarms acquisition of Stronghold Digital Mining is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a transformative event that signals a new phase of maturity and consolidation in the Bitcoin mining industry. This merger creates a formidable Bitcoin mining powerhouse, poised to capitalize on the growing demand for digital assets and potentially shape the future of the sector. As the industry continues to evolve, strategic moves like this will likely become more common, redefining the landscape and paving the way for a more concentrated and potentially more efficient Bitcoin mining ecosystem.

Pectra will go live on Hoodi on March 26, and if all goes well, the long-awaited upgrade will proceed to Etheruem's mainnet roughly 30 days later, according to the network's core developers. Hoodi was created following faulty Pectra tests on Ethereum’s other testnets, Holesky and Sepolia, which failed to finalize properly due to problems with how they were configured. Test networks like Holesky, Sepolia, and Hoodi aim to mimic the main Ethereum network — allowing developers the opportunity to test out code changes or major upgrades like Pectra in a low-stakes environment before deploying them to the mainnet. Originally, the Pectra upgrade would have been activated on Ethereum following those two earlier tests. Because they didn't go smoothly, developers decided to build Hoodi to test the ambitious Pectra upgrade one more time, although the testnet can also be used for future tests. Hoodi is designed to mimic Ethereum’s mainnet, with the same number of validators on its network. Ethereum core developer Parithosh Jayanthi argued during last week’s Ethereum core developers call that Hoodi would therefore be the testnet for Ethereum staking pools and node operators to test their infrastructure. Holesky and Sepolia were built for different purposes: Holesky has a bigger validator set than Ethereum’s mainnet, which is supposed to help test out scalability problems, while Sepolia is a closed network just for developers, meant for testing out applications. Pectra contains a series of upgrades designed to make Ethereum more user-friendly and efficient for developers and end-users. One of the biggest changes includes adding ""smart contract"" capabilities that could give wallets new features, like the ability to pay gas fees in cryptocurrencies other than ether (ETH).

Now, in 2025, the world’s largest digital currency has reached $83,223 on this holiday, marking a staggering 1,558,000% increase in just 13 years. With institutional adoption surging and supply remaining fixed, Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory appears stronger than ever. A Look at Bitcoin’s Explosive Growth Bitcoin’s price movements in the early years was anything but predictable. In just one year, from 2012 to 2013, BTC skyrocketed 780%, reaching $47. The next year, it surged again to $630, a 1,240% increase from 2013. However, Bitcoin’s price swings have been sharp. By 2015, it had retraced to $290, but by 2017, it climbed to $1,180, and in just one more year, it hit $8,321—a 605% increase. Even after a pullback to $4,047 in 2019, the next five years saw Bitcoin go from $5,002 in 2020 to $83,223 in 2025. 2012 $5.34 2013: $47 2014: $630 2015: $290 2016: $417 2017: $1,180 2018: $8,321 2019: $4,047 2020: $5,002 2021: $56,825 2022: $41,140 2023: $26,876 2024: $68,845 2025: $83,223 Why Bitcoin’s Price Keeps Rising Despite its volatility, Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory remains upward, driven by increasing demand and fixed supply. Unlike fiat currencies, which governments can print indefinitely, Bitcoin’s supply is capped at 21 million coins. As more individuals, institutions, and even governments adopt Bitcoin, scarcity drives prices higher. Several major factors are contributing to Bitcoin’s growing adoption in the last year: The U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve – United States Senator Cynthia Lummis and Congressman Nick Begich both introduced legislation to green light the U.S. to purchase 1,000,000 BTC for their strategic reserves, further solidifying its legitimacy and causing other countries potential FOMO in. Corporate Adoption – Companies like Strategy, Metaplanet, and Rumble continue adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets, treating it as a strategic reserve asset. Spot Bitcoin ETFs – The approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs in the U.S. has opened the floodgates for institutional investment, allowing hedge funds, pension funds, and retail investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin through regulated financial products.These ETFs have collectively purchased over 1 million BTC. Halving – On April 19th, 2024, Bitcoin underwent its fourth halving event, where the block reward for those mining Bitcoin was cut in half from 6.25 BTC per block to 3.125 BTC per block. This decrease in the amount of daily new bitcoin issued on the market historically leads to an increase in the price of BTC. Bitcoin halvings occur roughly every 210,000 blocks (approximately every four years). What’s Next? With demand skyrocketing and supply shrinking due to upcoming Bitcoin halvings, Bitcoin seems poised to continue its historic rise in price. If history is any indicator, the best time to buy Bitcoin was years ago—the second-best time might be today.

Cronos ( CRO ), formerly known as Crypto.com Coin, climbed to a high of $0.090, up more than 26% from its lowest level this month. The closely-watched vote to create the Cronos Strategic Reserves passed by a wide margin. This means the network will create 70 billion new CRO tokens, effectively reversing the burn event that took place in 2021. The new tokens will be unlocked monthly over the next 10 years, which could lead to dilution. However, developers noted creating these reserves will help boost the ecosystem and attract over 1 billion users over time. One of the key initiatives includes creating exchange-traded funds backed by the CRO token. You might also like: XRP is rising, but a crash to $1 is possible unless it flips this price The challenge for most CRO holders is that creating 70 billion new tokens will increase supply, which could weigh on the price. Cronos price rose after the developers proposed burning 50 million coins from the 70 million CRO in the community pool. This will be the fourth token burn in recent months. At current prices, these tokens are valued at approximately $4 million. The vote, which is expected to pass easily, will run through March 17. Cronos price analysis CRO price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that CRO’s price has moved sideways over the past few days. It remains below the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages. Cronos has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern whose two lines are nearing convergence — a sign that a significant move may be on the horizon. The Relative Strength Index and the Moving Average Convergence and Divergence, or MACD, have formed a bullish divergence pattern. This happens when oscillators are in an uptrend while the asset is in a downtrend. Cronos has also formed a triple-bottom pattern at $0.0710. It has failed to move below this price three times since 2024. Therefore, the coin may soon bounce back if it holds above the support at $0.0710. If this happens, the next target will be the 100-day moving average at $0.1080, about 30% above the current level. A drop below the triple-bottom pattern at $0.0710 would invalidate the bullish outlook.
