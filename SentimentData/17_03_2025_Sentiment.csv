41773764,https://coinpaprika.com/news/libra-creator-hayden-davis-linked-to-wolf-token-amid-new-controversy,1742160476,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/41773764.jpeg,LIBRA Creator Hayden Davis Linked to WOLF Token Amid New Controversy,https://coinpaprika.com/news/libra-creator-hayden-davis-linked-to-wolf-token-amid-new-controversy,"Hayden Davis, the controversial creator of the LIBRA meme coin, has been linked to a new token called WOLF , which shares similarities with his past projects. Blockchain analysis from Bubblemaps revealed that 82% of WOLF’s supply was controlled by a small group of wallets, fueling suspicions of insider manipulation. This development comes as Argentine authorities continue investigating Davis for his involvement in the LIBRA scandal. Davis launched WOLF around the time that Jordan Belfort, the real-life ""Wolf of Wall Street,"" was rumored to be introducing a meme coin under the same name. The sudden buzz around WOLF drew attention from traders, particularly the WallStreetBets (WSB) community, sending its market cap surging to $40 million. However, just like previous Davis-related tokens, WOLF’s price plummeted soon after, with analysts suspecting a rug pull. Blockchain data indicated that the token’s supply was funneled through a web of addresses before leading back to a wallet linked to Davis. Blockchain analytics firm Bubblemaps tracked the movement of WOLF’s funds and found that they had been transferred across 17 wallets and five different blockchains before arriving at a single address identified as belonging to Davis. The similarities between WOLF and his past projects, including MELANIA and LIBRA, further reinforced suspicions of a pattern of coordinated token launches followed by price crashes. Davis has a history of controversial meme coin projects. LIBRA, one of his previous tokens, became a political scandal when Argentine President Javier Milei briefly endorsed it. This endorsement sent the token’s value skyrocketing past $4 billion before it collapsed, wiping out nearly all of its value. Blockchain analysts discovered that key insiders, who had acquired large amounts of LIBRA before Milei’s endorsement, quickly sold their holdings for over $100 million, leaving retail investors at a loss. Davis later admitted to playing a role in the LIBRA project and also confessed to launching a meme coin associated with former US First Lady Melania Trump. His involvement in multiple meme coin controversies has drawn legal attention, particularly from Argentine authorities who have launched an official investigation into the LIBRA case. The fallout from LIBRA has also led Argentine lawyer Gregorio Dalbon to call for an Interpol Red Notice against Davis, which could result in his arrest and possible extradition. Critics argue that Davis' continued involvement in the crypto space raises concerns about the lack of oversight in meme coin projects. The rapid creation of tokens, often associated with high-profile names, has become a strategy to generate market hype before an eventual collapse. These tactics have repeatedly left investors holding worthless tokens while a select few profit significantly. The growing scrutiny around Davis’ actions reflects broader concerns about the risks associated with meme coins and the need for regulatory oversight. Many traders remain drawn to the speculative nature of these projects, but the repeated pattern of sudden crashes has raised red flags within the cryptocurrency community. As legal pressure mounts, it remains unclear whether Davis will face consequences for his role in these projects. While some argue that buyers should conduct thorough research before investing in highly speculative tokens, others believe that stricter regulations are needed to prevent high-profile manipulations like the ones Davis has been accused of orchestrating. The case of WOLF serves as another example of the volatility and unpredictability of the meme coin market. While meme coins continue to attract traders looking for quick profits, the risks associated with unverified projects remain high. With authorities increasingly scrutinizing such schemes, the future of unchecked meme coin launches may be in question.",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-16 21:27:56

The streamer says she was held at gunpoint by several individuals demanding that she hand over the private keys to her crypto. According to Fox 26 , the suspects include Dylan Nesho Campbell, Bryan Anthony Salazar Guerrero and two additional suspects between the ages of 16-17. Campbell and Guerrero were each charged with aggravated kidnapping and aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon, as was the 17-year-old suspect. Siragusa reported that several armed individuals entered her home late at night on March 2, beat her, and held her at gunpoint, demanding her cryptocurrency. Source: Amouranth Luckily, her husband was on speakerphone, which the gunmen took in an attempt to access a crypto app. The husband, having been alerted to the situation, grabbed a handgun while attempting to gauge where the armed men were in the home. The online streamer led the assailants around the home and convinced them to start looking for a cold storage device. As the armed robbers were looking for the device, Siragusa ran upstairs to her husband, who was also watching the situation unfold on the home's network of cameras. Once she was safely upstairs, her husband fired off three rounds at assailants, likely shooting one in the process before the home invaders retreated and law enforcement arrived at the scene. Siragusa’s husband later revealed that he was the one posting from her account as the incident unfolded. Source: Amouranth The streamer previously disclosed that she held roughly 211 Bitcoin, worth over $20 million in November 2024, to online followers — making her a target for armed robbery.

However, volatility and uncertainty have dominated the market since the start of the month, keeping LINK’s price action unstable. Related Reading: Cardano Is ‘About To Break Free’ – Breakout Above Crucial Supply To Trigger A Big Move–Analyst The token has seen wild price swings, moving from $17 down to $13, briefly rebounding to $16, and then collapsing to a low of $11.8. Bulls are now fighting to push LINK back above the $15 mark, but momentum remains weak, and the market appears to be consolidating around current levels. Despite this uncertainty, on-chain data is showing promising signs. Metrics from Santiment reveal that 640,000 LINK were pulled off exchanges in the last 24 hours, which is typically a bullish signal. Large withdrawals from exchanges often indicate long-term accumulation, as investors move their holdings into private wallets instead of keeping them available for immediate selling. With exchange outflows rising, traders are watching closely to see if LINK can break through resistance levels and confirm a shift toward bullish momentum. The next few trading sessions will be key in determining whether LINK can recover or if further consolidation is ahead. Uncertainty Looms As Investors Watch For A Breakout Chainlink is currently holding above the $13.5 mark, struggling to reclaim higher levels as selling pressure and market uncertainty persist. Despite its recent recovery attempts, LINK remains stuck below key resistance, making investors cautious about its short-term direction. Analysts and traders are concerned about a potential drop below the current range, as on-chain metrics suggest a distribution phase may be unfolding. If LINK fails to hold its support zone, it could see renewed selling pressure, sending the price toward lower demand levels. However, not all signals are bearish. Crypto expert Ali Martinez shared Santiment data on X, revealing that 640,000 LINK were pulled off exchanges in the last 24 hours. This is often seen as a bullish indicator, as large investors typically withdraw their holdings from exchanges when they anticipate higher prices in the future. When whales and long-term holders accumulate, it reduces selling pressure on the market and strengthens price stability. If LINK manages to break key resistance levels, this accumulation trend could set the stage for a strong recovery rally.

The next few days will be critical as investors watch for a breakout or further downside movement. Chainlink Bulls Defend Key Support Levels Chainlink (LINK) is currently trading at $14, facing resistance at the $15 level as bulls struggle to reclaim higher ground. The market remains under pressure, and LINK must hold current levels to avoid a deeper correction. For a recovery rally to take shape, bulls need to defend the $13 support zone and build momentum toward a breakout above $15. If LINK successfully pushes past this resistance, the next major target is the $17 level, where it must reclaim the 200-day moving average (MA) and the exponential moving average (EMA) to confirm a bullish trend reversal. However, if LINK fails to hold its current support levels, selling pressure could intensify, driving the price toward the $10 range or even lower levels. This would put LINK in a deeper downtrend, making a short-term recovery more difficult.

The Best Meme Coins for Exponential Returns include Arctic Pablo Coin , a thrilling adventure-themed crypto, Official Melania, a politically charged meme token, and Shiba Inu, the legendary Dogecoin rival. Each of these coins brings something unique to the table, whether it’s a high-stakes presale, community-driven growth, or a strong ecosystem. Investors are eyeing these trending meme coins for their potential to deliver massive returns, making them some of the hottest opportunities in the market right now. Arctic Pablo Coin: The Best New Meme Coin for Exponential Returns on an Icy Adventure Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) isn’t just another meme coin presale ; it’s one of the Best New Meme Coins for Exponential Returns, inviting investors on an exhilarating expedition led by the intrepid explorer, Arctic Pablo. This narrative-driven cryptocurrency transforms the investment journey into a thrilling adventure, blending storytelling with financial opportunity. Unlike traditional presales divided into stages, Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale is structured around unique locations, each representing a chapter in Pablo’s quest. Currently, in its 14th location, Frosty Falls, $APC is priced at $0.000074 per token. Early investors have already raised over $1.88 million, anticipating a remarkable 10,694.59% return on investment when the coin lists at $0.008. This innovative approach not only adds excitement but also makes Arctic Pablo Coin one of the Best New Meme Coins for Exponential Returns, as each location unlocks new opportunities for investors. To enhance scarcity and value, Arctic Pablo Coin employs a deflationary mechanism by burning unsold tokens weekly during the presale. This strategy ensures that the total supply decreases over time, potentially increasing the value of remaining tokens. All burn transactions are transparently recorded on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), reinforcing trust within the community. Investors can further benefit from staking their $APC tokens, earning a generous 66% Annual Percentage Yield (APY).

But will the price cross the much anticipated $1 mark this year? This has been the main focus of much of the debate on the price these last few weeks, especially as the price showed a strong bearish hit in the last few months. However, while the price hitting $1 has seen much debate, some analysts have started speculating that Remittix might hit the $1 mark before Shiba Inu. But seeing that the Remittix token is a more recent addition to the market, could the Remittixprice growth cause it to hit $1 before a top option like the Shiba Inu? When is Shiba Inu Price Hitting $1? The Shiba Inu price has been in a negative direction since the start of this year, dropping as low as 52% in the last 90 days. This is even a fair value due to its recent growth in the last 7 days, which saw it end the week at 2.7% growth. Overall, the price outlook of the coin reflected that it has been on a bearish move for the last 4 months. However, using the recent price change, is the Shiba Inu price showing a possible price jump towards $1 soon? There was a strong bearish impact on the Shiba Inu price earlier this year due to the surge in meme coins, which has slowed the growth of the Shiba coin. But, following the slight change in direction in the last few days, the Shiba Inu daily chart shows the coin on an uptrend seen from the breakout above the 7 SMA. However, it is too early to take this growth literally to mean the price is heading toward a new high. The Shiba Inu price chart shows that there are still a couple of levels that could show strong resistance for the coin to break. Some of the notable resistance to break includes the current zone at $0.00001270, the $0.00002021 zone, $0.00003075, and the old ATH at $0.00008846. Breaking these zones could help the Shiba Inu coin cancel out some zeros, but the $1 range could still be far-reaching and might not be possible this year. Remittix Stays Closer to Hitting $1 This Year The Remittix token has been the talk of top analysts for the past few weeks, as the new token continues to wow investors and critics with its growth so far. While the Remittix presale round gets closer every day to its final lap, the price growth has not shown any sign of slowing down. Currently, the funds raised in the Remittix ICO have hit a new high of almost $13.9M, showing the resilience and strong potential of this new token. However, while the Remittix token continues to look like it can only keep going up, what does the future look like after its presale round? The Remittix token, being a big project of the Remittix exchange, has been designed to get strong backing from the exchange. The Remittix exchange, however, is a new crypto solution changing the dynamics of crypto-FIAT payment. This solution helps users convert and send cryptocurrencies from their wallet directly to a bank account cheaply and faster. This new solution in the crypto market and the projected high demand for the exchange service by individuals and businesses are what analysts believe will keep driving the Remittixprice up. Although the presale price of the Remittix token is currently $0.0734, it is projected to see a surge of over 50x after launching, meaning the price will grow 50 times. This could easily take the Remittix price over $1 before the end of this year. This would be a great opportunity to take advantage of the Remittix token price now, which is less than $1.

As several projects struggle with volatility, investors are now taking a hard look at cryptocurrencies quietly reaching milestones. One such project, the Pi Coin, just had its sixth birthday, attracting investors' interest. However, another token , Remittix, remains in the shadows and might have greater potential. Pi Coin Celebrates Big Milestones—What Does It Mean for Investors? Currently priced at around $1.4, Pi Network celebrated its sixth birthday recently , with two milestones: the Mainnet migration completion and the successful launch of Open Network PiFest. These steps reflect the platform's maturity and increasing adoption. Pi Network's recent auctions of the.pi domain are strengthening its ecosystem, bringing in real-world use cases. Price action is still mixed, with Pi Coin trading between $1.20 and $1.90 as the community raises concerns about stringent KYC verification policies. Pi Coin bull investors are hopeful that upcoming exchange listings and additional adoption can boost the token exponentially. Some predictors even estimate prices to rise as high as $200-$500 in 2030 if the market environment is favorable. But dangers do lurk. Falling below the key support of $1.20 would take Pi Coin downwards, and wary investors would shy away from committing themselves fully. Pi has to keep up the momentum in order not to fall into bearishness. Source: Tradingview Remittix Shines as a Hidden Gem at $0.0734 Despite the success of the Pi Coin, Remittix is quietly building itself into a crypto market dark horse. With a current price of $0.0734, Remittix is making headlines with its revolutionary PayFiprotocol. Already having raised close to $13.9 million in its presale phase, Remittix sent over 520 million tokens into wallets, reflecting the rising popularity. Apparently, investors are impressed by the real-world functionality delivered by the project and have expressed huge confidence in its development prospects. Compared to other altcoins, Remittix simplifies payments in cryptocurrency. People can send cryptocurrency and convert it instantly into their currency in the real world, solving one of cryptocurrency's biggest problems: utilizing it in the real world. Consider an Ethiopian coffee exporter who receives payment from Europe and North America. Gains in most instances are lost due to delayed wire transfers and costly conversions leading to loss and lateness. Remittix receives such payments in real-time and remits them directly into cash currency in the local country. This easy solution aside from saving expense also saves efficiency and this is why businesses use Remittix over other payment systems. To this end, Remittix raised close to $13.9 million in its presale process by selling over a half a billion tokens. These figures show immense investor support for the Remittix cause and set it up for immense growth this year. Contrary to the majority of hype tokens, Remittix adoption comes as a result of practical use and thus remains very attractive to investors in times of volatile markets. Remittix Could Be the Crypto Star of 2025 As investors evaluate Pi Coin and similar projects, Remittix’s practical approach to digital payments positions it uniquely. Its growing popularity among merchants and individual users illustrates a genuine market need. Remittix’s PayFi protocol addresses real-world problems, such as delays, high fees, and exchange rate losses. This creates consistent demand even when broader markets fluctuate. Given its strong early performance, Remittix could easily become one of this year’s breakout stars. Investors looking for stability and tangible benefits should seriously consider this promising newcomer in crypto. Ready to explore the token analysts call the hidden gem of 2025? Visit Remittix to discover how its PayFi approach is changing cross-border transactions and why investors are jumping in early.

The rapid growth of Pi Coin got attention in the past but Remittix (RTX) stands as a rising contender that demands increasing attention. The directed strategy combined with practical financial solution development at Remittix positions it to have stronger prospects than Pi Network despite recent challenges. A Tough Stretch for Pi Coin The coin price for Pi Coin experienced downward trends throughout recent weeks.

At the time when these price decreases happened Pi Coin held between $1.43 and $1.59 trading rates before dropping to about 51% under its $2.99 highest mark in history on CoinGecko records. source: coingecko.com The value decline becomes associated with continuous obstacles throughout the Pi Network.

Numerous users of Pi Coin encountered significant difficulties during the mainnet migration because of KYC and technical problems and token transfer issues.

Remittix (RTX) is the one to watch in 2025. Its innovative crypto-to-fiat conversion system is going to completely rethink cross-border transactions as we know them. Read on to learn more about the token. Polygon (POL) Suffers Massive Price Decline As 99% of Polygon's (POL) holders experience price loss, the slide of Polygon toward $0.21 keeps on. Over a 24-hour period, the blockchain lost $13.2 million worth of liquidity, which strengthens forecasts of a continuous downward market trend. Prices have decreased by 34.45% monthly during this time of extreme withdrawal, hence market players are hurrying to identify fresh investment prospects. Polygon's declining price does not exhibit any indication of a transient development. The Artemis data reveals a constant negative flow of money from its chain network, therefore indicating general declining confidence within its network. Most POL token holders now find themselves in a hazardous scenario and run the risk of losing their funds. Open Interest dropped 1.29% in futures markets at the same time trade volume increased by 73% to suggest aggressive short-positioning activity. The technical study shows unfavorabletrends because POL approaches the February key support level. Remittix Is Set To Surge Providing fast and reasonably priced cross-border solutions, Remittix (RTX) is redefining global payments by aggregating FIAT transactions with blockchain technologies. Supported by more than forty cryptocurrencies, the platform provides rapid translations into FIAT currencies like USD and GBP, therefore enabling simple bank account deposits. Remittix is the better alternative to conventional payment providers like Stripe and Wise. As a link between crypto and FIAT, both crypto-exclusive systems like Coinbase Wallet and Remittix guarantee accessibility and inclusivity for companies and people by supporting over 50 crypto pairs and 30+ FIAT currencies, simplifying world trade. Notable also is the platform's open flat-fee approach, which offers savings and transparency over absurd rates of exchange of conventional banks. In the payments industry, Remittix is revolutionary since this approach guarantees that the whole amount transferred reaches the recipient, therefore addressing unethical activity all too often. Why Now Is The Best Time To Buy Remittix At $0.0734 in the presale stage, the RTX coin offers a good investment potential. Forecasts reveal an interesting rise; demand for innovative cross-border payment solutions is generating a 25x multiplier in the presale phase and over 1,500% increases following launch.

Imagine getting into a meme coin early, riding the wave, and cashing out with a life-changing 3650% ROI. The meme market is heating up with the top new meme coins to join in March 2025, and the best part? Some of the biggest gainers of 2025 haven’t even hit the mainstream yet. While everyone scrambles to chase old projects, smart investors are already stacking up presale gems that could explode. BTFD Coin (BTFD) is thriving with a potential moonshot to $0.006, making waves with its Bulls Squad community and high-stakes referral program. Add in the explosive Pudgy Penguins and Peanut the Squirrel, and you’ve got a power trio primed for massive gains. Let’s dive into why these are the top new meme coins to join in March 2025 before the next big pump. 1. BTFD Coin (BTFD) – The 3650% ROI Beast With a Bulls Squad Ready to Charge If you’ve ever missed a life-changing meme coin rally, BTFD is handing you a second chance on a silver platter. This isn’t just another presale—it’s a full-fledged movement built around the legendary Buy The Dip mindset. While the market panics, BTFD holders are buying in, stacking up, and charging straight to the moon with this top new meme coin to join in March 2025. Currently, in its 14th presale stage, BTFD Coin is already making headlines, having raised over $6.32 million with 11,400+ holders locking in their positions. The current price sits at $0.00016, but once the presale ends, BTFD will launch at $0.0006—meaning anyone investing today could triple their money before it even hits exchanges. Now, let’s talk numbers. Suppose you throw in $13,500 at $0.00016 per coin. That bags you 84.375 million BTFD tokens . When BTFD reaches its projected $0.006 moonshot, that stack would be worth a jaw-dropping $506,250! Even if you’re aiming for the short-term, by presale launch at $0.0006, your bag still turns into $50,625—insane gains for an early entry. But BTFD isn’t just about price speculation. The Bulls Squad—featuring Baby Bull, Raging Bull, Nerdy Bull, and Peoples Bull—has created a strong community-driven ecosystem with staking, a 90% APY, and an engaging Play-to-Earn (P2E) game that lets you earn rewards while having fun. The full version of the BTFD game is now live, bringing even more utility and engagement to the project. And if you love making money while doing nothing, BTFD’s Referral Rewards Program lets you earn 10% in BTFD tokens when people use your referral code. If you’re in the top 20 referrers by the end of the month, you’re stacking even more rewards. Why is BTFD shining bright among the top new meme coins to join in March 2025? No meme coin presale right now has this level of community hype, staking rewards, and explosive potential. 2. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) – The NFT King Entering the Meme Coin Space Pudgy Penguins has already cemented itself as an NFT blue-chip, but its entrance into the meme coin world has flipped the script. The project’s expansion from NFTs to crypto tokens is bringing millions of dollars in liquidity, backed by a loyal community of die-hard holders who won’t let it sink. The Pudgy Penguins meme coin is all about interoperability between NFTs and DeFi. Holders can stake, earn, and participate in ecosystem growth while reaping benefits from an already thriving brand. With exclusive NFT integration and limited-edition token airdrops, this is more than just another meme coin—it’s a full-blown Web3 economy. Why does PENGU deserve a spot among the top new meme coins to join in March 2025? Because it’s merging two of crypto’s hottest sectors—NFTs and meme coins—in a way that few have ever pulled off. 3. Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) – The Meme Coin With a Nuts Community If you think meme coins are just a trend, the Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) community is here to prove you wrong. This meme project skyrocketed after its Coinbase listing, and despite market dips, its engagement remains stronger than ever. The secret? A community-first approach with a hilarious, meme-worthy brand that keeps investors engaged. PNUT has built its reputation with interactive community events, staking rewards, and influencer-driven growth. Unlike other meme coins that rely purely on hype, Peanut the Squirrel actually delivers fun utility, and value. From exclusive airdrops to partnerships in the NFT space, PNUT is positioning itself as a long-term player in the meme coin world. Why is PNUT worth watching besides the top new meme coins to join in March 2025? Because while other meme coins fade, this one has a community so strong, that they’d rather hoard PNUT than sell it. Final Thoughts – The Window to Huge Gains is Closing Fast! Meme coins aren’t just for laughs anymore—they’re making life-changing money for early investors. If you’re looking for top new meme coins to join in March 2025, these three are leading the charge. BTFD Coin is already turning heads with its 3650% ROI potential, Pudgy Penguins is breaking boundaries with NFT integration, and Peanut the Squirrel is proving that community-backed projects thrive even in rough markets. But here’s the deal—these opportunities won’t stay at these prices for long. BTFD is already in Stage 14, and once the presale ends, the price jumps to $0.0006. If you want to maximize your gains, now’s the time to get in before the window slams shut. The meme coin boom of 2025 is just getting started, and only those who act fast will be the ones cashing out when the real fireworks begin.

BTFD’s referral program lets users earn 10% in BTFD tokens when someone uses their referral code to invest. If you’re in the top 20 referrers, you get even bigger rewards. The leaderboard resets monthly, so the more you refer, the more you earn! Why is BTFD’s Bulls Squad important for the community? The Bulls Squad is the backbone of BTFD, representing the strongest diamond-hand community in the presale. Baby Bull, Raging Bull, Nerdy Bull, and Peoples Bull, it create a fun, engaging, and community-driven movement rather than just another meme coin. What makes Pudgy Penguins different from other meme coins? Pudgy Penguins isn’t just a meme coin—it’s backed by a blue-chip NFT project with massive brand recognition. It bridges the gap between NFTs and crypto, providing exclusive staking benefits, airdrops, and DeFi integrations. How can Peanut the Squirrel keep its momentum? PNUT thrives on a powerful community, influencer backing, and real utility. With its Coinbase listing, staking rewards, and NFT partnerships, it continues to evolve while keeping investors engaged with regular events and token burns. Is investing in meme coin presales safer than buying after launch? Yes! Presales offer lower entry prices, protect against market volatility, and provide exclusive rewards. BTFD’s presale, for example, lets investors triple their money before listing—a massive advantage over post-launch buyers.

WIF could reach a maximum price of $3.98 by the end of 2028. By 2031, WIF’s price may surge to $6.46. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to the crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins hitting the market afterwards. Dogwifhat has thus far recorded significant feats in terms of valuation and exchange listing. The token approached the $5 mark on March 31, 2024 ($4.58B market cap), saw massive price movements after the November U.S. elections, and got listed on Binance US, Coinbase, KuCoin, Robinhood, and more. However, a massive bear market ensued, and WIF lost momentum. Leaving investors asking: How high can dogwifhat crypto go? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs). Overview Cryptocurrency Dogwifhat Ticker WIF Current price $0.464 Market cap $463,862,590.8 Trading volume $170.73M Circulating supply 998,840,965.85 WIF All-time high $4.85 on March 31, 2024 All-time low $0.000023 on November 2023 24-hour high $0.5022 24-hour low $0.4638 Dogwifhat price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 13.61% 50-day SMA $0.791 14-Day RSI 38.86 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 30 (Fear) Green days 12/30 (30%) 200-Day SMA $1.903 Dogwifhat (WIF) price analysis: WIF sees minor gains, bullish reversal imminent? TL;DR Breakdown WIF shows signs of recovery in the short term but is not yet significant. Dogwifhat (WIF) resistance is present at around $0.528. WIF’s immediate support level is present at $0.429. Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart: WIF faces rejection at $0.528 WIF/USDT is in a downtrend on March 16 after facing rejection at $0.528 on the previous two candlesticks. The MACD is slightly bullish, suggesting potential for a rebound, and the RSI (37.87) shows neutral to oversold condition. If $0.429 holds, a recovery toward $0.528, $0.601 or $0.649 is possible. A breakdown below $0.429 could lead to further declines. WIF faces rejection at $0.528 Dogwifhat price analysis 4-hour chart: WIF to retest $0.492 soon? The 4-hour WIF/USDT shows a clear decline in price, though with some recovery brewing. Dogwifhat currently trades just above the lower Bollinger Band (a short-term support level). A bounce from this level could lead to another attempt at the $0.492 resistance level. WIF to retest $0.492 soon? The MFI reflects a seller-dominated market, while the Balance of Power (BOP) suggests a bullish bias, though not significantly overwhelming the selling pressure. To confirm the position of the BOP indicator, WIF needs to recapture the $0.492 price level and break past resistance at $0.525. Dogwifhat technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.8692 SELL SMA 5 $0.7200 SELL SMA 10 $0.7153 SELL SMA 21 $0.6470 SELL SMA 50 $0.7912 SELL SMA 100 $1.4255 SELL SMA 200 $1.9036 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.6153 SELL EMA 5 $0.7531 SELL EMA 10 $1.0408 SELL EMA 21 $1.4250 SELL EMA 50 $1.9466 SELL EMA 100 $2.21 SELL EMA 200 $2.25 SELL What to expect from WIF price analysis? The broader outlook for WIF is bearish. In the meantime, a recapture and break out of the $0.492 – $0.528 price level is needed to confirm a possible bullish reversal, while a long-term push above $0.649 could signal a sustainable uptrend. A failed bullish attempt could result in further price declines towards $0.395. Is Dogwifhat crypto a good investment? Dogwifhat (WIF) is a meme coin on the Solana blockchain. Its value is driven by community interest and speculation. Projections indicate that by 2025, the price could recover to about $1 to $1.5. While it may have potential for short-term gains, it’s equally risky. Only invest after thorough research. Where to buy WIF? Currently, traders and investors can buy Dogwifhat (WIF) on these CEXs: Binance, Binance.US, Raydium, Coinbase Exchange, Gate.io, KuCoin, Crypto.com Exchange, MEXC, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, LBank and several other s . Why is $WIF down? WIF is down after recently facing rejection at $0.529. The coin is down due to diminishing market interest and folding liquidity triggered by massive selloffs and a shift to other assets that investors consider more profitable. Dogwifhat (WIF) price chart | Coinmarketcap Dogwifhat (WIF) price chart | Coinmarketcap Will WIF reach $10? Having reached a peak price of $4.85 in 2024, the $10 target might not be too far-fetched. Can Dogwifhat reach $100? Dogwifhat (WIF) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and could be unlikely. Its market must be at least $99.9 billion – a value that exceeds the highest market cap ever for a meme (Dogecoin) at $88.79 billion. DOGE’s marketcap history | GlobalData Does WIF have a good long-term future? WIF has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of about $1.2 by the end of 2025 and about $5 to $7 by 2031. However, as with all meme coins, WIF’s future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support.

According to the announcement , the initiative could first be in a three-year experimental regime. The banking institution’s idea is to enable crypto trading for only those Russian investors who have at least 100 million rubles (or $1.1 million) in securities and deposits or whose annual income in the previous year exceeded 50 million rubles (approximately $570,000). The proposal allows entities categorized as qualified investors under current legislation to participate in the experiment. The Bank of Russia also aims to establish certain regulatory requirements for financial organizations willing to adopt cryptocurrency. The introduction of this regime could increase market transparency, offer more opportunities for experienced investors who are open to taking on higher risks, and establish clear standards. In the past, Russia’s central bank has repeatedly warned that cryptocurrencies are not issued or guaranteed by any jurisdiction and are notorious for their enhanced volatility. As such, investors should be aware that entering the ecosystem might result in crucial losses. The banking institution still does not recognize the asset class as a means of payment. That said, it proposed banning transactions between residents involving cryptocurrencies outside the experimental regime and enforcing penalties for violating this rule. On the other hand, multiple reports have emerged since Russia’s ‘special military operation’ against Ukraine that started over three years ago that local firms, as well as the government, are using crypto to bypass Western sanctions.

As Ripple advances its legal battle and files new trademarks, how will XRP markets react in the week ahead? Ripple (XRP) Tumbles 8% to End 4-Day Winning Streak Ripple (XRP) emerged as one of the top-performing assets last week, fueled by renewed optimism in Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). On Thursday, FOX analysts reported that the SEC is considering classifying XRP as a commodity as part of ongoing settlement negotiations to conclude the long-running case against Ripple. The SEC is reportedly using Ethereum’s current regulatory treatment as a benchmark in its deliberations. Ripple (XRP) Price Action | March 16 If this reclassification materialises, it could significantly enhance XRP’s prospects for ETF approval and potential inclusion in a strategic crypto reserve. However, after four consecutive days of green candles for Ripple price , driven by the SEC reclassification speculations, another major regulatory headline appears to have cut the XRP price rally short. Why Is XRP Price Going Down Today? After a four-day winning streak fueled by speculation that the SEC may classify XRP as a commodity, another major SEC announcement appears to have halted the rally. On Friday, March 14, the SEC announced its decision to pause the approval process for altcoin ETFs , triggering a downturn in the prices of top altcoins over the weekend, particularly those with ETF filings in progress. This development partly explains why XRP’s price has now plunged 8%, dropping from its Friday peak of $2.49 to $2.29 as of March 16. Derivatives Market Analysis Flashing Early Rebound Signals Despite the recent price dip, XRP’s derivatives market metrics indicate that bullish sentiment may still be in play. First, the latest Coinglass data shows, XRP’s trading volume has increased by 12.11%, reaching $6.05 billion. This suggests that despite the price pullback, there is still significant market activity. Ripple (XRP) Derivatives Market Analysis | Source: Coinglass Also, the 24-hour liquidation data (Rekt) stands at $11.58 million, with $8.98 million in long positions and $2.60 million in short positions. This suggests that while longs took losses amid the weekend drop, short sellers are now at risk of a squeeze if the price stabilizes. XRP’s open interest has dropped by 6.70% to $3.14 billion, indicating that leveraged positions are unwinding. This could signal the end of the current correction, setting the stage for a fresh uptrend if demand picks up. With strong derivatives volume and long positions outweighing shorts, the market appears to be positioning for a rebound. If broader sentiment improves and regulatory fears subside, XRP could regain momentum in the coming days. 3 Key Events XRP Traders Must Watch in the Week Ahead XRP’s correction phase appears temporary, with derivatives market indicators pointing to sustained bullish momentum. Here are key factors influencing price movements this week: 1. Ripple Files Trademark for New Crypto Wallet Application According to recent media posts , Ripple has reportedly filed for a trademark under the name “RIPPLE CUSTODY,” which hints at a potential new product focused on crypto storage solutions. Ripple Files Trademark for New Cryptocurrency Wallet Application, March 16, 2025 This development could drive fresh investor interest in the week ahead.

U.S. Federal Reserve Decision on February 19 The upcoming Fed meeting will play a crucial role in shaping broader market sentiment.

Strategic investors will keenly watch out for Soundbites, and insights from key ETF sponsors in the coming weeks. XRP Price Forecast: Bulls Eye $2.80 Rebound XRP price forecast suggests a broader crypto market recovery is underway, setting the stage for XRP’s next move. The XRP/USDT daily chart presents a mix of consolidation and volatility, but key technical indicators hint at a potential rebound. The Keltner Channel (KC) midline at $2.35 is acting as immediate resistance, and a breakout above this level could open the door toward the upper KC band near $2.77. XRP Price Forecast The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 47.49 sits in neutral territory, signaling neither overbought nor oversold conditions. However, its recent bounce from 40 suggests growing bullish momentum. A sustained RSI climb above 50 would reinforce the case for continued upside. Despite the recent 8.38% dip in a single session, volume data shows a healthy recovery, with prior bullish days recording over 1.25 billion in volume—a sign that buyers remain engaged. If XRP can maintain support near $2.30, the bulls could regain control, driving prices toward $2.50 in the short term and $2.80 in extension. On the flip side, failure to hold $2.30 could invite deeper retracements, potentially testing the lower KC band near $1.92.

33767162,[object Object],1742169634,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Is The Bitcoin Cycle Peak In? Historical Halving Data Suggests Upside Potential Into Late 2025,https://bitcoinist.com/is-the-bitcoin-cycle-peak-in-historical-halving-data-suggests-upside-potential-into-late-2025/,"Bitcoin is now down over 29% from its all-time high (ATH) in January, and speculation about a coming bear market is growing among investors. After weeks of heavy selling pressure, Bitcoin has entered a consolidation phase, trading between $80K and $85K, with no clear breakout direction yet. Bulls now face a critical test, as they must push BTC above key resistance levels to prevent bears from driving prices lower. If BTC fails to reclaim $85K-$90K, it could lead to another round of selling pressure, sending the price toward lower demand zones. The uncertainty in global markets, combined with macroeconomic headwinds such as inflation concerns, rising interest rates, and trade war fears, has kept investor sentiment fragile. Despite this short-term uncertainty, insights from IntoTheBlock highlight an important historical trend—when analyzing previous Bitcoin halvings, peaks typically occur 12–18 months post-halving, which would point to mid-to-late 2025 as the likely timeframe for this cycle’s top. The big question remains: Is this cycle different? With institutional adoption rising, government policies shifting, and market volatility increasing, analysts are watching closely to determine whether Bitcoin will follow its historical pattern or if external factors will reshape this cycle. The next few months will be crucial in deciding Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory . Historical Halving Trends Suggest More Growth Ahead Bitcoin has been under heavy selling pressure, mirroring the broader struggles of both the crypto market and the US stock market. Macroeconomic uncertainty, trade war fears, and tightening financial conditions have all contributed to weakened investor sentiment, leading to widespread volatility across risk assets. Since the start of the month, Bitcoin has dropped nearly 20%, and the bearish trend appears to be holding. However, despite the short-term weakness, market fundamentals remain strong. Institutional adoption continues to grow, and US President Donald Trump’s plans to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve could serve as a major catalyst for future price movements. Insights from IntoTheBlock on X highlight that when looking at historical Bitcoin halving cycles, peaks tend to occur 12–18 months after a halving event. This pattern suggests that the current cycle’s top could emerge around mid-to-late 2025. While institutional flows and regulatory developments could introduce new variables into this cycle, IntoTheBlock analysts believe there is still time left before Bitcoin reaches its true peak. If historical trends hold, this correction may be a necessary phase before another major rally unfolds. Bitcoin Struggles Below $85K As Bulls Face Critical Resistance Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at $84,200, struggling to regain momentum after days of selling pressure that have kept the price below the $85K mark. Bulls must reclaim the $90K-$91K level to confirm a potential recovery, as this range coincides with the 4-hour 200 moving average (MA) and exponential moving average (EMA)—key technical levels that often signal trend shifts. If BTC can break through this resistance, it could trigger a strong upward move, potentially setting the stage for another push toward all-time highs. However, failure to hold above $85K and reclaim the moving averages could lead to further downside pressure, sending Bitcoin below the $80K mark. With market sentiment still fragile, bulls face a critical test in the coming days. If BTC remains trapped below resistance, selling pressure could intensify, forcing the market into lower demand zones. On the other hand, a decisive breakout above $90K could restore bullish momentum, signaling a potential end to the recent correction phase. The next trading sessions will be crucial in determining Bitcoin’s short-term trajectory.

Trader Ali Martinez tells his 132,900 followers on the social media platform X that whales gobbled up more than $815.514 million worth of ETH in less than a week. “Whales have bought more than 420,000 Ethereum ETH in [five days]!” Source: Ali Martinez/X Martinez is also keeping a close watch on Ethereum’s In/Out of the Money Around Price (IOMAP) metric – which classifies crypto addresses as either profiting, breaking even, or losing money – to determine support and resistance levels for ETH. According to Martinez, ETH is currently trading in a narrow range between stiff support and resistance zones. “Ethereum ETH key levels to watch! On-chain data reveals $1,870 as the strongest support and $2,050 as its toughest resistance!” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, ETH is trading for $1,941. Turning to Bitcoin ( BTC ), the trader believes that the crypto king is poised to witness tactical rallies after breaching the horizontal resistance of an ascending triangle pattern. “Bitcoin BTC is breaking out! The target is $90,000 as long as the $84,000 support holds.” Source: Ali Martinez/X An ascending triangle pattern may be considered a bullish reversal structure if the asset soars above its horizontal resistance. At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $84,288. Turning to Ethereum rival Cardano, the analyst predicts rallies for ADA if the altcoin takes out the diagonal resistance of a triangle pattern at around $0.75. “Cardano ADA is about to break free! Busting out of this triangle will trigger a 15% price move.” Source: Ali Martinez/X A triangle is typically viewed as a consolidation pattern as it signals a potential breakout in either direction. The asset is considered bullish if the price moves above the diagonal resistance and bearish if it tumbles below the diagonal trend line. At time of writing, ADA is worth $0.744.

Participants in Pi Network gained 1000% through early investments since the network had not obtained broad market acceptance at that time. During its early price increase many people overlooked the gemstone and consequently started to doubt whether they would encounter another similar lucrative opportunity. The project Remittixgenerated a presale success rate worth $13.9 million through selling 520 million+ tokens at $0.0734 each. Lessons from Pi Network’s Rapid Rise PI Chart since its inception on February 20, 2025. Source: tradingview Pi Network became known to the public due to its remarkable 1000% growth. The sudden price spike surprised seasoned traders about how quickly altcoins move from small community use to widespread global adoption. Manifesting dramatic value growth serves as evidence for spotting worthwhile cryptocurrency projects when they start at a low level since market performance often leads to unnatural cost elevation. The ability to mine Pi grew popular among crypto users because of its user-friendly mobile platform along with its easy-accessible mining process which allowed more people to participate. The inclusive philosophy of the platform eventually transformed into widespread curiosity which resulted in exceptional price growth. People who did not catch the initial opportunity study alternative coins that demonstrate real market potential for explosive growth. Introducing Remittix: A Real-World Payment Focus The core focus of Remittix lies in delivering instant crypto-to-fiat solutions compared to how Pi depended on community-building and accessibility features. The team seeks to make the process easy for regular people and companies exchanging digital tokens with traditional currencies since it represents a major barrier toward blockchain adoption. The Remittix token features both business utility and simple design elements which help it exceed the role of exchange tokens.The Remittix presale reached recognition when it accepted $13.9 million through the sale of 520 million tokens. Investors recognize the market potential of creating a simple solution between regular currency and cryptocurrency exchanges since new adopters face challenges with difficult steps and variable costs and delayed transactions. Remittix could equal or exceed Pi's value growth by maintaining strategic partnership deals between merchants, remittance services as well as e-commerce platforms. Roadmap Highlights and Potential Catalysts The foundation of Remittix relies heavily on the natural buzz generated by its community members just like Pi Network. As well as building community buzz the initiative develops a regulatory-conscious framework to draw institutional support. Support from bigger organizations would grow through establishing clear legal guidelines with robust oversight mechanisms. The token price can jump rapidly if Remittix completes essential alliances which include facilitating immediate crypto payouts across gig-economy platforms. The future growth of the altcoin directly depends on how it implements its planned expansions. Many projects incur failure after making their expansion too rapid. Remittix will succeed by moving at a controlled speed and providing stable exchanges between crypto assets and demonstrating genuine use examples. The implementation of hyped-driven growth initiatives that extend beyond reasonable capacity boundaries leads to price drops. The token works to protect its clear mission through its focus on rapid settlements to build strong adoption of its users. Conclusion: A Potential Successor to Pi Network’s Leap A profitable launch takes place when token platforms create useful platforms which community support networks accept. The market has received a new promising technology called Remittix which enables digital currency use through standard shopping activities. The continuing success of the presale demonstrates widespread faith in the project from many people. The practical solutions that Remittix delivers create conditions for widespread mainstream adoption of its product even with rapidly changing markets. People who did not secure Pi's 1000% surge now have an opportunity to participate in Remittixgrowth as the project sets course for widespread adoption. Current success in presale indicates the potential for Remittix to become the anticipated breakthrough in cryptocurrency based on its roadmap's expected success and widespread payment demand.

He highlighted five cryptocurrencies: XRP (Ripple), Solana, Cardano (ADA), Bitcoin, and Ethereum. The crypto market, which often reacts strongly to the news, saw a 62% increase in the value of XRP, Solana, and ADA and a 10% rise in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Investing in these coins could be wise, as the administration plans to implement policies and regulations to support their growth. Let's look at them individually and why you should collect them after Trump’s mention. Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin is the first crypto coin released after the Satoshi paper. Despite breaking an all-time price high shortly after Trump’s election victory, it is expected to still rise in value thanks to Trump’s long-term crypto plans. Currently, the United States holds a large amount of BTC and is expected to buy more for its proposed reserve. Bitcoin is often regarded as digital gold because of its scarcity and potential for long-term growth. As a result, it is one of the most highly traded assets in crypto trading . It is also the most liquid coin, which makes it easy to buy and sell. Due to its wide adoption as a mode of payment, it is a great option for you. Bitcoin currently hovers around $86,636.54 as of the time of writing. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum is another cryptocurrency you should consider. It is known for its decentralisation and is second only to Bitcoin regarding market cap. ETH has many use cases, including earning on investments by staking , playing games, and interacting on social media. Its smart-contract characteristics help eliminate the need for intermediaries, a form of security for the coin. With a market capitalisation of about $261.95B and a price range of $2,172.12 per Ethereum, it is expected to attract major investors in light of Trump’s recent speech. The total supply of Ethereum is about 120 million and runs on about 15.8 transactions per second. Thanks to a proof-of-stake mechanism , it is energy efficient and perfect for building Dapps like NFTs and DeFi tokens. These features make ETH a credible addition to your portfolio at the moment. Ripple (XRP) Ripple’s XRP has been on several investors’ radars since former Securities and Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler stepped down. Buying XRP is a smart move due to the tokens' unique properties. It is one of the cryptocurrencies known for its international payment, and it is not mined like other coins; instead, it is obtained through a process known as a unique consensus mechanism. XRP's market capitalisation is about $145 billion, with a price of about $2.50 and a circulating supply of 57 billion. It has very fast translation speeds, and it is used mainly by big financial institutions for payments. Due to its low transaction cost, you could also use XRP for cross-border payments. Solana (SOL) Solana has many profitable prospects, as it has grown by over 11% in recent weeks. It has become a point of interest for savvy crypto investors after being mentioned by the president, and rightly so. It has a total supply of about 595 million Solana with a price tag of about $145.68. Its market capitalisation is about $73 billion, with about 65,000 transactions per second, which makes it very fast and highly scalable. You could also use Solana for the building of NFTs, just like ADA and ETH, and you also don’t have to worry about transaction fees as they are low. Are you thinking of a cryptocurrency that has short and long-term profit prospects? Solana is a good option. Cardano (ADA) Cardano’s ADA has powerful scaling properties, which is one reason you should consider collecting ADA. It was created using Proof of Stake ouroboros, which minimises energy consumption. This coin was launched in September 2017 and has about 35 billion ADA in circulation, with a current price of $0.87. Despite its current valuation per token, which stands at less than a dollar, it has a high propensity for growth in the long run. It has a market capitalisation of about $12.67 billion and plans to achieve about 1 million transactions per second. ADA allows easy interaction with other blockchains and uses smart contracts, which can be used to explore Dapps like NFTs. Criteria To Consider Before Collecting a Coin These five coins mentioned by the president of the US are viable crypto additions to your portfolio. Still, before acquiring them, you must ensure that the coins you acquire are perfect for your needs. Here are tips to help you make the right crypto investment choice: ● Adoption: Analyze how many people adopt the coin and what institution recognises it. A wide adoption can be social proof. ● Market trends: Check for the market trends of the coin you plan to invest in, as it will guide you on how the coin has been performing. Opting for a coin in the top market trend might be a good decision.● Price performance: Knowing the coin's previous and current price can also give you insight into its performance. Even though the price action might not reflect the coin's actual value, it can provide insight into its performance.● Utility: Knowing the coin's utility can help you discern the coin’s actual value. This can be obtained from its use cases. For example, if the coin’s ‘use cases’ improve, the coin will improve. You should also check the regulations governing each coin, as there can be different regulations pertaining to each. Why Now Might Be the Right Time To Invest in These Coins The market growth of the five coins shortly after the speech reflects that investment decisions are already moving towards the coins, and this could be the best time for you to invest in them. However, before you acquire anyone, ensure they have the utility, price performance and adoption that suit your purpose and satisfy your performance criteria.

Alphractal points to the Global Economic Policy Uncertainty Index and the Economic Policy Uncertainty Index for the United States, both of which are nearing their highest levels on record. Historically, such increases in uncertainty have been associated with higher market volatility and, in some cases, economic recessions. The Global Economic Policy Uncertainty Index is a measure of economic policy uncertainty across 20 major economies, taking into account media reports, forecast discrepancies, and tax law changes. A higher index value indicates greater uncertainty that could affect investment decisions, currency fluctuations, and broader financial markets. Related News: Watch Out: 23 Altcoins Have Massive Token Unlocks in the New Week - Here's the Day-by-Day, Hour-by-Hour List Similarly, the U.S. Economic Policy Uncertainty Index assesses uncertainty in the U.S. by analyzing media coverage, tax policy expirations, and changes in economic forecasts. Increases in this index have often preceded periods of economic turmoil and instability. Alphractal warns that increased economic uncertainty could increase volatility across multiple asset classes, including stocks, bonds, and cryptocurrencies. Historical trends suggest that increases in uncertainty often lead to significant market volatility, as seen in past economic crises when both the S&P 500 and Bitcoin (BTC) exhibited significant price swings. According to the analytics company, for cryptocurrency investors, these developments may indicate a period in which price movements will increase and market trends will be unpredictable. *This is not investment advice.

41780857,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=694125,1742171322,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/41780857.jpeg,Solana ($SOL) celebrates 5 years since its official launch,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/solana-sol-celebrates-5-years-since-launch/,"Blockchain platform Solana commemorates its fifth year in the crypto industry since launching in 2020. So far, the network has processed close to $410 billion worth of transactions with a little over 1300 validators. Not to mention, the ecosystem also boasts impressive DEX trading volumes, almost surpassing $1 trillion . Solana’s Gokal encourages the crypto community to launch their own tokens In an X post on March 16, Solana acknowledged its developers and founders who worked hard to build the network and even suggested that the platform has more projects lined up for the crypto community. Co-founder Raj Gokal also commented, leaning towards encouraging developers to introduce their own tokens. He stated, “If we could launch then, you can launch now.” Gokal recalled what was happening on planet Earth at this time five years ago, when everyone around the world was on lockdown and projects, especially crypto, were being cancelled one by one. Anatoly Yakovenko, Solana’s co-founder, also joined in the celebration, wishing all the platform’s enthusiasts worldwide a happy Solana 0 block day. Yakovenko also said that everything was going according to plan, and looking at the characteristics of SOL as a blockchain, few people would argue with this. Solana’s ecosystem still has over $8.5 billion in total value locked in DeFi protocols, having handled more than $408 billion in transactions. Moreover, the network’s fees and revenues are more than double that of Ethereum, and the SOL token has just over $65.5 billion in market cap. SOL could surge past the $300 mark in September 2025 Solana’s price has been under pressure, plunging from $180 in February to current levels below $140. The token’s price slid slightly by 5.67% in the last 24 hours, trading at only $126.83 . The futures market provides a similar snapshot. Funding rates on SOL perpetual futures have been negative for three days, and short sellers are currently paying to hold their positions — an indication of little demand for leveraged long positions. Perhaps more worrying, accumulation has stalled. The total number of Solana wallets holding at least 10,000 SOL fell from 5,053 to 5,023, a signal some large investors may be cashing out or reducing exposure. Analysts believe that SOL has enough room to recover despite steps taken down in the last few days. They even forecast a 10% surge over the next month and a new record by the end of the year. Experts also expect the token’s price to range between $127.50 and $150.14 and have an ROI of 12.76% in the three-month period ending June. They even estimate the token’s average price of $135.99. Some even project that the asset will be trading far above $300 by September 2025. On the other hand, some have estimated prices to oscillate at somewhere between $235.73 and $311.32, with an ROI of at least 133%. Firedancer upgrade set to boost Solana’s speed and stability The next major milestone for Solana’s blockchain is expected to be the launch of Jump Crypto’s Firedancer client—an alternative high-performance validator designed to enhance the network’s transaction throughput and resilience against threats and outages. A testnet version and a prototype mainnet iteration called Frankendancer were introduced in September 2023. Though its launch was originally planned for the second quarter of 2024, Firedancer is widely expected to launch in full this year. Helius co-founder Mert Memtaz, a significant figure in the Solana community, predicted in December that Firedancer will go live “end of Q2.” The upgrade is expected to help Solana scale towards its goal of 1 million transactions per second (TPS). Meanwhile, Solana could also be approved for inclusion in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in 2024. According to The Block’s ETF tracking data, several asset managers have filed for Solana-based ETFs. Analysts have identified Solana—alongside Litecoin, Dogecoin, and XRP—as a strong contender for ETF approval. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

UK Royal Court of Appeal Judge Christopher Nugee knocked back Howells’ application, stating that there was no “real prospect of success” and there was “no other compelling reason” as to why it should be heard, according to a March 13 filing shared with Cointelegraph. Source: James Howells Nugee’s decision follows an earlier dismissal on Jan. 9 from High Court Judge Andrew Keyser, who similarly said there was “no realistic prospect” of Howells’ case succeeding at a full trial. In a note to Cointelegraph, Howell said his “last legal option” to exhaust is at the ECHR — where he will claim that the UK High Court and UK Court of Appeal breached his right to property and right to a fair trial under Article 1 of Protocol 1 and Article 6 of the ECHR. “The British establishment want to sweep this under the carpet, and i will not let them. It will not go away — no matter how long it takes!” The ECHR cannot overrule a UK court decision — however, a verdict in Howells’ favor would call on the UK courts to consider whether its legislation was interpreted in a way that is compatible with the ECHR’s provisions. In a separate statement shared with Cointelegraph, Howells said he would file a claim to the ECHR in the “coming weeks.” The court filings follow repeated rejections from the Newport City Council allowing Howells to search through the Docksway landfill — where Howells’ former partner disposed of a bag containing the hard drive at the site in 2013.

Individuals who ignored it at the right moment regretted missing out on massive profits later on. Remittix (RTX), at present, is on the same journey and offering a revolutionary payment solution on blockchain. RTX offers an actual use-case unlike speculative tokens and ranks as one of the most promising options in the industry right now. As Remittix snowballs along, many think RTX might be the next big star in the digital finance universe. Will traders miss out on another project with enormous adoption prospects yet again, or will RTX eclipse the success of Pi Coin? Pi Coin’s Journey: A Lesson in Missed Opportunities The current Pi Coin (PI) price is $1.45, a drop of 0.83%. Despite the drop in value, Pi Coin has attained a market cap of $10.06 billion, an indicator that risk-taking early investors are being rewarded. Source: Tradingview It nevertheless had a skeptical reception at launch and most people dismissed it as another experiment. It grew its network in due course of time and those who invested early reaped an immense profit from it. Unfortunately, most people didn't appreciate its rise to success and only noticed its value when it was too late. Now that Remittix (RTX) begins to ascend, investors are observing closely, determined not to make the same mistake. Why Remittix (RTX) Could Be the Next Big Crypto Remittix (RTX) is in the news as a blockchain-based financial platform that provides fee-free and real-time cryptocurrency-fiat transactions. RTX currently trades at $0.0734 and raised $13.9 million and sold 520 million tokens, reflecting strong investor interest. Compared to Pi Coin, which built its network through mobile mining, RTX is being built with use in the real world in mind. A US-based freelancer who does work for clients in Europe, for instance, can use RTX to receive payment instantly, avoiding banking commissions and settlement times. RTX is consequently a practical financial tool rather than a speculative vehicle. PayFi model of RTX provides a new standard in cryptocurrency payments and finds itself as one of the most promising blockchain payment prospects out there. Can Remittix (RTX) Outperform Pi Coin? The popularity of Pi Coin demonstrates blockchain innovations' potential for mass adoption, but Remittix (RTX) has something even better—actual use cases in the real world. While Pi Coin's development falls behind, RTX is seeing real-world adoption and is thus a high-growth investment opportunity. Unlike speculative meme coins or projects with questionable use cases, RTX is solving a global financial problem. Businesses, freelancers, and merchants are turning to RTX for seamless digital payments, and that's what's fueling its growing adoption. As the use of cryptocurrency keeps on increasing, the chances of RTX surpassing Pi Coin in market cap and growth in value improve by the day. With increasing use of cryptocurrency, RTX could be one of the largest winners in 2025. Why Now Is the Best Time to Invest in RTX Investors who missed Pi Coin’s early rise are now looking at Remittix (RTX) as a second chance. With its crypto-to-fiat payment system, RTX is attracting serious attention from investors and businesses alike. Unlike other speculative assets, RTX offers real-world financial applications, making it one of the most promising blockchain investments today. As more companies integrate crypto payments, RTX’s value is expected to rise significantly. For those looking for the next big opportunity, RTX presents a rare chance to get in early before mainstream adoption takes off. Invest in the Future of Blockchain Payments with Remittix (RTX) With Remittix gaining momentum, many investors are turning to RTX as the next major force in blockchain finance. Its focus on instant, low-cost transactions makes it a strong alternative to traditional banking systems. Pi Coin taught investors that early adoption in promising blockchain projects can lead to massive gains. Now, RTX is proving to be the next major opportunity in crypto payments. As blockchain adoption accelerates, RTX is positioning itself as a leader in financial technology, making it one of the most exciting crypto investments of the decade.
