41773764,https://coinpaprika.com/news/libra-creator-hayden-davis-linked-to-wolf-token-amid-new-controversy,1742160476,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/41773764.jpeg,LIBRA Creator Hayden Davis Linked to WOLF Token Amid New Controversy,https://coinpaprika.com/news/libra-creator-hayden-davis-linked-to-wolf-token-amid-new-controversy,"Hayden Davis, the controversial creator of the LIBRA meme coin, has been linked to a new token called WOLF , which shares similarities with his past projects. Blockchain analysis from Bubblemaps revealed that 82% of WOLF’s supply was controlled by a small group of wallets, fueling suspicions of insider manipulation. This development comes as Argentine authorities continue investigating Davis for his involvement in the LIBRA scandal. Davis launched WOLF around the time that Jordan Belfort, the real-life ""Wolf of Wall Street,"" was rumored to be introducing a meme coin under the same name. The sudden buzz around WOLF drew attention from traders, particularly the WallStreetBets (WSB) community, sending its market cap surging to $40 million. However, just like previous Davis-related tokens, WOLF’s price plummeted soon after, with analysts suspecting a rug pull. Blockchain data indicated that the token’s supply was funneled through a web of addresses before leading back to a wallet linked to Davis. Blockchain analytics firm Bubblemaps tracked the movement of WOLF’s funds and found that they had been transferred across 17 wallets and five different blockchains before arriving at a single address identified as belonging to Davis. The similarities between WOLF and his past projects, including MELANIA and LIBRA, further reinforced suspicions of a pattern of coordinated token launches followed by price crashes. Davis has a history of controversial meme coin projects. LIBRA, one of his previous tokens, became a political scandal when Argentine President Javier Milei briefly endorsed it. This endorsement sent the token’s value skyrocketing past $4 billion before it collapsed, wiping out nearly all of its value. Blockchain analysts discovered that key insiders, who had acquired large amounts of LIBRA before Milei’s endorsement, quickly sold their holdings for over $100 million, leaving retail investors at a loss. Davis later admitted to playing a role in the LIBRA project and also confessed to launching a meme coin associated with former US First Lady Melania Trump. His involvement in multiple meme coin controversies has drawn legal attention, particularly from Argentine authorities who have launched an official investigation into the LIBRA case. The fallout from LIBRA has also led Argentine lawyer Gregorio Dalbon to call for an Interpol Red Notice against Davis, which could result in his arrest and possible extradition. Critics argue that Davis' continued involvement in the crypto space raises concerns about the lack of oversight in meme coin projects. The rapid creation of tokens, often associated with high-profile names, has become a strategy to generate market hype before an eventual collapse. These tactics have repeatedly left investors holding worthless tokens while a select few profit significantly. The growing scrutiny around Davis’ actions reflects broader concerns about the risks associated with meme coins and the need for regulatory oversight. Many traders remain drawn to the speculative nature of these projects, but the repeated pattern of sudden crashes has raised red flags within the cryptocurrency community. As legal pressure mounts, it remains unclear whether Davis will face consequences for his role in these projects. While some argue that buyers should conduct thorough research before investing in highly speculative tokens, others believe that stricter regulations are needed to prevent high-profile manipulations like the ones Davis has been accused of orchestrating. The case of WOLF serves as another example of the volatility and unpredictability of the meme coin market. While meme coins continue to attract traders looking for quick profits, the risks associated with unverified projects remain high. With authorities increasingly scrutinizing such schemes, the future of unchecked meme coin launches may be in question.",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-16 21:27:56

The streamer says she was held at gunpoint by several individuals demanding that she hand over the private keys to her crypto. According to Fox 26 , the suspects include Dylan Nesho Campbell, Bryan Anthony Salazar Guerrero and two additional suspects between the ages of 16-17. Campbell and Guerrero were each charged with aggravated kidnapping and aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon, as was the 17-year-old suspect. Siragusa reported that several armed individuals entered her home late at night on March 2, beat her, and held her at gunpoint, demanding her cryptocurrency. Source: Amouranth Luckily, her husband was on speakerphone, which the gunmen took in an attempt to access a crypto app. The husband, having been alerted to the situation, grabbed a handgun while attempting to gauge where the armed men were in the home. The online streamer led the assailants around the home and convinced them to start looking for a cold storage device. As the armed robbers were looking for the device, Siragusa ran upstairs to her husband, who was also watching the situation unfold on the home's network of cameras. Once she was safely upstairs, her husband fired off three rounds at assailants, likely shooting one in the process before the home invaders retreated and law enforcement arrived at the scene. Siragusa’s husband later revealed that he was the one posting from her account as the incident unfolded. Source: Amouranth The streamer previously disclosed that she held roughly 211 Bitcoin, worth over $20 million in November 2024, to online followers — making her a target for armed robbery.

However, volatility and uncertainty have dominated the market since the start of the month, keeping LINK’s price action unstable. Related Reading: Cardano Is ‘About To Break Free’ – Breakout Above Crucial Supply To Trigger A Big Move–Analyst The token has seen wild price swings, moving from $17 down to $13, briefly rebounding to $16, and then collapsing to a low of $11.8. Bulls are now fighting to push LINK back above the $15 mark, but momentum remains weak, and the market appears to be consolidating around current levels. Despite this uncertainty, on-chain data is showing promising signs. Metrics from Santiment reveal that 640,000 LINK were pulled off exchanges in the last 24 hours, which is typically a bullish signal. Large withdrawals from exchanges often indicate long-term accumulation, as investors move their holdings into private wallets instead of keeping them available for immediate selling. With exchange outflows rising, traders are watching closely to see if LINK can break through resistance levels and confirm a shift toward bullish momentum. The next few trading sessions will be key in determining whether LINK can recover or if further consolidation is ahead. Uncertainty Looms As Investors Watch For A Breakout Chainlink is currently holding above the $13.5 mark, struggling to reclaim higher levels as selling pressure and market uncertainty persist. Despite its recent recovery attempts, LINK remains stuck below key resistance, making investors cautious about its short-term direction. Analysts and traders are concerned about a potential drop below the current range, as on-chain metrics suggest a distribution phase may be unfolding. If LINK fails to hold its support zone, it could see renewed selling pressure, sending the price toward lower demand levels. However, not all signals are bearish. Crypto expert Ali Martinez shared Santiment data on X, revealing that 640,000 LINK were pulled off exchanges in the last 24 hours. This is often seen as a bullish indicator, as large investors typically withdraw their holdings from exchanges when they anticipate higher prices in the future. When whales and long-term holders accumulate, it reduces selling pressure on the market and strengthens price stability. If LINK manages to break key resistance levels, this accumulation trend could set the stage for a strong recovery rally.

The next few days will be critical as investors watch for a breakout or further downside movement. Chainlink Bulls Defend Key Support Levels Chainlink (LINK) is currently trading at $14, facing resistance at the $15 level as bulls struggle to reclaim higher ground. The market remains under pressure, and LINK must hold current levels to avoid a deeper correction. For a recovery rally to take shape, bulls need to defend the $13 support zone and build momentum toward a breakout above $15. If LINK successfully pushes past this resistance, the next major target is the $17 level, where it must reclaim the 200-day moving average (MA) and the exponential moving average (EMA) to confirm a bullish trend reversal. However, if LINK fails to hold its current support levels, selling pressure could intensify, driving the price toward the $10 range or even lower levels. This would put LINK in a deeper downtrend, making a short-term recovery more difficult.

The Best Meme Coins for Exponential Returns include Arctic Pablo Coin , a thrilling adventure-themed crypto, Official Melania, a politically charged meme token, and Shiba Inu, the legendary Dogecoin rival. Each of these coins brings something unique to the table, whether it’s a high-stakes presale, community-driven growth, or a strong ecosystem. Investors are eyeing these trending meme coins for their potential to deliver massive returns, making them some of the hottest opportunities in the market right now. Arctic Pablo Coin: The Best New Meme Coin for Exponential Returns on an Icy Adventure Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) isn’t just another meme coin presale ; it’s one of the Best New Meme Coins for Exponential Returns, inviting investors on an exhilarating expedition led by the intrepid explorer, Arctic Pablo. This narrative-driven cryptocurrency transforms the investment journey into a thrilling adventure, blending storytelling with financial opportunity. Unlike traditional presales divided into stages, Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale is structured around unique locations, each representing a chapter in Pablo’s quest. Currently, in its 14th location, Frosty Falls, $APC is priced at $0.000074 per token. Early investors have already raised over $1.88 million, anticipating a remarkable 10,694.59% return on investment when the coin lists at $0.008. This innovative approach not only adds excitement but also makes Arctic Pablo Coin one of the Best New Meme Coins for Exponential Returns, as each location unlocks new opportunities for investors. To enhance scarcity and value, Arctic Pablo Coin employs a deflationary mechanism by burning unsold tokens weekly during the presale. This strategy ensures that the total supply decreases over time, potentially increasing the value of remaining tokens. All burn transactions are transparently recorded on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), reinforcing trust within the community. Investors can further benefit from staking their $APC tokens, earning a generous 66% Annual Percentage Yield (APY).

But will the price cross the much anticipated $1 mark this year? This has been the main focus of much of the debate on the price these last few weeks, especially as the price showed a strong bearish hit in the last few months. However, while the price hitting $1 has seen much debate, some analysts have started speculating that Remittix might hit the $1 mark before Shiba Inu. But seeing that the Remittix token is a more recent addition to the market, could the Remittixprice growth cause it to hit $1 before a top option like the Shiba Inu? When is Shiba Inu Price Hitting $1? The Shiba Inu price has been in a negative direction since the start of this year, dropping as low as 52% in the last 90 days. This is even a fair value due to its recent growth in the last 7 days, which saw it end the week at 2.7% growth. Overall, the price outlook of the coin reflected that it has been on a bearish move for the last 4 months. However, using the recent price change, is the Shiba Inu price showing a possible price jump towards $1 soon? There was a strong bearish impact on the Shiba Inu price earlier this year due to the surge in meme coins, which has slowed the growth of the Shiba coin. But, following the slight change in direction in the last few days, the Shiba Inu daily chart shows the coin on an uptrend seen from the breakout above the 7 SMA. However, it is too early to take this growth literally to mean the price is heading toward a new high. The Shiba Inu price chart shows that there are still a couple of levels that could show strong resistance for the coin to break. Some of the notable resistance to break includes the current zone at $0.00001270, the $0.00002021 zone, $0.00003075, and the old ATH at $0.00008846. Breaking these zones could help the Shiba Inu coin cancel out some zeros, but the $1 range could still be far-reaching and might not be possible this year. Remittix Stays Closer to Hitting $1 This Year The Remittix token has been the talk of top analysts for the past few weeks, as the new token continues to wow investors and critics with its growth so far. While the Remittix presale round gets closer every day to its final lap, the price growth has not shown any sign of slowing down. Currently, the funds raised in the Remittix ICO have hit a new high of almost $13.9M, showing the resilience and strong potential of this new token. However, while the Remittix token continues to look like it can only keep going up, what does the future look like after its presale round? The Remittix token, being a big project of the Remittix exchange, has been designed to get strong backing from the exchange. The Remittix exchange, however, is a new crypto solution changing the dynamics of crypto-FIAT payment. This solution helps users convert and send cryptocurrencies from their wallet directly to a bank account cheaply and faster. This new solution in the crypto market and the projected high demand for the exchange service by individuals and businesses are what analysts believe will keep driving the Remittixprice up. Although the presale price of the Remittix token is currently $0.0734, it is projected to see a surge of over 50x after launching, meaning the price will grow 50 times. This could easily take the Remittix price over $1 before the end of this year. This would be a great opportunity to take advantage of the Remittix token price now, which is less than $1.

As several projects struggle with volatility, investors are now taking a hard look at cryptocurrencies quietly reaching milestones. One such project, the Pi Coin, just had its sixth birthday, attracting investors' interest. However, another token , Remittix, remains in the shadows and might have greater potential. Pi Coin Celebrates Big Milestones—What Does It Mean for Investors? Currently priced at around $1.4, Pi Network celebrated its sixth birthday recently , with two milestones: the Mainnet migration completion and the successful launch of Open Network PiFest. These steps reflect the platform's maturity and increasing adoption. Pi Network's recent auctions of the.pi domain are strengthening its ecosystem, bringing in real-world use cases. Price action is still mixed, with Pi Coin trading between $1.20 and $1.90 as the community raises concerns about stringent KYC verification policies. Pi Coin bull investors are hopeful that upcoming exchange listings and additional adoption can boost the token exponentially. Some predictors even estimate prices to rise as high as $200-$500 in 2030 if the market environment is favorable. But dangers do lurk. Falling below the key support of $1.20 would take Pi Coin downwards, and wary investors would shy away from committing themselves fully. Pi has to keep up the momentum in order not to fall into bearishness. Source: Tradingview Remittix Shines as a Hidden Gem at $0.0734 Despite the success of the Pi Coin, Remittix is quietly building itself into a crypto market dark horse. With a current price of $0.0734, Remittix is making headlines with its revolutionary PayFiprotocol. Already having raised close to $13.9 million in its presale phase, Remittix sent over 520 million tokens into wallets, reflecting the rising popularity. Apparently, investors are impressed by the real-world functionality delivered by the project and have expressed huge confidence in its development prospects. Compared to other altcoins, Remittix simplifies payments in cryptocurrency. People can send cryptocurrency and convert it instantly into their currency in the real world, solving one of cryptocurrency's biggest problems: utilizing it in the real world. Consider an Ethiopian coffee exporter who receives payment from Europe and North America. Gains in most instances are lost due to delayed wire transfers and costly conversions leading to loss and lateness. Remittix receives such payments in real-time and remits them directly into cash currency in the local country. This easy solution aside from saving expense also saves efficiency and this is why businesses use Remittix over other payment systems. To this end, Remittix raised close to $13.9 million in its presale process by selling over a half a billion tokens. These figures show immense investor support for the Remittix cause and set it up for immense growth this year. Contrary to the majority of hype tokens, Remittix adoption comes as a result of practical use and thus remains very attractive to investors in times of volatile markets. Remittix Could Be the Crypto Star of 2025 As investors evaluate Pi Coin and similar projects, Remittix’s practical approach to digital payments positions it uniquely. Its growing popularity among merchants and individual users illustrates a genuine market need. Remittix’s PayFi protocol addresses real-world problems, such as delays, high fees, and exchange rate losses. This creates consistent demand even when broader markets fluctuate. Given its strong early performance, Remittix could easily become one of this year’s breakout stars. Investors looking for stability and tangible benefits should seriously consider this promising newcomer in crypto. Ready to explore the token analysts call the hidden gem of 2025? Visit Remittix to discover how its PayFi approach is changing cross-border transactions and why investors are jumping in early.

The rapid growth of Pi Coin got attention in the past but Remittix (RTX) stands as a rising contender that demands increasing attention. The directed strategy combined with practical financial solution development at Remittix positions it to have stronger prospects than Pi Network despite recent challenges. A Tough Stretch for Pi Coin The coin price for Pi Coin experienced downward trends throughout recent weeks.

At the time when these price decreases happened Pi Coin held between $1.43 and $1.59 trading rates before dropping to about 51% under its $2.99 highest mark in history on CoinGecko records. source: coingecko.com The value decline becomes associated with continuous obstacles throughout the Pi Network.

Numerous users of Pi Coin encountered significant difficulties during the mainnet migration because of KYC and technical problems and token transfer issues.

Remittix (RTX) is the one to watch in 2025. Its innovative crypto-to-fiat conversion system is going to completely rethink cross-border transactions as we know them. Read on to learn more about the token. Polygon (POL) Suffers Massive Price Decline As 99% of Polygon's (POL) holders experience price loss, the slide of Polygon toward $0.21 keeps on. Over a 24-hour period, the blockchain lost $13.2 million worth of liquidity, which strengthens forecasts of a continuous downward market trend. Prices have decreased by 34.45% monthly during this time of extreme withdrawal, hence market players are hurrying to identify fresh investment prospects. Polygon's declining price does not exhibit any indication of a transient development. The Artemis data reveals a constant negative flow of money from its chain network, therefore indicating general declining confidence within its network. Most POL token holders now find themselves in a hazardous scenario and run the risk of losing their funds. Open Interest dropped 1.29% in futures markets at the same time trade volume increased by 73% to suggest aggressive short-positioning activity. The technical study shows unfavorabletrends because POL approaches the February key support level. Remittix Is Set To Surge Providing fast and reasonably priced cross-border solutions, Remittix (RTX) is redefining global payments by aggregating FIAT transactions with blockchain technologies. Supported by more than forty cryptocurrencies, the platform provides rapid translations into FIAT currencies like USD and GBP, therefore enabling simple bank account deposits. Remittix is the better alternative to conventional payment providers like Stripe and Wise. As a link between crypto and FIAT, both crypto-exclusive systems like Coinbase Wallet and Remittix guarantee accessibility and inclusivity for companies and people by supporting over 50 crypto pairs and 30+ FIAT currencies, simplifying world trade. Notable also is the platform's open flat-fee approach, which offers savings and transparency over absurd rates of exchange of conventional banks. In the payments industry, Remittix is revolutionary since this approach guarantees that the whole amount transferred reaches the recipient, therefore addressing unethical activity all too often. Why Now Is The Best Time To Buy Remittix At $0.0734 in the presale stage, the RTX coin offers a good investment potential. Forecasts reveal an interesting rise; demand for innovative cross-border payment solutions is generating a 25x multiplier in the presale phase and over 1,500% increases following launch.

Imagine getting into a meme coin early, riding the wave, and cashing out with a life-changing 3650% ROI. The meme market is heating up with the top new meme coins to join in March 2025, and the best part? Some of the biggest gainers of 2025 haven’t even hit the mainstream yet. While everyone scrambles to chase old projects, smart investors are already stacking up presale gems that could explode. BTFD Coin (BTFD) is thriving with a potential moonshot to $0.006, making waves with its Bulls Squad community and high-stakes referral program. Add in the explosive Pudgy Penguins and Peanut the Squirrel, and you’ve got a power trio primed for massive gains. Let’s dive into why these are the top new meme coins to join in March 2025 before the next big pump. 1. BTFD Coin (BTFD) – The 3650% ROI Beast With a Bulls Squad Ready to Charge If you’ve ever missed a life-changing meme coin rally, BTFD is handing you a second chance on a silver platter. This isn’t just another presale—it’s a full-fledged movement built around the legendary Buy The Dip mindset. While the market panics, BTFD holders are buying in, stacking up, and charging straight to the moon with this top new meme coin to join in March 2025. Currently, in its 14th presale stage, BTFD Coin is already making headlines, having raised over $6.32 million with 11,400+ holders locking in their positions. The current price sits at $0.00016, but once the presale ends, BTFD will launch at $0.0006—meaning anyone investing today could triple their money before it even hits exchanges. Now, let’s talk numbers. Suppose you throw in $13,500 at $0.00016 per coin. That bags you 84.375 million BTFD tokens . When BTFD reaches its projected $0.006 moonshot, that stack would be worth a jaw-dropping $506,250! Even if you’re aiming for the short-term, by presale launch at $0.0006, your bag still turns into $50,625—insane gains for an early entry. But BTFD isn’t just about price speculation. The Bulls Squad—featuring Baby Bull, Raging Bull, Nerdy Bull, and Peoples Bull—has created a strong community-driven ecosystem with staking, a 90% APY, and an engaging Play-to-Earn (P2E) game that lets you earn rewards while having fun. The full version of the BTFD game is now live, bringing even more utility and engagement to the project. And if you love making money while doing nothing, BTFD’s Referral Rewards Program lets you earn 10% in BTFD tokens when people use your referral code. If you’re in the top 20 referrers by the end of the month, you’re stacking even more rewards. Why is BTFD shining bright among the top new meme coins to join in March 2025? No meme coin presale right now has this level of community hype, staking rewards, and explosive potential. 2. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) – The NFT King Entering the Meme Coin Space Pudgy Penguins has already cemented itself as an NFT blue-chip, but its entrance into the meme coin world has flipped the script. The project’s expansion from NFTs to crypto tokens is bringing millions of dollars in liquidity, backed by a loyal community of die-hard holders who won’t let it sink. The Pudgy Penguins meme coin is all about interoperability between NFTs and DeFi. Holders can stake, earn, and participate in ecosystem growth while reaping benefits from an already thriving brand. With exclusive NFT integration and limited-edition token airdrops, this is more than just another meme coin—it’s a full-blown Web3 economy. Why does PENGU deserve a spot among the top new meme coins to join in March 2025? Because it’s merging two of crypto’s hottest sectors—NFTs and meme coins—in a way that few have ever pulled off. 3. Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) – The Meme Coin With a Nuts Community If you think meme coins are just a trend, the Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) community is here to prove you wrong. This meme project skyrocketed after its Coinbase listing, and despite market dips, its engagement remains stronger than ever. The secret? A community-first approach with a hilarious, meme-worthy brand that keeps investors engaged. PNUT has built its reputation with interactive community events, staking rewards, and influencer-driven growth. Unlike other meme coins that rely purely on hype, Peanut the Squirrel actually delivers fun utility, and value. From exclusive airdrops to partnerships in the NFT space, PNUT is positioning itself as a long-term player in the meme coin world. Why is PNUT worth watching besides the top new meme coins to join in March 2025? Because while other meme coins fade, this one has a community so strong, that they’d rather hoard PNUT than sell it. Final Thoughts – The Window to Huge Gains is Closing Fast! Meme coins aren’t just for laughs anymore—they’re making life-changing money for early investors. If you’re looking for top new meme coins to join in March 2025, these three are leading the charge. BTFD Coin is already turning heads with its 3650% ROI potential, Pudgy Penguins is breaking boundaries with NFT integration, and Peanut the Squirrel is proving that community-backed projects thrive even in rough markets. But here’s the deal—these opportunities won’t stay at these prices for long. BTFD is already in Stage 14, and once the presale ends, the price jumps to $0.0006. If you want to maximize your gains, now’s the time to get in before the window slams shut. The meme coin boom of 2025 is just getting started, and only those who act fast will be the ones cashing out when the real fireworks begin.

BTFD’s referral program lets users earn 10% in BTFD tokens when someone uses their referral code to invest. If you’re in the top 20 referrers, you get even bigger rewards. The leaderboard resets monthly, so the more you refer, the more you earn! Why is BTFD’s Bulls Squad important for the community? The Bulls Squad is the backbone of BTFD, representing the strongest diamond-hand community in the presale. Baby Bull, Raging Bull, Nerdy Bull, and Peoples Bull, it create a fun, engaging, and community-driven movement rather than just another meme coin. What makes Pudgy Penguins different from other meme coins? Pudgy Penguins isn’t just a meme coin—it’s backed by a blue-chip NFT project with massive brand recognition. It bridges the gap between NFTs and crypto, providing exclusive staking benefits, airdrops, and DeFi integrations. How can Peanut the Squirrel keep its momentum? PNUT thrives on a powerful community, influencer backing, and real utility. With its Coinbase listing, staking rewards, and NFT partnerships, it continues to evolve while keeping investors engaged with regular events and token burns. Is investing in meme coin presales safer than buying after launch? Yes! Presales offer lower entry prices, protect against market volatility, and provide exclusive rewards. BTFD’s presale, for example, lets investors triple their money before listing—a massive advantage over post-launch buyers.

WIF could reach a maximum price of $3.98 by the end of 2028. By 2031, WIF’s price may surge to $6.46. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to the crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins hitting the market afterwards. Dogwifhat has thus far recorded significant feats in terms of valuation and exchange listing. The token approached the $5 mark on March 31, 2024 ($4.58B market cap), saw massive price movements after the November U.S. elections, and got listed on Binance US, Coinbase, KuCoin, Robinhood, and more. However, a massive bear market ensued, and WIF lost momentum. Leaving investors asking: How high can dogwifhat crypto go? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs). Overview Cryptocurrency Dogwifhat Ticker WIF Current price $0.464 Market cap $463,862,590.8 Trading volume $170.73M Circulating supply 998,840,965.85 WIF All-time high $4.85 on March 31, 2024 All-time low $0.000023 on November 2023 24-hour high $0.5022 24-hour low $0.4638 Dogwifhat price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 13.61% 50-day SMA $0.791 14-Day RSI 38.86 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 30 (Fear) Green days 12/30 (30%) 200-Day SMA $1.903 Dogwifhat (WIF) price analysis: WIF sees minor gains, bullish reversal imminent? TL;DR Breakdown WIF shows signs of recovery in the short term but is not yet significant. Dogwifhat (WIF) resistance is present at around $0.528. WIF’s immediate support level is present at $0.429. Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart: WIF faces rejection at $0.528 WIF/USDT is in a downtrend on March 16 after facing rejection at $0.528 on the previous two candlesticks. The MACD is slightly bullish, suggesting potential for a rebound, and the RSI (37.87) shows neutral to oversold condition. If $0.429 holds, a recovery toward $0.528, $0.601 or $0.649 is possible. A breakdown below $0.429 could lead to further declines. WIF faces rejection at $0.528 Dogwifhat price analysis 4-hour chart: WIF to retest $0.492 soon? The 4-hour WIF/USDT shows a clear decline in price, though with some recovery brewing. Dogwifhat currently trades just above the lower Bollinger Band (a short-term support level). A bounce from this level could lead to another attempt at the $0.492 resistance level. WIF to retest $0.492 soon? The MFI reflects a seller-dominated market, while the Balance of Power (BOP) suggests a bullish bias, though not significantly overwhelming the selling pressure. To confirm the position of the BOP indicator, WIF needs to recapture the $0.492 price level and break past resistance at $0.525. Dogwifhat technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.8692 SELL SMA 5 $0.7200 SELL SMA 10 $0.7153 SELL SMA 21 $0.6470 SELL SMA 50 $0.7912 SELL SMA 100 $1.4255 SELL SMA 200 $1.9036 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.6153 SELL EMA 5 $0.7531 SELL EMA 10 $1.0408 SELL EMA 21 $1.4250 SELL EMA 50 $1.9466 SELL EMA 100 $2.21 SELL EMA 200 $2.25 SELL What to expect from WIF price analysis? The broader outlook for WIF is bearish. In the meantime, a recapture and break out of the $0.492 – $0.528 price level is needed to confirm a possible bullish reversal, while a long-term push above $0.649 could signal a sustainable uptrend. A failed bullish attempt could result in further price declines towards $0.395. Is Dogwifhat crypto a good investment? Dogwifhat (WIF) is a meme coin on the Solana blockchain. Its value is driven by community interest and speculation. Projections indicate that by 2025, the price could recover to about $1 to $1.5. While it may have potential for short-term gains, it’s equally risky. Only invest after thorough research. Where to buy WIF? Currently, traders and investors can buy Dogwifhat (WIF) on these CEXs: Binance, Binance.US, Raydium, Coinbase Exchange, Gate.io, KuCoin, Crypto.com Exchange, MEXC, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, LBank and several other s . Why is $WIF down? WIF is down after recently facing rejection at $0.529. The coin is down due to diminishing market interest and folding liquidity triggered by massive selloffs and a shift to other assets that investors consider more profitable. Dogwifhat (WIF) price chart | Coinmarketcap Dogwifhat (WIF) price chart | Coinmarketcap Will WIF reach $10? Having reached a peak price of $4.85 in 2024, the $10 target might not be too far-fetched. Can Dogwifhat reach $100? Dogwifhat (WIF) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and could be unlikely. Its market must be at least $99.9 billion – a value that exceeds the highest market cap ever for a meme (Dogecoin) at $88.79 billion. DOGE’s marketcap history | GlobalData Does WIF have a good long-term future? WIF has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of about $1.2 by the end of 2025 and about $5 to $7 by 2031. However, as with all meme coins, WIF’s future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support.

According to the announcement , the initiative could first be in a three-year experimental regime. The banking institution’s idea is to enable crypto trading for only those Russian investors who have at least 100 million rubles (or $1.1 million) in securities and deposits or whose annual income in the previous year exceeded 50 million rubles (approximately $570,000). The proposal allows entities categorized as qualified investors under current legislation to participate in the experiment. The Bank of Russia also aims to establish certain regulatory requirements for financial organizations willing to adopt cryptocurrency. The introduction of this regime could increase market transparency, offer more opportunities for experienced investors who are open to taking on higher risks, and establish clear standards. In the past, Russia’s central bank has repeatedly warned that cryptocurrencies are not issued or guaranteed by any jurisdiction and are notorious for their enhanced volatility. As such, investors should be aware that entering the ecosystem might result in crucial losses. The banking institution still does not recognize the asset class as a means of payment. That said, it proposed banning transactions between residents involving cryptocurrencies outside the experimental regime and enforcing penalties for violating this rule. On the other hand, multiple reports have emerged since Russia’s ‘special military operation’ against Ukraine that started over three years ago that local firms, as well as the government, are using crypto to bypass Western sanctions.

As Ripple advances its legal battle and files new trademarks, how will XRP markets react in the week ahead? Ripple (XRP) Tumbles 8% to End 4-Day Winning Streak Ripple (XRP) emerged as one of the top-performing assets last week, fueled by renewed optimism in Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). On Thursday, FOX analysts reported that the SEC is considering classifying XRP as a commodity as part of ongoing settlement negotiations to conclude the long-running case against Ripple. The SEC is reportedly using Ethereum’s current regulatory treatment as a benchmark in its deliberations. Ripple (XRP) Price Action | March 16 If this reclassification materialises, it could significantly enhance XRP’s prospects for ETF approval and potential inclusion in a strategic crypto reserve. However, after four consecutive days of green candles for Ripple price , driven by the SEC reclassification speculations, another major regulatory headline appears to have cut the XRP price rally short. Why Is XRP Price Going Down Today? After a four-day winning streak fueled by speculation that the SEC may classify XRP as a commodity, another major SEC announcement appears to have halted the rally. On Friday, March 14, the SEC announced its decision to pause the approval process for altcoin ETFs , triggering a downturn in the prices of top altcoins over the weekend, particularly those with ETF filings in progress. This development partly explains why XRP’s price has now plunged 8%, dropping from its Friday peak of $2.49 to $2.29 as of March 16. Derivatives Market Analysis Flashing Early Rebound Signals Despite the recent price dip, XRP’s derivatives market metrics indicate that bullish sentiment may still be in play. First, the latest Coinglass data shows, XRP’s trading volume has increased by 12.11%, reaching $6.05 billion. This suggests that despite the price pullback, there is still significant market activity. Ripple (XRP) Derivatives Market Analysis | Source: Coinglass Also, the 24-hour liquidation data (Rekt) stands at $11.58 million, with $8.98 million in long positions and $2.60 million in short positions. This suggests that while longs took losses amid the weekend drop, short sellers are now at risk of a squeeze if the price stabilizes. XRP’s open interest has dropped by 6.70% to $3.14 billion, indicating that leveraged positions are unwinding. This could signal the end of the current correction, setting the stage for a fresh uptrend if demand picks up. With strong derivatives volume and long positions outweighing shorts, the market appears to be positioning for a rebound. If broader sentiment improves and regulatory fears subside, XRP could regain momentum in the coming days. 3 Key Events XRP Traders Must Watch in the Week Ahead XRP’s correction phase appears temporary, with derivatives market indicators pointing to sustained bullish momentum. Here are key factors influencing price movements this week: 1. Ripple Files Trademark for New Crypto Wallet Application According to recent media posts , Ripple has reportedly filed for a trademark under the name “RIPPLE CUSTODY,” which hints at a potential new product focused on crypto storage solutions. Ripple Files Trademark for New Cryptocurrency Wallet Application, March 16, 2025 This development could drive fresh investor interest in the week ahead.

U.S. Federal Reserve Decision on February 19 The upcoming Fed meeting will play a crucial role in shaping broader market sentiment.

Strategic investors will keenly watch out for Soundbites, and insights from key ETF sponsors in the coming weeks. XRP Price Forecast: Bulls Eye $2.80 Rebound XRP price forecast suggests a broader crypto market recovery is underway, setting the stage for XRP’s next move. The XRP/USDT daily chart presents a mix of consolidation and volatility, but key technical indicators hint at a potential rebound. The Keltner Channel (KC) midline at $2.35 is acting as immediate resistance, and a breakout above this level could open the door toward the upper KC band near $2.77. XRP Price Forecast The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 47.49 sits in neutral territory, signaling neither overbought nor oversold conditions. However, its recent bounce from 40 suggests growing bullish momentum. A sustained RSI climb above 50 would reinforce the case for continued upside. Despite the recent 8.38% dip in a single session, volume data shows a healthy recovery, with prior bullish days recording over 1.25 billion in volume—a sign that buyers remain engaged. If XRP can maintain support near $2.30, the bulls could regain control, driving prices toward $2.50 in the short term and $2.80 in extension. On the flip side, failure to hold $2.30 could invite deeper retracements, potentially testing the lower KC band near $1.92.

33767162,[object Object],1742169634,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Is The Bitcoin Cycle Peak In? Historical Halving Data Suggests Upside Potential Into Late 2025,https://bitcoinist.com/is-the-bitcoin-cycle-peak-in-historical-halving-data-suggests-upside-potential-into-late-2025/,"Bitcoin is now down over 29% from its all-time high (ATH) in January, and speculation about a coming bear market is growing among investors. After weeks of heavy selling pressure, Bitcoin has entered a consolidation phase, trading between $80K and $85K, with no clear breakout direction yet. Bulls now face a critical test, as they must push BTC above key resistance levels to prevent bears from driving prices lower. If BTC fails to reclaim $85K-$90K, it could lead to another round of selling pressure, sending the price toward lower demand zones. The uncertainty in global markets, combined with macroeconomic headwinds such as inflation concerns, rising interest rates, and trade war fears, has kept investor sentiment fragile. Despite this short-term uncertainty, insights from IntoTheBlock highlight an important historical trend—when analyzing previous Bitcoin halvings, peaks typically occur 12–18 months post-halving, which would point to mid-to-late 2025 as the likely timeframe for this cycle’s top. The big question remains: Is this cycle different? With institutional adoption rising, government policies shifting, and market volatility increasing, analysts are watching closely to determine whether Bitcoin will follow its historical pattern or if external factors will reshape this cycle. The next few months will be crucial in deciding Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory . Historical Halving Trends Suggest More Growth Ahead Bitcoin has been under heavy selling pressure, mirroring the broader struggles of both the crypto market and the US stock market. Macroeconomic uncertainty, trade war fears, and tightening financial conditions have all contributed to weakened investor sentiment, leading to widespread volatility across risk assets. Since the start of the month, Bitcoin has dropped nearly 20%, and the bearish trend appears to be holding. However, despite the short-term weakness, market fundamentals remain strong. Institutional adoption continues to grow, and US President Donald Trump’s plans to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve could serve as a major catalyst for future price movements. Insights from IntoTheBlock on X highlight that when looking at historical Bitcoin halving cycles, peaks tend to occur 12–18 months after a halving event. This pattern suggests that the current cycle’s top could emerge around mid-to-late 2025. While institutional flows and regulatory developments could introduce new variables into this cycle, IntoTheBlock analysts believe there is still time left before Bitcoin reaches its true peak. If historical trends hold, this correction may be a necessary phase before another major rally unfolds. Bitcoin Struggles Below $85K As Bulls Face Critical Resistance Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at $84,200, struggling to regain momentum after days of selling pressure that have kept the price below the $85K mark. Bulls must reclaim the $90K-$91K level to confirm a potential recovery, as this range coincides with the 4-hour 200 moving average (MA) and exponential moving average (EMA)—key technical levels that often signal trend shifts. If BTC can break through this resistance, it could trigger a strong upward move, potentially setting the stage for another push toward all-time highs. However, failure to hold above $85K and reclaim the moving averages could lead to further downside pressure, sending Bitcoin below the $80K mark. With market sentiment still fragile, bulls face a critical test in the coming days. If BTC remains trapped below resistance, selling pressure could intensify, forcing the market into lower demand zones. On the other hand, a decisive breakout above $90K could restore bullish momentum, signaling a potential end to the recent correction phase. The next trading sessions will be crucial in determining Bitcoin’s short-term trajectory.

Trader Ali Martinez tells his 132,900 followers on the social media platform X that whales gobbled up more than $815.514 million worth of ETH in less than a week. “Whales have bought more than 420,000 Ethereum ETH in [five days]!” Source: Ali Martinez/X Martinez is also keeping a close watch on Ethereum’s In/Out of the Money Around Price (IOMAP) metric – which classifies crypto addresses as either profiting, breaking even, or losing money – to determine support and resistance levels for ETH. According to Martinez, ETH is currently trading in a narrow range between stiff support and resistance zones. “Ethereum ETH key levels to watch! On-chain data reveals $1,870 as the strongest support and $2,050 as its toughest resistance!” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, ETH is trading for $1,941. Turning to Bitcoin ( BTC ), the trader believes that the crypto king is poised to witness tactical rallies after breaching the horizontal resistance of an ascending triangle pattern. “Bitcoin BTC is breaking out! The target is $90,000 as long as the $84,000 support holds.” Source: Ali Martinez/X An ascending triangle pattern may be considered a bullish reversal structure if the asset soars above its horizontal resistance. At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $84,288. Turning to Ethereum rival Cardano, the analyst predicts rallies for ADA if the altcoin takes out the diagonal resistance of a triangle pattern at around $0.75. “Cardano ADA is about to break free! Busting out of this triangle will trigger a 15% price move.” Source: Ali Martinez/X A triangle is typically viewed as a consolidation pattern as it signals a potential breakout in either direction. The asset is considered bullish if the price moves above the diagonal resistance and bearish if it tumbles below the diagonal trend line. At time of writing, ADA is worth $0.744.

Participants in Pi Network gained 1000% through early investments since the network had not obtained broad market acceptance at that time. During its early price increase many people overlooked the gemstone and consequently started to doubt whether they would encounter another similar lucrative opportunity. The project Remittixgenerated a presale success rate worth $13.9 million through selling 520 million+ tokens at $0.0734 each. Lessons from Pi Network’s Rapid Rise PI Chart since its inception on February 20, 2025. Source: tradingview Pi Network became known to the public due to its remarkable 1000% growth. The sudden price spike surprised seasoned traders about how quickly altcoins move from small community use to widespread global adoption. Manifesting dramatic value growth serves as evidence for spotting worthwhile cryptocurrency projects when they start at a low level since market performance often leads to unnatural cost elevation. The ability to mine Pi grew popular among crypto users because of its user-friendly mobile platform along with its easy-accessible mining process which allowed more people to participate. The inclusive philosophy of the platform eventually transformed into widespread curiosity which resulted in exceptional price growth. People who did not catch the initial opportunity study alternative coins that demonstrate real market potential for explosive growth. Introducing Remittix: A Real-World Payment Focus The core focus of Remittix lies in delivering instant crypto-to-fiat solutions compared to how Pi depended on community-building and accessibility features. The team seeks to make the process easy for regular people and companies exchanging digital tokens with traditional currencies since it represents a major barrier toward blockchain adoption. The Remittix token features both business utility and simple design elements which help it exceed the role of exchange tokens.The Remittix presale reached recognition when it accepted $13.9 million through the sale of 520 million tokens. Investors recognize the market potential of creating a simple solution between regular currency and cryptocurrency exchanges since new adopters face challenges with difficult steps and variable costs and delayed transactions. Remittix could equal or exceed Pi's value growth by maintaining strategic partnership deals between merchants, remittance services as well as e-commerce platforms. Roadmap Highlights and Potential Catalysts The foundation of Remittix relies heavily on the natural buzz generated by its community members just like Pi Network. As well as building community buzz the initiative develops a regulatory-conscious framework to draw institutional support. Support from bigger organizations would grow through establishing clear legal guidelines with robust oversight mechanisms. The token price can jump rapidly if Remittix completes essential alliances which include facilitating immediate crypto payouts across gig-economy platforms. The future growth of the altcoin directly depends on how it implements its planned expansions. Many projects incur failure after making their expansion too rapid. Remittix will succeed by moving at a controlled speed and providing stable exchanges between crypto assets and demonstrating genuine use examples. The implementation of hyped-driven growth initiatives that extend beyond reasonable capacity boundaries leads to price drops. The token works to protect its clear mission through its focus on rapid settlements to build strong adoption of its users. Conclusion: A Potential Successor to Pi Network’s Leap A profitable launch takes place when token platforms create useful platforms which community support networks accept. The market has received a new promising technology called Remittix which enables digital currency use through standard shopping activities. The continuing success of the presale demonstrates widespread faith in the project from many people. The practical solutions that Remittix delivers create conditions for widespread mainstream adoption of its product even with rapidly changing markets. People who did not secure Pi's 1000% surge now have an opportunity to participate in Remittixgrowth as the project sets course for widespread adoption. Current success in presale indicates the potential for Remittix to become the anticipated breakthrough in cryptocurrency based on its roadmap's expected success and widespread payment demand.

He highlighted five cryptocurrencies: XRP (Ripple), Solana, Cardano (ADA), Bitcoin, and Ethereum. The crypto market, which often reacts strongly to the news, saw a 62% increase in the value of XRP, Solana, and ADA and a 10% rise in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Investing in these coins could be wise, as the administration plans to implement policies and regulations to support their growth. Let's look at them individually and why you should collect them after Trump’s mention. Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin is the first crypto coin released after the Satoshi paper. Despite breaking an all-time price high shortly after Trump’s election victory, it is expected to still rise in value thanks to Trump’s long-term crypto plans. Currently, the United States holds a large amount of BTC and is expected to buy more for its proposed reserve. Bitcoin is often regarded as digital gold because of its scarcity and potential for long-term growth. As a result, it is one of the most highly traded assets in crypto trading . It is also the most liquid coin, which makes it easy to buy and sell. Due to its wide adoption as a mode of payment, it is a great option for you. Bitcoin currently hovers around $86,636.54 as of the time of writing. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum is another cryptocurrency you should consider. It is known for its decentralisation and is second only to Bitcoin regarding market cap. ETH has many use cases, including earning on investments by staking , playing games, and interacting on social media. Its smart-contract characteristics help eliminate the need for intermediaries, a form of security for the coin. With a market capitalisation of about $261.95B and a price range of $2,172.12 per Ethereum, it is expected to attract major investors in light of Trump’s recent speech. The total supply of Ethereum is about 120 million and runs on about 15.8 transactions per second. Thanks to a proof-of-stake mechanism , it is energy efficient and perfect for building Dapps like NFTs and DeFi tokens. These features make ETH a credible addition to your portfolio at the moment. Ripple (XRP) Ripple’s XRP has been on several investors’ radars since former Securities and Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler stepped down. Buying XRP is a smart move due to the tokens' unique properties. It is one of the cryptocurrencies known for its international payment, and it is not mined like other coins; instead, it is obtained through a process known as a unique consensus mechanism. XRP's market capitalisation is about $145 billion, with a price of about $2.50 and a circulating supply of 57 billion. It has very fast translation speeds, and it is used mainly by big financial institutions for payments. Due to its low transaction cost, you could also use XRP for cross-border payments. Solana (SOL) Solana has many profitable prospects, as it has grown by over 11% in recent weeks. It has become a point of interest for savvy crypto investors after being mentioned by the president, and rightly so. It has a total supply of about 595 million Solana with a price tag of about $145.68. Its market capitalisation is about $73 billion, with about 65,000 transactions per second, which makes it very fast and highly scalable. You could also use Solana for the building of NFTs, just like ADA and ETH, and you also don’t have to worry about transaction fees as they are low. Are you thinking of a cryptocurrency that has short and long-term profit prospects? Solana is a good option. Cardano (ADA) Cardano’s ADA has powerful scaling properties, which is one reason you should consider collecting ADA. It was created using Proof of Stake ouroboros, which minimises energy consumption. This coin was launched in September 2017 and has about 35 billion ADA in circulation, with a current price of $0.87. Despite its current valuation per token, which stands at less than a dollar, it has a high propensity for growth in the long run. It has a market capitalisation of about $12.67 billion and plans to achieve about 1 million transactions per second. ADA allows easy interaction with other blockchains and uses smart contracts, which can be used to explore Dapps like NFTs. Criteria To Consider Before Collecting a Coin These five coins mentioned by the president of the US are viable crypto additions to your portfolio. Still, before acquiring them, you must ensure that the coins you acquire are perfect for your needs. Here are tips to help you make the right crypto investment choice: ● Adoption: Analyze how many people adopt the coin and what institution recognises it. A wide adoption can be social proof. ● Market trends: Check for the market trends of the coin you plan to invest in, as it will guide you on how the coin has been performing. Opting for a coin in the top market trend might be a good decision.● Price performance: Knowing the coin's previous and current price can also give you insight into its performance. Even though the price action might not reflect the coin's actual value, it can provide insight into its performance.● Utility: Knowing the coin's utility can help you discern the coin’s actual value. This can be obtained from its use cases. For example, if the coin’s ‘use cases’ improve, the coin will improve. You should also check the regulations governing each coin, as there can be different regulations pertaining to each. Why Now Might Be the Right Time To Invest in These Coins The market growth of the five coins shortly after the speech reflects that investment decisions are already moving towards the coins, and this could be the best time for you to invest in them. However, before you acquire anyone, ensure they have the utility, price performance and adoption that suit your purpose and satisfy your performance criteria.

Alphractal points to the Global Economic Policy Uncertainty Index and the Economic Policy Uncertainty Index for the United States, both of which are nearing their highest levels on record. Historically, such increases in uncertainty have been associated with higher market volatility and, in some cases, economic recessions. The Global Economic Policy Uncertainty Index is a measure of economic policy uncertainty across 20 major economies, taking into account media reports, forecast discrepancies, and tax law changes. A higher index value indicates greater uncertainty that could affect investment decisions, currency fluctuations, and broader financial markets. Related News: Watch Out: 23 Altcoins Have Massive Token Unlocks in the New Week - Here's the Day-by-Day, Hour-by-Hour List Similarly, the U.S. Economic Policy Uncertainty Index assesses uncertainty in the U.S. by analyzing media coverage, tax policy expirations, and changes in economic forecasts. Increases in this index have often preceded periods of economic turmoil and instability. Alphractal warns that increased economic uncertainty could increase volatility across multiple asset classes, including stocks, bonds, and cryptocurrencies. Historical trends suggest that increases in uncertainty often lead to significant market volatility, as seen in past economic crises when both the S&P 500 and Bitcoin (BTC) exhibited significant price swings. According to the analytics company, for cryptocurrency investors, these developments may indicate a period in which price movements will increase and market trends will be unpredictable. *This is not investment advice.

41780857,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=694125,1742171322,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/41780857.jpeg,Solana ($SOL) celebrates 5 years since its official launch,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/solana-sol-celebrates-5-years-since-launch/,"Blockchain platform Solana commemorates its fifth year in the crypto industry since launching in 2020. So far, the network has processed close to $410 billion worth of transactions with a little over 1300 validators. Not to mention, the ecosystem also boasts impressive DEX trading volumes, almost surpassing $1 trillion . Solana’s Gokal encourages the crypto community to launch their own tokens In an X post on March 16, Solana acknowledged its developers and founders who worked hard to build the network and even suggested that the platform has more projects lined up for the crypto community. Co-founder Raj Gokal also commented, leaning towards encouraging developers to introduce their own tokens. He stated, “If we could launch then, you can launch now.” Gokal recalled what was happening on planet Earth at this time five years ago, when everyone around the world was on lockdown and projects, especially crypto, were being cancelled one by one. Anatoly Yakovenko, Solana’s co-founder, also joined in the celebration, wishing all the platform’s enthusiasts worldwide a happy Solana 0 block day. Yakovenko also said that everything was going according to plan, and looking at the characteristics of SOL as a blockchain, few people would argue with this. Solana’s ecosystem still has over $8.5 billion in total value locked in DeFi protocols, having handled more than $408 billion in transactions. Moreover, the network’s fees and revenues are more than double that of Ethereum, and the SOL token has just over $65.5 billion in market cap. SOL could surge past the $300 mark in September 2025 Solana’s price has been under pressure, plunging from $180 in February to current levels below $140. The token’s price slid slightly by 5.67% in the last 24 hours, trading at only $126.83 . The futures market provides a similar snapshot. Funding rates on SOL perpetual futures have been negative for three days, and short sellers are currently paying to hold their positions — an indication of little demand for leveraged long positions. Perhaps more worrying, accumulation has stalled. The total number of Solana wallets holding at least 10,000 SOL fell from 5,053 to 5,023, a signal some large investors may be cashing out or reducing exposure. Analysts believe that SOL has enough room to recover despite steps taken down in the last few days. They even forecast a 10% surge over the next month and a new record by the end of the year. Experts also expect the token’s price to range between $127.50 and $150.14 and have an ROI of 12.76% in the three-month period ending June. They even estimate the token’s average price of $135.99. Some even project that the asset will be trading far above $300 by September 2025. On the other hand, some have estimated prices to oscillate at somewhere between $235.73 and $311.32, with an ROI of at least 133%. Firedancer upgrade set to boost Solana’s speed and stability The next major milestone for Solana’s blockchain is expected to be the launch of Jump Crypto’s Firedancer client—an alternative high-performance validator designed to enhance the network’s transaction throughput and resilience against threats and outages. A testnet version and a prototype mainnet iteration called Frankendancer were introduced in September 2023. Though its launch was originally planned for the second quarter of 2024, Firedancer is widely expected to launch in full this year. Helius co-founder Mert Memtaz, a significant figure in the Solana community, predicted in December that Firedancer will go live “end of Q2.” The upgrade is expected to help Solana scale towards its goal of 1 million transactions per second (TPS). Meanwhile, Solana could also be approved for inclusion in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in 2024. According to The Block’s ETF tracking data, several asset managers have filed for Solana-based ETFs. Analysts have identified Solana—alongside Litecoin, Dogecoin, and XRP—as a strong contender for ETF approval. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

UK Royal Court of Appeal Judge Christopher Nugee knocked back Howells’ application, stating that there was no “real prospect of success” and there was “no other compelling reason” as to why it should be heard, according to a March 13 filing shared with Cointelegraph. Source: James Howells Nugee’s decision follows an earlier dismissal on Jan. 9 from High Court Judge Andrew Keyser, who similarly said there was “no realistic prospect” of Howells’ case succeeding at a full trial. In a note to Cointelegraph, Howell said his “last legal option” to exhaust is at the ECHR — where he will claim that the UK High Court and UK Court of Appeal breached his right to property and right to a fair trial under Article 1 of Protocol 1 and Article 6 of the ECHR. “The British establishment want to sweep this under the carpet, and i will not let them. It will not go away — no matter how long it takes!” The ECHR cannot overrule a UK court decision — however, a verdict in Howells’ favor would call on the UK courts to consider whether its legislation was interpreted in a way that is compatible with the ECHR’s provisions. In a separate statement shared with Cointelegraph, Howells said he would file a claim to the ECHR in the “coming weeks.” The court filings follow repeated rejections from the Newport City Council allowing Howells to search through the Docksway landfill — where Howells’ former partner disposed of a bag containing the hard drive at the site in 2013.

Individuals who ignored it at the right moment regretted missing out on massive profits later on. Remittix (RTX), at present, is on the same journey and offering a revolutionary payment solution on blockchain. RTX offers an actual use-case unlike speculative tokens and ranks as one of the most promising options in the industry right now. As Remittix snowballs along, many think RTX might be the next big star in the digital finance universe. Will traders miss out on another project with enormous adoption prospects yet again, or will RTX eclipse the success of Pi Coin? Pi Coin’s Journey: A Lesson in Missed Opportunities The current Pi Coin (PI) price is $1.45, a drop of 0.83%. Despite the drop in value, Pi Coin has attained a market cap of $10.06 billion, an indicator that risk-taking early investors are being rewarded. Source: Tradingview It nevertheless had a skeptical reception at launch and most people dismissed it as another experiment. It grew its network in due course of time and those who invested early reaped an immense profit from it. Unfortunately, most people didn't appreciate its rise to success and only noticed its value when it was too late. Now that Remittix (RTX) begins to ascend, investors are observing closely, determined not to make the same mistake. Why Remittix (RTX) Could Be the Next Big Crypto Remittix (RTX) is in the news as a blockchain-based financial platform that provides fee-free and real-time cryptocurrency-fiat transactions. RTX currently trades at $0.0734 and raised $13.9 million and sold 520 million tokens, reflecting strong investor interest. Compared to Pi Coin, which built its network through mobile mining, RTX is being built with use in the real world in mind. A US-based freelancer who does work for clients in Europe, for instance, can use RTX to receive payment instantly, avoiding banking commissions and settlement times. RTX is consequently a practical financial tool rather than a speculative vehicle. PayFi model of RTX provides a new standard in cryptocurrency payments and finds itself as one of the most promising blockchain payment prospects out there. Can Remittix (RTX) Outperform Pi Coin? The popularity of Pi Coin demonstrates blockchain innovations' potential for mass adoption, but Remittix (RTX) has something even better—actual use cases in the real world. While Pi Coin's development falls behind, RTX is seeing real-world adoption and is thus a high-growth investment opportunity. Unlike speculative meme coins or projects with questionable use cases, RTX is solving a global financial problem. Businesses, freelancers, and merchants are turning to RTX for seamless digital payments, and that's what's fueling its growing adoption. As the use of cryptocurrency keeps on increasing, the chances of RTX surpassing Pi Coin in market cap and growth in value improve by the day. With increasing use of cryptocurrency, RTX could be one of the largest winners in 2025. Why Now Is the Best Time to Invest in RTX Investors who missed Pi Coin’s early rise are now looking at Remittix (RTX) as a second chance. With its crypto-to-fiat payment system, RTX is attracting serious attention from investors and businesses alike. Unlike other speculative assets, RTX offers real-world financial applications, making it one of the most promising blockchain investments today. As more companies integrate crypto payments, RTX’s value is expected to rise significantly. For those looking for the next big opportunity, RTX presents a rare chance to get in early before mainstream adoption takes off. Invest in the Future of Blockchain Payments with Remittix (RTX) With Remittix gaining momentum, many investors are turning to RTX as the next major force in blockchain finance. Its focus on instant, low-cost transactions makes it a strong alternative to traditional banking systems. Pi Coin taught investors that early adoption in promising blockchain projects can lead to massive gains. Now, RTX is proving to be the next major opportunity in crypto payments. As blockchain adoption accelerates, RTX is positioning itself as a leader in financial technology, making it one of the most exciting crypto investments of the decade.

With institutional interest growing and regulatory clarity improving, XRP’s bullish momentum is building fast. But it’s not the only token poised for exponential gains Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a high-potential DeFi contender, attracting early investors with its innovative tokenomics and staggering growth projections. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), is gaining momentum and may hit that benchmark first. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) shows strong performance growth in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector through its dual-lending model innovation. The third phase of Mutuum Finance presale continues while this high-growth altcoin sells for $0.02 and has collected $3.2 million. The next stage of the presale will boost MUTM’s price to $0.025 while attracting more than 5500 investors while simultaneously raising funds to $0.03 million. The initial investors during this phase will receive a 200% payback when the launch price reaches $0.06 while future forecast estimates predict a value surge past $5 in the near future. A DeFi Giant on the Rise Mutuum Finance pushes forward decentralized lending through dual lending while promoting mass adoption because of its transformative structure. More than 5,700 investors joined the presale funding to support the project which received $3.4 million in total. Mutuum Finance’s price currently reaches $0.02 in Phase 3 even though investors anticipate a 25% price increase in Phase 4 which will generate considerable profit potential. The analysts forecast MUTM to surge beyond $5 in upcoming months when it launches at $0.06 because its distinctive lending approach meets rising market requirements thus making it an underappreciated yet promising DeFi resource. The Dual-Model System for Enhanced DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance transforms DeFi lending through the combination of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending systems. Through the P2C model users can achieve passive income by lending their USDT through liquidity pools that operate automatically through smart contracts. The P2P model provides transactions which operate without intermediaries allowing users to personally manage their assets through direct deals. Mutuum Finance unites P2C and P2P lending methods to secure and streamline its decentralized operation thus creating profitable opportunities for investors looking to maximize yield in DeFi.

In several examples posted to X, the email claims to be from Coinbase, asking users to transition to self-custodial wallets and providing instructions on downloading the legitimate Coinbase Wallet, giving a deadline of April 1 to make the switch. Source: Steve Kaczynski However, it also provides pre-generated recovery phrases . Once users open a new wallet with those phrases and transfer funds, all the assets will be available to the threat actor, who could drain the wallet. The email mentions a class-action lawsuit against Coinbase alleging it has sold unregistered securities, which has resulted in a court mandating users manage their own wallets. “Coinbase will operate as a registered broker, allowing purchases, but all assets must move to Coinbase Wallet,” the phony email says. The US Securities and Exchange Commission dismissed its lawsuit alleging Coinbase was an unregistered broker and selling unregistered securities on Feb. 27. Coinbase told Cointelegraph it is aware of the scam and pointed to its March 14 post to X, saying , “We will never send you a recovery phrase, and you should never enter a recovery phrase given to you by someone else.” Source: Coinbase Support Crypto exchange Gemini has also been spoofed with the same recovery phrase email scam, using the same tactics and claiming users need to set up a new wallet because of a recent court decision. Gemini was being sued by the SEC for allegedly offering unregistered securities through its earn program. The regulator opted to end the legal action on Feb. 26.

Arizona federal court Judge Douglas Rayes on March 13 granted the CFTC’s earlier motion for summary judgment in its case and ordered Debiex to pay back around $2.26 million it stole from its customers, along with a civil penalty of nearly $221,500. Judge Rayes said there was no evidence that Debiex’s failure to respond to the CFTC was the result of “excusable neglect.” The CFTC sued Debiex in January 2024, saying its staff ran a so-called “pig butchering” scam , where they initiated romantic relationships with customers over social media to gain trust to convince them to invest in the platform. The scheme hooked five victims who deposited around $2.3 million in total onto Debiex, which the purported trading platform stole, the CFTC said. A highlighted excerpt of Judge Rayes’ order summarizing the CFTC’s case against Debiex, Source: CourtListener The CFTC also accused Zhāng Chéng Yáng of being a “money mule” for Debiex, whose crypto wallets were used to accept and steal victims’ funds. Judge Rayes granted a CFTC motion for default judgment against Zhāng on March 12, finding it adequately alleged he controls a crypto wallet with OKX “that received digital assets to which he had no legitimate claim.” He said OKX was “voluntarily preserving” the crypto in Zhāng’s account and ordered its contents, consisting of $5.70 worth of Tether ( USDT ) and nearly 63 Ether ( ETH ) worth around $119,500, to be transferred to an unnamed victim. The CFTC said in its January 2024 complaint that Debiex’s scheme saw its unknown managers target potential victims through social media to lure them to websites it had created marketing itself as a “Blockchain Network Decentralized perpetual contract trading platform” where users can conduct futures trading and “Mining transactions.” Related: Four suspects charged in home invasion of streamer Amouranth Debiex’s staff would present as females and built a rapport with victims through “continuous and repeated messaging and sharing purported pictures of themselves” while claiming to be “highly successful digital asset commodities traders,” the CFTC said. Once an account was created and the customers sent over their crypto, the CFTC said Debiex would share “fictitious information” about customer balances, trading positions and profits. “All of this information was most likely false,” the CFTC said. “The evidence shows that the Customers’ digital assets were simply sent to numerous digital asset wallets in an attempt to obfuscate their destination.” Magazine: SEC’s U-turn on crypto leaves key questions unanswered",,EN,0,0,TRADING|USDT|BLOCKCHAIN|COMMODITY|ETH,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-03-17 02:11:07

Qubetics’ Presale Boom Puts It Ahead While AAVE and Ethereum Keep Dominating 2025,https://timestabloid.com/best-coins-to-buy-today-qubetics-presale-boom-puts-it-ahead/,"If you’re looking to invest in the best coins to buy today , Qubetics, AAVE, and Ethereum should definitely be on your radar. As the cryptocurrency market continues to heat up, these three coins are catching the eye of both casual crypto enthusiasts and seasoned professionals. Each of these projects brings something innovative to the table, with the potential to shape the future of blockchain, decentralized finance, and digital transactions. Qubetics, a rising star in the crypto world, has already made waves with its decentralized VPN and interoperability solutions, making it one of the most exciting tokens to watch in 2025. Ethereum continues to dominate the blockchain space with its Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, which promises to solve scalability issues while maintaining its position as the go-to platform for decentralized applications (dApps). Meanwhile, AAVE is still a powerhouse in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, revolutionizing how users borrow and lend digital assets. Qubetics: The Interoperable Blockchain Solution You Didn’t Know You Needed When it comes to the best coins to buy today, Qubetics is undeniably a standout. The project isn’t simply riding the wave of blockchain hype; it’s making a significant impact with its innovative solutions, particularly in interoperability and decentralized privacy. Let’s explore why Qubetics deserves your attention. Solving Blockchain’s Interoperability Challenge What is Interoperability? Interoperability refers to the ability of different blockchain networks to communicate and work together seamlessly. In today’s blockchain world, without this capability, users are left within isolated ecosystems that have limited functionality and cause friction between platforms. Qubetics’ Cross-Chain Protocol: Qubetics is addressing this major issue by offering a cross-chain interoperability protocol. This protocol enables different blockchains, whether Ethereum-based or others, to work together effortlessly. Why It Matters: This makes it easier for businesses, professionals, and individuals to operate across multiple blockchain systems without the usual barriers. Whether it’s integrating decentralized apps (dApps) or leveraging blockchain solutions for various use cases, Qubetics is paving the way for greater efficiency in the ecosystem. Decentralized VPN (dVPN): The Future of Online Privacy One of Qubetics’ most exciting features is its decentralized VPN (dVPN). In a world where data privacy and security are top concerns, Qubetics offers a solution that eliminates the need to trust centralized VPN providers. Unlike traditional VPNs that rely on centralized servers, Qubetics’ decentralized VPN means there’s no single point of failure, offering a much higher level of security and privacy. For businesses, this service ensures that sensitive data remains protected, while individuals can enjoy a safe online experience, free from surveillance or hacking threats. Qubetics’ Strong Growth and Community Support Ongoing crypto Presale Success: As of now, Qubetics is in its 26th presale stage, having raised over $15 million from more than 23,000 holders. The presale has sold over 499 million tokens, demonstrating strong community support and investor interest. Attractive Investment Opportunity: With the presale price of $0.1181 per $TICS token, Qubetics offers an exciting entry point for those looking to invest before the project’s mainnet launch. AAVE: Decentralized Finance for the People Another project that has consistently been a top choice for anyone looking to buy the best coins today is AAVE. When you think of decentralized finance (DeFi), AAVE should be at the top of your list. AAVE is one of the most well-known protocols in the DeFi space, offering decentralized lending and borrowing services. It allows users to lend their assets to earn interest or borrow assets with no middleman involved, all while utilizing smart contracts to ensure security and transparency. AAVE is unique because of its flash loans—unsecured loans that must be paid back within the same transaction block. This innovative feature enables users to access liquidity without needing collateral, making it a game-changer for traders and developers looking to access capital quickly. These flash loans have helped AAVE build a strong reputation as a protocol that caters to both seasoned crypto enthusiasts and newcomers alike. Ethereum: The Backbone of Decentralized Applications and Smart Contracts It’s impossible to talk about the best coins to buy today without mentioning Ethereum. Ethereum has been the cornerstone of the blockchain ecosystem for years, and its role is only becoming more critical with the ongoing Ethereum 2.0 upgrade. Ethereum 2.0 aims to solve some of the major issues faced by Ethereum’s original version, including scalability, energy efficiency, and transaction costs. The transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) will reduce energy consumption by over 99%, addressing one of the biggest concerns surrounding Ethereum’s environmental impact. One of Ethereum’s most powerful features is its ability to support smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). This has made Ethereum the go-to platform for developers looking to build decentralized solutions in areas like DeFi, gaming, and NFTs. The Ethereum ecosystem is massive, and its dominance in the blockchain space is unlikely to fade any time soon. Conclusion: Why Qubetics, AAVE, and Ethereum Are the Best Coins to Buy Today When considering the best coins to buy today, it’s clear that Qubetics , AAVE, and Ethereum are leading the charge. Whether you’re looking for innovative interoperability solutions, a DeFi protocol that makes borrowing and lending easier, or a blockchain that powers decentralized applications, these three coins have it all. Qubetics offers an exciting opportunity with its cross-chain interoperability and decentralized VPN, while AAVE continues to redefine decentralized finance with its cutting-edge features. Ethereum remains the backbone of the blockchain industry and is poised for even greater success with Ethereum 2.0. These projects are not just about the present—they are about shaping the future of blockchain. If you’re looking to get ahead in 2025, these are the best coins to buy today. Don’t miss out on the chance to be a part of the next big wave in crypto!

Some investors capitalize early, while others look back with regret, wishing they had seized the moment. One of the most infamous “missed ICO” stories in crypto history is that of Binance Coin (BNB). Back in its early days, many overlooked its potential, only to watch it surge in value beyond their wildest expectations. But for those who feel they missed out, a new chance is on the horizon— Arctic Pablo Coin is making waves in its presale, and the opportunity it presents is strikingly similar to Binance Coin’s early days. The Numbers Speak: Arctic Pablo Coin’s Explosive ROI Potential Just like early Binance Coin investors, those who jump into Arctic Pablo Coin at this stage have a massive upside ahead. The projected launch price of Arctic Pablo Coin is set at $0.008, meaning early investors could experience an ROI of over 10,694.59%.To put it into perspective: a $500 investment now secures 6,756,520 APC tokens. When Arctic Pablo Coin lists at its launch price, that same investment will be worth a staggering $54,052.16. Those who hesitated during Binance Coin’s ICO watched others become millionaires while they stood on the sidelines. Arctic Pablo Coin offers a chance to rewrite that story. With its booming presale, strong community incentives, and exceptional growth potential, this could be the defining investment of 2025. In short, Arctic Pablo Coin is the top crypto coin to invest in 2025. Binance Coin’s Early Days: The Opportunity That Got Away When Binance Coin launched in July 2017, it was just another exchange token. The initial coin offering (ICO) priced BNB at a mere $0.15 per token. At that time, the market was flooded with new coins, and many investors were skeptical. Some saw Binance Coin as nothing more than an exchange utility token with limited potential. Others simply hesitated, unsure whether it was worth the risk. Fast forward to today, and those early doubts have turned into deep regret. Binance Coin has skyrocketed, reaching an all-time high of over $690. The investors who had the foresight to buy BNB during its ICO have seen astronomical returns. A mere $500 investment in Binance Coin during the ICO would now be worth millions. Hindsight is a cruel teacher. Those who ignored BNB’s early promise have spent years watching its meteoric rise, kicking themselves for not taking the plunge. But in the crypto world, second chances are rare—and Arctic Pablo Coin is shaping up to be the next golden opportunity for those looking to turn back time.

Arctic Pablo Coin shines as the top crypto coin with its innovative approach, rewarding community engagement, and an impressive presale performance. Currently, Arctic Pablo Coin is in the Frosty Falls phase (14th stage) of its presale, with tokens priced at $0.000074 each. Over $1.88 million has already been raised, proving that investors are recognizing its potential. But what truly sets Arctic Pablo Coin apart is its robust referral incentives—a system that allows investors to spread the word and earn rewards, ensuring organic and community-driven growth.

Reports suggest that President Donald Trump’s team is eyeing XRP as a key player in building a powerhouse Bitcoin (BTC) reserve. A new proposal submitted to the US SEC suggests that XRP could play a key role in boosting the US financial system. The plan claims that integrating XRP could unlock $1.5 trillion in liquidity, which could then be used to buy Bitcoin. However, this idea faces major regulatory hurdles, and it remains unclear if the government will take it seriously. How XRP Could Free Up Trapped Funds The five page proposal written by Maximilian Staudinger suggests that the US should consider using XRP to free up capital stuck in Nostro accounts. These accounts, used for cross-border transactions, hold about $27 trillion globally, with around $5 trillion belonging to US banks. By using XRP, Staudinger believes that $1.5 trillion could be released and redirected toward Bitcoin purchases. Staudinger also proposes a structured crypto reserve system for the US. He argues that Bitcoin should be at the center, while Solana and Cardano could be used for government applications. However, he insists that XRP is the most important asset for handling financial transactions. Bold Bitcoin Claims Raise Questions One of the more questionable parts of the proposal is the claim that the US could buy 25 million Bitcoin at $60,000 per coin. This is impossible since Bitcoin’s total supply is only 21 million. Still, the proposal argues that using XRP could save the US up to $7.5 billion in transaction fees annually and make government payments, like Social Security and tax refunds, faster and cheaper. Regulatory Challenges Stand in the Way Despite its ambitious plan, the proposal faces a big setback—XRP’s unclear regulatory status. Staudinger urges the SEC to classify XRP as a payment asset instead of a security. He also calls on the Department of Justice to lift restrictions preventing banks from using XRP. To speed things up, he suggests a presidential executive order to bypass regulatory delays. His plan includes two timelines: a standard 24-month rollout with standard regulatory approval, government payments, and bank adoption, or opting for a fast-track 6-12 month timeline using executive orders and Fed mandates for quick XRP integration. While ambitious, the fast-track approach could work given Ripple’s existing global liquidity network. Will This Proposal Go Anywhere? While the idea sounds interesting, independent proposals like this usually don’t gain much traction unless backed by major financial institutions or government officials. Without strong support, this remains a bold idea rather than a plan the US is likely to adopt anytime soon.",News|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,XRP|BTC|REGULATION|FIAT|ADA,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-17 03:04:36

According CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost’s latest market analysis post on X, on Jan. 17, Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) open interest hit a record $33 billion, signaling extreme leverage in the market. However, political uncertainty tied to former U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent actions led to a wave of liquidations. https://twitter.com/darkfost_coc/status/1901368698868473975?s=46&t=nznXkss3debX8JIhNzHmzw Subsequently, nearly $10 billion in open interest vanished between Feb. 20 and Mar. 4. This sharp decline pushed Bitcoin’s 90-day futures open interest change down to -14%, often signaling market resets before price recoveries. Analysts believe that eliminating excessive speculation, these stages provide a more stable basis for future growth. You might also like: “What we’re seeing now is looking just like March 2017”. Analysts explain why Bitcoin could soon recover — or crash harder Bitcoin’s long-term outlook is still optimistic despite the decline. According to economist Timothy Peterson, April and October are usually when Bitcoin experiences the biggest seasonal gains. Peterson’s most recent analysis reveals that Bitcoin might hit new all-time highs before June, with a median target of $126,000. Bitcoin is trading near the low end of its historical seasonal range. Nearly all of Bitcoin's annual performance occurs in 2 months: April and October. It is entirely possible Bitcoin could reach a new all-time high before June. pic.twitter.com/p8upTNAkKH — Timothy Peterson (@nsquaredvalue) March 15, 2025 In addition, his “Lowest Price Forward” model, which estimates a price level that Bitcoin is unlikely to drop below in future trading, indicates that Bitcoin’s price floor has now risen to $69,000, with a 95% chance of holding. Past bull markets have shown that corrections like Bitcoin’s recent 30% pullback often precede strong rebounds. However, not all analysts are fully bullish. Benjamin Cowen, founder of Into The Cryptoverse, warned on a Mar. 15 YouTube stream that Bitcoin’s bull cycle could be in jeopardy if it drops below the 2024 highs, which is in the lower $70,000s. Cowen compares the current cycle to 2017 when Bitcoin retested the prior year’s high. He suggests the bull market might be over if Bitcoin closes in the low $60,000s. Additionally, according to Cowen, holding above $70,000–$73,000 would maintain the market’s structure. Bitcoin may signal a macro lower high later in the year if it drops below this level, which could result in a more bearish outlook by Q3. Bitcoin is still in a crucial consolidation phase , with its current price at $82,900 at the time of press. If past trends hold, this reset could pave the way for another strong rally in the coming months.

Regional news outlets have been busy reporting in recent months on the manifold troubles facing the event, set to be a cashless endeavor and featuring its own so-called “Web3” wallet. A big part of the cashless and the “Web3” promotion of Expo 2025 has been the official wallet app of the event. Wallet users who log-in every month will receive an SBT (“Soulbound Token”) — as well as another non-fungible token (NFT) commemorating the 1970 Osaka World Expo. Expo 2025’s repulsive mascot dressed as Santa Claus drew disapproval from Japanese users of social media platform X. The site notes: “Even before the Expo officially begins, you can join the Expo-related services and events through the ‘Connect Feature’, which is linked to Web3 Wallets and the SBT Digital Passport.” Attendees are also made aware they can pay by mere facial recognition, should they register their biometric data with the wallet. Aside from heavy promotion of cashless payments (indeed, there will be no cash options inside the expo), the expo’s digital wallet, which does not feature the ability to pay with any actually decentralized or private peer-to-peer cryptocurrency, is being leveraged to sell the United Nations’ controversial Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) initiative (one intiative of which is actual insect-food vending machines placed in Japan , to help fight overpopulation and climate change, so-called.). “Earn unique points by participating in various SDGs and the EXPO initiatives, and by exchanging other points!” the wallet’s website states. Cryptopolitan reached out to event organizers regarding event difficulties and the Expo 2025 Digital Wallet, but at time of writing, no response has been received. Cashless Expo 2025’s mascot Myaku-Myaku grosses-out public “No matter how you dress it up, I just can’t stand it.” “Disgusting.” “I’m sorry, but it just looks like a monster to me.” These are just a few of the reactions to the expo’s mascot, “Myaku-Myaku,” on an X post from last November. Japanese X users speculate on Expo 2025 as a potential center for disease. The Japanese portion reads in part (translated): “Do not go near people who went to the Osaka Expo. People who went to the Osaka Expo are infected with a new virus.” Expo 2025’s official website describes the character as “a mysterious creature born from the fusion of cells and water,” elaborating: “The red part represents ‘cells,’ which divide and multiply … [and] the blue part represents ‘pure water,’ which can flow and change shape.” If you think a description of the onomatapoeic Japanese “myaku-myaku” might ease your mind about the character somehow relating to genetic mutation, you might be wrong. The official site clarifies: “Our human DNA, wisdom, technology, history and culture have been passed down “myaku-myaku” (continuously) from generation to generation.” The term, notably, can also mean “pulsating.” Some Japanese are even speculating , controversially, that the Expo’s self-decribed “People’s Living Lab” may be just that: a center of some kind of new disease. Public upset with the expo’s confusing ticketing system and construction Kyodo News reported on March 13 that the projected three-trillion-yen impact (about $20 billion USD) of the expo may fail to be realized due to poor ticket sales and delays in construction. Though the original target was to sell 14 million tickets, as of March 5, the number of tickets sold reportedly stood at a mere 8 million. Hiroyuki Ishige, a leader of the Japan Association for the 2025 World Exposition, acknowledged that the goal was “extremely ambitious.” The ‘Grand Ring’ where Expo 2025 will be held in Osaka, Japan. Source: OBAYASHI CORPORATION/Expo 2025. The late introduction of new ticket types, and reduced prices for season passes added just last month, have some would-be attendees giving up altogether on going, and others demanding refunds . Further complicating preparations are major delays in construction, with the Kyodo report noting only about 20% of “Type A self-built pavilions,” considered to be the main attraction, have been completed. There have also been problems reported with foreign participants not completing interior displays by the suggested March 13 date. For now, Japanese are left to wonder if is there real trouble afoot at the artificial “ Yumeshima ” (roughly translated “Dream Island/Continent”) location.

In a response to a written inquiry from Rep. Cha Gyu-geun of the Democratic Party of Korea on March 16, the BOK opened up about the need for caution when considering Bitcoin as part of the country’s financial assets. This marks the first time the BOK has officially addressed the issue. According to Korea Economic TV, the central bank cited Bitcoin’s extreme price volatility as a major concern. The price of Bitcoin has seen sharp fluctuations recently, soaring to 160 million won in January, before falling to 110 million won. Despite predictions of potential future growth, some experts warn that Bitcoin’s value could drop to zero at any time. The BOK explained that such instability could lead to increased transaction costs when converting Bitcoin into cash, particularly during periods of market turmoil. Additionally, the bank pointed out that Bitcoin does not meet the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) standards for foreign exchange reserves. According to the IMF, foreign exchange reserves must be liquid, marketable, and expressed in a convertible currency with a high credit rating. The Bank of Korea further stated that, to date, no discussions or reviews have taken place regarding Bitcoin’s inclusion in reserves. They said, “There has been no discussion or review of Bitcoin’s inclusion in foreign exchange reserves so far. It is known that some countries, such as the Czech Republic and Brazil, have expressed positive opinions, but the European Central Bank ( ECB ), the Swiss National Bank, and the Japanese government have expressed negative opinions.” This announcement comes amid broader global debates, with U.S. President Donald Trump recently signing an executive order for a strategic Bitcoin stockpile, although this would involve only Bitcoin seized through legal processes, not new federal purchases.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|ASIA|EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-17 03:35:25

Officials from the Korean central bank said in a March 16 response to a written inquiry that they have not looked into a potential Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve, citing high volatility. Responding to a question from Representative Cha Gyu-geun of the National Assembly’s Planning and Finance Committee, central bankers said that they have “neither discussed nor reviewed the possible inclusion of Bitcoin in foreign exchange reserves, adding that “a cautious approach is needed,” according to the Korea Herald. “Bitcoin’s price volatility is very high,” the central bank noted, before adding that “in the case of cryptocurrency market instability, transaction costs to cash out Bitcoins could rise drastically.” Over the past 30 days, Bitcoin prices have swung wildly between $98,000 and $76,000 before settling at current levels of around $83,000 in a 15% decline since Feb. 16, according to CoinGecko. The decision comes amid increasing global discussions on the role of crypto assets in national financial strategies, sparked by US President Donald Trump’s executive order earlier this month establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve and digital asset stockpile. At a seminar on March 6, crypto industry lobbyists, and some members of Korea’s Democratic Party urged the country to integrate Bitcoin into its national reserves and develop a won-backed stablecoin. However, the Bank of Korea emphasized that its foreign exchange reserves must have liquidity and be immediately usable when needed, as well as a credit rating of investment grade or higher, criteria that Bitcoin does not meet, in its opinion. Professor Yang Jun-seok of Catholic University of Korea concurred, stating “it is appropriate for foreign exchange to be held in proportion to the currencies of countries with which we trade,” Professor Kang Tae-soo from the KAIST Graduate School of Finance commented on the US being likely to leverage stablecoins rather than BTC to maintain dollar hegemony before adding, “Whether the IMF will recognize stablecoins as foreign exchange reserves in the future is important.” Related: Democrat lawmaker urges Treasury to cease Trump’s Bitcoin reserve plans Earlier this month, South Korea’s financial regulator examined the Japanese Financial Services Agency’s legislative trend toward crypto assets as it mulls lifting a ban on crypto exchange-traded funds in the country.

Support Levels to Watch Currently, XRP is testing an important support zone between $2.25 and $2.30. As of now, the price is holding steady within this range. If it successfully bounces from here, it could set up a short-term bullish trend. A confirmed bounce could push XRP up toward the next resistance levels between $2.65 and $2.80. However, resistance at $2.50 might slow down the momentum. What If XRP Breaks Support? On the other hand, if XRP fails to hold support and the price falls below $2.25, it would indicate a potential retracement toward the next critical support area, around $1.95 to $2.05. This price action would align with the larger sideways trend XRP has been in for the past several weeks. Looking Ahead: What Could Happen? Looking at the broader picture, XRP is still holding within a sideways range between $1.20 and $2.80. This range suggests the price may experience more choppy and unpredictable movements. While some analysts are hopeful for a breakout, XRP has not shown any clear signs of a strong bullish impulse, particularly as it continues to struggle below major resistance levels. In terms of long-term price targets, if the market starts to show positive momentum, the $5 to $5.65 range could be possible, but this depends heavily on the market maintaining the critical $2 support level. A decisive break below this support could signal a bearish scenario, pushing XRP lower into the support range and possibly leading to a more significant correction.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|ALTCOIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-17 04:09:07

Popular economist Peter Schiff believes that if Nasdaq enters the bear market correcting 40% from the peak, BTC price can collapse all the way to $20K. NASDAQ Decline and Bitcoin Price Correlation Amid the brutal US stock market correction over the last few weeks, the NASDAQ index is down by 12%. Economist Peter Schiff believes that things could turn brutal for BTC if the correction slips further into a bear market. The Bitcoin price shares a historical correlation with Nasdaq. A 12% NASDAQ decline often equates to a 24% drop in Bitcoin, placing it at approximately $65,000. If the NASDAQ continues to drop by 20%, Bitcoin could align at $55,000. However, Schiff added that Nasdaq has historically seen even greater corrections while slipping into the bear market territory. The economist stated that during the Dot-com bubble, the NASDAQ fell nearly 80%, while it declined 55% during the 2008 financial crisis and 30% during the COVID crash in 2020. Considering an average 55% decline, Schiff believes that even a 40% drop in Nasdaq index could push BTC price lower to $20,000. “A drop of this magnitude would likely accelerate Bitcoin’s collapse to much lower levels,” Schiff stated . However, Peter Schiff is not alone in predicting a Bitcoin price crash to such lower levels. Last week, Bloomberg analyst Mike McGlone predicted a BTC crash to $10K , while Gold has been on a very strong upside rally. For the near term, all eyes will be on the upcoming US Fed decision following the cooling US inflation data for the month of February. Traders are positioning themselves for the same with a strong surge in daily trading volumes. Gold’s Negative Correlation With Nasdaq In contrast to Bitcoin, gold has shown a negative correlation with the NASDAQ. Since the NASDAQ peaked on December 16, 2023, gold has risen 13%, demonstrating an inverse relationship. Economist Peter Schiff stated that if the NASDAQ undergoes a 40% decline, gold could soar past $3,800. These gains could further extend if the bear market leads to a significant decline in the US Dollar, says Schiff. At $3,800 gold and $20,000 Bitcoin, Schiff projected Bitcoin’s value in terms of gold would plunge over 85%, challenging Bitcoin’s narrative as a store of value. Schiff Predicts US Might Give Up On Bitcoin Reserve Plans The economist stated that the divergence in the value of Bitcoin price and Gold could challenge the cryptocurrency’s status as “digital gold”. Thus, Peter Schiff believes that this could further push away the governments or ETF investors to hold Bitcoin in reserves. He added that massive selling pressure would make it “impossible” for companies like MicroStrategy to liquidate enough Bitcoin to avoid financial distress. Over the past weekend, Bitcoin and the broader crypto markets haven’t shown much of a movement. As press time, Bitcoin is trading 0.66% down at $83,742 with its daily trading volume up by 79% to more than $23.21 billion.

The dispute, which began under the Biden administration, has raised questions about the future of the cryptocurrency. According to Fox News, the delay in reaching a final agreement is due to Ripple negotiating more favorable terms related to a district court ruling that imposed a $125 million fine on the company. The ruling also included a permanent injunction preventing Ripple from selling XRP tokens to institutional investors. Legal expert Jeremy Hogan suggested that a private settlement with the SEC could bring the lawsuit to an end without the need for a court battle. Hogan stated that if a settlement is reached, the case could be wrapped up in a matter of days, providing much-needed clarity for Ripple and the broader market. This would allow Ripple to move forward, giving institutions the green light to engage with XRP and ushering in a new era for the cryptocurrency. Hogan had previously said, “The only way the case could “be over” soon is if Ripple and the SEC reach a private settlement agreement (which would vary from the judgment), dismiss the appeal, and then simply never take the terms of the settlement agreement back to the trial court to be ratified. This is possible but, assuming the injunction is the sticking point, the SEC would have to agree not to enforce the Court’s injunction.” To my knowledge they never have. I assume it’s a legal requirement but it’s one of those things so built into the process that nobody questions it. — Marc Fagel (@Marc_Fagel) March 15, 2025 However, former SEC lawyer Marc Fagel pointed out that there is no such thing as a “private” settlement with the SEC. All SEC settlements are public and must be reviewed by a court. Fagel added that while it may seem like a routine process, it is legally required for transparency and oversight.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-17 04:54:13

Still, a crypto whale has taken a contrarian stance by raising a leveraged bearish bet on BTC worth millions on Hyperliquid while betting bullish on the MELANIA token. As of writing, the whale held a short position in BTC perpetual futures worth over $445 million, generating an unrealized gain of $1.3 million. The position employed a 40x leverage and a liquidation price of $86,000, according to data source Hyperliquid and Lookonchain . The outsized short anticipating a bitcoin price slide made waves on social media X on Sunday as pseudonymous trader CBB invited other market participants for a consortium of bulls aimed at liquidating the whale. ""11 hours ago, @Cbb0fe publicly formed a team to hunt this whale who shorted $BTC with 40x leverage. Just one hour later, the team was in action, driving $BTC above $84,690 in a short period,"" blockchain sleuth Lookonchain said on X. ""The whale was forced to deposit $5M USDC to increase margin and avoid liquidation. But the hunt ultimately failed,"" Lookonchain added. As of writing, the crypto whale also held a 5x leveraged long position in the MELANIA perpetual futures, anticipating a price rise in the memecoin reportedly marketed by MKT World LLC, a Florida-registered company owned by Melania Trump, the wife of U.S. President Donald Trump. Hyperliquid cheered the whole episode on X, saying the transparency of trading positions on its platform has redefined trading. ""When a whale shorts $450M+ BTC and wants a public audience, it's only possible on Hyperliquid. When headlines say ""Bitcoin Market on Edge,"" they are equating ""Hyperliquid"" with the ""market."" Anyone can photoshop a PNL screenshot. No one can question a Hyperliquid position, just like no one can question a Bitcoin balance. The decentralized future is here,"" Hyperliquid said . The platform was in the news last week after an influential whale executed the so-called ""liquidation arbitrage"" by extracting floating profits, leading to a margin shortage.

Social engineering attacks have also escalated, with hackers breaching Kaito AI’s social media to manipulate token prices and crypto founders being targeted through fake Zoom calls containing malware. Additionally, high-profile security breaches and physical attacks are also becoming more of a problem, especially after the recent armed home invasion of streamer Kaitlyn Siragusa. Fake Crypto Exchange Emails Trick Users The crypto industry is facing a surge in phishing scams targeting users of major exchanges like Coinbase and Gemini. Cybercriminals have been sending fraudulent emails that seem to come from these platforms, instructing users to transition to self-custodial wallets. The emails provide detailed instructions on downloading the legitimate Coinbase Wallet or Gemini's wallet service but include pre-generated recovery phrases that are controlled by scammers. Once users set up wallets using these phrases and transfer their assets, the threat actors can instantly drain their funds. In an attempt to add credibility, the fraudulent emails reference ongoing legal battles. The Coinbase-related scam falsely claims that a court ruling forced the exchange to operate as a registered broker, mandating users to move their assets to self-custodial wallets. It even mentions a class-action lawsuit against Coinbase over unregistered securities sales, although the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently dismissed its case against the exchange on Feb. 27. Similarly, Gemini users have been targeted with emails that refer to a supposed court decision requiring them to migrate to a new wallet. The SEC previously sued Gemini over its Earn program, but the case was also dropped on Feb. 26. Coinbase acknowledged the scam , and warned its users never to trust pre-generated recovery phrases. The company reiterated that it will never send such phrases and urged users to stay vigilant. Gemini has yet to officially respond to the reports. Phishing is still one of the most serious security threats in the crypto industry. Blockchain security firm CertiK’s annual Web3 security report revealed that phishing scams cost users more than $1 billion in 2024 alone, with 296 reported incidents. The issue is not limited to email scams. In fact, cybercriminals have also been targeting crypto founders through sophisticated social engineering tactics. At least three founders recently reported that they narrowly avoided a hacking attempt involving fake Zoom meetings . The attackers posed as potential business partners and, during the call, claimed to have audio issues before sending a link to a new meeting, which contained malware that is designed to steal sensitive information. With the rise of these increasingly deceptive attacks, crypto users and industry leaders are urged to be extra cautious. Kaito AI Hit by Social Media Hack Meanwhile, Kaito AI and its founder Yu Hu recently fell victim to a social media hack on March 15, with hackers taking control of the project's X account to spread false information. The attackers claimed that Kaito wallets were compromised and warned users that their funds were not safe. These posts were part of a broader scheme to manipulate the price of KAITO tokens, as on-chain investigator DeFi Warhol revealed that the hackers opened a short position on KAITO before making the fraudulent announcements. By inducing panic selling, the perpetrators planned to crash the token’s price and profit from the market drop. The Kaito AI team quickly regained control of their social media account and reassured its users that there was no breach of Kaito wallets. The team stated that despite having strong security measures in place, the attack bore similarities to recent incidents involving hacked Twitter accounts. This case adds to the increasing number of social engineering attacks and security breaches that are currently affecting the crypto industry. Several high-profile exploits popped up over the past few months. On Feb. 26, the X account of Pump.fun, a fair launch platform, was hacked by an attacker promoting fraudulent tokens, including a fake governance token named ”Pump.” Blockchain investigator ZackXBT later connected this incident to hacks targeting the Jupiter DAO account and the DogWifCoin X account. In another case, the Alberta Securities Commission issued a warning on March 7 about a crypto scam known as CanCap. The scheme relied on fake news articles and counterfeit endorsements using the images of Canadian politicians to lure victims. By playing on the fears of a trade war between Canada and the United States, scammers claimed that the project had the backing of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to entice investors. Attackers are employing increasingly sophisticated tactics to manipulate markets and defraud investors, making it crucial for users to verify information before making any financial decisions. Four Charged in Home Invasion Targeting Bitcoin Another major security issue plaguing crypto users is burglaries. Four suspects were charged in connection with the violent home invasion of online streamer Kaitlyn Siragusa, who is known as Amouranth. The attack took place on March 2, when several armed people entered her home, held her at gunpoint, and demanded access to her cryptocurrency holdings. Authorities identified two of the suspects as Dylan Nesho Campbell and Bryan Anthony Salazar Guerrero, while the remaining two are minors aged 16 and 17. Each suspect faces charges of aggravated kidnapping and aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon. Siragusa reported that the intruders beat her and tried to coerce her into handing over her private keys. Her husband, who was on speakerphone during the ordeal, realized the severity of the situation and grabbed a handgun while monitoring the invaders' movements through the home's security cameras. The armed men took the phone, believing they could use it to access a crypto app, while Siragusa managed to stall them by leading them around the house in search of a cold storage device. While the intruders were distracted, Siragusa ran upstairs to her husband, who fired three shots at the suspects. One of the rounds may have struck one of the attackers before they fled the scene. Law enforcement arrived shortly after to secure the area and investigate the attempted robbery. The attack was very likely financially motivated, as Siragusa previously shared to her followers that she held around 211 Bitcoin, which was worth more than $20 million in late 2024. 7 gang members arrested in the UK for kidnapping The incident adds to a growing wave of targeted kidnappings and home invasions against cryptocurrency holders. In January of 2025, a UK court sentenced seven gang members involved in the prolonged kidnapping and assault of a crypto investor, who was coerced into transferring funds. That same month, Ledger co-founder David Balland was kidnapped in France and held for ransom before being rescued by authorities.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|BUSINESS|REGULATION|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-17 04:58:26

As the blockchain continues to evolve, its network activity has seen fluctuations, with shifting trends in meme coin trading and growing institutional interest in regulated derivatives. The introduction of Solana futures follows the path set by Bitcoin and Ethereum, potentially paving the way for a SOL ETF as asset managers increasingly seek exposure to the cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, major industry players like FalconX and StoneX are facilitating institutional access to Solana through the first-ever CME Solana futures block trade. Solana Celebrates Five Years: A Look at Its Journey and Future Prospects Solana (SOL), the blockchain known for its speed and scalability, marked its five-year anniversary on Sunday, a major milestone for the network that has grown to become the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Despite recent fluctuations in network activity, Solana continues to position itself as a leading player in the crypto space, with significant developments on the horizon. ”Happy Solana 0 block day to all those who celebrate,” wrote Anatoly Yakovenko, Solana’s co-founder, in a post on X. Several key projects that originated on the Solana blockchain also joined in the celebrations, including Phantom Wallet and the viral meme coin launchpad Pump.fun. Since its launch, Solana has been recognized for its high-speed transactions and low fees, making it a favored blockchain for DeFi projects, NFTs, and meme coins. However, the past five years have not been without challenges, from network outages to regulatory uncertainty and the collapse of FTX, one of its biggest backers. The FTX collapse in November 2022 sent SOL’s price plummeting below $10, shaking investor confidence. However, Solana's resilience was evident, as the network recovered to its 2022 peak price levels before settling at around $127 today. Solana co-founder Raj Gokal previously described this period as a ”crucible moment” for the blockchain, one that tested its durability and commitment to decentralization. Despite celebrating its anniversary, Solana has seen a decline in active users in recent months. The number of active addresses on the network has been dropping since November 2023, and March is expected to record even fewer active users than February. This decline is closely tied to the waning popularity of Pump.fun, a meme coin launchpad that became one of the fastest-growing crypto startups in history. Launched in May 2024, Pump.fun achieved an astonishing $100 million in cumulative revenue in just 217 days. However, recent meme coin scandals, including a political controversy involving the President of Argentina, have caused investor sentiment to shift. As a result, the percentage of tokens ”graduating” from Pump.fun to Solana’s decentralized exchange Raydium dropped to just 0.66% on Saturday, the lowest level since the platform’s early days. This metric serves as a barometer for meme coin trading enthusiasm, and its decline suggests that speculative interest in the sector has cooled off. The Firedancer Upgrade: A Game-Changer for Solana While network activity may be slowing down, Solana's development team is pushing forward with major upgrades aimed at solidifying the blockchain’s long-term scalability. One of the most anticipated updates is the launch of Jump Crypto’s Firedancer, an alternative high-performance validator client that is expected to significantly boost Solana’s speed and resilience. A prototype version of the software, Frankendancer, was launched in September 2023, providing a preview of the benefits that Firedancer could bring. The full rollout of Firedancer is expected in 2025, with key figures in the Solana community—such as Helius co-founder Mert Mumtaz—predicting a launch by the end of Q2. Firedancer will help Solana move closer to its ambitious goal of processing 1 million transactions per second (TPS), further cementing its reputation as one of the fastest blockchains in the industry. By diversifying its validator clients, Solana also aims to reduce its risk of network outages, a problem that has plagued the blockchain in the past. Another major development that could drive demand for Solana is the potential approval of Solana-based ETFs . Several asset management firms have filed applications for ETFs that include SOL, and analysts have identified Solana as one of the most likely cryptocurrencies to receive approval, alongside Litecoin (LTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), and XRP. An ETF approval would be a major milestone for Solana, making it more accessible to institutional investors and potentially leading to a surge in demand. With Ethereum ETFs already gaining traction, Solana’s inclusion in a fund could position it as the next major institutional-friendly crypto asset. Despite recent setbacks in network activity, Solana’s long-term trajectory remains strong. The blockchain has demonstrated resilience in the face of adversity, bouncing back from the FTX collapse and continuing to develop its infrastructure with the Firedancer upgrade. If network adoption stabilizes, and ETF approvals come through, Solana could be positioned for another major price breakout in 2025. However, the meme coin sector’s decline and ongoing regulatory concerns could continue to weigh on short-term sentiment. FalconX Executes First Block Trade for CME Group’s Solana Futures Ahead of Market Launch In related news, digital asset prime broker FalconX has successfully executed the first-ever block trade for CME Group's Solana futures, marking a significant milestone in the regulated trading of SOL derivatives. The trade, conducted with StoneX as a counterparty, came just a day before the official launch of CME Group’s Solana futures contracts, set for March 17. The move is part of FalconX’s broader strategy to enhance institutional participation in Solana’s growing futures market, according to Josh Barkhordar, head of US sales at the firm. CME Group, one of the world's leading derivatives exchanges, introduced Solana futures contracts in late February in response to rising institutional demand. The contracts are structured similarly to Bitcoin and Ethereum futures, which historically served as precursors to ETF approvals by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The new Solana futures contracts come in two sizes: Standard contracts: Representing 500 SOL each Micro contracts: Representing 25 SOL each Both are cash-settled, using the CME CF Solana-Dollar Reference Rate, calculated daily at 4:00 p.m. London time to provide a standardized benchmark for SOL’s US dollar price. With major institutions seeking regulated exposure to Solana, industry experts see this launch as a significant step toward a potential SOL ETF. Following the CME Group's launch of Solana futures, several asset management firms have submitted applications to the SEC for spot Solana ETFs. Among the notable applicants: Franklin Templeton (managing over $1.5 trillion in assets) filed for a SOL ETF in late February 2025. Grayscale, 21Shares, Bitwise, VanEck, and Canary Capital have also entered the race, hoping to bring Solana-based investment products to institutional investors. The move follows the regulatory pattern set by Bitcoin and Ethereum, where futures trading preceded the eventual SEC approval of spot ETFs. Analysts suggest Solana's ETF approval could be a reality in 2025, given the growing institutional interest and the SEC's evolving stance on crypto-based investment products. As a key liquidity provider for CME Group’s crypto derivatives, FalconX has been aggressively expanding its presence in institutional markets. The firm has reported executing over $1.5 trillion in trading volume, covering 400+ tokens for around 600 institutional clients. Recent strategic acquisitions further bolster its footprint: In January 2025, FalconX acquired Arbelos Markets, a derivatives platform specializing in institutional-grade crypto options and futures trading. In February 2024, FalconX partnered with TP ICAP’s Fusion Digital Assets, strengthening its liquidity and data solutions offerings. These moves reinforce FalconX’s role as a leading prime broker for institutions looking to trade regulated digital asset products. The launch of Solana futures comes amid a strong surge in demand for CME’s crypto derivatives offerings. The exchange has reported: 202,000 average daily contracts traded in early 2025, marking a 73% increase year-over-year. 243,600 average open interest contracts, up 55% year-over-year. Over 11,300 unique accounts actively trading crypto derivatives on the platform. Solana Derivatives Trading Booms Amid Market Pullback On centralized crypto exchanges, Solana futures have also experienced a significant increase in trading activity. Data from Coinglass shows: Solana derivatives volume surged 66% to $7.24 billion, reflecting bullish sentiment. Long/short ratios remain above 2, indicating a bias toward long positions despite recent liquidations. $12.29 million in 24-hour liquidations suggest high volatility, as traders navigate Solana’s price fluctuations.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,SOL|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-17 05:00:00

In a recent tweet, Farina stated , “Whales are desperately trying to exit Ethereum. They need liquidity to survive. Expect this capital to flow towards $XRP.” This assertion suggests that large-scale Ethereum holders (“whales”) seek liquidity, potentially redirecting their investments to XRP. Whales are desperately trying to exit Ethereum. They need liquidity to survive. Expect this capital to flow towards $XRP — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) March 15, 2025 Community Reactions The crypto community had mixed reactions to Farina’s statement. Juicy.stack expressed skepticism about abandoning Ethereum in favor of XRP, questioning why anyone would leave Ethereum “to buy the single thing that has actually performed worse over the last 7-8 years.” This sentiment reflects concerns over XRP’s historical price performance compared to Ethereum. Marat took a more critical view of Ethereum’s future, claiming that it was in its final stages, “We are witnessing $ETH taking its last few breaths.” He argued that there was “absolutely no way” Ethereum could reach $4,000 or set a new all-time high, indicating a belief that the asset’s best days are behind it. Sasha countered this perspective by highlighting Ethereum’s strong ecosystem, noting that XRP “doesn’t have a shadow of the ecosystem of dapps” found on Ethereum. He specifically mentioned projects like Ondo and Quant, questioning why they were not built on the XRPL. His remarks emphasize Ethereum’s established role in decentralized applications, a key factor many investors consider when evaluating its long-term viability. These differing opinions underscore the ongoing debate about Ethereum’s position in the market and whether XRP presents a viable alternative. Current Market Overview As of press time, Ethereum is trading at approximately $1,937, experiencing a 0.3% decline over the past 24 hours. This price point is notably below its all-time high of $4,862.10, recorded on November 10, 2021. In contrast, XRP trades at $2.42, reflecting a 2.54% increase over the last 24 hours. The cryptocurrency has shown resilience and growth potential, attracting attention from investors seeking alternatives to Ethereum. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ethereum’s Ecosystem and Future Prospects Despite current market challenges, Ethereum maintains a robust ecosystem, particularly in decentralized finance (DeFi). The platform hosts a multitude of dApps, including notable projects like Ondo and Quant, which contribute to its extensive utility and adoption. This established infrastructure is a critical consideration for investors evaluating long-term prospects. However, some analysts caution about potential risks within the DeFi sector if Ethereum’s price declines significantly. A drop to $1,000 could trigger substantial liquidations and dampen investor interest in DeFi platforms reliant on Ethereum. XRP’s Position and Potential XRP has gained attention due to its unique consensus mechanism and focus on facilitating efficient cross-border payments . Farina has expressed optimism about XRP’s future, suggesting that a price of $20 could be just the beginning for even higher price levels. This perspective aligns with the views of some investors who see XRP as a viable alternative amidst Ethereum’s current market challenges. The cryptocurrency market is characterized by rapid changes and diverse opinions. Edo Farina’s recent comments have sparked discussions about the potential shift of capital from Ethereum to XRP. While Ethereum continues to offer a comprehensive ecosystem with numerous dApps, current market conditions have led some investors to explore alternatives like XRP.

This move allows us to implement additional upgrades to prevent further misuse.” The OKX helpdesk confirmed that the DEX aggregator was temporarily suspended for an “internal review and upgrade” but did not provide a timeline. It added that crypto wallet services will remain available to all customers, but it will “pause new wallet creation in select markets during this time.” Source: OKX On March 11, Bloomberg reported that European Union financial watchdogs were investigating the firm’s DEX aggregator, called OKX Web3, and its wallet services for their alleged role in laundering funds from the Bybit hack. “Over the past few days, we’ve faced targeted media attacks questioning our integrity and operations,” the firm stated in a blog post. It added that it “can’t ignore the fact that these attacks are happening at a time when we are actively fighting against financial crime.” According to Bybit CEO Ben Zhou , nearly $100 million from the $1.5 billion Bybit hack had been laundered through OKX’s Web3 proxy, with a portion of the funds now untraceable. OKX responded on March 11, stating that the “Bloomberg article is misleading,” saying that when Bybit was hacked, OKX reacted in two ways: by freezing associated funds from moving into its CEX, and developing the new hack detection features. Related: Lazarus Group sends 400 ETH to Tornado Cash, deploys new malware OKX stated that the goal is to ensure that explorers properly highlight the actual DEX processing trades “rather than mistakenly identifying our aggregator as the point of trade.” The exchange has already deployed a “hacker address detection system” for its DEX aggregator in addition to a system to track the hacker’s latest addresses and block them on its centralized exchange in real time. “We already rolled out a lot of controls for OKX Web3 to fight with the misuse, including prohibited markets’ IP blocking and real-time black address detection and blocking system,” said OKX CEO Star Xu on March 17. The firm also clarified that the OKX Web3 DEX aggregator is not a custodian of customer assets, adding that its function is to provide access to liquidity across multiple protocols. However, “some have deliberately misrepresented our platform,” it said.

While the trend remains highly bearish on the daily chart, it has retraced briefly up following a double-digit gain in the last 72 hours. ATOM has continued to show signs of weakness on the daily timeframe following a consistent roller coaster in the last three months. It appeared to have slowed down a bit following a recent bounce off the $0.39 level. This level marked its lowest price in a year, and from the look of things, more breakdowns are underway as the market structure remains bearish from a short-term perspective. While the next breakdown may trigger more losses, it should signal a bearish extension on the mid-term scale. As seen on the daily chart, the descending trendline has been serving as resistance since last December. If the price manages to break above it, we may a major price retracement before resuming bearish at full speed. Retracing above the peak level should confirm a complete trend reversal. Looking back from where it initiated fall from the peak level of $10.7, ATOM has seen more than 70% loss. This put the crypto among the top loser mid-cap altcoins in the last three months. While there are no signs of a reversal yet, its mid-term bearish momentum may last to $1 before halting. ATOM’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview The key resistance level for a retest right now lies at $4.45. If the price breaks above the descending trendline, the immediate resistance level for an increase is $5.51. Right above it lies the $6.1 resistance. Resuming selling, the weekly $3.39 low is the key support to watch for a breakdown. A new low may come at $3 and probably $2.5 in the future.

This could lead to a major trend shift, but the crypto will likely face resistance anytime soon. Unlike most mid-cap altcoins, Kava recorded less loss during the wide market correction and remained well above the $0.38 level throughout the storm. Though this price marked the crypto’s lowest level in the last four months after losing roughly half of its valuation. However, things might get worse for the crypto in the future as it forms a strong bearish pattern on a short-term scale. While it continues to hold the above price level as support, it has created a series of lower highs on the daily chart. It attempts to create a new one following the latest surge. No doubt, it will likely face rejection at the descending trendline, acting as dynamic resistance for the past four months. Once that happens, we can expect a drop capable of slipping the price back to the mentioned price level, serving as crucial parallel support since the correction began. Inversely, a successful cross above this descending trendline could bring a temporal shift in the trend. It must reclaim last December’s high before confirming a major shift. But as it stands, Kava remains under the bear’s radar despite the latest surge. A drop off the parallel support could cause a catastrophic loss in the future. KAVA’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview Following the latest surge, Kava is targeting the resistance line at $0.51. There is lots of resistance above in case of a break, but close ones to watch are $0.556 and $0.624. Above it lies $0.68. Right now, the $0.446 level is providing support, along with the recent lowest $0.38 level. Losing it could cause a serious collapse to $0.32.

This raised global concern about how safe crypto assets are for bringing them into the mainstream financial zone, as discussed by an influential figure in the EU council. Let’s dive in. ECB’s Villeroy Sounds the Alarm Francois Villeroy de Galhau, a senior member of the European Central Bank’s Governing Council, has voiced strong concerns about the US approach to crypto. In an interview with La Tribune Dimanche, he warned that financial crises often originate in the US and spread globally. By supporting digital assets and non-bank financial systems, the American administration is taking unnecessary risks that could destabilize the global economy. Villeroy assured that Europe’s financial system is well-regulated, minimizing any threat of a banking crisis. He also called for a stronger international role for the euro, urging Europe to build a powerful savings and investment union to attract global capital. Crypto as a Solution, Not a Threat Not everyone agrees with Villeroy. Crypto analyst Christopher Perkins strongly opposes his stance, arguing that digital assets reduce financial risks. He highlights the 1974 Herstatt Bank collapse as a cautionary tale of traditional finance failures. Unlike conventional assets, which take days to settle, crypto transactions occur in real time, improving liquidity and reducing systemic risks. Drawing from his experience during the Lehman Brothers collapse, Perkins stresses that liquidity is everything—and crypto enhances it. He urges Europe to embrace blockchain technology for faster settlements and improved financial security. Trump’s Memecoin Mania Beyond policy changes, Trump has also been linked to the memecoin craze. Reports suggest his family has endorsed unregulated tokens since he took office, using his political influence to pump and dump assets. Many believe he is leveraging the crypto industry to recover his election spending and build personal wealth at the expense of investors. This has drawn comparisons to past economic downturns caused by his financial strategies. Bitcoin Reserve Plan Raises Questions Meanwhile, Trump continues to push pro-crypto policies, including a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a separate digital asset stockpile. His administration has also rolled back several SEC lawsuits against crypto firms. However, analyst Bakcho_Panda highlights a major twist in the Bitcoin Reserve plan—the US is not buying BTC. Instead, it’s selling seized crypto, leading to speculation that the reserve grows only when more assets are confiscated. This raises concerns that the government may use crypto crackdowns to expand its holdings while presenting itself as a supporter of digital assets.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,FIAT|BTC|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-17 05:16:54

This includes an additional civil penalty of almost $221,500. The CFTC has proven that Debiex was faking itself as a crypto platform. On March 13th, Judge Douglas granted the CFTC’s motion for summary judgment. Douglas said Debliex did not respond to the CFTC’s claims, and there’s no evidence that it was just “excusable neglect.” CFTC filed a legal case against Debiex in January last year. It sued the platform for running a “pig butchering scam.” The scam involved scammers developing fake romantic relationships with customers on social media, after which the customers were lured into investing in the bogus platform. The platform scam-baited 5 victims. These victims made deposits of a total of $2.3 million on Debiex. Zhāng Chéng Yáng was a “money mule” for Debiex, according to CFTC. This is because his wallet was used to receive the stolen funds from the victims. On March 12, Judge Rayes approved a legal request (motion for default judgment) from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) against Zhāng. He accepted CFTC’s claims that Zhāng controlled the OKX crypto wallet “that received digital assets to which he had no legitimate claim.” The judge found that OKX was “voluntarily preserving” the funds in Zhāng’s wallet. The wallet contained $5.70 worth of USTD and up to 63 ETH, which amounted to $119,500 in total. The judge has ordered the transfer of these funds back to an unnamed victim’s account. Debiex reportedly hired female staff pretending to be successful traders CFTC claims that scammers directed the victims toward Debiex websites through social media. The platform marketed itself as a “Blockchain Network Decentralized perpetual contract trading platform.” Customers were lured under the pretense of “mining transactions” and futures trading. The details shared by CFTC state that Debiex staff consisted of women who would contact victims through “continuous and repeated messaging and sharing purported pictures of themselves.” These women portrayed themselves as “highly successful digital asset commodities traders.” According to the CFTC, once a victim created an account on Debiex’s platform and sent their cryptocurrency as a so-called investment, the platform would lie to them about the performance of their funds. This “fictitious information” was based on customer balances, profits, and trading positions. CFTC said, “All of this information was most likely false” and proved that customers’ digital assets were instead transferred to “numerous digital asset wallets in an attempt to obfuscate their destination.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

This move signals a change from its previous skepticism, where digital assets were seen as a financial risk due to their potential use in illicit activities. Now, with over 20 million active crypto users and a booming digital economy, Pakistan is embracing blockchain technology to regulate and integrate it into its financial system. Pakistan establishes Crypto Council to regulate digital assets The finance chief highlighted Pakistan’s commitment to building a regulated and responsible crypto ecosystem, integrating blockchain innovations to boost economic growth. pic.twitter.com/PqfH5bmVxe — PEconomist (@peconomist_) March 16, 2025 A Strategic Shift Toward Blockchain Pakistan’s decision to create the PCC is a big change from its earlier view that crypto was a security risk. With this new council, the country now wants to be a strong player in the global digital finance space. This comes at a key moment, as more countries are realizing the benefits of blockchain technology, and even the U.S. has set up a special Bitcoin reserve. Who’s Leading the Charge? Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb will chair the PCC, bringing together top regulatory figures, including the Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan and the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP). This high-level leadership structure ensures that blockchain integration is approached with financial stability, security, and compliance in mind. The development comes a week after the government appointed Bilal bin Saqib as the Chief Advisor to the Finance Minister for the PCC. As the council’s CEO, he has emphasized that the PCC will not just regulate but also support the growth of blockchain and digital finance in Pakistan. Why is it Necessary? The Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) has been set up to create clear rules for using cryptocurrency in the country. Its main job is to make sure crypto adoption is safe, organized, and beneficial for the economy. To do this, the council will work with international blockchain groups, learn from their experiences, and build a strong legal system that protects users from fraud or misuse. One of the biggest reasons Pakistan is embracing crypto is its huge remittance market. Every year, Pakistanis living abroad send home around $35 billion. Right now, sending money internationally can be slow and expensive, with banks and other services charging high fees. Crypto can change this by making transactions faster, cheaper, and more efficient, allowing families to receive more money with fewer deductions. This move shows that Pakistan isn’t just trying to control crypto—it wants to become an important player in the global digital economy. If the PCC successfully puts its plans into action, Pakistan could see major advancements in blockchain technology, digital finance, and economic growth. The next few months will be crucial in determining how well this council can turn its vision into reality.",News|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|TECHNOLOGY|FIAT|BTC|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-17 05:24:39

But while ETH suffers, a fresh player—prop trading firm token FXGuys ($FXG) is drawing attention. Some people are already calling it the best crypto to buy right now since analysts estimate great upside potential. We will explore in this post why $FXG could be a wise investment given growing worries about ETH’s possible downturn! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Analyst Forecasts a Drop to $1,200 as Ethereum Approaches a 16-Month Low Once Ethereum was designated as part of the U.S. Crypto Reserve, it took a wild ride! Initially sending ETH skyward to $2,500, the excitement from the major announcement on March 2, 2025, did not last long. The flagship altcoin sank 15% a day later, falling to a 16-month low of $2,035. Meanwhile, market expert Nebraskagonner, raised a warning for ETH investors by noting an alarming trend on the charts. The analyst noticed a typical double-top formation on Ethereum’s monthly chart—an unsettling indication that usually means more difficulty ahead. Nebraskagonner did not mince words when he stated that ETH may experience a serious collapse. According to the researcher, the altcoin might fall to levels not seen since the severe 2022 bear market. His breakdown? A potential decline of up to $1,200. Despite the grim outlook, there is a silver lining: $FXG, an alternate investment that may provide ETH holders with an exit strategy. Meanwhile, Ethereum has fallen 3.21% this week and is currently trading at $2,290 . The FXGuys Prop Trading Company Gives Hope to Investors As Ethereum crashes, the public presale of FXGuys presents yet another chance to make money.

Over the years, it has become one of the most active blockchain networks by transaction volume and is among the few cryptocurrencies proposed for inclusion in a US digital asset reserve. Since the first Solana block was built on March 16, 2020, the network has processed more than 408 billion transactions and nearly $1 trillion worth of value on decentralized exchanges — establishing itself as one of the industry’s leading layer-1 blockchains. Source: Solana Here are some of the Solana ecosystem’s most notable milestones since it was launched by Solana Labs CEO Anatoly Yakovenko and Solana co-founder Raj Gokal to the public in 2020. Solana was born just as the COVID-19 pandemic hit While Solana’s origins can be traced back to late 2017 when Yakovenko released a white paper outlining a timekeeping method for blockchains called “Proof of History,” but Solana wasn’t launched until March 2020 — right as the world started to enact emergency measures against the COVID-19 pandemic. The high-speed, low-cost layer 1 Solana blockchain launch was assisted by crypto-focused venture capital firm Multicoin Capital, leading a financing round for Solana, which brought in roughly $20 million worth of private token sales in July 2019. Source: OKX Additional funding poured in soon after, and within 20 months of launching, Solana was hailed as a potential “Ethereum killer” as it soared to a $77.8 billion market cap at the peak of the 2020-2021 bull cycle. Solana hit hard by 2022 bear market, FTX collapse — but bounced back The 2022 bear market, coupled with the catastrophic collapse of crypto exchange FTX , tanked Solana’s market cap to $3 billion — a whopping 96% fall from its previous peak — by late 2022. Sam Bankman-Fried’s former firm purchased around 58 million Solana tokens — currently worth $7.4 billion — from Solana Labs and the Solana Foundation. Solana was “by far the most serious” layer 1 that FTX was helping scale, Fortune said in an April 2022 report. FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Nov. 11, 2022, and is still in the process of unlocking hundreds of millions of dollars worth of staked Solana tokens from FTX’s wallets. Solana’s price fell to $8.30 on Dec. 29, 2022. Despite the setback, 2023 marked the start of Solana's impressive comeback, which saw its market cap rise nearly 50-fold from $3 billion to over $140 billion by Jan. 19, 2025. Memecoin craze takes Solana adoption to the next level One of the biggest reasons behind Solana’s comeback was the crypto memecoin craze that took place between late 2023 and 2024 — a $100 billion market that Solana dominated. Several Solana memecoins such as Bonk ( BONK ), Dogwifhat ( WIF ), Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) and Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) rose to multibillion-dollar market caps in early 2024 — around the time Solana memecoin launchpad Pump.fun became one of the most popular crypto platforms for memecoin lovers. Pump.fun alone has raked in over $540 million in revenue over the last 12 months and even surpassed Ethereum over 24-hour intervals at some points. Solana is home to many of the largest memecoins by market cap. Source: CoinGecko No Solana memecoin, however, drew more attention than the Official Trump (TRUMP) token launched by now-US President Donald Trump’s inner circle on Jan. 17 — which soared to a $14.6 billion market within two days before it came crashing down. The TRUMP memecoin briefly pushed Solana decentralized finance (DeFi) total value locked to $14.2 billion, trailing only Ethereum, DefiLlama data shows. happy 5th birthday @solana 🥳 congratulations on 5 years of building & shipping the greatest tech to ever grace our industry 🫶 manlets on top 🎉 pic.twitter.com/Clkv3eEpn9 — pump.fun (@pumpdotfun) March 16, 2025 The Solana blockchain has also become the third largest adopter of stablecoins behind Ethereum and Tron. Solana unveils the first major crypto phone In May 2023, Solana released the first major crypto phone, called “Solana Saga.” Sales for the Android device with the built-in crypto wallet started slow but skyrocketed after a 30 million BONK airdrop enticed memecoin enthusiasts to make a purchase. Solana also unveiled a newer, shinier Solana “Seeker” smartphone last September to better facilitate memecoin trading and accrue token rewards. While most reviewers say the Solana phones lack the technical capabilities of an iPhone or Google Pixel, Solana has seen over 140,000 presales for the two products. The Solana Seeker phone is currently priced at $500. Hardware specifications of the Solana Seeker phone. Source: Solana Mobile Solana, however, has also been plagued with several network outages over its five-year span — halting block production for 20 hours in some instances. Solana validators have been forced to restart the network on several occasions when network activity surged. A new independent validator client called Firedancer is scheduled to go live on Solana’s mainnet sometime in 2025 to address Solana’s client diversity woes. It has been touted as a superior solution to “QUIC” — a Google-developed data transfer protocol that has failed to process transactions on Solana over a dozen times. Solana set to be included in Trump’s Digital Asset Stockpile The Trump administration says it will include Solana in the Digital Asset Stockpile, which it confirmed through an executive order on March 7. It is the youngest cryptocurrency on the list. The Digital Asset Stockpile will initially use cryptocurrency forfeited in government criminal cases. Related: Solana proposal to cut inflation rate by up to 80% fails to pass The US doesn’t appear to hold Solana, according to crypto analytics firm Arkham Intelligence. However, the White House said it would complete an audit of crypto asset holdings. Trump initially announced that Solana would become a US reserve asset on March 2. Source: Donald Trump However, he later established a Bitcoin-only reserve and the Digital Asset Stockpile, which looks like it will include Solana in addition to Ether ( ETH ), XRP ( XRP ) and Cardano ( ADA ). Solana is currently priced at $128.17 — the sixth-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $64.5 billion. Solana is down 56% from its all-time high as the broader market continues to navigate through recession fears and weakened market sentiment of late.

Amidst all this volatility, one Shiba Inu trader has raised the alarm, predicting a staggering 7900% surge for a rival token priced at under 20 cents—potentially reaching $16 within a time frame that is turning skeptics into wholehearted believers. Let us find out why analysts and investors agree. Shiba Inu Price Undergoes A Meme Coin Reality Check Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains a crypto legend, but the glitz is thinning out in 2025. The token on March 13 stands at $0.0000128 , tumbling hard from its January high of $0.000042—an over 40% plunge that has been fueled by a 6% fall in just the last 2 weeks alone. In ecosystem developments, Shibarium’s 24-hour transactions surged to nearly 2,000%, which signifies new interest in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and maybe a turn around in prices. The movement signifies growing traction in the network after a session of low activity levels. The Shiba Inu price narrative is marred by stuck ecosystem projects. Integration with NFT and updates to ShibaSwap haven’t done much to shake the boat, and the token’s destiny continues to ride in lockstep with Bitcoin. Analysts at Coincodex have a mixture of bullish and bearish Shiba Inu price predictions at a projected high of $0.000025 by late March, but a significant decline to $0.000011 in the next 3 months unless some gigantic event happens. Remittix (RTX): The PayFi Visionary Redefining Crypto Wealth Remittix (RTX) is entering the scene as a PayFi trailblazer ready to redefine cross-border finance. Unlike hype-based meme coins, Remittix utilizes blockchain to facilitate instant , affordable transactions with added security, combining decentralized finance and real-world FIAT transaction settlements. This combination facilitates a smooth on-ramp and off-ramp between digital and fiat markets, offering a platform that is greater than a currency but a financial revolution in the making. Remittix’s presale outcomes have been nothing short of incredible. At $0.0734 per token, it has raised close to $13.9 million in its phases, with momentum picking up. Daily token sales are gaining pace, a testament to investor enthusiasm for a project promising to run transactions at a fraction of conventional expense. Many Shiba Inu price analysts are buzzing, predicting a $16 valuation in Q4 2025—a 7900% gain that could turn a modest investment into a fortune in a few months. Remittix is better compared to Shiba Inu. SHIB’s over 40% decline YoY highlights its hype dependence, whereas RTX’s rise hinges on a PayFi model delivering real utility. Shiba Inu’s once booming community is fizzling, whereas that of Remittix is rallying around a cause of revolution. Being Late To Remittix New ICO Is Dangerous Play; Analysts Warn The crypto trend is evolving, and Remittix is surfing the wave. With presale inching towards conclusion and currently at $0.0734 per token, the chance to be part of a 7900% potential project by the end of 2025 is fast approaching. It’s not a gamble on viral phenomena—it’s an intelligent investment in a PayFi pioneer set to revolutionize global finance.

On November 5, 2024 , Josh Mandell , a former Wall Street trader , publicly called his shot when Bitcoin was trading at $74K . His prophecy, cryptic yet poetic, hinted at a massive Bitcoin rally —potentially reaching $444,000 per BTC . Could this prophecy come true? What do the mysterious dates mean? How accurate has Mandell been so far? Let’s break down the prophecy and what it could mean for Bitcoin’s price action this cycle. Who is Josh Mandell? Josh Mandell isn’t just another crypto influencer—he’s a seasoned trader with a deep background in traditional finance . His Credentials: Salomon Brothers (1990-1998): The legendary trading firm from Liar’s Poker . Caxton Associates: One of the most prestigious hedge funds. Bitcoin & MSTR Trader: Actively trading and sharing insights publicly. Unlike many anonymous Bitcoin forecasters, Mandell’s track record and experience give credibility to his market insights. Why Should You Trust His Bitcoin Judgment? As Bitcoiners say: “Don’t trust, verify.” Josh Mandell has been publicly trading Bitcoin and MicroStrategy (MSTR) for over a year. His trades and analysis are available for scrutiny, and he initially seeded his portfolio with $2.1 million . While no one can predict Bitcoin’s price with certainty, his background in macro trading and market cycles makes his call worth considering. The Prophecy: A Breakdown On November 5, 2024 , Josh Mandell made The Prophecy , predicting a major Bitcoin price movement. Let’s analyze the key elements of his message: “When $84K becomes the base…” Suggests that Bitcoin would stabilize above $84,000 before making its next major move. So far, Bitcoin has traded above $84K for some time , validating this part of the call. “360 more … A trio of fours, times a grand.” This cryptic phrase seems to imply a move from $84K to $444K ( three fours, times $1,000 ). In other words, he sees $444K as Bitcoin’s potential peak this cycle . Decoding the Important Dates Josh’s prophecy mentioned three key dates : November 7, 2024: Bitcoin was trading at $74K and was on the verge of breaking out. January 16, 2025: A critical point in the cycle. (Did Bitcoin confirm a new uptrend?) March 14, 2025: A major event or price action shift is expected. So far, Bitcoin has followed a strong uptrend since his initial call, adding credibility to his forecast. Could Bitcoin Really Reach $444K? A $444,000 Bitcoin price sounds ambitious, but it’s not entirely impossible. Here’s how it could happen: Bitcoin’s 4-Year Cycle Pattern – Historically, Bitcoin sees parabolic moves after each halving. A peak near $400K+ would align with past cycle expansions. Institutional Demand – ETFs and large funds are accumulating BTC at record rates . Supply shock + demand surge could drive prices exponentially higher . Global Liquidity Trends – Central banks are pivoting back to easy monetary policy , fueling risk-on assets like Bitcoin. If Bitcoin follows its historical post-halving trend , a peak near $400K-$500K isn’t out of the question . What If The Prophecy Fails? Even the best traders aren’t right 100% of the time . If Bitcoin doesn’t reach $444K, it doesn’t mean the prophecy was worthless. It could simply mean: Bitcoin peaks at a lower target (e.g., $250K or $300K). The cycle extends longer than expected (into late 2025 or 2026). Macroeconomic factors (recession, regulations) slow Bitcoin’s growth. Regardless of the exact target, Josh Mandell’s insight suggests Bitcoin’s uptrend is far from over . Final Thoughts: Is This the Cycle of $444K? Josh Mandell’s Bitcoin prophecy is one of the boldest price calls this cycle . His $84K base call has already played out. Key cycle dates have aligned with major moves. The possibility of $444K BTC remains open. What do YOU think? Will Bitcoin reach $444K this cycle? Or is this prophecy too ambitious? Conclusion: The Bitcoin Prophecy Unfolds Josh Mandell’s Bitcoin prophecy is still in motion . $84K base? Confirmed. Next major target? $444K. Will it happen? Time will tell. Regardless of the exact price, Mandell’s call reinforces the massive upside potential of Bitcoin this cycle . Will Bitcoin make history again? Stay tuned.",Crypto News|Press Release|bitcoin price prediction|Bitcoin prophecy|Josh Mandell Bitcoin forecast,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoin World', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinworld,2025-03-17 05:35:27
41792140,https://coinpedia.org/?p=432340,1742189791,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,North Korea’s $1.14 Billion Bitcoin Stash Puts It Among the Top 3 Government Holders,https://coinpedia.org/news/lazarus-groups-1-4b-crypto-heist-fuels-north-koreas-bitcoin-reserves/,"The post North Korea’s $1.14 Billion Bitcoin Stash Puts It Among the Top 3 Government Holders appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News North Korea has quietly climbed the ranks to become one of the largest government holders of Bitcoin, surpassing even crypto-friendly nations like El Salvador and Bhutan. This is a major concern for crypto investors as Bitcoin in weak hands can raise the concern of liquidity, followed by a massive market crash if they try to sell these crypto assets to manage their countries’ financial position. The surge comes after the Lazarus Group—a state-backed hacking syndicate—pulled off a massive cyber heist, stealing over $1.4 billion in crypto from Bybit on February 21, 2025. A large portion of the loot, initially in Ethereum, was later converted into Bitcoin, swelling North Korea’s holdings to 13,562 BTC, valued at over $1.14 billion. The U.S. and North Korea: A Tale of Two BTC Strategies While North Korea has been quietly stacking Bitcoin through illicit means, the U.S. is taking a more structured approach. President Trump’s Executive Order on March 6, 2025, officially launched the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR), positioning the U.S. as the largest government Bitcoin holder with 198,109 BTC worth a staggering $16.71 billion. As per Arkham data , the U.K., sitting in second place with 61,245 BTC ($5.17 billion), has accumulated its stash through criminal seizures rather than direct accumulation. Meanwhile, Bhutan’s Druk Holdings manages 10,635 BTC ($897.6 million), and El Salvador, one of the first nations to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, holds 6,117 BTC ($516.11 million). Is Kim Jong Un Playing the Digital Gold Game? The timing of North Korea’s Bitcoin accumulation—coinciding with the U.S. unveiling its SBR—raises eyebrows. There is a growing possibility that Kim Jong Un is making a strategic play in the digital asset space, using stolen Bitcoin as a shadow reserve. Unlike traditional reserves of gold or fiat currency, Bitcoin offers a decentralized and censorship-resistant alternative, allowing nations to store wealth outside of global financial oversight. For North Korea, this is particularly advantageous, as sanctions have long restricted its access to international banking systems. By accumulating Bitcoin, Pyongyang secures an asset that can be used for global transactions without relying on the dollar-based financial network. While the U.S. frames its reserve as a financial strategy, North Korea’s BTC buildup appears to be a silent power move, blurring the lines between cybercrime and state policy. This marks a new phase in the geopolitical power struggle, where digital assets play a key role in economic and strategic dominance. Crypto Reaction is Negative The crypto space is fearing North Korea’s bitcoin gamble; many call their illegal Bitcoin holdings a political move to put pressure on the US government. The digital gold rush isn’t just about investment, it’s a geopolitical chess match. — Elize Millard (@ElizeMillard) March 16, 2025 Others are looking forward to the US taking action before other countries take control.

With the ability to leverage up to a healthy level of 2x, users can now tap into the demonstrable yield potential of bbSOL, potentially unlocking greater earning opportunities. As of Mar. 17, 2025, the net APR of Bybit Margin Staked SOL on Bybit stood at over 13%. Bybit’s Margin Staked SOL redefines earning opportunities on SOL. With the potential to grow SOL holdings by leveraged borrowing and staking, Bybit users stand to significantly enhance on-chain rewards through bbSOL. The platform is designed for a hassle-free experience, allowing for easy borrowing, staking, and earning all in one place. This streamlined approach eliminates the complexities often associated with managing multiple accounts or services. Additionally, users are afforded the flexibility to redeem bbSOL for SOL at any time in two ways—they may opt for Instant Redemption where users can receive their SOL immediately with no gas fee, or for Postponed Redemption for a better exchange rate compared to instant redemption without the gas fee waiver. Both redemption mechanisms ensure user control over their assets and allow them to adapt their strategies as needed. How Bybit’s Margin Staked SOL Works: Staking SOL: Users may stake SOL into Margin Staked SOL, enabling the system to automatically borrow funds based on the selected leverage.

With the ability to leverage up to a healthy level of 2x, users can now tap into the demonstrable yield potential of bbSOL, potentially unlocking greater earning opportunities. As of Mar. 17, 2025, the net APR of Bybit Margin Staked SOL on Bybit stood at over 13%. Bybit’s Margin Staked SOL redefines earning opportunities on SOL. With the potential to grow SOL holdings by leveraged borrowing and staking, Bybit users stand to significantly enhance on-chain rewards through bbSOL. The platform is designed for a hassle-free experience, allowing for easy borrowing, staking, and earning all in one place. This streamlined approach eliminates the complexities often associated with managing multiple accounts or services. Additionally, users are afforded the flexibility to redeem bbSOL for SOL at any time in two ways—they may opt for Instant Redemption where users can receive their SOL immediately with no gas fee, or for Postponed Redemption for a better exchange rate compared to instant redemption without the gas fee waiver. Both redemption mechanisms ensure user control over their assets and allow them to adapt their strategies as needed. How Bybit’s Margin Staked SOL Works: Staking SOL: Users may stake SOL into Margin Staked SOL, enabling the system to automatically borrow funds based on the selected leverage. Earning bbSOL: In return for staking, users will receive bbSOL, Bybit’s Liquid Staking Token, as proof of the staked SOL. Yield Accrual: Users may lock in to grow their bbSOL through optimal rewards allocation managed by Sanctum’s smart contract.

The exchange made the announcement on Mar.17, citing security issues and the need to fix incomplete tagging on blockchain explorers. According to their official statement, the suspension will allow OKX DEX aggregator to roll out new security measures to prevent further misuse. “Recently, we detected a coordinated effort by Lazarus Group to misuse our DeFi services. At the same time, we’ve noticed an increase in competitive attacks aiming to undermine our work,” OKX stated in its blog post. The exchange added that it consulted regulators before taking this step. We are temporarily pausing our DEX aggregator to address incomplete tagging on blockchain explorers while we also roll out new security features. This is to address the recent coordinated attacks by media along with unsuccessful efforts by Lazarus group to misuse our DeFi… pic.twitter.com/r6oHNIaalT — OKX (@okx) March 17, 2025 While the DEX aggregator is paused, wallet services remain available, though new wallet creation is temporarily restricted in select markets. OKX has already implemented a number of security improvements, such as real-time tracking to stop malicious addresses in its centralized exchange and a hacker address detection system for its web3 DEX aggregator. You might also like: OKX acquires MiFID II license in Europe In order to ensure that the actual DEXs processing trades are identified rather than their aggregator, the platform also stated that it is collaborating with blockchain explorers to rectify incomplete labeling. Despite the temporary suspension, OKX stressed that its web3 service is only a DEX aggregator and not a custodian of user assets. The exchange is further strengthening its security by implementing real-time tracking systems to identify and block hacker addresses. The Lazarus Group has been linked to multiple cyberattacks targeting cryptocurrency platforms, including the Feb. 21 $1.5 billion Bybit hack . In their latest wave of attacks targetting developers, the group has deployed six new malware packages on the Node Package Manager platform to steal credentials and wallet data. The hackers have also been using fake Zoom calls to trick crypto founders into downloading malicious software. Over $1.3 billion worth of cryptocurrency was stolen by North Korean hackers in 47 attacks in 2024, more than doubling the amount stolen the year before, according to Chainalysis.

He has to assure investors that the economy is strong while making it clear that the Federal Reserve is ready to cut interest rates if things start going south. The timing is brutal. Stocks have been unstable, bond yields are down, and the White House isn’t exactly helping. His message has to be precise—too much confidence and markets panic, too little and the sell-off deepens. The Fed is expected to keep interest rates steady when officials meet on March 18-19. But traders are betting on three rate cuts this year, starting in June. Economists are calling for two. If Powell signals only two, he’ll need to stress the Fed’s willingness to act fast if the job market shows signs of cracking. “At the margin, the Fed could make it slightly better or slightly worse,” said James Athey, portfolio manager at Marlborough Investment Management. “But clearly they can’t completely calm markets because the hit to sentiment has come largely from the White House.” Fed faces pressure as markets react to Trump’s economic policies Donald Trump has made things worse. The president’s trade war escalated fast, and the market is feeling it. Stocks have been in a free fall for the past month. Treasury yields are dropping. Consumer sentiment is down. The White House hasn’t stepped in to reassure anyone. Instead, Trump said on March 9 that the economy is in a “period of transition.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent doubled down, saying the markets are in need of a “detox.” None of that helped investors. Market volatility is already affecting Fed decisions. The two-year Treasury yield, which reacts the fastest to monetary policy shifts, has dropped nearly 60 basis points since January. It hit 3.83% this month, the lowest level in over five months. The S&P 500 is down 10% from its peak. The VIX, which measures market fear, hit its highest level since August. That’s the backdrop for Powell this week. He can’t ignore it. “Powell needs to give some sort of a signal that they’re watching it,” said Dominic Konstam, head of macro strategy at Mizuho Securities USA. The Fed doesn’t react to the stock market directly, but it can’t pretend this isn’t happening. Economic projections coming out this week are expected to show slower growth for 2025 and slightly higher core inflation, which removes food and energy costs. That makes the Fed’s job even harder. Inflation makes rate cuts complicated Inflation is still a problem. Consumer prices slowed in February. Producer prices didn’t move at all. But the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which the Fed watches closely, is still firm. Long-term inflation expectations have now climbed for three straight months, hitting a 30-year high. That’s why Powell can’t just promise rate cuts. “We’ll hear the message that things are still holding up and that policy is in a good place,” said Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo. She wants clarity on how the Fed is balancing inflation risks against a slowing economy. Matthew Luzzetti, chief US economist at Deutsche Bank, says the Fed will wait before moving rates. “There’s lots of uncertainty that’s out there,” he said . “They are going to be in a wait-and-see mode.” He doesn’t expect rate cuts this year but acknowledges that the inflation fight isn’t over. If the economy slows while inflation stays high, most economists expect the Fed to keep rates steady. But they’re also watching Trump’s other policies. Tax cuts and deregulation could push growth and inflation even higher, forcing the Fed to rethink its strategy. Powell and other officials are waiting to see the full impact before making a move. “Despite elevated levels of uncertainty, the US economy continues to be in a good place,” Powell said earlier this month in New York. “We do not need to be in a hurry and are well positioned to wait for greater clarity.” Fed’s balance sheet and Trump’s trade war add to uncertainty Investors are also looking for clues about the Fed’s balance sheet. Officials have been reducing it, a process called quantitative tightening (QT). Minutes from the Fed’s January meeting show that they’ve discussed slowing or pausing QT, especially since lawmakers haven’t reached a deal on the debt ceiling. “The argument for March is that the Fed has already talked about it,” said Blake Gwinn, head of US rates strategy at RBC Capital Markets. “So why not just do it? They can pause QT and restart it later.” A Bloomberg News survey shows most economists expect the Fed to keep rates steady through mid-2025, with two cuts in September and December. That’s a shift. Back in December, they expected three cuts starting in March. The change reflects uncertainty around Trump’s trade policies. The president has threatened tariffs against China, Canada, and Mexico. He’s also changed his stance multiple times, making it impossible for markets to price in risk. Investors don’t know what’s coming next, and that’s creating instability. “The Fed is in a very tough spot right now, facing a more stagflationary outlook even as core inflation remains well above its medium-term target,” said Scott Anderson, chief US economist at BMO Capital Markets. “Uncertainty around the magnitude, duration, and targets of future tariffs further complicates the monetary policy outlook.” Most economists don’t expect big changes to the Fed’s post-meeting statement. But some see the possibility of a slowdown in QT. Around 11% predict the Fed will ease up next week. Another 41% think that will happen in the second quarter. Trump’s policies could force the Fed to act sooner Looking ahead, the big question is how the Fed will react if inflation stays high while the economy slows. Nearly three-quarters of economists surveyed said they now expect weaker growth in 2025 due to Trump’s policies. Two-thirds now predict higher inflation. So far, Fed officials haven’t said much about how Trump’s policies will influence their decisions. They remain optimistic about the labor market but acknowledge inflation concerns. “The costs of being cautious are very, very low,” Powell said this month. “The economy’s fine. It doesn’t need us to do anything, really, and so we can wait and we should wait.” Most economists believe the Fed will hold rates steady if inflation remains high while growth slows. But if conditions worsen, some expect cuts to come sooner. “If our downside scenario plays out, the Fed will have to shift to focus on growth risks and could start to cut rates by Q3,” said Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide. She sees the first cut happening in October. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

The wild world of memecoins has delivered another rollercoaster ride, and this time, it’s a dizzying plunge. Just days ago, the crypto sphere was buzzing about a new token, WOLF of Wall St (WOLF), linked to none other than Hayden Davis, the co-creator of the infamous LIBRA project. But the initial excitement quickly turned to dismay as WOLF experienced a shocking memecoin crash , losing a staggering 99% of its value soon after launch. Let’s dive into the details of this dramatic crypto event and explore what it means for the volatile world of digital currencies. What Triggered the WOLF Token Memecoin Crash? According to reports from The Block, citing data from blockchain analytics platform Bubblemaps, the WOLF token saw its market capitalization briefly soar to nearly $43 million after its release on March 8th. However, this peak was incredibly short-lived. Almost immediately after reaching this high, the token began a rapid and relentless descent, resulting in a devastating memecoin crash . The speed and severity of the decline have raised eyebrows and sparked discussions about the nature of memecoin investments and the potential risks involved. Here’s a breakdown of the key events: Launch Date: March 8th Token Name: WOLF of Wall St (WOLF) Alleged Creator: Hayden Davis (LIBRA co-creator) Peak Market Cap (Briefly): Nearly $43 million Subsequent Plunge: 99% Data Source: Bubblemaps While the exact reasons behind the memecoin crash are still under scrutiny, typical factors contributing to such dramatic price drops in the memecoin market include: Pump-and-Dump Schemes: Memecoins, often driven by hype and social media buzz, are susceptible to pump-and-dump schemes. Early investors create artificial demand (the “pump”), attracting later investors, before selling off their holdings and causing a price collapse (the “dump”). Lack of Fundamental Value: Unlike established cryptocurrencies with underlying technology or use cases, memecoins often lack intrinsic value. Their price is primarily driven by speculation and community sentiment. High Volatility: The memecoin market is known for extreme volatility. Prices can surge and plummet rapidly, making them incredibly risky investments. Rug Pulls: In some cases, memecoin projects can be outright scams where developers abandon the project after raising funds, leaving investors with worthless tokens. Hayden Davis and the Shadow of a Crypto Scandal The involvement of Hayden Davis, known as a LIBRA co-creator , adds another layer of intrigue to this crypto scandal . LIBRA, the token purportedly linked to Argentine President Javier Milei, has already been a subject of controversy. Adding fuel to the fire, Argentine lawyer Gregorio Dalbon had previously requested an Interpol Red Notice against Davis. While the details surrounding this request are not explicitly linked to the WOLF token incident, it certainly casts a shadow over Davis’s involvement in the crypto space. Is this crypto scandal simply another case of memecoin volatility, or are there deeper issues at play? The connection to a figure like Hayden Davis, already facing legal scrutiny, raises questions about the legitimacy and intentions behind the WOLF token project. Investors are left wondering if this was an inevitable outcome or a deliberately orchestrated scheme. WOLF Token: A Cautionary Tale in the Memecoin Frenzy The dramatic memecoin crash of the WOLF token serves as a stark reminder of the risks associated with investing in highly speculative digital assets. While the allure of quick gains in the memecoin market is strong, the potential for significant losses is equally real. Here are some key takeaways from this event: Due Diligence is Crucial: Thorough research is essential before investing in any cryptocurrency, especially memecoins. Understand the project, its team (if known), and the underlying risks. Manage Risk Wisely: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Memecoins should be considered high-risk, high-reward investments, and portfolio allocation should reflect this. Be Wary of Hype: Memecoin prices are often driven by social media hype and influencer endorsements. Don’t let FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) cloud your judgment. Understand Tokenomics: Examine the token distribution, supply, and other tokenomics aspects. Look for red flags like a large percentage of tokens held by a small number of wallets. Consider Project Legitimacy: Assess the project’s legitimacy. Are the developers transparent? Is there a clear roadmap or purpose beyond hype? In the case of WOLF, the alleged creator’s background and prior controversies should have raised immediate concerns. The WOLF token collapse is not an isolated incident. The history of memecoins is littered with similar stories of rapid ascents followed by catastrophic falls. While some memecoins have provided early investors with substantial returns, many more have left investors holding worthless tokens. Navigating the Volatile Crypto Market The crypto market volatility is a double-edged sword. It presents opportunities for significant gains but also carries substantial risks. For those venturing into the world of memecoins, it’s crucial to approach with extreme caution and a clear understanding of the potential downsides. The WOLF token saga highlights the importance of informed decision-making and risk management in the fast-paced and often unpredictable cryptocurrency landscape. Here are some actionable insights for navigating crypto market volatility , particularly in the memecoin space: Actionable Insight Description Diversify Your Portfolio Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, especially not a memecoin basket. Spread your investments across different asset classes and cryptocurrency types. Set Realistic Expectations Understand that memecoin investments are highly speculative. Don’t expect to get rich quick, and be prepared for potential losses. Use Stop-Loss Orders Implement stop-loss orders to limit potential losses. This automatically sells your tokens if the price drops to a predetermined level. Stay Informed Keep up-to-date with crypto news and market trends. Be aware of potential scams and red flags. Consider Long-Term Investing If you’re risk-averse, focus on established cryptocurrencies with strong fundamentals and long-term growth potential rather than chasing memecoin hype. Conclusion: Lessons from the WOLF Token Debacle The WOLF token collapse serves as a dramatic and timely lesson in the perils of memecoin mania. The alleged involvement of LIBRA co-creator Hayden Davis and the swift 99% memecoin crash underscore the inherent risks in this speculative corner of the crypto market. While the dream of overnight riches may be tempting, the reality is that memecoin investments are fraught with danger. Investors must exercise extreme caution, conduct thorough due diligence, and manage risk responsibly to avoid becoming victims of the next crypto scandal or memecoin crash . The WOLF token’s fleeting moment in the spotlight is a powerful reminder: in the crypto world, what goes up fast can come down even faster.

The central bank cited Bitcoin’s high volatility as a major concern, warning that “transaction costs to cash out Bitcoins could rise drastically” if the crypto market experiences instability. Officials also pointed out that Bitcoin does not meet the International Monetary Fund’s criteria for foreign exchange reserves, which require assets to maintain liquidity, market stability, and a credit rating of investment grade or higher. Discussions around national crypto reserves have gained traction globally, especially following the U.S. government’s decision to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . Some countries, like Brazil and the Czech Republic , have even expressed openness to the idea. Yet, the Bank of Korea maintained that a “cautious approach” is necessary, noting that institutions like the European Central Bank, the Swiss National Bank, and Japan’s financial authorities share a similarly skeptical stance. The bank further clarified that it has neither reviewed nor formally discussed the possibility of incorporating Bitcoin into its reserves.

As previously reported by crypto.news, the Financial Services Commission has also taken a similar stance. In November, FSC Chairman Kim Byung-hwan acknowledged calls for a national Bitcoin reserve but dismissed the idea as premature However, South Korea has been gradually loosening its stance on crypto regulations. The country’s financial watchdog has been working on lifting restrictions on institutional crypto trading and is preparing a second legal framework focused on stablecoin oversight. Policymakers are also considering allowing crypto exchange-traded funds, which, according to the chairman of the Korea Exchange, could bring fresh opportunities to the country’s financial sector.

Reports suggest that President Donald Trump’s team is eyeing XRP as a key player in building a powerhouse Bitcoin (BTC) reserve. A new proposal submitted to the US SEC suggests that XRP could play a key role in boosting the US financial system. The plan claims that integrating XRP could unlock $1.5 trillion in liquidity, which could then be used to buy Bitcoin. However, this idea faces major regulatory hurdles, and it remains unclear if the government will take it seriously. How XRP Could Free Up Trapped Funds The five page proposal written by Maximilian Staudinger suggests that the US should consider using XRP to free up capital stuck in Nostro accounts. These accounts, used for cross-border transactions, hold about $27 trillion globally, with around $5 trillion belonging to US banks. By using XRP, Staudinger believes that $1.5 trillion could be released and redirected toward Bitcoin purchases. Staudinger also proposes a structured crypto reserve system for the US. He argues that Bitcoin should be at the center, while Solana and Cardano could be used for government applications. However, he insists that XRP is the most important asset for handling financial transactions. Bold Bitcoin Claims Raise Questions One of the more questionable parts of the proposal is the claim that the US could buy 25 million Bitcoin at $60,000 per coin. This is impossible since Bitcoin’s total supply is only 21 million. Still, the proposal argues that using XRP could save the US up to $7.5 billion in transaction fees annually and make government payments, like Social Security and tax refunds, faster and cheaper. Regulatory Challenges Stand in the Way Despite its ambitious plan, the proposal faces a big setback—XRP’s unclear regulatory status. Staudinger urges the SEC to classify XRP as a payment asset instead of a security. He also calls on the Department of Justice to lift restrictions preventing banks from using XRP. To speed things up, he suggests a presidential executive order to bypass regulatory delays. His plan includes two timelines: a standard 24-month rollout with standard regulatory approval, government payments, and bank adoption, or opting for a fast-track 6-12 month timeline using executive orders and Fed mandates for quick XRP integration. While ambitious, the fast-track approach could work given Ripple’s existing global liquidity network. Will This Proposal Go Anywhere? While the idea sounds interesting, independent proposals like this usually don’t gain much traction unless backed by major financial institutions or government officials. Without strong support, this remains a bold idea rather than a plan the US is likely to adopt anytime soon.",News|Crypto Scam,EN,0,0,XRP|BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|FIAT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-17 05:55:31

It feels like just yesterday we were introduced to a promising new layer-1 blockchain, and now, Solana is blowing out five candles! That’s right, Solana is celebrating its fifth anniversary, and the numbers are nothing short of staggering. If you’ve been following the crypto space, you know Solana has been making waves, but the scale of its achievements might still surprise you. Let’s dive into what makes this milestone so remarkable and what it means for the future of this dynamic blockchain. Solana’s Remarkable 5-Year Journey: A Blockchain Revolution Five years in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency is an eternity, and Solana has certainly made the most of it. From its mainnet beta launch in March 2020, Solana has rapidly evolved into a powerhouse in the blockchain landscape. In a recent post on X, Solana highlighted some mind-blowing statistics that underscore its growth and impact: Over 408 Billion Transactions: Yes, you read that right – billion with a ‘B’! This colossal number speaks volumes about the sheer volume of activity happening on the Solana network. It’s a testament to Solana’s high throughput and scalability. More Than 1,300 Validators: A robust and decentralized network needs strong validators, and Solana boasts a community of over 1,300 of them. This decentralized validator set is crucial for network security and resilience. Over $987 Billion in DEX Trading Volume: Approaching the trillion-dollar mark, the decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume on Solana is astronomical. This highlights Solana’s significant role in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. These aren’t just numbers; they represent real-world usage, adoption, and the vibrant ecosystem that has flourished around Solana. And as Solana itself declared, “just getting started,” hinting at even greater things to come. Decoding Solana’s Explosive Transaction Growth: What’s the Secret Sauce? 408 billion transactions – it’s a number that begs the question: how did Solana achieve such phenomenal transaction growth? The answer lies in Solana’s innovative approach to blockchain technology. Unlike some of the earlier blockchains, Solana was designed from the ground up for speed and scalability. Here are some key factors contributing to its impressive transaction processing capabilities: Proof of History (PoH): This is Solana’s groundbreaking innovation. PoH provides a historical record that proves an event occurred at a specific moment in time. It works alongside Proof of Stake (PoS) to drastically increase transaction throughput without compromising security. Think of it as a cryptographic clock that orders transactions, making consensus much faster. High Throughput Architecture: Solana’s architecture is engineered for high performance. It leverages features like Turbine, Gulf Stream, Sea Level, Pipelining, Cloudbreak, and Archivers, all working in concert to optimize transaction processing and network efficiency. Low Transaction Fees: Speed is great, but affordability is equally crucial. Solana is renowned for its incredibly low transaction fees, often a fraction of a cent. This makes it incredibly attractive for users and applications that require frequent transactions, from DeFi trading to micro-payments. To put it into perspective, let’s compare Solana to some other prominent blockchains: Blockchain Transactions Per Second (TPS) (Approximate) Average Transaction Fee (Approximate) Solana Thousands Extremely Low ( Ethereum 15-30 Variable, Can be High ($1 – $10+) Bitcoin 7 Variable, Can be Moderate to High ($1 – $5+) *Note: TPS and fees are approximate and can fluctuate based on network conditions. As you can see, Solana stands out with its high TPS and remarkably low fees, making it a compelling choice for a wide range of applications. The Power of Solana’s Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Trading Volume: A DeFi Hotspot Nearly a trillion dollars in DEX trading volume – that’s a massive figure! It firmly establishes Solana as a major player in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) arena. But what does this DEX volume really signify? It indicates a vibrant and active DeFi ecosystem built on Solana. Here’s why this is significant: Thriving DeFi Applications: High DEX volume is a direct result of numerous successful and popular DeFi applications (DApps) being built on Solana. These include decentralized exchanges like Raydium, Orca, and Serum, lending platforms, yield aggregators, and more. Liquidity and Capital Efficiency: Large DEX volume indicates deep liquidity within the Solana DeFi ecosystem. This is crucial for traders and investors as it allows for efficient and seamless trading of digital assets. Growing User Adoption: Significant DEX activity reflects increasing user adoption of Solana for DeFi activities. People are actively using Solana to swap tokens, participate in yield farming, and engage in various DeFi strategies. Innovation in DeFi: Solana’s technical capabilities enable the development of more sophisticated and innovative DeFi products and services that might be challenging to implement on slower or more expensive blockchains. Solana’s low fees and high speed are particularly beneficial for DeFi, where users often perform multiple transactions. Whether it’s frequent trading, yield optimization strategies, or participating in new DeFi protocols, Solana provides a cost-effective and efficient environment. Solana’s Thriving Ecosystem: Validators and Community at its Heart Beyond the impressive transaction numbers and DEX volume, the strength of any blockchain lies in its community and infrastructure. Solana’s ecosystem is powered by over 1,300 validators, playing a critical role in maintaining the network’s integrity and security. Why are validators so important? Network Security: Validators participate in the consensus mechanism, verifying transactions and adding new blocks to the blockchain. Their collective effort ensures the network remains secure and resistant to attacks. Decentralization: A large and geographically diverse validator set enhances the decentralization of the Solana network. This reduces the risk of censorship and single points of failure. Network Uptime and Reliability: Validators contribute to the continuous operation of the Solana network, ensuring high uptime and reliability for users and applications. Community Governance: Validators often participate in network governance decisions, contributing to the evolution and improvement of the Solana protocol. Furthermore, Solana boasts a vibrant and growing developer and user community. This community is constantly building new applications, contributing to open-source projects, and driving innovation within the Solana ecosystem. The active community is a vital ingredient in Solana’s continued success. Looking Ahead: Solana’s Anniversary and the Future of Blockchain Innovation As Solana celebrates its fifth anniversary, it’s not just about looking back at past achievements but also looking forward to the future. The “just getting started” message is a powerful indicator of Solana’s ambitions. What can we expect from Solana in the coming years? Continued Network Upgrades: Solana is known for its rapid development and continuous network improvements. We can anticipate further optimizations to enhance scalability, security, and functionality. Expansion of the Ecosystem: Expect to see even more diverse and innovative applications being built on Solana, spanning DeFi, NFTs, gaming, and potentially new sectors we haven’t even imagined yet. Mainstream Adoption: Solana’s speed and low fees position it well for mainstream adoption. As blockchain technology becomes more integrated into everyday life, Solana is poised to play a significant role. Addressing Challenges: Like any technology, Solana faces challenges, including network congestion during peak times and the ongoing need to balance decentralization with performance. The Solana team and community are actively working on solutions to these challenges. Solana’s journey over the past five years has been nothing short of explosive. It has demonstrated the potential of high-performance blockchains and has become a key infrastructure layer for the burgeoning decentralized web. With its impressive transaction volume, thriving DeFi ecosystem, and dedicated community, Solana is not just celebrating an anniversary; it’s showcasing a revolution in blockchain technology. Happy 5th Anniversary, Solana! The future of blockchain looks brighter with you in it.

Lara Lea Trump dedicated an entire episode to the future of digital assets, featuring none other than Strategy’s chairman Michael Saylor, President Donald Trump, White House Crypto Czar David Sacks, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Saylor took center stage, sharing how he stumbled upon Bitcoin and how it changed his company’s fate. He later posted , “On Sunday night, Fox News’ hit show My View with Lara Lea Trump was devoted to Bitcoin and digital assets, using the words of Donald Trump, Crypto Czar David Sacks, Treasury Sec Scott Bessent, and yours truly to educate its mainstream audience on the power and promise of this new technology.” Trump’s Bitcoin vision and economic policies take focus The episode opened with Lara addressing the economic wreckage of the past four years—inflation, rising debt, and federal spending. She blamed the Biden-Harris administration for increasing spending by $300 billion in its final months. The national debt now stands at $36 trillion, with high interest rates squeezing businesses and taxpayers alike. Then, Donald Trump’s voice took over. He declared, “We are going to take in hundreds of billions of dollars… become so rich you won’t know where to spend that money.” He promised a Bitcoin-friendly future, calling it “America’s next big industry”. The show highlighted 10,000 manufacturing jobs added in February, and $115 billion cut in wasteful spending. Trump claimed this was just the beginning. “Last year, I promised to make America the Bitcoin superpower of the world,” he said, doubling down on plans to integrate Bitcoin into the national economy. Viewers had questions. A caller from India, Stefan, asked, “What are your hopes for crypto under a second Trump administration?” Lara responded, “My hopes are likely the same as yours—for American prosperity to thrive once again.” She reinforced Trump’s vision, saying America must lead in Bitcoin innovation. Michael Saylor gave the audience a Bitcoin reality check, as he explained in the snippet why it’s the strongest financial asset on the planet and why governments need to take it seriously. “We realized the dollar was inflating, and cash was losing value. Bitcoin is the only asset that holds purchasing power long-term,” said Saylor. A segment of the My View episode featured everyday people reacting to Bitcoin. Many admitted they didn’t understand it, some called it “sketchy”, while others said they were long-term holders waiting for big gains. Lara sent a team to New York City to ask regular people what they thought about crypto. Some were skeptical. Others were already deep in the game. One man summed it up: “I don’t understand Bitcoin, but I know one thing—banks aren’t my friend. If Bitcoin gives me freedom, I’ll take it.” Another said, “I bought crypto years ago, and I’m holding. In ten or twenty years, we’ll see where it goes.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

Last week, markets were rattled by US President Trump’s abrupt tariff announcements, but there was a little reprieve after encouraging inflation data with the CPI report coming in below expectations. However, the Consumer Sentiment Index continued its three-month slide, falling to its lowest level since November 2022 as recession fears mount. “Wednesday marks the second Fed interest rate decision of 2025, at a pivotal point in time,” commented the Kobeissi Letter. Economic Events March 17 to 21 February’s Retail Sales report will be released on Monday, offering insights into the amount of money consumers are spending on both durable and non-durable goods. This data is a leading indicator of the economy’s overall health and inflationary factors on the demand side. There are reports for industrial production showing the volume of production of US industries like manufacturing, mining, utilities, and housing starting figures on Tuesday; however, these have a low impact. All eyes will be on the US central bank on Wednesday as policymakers are widely expected to keep interest rates flat at the policy meeting. Fed officials are reluctant to make any monetary policy moves while they wait to see the effect of Trump’s economic policies. According to the CME Fed Watch tool , there is a 99% chance that rates will remain unchanged at 4.25% to $4.5%. Key Events This Week: 1. February Retail Sales data – Monday 2.

Crypto Market Outlook Crypto market capitalization has shrunk by a further 3.3% on the day in a fall to $2.8 trillion at the time of writing, with declines accelerating during Monday morning trading in Asia. Bitcoin dipped to $82,000 before recovering slightly to reclaim $83,000 at the time of writing. The asset remains down almost 11% over the past fortnight. Ethereum remains in bear market territory, having fallen below $1,900 again and with very few signs of recovery.

The Department of Justice charged Ver with mail fraud , tax evasion and filing false tax returns in April 2024, alleging he hid the amount of Bitcoin ( BTC ) he owned when he renounced his US citizenship in 2014 and defrauded the Internal Revenue Service out of $48 million by failing to report the gains he made through selling them. Sharing more re the call to dismiss the prosecution against Roger Ver @PamBondi @elonmusk @realDonaldTrump @Davewarrington https://t.co/BckQwEXBW6 — marla maples (@itsmarlamaples) March 16, 2025 Maples and Trump met in the mid-1980s during his first marriage to Ivana Trump, and was his second wife from 1993 until 1999. She has long been involved with philanthropy and has advocated for multiple charities and causes. She is seemingly still close to and supportive of Trump, who together have a daughter, Tiffany Trump. Maples attended Trump’s inauguration and told the London Evening Standard in July that she was “open to whatever way that I can serve” the then-presidential bidder. Maples joins a host of high-profile figures calling to stop the prosecution of Ver, which includes Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and online black market Silk Road creator Ross Ulbricht, who was facing a double life sentence in prison until Trump pardoned him in January. Ver has appealed to Trump for a pardon, claiming he is being unfairly persecuted and is a victim of “lawfare.” Neither Trump nor the White House has publicly acknowledged Ver’s plea, but Trump’s cost-cutting czar Musk said in a January X post that Ver “gave up his US citizenship. No pardon for Ver. Membership has its privileges.” Related: Roger Ver’s Trump pardon plea: ‘Lawfare’ victim or tax evader? Ver was arrested in Spain at the time of the US indictment pending his extradition to the US but was later granted bail on the condition he remain in the country. He moved to dismiss the government’s case in December, arguing the charges were unconstitutional, and the IRS’ “exit tax” for renounced citizens is “inscrutably vague” when applied to crypto.

South Korea's Central Bank Rejects Bitcoin Reserves, Citing Volatility In response to a written question from a member of the National Assembly Strategy and Finance Committee, the Central Bank announced that it does not consider Bitcoin as a reserve asset. The central bank stressed that the significant transaction costs associated with converting Bitcoin into cash could pose a risk to financial stability. Additionally, the South Korean central bank referred to the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) guidelines on foreign exchange reserve management, which emphasize prudent control of liquidity, market and credit risks. Discussions regarding national Bitcoin reserves gained momentum after US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on March 6 to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve using BTC seized from criminal and civil cases. While Trump’s move has led many countries to explore the idea of holding Bitcoin reserves, South Korea remains skeptical. The central bank’s position aligns with Japan, Switzerland and the European Central Bank, which have all been wary of accepting Bitcoin as part of their foreign exchange reserves. Despite rejecting Bitcoin as a reserve asset, South Korea is taking steps to ease strict crypto regulations. The country’s financial authorities are gradually lifting restrictions on institutional crypto trading and are currently preparing a second legal framework focused on stablecoin regulation. As South Korea balances crypto market growth with regulatory oversight, debate over Bitcoin’s role in national reserves is likely to continue. *This is not investment advice.

In a stunning turn of events, North Korea has reportedly ascended to the ranks of a major Bitcoin holder, securing the third-largest government position globally. Yes, you read that right. While nations worldwide grapple with crypto regulation and adoption, it appears North Korea has been quietly amassing a significant digital fortune. Let’s dive into the details of this surprising development and explore what it means for the future of cryptocurrency and global geopolitics. Shocking North Korea Bitcoin Holdings Revealed According to a recent report by Bitcoin.com, leveraging data from the esteemed Arkham Intelligence, North Korea now holds the third-largest stash of Bitcoin among governments worldwide. This revelation is based on the identified holdings of the Lazarus Group, a notorious hacking collective with ties to North Korea. Arkham Intelligence’s meticulous on-chain analysis pinpoints the Lazarus Group as possessing a staggering 13,562 BTC. This places North Korea ahead of nations like Bhutan and El Salvador in the government Bitcoin holdings race, painting a fascinating, if not slightly concerning, picture of global crypto distribution. But how does this compare to other nations? Let’s take a look at the top players in the government Bitcoin holding arena: Rank Government Bitcoin Holdings (BTC) 1 United States 198,109 2 United Kingdom 61,245 3 North Korea 13,562 4 Bhutan 10,635 5 El Salvador 6,117 As you can see, the United States and the United Kingdom dwarf other nations in their Bitcoin reserves. However, North Korea’s position at number three is undeniably noteworthy, especially considering the nation’s isolated economic and political standing on the global stage. This data underscores the diverse and sometimes unexpected ways in which Bitcoin is being adopted and utilized by different entities around the world. Decoding Government Bitcoin Holdings: Why North Korea? The question that naturally arises is: why is North Korea accumulating Bitcoin, and how did they amass such a significant amount? The answer, according to the report, lies with the Lazarus Group. This hacking collective, infamous for its cybercriminal activities, is believed to be responsible for numerous high-profile crypto heists, including the recent breach of the crypto exchange Bybit. It’s suspected that the Bitcoin held by North Korea is largely derived from these illicit activities. This raises several critical points about the nature of government Bitcoin holdings and the methods of acquisition: Sanctions Evasion: North Korea faces stringent international sanctions due to its nuclear weapons program. Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, offer a potential avenue to bypass these sanctions and access the global financial system. Funding State Operations: The funds obtained through cybercrime and cryptocurrency holdings could be used to finance various state operations, including military programs and government initiatives. Decentralized Finance Advantage: Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and relative anonymity make it an attractive tool for nations seeking to operate outside the traditional financial framework. Economic Strategy: In a nation with limited access to international trade and finance, Bitcoin could be viewed as a strategic asset and a store of value, albeit a volatile one. Lazarus Group Crypto Activities and Bybit Breach The Lazarus Group’s role in North Korea’s Bitcoin adoption strategy cannot be overstated. This sophisticated hacking organization has been linked to numerous cyberattacks targeting financial institutions and cryptocurrency exchanges globally. Their modus operandi often involves sophisticated phishing campaigns, malware deployment, and exploiting vulnerabilities in exchange security systems. The recent breach of Bybit, a prominent crypto exchange, further highlights Lazarus Group’s ongoing and impactful operations within the crypto sphere. The implications of Lazarus Group’s activities are far-reaching: Increased Scrutiny on Crypto Exchanges: Incidents like the Bybit breach underscore the need for robust security measures and enhanced vigilance within the cryptocurrency exchange ecosystem. Geopolitical Cybersecurity Concerns: State-sponsored cybercrime, particularly for financial gain, raises significant geopolitical cybersecurity concerns and necessitates international cooperation to combat these threats. Reputational Risks for Crypto: The association of cryptocurrency with illicit activities, such as those attributed to Lazarus Group, can negatively impact the overall perception and mainstream adoption of crypto assets. The Broader Picture: Bitcoin Adoption and Crypto Regulation North Korea’s emergence as a significant Bitcoin holder is just one facet of the evolving global crypto landscape. Across the world, governments are grappling with how to regulate, manage, and potentially leverage cryptocurrencies. While some nations, like El Salvador, have embraced Bitcoin as legal tender, others remain cautious, citing concerns about volatility, money laundering, and illicit financing. The situation with North Korea adds another layer of complexity to the ongoing discussions around crypto regulation : Regulatory Challenges: How can international regulatory bodies effectively address the use of cryptocurrency by sanctioned nations and cybercriminal organizations? Transparency and Traceability: Enhancing the transparency and traceability of cryptocurrency transactions is crucial to deter illicit activities, but also raises privacy concerns. International Cooperation: Combating crypto-related crime and illicit financing requires robust international cooperation and information sharing between governments and law enforcement agencies. Innovation vs. Security: Striking a balance between fostering innovation in the crypto space and ensuring security and regulatory compliance remains a key challenge for policymakers worldwide. Navigating the Future of Crypto and Global Finance The revelation of North Korea’s substantial Bitcoin holdings serves as a stark reminder of the multifaceted nature of cryptocurrency and its growing influence on the global stage. It highlights both the potential benefits and inherent risks associated with decentralized digital currencies. As governments and institutions continue to navigate the complexities of crypto regulation and adoption, the case of North Korea underscores the urgent need for international dialogue, enhanced cybersecurity measures, and a balanced approach that fosters innovation while mitigating risks. The crypto world is constantly evolving, and stories like this one demonstrate just how dynamic and unpredictable it can be.

Bloomberg reported on March 11 that the EU regulators were investigating OKX’s Web3 services for allegedly laundering funds from the Bybit hack, prompting OKX President Hong Fang and other executives to call Bloomberg's report misleading and assert the company's commitment to combating financial crime. ""We are addressing a tagging issue with explorers that highlights OKX DEX aggregator as the destination of trades when in fact, OKX DEX aggregator just looks for the best price to execute the order, and then the final order/trade is placed on one of the DEXs our aggregator connects to,"" a spokesperson for OKX told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. The spokesperson said that after consulting regulators, they proactively paused our DEX aggregator to implement new tagging and security upgrades.
