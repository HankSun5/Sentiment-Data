But with Sui-based ETFs gaining traction, another project on the Binance Smart Chain is making waves for its unconventional model and early-stage community incentives. The King of Pigs ($KOPS) , a meme token initiative, is heading to the market with its ICO launch. Many experts suggest it’s time to throw the focus on the memecoin market after knowing the dynamics of KOPS. The development team has taken initiatives to take the purpose of the token to the next level. KOPS ICO, Community Building, and Open Airdrop The KOPS team has confirmed that the project remains in its pre-launch stage, with preparations already underway for its eventual future initial coin offering. Although a date has not yet been scheduled, the team is already busy building its online community. According to their roadmap, the objective is to onboard 10,000 community members, known internally as “warriors.” At the same time, a surprise airdrop has been launched for early participants. This initiative remains open, and according to the project’s communication, early contributors still have a chance to claim profits. The $500k mega airdrop is currently live and is available for early believers to enter he pigdom. Features Behind $KOPS Ecosystem Like any other memecoin , the $KOPS community encourages humour and purpose at the same time. While it delivers entertainment and viral content, a portion of its revenue is dedicated to supporting animal welfare causes. By strategically leveraging meme culture through contests, influencer collaborations, and viral challenges, $KOPS is positioning itself as a powerful and lasting force in the crypto space. In addition to this, token holders can also participate in project governance by voting on proposals that determine the future of the platform. The KOPS team also announced that a portion of each transaction fee is donated to animal welfare charities. This aspect adds a cause-based element to the memecoin’s utility, adding social impact to its ecosystem. BSC Infrastructure and Social Campaigns KOPS token is developed on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), which is an infrastructure that facilitates zero fees on trading and quick transaction processing. The infrastructure also supports interoperability with other BSC-based applications, making usability widespread. To promote visibility, KOPS is also running multiple community events. As announced in an official X post, the team is launching a ‘UGC CONTEST’ featuring a prize pool of 85,000,000 $KOPS. This initiative is part of a larger strategy to drive organic growth by promoting user-generated content. With a strict anti-spam and anti-bot policy in place, the project ensures genuine community engagement. https://twitter.com/TheKingofPigs_/status/1922229570440462628 To get more details about the UGC contest, you need to become a part of the Telegram community , where you can get the topic. If you are a creative mind with a unique skill of storytelling, the one entry you make here could be your life-changing step. The contest would happen for 30 days. So, hurry up and make your entries there as per the instructions provided by the $KOPS development team . The team announced that their tokenomics model is designed to achieve a balance between long-term utility and user incentives. With a high total supply, the system fosters active participation based on fairness, transparency, and sustainability. By incorporating gamified features, on-chain governance, and charity elements, KOPS aims to position itself as a purpose-driven, community-driven memecoin. As Sui’s attention persists with institutional ETF filings, KOPS is providing a differing approach centered on engagement, blockchain integration, and early-stage incentives. The Premium Update The KOPS team is entering the market with a bang, and it’s time for you to grab the golden opportunity. The ICO event is going to happen, and it’s time for investors and traders to keep their wallets funded.

As attention focuses on ETH, a new opportunity is unfolding. Unilabs, an AI-powered crypto asset manager, has launched four innovative funds and is making waves across DeFi with its live presale and growing traction in the market. Unilabs Quietly Builds While Markets Watch ETH Unilabs is not just another token; it is the first AI-backed digital asset manager with over $30 million in assets under management (AUM). Its goal is simple: remove human error and emotional bias from crypto investing by using artificial intelligence to manage diversified crypto portfolios. Think of it like a decentralized BlackRock, offering curated investment baskets designed by machine-learning algorithms instead of human fund managers. These baskets are segmented across four major funds: the AI Fund, BTC Fund, RWA Fund, and Mining Fund. Each fund is operated by real-time AI models that constantly rebalance based on market volatility, risk appetite, and sector performance. Unilabs’ AI doesn’t just track charts; it evaluates memecoin spikes, real-world asset (RWA) trends, and DeFi innovations simultaneously, enabling investors to tap into high-performance segments of the market. Presale Heats Up: 8,000 Join Unilabs As the Ethereum price surges, Unilabs is experiencing its own quiet boom. Over 8,000 new investors have already joined the presale, which offers UNIL tokens at discounted tiers before they hit public exchanges. Currently in early access, the presale enables users to purchase UNIL at below-market rates, with added incentives for staking and referrals. Over 20% of Unilabs tokens in Stage 2 have been sold, raising more than $300K. At the current price of $0.0051, buyers can secure a 21.5% ROI before the next stage increase to $0.0062, without even waiting for market listing. With 80 million $UNI already allocated, this is shaping up to be the best presale for early investors seeking discounted entry and high upside potential, especially ahead of possible price surges on DEX or CEX listings. UNIL is both a utility and governance token. Investors can stake it to earn passive income with variable ROI while also participating in fund governance and decision-making. Ethereum Price Surges: But Where Is the Smart Capital Going? The Ethereum price has taken off by a whopping 44% over the last six days, spiking from $1,800 to $2,600, primarily because of Abraxas Capital’s dramatic buying of ETH in huge amounts. The London-based investment firm acquired between $399 million and $695 million in ETH. Lookonchain data confirms massive exchange withdrawals that historically coincide with sharp price spikes. This institutional action didn’t just move ETH; it signaled growing confidence in digital assets from major capital pools. Source : CoinMarketCap While the Ethereum price rally captivated headlines, data reveals increased volatility in DeFi markets, potentially opening doors for algorithm-driven platforms like Unilabs. Unlike ETH, which requires individual investor decisions or staking in separate protocols, Unilabs offers consolidated fund exposure, where AI reallocates capital dynamically. As Ethereum price movements become increasingly influenced by institutional actors, platforms like Unilabs allow retail investors to ride the wave using hedge-fund-grade logic without needing insider access. Conclusion While the Ethereum price continues to rise on the back of institutional interest like Abraxas Capital’s $477M buy, Unilabs offers a rare ground-floor opportunity. With four powerful funds, $30M in managed assets, and over 8,000 new users onboarded during the presale, this is not just another project; it’s an ecosystem designed for long-term, intelligent growth. The presale is live, and pricing tiers are climbing with each new milestone. Investors are looking for more than hype. Those seeking structured portfolios, AI-driven returns, and passive staking income are already moving in. History has shown that those who get in early, whether with ETH, Solana, or Dogecoin, benefit the most. Unilabs is writing its own chapter now. The only question is, will you be part of it?

The Future New Orders diffusion index leapt by forty-plus points, a move that Julien Bittel, head of macro research at Global Macro Investor (GMI), called “literally” historic. Crypto Bulls Can Rejoice Bittel’s commentary on X framed the print with statistical precision: “Philly Fed data for May dropped yesterday – and the Future New Orders index just made history. Literally. … Expectations for new orders posted the largest monthly spike ever recorded – going all the way back to the index’s inception in May 1968. A staggering +4.3 standard deviation move. He underlined the shock with a comparison few macro watchers will forget: For perspective: that’s an even bigger move up than the downside collapse during the depths of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis (-4.1σ). Let that sink in…” Bittel then set the surge in a broader narrative that has animated his research since late last year. “Q1 growth was weak. The reason is straightforward – financial conditions tightened sharply in Q4. The dollar ripped, bond yields surged… a classic tightening phase,” he wrote. Related Reading: Analysis: Crypto Heats Up As $35 Billion Enters Market In Under A Month The proximate trigger, in his telling, was “businesses panic‑loading inventories ahead of Trump tariffs, and markets front‑running the inflation narrative.” Those dynamics, he argued, are a replay of Donald Trump’s first term: “We’ve highlighted repeatedly: this had all the hallmarks of Q4 2016 during Trump’s first term. Just like early 2017, that tightening spilled over into slower growth momentum in Q1.” Where 2017 began with doubt and ended in a synchronous global boom, Bittel believes 2025 is rhyming. “Those Q1 headwinds have flipped into Q2 tailwinds,” he insisted. “Everything flows downstream from changes in financial conditions… Purchasing managers’ expectations are shifting – and shifts in thinking eventually translate into action. Sentiment shifts first. Action follows. It always does. Bullish.” The crypto market responded muted. Bitcoin reclaimed the $104,000 level in early‑European trade, but lost it later on. Ether steadied near $2,600, and high‑beta layer‑one tokens such as Solana and Avalanche moved in tandem. Related Reading: Ethereum Gains Momentum Amid Flat Funding Rates – Is This A Healthy Uptrend? Giancarlo Cudrig, head of markets at Immutable, said the scale of the shock is less important than how under‑positioned investors are for an upside growth surprise. “An upside economic shock like this – +4.3σ on new orders – is rare. But the bigger story is market positioning. Asset prices are not prepared. The melt‑up is the asymmetric risk. Now it’s being repriced.” Independent analyst Market Heretic struck a similar note on X: “When this dropped, markets didn’t even blink. Because the shift’s already in motion. This wasn’t news, it was confirmation. That’s the real tell, when markets shrug off a four‑sigma upside shock. It means the turn is already upon us – and it’s just getting started.” For crypto investors, the implications are immediate. A softer dollar and retreating real‑yield expectations reduce the opportunity cost of holding non‑yielding assets, while the early phase of a reflationary turn historically favours high‑beta exposures. Bittel’s own playbook is unambiguous: “Sentiment shifts first. Action follows.” As long as that chain reaction continues, the crypto bulls appear to have both math and momentum on their side. At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $3.28 trillion.

These meme coins transformed modest investments into life-changing returns during previous market cycles. Now, in mid- 2025 , retail attention is swinging back toward the meme sector—and a new question is emerging: can MAGACOINFINANCE deliver a similar story? While SHIBA and DOGE remain influential, cracks are forming. SHIBA has faced setbacks following the departure of its key developer, Shytoshi Kusama , while DOGE is riding renewed optimism tied to stable prices, community growth, and potential celebrity endorsements. Still, seasoned meme coin holders are now eyeing earlier-stage plays like MAGACOINFINANCE for outsized return potential. SMART MONEY IS LOADING UP – ACT NOW SHIBA and DOGE: Veteran Players Prepare for a Second Wind SHIBA currently trades at $0.00002 with a market cap of around $12.9 billion , maintaining strong exchange volume (~$445 million daily). Despite developer exits and internal headwinds, SHIBA remains anchored in meme coin consciousness, bolstered by persistent community engagement and speculation-driven buyers. DOGE , meanwhile, has surprised many in 2025. With prices ranging between $0.15 and $0.20 , DOGE is eyeing a climb toward upper resistance around $0.29 to $0.41 . Its strength lies in its branding, widespread exchange access, and continued cultural relevance—fueled in part by figures like Elon Musk and Tesla references. It may lack formal roadmaps, but DOGE thrives on momentum. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT MAGACOINFINANCE Emerges as the Early-Stage Challenger In a meme coin cycle where timing is everything, MAGACOINFINANCE stands out—not for what it is today, but what it could become. Like DOGE in 2014 and SHIBA in 2020 , it offers early adopters exposure at the point where the biggest moves historically begin. Its combination of political meme culture and strong branding has caught the eye of crypto influencers, Telegram traders, and speculative buyers familiar with meme-driven trajectories. It hasn’t hit mainstream listings yet—but behind the scenes, its community is growing fast. On-Chain Signals Suggest Institutional Curiosity Blockchain activity is showing early signs of traction. Wallet analysis highlights the emergence of larger holder addresses, with accumulation by speculators and tracking from several whale-watching communities. Meanwhile, MAGACOINFINANCE is seeing increased mentions across meme-themed forums, further supporting its quiet momentum buildup. While it’s too early to predict long-term performance, the alignment of investor sentiment, cultural timing, and low entry pricing makes MAGACOINFINANCE a clear contender in the current meme rotation wave. LIMITED TIME OFFER-GET 50% EXTRA BONUS WITH MAGA50X Conclusion: Meme Coins Are Back—But the Playbook Has Changed As we enter summer 2025, meme coin enthusiasm is returning. But the landscape has evolved. SHIBA and DOGE remain favorites for those seeking nostalgia and relative stability. MAGACOINFINANCE , by contrast, is drawing the risk-tolerant crowd—those hunting for outsized upside at the start of a narrative. For those who made fortunes in the last cycle, the question isn’t whether meme coins will run—it’s which one will run first. MAGACOINFINANCE may just be that coin.

DOGE has shown long-term resilience. SHIBA offers potential upside with volatility. MAGACOINFINANCE is earlier-stage, carrying more risk—but possibly higher reward. Q: Can SHIBA reach a new all-time high in 2025? Analysts say yes—especially if retail interest surges. Targets near $0.00008 are possible under strong market conditions.

According to the university’s ongoing Surveys of Consumers, the Index of Consumer Sentiment dropped to 50.8 this month, the second-lowest rating ever recorded. The lowest rating ever recorded was 50 in June 2022. The survey began in November 1952. Said Surveys of Consumers Director Joanne Hsu, “Consumer sentiment was essentially unchanged this month, inching down a scant 1.4 index points following four consecutive months of steep declines. Sentiment is now down almost 30% since January 2025. Slight increases in sentiment this month for independents were offset by a 7% decline among Republicans.” The survey also finds that consumer assessments of personal finances fell by 10%, anticipating weaker incomes and a weaker economy ahead. “Tariffs were spontaneously mentioned by nearly three-quarters of consumers, up from almost 60% in April; uncertainty over trade policy continues to dominate consumers’ thinking about the economy.” With Trump’s tariff wars creating uncertainty, the University of Michigan survey finds that inflation expectations are experiencing a bipartisan surge. “Year-ahead inflation expectations surged from 6.5% last month to 7.3% this month. This month’s rise was seen among Democrats and Republicans alike. Long-run inflation expectations lifted from 4.4% in April to 4.6% in May, reflecting a particularly large monthly jump among Republicans.” Source: University of Michigan Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The MUSD stablecoin, backed by cash and U.S. Treasuries, and running on the eCash blockchain, is designed to help Tinian diversify its economy. The stablecoin legislation also authorizes internet casino licensing, strategically linking blockchain technology with tourism and online gaming. Tinian, a small island in the U.S. Pacific territory of the Northern Mariana Islands, jolted U.S. crypto policy by becoming the first public entity in the United States to receive approval to launch a USD-backed stablecoin. The move follows a successful vote by the Northern Mariana Islands House of Representatives to override a veto from the territory’s governor. The new legislation allows the Municipality of Tinian and Aguiguan to issue the “Tinian Stable Token,” formally named the Marianas US Dollar (MUSD). In a historic vote that will have a profound impact on the entire #crypto industry and my home, The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the House of Representatives voted to overturn a Governor's veto to allow the 1st US government-issued stablecoin to be issued here! pic.twitter.com/BOWjTyZXTV — Cyprian (Vin Armani) (@cyprianous) May 15, 2025 The stablecoin will be backed by cash and U.S. Treasury bills held in reserve by the Tinian Municipal Treasury, and launched on the eCash blockchain, a Bitcoin Cash ABC fork rebranded in 2021. The bill also authorizes Tinian to issue licenses to internet casinos, tying the digital asset launch to tourism and online gaming. With a population of just over 2,000, Tinian is seeking new revenue streams as its economy struggles. Tinian Overrides Governor’s Veto, Approves Marianas USD Stablecoin On May 9, the territory’s nine-member Senate voted 7-1 to override Governor Arnold Palacios’ veto . Days later, the 20-member House followed with a 14-2 vote, clearing the two-thirds majority needed to push the bill through. Tinian, a small island in the U.S. territory of the Northern Mariana Islands, is one step closer to launching its own stablecoin. #Stablecoin #Tinian https://t.co/U3xVI6Ax82 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 12, 2025 Governor Palacios vetoed the bill in April, citing legal concerns and a lack of enforcement measures to prevent illegal gambling. In a letter, he warned that the legislation may be unconstitutional and that its scope couldn’t be limited strictly to Tinian. Supporters of the bill argue the move could bring in much-needed revenue without burdening the government. “We need this legislation to unlock our potential,” said Republican Representative Patrick San Nicolas, a member of the Tinian delegation. “This bill does not depend on tourists or federal subsidies—it builds a digital industry generating revenue from a licensed jurisdiction.” The Tinian government has partnered with Marianas Rai Corporation as its exclusive technology provider for the stablecoin infrastructure. The firm’s co-founder, Vin Armani, urged lawmakers to reverse the veto ahead of the vote, claiming the bill could “attract billions of dollars of investment and tax revenue” to the island. Historic first: The Tinian government in the Northern Marina Islands will become the first-ever U.S. public entity to issue a USD-backed stablecoin — launching it on the eCash network! Chosen for its low fees, scalability, and gasless token design, eCash is powering… https://t.co/yUFULOiQlC pic.twitter.com/jSKV2WLoya — eCash (@eCashOfficial) May 16, 2025 However, not everyone agreed. Independent Representative Marissa Flores expressed concern over the bill’s connection to online gambling. “Every time we talk about casinos, there’s always some kind of bitter pill to swallow,” she said. “It is true, we are in dire need of money, but what I don’t like is when we are desperate… Every time we’re desperate, it always seems that we come back to casinos.” Despite the criticism, the bill passed and is expected to go into effect before July. Governor Palacios maintained his objections, warning that the measure could be unconstitutional and lack proper safeguards. Still, with both chambers of the legislature in favor, Tinian now leads the way as the first U.S. public entity to authorize and prepare to issue its own dollar-backed digital currency. Another State Advances Public Stablecoin Plans Amid Federal Regulatory Gridlock While Tinian leads with the first U.S. public stablecoin on the eCash Network, another state, Wyoming, is moving steadily with its own state-backed initiative. On May 12, the Wyoming Stable Token Commission announced a partnership with Inca Digital Federal LLC to strengthen oversight and security for the Wyoming Stable Token (WYST), expected to launch soon. Wyoming’s first state-issued stablecoin, WYST, will launch with live surveillance tech from Inca Digital. #wyoming #stablecoin https://t.co/UR6QTSzID0 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 14, 2025 WYST will be fully backed by cash, U.S. Treasuries, and repurchase agreements, and is designed to be redeemable 1:1 with the U.S. dollar. The commission is currently testing the token across Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche networks. Meanwhile, at the federal level, stablecoin regulation remains stalled. Legislative efforts like the GENIUS Act and the STABLE Act have lost momentum , largely due to political rifts over Donald Trump’s increasing involvement in crypto ventures.

Moody's announced that the US credit rating was downgraded to Aa1 due to rising budget deficits and rising interest costs. The organization noted that the US government's widening budget deficits are rapidly increasing the need for borrowing, which is putting upward pressure on interest rates in the long run. It also noted that current budget plans being discussed in Congress are not sufficient to reduce the persistent imbalance between spending and revenues. The move follows similar downgrades by Fitch Ratings in 2023 and S&P Global Ratings in 2011. The U.S. loses its highest credit rating from all three major rating agencies. Its new credit rating is Aa1, a level already shared with countries such as Austria and Finland. “Successive U.S. administrations and Congress have failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend of high annual budget deficits and rising interest costs,” Moody's said in a statement. Related News: Why Did the Judge Reject the Settlement in the Ripple-SEC Case? Three Legal Sources Respond The downgrade could add to the pressure on U.S. Treasuries already under pressure from expectations of higher inflation and rising debt, but experts do not expect the downgrade to cause significant market turbulence. Indeed, after the S&P downgrade in 2011, Treasury bonds rose due to the weak economic outlook. The US remains the world's largest economy and a benchmark against which other countries measure their economic reliability. Still, some investors say the latest downgrade could hurt the U.S.'s perception as a global haven of trust, leading global investors to demand higher yields on U.S. bonds. “This could increase the cost of servicing our debt, further widening the budget deficit,” said Michael Goosay, global head of fixed income at Principal Asset Management. *This is not investment advice.

Why Analysts Say 30x Appears Realistic,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/could-magacoinfinance-reach-1-in-2025-why-analysts-say-30x-appears-realistic/,"As the cryptocurrency market gains momentum in 2025, MAGACOINFINANCE is capturing significant attention. With over $8 million raised in its tokenand a current price under $0.001, analysts project a potential return of 18,500%, suggesting that a $1 valuation by year-end might be achievable. This projection is not only driven by strong fundamentals and market positioning but also by the accelerating pace of early stage investor participation , which often precedes the steepest phases of growth in high-performing altcoins. While established cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) continue to solidify their positions—ETH trading around $2,489 and SOL at approximately $172—MAGACOINFINANCE offers a compelling opportunity for exponential growth. Its unique blend of political meme appeal and structured tokenomics sets it apart in a crowded market. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Analyst Insights on MAGACOINFINANCE’s Potential Industry experts highlight several factors contributing to MAGACOINFINANCE’s bullish outlook: Scarcity-Driven Model: A capped supply of 100 billion tokens, with 45% allocated to the presale, creates a scarcity that can drive demand. Community Engagement: A rapidly growing community exceeding 20,000 holders indicates strong grassroots support. Audited Smart Contracts: As audited by HashEx , this ensures transparency and builds investor confidence. These elements, combined with a strategic marketing approach, have led analysts to forecast a conservative 35x return, with some models suggesting the potential for a 50x surge. Historical trends in cryptocurrency indicate that early-stage investments often yield the highest returns. With MAGACOINFINANCE still in its presale phase and a listing price target of $0.007, early investors have the opportunity to capitalize on significant upside potential before broader market adoption. LIMITED TIME OFFER-GET 50% EXTRA BONUS WITH MAGA50X Conclusion MAGACOINFINANCE stands out as a promising altcoin in 2025, offering a blend of strong fundamentals and high growth potential.

Launched five months ago, KEKIUS enjoys a strong community and significant liquidity. Elon Musk changed his X handle to Kekius Maximus again on Friday, May 17, 2025, thus indirectly promoting Ethereum (ETH)-based memecoin KEKIUS. At the tail end of 2024, Musk changed his X handle to Kekius Maximus and used an image of Pepe, a frog dressed in a gladiator costume. As a result, KEKIUS memecoin was born earlier this year on the Ethereum and Solana networks. During the first time that Musk changed his X handle to Kekius Maximus, KEKIUS price surged over 900 percent and surpassed a market cap of $380 million.

The small-cap memecoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $55 million and a 24-hour average traded volume of about $37 million, confirmed a bullish breakout potentially towards its all-time high. Moreover, the Ethereum-based memecoin has received significant attention from speculative crypto traders, currently amounting to over 26k on-chain holders. Additionally, the KEKIUS team has pooled over 452 WETH, currently worth about $1.16 million, to provide liquidity on different DeFi protocols. Most importantly, KEKIUS memecoin has already been listed by top-tier crypto exchanges led by Gate.io, and MEXC, among others. As a result, KEKIUS price is well positioned to rally exponentially in the coming months, especially amid the rising calls for an altseason.",Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-16 22:24:31

And so we think it makes it a lot easier to be exchanged, a lot more accessible for everybody.” Robinhood's Johann Kerbrat at Consensus 2025. Source: Cointelegraph Robinhood has been one of a handful of investment firms or brokerages that have explored RWA tokenization in recent months. Others include BlackRock , Franklin Templeton , Apollo , and VanEck . RWA tokenization is often touted as a means to enhance financial accessibility, with most tokenized funds currently concentrated on the private credit and US treasury markets. According to RWA.xyz on May 16, the total market capitalization of onchain RWA is $22.5 billion across just 101,457 asset holders. On average, each holder owns $221,867 in onchain assets. Related: MultiBank, MAG, Mavryk ink world’s largest $3B RWA tokenization deal Stablecoin evolution will create more ‘specialized’ tokens Kerbrat also touched on stablecoins, which have emerged as a key crypto use case this cycle. “You will see 100 stablecoins,” he predicted. Kerbrat expects a rise in stablecoins that are “more specialized in a specific market.” According to DefiLlama, dollar-pegged stablecoins dominate the stablecoin sector. The two largest, Tether’s USDt ( USDT ) and Circle’s USDC ( USDC ), account for $211.8 billion or 87.1% of the $243.3 billion stablecoin market cap. “If you're trying to move funds from the US to Singapore, maybe you will use a specific stablecoin,” he said. ""The shift is going to go from just stablecoin to platforms that are managing all these stablecoins.” Tether's USDT has seen its market share surge over the past few years.

The latest draft of the bill began circulating this week, and a copy seen by CoinDesk showed language had been adjusted in modest ways to help satisfy Democrats concerned with consumer protection and national security elements. In one addition, the bill insisted the big public companies such as Meta wouldn't be approved as issuers of the tokens, though consumer advocates cautioned that private companies such as Elon Musk's social media site X would be eligible. Hagerty paired his statement with one from Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, the New York Democrat who has also pushed this legislation. Her sentiment carried what may have been a shade less confidence about the outcome, and the two lawmakers have ample reason to put a strong public face on a negotiation that's faced headwinds. “Stablecoins are already playing an important role in the global economy, and it is essential that the U.S. enact legislation that protects consumers, while also enabling responsible innovations,” Gillibrand said in the statement, contending that ""robust consumer protections"" are included in the latest version. “The crafting of this bill has been a true bipartisan effort, and I’m optimistic we can pass it in the coming days.” The Senate has experienced considerable volatility on the bill in the past two weeks, with its recent failure to clear a so-called cloture vote that would have moved it forward into a formal debate. It's headed toward a second vote on Monday in which it needs 60 votes to advance, which would need to include several Democrats. The Senate would then have some time to continue debating the language and possibly make changes before moving on to actually passing the bill . Democrats had been critical of its potential for abuse and for stablecoin involvement from corporate giants, but the biggest stink has been raised around President Donald Trump's own interest in crypto businesses, including World Liberty Financial's stablecoin play. Read More: U.S. Senate's Stablecoin Push Still Alive as Bill May Return to Floor: Sources A previous version of the bill had easily advanced out of the Senate Banking Committee with a bipartisan vote before some of the same Democrats that approved it later raised objections. But the Senate has more crypto-friendly Democrats in this session than the last, when the Senate Banking Committee denied any progress for crypto bills. The House of Representatives is also working on its own version, which would have to be melded with the Senate's before Trump could sign the new standards into law. Representative French Hill, the Republican chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, acknowledged at Consensus 2025 in Toronto that Trump's crypto involvement has added friction to the lawmakers' negotiations.

While Dogecoin enjoys increasing popularity, another project is making waves with a unique blend of blockchain and AI technology. Ruvi AI presents not only an innovative approach to solving real-world challenges but also a promising investment opportunity. What is Ruvi AI? Ruvi AI combines artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain to create tools that help businesses improve operations, make better decisions, and manage data more efficiently. This seamless integration ensures transparency, trust, and security for users across different sectors such as healthcare, logistics, and finance. The project is already moving forward significantly with the release of its Beta platform. This live version gives users the opportunity to explore Ruvi AI’s features and see how the platform can deliver value. Its real-world focus sets it apart, as many blockchain projects remain purely theoretical. Presale success and future growth Ruvi AI’s presale results speak volumes about its popularity and potential. During Phase 1, tokens were offered at $0.01, and this phase sold out within just two weeks of launching. Investors who participated in this phase have already seen their token value rise by 50%, as the price has increased to $0.015 in Phase 2. Looking forward, market analysts predict Ruvi AI tokens could reach $1 shortly after listing on major exchanges. Such growth would represent a 6,500% return for early investors, a figure that has grabbed the attention of those familiar with the cryptocurrency and blockchain landscape. Rewarding investor commitment Ruvi AI goes a step further by introducing a VIP rewards system, which incentivizes participation through bonus tokens. These bonuses are tied to the number of tokens investors own, with different VIP tiers offering distinct levels of benefits. $750 investment (VIP tier 2) An investment of $750 during the presale at $0.015 per token buys 50,000 tokens. This qualifies the investor for VIP Tier 2, which provides a 40% bonus, amounting to an additional 20,000 tokens. The total holding increases to 70,000 tokens. At the token listing price of $0.07, these tokens are worth $4,900, delivering a 553% ROI. If Ruvi AI reaches its projected value of $1, the investment would grow to $70,000, representing a massive 9,233% ROI. $1,500 investment (VIP tier 3) For example, investing $1,500 at the presale price secures 100,000 tokens. This qualifies for VIP Tier 3, offering a 60% bonus and an additional 60,000 tokens, bringing the total to 160,000 tokens. When Ruvi AI lists at $0.07, the tokens would be valued at $11,200, delivering a 1,020% ROI for early investors. If Ruvi AI achieves a price of $1, the investment soars to $160,000, yielding a striking 10,567% ROI. $7,500 investment (VIP tier 5 eligibility) For larger investors, putting in $7,500 during the presale secures 500,000 tokens. With VIP Tier 5, investors earn a 100% bonus, doubling their holdings to 1,000,000 tokens. At a listing price of $0.07, these tokens will be worth $70,000, delivering an 833% ROI. If Ruvi AI reaches the projected valuation of $1, the investment balloons to $1,000,000, representing a 12,233% ROI. These examples emphasize how Ruvi AI balances accessibility with serious rewards for those willing to commit. Leaderboard rewards for contributors Ruvi AI’s leaderboard rewards system offers additional incentives for top investors, further encouraging participation and community engagement. The rewards are structured as follows: Top 10 contributors are awarded 500,000 tokens, worth $35,000 at $0.07 or $500,000 at $1. Top 50 contributors receive 250,000 tokens, valued at $17,500 at $0.07 or $250,000 at $1. Top 100 contributors earn 100,000 tokens, which are worth $7,000 at $0.07 or $100,000 at $1. This rewards structure ensures committed participants are well-compensated for their key role in helping the project grow. A vision for the future Ruvi AI aims to revolutionize industries with AI tools that are both functional and transparent. The Beta platform already showcases the project’s potential, proving its value to businesses worldwide. By addressing real-world problems, Ruvi AI stands out from other blockchain projects, which often struggle to deliver tangible results. Opportunity knocks with Ruvi AI With a current token price of $0.015 in Phase 2, Ruvi AI offers an incredible opportunity for early investors. Whether you start with a $750 investment to access VIP Tier 2 benefits or go for a $7,500 investment to unlock VIP Tier 5, the potential for outstanding growth is hard to ignore.

Chainlink helped shape SEC guidance, introducing “unified golden records” and compliance. SEC’s update permits transfer agents to use blockchain for secure, compliant recordkeeping. The SEC released new guidelines on May 15 that might encourage institutions to invest in digital assets. This change details the existing securities laws that apply to broker-dealers and transfer agents in the crypto sector. Such changes mirror a move to larger crypto adoption within the traditional financial industry, mainly for compliance and record management. SEC’s new FAQ discusses key questions on how current regulations treat cryptocurrencies. Hester Peirce said the guidance is just “incremental” and more thorough updates will be released later.

According to the analyst behind this forecast, XRP’s recent price behavior is not a sign of weakness but rather a period of strategic consolidation that is building momentum for the next major surge. Consolidation Phase To Fuel XRP Price Explosion Master Ananda, a crypto analyst on TradingView, released a detailed analysis of XRP on May 15. The analysis highlights the cryptocurrency’s current price action and predicts its next bullish move. Starting with its historical price behavior, the analysis highlights a strong rally that took place in 2024, particularly around November and December, when XRP printed long green candles that indicated strong momentum. Related Reading: Analyst Says XRP Must Hold This Level For Bullish Continuation To $4.2 After reaching a high, XRP entered a consolidation phase, during which price action formed a pattern resembling a symmetrical triangle or wedge. This is marked with red dashed lines on the chart, showing indecision in the market as the price was suppressed. Master Ananda revealed that after this triangle formation, XRP broke out around April 7, 2025 — a date now marked as a potential inflection point in the cryptocurrency’s market cycle. Since then, weekly candles have consistently closed in the green, indicating renewed bullish momentum. Adding to Master Ananda’s bullish case for the XRP price is a Fibonacci retracement and extension levels drawn from the previous major swing high to the recent low. These levels help identify potential resistance and target zones for the next leg up. Notably, the retracement levels have been marked around $2.05 (0.236 Fib), $2.39 (0.382 Fib), and $2.71 (0.618 Fib), culminating at the previous high of $3.40. Fibonacci extension project potential targets are at $4.50 (1.618 Fib), and the highest level is at $6.29 (2.618 Fib). Currently, the trajectory of the curved green arrow in the chart shows a more probable price target of around $5.9. However, XRP will still have to surge past the aforementioned retracement levels and the resistance at $4.5 to reach this level. The overall takeaway of this analysis is that XRP is printing strong bullish signals, and its current consolidation is seen as a precursor to further growth. The asset Approaches Make Or Break Zone XRP is entering a decisive phase, as crypto analyst Egrag Crypto predicts an imminent breakout from a tight consolidation range, within which the cryptocurrency has been trading for months. The analyst’s chart shows a purple zone, which he described as a “pandora box.” This zone represents a critical price range acting as both resistance and support, effectively trapping price action. Related Reading: XRP Price Surge To $10: Analyst Reveals Factors That Will Make It Happen In 2025 Egrag Crypto emphasizes that a breakout above or below this boxed range could ignite high volatility and significant momentum for XRP.

Bittensor (TAO), Render Token (RNDR), and NEAR Protocol (NEAR) are gaining attention for their technical innovations and rising market appeal. But a new name, BlockDAG, is quickly joining the conversation among the top crypto performers this year. With a low presale entry of just $0.0020, an official launch price of $0.05, and early momentum that includes over 20.5 billion tokens sold, BlockDAG is capturing serious investor interest. Unlike meme-fueled hype coins, BDAG offers real utility, a completed CertiK audit, and an EVM-compatible Layer 1 architecture ready for immediate adoption. In this article, we’ll explore why BlockDAG is earning its spot alongside TAO, RNDR, and NEAR, and why it could be one of the top crypto performers to watch right now. $250M+ Raised! BlockDAG Is The Hottest Crypto Buy Right Now BlockDAG is quickly positioning itself as one of the top crypto performers of 2025, and the numbers prove it. The project is currently in Batch 28, where the official price is set at $0.0262. But for a limited time, early adopters can still buy BDAG at just $0.0020, a price that delivers a projected 2,520% return based on its confirmed $0.05 launch value. To date, BlockDAG has sold over 20.5 billion coins, showing strong early demand. But this isn’t just a presale story. BlockDAG is built as an EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain, which means developers can instantly deploy Ethereum-based dApps on its network without extra code or adaptation. This future-ready design makes it practical and usable from day one. BlockDAG has already announced partnerships with five major exchanges, with another fifteen to be revealed on June 13, completing a 20-exchange rollout strategy before public trading begins. The project has also passed a CertiK audit, providing additional trust and transparency for buyers. Over 17,000 miners have been sold, adding to its ecosystem traction. With technical innovation, proven demand, and a presale price that won’t last much longer, BlockDAG is making a solid case as one of the top crypto performers of the year. Bittensor (TAO): AI Utility Meets Long-Term Vision Bittensor is trading at around $421.93 and has held firm despite short-term volatility. Analysts believe TAO could surge to $599.27 by mid-May and possibly reach as high as $2,119.06 this year. TAO’s edge lies in its AI-driven decentralized infrastructure, allowing data and models to be monetized directly on the blockchain. While TAO’s fundamentals are strong, its high price point may be a barrier for some investors. Still, with a projected average price of $1,283.54 in 2025, TAO remains one of the top crypto performers for those bullish on AI integration within blockchain networks. Render Token (RNDR): Decentralized Computing on the Rise Currently priced around $4.80, Render Token is building a decentralized GPU rendering network that’s gaining traction with creatives and developers. Despite recent price dips, projections show RNDR could reach $9.64 by year-end, offering a potential ROI of over 41%. As demand for GPU resources grows, especially for AI and 3D rendering tasks, RNDR’s value proposition becomes clearer. With consistent technical updates and ecosystem partnerships, Render is a solid candidate among 2025’s top crypto performers. NEAR Protocol (NEAR): Smart Contract Evolution and Fast Finality NEAR Protocol is trading at approximately $2.86 after a recent upgrade that introduced global contract support and 600ms block times. These enhancements support real-time AI and high-performance DeFi apps, positioning NEAR as a strong infrastructure choice. With price forecasts ranging from $3.70 in the short term to $20–$30 by year-end if ETF approvals go through, NEAR is gaining serious traction. Its robust roadmap and technical execution help secure its position among the top crypto performers of the year. Watch These Cryptos The 2025 crypto landscape is filled with strong contenders. Bittensor leverages AI infrastructure, Render serves the GPU-hungry creator economy, and NEAR is speeding toward smart contract dominance. All are worthy of recognition as top crypto performers. But BlockDAG stands out for its timing, utility, and explosive growth potential. With a $0.0020 entry, over 20.5 billion coins sold, and exchange listings set to scale, it offers something the others can’t: early access to what could become a dominant Layer 1 player. Its EVM compatibility, CertiK certification, and real hardware demand through miner sales add layers of credibility. As June 13 approaches and 15 more exchanges are revealed, momentum will only build. For those seeking a high-upside, early-stage opportunity among top crypto performers , BlockDAG may be the token everyone’s talking about next, and $0.0020 could soon be a distant memory.

While giants like Ethereum (ETH) , Avalanche (AVAX) , and Cardano (ADA) continue to hold strong, a growing number of investors are rotating into promising altcoins — and MAGACOINFINANCE is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about names in the space. Ethereum (ETH): Still Dominant but Facing Competition Ethereum remains the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, valued at around $291 billion . It maintains a strong lead over altcoins like XRP, AVAX, and Cardano, thanks to its DeFi, NFT, and Web3 ecosystem. But as ETH consolidates, traders are looking for higher-upside opportunities elsewhere — setting the stage for a shift into emerging tokens. Avalanche (AVAX): Holding Steady Amid Market Shifts AVAX has rebounded to the $19–$19.85 range, showing resilience as it eyes a potential breakout toward $23 . Despite its solid fundamentals, traders see altcoins like MAGACOINFINANCE as a chance to capture asymmetric gains — especially as AVAX’s growth trajectory slows. Cardano (ADA): Reliable but Seeking New Momentum Cardano is trading near $0.68 , with strong support at $0.66–$0.63 . While ADA remains a favorite among long-term holders, short-term traders are increasingly seeking altcoins with faster upside potential, adding fuel to the rotation into newer players. MAGACOINFINANCE: The Rising Star of the Altcoin Boom Enter MAGACOINFINANCE — a politically themed token that has captured market attention with over $8 million raised in presale and a price under $0.001 . With a $0.007 target listing price and a 25x–36x base ROI , MAGACOINFINANCE is on track to become one of the biggest breakout stories of the year. Early buyers can amplify gains using the MAGA50X bonus code , which delivers a 50% token bonus . Importantly, MAGACOINFINANCE isn’t just riding hype — it’s backed by strong tokenomics, an independent audit, and a viral community that’s rapidly expanding across crypto channels. Analysts are already comparing its setup to past cycle winners that delivered extraordinary returns, fueling even more bullish sentiment. Why Traders Are Flocking In As Ethereum, AVAX, and Cardano consolidate, MAGACOINFINANCE is offering traders something rare in today’s market — a high-conviction early-stage play with explosive upside potential . With three presale stages still open, the project remains one of the last big opportunities before mainstream momentum hits.

The result is a market narrative worth watching closely. Enter Qubetics ($TICS) and BNB, two distinct players shaping the future of blockchain—one through breakthrough infrastructure, the other through ecosystem dominance and liquidity scale. As community-led sentiment and protocol usage expand, focus is turning toward platforms offering real utility and measurable potential. While Qubetics emerges as a developer-centric project poised to redefine how decentralized applications are created and deployed, BNB continues reinforcing its position as a foundational asset with a current market cap of $91.57 billion and 140.89 million tokens in circulation. It’s not simply about momentum—it’s about architecture, execution, and staying power. At the same time, BNB’s entrenched value across DeFi, NFT platforms, and validator infrastructure keeps it relevant and in demand, especially as the BNB Price Prediction 2030 crosses into new territory. BNB: $91.57B Market Cap and $655.76 Price Reinforce Strength in Ecosystem Use With a live price of $655.76 and a circulating supply of 140.89 million tokens, BNB isn’t just holding its ground—it’s defining the standard for utility-focused digital assets. As the primary fuel of the BNB Chain, BNB facilitates millions of transactions daily, from powering smart contracts and executing low-fee payments to driving validator rewards and liquidity mining in decentralized finance. The $91.57 billion market cap positions BNB as a cornerstone in blockchain ecosystems. This isn’t built on temporary momentum. It’s rooted in strong fundamentals, including an aggressive coin burn model that has systematically reduced supply, elevating scarcity and demand. These built-in deflationary mechanics signal a long-term trajectory of growth aligned with expanding utility. Market Sentiments and Expert Analysis Technical indicators further support this sentiment. The 50-day and 200-day moving averages are trending upward, suggesting continued bullish momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains within neutral bounds, indicating no immediate signs of overbuying or weakening—just stable, data-backed progression. As the BNB Price Prediction 2030 climbs beyond $800, community participants are closely watching volume shifts and network upgrades. With BNB embedded across NFTs, cross-chain bridges, and DeFi protocols, its relevance in upcoming Web3 infrastructure remains indisputable. Qubetics ($TICS): 34th Stage, $0.2532 Token, and Practical Solutions for Developers Qubetics ($TICS) introduces more than a token—it brings a new coding standard through its QubeQode system, offering a visual, modular, and secure environment that eliminates the bulk of legacy issues in smart contract development. Designed to drastically reduce error rates and boost deployment speeds, QubeQode rewrites how smart contracts are built and tested. In particular, the Qubetics IDE is gaining traction for its streamlined UI and pre-coded libraries, making it easier to roll out contracts across DeFi, logistics, gaming, and asset tokenization—all with fewer failure points. Setting up a DeFi protocol in hours, not weeks. Imagine tokenizing agricultural output or manufacturing supply chains using ready-made modules and safe execution layers. Qubetics makes that possible—and it does it in a language developers understand natively. Its intuitive IDE and secure runtime simplify debugging and deployment, reducing common errors that typically slow down product releases. Currently in its 34th presale stage, Qubetics ($TICS) is priced at $0.2532. With over $17 million raised and more than 512 million tokens sold, community members are eyeing projections showing a potential 3,848% ROI at $10 post-mainnet. That kind of stat isn’t thrown around lightly—it signals belief in utility, execution, and scalability. Conclusion: Looking Toward 2030 with Strategic Confidence As blockchain enters its next chapter, it’s becoming increasingly clear that utility will outlast trend cycles. Qubetics ($TICS) is showing the kind of early-stage momentum that isn’t just exciting—it’s measurable. With over $17 million raised, and projections as high as 5,823% ROI at $15, early participation isn’t just about potential—it’s about aligning with innovation. Meanwhile, BNB continues to prove its durability through consistent price support, integration depth, and adoption metrics. The BNB Price Prediction 2030, climbing past the $800 line, is more than optimism—it’s rooted in active developer usage and technical stability. For community members evaluating their 2030 crypto portfolio, balancing established names like BNB with rising ecosystems like Qubetics ($TICS) provides not just diversification but strategic depth, and one of the top crypto presale . Stay tuned, stay prepared—and always build on data, not just dialogue.

44713457,https://timestabloid.com/?p=67424,1747438200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Best Meme Coins to Buy Today: Troller Cat Soars with Over 4k% ROI as XRP’s Potential 50% Crash Hurts Brett and Official Trump,https://timestabloid.com/best-meme-coins-to-buy-today-troller-cat-soars-with-over-4k/,"Have you ever imagined trolling your way to financial freedom just by playing games? With the rise of meme coins and Play-to-Earn platforms, that idea isn’t as far-fetched as it sounds. While XRP’s recent inverse cup-and-handle pattern sets off alarm bells, signals a potential 50% price crash, and tests the $2 neckline support, some meme coins are boldly swimming upstream. XRP’s NUPL entering the denial phase only confirms what seasoned traders already fear: we might be headed for a severe correction. But amid the red sea of pullbacks, coins like Brett and Official Trump show surprising strength. Brett is trying to rebound after hitting a three-month high, and Trump’s token surged 70% thanks to a VIP dinner event that brought meme hype back into the headlines. Yet, even with all this action, one cat is stealing the show—and not quietly. Enter Troller Cat , the internet’s new feline overlord, purring through presale milestones like it owns the place. Over the past few years, meme coins have gone from internet jokes to literal million-dollar moonshots. Dogecoin barked into mainstream headlines, and Shiba Inu pulled off one of the greatest underdog stories in crypto history. You can see fresh contenders like Brett, Trump, and Troller Cat trying to write the next chapter. But here’s the twist: Troller Cat isn’t just riding the meme wave—it’s building a whole Game Center empire during presale. With more than $125,000 raised in just 14 days and over 600 early joiners, it’s not just hype—it’s a serious movement. Troller Cat ($TCAT): Stage 5 Is Live With 4,453% ROI—Still Early Enough to Buy In The Troller Cat presale launched on May 2, 2025, with a starting price of just $0.00000500. Ten days later, Stage 5 is officially live, and $TCAT is now selling for $0.00001166—a 133.2% gain since day one. But the real action is still ahead. With a confirmed listing price of $0.0005309, investors getting in during Stage 5 are looking at a potential 4,453.17% ROI. That’s not a typo. If you buy TCAT now, you’re still incredibly early in one of the most talked-about meme launches of the month. Over $125,000 has been raised in 14 days, and more than 600 early buyers have jumped on board. This one checks every box for anyone scanning the market for the best meme coins to buy today. 26 Stages, Real Utility, and a Ton of Meme Power The Troller Cat presale is structured across 26 themed stages—each inspired by legendary internet trolls. Every stage pushes the price higher, rewarding early believers. Built on Ethereum, fully audited, and KYC-verified, $TCAT combines internet culture with serious tokenomics. Even better? You can stake your $TCAT during the presale and earn 69% APY. Staking begins immediately, with rewards unlocking two months after launch. That means you’re not just holding—you’re earning before the token even hits the open market. Referral Engine That Pays Troller Cat’s viral growth isn’t an accident. It’s baked in. Anyone who invests $25 or more gets a custom referral code. Share it, and both you and your invitee earn 10% bonus $TCAT. It’s a win-win; over 600 buyers have already used it to grow their stacks. For influencers, meme lords, and crypto degens, this isn’t just a fun coin—it’s a marketing machine. So if you’re asking yourself what the best meme coins to buy today are, this might be the most promising candidate. And with Stage 5 only just beginning, it’s not too late to buy TCAT before the price climbs again. Brett: Penguin Power or Just Hype in Disguise? Brett isn’t just some throwaway meme token—it’s a cultural statement born from the Based and Red-Pilled crowd. Brett has built serious traction with ties to the $BASE chain and a community that memes harder than your uncle on Facebook. The coin nearly doubled in price in under two months, breaking out past a stubborn $0.091 resistance level that had held since February. But here’s where things get real. After tagging that multi-month high, Brett took a 20% nosedive, currently hovering around $0.0728. Some call it a healthy pullback, while others fear it’s the beginning of a deeper correction. The $0.0585 support level is the big one to watch—if it bounces from there, Brett could skyrocket to $0.124 or even $0.159, setting up for a fresh leg in the bull cycle. Still, volatility is Brett’s middle name. This ain’t your grandma’s blue-chip—it’s a high-stakes meme ride that’s got traders in Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico glued to their charts. With the Brett army flooding Twitter and Telegram, there’s no shortage of hype. But the question remains: does Brett have a long-term roadmap, or is it just another meme coin surfing on sentiment? Official Trump: Meme Coin or Political Power Play? Unlike Trump, few names bring the internet to a halt, and his cryptocurrency is no exception. Official Trump went nuclear after dropping a game-changing promo: a VIP dinner with Donald Trump at his swanky National Golf Club. Only the top 25 wallets get a seat at the table—and that one move caused the coin to spike 70%, dragging it out of meme coin irrelevance. Now trading around $0.01 with a massive $2.58 billion market cap, Official Trump is turning heads again. But hold up—this coin once traded at a staggering $74 ATH. The current price is barely scratching the surface of its old glory. And while daily volume has exploded to $838 million, the big question is whether this surge sticks once the dinner plates are cleared after May 22. Trump’s vocal support for crypto—pro-Bitcoin, pro-ETF, even floating the idea of a U.S. crypto reserve—is helping keep the coin relevant. It’s political, edgy, and polarizing enough to stay in headlines. But there’s no real utility under the hood—no staking, no ecosystem, no use case beyond vibes and VIP tickets. So sure, TrumpCoin might be one of the best meme coins to buy today—if you’re looking for fast flips and political memes. But if you’re hunting long-term upside, APY rewards, and early-stage ROI up to 4453.17%, then $TCAT is the more brilliant troll to back. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, Troller Cat is more than another fluffy internet coin. While XRP flirts with a scary 50% crash and forms an inverse cup-and-handle pattern that could sink it to $1.24, meme coins are once again stealing the spotlight. Brett might bounce back if it holds key support. Official Trump may continue riding political momentum after May 22. But neither matches the explosive potential of the Troller Cat presale. With 4453.17% ROI on the horizon, $125K raised in two weeks, and 69% APY staking during presale, Troller Cat isn’t just trolling—it’s setting the stage for generational wealth. From its tiny entry point of $0.000005 in Stage 1 to its listing price of $0.0005309, this cat’s got nine lives and a moon mission. Don’t sit on the sidelines while others stack gains. The train’s leaving the station—either you’re on it or chasing it. Wanna see how far a cat can climb? Visit TrollerCat.com and find out. Just remember—early birds catch the catnip.

Troller Cat’s presale offers a low entry price, high ROI potential, and a 69% APY staking program, making it an attractive option for investors. How does Brett’s price movement affect its investment potential? Brett’s recent pullback presents a potential buying opportunity, with key support and resistance levels indicating possible price rebounds. What are the implications of Official Trump’s gala dinner for $TRUMP holders? The gala dinner has increased interest in $TRUMP, but it also raises concerns about political influence and investment ethics. Is Troller Cat’s staking program sustainable? Yes, the 69% APY is designed to reward long-term holders and is supported by the token’s deflationary mechanisms and community engagement strategies. How can I participate in Troller Cat’s presale? Interested investors can join the presale through Troller Cat’s official website, with a minimum purchase of $25 when using a referral code.

With strong fundamentals, technical strength, and surging community interest, these coins are fast becoming must-watch plays for traders and investors. XRP: Riding Legal Wins and Institutional Demand After Ripple’s own legal battle against the U.S. in a ruling victory, XRP has captured many headlines. SEC. XRP Trading Above $2.21 Sees Whale Accumulation. According to data from Santiment, XRP whale accumulation has reached extreme levels. Moreover, large whale holders now control over 12% of the cryptocurrency’s circulating supply. Analysts are looking at price targets of $3, $4.85, and perhaps $6.22. XRP’s future is looking good. Although it is a little volatile in the short term, it may likely reach Ethereum’s market cap if it runs at the current pace for a couple of weeks. Kaspa (KAS): Underrated Gem With BlockDAG Innovation Kaspa is gaining recognition as one of the top proof-of-work networks in the market. The KAS price forecast shows strong support around $0.55, and there is resistance near $0.083. Thus, the price is likely to push towards $0.11 later in the year. For Q3 and Q4 monthly prediction remains positive, the high volume of trading is consistent and also a growing developer ecosystem. Analysts keep an eye on Kaspa as a potential dark horse in the next bull cycle. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Solana (SOL): Technical Powerhouse on the Rise Solana is making a comeback, currently trading at $169.43, after easing from the April dip to $115. The technical indicators are suggesting that buyers are in control. It has an RSI of 73.70, MACD crossover is bullish, and the price action is above the 100-day and 200-day EMAs. Experts in the industry are aimed at a target price range of $180–$200 in the short term and can even rise to $350–$370 in the long term, should momentum and ecosystem growth continue. MAGACOINFINANCE: The Breakout Contender HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW While the majors hold attention, MAGACOINFINANCE is turning heads as one of the most explosive early-stage plays on the market. With over $8 million raised in presale, a price under $0.001 , and a $0.007 target listing price , MAGACOINFINANCE offers an eye-catching 25x–36x ROI potential . Early buyers using the MAGA50X bonus code receive an additional 50% token bonus , amplifying upside. Analysts point to MAGACOIN’s scarcity-driven model, independent audit, and surging community as signs it could become a breakout star in the next altcoin cycle. As the crypto market prepares for its next wave, XRP, Kaspa, Solana, and MAGACOINFINANCE stand out as key contenders to lead the charge. Together, they reflect the perfect mix of established strength and emerging opportunity — making them top picks for the next altcoin cycle.

Infrastructure-focused assets like KASPA , SUI , and XRP continue building on solid foundations—but capital is shifting. Meme coins, fueled by cultural sentiment and political virality, are driving exponential rallies. The meme cycle is no longer just noise—it’s attracting serious capital. While KASPA’s technical roadmap and DAG architecture keep it in high regard, and SUI continues its remarkable comeback, traders are increasingly rotating into tokens like MAGACOINFINANCE , drawn by its blend of political commentary and meme energy. THE CLOCK IS TICKING FAST – ACT NO W Technical Titans: KASPA, SUI, and XRP Hold Their Ground—for Now KASPA currently trades near $0.10 , with a market cap of roughly $2.7 billion . Backed by a unique blockDAG structure and a loyal developer community, KASPA has improved transaction speeds and scalability post-fork. Still, in this cycle, fundamentals alone aren’t always enough. SUI remains fundamentally strong, now valued over $8 billion , buoyed by consistent user growth and high-speed Layer-1 innovation. Price projections suggest a move toward $8.3–$9.0 by June—but volatility persists. XRP , one of the longest-standing giants, continues to average around $2.4–$2.5 with over $3.7 billion in daily volume. Though it enjoys deep liquidity and institutional interest, price growth remains tied to regulatory developments and macro adoption triggers. MAGACOINFINANCE: Quietly Rewriting the Meme Coin Playbook Amid meme favorites like DOGE , PEPE , and TRUMP , MAGACOINFINANCE is carving out a different path. It blends political branding with meme appeal—resulting in growing traction among retail traders and early-stage allocators seeking rotation trades. While it hasn’t reached billion-dollar daily volume yet, MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining ground through a focused pre-sale phase. Its narrative-driven approach resonates with those seeking more than speculative hype—this coin is building a community centered around culture and identity. Early Momentum and Accumulation Indicators Though still in development, MAGACOINFINANCE is generating key early signals: Community Growth : Social engagement is up significantly, with Discord and Beacon activity rising over the past two weeks Retail Inflow : Wallet analysis shows increasing accumulation from TRUMP and DOGE investors Narrative Alignment : Influencers within the meme sector have begun covering MAGACOINFINANCE’s positioning While its market cap lags behind SUI or XRP, early acquisition of MAGACOINFINANCE mimics the early movements seen in PEPE and TRUMP before their explosive growth. Can Fundamentals Compete With the Meme Trade in 2025? The truth is: fundamentals and memes are now clashing more directly than ever. KASPA offers true innovation and developer commitment. SUI has liquidity depth and speed. XRP remains a regulated, institutional bet. But meme coins are winning attention—and fast. MAGACOINFINANCE may not be the most technically robust token, but its cultural resonance and early-stage nature could turn it into the breakout of summer. With a limited token supply and a community-first approach, it plays into 2025’s rotating narrative economy where sentiment drives price as much as code. LIMITED TIME OFFER-GET 50% EXTRA BONUS WITH MAGA50X Conclusion: The Rotation Is Real—and MAGACOINFINANCE Is on the Radar As this market cycle matures, capital is flowing toward tokens with momentum, not just technology. KASPA, SUI, and XRP will remain relevant—but MAGACOINFINANCE represents the other side of the market: fast-moving, meme-aligned, and potentially explosive. With growing volume, rising attention, and a politically infused brand, this altcoin may be poised for a short-term surge—before its listing hits full throttle. To learn more about MAGACOINFINANCE , please visit Website: https://magacoinfinance.com Twitter/X: https://x.com/magacoinfinance FAQs What is MAGACOINFINANCE and how does it compare to major coins like SUI or XRP? MAGACOINFINANCE is a meme-driven token rooted in political culture. Unlike Layer-1 chains like SUI or settlement networks like XRP, it gains traction through narrative appeal rather than infrastructure use. Is XRP still affected by regulatory risk? Yes. While Ripple has gained clarity in some regions, global regulatory pressures remain a variable, and institutional demand is tied to long-term compliance.

The agency says that since April, malicious actors have sent text messages and artificial intelligence (AI)-generated voice messages that appear to be from senior US officials. The scheme targets individuals who are mostly current or former senior US federal or state government officials and their contacts. “If you receive a message claiming to be from a senior US official, do not assume it is authentic.” The perpetrators use techniques known as smishing and vishing to carry out spear phishing, a form of phishing attack where bad actors send personalized messages to specific individuals or groups. Smishing uses short message service (SMS) or multimedia message service (MMS) text messaging, while vishing uses phone calls or voice messages and may incorporate AI-generated voices. The FBI says that the fraudsters aim to establish rapport and gain access to personal accounts. They can do this by sending malicious links to their victims under the pretense of switching to a separate messaging platform. The agency says that contact information collected through social engineering schemes may be used to impersonate contacts to harvest information or obtain funds. “Access to personal or official accounts operated by US officials could be used to target other government officials, or their associates and contacts, by using trusted contact information they obtain.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Gold, Analyst Sees ‘Higher Than Expected’ Returns",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-strengthens-vs-gold-analyst-sees-higher-than-expected-returns/,"Bitcoin’s price may surge above $200,000 next year, according to recent analysis by X account Apsk32. He warns that the familiar four‑year cycle for BTC often lines up with fresh highs. Short swings have hit traders hard before. This time, bulls say Bitcoin could even top $250,000 in 2025. Related Reading: XRP Frenzy Builds: Over $1 Billion in Open Interest Signals Breakout Tension Bitcoin Gold Link According to Apsk32, Bitcoin often trails gold by a few months. Gold hit a record $3,500 per ounce earlier this year. If Bitcoin follows that path, it could surge. He measures Bitcoin’s market value in ounces of gold instead of dollars. That way, money printing and inflation don’t skew the view. Power Curve Model Apsk32 uses what he calls a “power curve” tool. It fits Bitcoin’s market cap in gold ounces to a smooth curve. The tool stretches back to the 2017 high near $20,000. When plotted, it suggests a 2025 bull‑market peak above $200,000. He told X followers that “if Bitcoin’s position relative to gold keeps improving, returns could top expectations.” Bitcoin’s position relative to gold has improved considerably since April. This is the indicator that gives me hope for higher than expected returns later this year. BTC-USD is close to extreme greed, which sounds scary, but it’s also where we would expect to be if Bitcoin… pic.twitter.com/CY1Qxy4Hdi — apsk32 (@apsk32) May 16, 2025 Realistic Price Targets While some models push for $444,000 this year—what Apsk32 credits to “five years ahead of support”—he thinks a more realistic goal is $220,000. He added there’s a “decent chance” BTC hits $250,000, but he doesn’t see that as the most likely outcome. The $220,000 level would still mark a 10× jump from Bitcoin’s low near $22,000 in late 2022. Gold Market Scenarios Other market experts ran a different test. They looked at how much Bitcoin could be worth if it claimed part of gold’s total value. If gold reaches, say, $5,000 per ounce by 2030 and Bitcoin grabs half of gold’s market cap, BTC could hit a price of more than $920k. But then, these figures are scenario‑based, not firm predictions. Supply And Demand Factors Bitcoin’s supply is capped at 21 million coins. Every block halving makes new BTC rarer. These events come roughly every four years. The next one is expected in 2024. After that, miner rewards fall from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block. Scarcity has driven prices up in past cycles. But demand could shift if big investors pull back. Related Reading: Analysis: Crypto Heats Up As $35 Billion Enters Market In Under A Month Risks And Opportunities Volatility in both gold and Bitcoin could upend these models. Gold can face sudden drops when traders take profits. Bitcoin has swung 20% or more in a single day before. Regulatory moves, geo‑political events, and tech upgrades all play a part. Still, setting clear price scenarios helps investors plan.

This issue temporarily allowed a limited number of customer accounts to be viewable by another customer during online banking… Our team quickly detected and resolved the matter, temporarily disabling some online functions until everything was fixed.

Arvest Bank is offering credit monitoring and identity theft recovery services to affected customers. The bank also says customers who are very concerned about becoming a victim of fraud or identity theft can place a security freeze on their credit files at no cost by contacting any of the three major nationwide credit reporting companies – Equifax, Experian or TransUnion.

According to the May 16 report, the measures include priority access to police emergency lines, home security assessments, and safety briefings from French law enforcement to ensure best practices are being followed. France’s Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau introduced the security measures as part of a broader effort to counter the recent wave of attacks. ""These repeated kidnappings of professionals in the crypto sector will be fought with specific tools, both immediate and short-term, to prevent, dissuade and hinder in order to protect the industry.” Law enforcement officers will also undergo ""anti-crypto asset laundering training,” Retailleau noted. Retailleau met with several local leaders from the crypto industry to discuss the measures following three crypto-related kidnapping incidents in recent months. Two kidnappings and a failed attempt in France this year The latest incident occurred on May 13, when assailants attempted to abduct the daughter and grandson of Pierre Noizat, CEO of the French crypto platform Paymium. Fortunately, they managed to fend off the attack, which occurred in broad daylight. The assailants tried to force the pair into a waiting van, but Noizat’s daughter managed to take one of the guns off an assailant and throw it away, local police said.

He was held captive until a police operation on the night of Jan. 22 secured his release. Retailleau said earlier this week that he believes the incidents were likely connected. There have been over 150 crypto-related robbery or kidnapping incidents since 2014, with 23 of those incidents occurring in 2025 alone, according to a GitHub database maintained by Bitcoin cypherpunk Jameson Lopp. Lopp noted many of these criminals typically identify future victims through social media posts, public conversations, meetups, and conferences. He strongly advises against peer-to-peer trades — particularly with people you don’t trust — flaunting wealth on social media and wearing crypto-branded clothing.

With analysts forecasting potential 25x gains , the momentum shift toward MAGACOINFINANCE is drawing serious attention across trading circles. XRP and Shiba Inu: Profits Recycled Into Fresh Opportunities XRP has been one of 2025’s most resilient performers, bolstered by key legal victories and institutional inflows. Trading above $2.21 , XRP whales have accumulated over 12% of the supply, signaling bullish conviction. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu has seen a revival, climbing 7% in April and benefiting from major token burns and ecosystem upgrades like Shibarium. However, as both XRP and SHIB approach key resistance levels, traders are increasingly looking for new altcoins with asymmetric upside — and MAGACOINFINANCE has emerged as a top destination. MAGACOINFINANCE: A High-Upside Alternative MAGACOINFINANCE has quickly positioned itself as one of the most promising early-stage plays of the year. With over $8 million raised in presale, a price still under $0.001 , and a target listing price of $0.007 , MAGACOIN offers an extraordinary 25x–36x ROI potential . What’s fueling the FOMO? Beyond the price potential, MAGACOINFINANCE has: A scarcity-driven release model that creates continuous demand pressure An independent audit (by HASHEX) that adds credibility and investor trust A viral, politically themed narrative that is dominating crypto conversations Early buyers can also tap into the MAGA50X bonus code , which provides a 50% token bonus — a rare opportunity in today’s crowded altcoin market. Why Traders Are Making the Jump Now For many XRP and Shiba Inu holders, the appeal of MAGACOINFINANCE lies in its early-stage positioning. While blue-chip altcoins are seen as steady holds, MAGACOIN represents a chance to catch the kind of exponential upside typically seen in the earliest phases of past bull markets. Importantly, this isn’t just hype — MAGACOIN’s momentum is backed by strategic execution, community growth, and disciplined tokenomics. Analysts note that coins launched with similar models have historically delivered up to 18,500% gains , adding even more weight to bullish projections. As profits rotate out of mature assets like XRP and SHIB, MAGACOINFINANCE is capturing trader enthusiasm ahead of a potential breakout. For those seeking one of the highest-upside bets in today’s market, the window to act is now — before the next wave hits.

On-chain data suggests the current profit taking is too weak to extinguish Bitcoin’s current price momentum. Bitcoin ( BTC ) price has spent the bulk of the week pinned below $104,000 to $105,000, which many analysts have labelled as a resistance zone, but an alternative view suggests that BTC is simply consolidating within a bull flag. A bull flag is a continuation pattern that is characterized by a period of sideways price action following a sharp uptrend, and when the structure confirms or breaks from the trendline resistance, the uptrend continues. BTC/USDT 1-day chart. Source: TRDR.io While the range-bound trading portion of the flag is said to represent indecision from buyers and sellers, in this scenario, the absence of buy volume is the primary culprit. As shown in the TRDR.io chart below, Bitcoin’s explosive move to $105,900 from $74,400 was accompanied by large liquidations in the margin markets and robust spot volumes, which aligned with several days of billion-dollar spot BTC ETF inflows. BTC/USDT 1hr chart. Source: TRDR.io During this three-week period, several US-based and international companies also announced plans to purchase Bitcoin and establish BTC treasuries . The spot and futures cumulative volume delta, along with the open interest metric on the chart show traders selling near the range highs and the absence of new long leverage and significantly sized spot positions being opened in this area, whereas drops to range low (bull flag support) sees bids filled on the spot side, but there is still limited use of margin for fresh longs. BTC/USD spot and margin CVD. Source: TRDR.io Bitcoin’s recent cool-down phase is a normal outcome after the near 40% recovery that started on April 8, and the loss of upward momentum resulting from profit-taking in futures markets near the current range high is also to be expected. Bitcoin short-term holder supply profit and loss data from Glassnode supports this view, as shown in the chart below. The onchain data company highlighted profit taking for short-term traders but explained that it does not exceed the statistical norm, leaving room for further price upside. “Recently, the magnitude of STH Realized Profit has surged to almost +3 standard deviations above its 90-day average, reflecting a notable uptick in profit realization. In past cycles, particularly during rallies towards the ATH, this metric has historically climbed to over +5 standard deviations of more. This signals that much stronger profit-taking pressure is often required to overwhelm the inflow demand.” BTC: Short-term holder activity in profit and loss.

Bitcoin should test underlying support before moving higher With the bulk of Bitcoin’s apparent sell-side liquidity absorbed during the move to $105,000, some analysts warn that a brief flush down to test $100,000 to $90,000 as support could be the next move for BTC price.

The analyst said that “$90K remains my long-term line in the sand for spot exposure,” adding that he is “cautiously bullish” with price above $90,000 but that is dependent upon how US equity markets perform in the short term. “I would not be surprised to see a short-term flush if stocks were to roll over and make a higher low somewhere. Considering most stocks moved 30% to 50% in a single month, this wouldn’t be that crazy either.” This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Why 2025 Could Be Its Big Rebound Year For ADA and This DeFi Token,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/is-cardano-price-about-to-explode-why-2025-could-be-its-big-rebound-year-for-ada-and-this-defi-token/,"The price of Cardano (ADA) is soaring, and has grown 57% from April lows to $0.8092, arousing emotions in the crypto market. Technical charts provide bullish signals with the implication of 63% jump to $1.3265. Meanwhile there is Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is the rising DeFi star, when it comes to phase 4 presale, it is attracting the crowds, as $8,500,000 has been raised and over 470 million tokens sold to 9,900 holders. With a strengthening of Cardano’s decentralized roots, and with investor ardor being stoked by Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , 2025 stands in the wings for a breakthrough. Both the projects, dynamic and different, are set to reinvent the crypto narrative with daring steps and tall yields. Cardano’s Resilient Climb Cardano (ADA) is showing its muscles as it trades at its maximum since the month of march. The blockchain, a strong competitor of Ethereum and Solana, claims to have increased speed of transactions and strong decentralization. Its recent addition into the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund will show growing institutional trust thereby ranking it in the top list of crypto assets. Yet, challenges linger. Cardano lacks behind competitors with only 42 DeFi apps and $470 million in the total value locked. The next consensus event in Toronto with the founder Charles Hoskinson in tow may end up changing the gears. As a result of his interest in Bitcoin integration through BitcoinOS, staking possibilities may be opened up, and Cardano’s popularity will be increased. Technical patterns such as the inverse head and shoulders indicate the possible rise to $1.79 in the year 2025 but dropping below important trendlines may affect this momentum. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Frenzy Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is stirring the investor desire in its state 4 presale, with 75% filled-up at $0.025 per token. Though beginning from the $0.01 in the opening phase, with the price increase, the price is slowly moving up, and the phase 5 lurks with the 20% jump to $0.03 providing immediate profit for existing buyers. The tokenomics of the project promise a 140% return at the $0.06 list price and analysts’ speculation of a rise of $2.50 post-launch would bring 9900% ROI. Recently, the team put forward a dashboard on which the top 50 holders are demonstrated with bonus tokens given to them for holding their positions against what one may assume to be fierce competition. Security and Transparency Drive Trust Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is focusing on the safety aspect as it works for the smart contract audit with the help of Certik. Social networks will post results within no time hence strengthening the belief in credibility of the platform. Although the sector of DeFi in Cardano is expanding sluggishly, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently useful on account of being an overcollateralized lending platform. The investors can be interested in mtTokens which can grow in a value during the time-passing becoming liquidity and stability. The buy-and-distribute system puts proceeds of the platform towards acquisition of tokens and compensating the stakers and providing for the demands. As phase 4 is about to be over, the calls become loud on the part of the investors to acquire the tokens before the prices rise upward hence the opportune time to embrace the early adopters. A Defining Year Ahead Cardano (ADA) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are on courses for the conquest of the market in 2025. Technical breakout on Cardano and the institutional support show that it is a steady rise with potential prospections of accumulating to $1.79. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) which has experienced a rage in its presale which has sprouted the roofs, and comes with the innovative concept of DeFi is explosive in returns and especially for those who will buy in phase 4. Both of the projects give a picture of the dynamic power of crypto-market which is at the same time a spirit of resilience and an opportunity. Those investors that are searching for the best crypto to buy now have to consider the Mutuum Finance, (MUTM) presale and pay attention to the further moves of Cardano. Move fast, the low-point of entry to phase 4 is not going to last.

Despite a 7% dip over 24 hours, SHIB is still up 25% for the month with a price of $0.0000149 . Analysts predict Shiba Inu could go up 121% to $0.000033 if the stars align. While those numbers are nice, a new project Ruvi is emerging as a serious contender. With its use of blockchain and AI , Ruvi is the project you can’t ignore. Riding on Shiba Inu’s Coattails Shiba Inu has been the trendsetter in capturing investor interest, especially during market rebounds. Over the past month it has shown strength and potential. Whale activity and speculation has built momentum and analysts are charting a bullish path. But while Shiba Inu largely thrives on meme culture and community support , Ruvi is the innovative force blending blockchain and real-world AI applications .

This alignment allows Ruvi to tackle global challenges across healthcare, logistics and finance . Ruvi’s Features: AI Driven Insights Ruvi’s AI brings predictive analytics and automation to blockchain for enterprise and consumer use cases. Deflationary Tokenomics Unlike meme tokens with infinite supply, Ruvi has a total of 5 billion tokens , creating scarcity that drives long term value. Cross Industry Utility Ruvi’s infrastructure is designed to be versatile and support multiple industries for real world adoption. While meme coins like Shiba Inu ride the hype wave, Ruvi is built for sustainable growth through technology. Ruvi’s Presale Ruvi has already shown its potential by completing phase 1 of the presale, raising over $1 million and selling 100 million tokens. With over 1,000 investors on board, Ruvi has now entered phase 2 with tokens priced at $0.015. For smart investors this is a golden opportunity to get in early before Ruvi’s value skyrockets. Ruvi Investment Scenarios Ruvi’s presale bonuses make it impossible to resist for early adopters. Here’s how different investment levels look: Example 1: Entry-Level Investment ($600) Tokens Purchased: $600 / $0.015 = 40,000 tokens Bonus (20%): +8,000 tokens Total Tokens: 48,000 Value at $1: $48,000 Example 2: Mid-Level Investment ($2,000) Tokens Purchased: $2,000 / $0.015 = 133,333 tokens Bonus (60%): +80,000 tokens Total Tokens: 213,333 Value at $2: $426,666 Example 3: High-Level Investment ($12,000) Tokens Purchased: $12,000 / $0.015 = 800,000 tokens Bonus (100%): +800,000 tokens Total Tokens: 1.6 million Value at $3: $4.8 million These examples show why Ruvi’s presale is the most profitable opportunity in crypto right now. Ruvi vs Shiba Inu While Shiba Inu is a cool meme coin with community driven momentum, Ruvi is carving its own niche by focusing on utility and innovation. Ruvi’s AI and real-world applications give it an edge. Shiba Inu rides the speculative wave, Ruvi delivers tangible and scalable solutions for industries worldwide and ensures its longevity and impact. Don’t Miss Out Cryptocurrency markets are defined by their early winners and Ruvi is going to be one of them. With its presale offering such high ROI, this is your chance to be part of a project that doesn’t just ride the hype but creates real change.

Meanwhile, Tether (USDT) is making waves by integrating with LINE NEXT and Kaia blockchain, bringing stablecoins to Asia’s Web3 scene through LINE Messenger. But if you want to see real action, BlockDAG is on another level. Its Buyer Battles are driving 150 million BDAG transactions daily, with big buyers racing to grab unsold coins. Having already raised $251 million and sold 20.5 billion coins, BlockDAG is seeing daily growth that other projects are only promising. With over 170,000 holders, it’s clear that demand isn’t just growing—it’s thriving. SUI Gathers Speed, Eyes $4.20 Breakout SUI’s bullish momentum is picking up speed, now targeting a breakout above $4.20. With $11.7 million in weekly inflows, it’s outpacing Solana and Ethereum, making SUI the top altcoin investment of the year with $84 million in total. On-chain indicators are looking solid too, with RSI nearing 72 and a bullish MACD crossover signaling strong momentum. The price is climbing back through key Fibonacci levels, adding fuel to the fire. To top it off, SUI’s big event in Vietnam on May 17 will spotlight its DeFi, AI, and gaming potential, further boosting investor confidence. Tether Expands in Asia via LINE NEXT Tether is making strategic moves with USDT now integrated into the Kaia blockchain, extending its reach across Asia via LINE NEXT’s Web3 platform. This update allows LINE Messenger users to easily send, receive, and earn USDT directly through Mini Dapps and in-app wallets. By powering Kaia’s DeFi and payment services, Tether is pushing deeper into mainstream usage in the region. This partnership focuses on boosting financial inclusion and simplifying cross-border payments, solidifying Tether’s role in accessible stablecoins. With LINE’s vast user base, USDT adoption in Asia could soar, positioning Tether at the forefront of the region’s Web3 growth. Buyer Battles Drive BlockDAG Presale to $251M! When diving into crypto presales, it can be tough to distinguish real value from all the hype. But with BlockDAG, the chaos is transformed into something clear and exciting. Thanks to its innovative Buyer Battles, every day’s activity is right in front of you. The daily allocation has been bumped up to 150 million BDAG, creating noticeable action in the market. Here’s how it works: each day starts with a set amount of coins up for grabs. If the daily target isn’t hit, the unsold coins go straight to the top buyer of the day. Simple, right? But the results speak volumes. This system keeps buyers coming back, maintaining a steady flow of interest and fueling high demand throughout the presale. And this isn’t just noise. BlockDAG is already showing liquidity levels that most projects only dream of post-launch. With over $251 million raised and 170,000 holders, the presale has been nothing short of a success. In just 28 batches, the price has surged 2520%, jumping from $0.001 to $0.0262. But here’s the kicker: the price will remain at $0.0020 until June 13th before taking off to $0.05 when it officially launches.

Although the leading memecoin has posted impressive gains recently, analysts believe there may still be room for DOGE to climb before reaching a cycle top. Analyst Identifies Signal That May Predict Dogecoin Top According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor burakkemeci, DOGE price tops often align with a surge in retail futures trading activity. The analyst shared the following chart illustrating the relationship between DOGE price peaks and periods of heightened high-frequency futures trading by retail investors. The above chart features red bubbles that mark periods of excessive retail trading activity in the DOGE futures market. These bubbles consistently appear near major price peaks, suggesting the market may be overheating during those phases. Related Reading: Dogecoin Hits Critical Zone—Here’s What 3 Leading Analysts Are Watching In contrast, green and pink bubbles on the chart represent periods with lower retail participation. These phases typically coincide with more stable or “healthier” market conditions, which could offer better entry points for new investors. The analyst emphasized that monitoring these red bubbles may help both traders and investors anticipate potential short-term tops in DOGE. Spikes in retail participation often reflect heightened market greed – frequently a precursor to sharp price corrections. At present, Dogecoin futures activity appears to be in a neutral zone, indicating that the asset may still have room to grow before nearing an overheated state. This view is echoed by crypto analyst Anup Dhungana. In a recent post on X, Dhungana shared the following weekly DOGE chart showing a breakout from a long-term falling wedge pattern – a bullish technical setup that often precedes price rallies. Based on this breakout, the analyst forecasts that DOGE could reach $1 in the current market cycle. All Eyes On $1 DOGE The $1 price target has long been a symbolic milestone for Dogecoin enthusiasts. During the 2021 bull run, DOGE reached an all-time high (ATH) of $0.73 but ultimately fell short of the coveted $1 mark. Related Reading: Dogecoin Pullback May Be Short-Lived—Here’s The Next Price Target This time, however, several analysts believe that Dogecoin could finally hit the $1 milestone. Noted crypto analyst Kevin recently pointed to $1.10–$1.25 as a plausible target, based on Fibonacci retracement levels. However, seasoned market watcher Ali Martinez cautioned that DOGE must first overcome a significant resistance level at $0.36 to sustain its bullish momentum. At press time, DOGE trades at $0.22, up 1% in the past 24 hours.

Near Protocol has made progress with its first native vesting contract. This helps improve security and trust for AI and DeFi projects. At the same time, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen a big fall in trading volume and a 95% drop in its token burn rate. This raises questions about its current market strength. On the other hand, Unstaked is quietly attracting attention. It offers an AI platform aimed at clear utility. Unstaked has raised $6 million across 12 stages of its ongoing presale, with tokens priced at $0.008997. The planned launch price is $0.1819. Its projected 2,700% ROI is drawing early interest. More success and surprising numbers are still on the way. NEAR’s New Era: Vesting Contract Brings Stronger Security Rhea Finance and Intellex have launched the first vesting contract built for Near Protocol. This move gives projects on NEAR a safe way to manage token releases. Before this, NEAR did not have its own vesting system. This contract now offers a method to release tokens over time, lowering the risk of early sell-offs. It also meets audit rules to help projects meet standards. The contract works directly within the NEAR ecosystem and supports token projects, including AI and DeFi. It marks a step forward for NEAR in building tools for secure growth. This improvement could help attract more users and projects to the network. Shiba Inu’s Burn Rate Drops as Trading Activity Slows Shiba Inu’s burn rate has dropped sharply. Only 964,247 SHIB tokens were burned in the last day, a fall of 95%. Trading volume has also decreased, showing lower interest from traders. Token burns normally help reduce supply and support the price over time. The recent slowdown has raised doubts about SHIB’s short-term momentum. Despite this, SHIB’s price has remained mostly steady. This suggests holders are not selling in large amounts. Some believe this could be a quiet phase before a new move. A rise in burn rate or trading could hint at the next price trend. Unstaked Presale Nears Next Price Increase in Coming Days Unstaked aims to offer more than just another presale. It focuses on building AI tools that work across Telegram and X. These planned AI agents are designed to help grow online groups, manage conversations, and handle tasks without constant human effort. They are expected to begin working once the token launches. A key feature is the Proof of Intelligence system. It will track every action of these AI agents and record it on-chain. This makes all results clear and directly connects activity to the value of the Unstaked token. Users will be part of a system built on real use, not promises. The presale is now in stage 12 for $0.008997 per $UNSD. Each stage raises the price, with the launch price set near $0.1819. The projected return is around 2,700%. More than $6 million has already been raised. The next price change is expected soon, offering a limited chance for early access and planned utility. The Bottom Line Near Protocol has made progress in improving token security, a key move for long-term growth. Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen a drop in trading activity. Many holders remain cautious as momentum slows. Unstaked, however, is moving forward. Its AI agents are expected to begin work once the platform launches. The Proof of Intelligence system is designed to provide clear tracking and rewards based on results. With the crypto presale over $6 million raised and a current price of $0.008997 in stage 12, Unstaked focuses on creating a working system. The projected return of 2,700% and the next price increase make this an option to watch for long-term plans.

In threads across r/CryptoMoonShots , r/altcoin , and r/CryptoCurrency , users are debating why this new project could be the next 100x gainer — and the reasons are stacking up fast. MAGACOINFINANCE combines aggressive meme branding with a growing online presence, but what’s catching Reddit’s attention is its clear early traction , rapid investor growth , and low-entry price structure . Several threads have called it “ a rare setup for exponential returns ” — and traders are now racing to secure a position early. Why MAGACOINFINANCE Is Becoming the #1 Choice in 2025 Investors are shifting away from overbought majors like Ethereum and Cardano and turning their focus to high-potential altcoins/memecoins with viral potential . MAGACOINFINANCE is positioning itself as a strategic early-stage entry — with everything Reddit traders love: Bold branding Fast-growing community Clear listing goals Strong online traction without mainstream hype (yet) Redditors are already comparing MAGACOINFINANCE to early SHIBA INU , citing similar energy, user engagement, and a wave of organic support. Some even speculate that once this coin hits centralized exchanges, it could be one of the fastest-rising meme coins of the year . Reddit’s Verdict: The 100x Potential Is Still on the Table What sets MAGACOINFINANCE apart, according to Reddit discussions, is the calculated setup , a low initial price, token scarcity, and a rapidly expanding audience. Posts breaking down ROI scenarios have shown that even modest investments today could turn into life-changing returns if MAGACOINFINANCE delivers on its early promise. And with Reddit acting as a leading indicator for early crypto narratives, this kind of grassroots energy could be the spark that ignites a full-blown rally.

SEC: Deaton says SEC must admit faults for new XRP judgment,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/sec-must-admit-faults-for-new-ripple-case/,"After Judge Torres denied the Ripple SEC motion for an indicative ruling, legal experts have shared various perspectives on the next steps in the prolonged legal battle. Pro-crypto attorney and former senatorial candidate John Deaton also weighed in on the ruling, outlining what both parties need to do before Judge Torres can consider amending her judgment in the XRP lawsuit . SEC should acknowledge errors and work with Ripple for new judgment During a live broadcast, John Deaton explained that for a new judgment to be issued in the XRP lawsuit, the SEC must acknowledge its errors and withdraw its previous arguments. He emphasized that the Commission would need to collaborate with Ripple and reference current bills in Congress related to digital assets. By doing so, the SEC would recognize that crypto assets resemble commodities more than securities and may not fall under its regulatory authority. As reported by CoinGape, Judge Torres denied the SEC’s motion against Ripple, calling it “procedurally improper.” The SEC had requested relief from the injunction and sought to reduce the civil penalty to $50 million. To win the motion, Deaton thinks the SEC would have to persuade Judge Torres that Ripple’s sales of XRP caused no harm and that the injunction is preventing Ripple from conducting business—specifically from selling XRP to financial institutions. He also observed that the SEC would need to argue that the injunction poses its main harm to an American company and its prospective business partners. Judge Torres also pointed out that a district court ruling in favor of an indicative ruling motion must determine whether the proposed consent decree is fair and reasonable without risking harm to the public’s interest by including injunctive relief in the decree. Another legal expert outlines steps and timeline for challenging XRP judgment Attorney Fred Rispoli echoed Deaton’s sentiment, noting that getting a favorable new judgment to replace the existing judgment in the XRP suit would be an uphill battle. He proposed that both parties should file a 25-page motion listing all of the other cases that both have dismissed. Rispoli also suggested that the SEC submit declarations from its Commissioners and admit that the Commission has fallen short in its efforts to provide the market with clear guidance on crypto. He assumes the agency will take that approach, but it could be two to three weeks before Ripple and the SEC each complete their arguments and refile the motion. Rispoli then anticipates that Judge Torres will need another one or two weeks to decide. Following Judge Torres’ latest decision, the price of XRP fell more than 4%. At the time of writing, the altcoin is trading near $2.40, down almost 2% over the past 24 hours. SEC faces internal backlash over Ripple settlement Adding to the case’s complexity, internal disagreements have surfaced within the SEC itself. On May 8, the SEC and Ripple jointly filed a settlement letter in a New York court requesting the dissolution of the August 2024 injunction against Ripple and proposing that $75 million of the $125 million in civil penalties held in escrow be returned to the crypto company. SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw, known for her skeptical stance on crypto, blasted the pending deal in a May 8 statement, saying it would damage the regulators’ ability to keep crypto firms in line and undermine the court’s ruling. “This settlement, alongside the programmatic disassembly of the SEC’s crypto enforcement program, does a tremendous disservice to the investing public and undermines the court’s role in interpreting our securities laws,” she said. Her remarks highlight the growing divide within the Commission and raise broader concerns about the SEC’s consistency in addressing the rapidly evolving crypto landscape.

While PEPE , TRUMP , and Solana (SOL) have made waves in early 2025 , a quieter shift is unfolding beneath the surface—and MAGACOINFINANCE is emerging as a project quietly positioning for breakout. Unlike hype-driven pumps, MAGACOINFINANCE has opted for a deliberate growth path, combining a compelling political angle with disciplined token economics. Though still under the radar for many, its traction is beginning to accelerate. EARLY ACCESS ENDING SOON – ACT NOW Growing Attention as Investors Rotate into Value As of early May, MAGACOINFINANCE remains in its structured pre-sale phase, steadily building both its user base and community engagement across platforms like Discord and Twitter/X. This expansion is taking place at a time when investor sentiment is shifting—from overhyped launches to smaller, undervalued tokens with strong narratives. With broader interest forming around rotation trades, MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining visibility among early movers and contrarian investors alike. Uptick in On-Chain Metrics and Wallet Activity Traders seeking overlooked opportunities are taking note of MAGACOINFINANCE for more than just its branding. Wallet analysis now shows increased inflows from mid-sized Ethereum wallets, often associated with early-stage venture plays. While volumes remain modest, these signs mirror pre-rally accumulation patterns seen in previous market cycles. In addition to rising community interest, its new tokenomics design—featuring time-locked releases and open developer wallets—aims to avoid the liquidity pitfalls common to meme-driven tokens. Tokenomics That Encourage Loyalty, Not Dumping Whereas most tokens struggle to sustain price post-launch, MAGACOINFINANCE integrates mechanisms to promote holding. Controlled liquidity access, transparent supply caps, and structured token vesting have helped it avoid early dumping, attracting more serious long-term holders. This stability-first approach sets it apart in a landscape often dominated by short-lived momentum trades. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Is This the Breakout Rotation Trade of Summer 2025? Analysts are beginning to tag MAGACOINFINANCE in their rotation watchlists. Here’s what’s catching attention: Social Growth : A 60% surge in Twitter/X visibility over the past three weeks Holder Distribution : Balanced wallet distribution minimizes whale influence Engagement-to-Market Cap : Matching early FLOKI and TRUMP coin metrics from prior cycles These data points suggest that the token is being positioned for a strategic move. With altcoin rotation in full swing, MAGACOINFINANCE could become a standout from the smaller-cap sector. Conclusion: Quiet Today, But Not for Long Market interest is steadily shifting toward lower-cap, narrative-rich tokens that offer room to surprise. While projects like KASPA , XRP , and PEPE remain solid names, their large caps may limit near-term upside for new entrants. MAGACOINFINANCE , however, appears earlier in its cycle—right where long-term breakouts often begin. With increased on-chain signals, social traction, and a smart token design, this altcoin may soon move from quiet accumulation to center stage. Summer could tell the story—and MAGACOINFINANCE is writing the first chapters now.

44717019,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=752924,1747447218,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/44717019.jpeg,"Bitcoin Up $18,000, But HODLer Profits Same As On April 1—Here’s Why",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-17000-hodler-profits-april-1-heres-why/,"On-chain data shows the profit margin of the Bitcoin long-term holders is currently the same as when BTC was still $85,000. Here’s what’s behind this. Bitcoin Long-Term Holder NUPL Has Returned To 0.69 In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about the trend in the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) for the Bitcoin long-term holders. The NUPL is an indicator that keeps track of the difference between the unrealized profit and unrealized loss held by the BTC investors as a whole. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could See Short-Term Holder Selloff Around These Levels, Analyst Says When the value of this metric is positive, it means the holders are carrying more profit than loss. On the other hand, it being under zero suggests the average address is underwater. In the context of the current topic, the NUPL of the entire network isn’t of relevance, but rather that of just one segment of it: the long-term holders (LTHs). The LTHs refer to the BTC investors who have been holding onto their coins since more than 155 days ago. Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the Bitcoin NUPL for the LTHs over the past year: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin LTH NUPL has remained above the zero level for the past year, implying that the HODLers of the market have stayed in the green. But naturally, as the BTC price has shown some volatile moves in this period, the indicator’s value has also witnessed some fluctuations. From the chart, it’s apparent that the bull run at the end of 2024 took the indicator into an extreme territory, but the market downturn this year resulted in a cooldown for it. With the recent price recovery run, the metric again noted a reversal, but even at its peak, it still couldn’t come close to touching the high from the earlier bull run. An interesting trend has followed since this latest peak in the Bitcoin LTH NUPL; the indicator has observed a sharp retrace, despite the fact that the coin’s value has only been moving flat in this window. The metric is now sitting at 0.69, which is the same level as back at the start of April, when the cryptocurrency was still just trading around $85,000. What’s making it so that HODLer profitability is the same today despite the price being notably higher? And what’s the reason for the latest decline in the metric even though the price has been going sideways? Related Reading: Ethereum Bullish Signal: $1.2 Billion In ETH Leaves Exchanges The answer to these questions lies in what the LTH group represents. As mentioned earlier, this cohort includes investors who purchased their Bitcoin within the past 155 days. This five-month cutoff now includes the buyers from December 2024. In other words, the promotion of these top buyers into the group has diluted the unrealized gain among its members. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $103,500, up over 1% in the last 24 hours.

Currently trading around $651.79, BNB has remained within a key channel between $642.29 and $654.97. Despite short-term consolidation, the token’s value proposition remains intact, with broader use in gas fees, token launches, and DeFi integrations. While volume has declined, analysts believe a close near the $654.97 resistance could initiate a fresh test of the $660 level. However, from a midterm perspective, BNB is likely to remain range-bound between $600 and $650—signaling accumulation in a relatively stable zone.Amid these developments, Qubetics ($TICS) is emerging as the top crypto with 100x potential for those looking to solve critical privacy, security, and accessibility issues. Unlike its predecessors, Qubetics delivers decentralized internet utilities that tackle today’s most pressing digital challenges. Through real-world application and groundbreaking architecture, it offers enterprise and personal solutions in a format built for scale, sustainability, and everyday use. One such innovation is its Decentralized VPN , designed to transform how professionals and businesses interact online. Theta is gaining momentum across Europe, beginning with its upcoming May 27th community and developer meetup in Munich, followed by preparations for September’s highly anticipated ThetaEuroCon in Berlin. The network continues to deliver real-world use cases in decentralized video streaming, edge computing, and data delivery—all powered by its two-token system: THETA and TFUEL. As household names like Google, Sony, and Samsung back Theta as Enterprise Validators, and the platform opens up to EVM-compatible DApp deployment, it’s evident that Theta is positioning itself as a critical infrastructure layer for the decentralized internet. Qubetics ($TICS): Decentralized VPN Powering Privacy, Anonymity, and Accessibility Qubetics introduces a Decentralized VPN (dVPN) system that gives users control over their digital identity and traffic like never before. Unlike centralized VPNs that store user data, control exit nodes, and are vulnerable to shutdowns or surveillance, Qubetics offers a permissionless privacy layer powered by blockchain infrastructure. This dVPN is censorship-resistant, peer-to-peer, and fully encrypted—empowering individuals, remote teams, and businesses with secure and anonymous access to the global internet. Digital nomads, financial professionals, activists, and large-scale enterprises alike can route data through a decentralized web, eliminating centralized bottlenecks and surveillance risks. Through integrated token-based access, users can pay in $TICS for secure bandwidth, while node providers are compensated in real-time. This decentralized privacy utility redefines how people work, transact, and collaborate globally—without ever compromising on trust or transparency. The combination of high throughput, real-world accessibility, and seamless user integration makes Qubetics one of the most transformative protocols launching today—and a standout in any discussion of the top crypto with 100x potential . Explosive Qubetics Presale Performance and High-ROI Entry Point The Qubetics crypto presale is currently in Stage 34, where the $TICS token is priced at $0.2532. So far, over 512 million tokens have been sold to 26,500+ holders, raising a total of more than $17 million. Those who entered during Stage 1 at $0.01 per token are now seeing a return of 2,432%, validating the project’s strong fundamentals and demand among early adopters. However, the presale is not over. Community members can still enter the ongoing stage at $0.2532 and potentially achieve high ROI outcomes as the project matures. According to current projections: $TICS at $1 would yield a 294% ROI. $TICS at $5 delivers a 1,874% ROI. $TICS at $6 produces a 2,269% ROI. $TICS at $10 unlocks a 3,848% ROI. $TICS at $15 results in a 5,822% ROI after mainnet launch. With the dVPN feature and other high-utility modules integrated into its roadmap, Qubetics offers not only access but also functional value that meets pressing demands in digital infrastructure. Those seeking the top crypto with 100x potential should pay close attention before the window to participate narrows further. Theta (THETA): Enterprise-Backed Video Delivery and EVM-Based Smart Contracts Theta has built a strong reputation as the go-to blockchain platform for decentralized video delivery. It solves longstanding challenges in centralized streaming—such as high costs, lag, and poor user monetization—by creating a peer-to-peer video content delivery network where participants share bandwidth and are rewarded in TFUEL tokens. The dual-token system (THETA and TFUEL) supports everything from governance to micro-transactions, making Theta a robust decentralized economy. Backed by major companies including Google, Samsung, Sony, and Binance, Theta is now expanding its community engagement in Europe through the Theta World Tour . The Munich meetup on May 27th marks a strategic checkpoint for building momentum ahead of ThetaEuroCon in Berlin. These events are designed to align developers, partners, and content creators toward the platform’s mission of shaping the future of media through blockchain. Theta’s EVM-compatibility further opens the door to seamless DApp integration, allowing developers to deploy smart contracts without reworking Ethereum-based code. This flexibility, coupled with its global validator network and mass-adoption potential, cements Theta’s position as a top crypto with 100x potential . Binance Coin (BNB): Exchange Utility and Ecosystem Integration BNB remains a central utility token within the Binance ecosystem, serving as the engine behind a wide range of functions, including trading fee discounts, token sales, DEX operations, and DeFi integrations. Trading near $651.79 , BNB has remained confined between $642.29 and $654.97 , with short-term volatility subdued by lower volume. From a mid-term outlook, the token appears poised to continue sideways trading between $600 and $650 —indicating stability amid market churn. However, BNB’s value is not solely price-dependent. Its utility stretches across Binance’s vast product suite, including the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), NFT platforms, staking, and cross-chain liquidity tools. This makes BNB indispensable for daily users of Binance services, and its burn mechanism ensures long-term scarcity. BNB’s strength lies in its integration across one of the world’s most widely used crypto ecosystems. This gives it a strong case as a top crypto with 100x potential —not due to speculative surges, but because of reliable infrastructure growth and token use consolidation. Final Thoughts Qubetics, Theta, and BNB each represent unique avenues into the future of blockchain-powered solutions. Qubetics stands out with its decentralized VPN and presale traction, Theta continues to transform digital media with real utility and enterprise validation, and BNB powers one of the most comprehensive crypto platforms in existence. For early buyers, the Qubetics presale still offers a powerful entry point with measurable upside. Theta’s roadmap is gaining traction globally, while BNB offers stable exposure to the centralized-decentralized hybrid future. These are not just speculative tokens—they are utility-based projects shaping tomorrow’s digital economy. To secure a position in a blockchain future driven by application, performance, and community utility, the time to act is now. These are the top crypto with 100x potential —but access at this level won’t last long.

While major coins like Ethereum, XRP, and Dogecoin continue to consolidate with minimal upside, MAGACOINFINANCE is quietly moving in a different direction. Early chatter suggests this might be one of the few tokens still capable of delivering outsized returns — with a confirmed Uniswap listing at $0.007 and speculation of much higher valuations to come. Early Momentum Is Building Fast There’s no viral TikTok campaign or celebrity endorsement here — just steady growth and focused execution. Since its launch, MAGACOINFINANCE has gained traction primarily through grassroots interest , backed by a combination of meme appeal, strong tokenomics, and precise communication with its community. It’s a formula that reminds seasoned investors of what made tokens like SHIBA INU and PEPE take off. But what’s different here is the project’s deliberate pacing — and the clear pricing strategy that early buyers are paying close attention to. Why Investors Are Watching the $0.007 Milestone Closely According to sources close to the project, MAGACOINFINANCE is preparing for an initial listing at $0.007 — and this price is already serving as a benchmark for investor models. But the conversation doesn’t end there. Some analysts have projected the token could reach $0.07 on Tier 1 exchanges if adoption continues to scale — a 240x return based on early positioning. More speculative models suggest that if MAGACOINFINANCE becomes a truly global meme coin, a price point of $0.70 is not out of reach — a massive 2,400x multiple . While these higher-end scenarios are hypothetical, what matters is that investors have measurable, structured milestones — and that’s rare in the current wave of meme-driven tokens. More Than Just Hype — Community Growth Signals Real Potential On-chain activity and social analytics platforms show a steady increase in engagement around MAGACOINFINANCE . Telegram chats are expanding, Twitter mentions are climbing, and wallet distribution appears healthy — all key signs of sustainable early momentum. What’s resonating most with buyers, though, is the sense of starting fresh . Many in the space missed out on the early days of TrumpCoin, DOGE, or SHIBA — and MAGACOINFINANCE is now offering a second chance to be early on a politically-themed, community-driven crypto with actual structure behind it. A Calculated Entry in a Hype-Driven Market In a market filled with noise, MAGACOINFINANCE is quietly gaining favor among those who are looking for a strategic entry , not just another viral meme. It’s not being force-fed through influencers or overhyped social trends — instead, it’s growing through a consistent rollout and rising organic interest. With the $0.007 listing on the horizon , and discussions of reaching 240x or even 2,400x in the next cycle, MAGACOINFINANCE is starting to look like one of the few remaining early-stage projects with real upside .

According to a May 15 statement from Paraguayan prosecutor Irene Rolón , the men were caught by police soon after breaking into a locked section of Teratech SA’s facility in Coronel Bogado, leading to their arrest. Prosecutors believe the men may have had ties to Teratech as independent contractors, but are still waiting on official confirmation from the company’s CEO. The three deported were Chinese nationals Jinping Duan, Tian Jianyun and Zheng Guanglong, who did not have official entry records into the country. Paraguayan authorities and Interpol believe the men illegally entered through Brazil or Bolivia. The three deported Chinese nationals pictured before leaving the country. Source: PDS Radio Y TV Digital The other person arrested, Nahun María Velázquez Garcete, is a legal resident in Paraguay but is believed to be part of a criminal organization. He has been charged with aggravated theft and is currently in pretrial detention. The arrested individual was hospitalized in critical condition soon after the arrest, but the injuries sustained weren’t disclosed. Paraguayan officials believe other individuals were involved in the attempted theft and are working to identify those people. As such, the case is still under investigation. Deportees may have been working illegally for months Rolón believes the undocumented immigrants had been in Paraguay for several months and had come to work as programmers. However, it isn’t clear whether that work was performed for the company. Paraguayan officials are waiting on a report from Teratech’s CEO to determine the exact nature of his relationship with the three men.

Letter Rejects “False Choice” Co-founder Zach Witkoff released a May 15 letter to Senator Richard Blumenthal in which company attorneys said lawmakers’ concerns were based on “fundamentally flawed premises and inaccuracies.” “The Company rejects the false choice between innovation and oversight,” the letter argued. “What it opposes is the misuses of regulatory authority and uncertainty to suppress lawful innovation.” WLFI maintains that questions surrounding its USD1 stablecoin do not warrant sweeping investigations that could stall development. Democrats Press Conflict-of-Interest Angle Blumenthal, ranking member of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, has rallied Democrats to examine potential conflicts stemming from former President Donald Trump’s stake in WLFI, his TRUMP memecoin, and a forthcoming dinner for top tokenholders. The senator warned that “WLFI’s financial entanglements with the President, his family, and the Trump Administration present unprecedented conflicts of interest and national security risks, including potential violations of the foreign emoluments clause.” Stablecoin Bill Could Decide the Matter Attention is now fixed on the GENIUS Act, a Republican-sponsored measure that would grant payment-instrument status to certain stablecoins. Should USD1 qualify under the legislation, critics fear Trump could benefit financially while also influencing the regulatory environment in which the product operates. Some Democrats have proposed amendments to ensure no sitting or former president can profit from a stablecoin they could later help legitimize. WLFI Says It Is “Too Busy Building” Despite the political storm, Witkoff insists the team is focused on launching products and onboarding users rather than lobbying. He characterizes oversight efforts as distractions that risk pushing stablecoin innovation offshore. What Happens Next The GENIUS Act’s timeline remains unclear, and Senate leadership has not scheduled a vote. If the bill advances, expect renewed scrutiny of WLFI’s cap table and the extent of Trump family involvement.

Lightchain AI Investors Brace for Big Gains,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/dogecoins-dip-the-calm-before-the-bull-run-lightchain-ai-investors-brace-for-big-gains/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) is presently experiencing a decline, leaving many experts discussing the chances of a bullish rebound. Meanwhile, Lightchain AI has been gaining a lot of attention and attraction among investors. This new project combines blockchain technology with artificial intelligence, emerging as the best choice for investors looking into the future. Currently, the presale is at $0.007, with Lightchain AI raising over $20 million in funding, showing that investors trust the project. With its special approach and clear roadmap, Lightchain AI has been predicted to lead the market when the next boom happens. Dogecoin’s Decline- Setup for Potential Bullish Comeback? Dogecoin (DOGE) has crashed, falling more than 30% in the last few months. However, its technical indicators show that the token could witness a turnaround. The falling wedge and a potential triple bottom around the $0.168 support, all these points that the token is now close to the bulls. In addition, the rise in whale holdings and social media noise shows that investors are still interested in the token. Analysts have also predicted that a move above $0.18 would push the asset towards $0.20, with some predicting that the asset could even move as igh as $0.22 should the bulls hold on. And although the market is still volatile, these events suggest that Dogecoin could mount a comeback. Why Lightchain AI is Standing Out in Changing Market Lightchain AI is quickly becoming an important player in the crypto industry, thanks to its approach of mixing blockchain and AI, solving past issues. The platform’s governance system ensures that token holders have the power to make changes through a decentralized democratic process, ensuring transparency and inclusivity. Using on-chain voting, the community can actively participate in shaping the platform’s future, build trust, and collaborate. By decentralizing AI model training and decision-making, Lightchain AI addresses issues like bias and centralized control, ensuring fairness and reducing the dominance of monopolies. The project’s need for interoperability ensures smooth integration with other blockchains and popular AI frameworks, ensuring usability and adoption. These features make Lightchain AI one of the best projects, gaining attention in today’s ever-growing market. Lightchain AI- Future of Blockchain Meets AI Innovation Lightchain AI has been turning the crypto world upside down, and investors are still not satisfied. This is not just another crypto project, it is one of the best. By adding the potential of blockchain with AI, Lightchain AI is breaking the barrier that would have kept this technology from reaching the public. Smart investors are not waiting around as they have recognized this project as an early opportunity to make profits so they are jumping in. Lightchain is more than just a new project, it is a movement that is driven by the power of its community. Transparency, fairness, and decentralized decision-making are at its core, perfectly matching the demands for equity and inclusivity in the crypto ecosystem. The crypto space is changing fast, and Lightchain AI is leading the move towards a decentralized and fairer future. Don’t get left behind–be part of the best new thing.

Over the past two weeks, DOGE has risen by more than 25%, pushing its price as high as $0.24. Despite this growth, the asset experienced a slight pullback in the past 24 hours, retreating by 0.3% to $0.22 at the time of writing. The latest movements mark a period of renewed interest in the asset, particularly from retail traders. Related Reading: Dogecoin Pullback May Be Short-Lived—Here’s The Next Price Target Dogecoin Retail Activity and Sentiment Indicators One of CryptoQuant’s contributors, Burak Kesmeci, recently shared new insights into DOGE’s futures market activity. In a post titled “Too Many Retail Traders? DOGE Futures Show Repeated Peak Patterns”, Kesmeci pointed to the potential influence of speculative trading behavior. His analysis highlights that previous peaks in Dogecoin’s price have often coincided with a sharp increase in retail participation in futures markets, raising questions about the sustainability of such rallies. Kesmeci’s analysis centers around a visual metric that tracks trading activity from retail investors within DOGE futures markets. In this chart, red bubbles mark moments when retail trading spikes significantly. These periods, according to the analyst, have historically aligned with local price tops, suggesting that elevated speculative behavior often precedes short-term corrections. On the other hand, green and pink bubbles, representing periods of reduced retail activity, have typically aligned with more stable or neutral price phases. The underlying interpretation is that when DOGE futures markets become saturated with retail participants, the likelihood of momentum exhaustion increases. For traders, these retail spikes may serve as potential warning signals of short-term reversals. As Kesmeci notes, this data can be used in conjunction with other technical and on-chain metrics to build a more comprehensive view of market sentiment, especially in volatile assets like Dogecoin. The analysis supports a more cautious approach where retail enthusiasm dominates trading volumes. Technical Forecast Suggests Possible Rally Continuation While futures data indicates caution around potential retail-driven tops, other technical perspectives suggest the possibility of further upside. Crypto analyst Javon Marks recently shared an outlook indicating that DOGE may be positioned for a continuation toward a new all-time high. Related Reading: Where’s Next Major Dogecoin Resistance? On-Chain Data Points To This According to Marks, the asset has confirmed a major bullish signal on its chart, suggesting that another leg of upward momentum may already be in play.

Designed to meet the expectations of serious investors, it combines professional auditing, well-considered tokenomics, and a transparent development team — creating a framework that supports sustainable traction. With a growing community and clear interest across crypto channels , MAGACOINFINANCE is not positioning itself as a quick trend, but as a long-term player aligned with best practices in decentralized finance. This review takes a closer look at the essential elements that are fueling the project’s early rise. THE CLOCK IS TICKING FAST – ACT NOW Verified by Hashex: A Strong Signal of Security and Oversight Perhaps the most important development to date is the completion of a full smart contract audit by Hashex , a respected name in blockchain security. The audit assessed MAGACOINFINANCE for structural vulnerabilities, ensuring that the project meets key thresholds for integrity, transparency, and protection against contract-level exploits. A successful audit at this stage provides two essential benefits: Investor trust — with technical validation confirming the absence of critical risks. Market reputation — helping MAGACOINFINANCE distinguish itself from the many unaudited tokens that populate the space. In a market where early-stage scams remain a real concern, passing a Hashex audit is a strong endorsement of project legitimacy . Tokenomics Designed for Stability and Ecosystem Growth MAGACOINFINANCE introduces a balanced tokenomics model built around long-term sustainability. Rather than overpromising or engineering aggressive short-term gains, the token structure reflects a thoughtful allocation model, designed to support the ecosystem, reward early participants, and protect overall market health. While exact distribution percentages are kept simple for broader accessibility, it is evident that the developers have focused on designing a structure that encourages responsible participation and community growth — a key differentiator in today’s volatile presale environment. Token Sale Success Highlights Investor Confidence MAGACOINFINANCE’s early token sale performance has exceeded expectations , with notable demand emerging shortly after the project went live. From individual investors to private communities, the response has been swift and positive — an indicator of the trust being placed in the project’s foundation. The fast-paced nature of the sale reflects rising momentum , as well as a broader desire among investors to identify opportunities that pair innovation with a clear commitment to compliance and transparency. In that respect, MAGACOINFINANCE is delivering a rare mix of credibility and upside potential. Why MAGACOINFINANCE Has Everyone Watching Closely As the broader altcoin market prepares for what many analysts expect to be an active cycle, projects like MAGACOINFINANCE — those that enter with security audits, clear tokenomics, and real-time traction — are earning fast recognition. Industry observers and early-stage analysts have flagged MAGACOINFINANCE as a token with the essential qualities needed to survive beyond the initial hype phase . Its strategy of prioritizing infrastructure and transparency from day one is paying off, as more investors gravitate toward projects with tangible credibility. CLICK HERE – 25x GROWTH STILL ON THE TABLE Conclusion: MAGACOINFINANCE Is Building the Right Way Unlike many short-lived crypto launches, MAGACOINFINANCE is setting the tone for how responsible altcoin projects should approach market entry . With a completed Hashex audit , clearly communicated tokenomics, and successful initial momentum, it is paving a path that combines security, structure, and scalable investor participation. This is a project designed with long-term thinking in mind — and for that reason alone, it deserves the attention it is receiving across the crypto community.

Unlike traditional security systems, blockchain uses decentralized networks that make it nearly impossible to alter or hack information. This level of protection addresses growing cybersecurity threats that many organizations face today. By integrating blockchain, companies gain enhanced transparency, data integrity and trust. The adoption of blockchain technology is no longer limited to finance. Industries such as healthcare, supply chain and government are harnessing blockchain integration to safeguard sensitive data. Its immutable ledger system ensures every transaction is recorded with a timestamp, making fraud and unauthorized access easier to detect and prevent. How blockchain integration enhances cybersecurity Blockchain integration improves cybersecurity by decentralizing data storage. Instead of relying on a single server, blockchain distributes information across a network of nodes. This approach reduces the risk of data breaches since hackers must compromise multiple points simultaneously. The cryptographic techniques embedded in blockchain add another protective layer, ensuring data remains confidential and tamper-proof. Moreover, blockchain integration allows for secure identity management. Users can control their data with cryptographic keys, reducing reliance on passwords that are vulnerable to phishing attacks. This shift enhances privacy while maintaining accessibility for authorized parties. It also supports secure sharing of information without exposing raw data, which is crucial in industries handling sensitive details. Blockchain integration in healthcare data protection Healthcare data is one of the most sensitive types of information, often targeted by cybercriminals. Blockchain integration offers a solution by creating a secure, tamper-proof record of patient information. This means medical records cannot be altered without detection, improving both data integrity and patient trust. In addition, blockchain supports interoperability among healthcare providers. Secure data exchange enables better coordination of care while maintaining patient confidentiality. Smart contracts on the blockchain can automate consent management, allowing patients to control who accesses their data with clear audit trails. Securing supply chain data with blockchain integration Supply chains involve many parties – from manufacturers to retailers – each generating data critical to product integrity and authenticity. Blockchain integration provides an immutable record of every step in the supply chain, reducing fraud and ensuring transparency. This creates accountability and enables quick tracing of products in case of defects or recalls. By using blockchain, companies also streamline compliance with regulations. The technology’s transparency simplifies audits and reporting, while secure data sharing fosters collaboration among partners without compromising proprietary information. Ultimately, blockchain strengthens trust between consumers and brands by verifying product origin and handling. Blockchain integration transforming financial industry security The financial sector was an early adopter of blockchain integration due to its high security needs. Blockchain protects transactions by recording them on a distributed ledger, eliminating single points of failure. This drastically reduces fraud, money laundering and identity theft risks. Additionally, blockchain enables faster, more secure cross-border payments. It cuts down on intermediaries, lowers transaction costs and provides real-time tracking. Financial institutions benefit from improved regulatory compliance through transparent and verifiable transaction histories. Government applications of blockchain integration for data security Governments manage vast amounts of citizen data that must remain secure and accessible only to authorized users. Blockchain integration offers a resilient infrastructure for voting systems, land registries and identity verification. By providing a tamper-proof record, blockchain helps prevent election fraud and corruption. Furthermore, blockchain facilitates secure public service delivery by enabling transparent and accountable workflows. Citizens gain confidence in government actions as blockchain promotes open auditing and data integrity. This technological integration builds trust between governments and the people they serve. Conclusion – T he future of data security with blockchain integration Blockchain integration is redefining data security standards across various industries. Its decentralized, transparent and tamper-resistant nature provides unmatched protection against cyber threats. As more sectors adopt this technology, they unlock new opportunities for secure data sharing, compliance and operational efficiency. The ongoing advancements in blockchain promise an even stronger security landscape. Organizations that embrace blockchain integration will stay ahead in protecting their data and earning the trust of their stakeholders. This shift is not just a technological upgrade but a fundamental change in how we safeguard information.

However, five new cryptocurrencies are gearing up for remarkable growth next year. With the potential to soar by up to 16,900%, these digital assets might soon overshadow Bitcoin. This article delves into these up-and-coming contenders that could redefine the future of cryptocurrency. Undervalued $XYZ Meme Coin Gears Up for Listing on a Major CEX XYZVerse ($XYZ) is the meme coin that has grabbed headlines with its ambitious claim of rising from $0.0001 to $0.1 during a presale phase. So far, it has gone halfway, raising over $13 million, and the price of the $XYZ token currently stands at $0.003333 . At the next 13th stage of the presale, the $XYZ token value will further rise to $0.005 , meaning that early investors have the chance to secure a bigger discount. Following the presale, $XYZ will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The team has not disclosed the details yet, but they have put a teaser for a big launch. Born for Fighters, Built for Champions XYZVerse is building a community for those hungry for big profits in crypto — the relentless, the ambitious, the ones aiming for dominance. This is a coin for true fighters — a mindset that resonates with athletes and sports fans alike. $XYZ is the token for thrill-seekers chasing the next big meme coin. Central to the XYZVerse story is XYZepe — a fighter in the meme coin arena, battling to climb the charts and make it to the top on CoinMarketCap. Will it become the next DOGE or SHIB? Time will tell. Community-First Vibes In XYZVerse, the community runs the show. Active participants earn hefty rewards, and the team has allocated a massive 10% of the total token supply — around 10 billion $XYZ — for airdrops, making it one of the largest airdrops on record. Backed by solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and regular token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every move is designed to boost momentum, drive price growth, and rally a loyal community that knows this could be the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More — Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Solana (SOL): A High-Performance Blockchain for Scalable Applications Solana is a blockchain platform designed for scalability and speed. It provides a foundation for decentralized applications (dapps), competing with platforms like Ethereum and Cardano. Solana’s architecture focuses on faster transactions and supports development in multiple programming languages. The native cryptocurrency, SOL, is central to the Solana ecosystem. It facilitates transactions, powers custom programs, and rewards participants who support the network. SOL holds value by underpinning the operation of the Solana ecosystem. It rewards network participants and gives users access to various projects on the platform. Unlike some blockchains, Solana does not use sharding or second-layer solutions to achieve scalability. Its high-capacity network aims to attract developers and investors interested in hosting products and services that require high activity. In the current market cycle, Solana’s focus on scalability and performance positions it as a notable option among blockchain platforms. BNB: The Native Cryptocurrency of the Binance Ecosystem BNB is the native cryptocurrency of the Binance platform, introduced in June 2017 as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. It now operates on both the Binance Chain and Binance Smart Chain. BNB facilitates fee payments, token issuance, and asset transfers within these networks. It supports smart contracts through a Proof-of-Staked Authority consensus mechanism, allowing users to earn rewards by staking. Beyond blockchain transactions, BNB provides fee discounts on Binance.com and is accepted by various third-party services. The supply of BNB is systematically reduced through quarterly burns, aiming to halve the initial supply of 200 million tokens. This reduction strategy can enhance the value of the remaining tokens over time. The combination of its utility in the Binance ecosystem, staking rewards, and supply reduction may make BNB an attractive option for users. In the current market cycle, BNB continues to play a significant role due to its versatile applications and the ongoing efforts to manage its supply. TRON (TRX): A Blockchain Platform for Decentralized Content and Applications TRON (TRX) is a decentralized blockchain platform launched by the Tron Foundation in 2017. TRX tokens were initially based on Ethereum’s ERC-20 standard but moved to their own network in 2018. The project aims to give full ownership rights to digital content creators by allowing them to receive rewards directly from consumers without intermediaries like YouTube or Facebook. TRON supports smart contracts, various blockchain systems, and decentralized applications (dApps). It uses a transaction model similar to Bitcoin’s UTXO, with transactions recorded on a public ledger accessible to all users. By enabling content creators to interact directly with consumers, TRON seeks to decentralize the internet and empower users. Developers can create dApps on the TRON network and offer content in exchange for digital assets. This model promotes open content sharing without concerns over transaction fees. As an alternative to Ethereum, TRON provides tools for building decentralized applications with potentially lower costs and higher scalability. Its potential for growth in the decentralized app sector makes it an interesting option in the current market cycle. Polkadot (DOT): Enhancing Interoperability in Blockchain Networks Polkadot is a decentralized protocol and cryptocurrency designed to enable secure communication between different blockchains. It allows value and data to be shared across networks like Ethereum and Bitcoin without intermediaries. This is achieved through the use of parachains, which improve speed and scalability. Polkadot processes transactions more efficiently than Bitcoin and Ethereum. The native token, DOT, is used for governance and staking within the network. DOT holders can participate in the development of the protocol and the transaction verification process. Polkadot was developed by Gavin Wood, a co-creator of Ethereum, and launched on May 26, 2020, under the maintenance of the Web3 Foundation. Polkadot addresses the challenge of interoperability among blockchains. By facilitating communication between different networks, it opens opportunities for more integrated and versatile applications. The parachain architecture helps overcome scalability issues found in other blockchain platforms. In the current market cycle, Polkadot’s approach to interoperability and scalability presents it as a notable option in the blockchain space. Its technology aims to meet the growing demand for interconnected and efficient blockchain solutions. Conclusion While SOL, BNB, TRX, and DOT show promise for huge gains, XYZVerse (XYZ) aims even higher with a 20,000% growth target, uniting sports fans in a unique memecoin ecosystem.

SHIB is holding steady near key support levels. XRP is building up with strong chart signals. BlockDAG (BDAG) , however, is making waves with a massive $251 million raise and a big reveal event scheduled for June 13. This reveal will include the final 15 exchange listings for BDAG, on top of the five already confirmed. The team has hinted at major U.S. exchanges but plans to keep those secret until the day arrives. Unlike many projects that wait until launch to share listing updates, BlockDAG is flipping the script. The June 13 reveal is not the launch day. The actual launch will happen when BlockDAG’s presale reaches its $600 million target. Until then, the project is offering a frozen entry price of $0.0020. This approach highlights preparation, confidence, and structure as the project pushes forward toward one of the year’s most-watched releases. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Finds Support Amid Technical Stability SHIB maintains its support around $0.00001690, with a 7% jump within 24 hours. Analysts point to strong support from the 20, 50, 100, and 200 exponential moving averages. The 20 EMA offers a solid base at $0.00001560, giving SHIB a chance to hold firm and rise again. Technical analysis shows SHIB forming a continuation flag on its 4-hour chart. If support near $0.00001650 remains strong, SHIB might retest its earlier highs. Some analysts believe it could aim for $0.000095 later in the year. While it may not repeat its explosive 2021 surge, the chart setup gives SHIB a decent shot at generating gains in the near term. The coin’s structure suggests it still has room to climb in the next few months if current support zones stay intact and trading volume increases gradually. XRP Builds Toward All-Time High on Whale Activity XRP is trading near $2.45 after gaining 3.19% in a day and rising about 20% in a month. Analysts say it is moving into a breakout pattern, backed by strong volume and a bullish triangle formation. Support remains firm at $1.75, while eyes are now on higher resistance points. One driver behind this growth is the activity from large holders. A recent $5.84 million long position opened by a whale has boosted market confidence. With increasing volume and a solid setup, analysts expect the current momentum to continue. If this pattern holds and broader crypto market sentiment doesn’t shift, XRP could make another attempt to test its previous all-time highs. The structure looks promising for those watching key technical signals and chart indicators. BlockDAG’s $251M Raise and Exchange Reveal Gain Traction While SHIB and XRP show signs of growth through chart patterns, BlockDAG is grabbing attention for its milestones. It has now raised over $251 million, with Batch 28 priced at $0.0262, offering a 2,520% increase from its starting batch. More than 20.4 billion coins have already been sold. The highlight is its June 13 Go Live Reveal, where BlockDAG will share the final list of 20 exchanges for BDAG listings. Five are already named: MEXC, LBank, CoinStore, XT.com, and BitMart. The remaining 15 are being kept under wraps until the reveal. This isn’t the official launch but a strategic midpoint. The actual listing will take place once the presale hits $600 million. Until June 13, the project has locked the price at $0.0020, marking a final entry point before it adjusts to market rates. More progress is coming from its hardware side. BlockDAG confirmed that miner shipment videos will be released soon. Devices like the X10, X30, and X100 are being prepared for customers. Over $7 million worth of miners have been sold, totalling 17,525 units so far. BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles is also in headlines, where 100 million coins are up for grabs daily. The biggest buyer of the day receives any leftover supply, adding a new layer of excitement to the presale. Wrapping It Up SHIB shows firm support, and XRP’s rise suggests a potential push toward old highs. But BlockDAG is taking the spotlight for its sharp execution and forward planning. With a $251 million raise, confirmed exchange listings, and physical miner deliveries underway, BlockDAG looks well prepared for its next phase. The Go Live Reveal on June 13 will unveil the full trading roadmap across 20 exchanges. Until that date, the entry price is frozen at $0.0020. Afterwards, with listings going public and momentum building, pricing will shift based on demand and market activity. As SHIB and XRP follow technical patterns, BlockDAG is carving a more structured path. That makes it one of the standout projects heading into the rest of 2025.

However, after reaching this level, the asset appears to have encountered resistance, with upward momentum slowing and price action remaining relatively flat in recent days. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $103,663, reflecting a modest 1.7% increase over the past 24 hours. Amid this price performance, one of CryptoQuant’s top analysts, Darkfost, offered insight into the current market stagnation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Stalls as SOPR Spikes: Analyst Explains What It Means Derivatives Market Activity Signals Short-Term Uncertainty According to his post on X, the root of the slowdown appears to stem from the derivatives market. Specifically, he pointed to the cumulative net taker volume, a metric that tracks the net volume of market orders, remaining in negative territory since BTC crossed above the psychological $100,000 threshold. This suggests that there are more aggressive sell orders (shorts) than buy orders (longs), creating persistent downward pressure on price. Net taker volume is a useful gauge of real-time trader sentiment, and when it trends negative, it typically signals that market participants expect prices to drop, prompting more short-selling. 📊 The main reason why BTC is currently stuck at these levels comes from the derivatives market. 💥The cumulative net taker volume has mostly remained in negative territory ever since BTC climbed back above the psychological $100 000 level. – What does this mean ? ⁰In simple… pic.twitter.com/2ABZ3qzQ0s — Darkfost (@Darkfost_Coc) May 16, 2025 Darkfost emphasized that this trend reflects increasing uncertainty among traders about Bitcoin’s short-term ability to reach new all-time highs. While long-term sentiment remains positive, the imbalance in derivatives activity highlights a cautious approach among participants. “It clearly reflects a growing sense of doubt among traders regarding Bitcoin’s ability to reach a new all-time high in the very short term,” he stated. “In such a context, the market loves to prove them wrong.” This sentiment-driven hesitation has slowed the pace of Bitcoin’s rally, even as it remains within striking distance of its January high. Bitcoin Technical Setup Hints at Bullish Continuation Meanwhile, technical analyst Javon Marks pointed to chart patterns suggesting a potential continuation of Bitcoin’s bullish trend. He highlighted the formation of a bull flag, a technical pattern often interpreted as a pause before the continuation of an upward movement. “Bitcoin looks to be bull flagging right under all-time highs. A breakout can send it above,” Marks wrote. Related Reading: Galaxy CEO Novogratz Sees Imminent Bitcoin Breakout To $130,000 If confirmed, this could signal renewed upward pressure and open the door for another leg higher. Additionally, Marks noted that altcoins are exhibiting similar behavior to previous market cycles, particularly the surges seen in 2017 and 2021. He suggested that the current phase may precede a broader altcoin rally, which historically tends to follow Bitcoin’s moves. Altcoins look to be moving similarly and right on track as it did in the 2017 and 2021 surges. The next phase looks to be where #Altcoins deliver the green light, or in other words push in their most bullish phases.

India is the world’s fourth-largest economy and a key buyer of many U.S. farm and tech goods. In an interview with Fox News host Bret Baier that aired Friday, Trump talked about trade relations with India with regard to improving U.S. exports. “They make it almost impossible to do business,” the president told Baier. “Do you know that they’re willing to cut 100 percent of their tariffs for the United States?” While making that claim, Trump offered mixed signals on how quickly a trade deal might follow. “That’ll come soon. I’m in no rush,” he said. “Look, everybody wants to make a deal with us.” He later added that he does not plan to “make deals with everybody.” The comments are the latest hint that the White House will continue to maintain tariffs on certain countries as a July pause on higher tariffs nears. Trump has said that the US will make decisions about unilateral tariffs for some nations. Earlier on Friday, the president told reporters he expects to announce fresh rates for trade partners “over the next two to three weeks.” Washington is prioritizing discussions with certain nations Officials say the administration wants to wrap up talks with several countries, including India, but limited staff and time mean Washington cannot hold full talks with every capital affected by the president’s reciprocal tariff plan. Trump also raised the idea of bigger trade ties with Pakistan, India’s rival. He previously said that trade was one major factor that helped broker a ceasefire deal between the two nuclear neighbors this month. “I’m using trade to settle scores and make peace,” he said. The United States has likewise worked to cool its clash with China. After talks last week, Washington cut its tariff rate on Chinese goods to 30 percent from 145 percent, while Beijing lowered its own tariffs on U.S. imports to 10 percent. “If I didn’t do that deal with China, I think China would have broken apart,” Trump said.

The chart, which visually maps Bitcoin’s historical cycles and future price targets, suggests a trajectory that could see Bitcoin reaching the million-dollar milestone between 2027 and 2029. This forecast is significant for Bitcoin holders and carries positive implications for other major cryptocurrencies, including XRP. Bitcoin is going to $1,000,000 pic.twitter.com/2yVwLTgvGK — Ash Crypto (@Ashcryptoreal) May 15, 2025 The Crypto Market’s Strong 2025 Performance XRP has already experienced substantial momentum in 2025. The asset began this journey in late 2024, rising from $0.55 in November to $3.39 in January. Bitcoin has also shown remarkable strength. The asset broke above $100,000 in December and rose to an all-time high of $109,114 in January. Bitcoin’s rise helped the broader market grow significantly, and with the asset on the rise again, altcoins are experiencing a resurgence. Like XRP, Bitcoin spent months struggling, but Donald Trump’s recent trade deal with the U.K. caused it to surge past $100,000 again. XRP also experienced a notable surge, rising to $2.6 for the first time since March. Analysts now predict that XRP could reach $4.5-$6 by June . Additionally, if Bitcoin remains around the same level for the rest of the year, the analysis suggests that XRP could rise to $12. If it reaches $250,000, XRP could climb to $30, more than 10x its current price of $2.38.

Supporting Indicators for a Bull Run Ash Crypto’s chart is not the only bullish signal for Bitcoin. April 2025 saw Bitcoin gain over 14%, marking its strongest monthly close since January. Technical indicators and macroeconomic conditions support further gains with the asset holding strong above $100,000. As one community member pointed out , Bitcoin only has to rise 10x to hit this $1 million target. As global adoption grows and institutions flood the market, Bitcoin’s chances to hit this target keep rising. If Bitcoin reaches $1 million in the coming years, XRP is well-positioned to capitalize on the ensuing market enthusiasm and institutional adoption.

44721753,https://nulltx.com/?p=149703,1747458725,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Bitcoin Faces Resistance at Key Levels, But Market Sentiment Suggests a Potential Rally",https://nulltx.com/bitcoin-faces-resistance-at-key-levels-but-market-sentiment-suggests-a-potential-rally/,"Bitcoin’s price has encountered some pushback over the last week, as the cryptocurrency has found it difficult to transcend the key price range of $104,000 to $105,000. This brief living-in-a-range period has made some Bitcoin traders evasively turn in the direction of bears. In the world of cryptocurrency trading, however, that old adage about how you do business can often lead to counterintuitive market moves. Therefore, what some are interpreting as a new bear phase for Bitcoin could just as easily be the set-up for the next leg up. Bitcoin has seen some resistance over the past week, being challenged to grow past the $104K to $105K level. This temporary ""pumping of the brakes"" has been enough to swing traders slightly bearish once again. Markets generally tend to move opposite to crowd's expectations,… pic.twitter.com/7toBDE5y6f — Santiment (@santimentfeed) May 15, 2025 Many are now left to ponder whether the recent Bitcoin price action has left its upward momentum halted for the time being or if this is just a momentary pause before Bitcoin breaks out again. Fear has crept back into the market. With it, a heightening of the probability of a crypto market surge has come about: This probability increase was born of the notion that the anxiety increase is beginning to signal a new market surge for Bitcoin and the crypto space at large. Crypto Markets Displaying Contrarian Sentiment A factor key to the current market uncertainty is a change in sentiment from bullish to bearish. When sentiment shifts in either direction very quickly, it can be a good indicator of where the market might be heading next. The way the market usually works is that prices move opposite of what the crowd seems to be expecting. In the case of Bitcoin, this recent shift to a more bearish crowd sentiment might actually set things up for another rally. One effective way to gauge market sentiment is to track the ratio of positive to negative social media mentions of cryptocurrencies. When this is done, a consistent slight bullish bias can be seen across platforms whenever crypto discussions heat up online. But this has been met with an equally strong bearish counterbalance. The fear and greed balance in the cryptocurrency market is crucial to understand, and what we know right now suggests it may not be tipping anywhere anytime soon. And that’s relevant because fear and greed is what we know drives the price of Bitcoin. Keeping an eye on these trends in social media allows investors a glimpse into the general sentiment of the market and how it may change in the near future. If fear is still the dominant sentiment and its divergence from greed is widening, this may be a signal that Bitcoin’s price is about to rise again—contrary to most traders’ expectations—because anytime fear is the dominant sentiment, that means we are at a market bottom. Institutional Inflows Highlight Continued Interest in Bitcoin Even with the recent pushback from Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency enjoys strong interest from institutional investors. On May 15, spot Bitcoin ETFs enjoyed a solid total net inflow of $115 million. That is obviously a sign that institutional interest remains strong, even with Bitcoin price movement having slowed somewhat, at least temporarily. It’s also interesting to note that of all the Bitcoin ETFs in the space, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) from BlackRock was the only one to record any sort of net inflow. On May 15 (ET), spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a total net inflow of $115 million, with BlackRock’s IBIT being the only ETF to record a net inflow. Spot Ethereum ETFs experienced a total net outflow of $39.7859 million, with BlackRock’s ETHA being the only one to post a net inflow.… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 16, 2025 What is particularly remarkable about the inflow into Bitcoin ETFs is that it is now the diaspora of traditional financial markets embracing cryptocurrencies and holding them in as many forms as the crypto product factories can dream up. While the European asset manager 21Shares and other players (like ProShare) were already issuing Bitcoin ETFs, the use of such vehicles is now Synonymous with the kind of hard-asset exposure that even Grayscale can’t quite offer, for now, to investors. Even BlackRock now gets you into Bitcoin as simply as can be done, with a fund whose inflows reflect the nearly miraculous mainstreaming of crypto. These institutional investments are critical to Bitcoin’s long-term growth. They supply much-needed liquidity and, just as importantly, serve as a validation for the asset’s adoption into the mainstream. While it might be stated that our current retail atmosphere hardly is a safe one, it seems clear that our institutions feel quite comfortable putting their money into Bitcoin. What’s Next for Bitcoin? Is a Rally Imminent? At present, the Bitcoin market appears to be suffering a temporary setback, but it does not currently signal a prolonged downturn. In recent days, Bitcoin has been stuck in what is between $104K to $105K, but this period is not without some increased trading-related fear. Fear is something we have to pay close attention to. When traders are this fearful and pessimistic, it very often means that what we are actually witnessing is a contrarian opportunity. When we are this fearful and pessimistic, what is actually happening is markets are setting themselves up to move in the opposite direction, which here seems to mean a potential bullish environment. Having deep-pocketed institutional investors pouring money into Bitcoin ETFs and continued mentions on social media showing a barely concealed bullish bias, it looks like the stage might be set for a Bitcoin rally sometime soon. It’s probably a good idea for traders and investors to monitor these developments closely. Based on the past, the way that crypto markets operate is quite clear. And now, that clarity is generating fear. With Bitcoin as the new Fear Index, we see the cryptocurrency space maturing before our eyes. With institutional investment in the Bitcoin Foundation, the next big patient play is sure to favor the upside. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

44721781,https://nulltx.com/?p=149702,1747458866,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Solana DEX Volumes Surge as Memecoin Trading Continues to Dominate,https://nulltx.com/solana-dex-volumes-surge-as-memecoin-trading-continues-to-dominate/,"Solana has a DEX , and in 2025 it started showing signs of recovery, with trading volume increasing to upwards of $6 billion per day in total volume traded. Of that, nearly $4 billion are in memecoins, which have long been a dominant color in the Solana ecosystem. Even with unending doubts about the staying power of memecoin trading, this type of trading has shown itself to be quite sturdy, adapting to—and sometimes leading—new trends and narratives. From late 2023 to early 2024, trades involving memecoins have provided between 40% and 70% of the total trading volume found on Solana DEXs. This kind of trading is far from the total collapse we seemed set for in 2022 and at the beginning of 2023, with trades found in Solana memecoins likely as safe as any trades found on centralized exchanges. Memecoins Drive DEX Growth, with PumpDotFun Leading the Charge Solana DEX volumes are experiencing a resurgence, and that revival is linked closely to trading “ memecoins .” A new player in this realm is @pumpdotfun, which seems to have quickly inflated to near the top of the Solana DEX leaderboard, commanding over 20% of DEX volume in recent weeks. @pumpdotfun features a unique bonding curve and automated market maker (AMM) functionality that have made it popular with users. This growth has not come without consequences, though, as it has seemingly and at least to some extent displaced @RaydiumProtocol in the DEX trading mix. Previously, Raydium held a commanding percentage of the Solana DEX market, accounting for as much as 60% of the total DEX volume. But the memecoin trading movement—taking place on platforms such as PumpDotFun—has blasted off and is now wrecking what’s left of the Solana DEX ecosystem. Raydium is not even mentioned as a key player in the latest segment of the Solana DEX ecosystem on DeFi Lama. Tokens like those traded on PumpDotFun represent an enduring sector on Solana: the memecoin. These offshoots of the meme economy reach obscene heights, and on Solana (as elsewhere), they are propped up by a few factors. High volatility lends them an aura of potential profitability, which attracts traders. Still, they maintain a decent amount of user engagement—because, at the end of the day, what are these tokens but a joke? A joke waiting to be told, retold, and riffed on, the surface reason why the value of these tokens might go up. What are trading memes if not a punchline? New Launchpads and Apps Stir the Market, Shifting Memecoin Market Share Though PumpDotFun has been the long-standing leader, newer projects and platforms are starting to make a big splash in Solana’s DEX landscape. AxiomExchange’s recent rise has been key to the overall increase in app activity across Solana, contributing 5-10% of total trading volume and about 15% of memecoin trading volume. This is a shift that shows the Solana ecosystem is becoming more diversified and that users are exploring a new set of applications and exchange platforms. Additionally, the excitement around memecoin projects and the appearance of new launchpads have turned up the competitive intensity. One notable instance comes from @RaydiumProtocol’s LaunchLab, which has been riding the coattails of @bonk_fun, a top-shelf memecoin that has driven attention and traffic to the platform. This instance illustrates the new-wave project fishing for momentum using the Solana DEX infrastructure to create a buzz around itself. Maybe the most amazing change has occurred with @MeteoraAG, whose market share has rocketed upward thanks to the rising enthusiasm around @believeapp. The roll-out of Believe has sparked fresh interest in the Solana memecoin scene, as the platform really leans into the Internet Capital Markets story. Over just a couple days, Meteora’s market share has blasted up to 25%, while PumpDotFun has seen a slight dip, moving from the mid-30s down to around 20%. 1/ Solana DEX volumes have recovered to mid-February levels, with daily total volumes crossing $6B and memecoin volumes back at nearly $4B. Despite constant remarks about the supposed ephemerality of memecoin trading, the sector has continuously adapted to new narratives. pic.twitter.com/y96FUSvj0E — defi_kay_ (@defi_kay_) May 15, 2025 This transformation highlights the increasing impact of new launchpads and applications within the Solana ecosystem, which are competing with long-established platforms like PumpDotFun. The latest narratives that are gathering momentum and the innovative projects that are in the vanguard of user attention mean that the market dynamics are changing with dizzying speed and that the Solana DEX sector retains a highly competitive and fluid character. Looking Ahead: A Competitive Landscape for Solana DEXs The reestablishment of volumes on Solana’s DEX to levels not seen since mid-February—thanks to the continuing memecoin craze—gives me hope that the Solana ecosystem can stage a comeback. Unlike at some other cryptocurrency exchanges, though, the Solid DEFI team reports relatively few problems with their products. Even the new apps coming onboard, like PumpDotFun, AxiomExchange, and Meteora, don’t seem to be having the kind of negative impact that—along with a decentralized governance proposal—that Raydium had on the market. So, it’s all good, right? Right. Especially, the rise of PumpDotFun has made it a key player in the memecoin sector, but now its dominance is being challenged by new launchpads and apps that are becoming influential. The competition between platforms like Raydium, Meteora, and AxiomExchange shows the development of Solana’s DEX ecosystem and suggests there are probably soon-to-be-released projects that are maintaining this ecosystem’s momentum. While the Solana decentralized exchange (DEX) sector is growing, it looks like one part of its ecosystem is maturing fast. Solana’s memecoins are doing an awful lot of heavy lifting for the blockchain’s DEX sector. Whether they are a passing fad or not, the memecoins seem to be here to stay for a while, and that can’t be anything but good for the Solana decentralized finance (DeFi) © space.

While Mizrachi didn’t share details about his discussions with Keiser and Herbert, the timing of the post came 11 days before the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, where Mizrachi is scheduled to speak. Source: Mayer Mizrachi The creation of a Bitcoin reserve in Panama City would follow a recently approved measure permitting the use of crypto for public payments, including taxes, fines and municipal fees. Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ether ( ETH ), Tether ( USDT ) and USDC ( USDC ) will be accepted once the crypto-to-fiat payment rails are established, Mizrachi said at the time. To push for a Bitcoin reserve at the federal level, Mizrachi would need to collaborate with Panama’s National Assembly to craft legislation. There’s no evidence to suggest that he has taken such measures. Mizrachi’s post follows the recent enactments of two Bitcoin reserve bills in the US states of Arizona and New Hampshire. Ukraine is also reportedly inching closer toward adopting Bitcoin as a national reserve asset, local media reported earlier in the month. Mizrachi, Keiser and Herbert discussed Bitcoin mining, education A post from Keiser suggests the trio spoke about how Panama and El Salvador can leverage renewable energy to bolster their Bitcoin mining operations. “Bitcoin is transforming Central America. El Salvador’s geothermal & Panama’s hydro-electric will power the Bitcoin revolution.” Herbert also noted that Panama City will integrate El Salvador’s “What is Money?” financial literacy textbook into its online library system. Related: Basel Medical shares down 15% on $1B Bitcoin buying plans Keiser and Herbert have played a crucial role in crafting El Salvador’s Bitcoin policy, which includes a Bitcoin reserve consisting of 6,179 Bitcoin ( BTC ), worth nearly $640 million.

Just today, Abraxas swung for the fences and acquired 67.6K ETH for about $175 million on Binance. That purchase brought its total for the recent stretch—what we now know to be a very bullish accumulation phase that started on May 7—to 278,639 ETH worth around $724 million. This is a not-so-quiet push into Ethereum from a firm that we’ve now got on our watchlist. Abraxas Capital is slowly becoming Microstrategy for Ethereum. Just today, it bought 67.6K ETH worth $175 million on Binance. Since May 7th, Abraxas Capital has bought a total of 278,639 ETH worth $724 million. This is their strategy for buying more ETH • Buy ETH on… pic.twitter.com/ulysUVLmUf — Ito Shimotsuma (@ItoShimotsuma) May 16, 2025 By making these impressive acquisitions, Abraxas Capital has emerged as a key player in Ethereum’s future. Moreover, it has doubled down on its belief that the cryptocurrency has long-term value. This high-stakes strategy has many in the crypto community talking and wondering: Is Abraxas Capital becoming the “MicroStrategy of Ethereum”? The Strategy Behind Abraxas Capital’s Ethereum Purchases Abraxas Capital’s method of accumulating Ethereum is a unique and bold one, signaling their belief that Ethereum’s value will continue to rise. Their strategy revolves around a cycle of buying ETH, leveraging it on decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, and then using the borrowed funds to buy even more ETH. Here’s how the process works: 1. Acquiring ETH on Exchanges: Abraxas Capital starts off by acquiring Ethereum on centralized exchanges such as Binance. This method enables the firm to rapidly build up substantial amounts of ETH at rates that are very competitive. 2. Lending on AAVE: After buying ETH, Abraxas Capital lends the tokens on AAVE, a decentralized lending platform. This allows the firm to earn interest on its holdings while, at the same time, borrowing stablecoins like USDT (Tether). 3. Purchasing Additional ETH with USDT from the Lending Protocol: The USDT that was lent from the previous step is used to buy even more ETH. By using borrowed funds to make purchases, Abraxas Capital is increasing not just the quantity of ETH in its possession but also, and perhaps more importantly, the institution’s exposure to the asset. By consistently utilizing this strategy, Abraxas Capital seeks to amass a substantial holding in Ethereum over time. This tactic is akin to that of MicroStrategy in the Bitcoin arena, where it used debt to fund its Bitcoin buys and secure a commanding position in the asset. The Present Market and Ethereum ETF Developments Despite BlackRock’s ETH ETF being the only fund with net inflows, current Ethereum sentiment & net outflows don’t seem super bullish. While Abraxas Capital has been making waves in the Ethereum market, the overall Ethereum market sentiment is not so chill right now. On May 15, the total amount pulled out of Ethereum ETFs totaled nearly $40 million (specifically, $39.7859 million). That’s a lot of dosh to be pulling out of not just one fund but several. And while it’s always a bit concerning for a market when the entities in it being funded are experiencing withdrawals, this seems particularly worrisome given that institutional investors are behind ETF products. The outflows from Ethereum ETFs occur when many are still assessing the long-term outlook for the asset. Although traditional finance (TradFi) and institutional investors have begun to warm to Ethereum through ETFs, there still appears to be a healthy sense of caution, due to not only ongoing market volatility but also a number of still-open regulatory questions. All that said, the apparent growth of BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF suggests that institutional interest in Ethereum remains fairly strong, with many investors seeing it as a vehicle with which to access a still-nascent, potentially rapidly growing Ethereum ecosystem. On May 15 (ET), spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a total net inflow of $115 million, with BlackRock’s IBIT being the only ETF to record a net inflow. Spot Ethereum ETFs experienced a total net outflow of $39.7859 million, with BlackRock’s ETHA being the only one to post a net inflow.… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 16, 2025 The aggressive manner in which Abraxas Capital has been gathering ETH could well reflect an ample amount of confidence in Ethereum’s future as a lucrative investment vehicle. Abraxas is virtually swimming against the current when it comes to investor sentiment. While traditional markets show a profusion of signals that range from mildly optimistic to decidedly pessimistic, this investment firm is funneling huge sums into Ethereum. Publicly available information suggests that over 1.1 million ETH have been accumulated, worth some $2.8 billion today. By any definition, that’s a substantial investment. A Growing Influence in Ethereum’s Future While Abraxas Capital is heftily loading up on Ethereum (ETH), the firm is starting to make a name for itself as a serious player in the Ethereum ecosystem. In just the latest week and change, Abraxas has now plopped down roughly $724 million on a number of purchases of ETH, and this most recent acquisition seems more pronounced, heavier, than anything we’ve quite seen yet in terms of a firm coming into Ethereum and making a big statement. This is quite impactful, indeed. But why would its be quite impactful? What sort of might an ETH acquisition of this size have on the market? Abraxas Capital’s strategy of participating in decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms to leverage its substantial Ethereum holdings signals something even bolder: a deeper integration with the systems of decentralized finance. When the firm participates in DeFi lending, it is doing much more than attempting to increase exposure to Ethereum as a result of a bullish view on the cryptocurrency. Abraxas Capital is reinforcing, with its dollars and decision-making, the ecosystem that Ethereum powers. Abraxas Capital’s approach is similar to that of MicroStrategy in the Bitcoin market, where the company has piled up a huge Bitcoin reserve by leveraging its balance sheet. This strategy has made MicroStrategy a key player in the Bitcoin space, and it might well be that Abraxas Capital similarly becomes a significant player in the Ethereum ecosystem. Abraxas Capital’s commitment to the network could play a compelling role in driving future growth and adoption as Ethereum continues to expand and evolve. The firm’s aggressive investment strategy conveys a strong message of confidence in Ethereum’s long-term value. And its presence might encourage other institutional investors to adopt a similar playbook. To conclude, the actions and strategy of Abraxas Capital serve as a reminder of the institutional interest in Ethereum. This asset may be shaping up to have a very bright future, possibly taking EIP-1559 and the upcoming Ethereum Merge as two main catalysts adhering to that theory. Should more firms follow the lead of Abraxas Capital and show interest in Ethereum, the very practicality of the platform might see some sort of mainstream adoption.

Recent hacks, including a $1.4 billion breach at Bybit , highlight growing threats, with $2.2 billion stolen in 2024 alone. Coinbase is now battling a lawsuit over alleged data lapses and has refused to pay a $20 million ransom, instead offering the same amount as a bounty. While Coinbase fell victim to this social engineering attack, Binance and Kraken managed to stop similar attempts before any damage was done. A new Bloomberg report reveals how these exchanges stayed a step ahead. What Happened at Coinbase? Coinbase revealed in a recent SEC filing that hackers tricked some offshore customer service agents into giving access to certain user data and account records. The attackers reportedly offered bribes to these employees. Although no passwords, private keys, or user funds were stolen, the breach is expected to cost Coinbase up to $400 million . This includes reimbursements and cleanup efforts. To track down those behind the attack, Coinbase is even offering a $20 million reward. Same Tactics Used on Binance and Kraken According to Bloomberg, Binance and Kraken were targeted by the same kind of phishing scheme. Hackers tried to reach out to customer service agents via Telegram and asked for sensitive information like account balances and home addresses. But unlike Coinbase, these two exchanges didn’t suffer any data leaks. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : U.S.-Registered Xinbi Guarantee Linked to $8.4 Billion in Illegal Activity , How Binance and Kraken Stayed Safe Thanks to strong internal security systems, Binance and Kraken were able to detect the suspicious activity early. Their AI tools flagged the phishing attempts before any employee gave up information. This quick response helped protect users and avoid any data loss. Still a Wake-Up Call for Crypto Platforms Even though Binance and Kraken came out safe, the incident is a reminder of how serious social engineering threats have become. Hackers are no longer just targeting systems, they’re targeting people. Exchanges must stay alert, especially when it comes to third-party service providers. This latest string of phishing attacks shows that the crypto industry still has work to do in protecting users. While Coinbase deals with the aftermath, Binance and Kraken’s strong defense sets a good example for others to follow. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

While Ethereum once ruled the roost, new contenders like BNB Chain, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base are making noticeable gains. Each chain seems to have enjoyed its own distinct set of growth spurts, periods of stagnation, and brush with market leadership, giving us a good picture of an evolving DeFi and crypto ecosystem. In this environment that’s changing with great rapidity, Ethereum remains in many ways a commanding presence in the market, even if it’s lost a little bit of dominance. Meanwhile, chains like BNB Chain and Base have emerged to challenge Ethereum in the embedded swap space, to some degree. Here’s a closer look at how each of these chains is performing in that market. Ethereum: From Dominance to a Resilient Core Player For a long time, the DeFi ecosystem has hinged on Ethereum. DeFi accounted for nearly 100% of all the sockets in Ethereum until March 2021, but that was never a totally comfortable situation. For one thing, Ethereum is expensive. Those sockets don’t come cheap, and the actual interface implementations are rarely simple or straightforward. Gas fees on Ethereum can change dramatically from hour to hour or even minute to minute, making it a really bad time to be doing a swap when you’ll be basically swapping in order to pay for the swap. Notably, even though its share of the market has decreased to about 20%, Ethereum is still a key player when it comes to trading and settlement inside the network. Its trading volume hit a peak of $10 billion in 2021, but by 2023 it had dropped down to only $200 million weekly. Still, Ethereum is rallying again in 2025, with its trading volume recovering to $2 billion per week. All this adds up to about a 40% share of all trading activity happening inside the network right now. BNB Chain: Unstoppable Growth with a Surge in Market Share The last few years have been quite consistent and impressive for BNB Chain, as they have brought consistent and impressive growth. In 2021, BNB Chain was doing solidly, with an impressive swap count of 2 million weekly swaps. By 2025, however, we had surged to an impressive 15 million swaps per week on BNB Chain. When audits are included, we had exceeded 15 million weekly swaps in 2025. This growth has also led to considerable fluctuations in our market share. In 2021 and 2022, BNB Chain’s market share of embedded swaps reached its zenith at 70% , clearly in the commanding position of this emerging space. Although this share dipped slightly in 2023, its recovery since that year has been remarkable; by 2025, it had swelled to an even better-than-before share of greater than 60%. BNB Chain’s overall share of trading volume, though, has remained relatively modest; what can we ascribe its absence from the top of that leaderboard to? This trajectory—bumping past the Peg and aha moment and headed for the Pragma Si milestone—positions BNB Chain as a legit contender in the EVM space. Its rise to this moment in time, backed by increasing average daily users and total value locked in, suggests that decentralized finance investors are leaning heavily toward this chain. Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base: Shifting Dynamics Among Emerging Players Arbitrum and Optimism have also played important parts in the growth of decentralized finance, though they have seen different levels of success. Arbitrum, a top DeFi chain, seized 20% of swap share in early 2023, with its peak weekly volume hitting $600 million in April 2024. Although its swap count has since dropped to somewhere between 500,000 and 1 million weekly swaps, Arbitrum has remained in the top three for capital inflow in the DeFi space. On the contrary, swap shares have felt the direct impact of optimism to a much lesser degree. A modest number of 10,000 weekly swaps in 2022 had a more direct impact on Impressions, but from there, the swaps only grew in count. By April of 2025, that figure had swelled to a number in and around 70,000. Even at those much-improved counts, the influence of this layer on the swap market is still, at best, minimal. The peak (of either Impressions or swaps) reaches only a rounding-error number of $50 million Paxos dollars. To speak of Base is to speak of one of the most promising emerging chains. Having launched only in 2024, Base has already made a splash, with a weekly swaps count that reached 4.5 million by April 2025. Those numbers position Base at the center of the activity in the EVM space—that is, among chains compatible with Ethereum’s virtual machine—and with what’s happening on Ethereum itself, accounting for approximately 20% of total swap counts and from 10-25% of total trading volumes. Base has itself become a playground for swaps, and what’s driving those swaps is largely the activity surrounding memecoins, asset tokenization, and new, innovative DeFi-CeFi lending integrations, including the integration between Base and the Coinbase-Morpho protocol. So if there’s anything that’s a true breakout development in the Ethereum space in 2025, it’s gotta be Base. Conclusion: A Fragmented Yet Thriving Ecosystem The swap trends seen across Ethereum and other EVM Chains are a clear indicator of how fast the blockchain and DeFi markets are moving at the moment. Even though it has shown a steady decline in its market share, Ethereum is still a top contender in this space. Meanwhile, BNB Chain has been showing an impressive and steady growth trajectory, with its own ecosystem expanding very nicely. At the same time, newer players in this segment—like Base, for instance—are catching up pretty quickly, while Arbitrum and Optimism are also doing their part to maintain this diverse market landscape. The blockchain arena keeps moving forward. Intense competition now exists among EVM chains. New chains are capturing market share—sometimes through the innovative solutions they offer. In this environment, Ethereum itself is under challenge, both from new competitors and from new technological developments in its own ecosystem. If this competition is happening at the level of chains, what about at the level of Layer 2s? Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

In the AI Agent market overall, the last 24 hours have seen a slight stabilization at a valuation of $10.8 billion, which reflects a dip of about 0.45%. But even with that dip, mindshare for the Virtuals ecosystem has seen a substantial uptick—it reached a record 39.41%. That uptick memorializes a noteworthy performance divergence across the Virtuals space. Emerging projects and tokens are seeing a ton of action. By contrast, the larger, more established tokens aren’t really going much of anywhere. They’re effectively treading water. The ongoing rotation in the market has seen sizable advances in smaller-cap projects, with tokens like RWAI, POLY, SQDGN, AURA, and BIOS making headway with double-digit percentage gains. But the retracement we’ve seen in the overall market, especially within the flagship $VIRTUAL token—which has declined by nearly 5% in the last 24 hours—is a harbinger of just how volatile the world of AI and crypto is these days. AI Agent Sector Maintains Stability Despite Capital Rotation The AI Agent sector is a key part of the Virtuals ecosystem and hasn’t seen much movement in the past 24 hours; it’s still holding at a $10.8 billion valuation, which pretty much amounts to a 0.45% loss—nothing to panic about. Holders of AI Agents should maintain their composure; this sector remains a relatively stable and resilient area of investment under the current market conditions. In this case, capital rotation pertains to the transfer of capital from larger-cap projects into tokens that are smaller and more speculative. This has caused some of the major tokens in the AI Agent market, like $VIRTUAL, to see a drop in their prices while smaller tokens have enjoyed some significant upward movement in their prices. As a result, the total market cap for the Virtuals ecosystem itself has dropped by 1.05% to about $2.27 billion. While this drop is evident, the mindshare expansion to 39.41% suggests that market participants are increasingly paying attention to Virtuals and the growth narrative adjacent to the ecosystem. Small Caps Surge as Major Tokens See Retracements While the larger market has taken some steps backward, the small-cap tokens inside the Virtuals ecosystem are enjoying a major upturn in fortunes. The names that stand out over the last 24 hours include RWAI, POLY, SQDGN, AURA, and BIOS, which have each bettered their previous all-time highs with growth numbers of between 22% and more than 41%. RWAI (@RWAIagent) is up a commanding 41.25%, a clear sign that investors are hot on the trail of AI-powered solutions with clear niches in the ecosystem. POLY (@polytraderAI), an AI trading bot protocol, seems to have captured the imagination of those looking for innovative decentralized trading systems, as its price is up 23.97%. SQDGN (@helloSQDGN) is also seeing a very impressive run, as its price is up 22.79%, and there’s clear interest in its unique setup. AURA (@AurraCloud) and BIOS (@BasisOS) are both up a solid 22%, and there’s very clear interest in the kinds of AI-focused virtual world projects they are running. Virtuals Daily Update | May 16th, 2025 Stay up to date on all news from the @virtuals_io ecosystem over the last 24 hours… pic.twitter.com/m12BQkdJN1 — Graeme (@gkisokay) May 16, 2025 These smaller-cap tokens are seeing a rise, which can be viewed as a shift in investor sentiment. Traders and investors seem to be diversifying and allocating funds into up-and-coming projects with high growth potential. Meanwhile, the larger tokens, like $VIRTUAL, have faced retracements. Those are attracting increasing attention for a healthy, active ecosystem of innovation. Virtuals Mindshare Soars Amidst Market Rotations The Virtuals ecosystem is seeing an incredibly rapid rise in recognition and engagement. It is now at an all-time high of 39.41%. In the past 24 hours, the rise was 5.12%. If recognition and engagement continue at even close to this rate, we are going to see some very nice things happening in the not-so-distant future. This upsurge in the attention given to Virtuals indicates that even though the main tokens are experiencing a retracement, people are paying a lot more attention and are a lot more engaged with the broader ecosystem of Virtuals. What used to be a few smaller projects out in the woods is now a lot brighter, and a lot more people are coming to play. Attention isn’t investment, and it sure as hell doesn’t guarantee any growth, but it is possible that the much-maligned “mindshare” could lead somewhere. Conclusion: A Mixed Landscape with Signs of Growth The Virtuals ecosystem continues to develop amidst a cocktail of pullbacks and advances that provide us with an up-to-date portrait of the current market dynamics. The AI Agent sector remains firm, displaying a $10.8 billion valuation level, and the momentum is holding here despite what seem like slight pullbacks. Meanwhile, small-cap tokens within the Virtuals ecosystem are experiencing massive surges within the last month that are signaling some kind of healthy appetite for innovation and new projects. Investors need to be conscious of the changing dynamics in the market as it continues to rotate. The ecosystem is attracting a lot of attention, which is a good sign and could be taken to mean that Virtuals is on its way to being a long-term growth story. The problem, though, is that as the bigger tokens—like $VIRTUAL—pull back, it raises a red flag about the overall health of the crypto sector. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

44722025,https://nulltx.com/?p=149699,1747459439,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Long-Term Bitcoin Holders Increase Accumulation Amid Institutional Shifts,https://nulltx.com/long-term-bitcoin-holders-increase-accumulation-amid-institutional-shifts/,"The journey of Bitcoin keeps drawing attention, and recent activities in the market suggest a certain trend. Long-term holders are in a clear accumulation phase of Bitcoin. This movement, which started in late March 2025, reflects something that is happening in the market more broadly. Institutional players and traditional financial firms are starting to take on a bigger role in the story of Bitcoin. BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF has now surpassed its Strategy ETF in terms of how much Bitcoin it holds. Clearly, traditional finance (TradFi) and the world of cryptocurrencies are becoming ever more closely linked. Long-Term Holders Actively Accumulate Bitcoin The Long-Term Holders indicator shows that they’ve been actively accumulating $BTC since the end of March. The last notable accumulation by this group occurred between August and October 2024, when #Bitcoin was trading at local lows… pic.twitter.com/n85LcELr42 — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) May 15, 2025 The increasing presence of institutional capital in the crypto space brings with it three big changes: a fresh narrative about Bitcoin, a new market structure around this and other crypto assets, and, it must be said, an increased risk of centralization. In the midst of all this, it’s certainly easy, if not always accurate, to view the presence of Wall Street in the Bitcoin market as a big step toward the latter’s legitimization as a part of the financial system. Long-Term Holders Are Accumulating Bitcoin Again The Long-Term Holders indicator is a key metric for tracking the activity of Bitcoin’s most dedicated investors. It has recently revealed something interesting: since late March 2025, long-term holders of Bitcoin have been not just buying, but accumulating large amounts of the cryptocurrency. And this pattern of accumulation is now so pronounced that it merits talking about. So what has the Long-Term Holders indicator revealed about recent activity among this group of privileged Bitcoin holders? From August to October 2024, the price of Bitcoin reached a vital moment. Many market players were divided—some expected a significant rally, others, a breakdown. After the U.S. presidential election, in which Donald Trump emerged victorious, the price of Bitcoin shot upward, sending many into a bull market frenzy. What we see now with Bitcoin’s accumulation pattern is something entirely different from a market breakdown. This is a situation where long-term holders of Bitcoin signal to the rest of us that they now consider the price to be undervalued. And these signalers, in our more patient and volatile future, are much more likely to maintain the status quo. The increase in activity from long-term holders comes just as Bitcoin has gained a lot of respect from big institutions. There is clear interest in the asset from both retail and institutional investors, and their almost unanimous confidence in Bitcoin’s future is becoming pronounced. Shareholders in both camps are apparently quite content to not sell their Bitcoin even as the price lately has been pushed down. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Signals Institutional Dominance One of the most significant events in the Bitcoin market has been the growing dominance of BlackRock in Bitcoin ETF holdings. BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF recently passed its Strategy ETF in Bitcoin holdings, reaching an impressive amount of around $64.7 billion, compared to $59.1 billion in its Strategy ETF. BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF just surpassed Strategy in BTC holdings — now valued at ~$64.7B vs $59.1B Three key implications emerge: 1⃣ TradFi is taking over the Bitcoin narrative 2⃣ BTC market structure is shifting 3⃣ Centralization risk is growing Also today: Abu… pic.twitter.com/elf6NqXUrT — Followin (@followin_io) May 16, 2025 One of the biggest players of the traditional financial world, BlackRock, has long occupied a central role in financial markets and how they are shaped. Its involvement with Bitcoin clearly sends the signal that traditional finance is taking a much more pronounced role in this new asset class. BlackRock’s lot in life is to gather assets in as many ways as it can count. That it would consider Bitcoin a viable asset class for gathering assets is something that should not be lost on anyone. This milestone underscores the trend of institutional capital moving into Bitcoin via products like ETFs that are heavily regulated. These vehicles give traditional investors a means of getting Bitcoin exposure without having to directly buy and hold it. The ETF conversation, then, is really a Bitcoin conversation, and it’s a sign of the cryptocurrency’s increasing acceptance in mainstream finance. The Risks of Centralization and Shifting Market Dynamics Legitimizing Bitcoin by involving institutions in the cryptocurrency’s realm is all well and good, but is in-principle legitimization by the involvement of institutions not bad for the cryptocurrency’s long-standing, if not dodgy, image of a decentralization miracle? Indeed, as more big-money players and hooded figures from the world of finance storm into the Bitcoin castle, they grow, in something of a paradox, the castle’s image of a place under siege and its real image of decentralization—with the increasing rumblings in Street and public fears of summit, open-hijacking, and plummet-to-Earth potential for a Bitcoin that is centralized in the minds real-deal finance sees as achieving legitimacy, and thus great tolerability, to the go-go world of an offshore investment haven. A few big institutions that are players in the Bitcoin market possibly can, and probably do, create risks for the little retail investors who are buying Bitcoin. This is true especially if a controlling interest in a majority of Bitcoin is held not by individual investors (as would be the case in a truly decentralized system) but by large, institutional players (as might the very recent trend suggest). What happens when a small number of big institutions control a large enough piece of a supposedly decentralized pie? And what happens when those institutions wield enough money to influence the market without any real influence over what’s supposed to be a decentralized future for the Bitcoin system? This trend towards centralization is observable not just in the advent of Bitcoin ETFs but also in the increasing involvement of massive international institutional investors. For example, Mubadala, the sovereign wealth fund of Abu Dhabi, recently revealed that it has taken a position in BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, amassing around 8.727 million shares worth close to $410 million. This is a very strong signal that traditional institutions from all over are now entering the Bitcoin market through the ETF route and, by doing so, are embracing Bitcoin as a really mainstream kind of asset. Conclusion: A New Era for Bitcoin The recent activity in the Bitcoin market reflects a significant shift, with long-term investors accumulating Bitcoin and institutional players gaining increasing influence. While Bitcoin itself shows continued resilience and growth, the means by which it achieves those ends—and the market’s overall structure—are undergoing changes that could have lasting impacts on the precursors to its decentralization. With BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF now at the forefront, and global institutions like Mubadala indicating their commitment to Bitcoin, it’s clear that traditional finance is not just accepting Bitcoin as a legitimate asset but is also energetically moving to shape its future. This is undoubtedly a moment of fascinating possibilities—yet also potential risks, especially where centralization is concerned. As Bitcoin becomes ever more an asset governed by institutions, it’s something that we will all have to navigate. Bitcoin is growing in an increasingly solid global financial landscape, but its future role still seems quite uncertain. It might function more and more like a traditional asset, but it might also keep up its pretense of being a decentralized peer-to-peer currency. Or it might push up the walls of that pretend stage and suck in the peer-to-peer society that’s its only real customer. One thing is certain: Bitcoin’s story isn’t just the story of Bitcoin anymore.

44722102,https://nulltx.com/?p=149698,1747459617,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,FTX’s Costly Early Exits: A $7.6 Billion Missed Opportunity,https://nulltx.com/ftxs-costly-early-exits-a-7-6-billion-missed-opportunity/,"FTX , which was once a prominent player in the cryptocurrency sector, still shows signs of basic errors that have contributed to its collapse. One of the most apparent blunders was selling too soon its early-stage, high-potential partnership investments. Those decisions have likely set the exchange back to the tune of billions in unrealized gains (the crypto community is now left to wonder if these were really “partnership” decisions made under pressure or just plain dumb moves). Key FTX Restructuring Outcomes for Customers 1. FTX estate sold numerous investments for far less than their worth. 2. Potential upside missed by FTX = $7.6 billion. 3. Repaid to customers so far = $1.2 billion. 4. Amount to be repaid, stated by FTX, = $14.7 billion to $16.5 billion. Anysphere: A $200K Exit from a $9B Rocket One of the most missed notable opportunities for FTX was its early investment in Anysphere, the company behind Cursor AI. In 2022, Alameda, FTX’s trading firm, invested a modest $200K into Anysphere. At the time, it seemed a small gamble for a potentially big payoff. By April 2023, however, the estate of FTX sold the stake for the same amount—just $200K—seemingly writing off any future potential. By 2025, Anysphere had raised $900 million and had a valuation of a staggering $9 billion. FTX’s initial $200,000 investment would now be worth an estimated $500 million. And from that, you get this: 50x for Anysphere; 2.5x profit for FTX; and a missed opportunity on Anysphere’s first round of funding that had us recoup investors’ funds instead of bagging life-changing profits. Sui: A Missed $3.55 Billion from Mysten Labs A further notable instance of FTX’s exit strategy became evident in its interactions with Mysten Labs and the $SUI token. In 2022, FTX funneled a $101 million check into Mysten’s Series B funding round, obtaining both equity and around 890 million $SUI tokens as part of the arrangement. At the time, it appeared to be a solid investment, with these tokens set to capitalize on the burgeoning DeFi ecosystem. In April 2023, however, FTX’s estate sold off its whole position, for $96.2 million—a loss of $4.8 million compared to the price it paid for the tokens. By May 2025, $SUI was trading at about $4 a token. That surge in value turned FTX’s missed investment opportunity into something that could have plumped up its estate with an additional $3.55 billion. Who knows—maybe investors could have bought some really nice shelters for that kind of cash. Selling this position looks even more regrettable now, especially when you consider how much $SUI could keep going up if and when Mysten Labs really makes a name for itself in the blockchain space. Anthropic: $500M Bet Sold Too Soon The investment in Anthropic, the artificial intelligence company behind Claude AI, was perhaps the most painful loss for FTX. In 2021, FTX bought an 8% stake in the company for $500 million, banking on the promise of artificial intelligence to deliver outsized returns. By 2023, FTX’s estate was selling its stake in Anthropic—and doing so for a total of $1.33 billion. A year later, Anthropic has become super valuable, with its worth rocketing to an astounding $61.5 billion. If FTX had held on to its 8 percent piece of that worth, it would now be sitting on an asset worth an estimated $4.92 billion—an amount that is $3.59 billion more than what FTX realized from the sale of its Anthropic stake. Anthropic’s swift ascent, powered by the increasing allure of AI technologies, highlights FTX’s lost chance, particularly when you consider that Anthropic’s valuation keeps rising in lockstep with AI’s growing importance on the global tech and finance stage. FTX fumbled the bag. Three times over. Anysphere (Cursor AI) recently raised $900M, more than tripling its valuation. FTX had an early stake… and sold it for $200K. Today it’s worth ~$500M. That was just one of 3 early exits that cost them ~$7.6B. Here’s what happened pic.twitter.com/z13TtK7DZd — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) May 15, 2025 Conclusion: A Strategic Move Under Pressure or a Rushed Mistake? The trio of early exits—Anysphere, Sui, and Anthropic—calls to mind the many possibilities FTX could have realized had it just held on to its positions. The combined total of these three developments amounts to $7.64 billion, which, had it been realized during the period in which FTX was attempting to emerge from bankruptcy, could have done a lot to help boost creditor recoveries and significantly change the narrative regarding FTX’s image. Looking back, we can see that these weren’t just normal investment screw-ups. The quick sell-offs, mainly due to how much they could have earned, beg the question: were they An impulsive choice, made under pressure? Or were they nasty, strategic moves done to cover for the company’s obvious financial instability? Whatever the case, they were some of the most expensive mistakes in FTX’s short, wild history. As FTX progresses with its restructuring, these not-so-missed opportunities offer a cautionary tale about the high-risk, high-reward crypto world we’re in. Imagining—because that’s all we can do since FTX is in no position to say otherwise—what the outcome might have been had FTX held onto these assets makes for an equally unreal and ridiculously lucrative picture of crypto history.

44722183,https://nulltx.com/?p=149697,1747459787,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Mantle and Sui Gain Ground in Stablecoin Transfer Size as Ethereum, Tron Dominate in Usage",https://nulltx.com/mantle-and-sui-gain-ground-in-stablecoin-transfer-size-as-ethereum-tron-dominate-in-usage/,"The stablecoin transaction world is moving quickly, and new data offers a surprising look at how various blockchain networks are being employed to transfer value. Notably, while Ethereum and Tron continue to fulfill the roles of primary network and infrastructure providers, newer entities such as Mantle and Sui are quickly distinguishing themselves, especially when average stablecoin transaction sizes are considered. Stablecoin adoption keeps on expanding, recently reported statistics from CrytoRank and SentoraHQ state. However, while each network is clearly making strides, the CryptoRank and SentoraHQ reports highlight that these networks are doing so in different ways. Some show more strength in transaction volume. Others show more strength in transfer size. Still, others show strength in user base, which in this case is represented by the number of user addresses. Ethereum Leads in Transfer Size, Base and Tron in Pursuit Ethereum remains the leader in terms of the average stablecoin transfer size. The network logs a stunning average of $68,000 per transaction, which places it heads and shoulders above the other networks in this regard. That figure suggests that Ethereum is still very much the layer-1 network of choice for high-value users, institutions, and DeFi protocols. Following closely behind is Base, a Layer 2 solution developed by Coinbase. It has managed to secure a strong place in the market with an average transaction size of $20,000, which is quite incredible for a relatively new solution. Tron, which is best known for its ultra-low transaction fees and efficiency, ranks next with an average of $8,900 in stablecoin transfers. Mantle and Sui lead in stablecoins transaction size Ethereum firmly holds the lead with an average stablecoin transaction size of $68K. @base ($20K) and @trondao ($8.9K) also rank among the top performers. Interestingly, @Mantle_Official ($6.8K) and @SuiNetwork ($5.8K) have… pic.twitter.com/o6XEiqCLnA — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) May 15, 2025 Nonetheless, what stands out most in the latest report is the emergence of Mantle and Sui, two blockchain networks that have quietly eclipsed more established players like Optimism and Arbitrum when it comes to average transaction size. Mantle registers $6,800, while Sui comes in close at $5,800—both of which surpass several other well-known Layer 2 and alternative Layer 1 networks. Mantle and Sui Outpace Optimism and Arbitrum in Transfer Volume per Transaction Mantle and Sui have only recently stepped into the limelight, but their performance is impressive. Both networks now have a steadily upward trend in average transaction size, which is a clear indicator that users feel more and more comfortable handling larger sums on the platforms. Mantle and Sui might be succeeding because they both have efficient transaction throughput, competitive gas fees, and growing developer ecosystems. But what’s really going on? Mantle and Sui are signaling a user behavior shift. They are by no means the first to signal something like this, but they are the first in a while to kind of plow ahead of Optimism and Arbitrum, which were once the prime competitors in this space and were long considered very solid parts of Ethereum’s Layer 2 scaling strategy. Users seem more and more willing to try out alternative chains that do, in fact, offer similar kinds of benefits to what those Layer 2 parts were offering. Segueing into another part of the user behavior shift, though, is that users really don’t seem to care too much, or aren’t concerned at all, about what they might have to do to get to those alternative chains. The presence of decentralized finance platforms and their high-yield protocols could be leading to development of larger transaction volumes from active traders and institutions across both networks. Whether this influx of cash is sustainable or merely a flash in the pan remains to be seen. Tron Dominates USDT Adoption with Unmatched Volume and User Base While Ethereum may lead in value per transaction, Tron continues to be the dominant network in terms of total USDT volume and user adoption. According to SentoraHQ, Tron processed a staggering $623.9 billion in stablecoin volume over the past 30 days. This is a testament to its role as the preferred network for USDT transactions, particularly in regions where low fees are critical. Tron is the most widely used network for USDT, processing $623.9 Billion in volume in the past 30 days. And with over 57 million USDT addresses on TRON, it accounts for more than 3 quarters of all USDT addresses. https://t.co/PquYZkmebs pic.twitter.com/vLNNckGxMn — Sentora (previously IntoTheBlock) (@SentoraHQ) May 16, 2025 In addition, Tron accommodates more than 57 million USDT addresses, which makes up over 75% of all active USDT addresses in the world. This colossal user base illustrates Tron’s exceptional standing as a network that’s friendly to retail transactions. More than any other network, Tron is a place where everyday payments, cross-border transactions, and peer-to-peer transfers—especially the kinds of transactions that developing markets carry out—take place. The efficiency, high throughput, and minimal fees of Tron have made it the choice for speed and cost-effectiveness in the movement of stablecoins—especially in transactions outside the traditional banking system. Conclusion The stablecoin environment keeps diversifying, with each blockchain network claiming its own space. Ethereum is still the best for value transfers, while Tron can’t be touched for volume and adoption. Yet those newer networks, like Mantle and Sui, are quickly coming into their own with competitive transaction sizes. This trend underscores an increasingly fragmented—and specialized—blockchain ecosystem. Users and developers pick platforms that suit their specific needs, be it scalability, transaction costs, or yield. In this fast-moving environment, watching the emerging players may give us hints about the next big winners in stablecoin infrastructure. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Some analysts suggest that new highs are bound to come if the token holds above a crucial level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Next Leg Up Loading? Analyst Says BTC Could Trade Sideways For Two Weeks Dogwifhat Reclaims $1.00 Over the past month, dogwifhat has seen a massive 190% surge, climbing back to the $1.00 barrier. The memecoin has been in a downtrend since hitting its Q4 2024 high of $4.19 in November, retracing over 92% in five months. After the TRUMP memecoin and LIBRA token controversial launches, the sector faced market exhaustion, with most memecoins struggling during the Q1 2025 retraces. As a result, WIF lost the $1.00 mark for the first time in a year. Amid last month’s pullbacks, dogwifhat hit a 14-month low of $0.32 before the crypto market recovery started, but jumped to the $0.60 support at the end of April. Since then, WIF has soared over 70%, reclaiming the key $1.00 resistance on Monday. This week, the memecoin has hovered between the $1.00-$1.20 price range after hitting a three-month high of $1.32 four days ago. Additionally, it retested the recently reclaimed level as support after bouncing from the $0.95 level on Thursday. Market watcher Rose Premium shared a technical outlook for the cryptocurrency, noting a bullish structure after its recent performance. The trader explained that dogwifhat shows “a classic bullish structure after rebounding from the Fibo Zone,” between the $0.95-$0.98 range. Based on this, WIF’s trend continuation is likely if the memecoin holds the $1.00 level as support. This could propel the token toward an initial target of $1.15, before reclaiming the $1.26 level and finally reclaiming the $1.37 mark. WIF Breakout Eyes $1.50 Trader Coinvo suggested that WIF’s “classic break and re-test pattern” is “guaranteed” to send the memecoin’s price in a parabolic rally. Similarly, analyst Carl Runefelt from The Moon Show affirmed that dogwifhat is “potentially ready to continue its rally to new highs.” Per the chart, WIF has been in a symmetrical triangle pattern over the past week, with price breaking out of the upper boundary after surging above the $1.05 level. According to the formation, the cryptocurrency targets $1.50 if the breakout is confirmed. This level has been a crucial horizontal level, serving as a key bounce area during the 2024 retraces, and could propel dogwifhat to higher targets if reclaimed. Related Reading: Avalanche (AVAX) Eyes 30% Rally Amid Cup-And-Handle Pattern Breakout Meanwhile, analyst The Cryptonomist highlighted a falling wedge pattern in WIF’s lower timeframe chart. The memecoin broke out of the 3-day pattern after today’s bounce, breaking out of the upper boundary after reclaiming the $1.03 mark. The analyst stated that WIF could target the $1.49 resistance area if it holds its current levels and the entire market “goes for another leg up from here.” As of this writing, dogwifhat trades at $0.14, a 1.8% increase in the daily timeframe.

This newly launched altcoin is making waves following its listings on several top-tier exchanges, including Binance, KuCoin, CoinEx, and XT.COM. And with aggressive marketing, serious community engagement, and high-yield staking incentives, NXPC has quickly become the digital asset that everyone seems to be talking about. The increasing excitement over Nexpace is not merely a function of promotion. It is based on serious, real activity happening on the chain. That’s clear when you look at the trading volume and the largeholder (or whale) moves that have been made recently. One such move has brought home just how profitable and how volatile this fast-rising altcoin can be. NXPC Sees Explosive Debut Across Major Platforms NXPC owes much of its recent acceleration to a coming-together of lucky factors and a smart rollout strategy. NEXE is in the process of lining up listings on several of the world’s largest cryptocurrency trading platforms, among them Binance and KuCoin. Listing on these platforms has lit a fire under NXPC trading, making the new token visible and liquid in and to the broad trading company geographic community of cryptocurrency traders. In addition to its direct exposure through exchange listings, Nexpace has been working to establish a presence in the crypto community by way of several high-profile community-building events. There have been airdrops and token giveaway campaigns, and those are at least somewhat par for the course with crypto community events at this point. But there’s also been a series of eye-catching events that have offered up some high-stakes trading for Nexpace derivatives, not to mention a series of very attractive APY offers that have been getting the attention of liquidity providers and yield farmers. Another huge factor in NXPC’s ascendance has been community engagement. The project has built a massive, and in some ways, unique user base, with who it interacts directly on daily basis through its Telegram and Twitter channels. The heavy use of these platforms is not something unusual for a blockchain project, of course; lots of them do the same. What sets NXPC apart is the kind of activity it holds on these channels, and the kind of community base it has built. Whale Scores Big But Misses the Top An exemplary case of the volatility and upside potential of NXPC occurred when a crypto whale turned that situation into a million-dollar profit. Using blockchain data, we know the approximate timing of the investment made. In total, 1.136 million NXPC tokens were bought at a price of $1.25 each. That amounts to around $1.42 million invested. Briefly after the whale made its entrance into the market, NXPC got a huge price push, hitting a high of $3.80 within a single day. Had the whale sold at the peak, the unrealized profit would have been almost $2.9 million . However, the investor held onto the tokens, probably looking for a better sell signal or avoiding slippage on such a large sell-off. Approximately two hours ago, the whale finally sold the whole NXPC holding—around $3.02 million worth—to Binance at an average sell price of $2.66. Now, this sale came at the end of a notable retracement from the day’s high, but still, our not-so-friendly whale walked away with a solid $1.6 million profit. This isn’t just a story about how to sell tokens quickly. The unpredictability of new token markets and the risks of trading in them makes this tale noteworthy. Market Reaction and Outlook Listing NXPC rapidly on numerous exchanges, together with the activity of market whales and some well-coordinated promotional events, has created the conditions for a stock that is both highly volatile and highly interesting. As an increasing number of retail traders and even some institutional players become aware of NXPC and what it is, this stock is liable to continue making large upward or downward price moves, with even larger trading volume accompanying those price moves. With that being said, analysts are cautious and believe that the token\u2019s future performance will be dependent on more than just what folks are throwing into it and more on what is actually happening with the token deep in its codebase and with its development team. \u201cIts link to the MapleStory Universe could be a game-changer if the team follows through with integrations or partnerships in the gaming and metaverse space,\u201d an analyst said. \u201cHowever, without clear use cases and sustained utility, tokens like NXPC often struggle to maintain long-term value after initial hype fades. As of now, Nexpace remains among the most monitored altcoins in the sector, with traders paying close attention to its exchange inflows, the action of its price, and any announcements made related to the project itself. Whether this momentum translates into a sustainable, long-term success or shrinks to nothing as just another brief pump remains to be seen. In any case, NXPC’s debut is another reminder of how quickly fortunes can be made—and unmade—in the crypto space. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

44722311,https://nulltx.com/?p=149695,1747460066,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Trump-linked DeFi Project WLFI Buys $3.6M in EOS, Fueling 10% Price Surge",https://nulltx.com/trump-linked-defi-project-wlfi-buys-3-6m-in-eos-fueling-10-price-surge/,"In a surprising development that renewed interest in one of the oldest crypto assets, WLFI , a decentralized project in the field of finance (DeFi) and reportedly backed by the Trump family, made another major acquisition on its way to becoming the global standard for decentralized assets. This time around, the DeFi project purchased nearly 3.64 million EOS tokens—turns out a fair amount of them were in circulation. All told, the tokens cost just slightly less than $3 million. The most recent purchase from WLFI marks the first in two months and is a strategic addition to one of the most closely scrutinized on-chain DeFi portfolios. With this acquisition, EOS breaks the out of a multi-year falling wedge and is up close to 10% from where it was before the buy. WLFI Spends $2.996M on EOS as It Resumes Buying Spree Following a two-month hiatus, the WLFI wallet boldly reentered the market, making a hefty purchase: 3.636 million EOS tokens for $2.996 million. This translates to about $0.824 per token. To put this in context, EOS is now part of a portfolio that already held a number of other tokens including ETH, WBTC, TRX, LINK, AAVE, ENA, MOVE, ONDO, SEI, AVAX, and MNT. In recent years, EOS has not been able to regain the kind of momentum it previously enjoyed, but this prominent purchase might be a sign of fresh enthusiasm. Financial pundits were swift to lay the blame for the price increase on WLFI’s operational decision, especially as the EOS price had recently broken out of a multi-year technical wedge formation. The strategy of WLFI appears to be one of concentrated, long-term accumulation of what it considers to be reasonably priced or strategically significant digital assets. While this has yet to bear fruit in the form of actual profits, it certainly seems to be attracting attention, apparently due to the scale of the investment and the rumored associations with Trump family figures. WLFI’s On-Chain Portfolio: $347 Million In, $291 Million Out Following the recent EOS acquisition, WLFI has now invested a total of $347 million across 12 different tokens. The project’s asset mix includes both established names like BTC and ETH, as well as emerging new players like ENA and MOVE. If we look at the current market price of these tokens, the total value of WLFI’s holdings is about $291 million. That gives us an unrealized loss of approximately $53.07 million, or 15 percent. 时隔 2 个月，特朗普家族支持的 DeFi 项目 WLFI 再次进行了代币购买：一个半小时前使用 299.6 万 USDT 购买了 363.6 万枚 $EOS ，购买价格 $0.824。 地址链接 ： https://t.co/kLnqMV3dmf 到目前为止，WLFI 投资组合总共是花了 3.47 亿 U 配置购买了 12… https://t.co/VoAMZPyl2A pic.twitter.com/vgA6EqbIjf — 余烬 (@EmberCN) May 16, 2025 Some may view this as a bad signal, but others see this as part of a long-term strategy to accumulate in a market that is currently undervalued. In fact, the portfolio seems to be in a process of diversification not just across assets in different sectors of the crypto space but also across different kinds of investment vehicles. That is, layer-1 protocols, DeFi platforms, and real-world asset integrations are all part of the this crypto portfolio. Interest in WLFI’s operations has only escalated, thanks to the supposed involvement of the Trump family. No governmental offices have made any official statements confirming this association, but that hasn’t stopped blockchain analysts from trying to figure out who’s behind the project. They continue to track wallet activity very closely, and with even more zest—and with even more zest and suspicion—try to figure out just who is working with them. Market Reacts as EOS Tests Key Support After the latest WLFI transaction, EOS saw a direct price increase of 10 percent. The token has now gone beyond a multi-year falling wedge pattern, which generally is seen as a shift toward a bullish indicator. This change has now put EOS in the between so-called “price zones,” where it’s had high demand in the past, from about $0.83 to $0.69. Should EOS keep this support level, a longer-term recovery could be under way. WLFI could end up with well-timed exposure, but whether it sustains that exposure will hinge on two key factors: 1. The broader market conditions we’re in and 2. EOS’s ability to maintain any sort of momentum in this recovery. Market traders and analysts closely monitor WLFI’s wallet. Every new move they make sends ripples through the market, affecting price direction and sentiment. Whether this means EOS is about to make a comeback or just enjoying a rebound remains to be seen. For now, the strategic bets that WLFI is making are drawing both curiosity and criticism. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

44722346,https://nulltx.com/?p=149694,1747460182,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Large LDO Transfers Spark Speculation Amidst Market Activity,https://nulltx.com/large-ldo-transfers-spark-speculation-amidst-market-activity/,"In the previous three days, the crypto community has been paying special attention to the Lido DAO (LDO) tokens due to some hefty on-chain activity. Or, to put it more bluntly, two Ethereum addresses have sent a combined total of over 30 million dollars’ worth of LDO to some very prominent centralized exchanges—almost within the same 24-hour period. This begs a couple of questions. For one, what in the world is going on here? And for another, what could this mean for the price of LDO? Massive LDO Movements: Over $30 Million in Three Days Over the past 72 hours, two Ethereum addresses—0x2c7AE and 0x3A765—have together shifted around 30 million LDO tokens, with signals that these tokens are being sent to large exchanges like Binance, OKX, Bybit, and Gate.io. Particularly noteworthy is the address 0x2c7AE, which has direct ties to the “Lido: Team Vesting” contract. Roughly six months ago, it received 30 million LDO from the vesting contract, a token transaction we usually associate with team members, advisors, or early contributors. Since then, the address has held a large portion of those tokens and appears to have used the vesting contract to deposit tokens into the 0x address, which it has now been using to transfer the tokens into unknown addresses. For three days alone, 0x2c7AE has transferred out approximately 19.917 million LDO, equivalent to nearly $19.25 million. In October 2023, the institutional trading platform FalconX sent 15.45 million LDO to the second address, 0x3A765. When this transaction occurred, the trading price of LDO was approximately $1.87 per token. In the three days leading up to this analysis, the second address moved out a significant chunk of its LDO holdings—10.612 million LDO, to be exact—making this a noteworthy transaction in the current LDO trading environment. 这是 Lido 机构还是团队的出货？ 过去 3 天时间，包含一个可能属于 @LidoFinance 团队归属地址在内的 2 个地址将 1111 万枚 LDO ($11.53M) 转进了 Binance、OKX、Bybit、Gate。 并且他们在 5 小时前继续转出了 1941 万枚 LDO ($19.25M)，这些应该也会在接下来被转进各大 CEX。 这两个地址是将 LDO… pic.twitter.com/zyOyhKmcQj — 余烬 (@EmberCN) May 16, 2025 The Role of 0xC4Db and Market Maker Involvement The two addresses mentioned above are routing their LDO token distributions through yet another address, 0xC4Db. This address appears to act as a market maker, or at least an intermediary, that helps maintain liquidity in the LDO token. After receiving large distributions of the token from the aforementioned addresses, 0xC4Db sent a portion of those tokens to several large, reputable exchanges. This pattern of token movement—first from source wallets, then to 0xC4Db, and finally to exchanges—strongly suggests that a market-making strategy is involved or that a large-scale liquidation is being prepared. Such operations are typical for managing liquidity across several CEXs or for aiming to reduce price slippage during sell-offs. The uninterrupted transfer of LDO tokens to 0xC4Db means that more transfers to CEXs are probably about to happen. Five hours before this report, an extra 19.41 million LDO was sent out from the same sender addresses, which seems to indicate that this latest batch was also on its way to the same destination as all previous batches: Somewhere in the vicinity of a centralized exchange. What This Means for LDO and the Market This surge in token activity might mean quite a lot for the LDO setup and for how folks are feeling about the market. One of the wallets these tokens are coming from is linked to a vesting contract for the Lido team. So, if nothing else, this setup tells us that those with insider access to Lido are moving a bunch of tokens around. And you can see why, with the price of LDO having doubled over the preceding month. At the same time, the participation of a big global crypto trading service like FalconX adds further credence to the idea that pro liquidity providers or hedge funds are in the midst of some portfolio adjustment. What all these transfers will ultimately lead to—actual sales or broader market-making operations—remains an open question. The volumes are still large enough to demand our attention. If the tokens are to be sold on the open market, we could expect some short-term downward pressure on the price of LDO. On the other hand, if the tokens are used to provide liquidity, we could expect some stabilization in terms of price and trading, although the increase in circulating supply could offset that somehow. Currently, traders and investors are closely observing LDO trading volumes on exchanges and price action for any changes that could be linked to these large on-chain movements. In Summary: Two addresses have given away a combined 30.5 million LDO tokens over the past three days, mostly to a third address that seems to have a market-making function. These large and strange token movements are mostly tied to the team behind Lido and a trading firm called FalconX. Are they trying to lighten their load? Are they trying to give the appearance of more liquidity in the market? We won’t know the true intent behind the transfers until the market reacts, which it will surely do in the next few days.

The move brought renewed attention to EOS amid broader market consolidation, raising questions about the sustainability of the surge. At the same time, Trump-backed World Liberty Financial (WLFI) is brushing off U.S. lawmakers’ scrutiny, bringing attention to politically connected crypto projects. $3M Purchase Sparks Momentum On-chain data shows WLFI purchased approximately 3.636 million EOS tokens using 2.996 million USDT, at an average price of $0.824. The token was trading around $0.77 before the investment and reached a high of $0.86, later correcting slightly to $0.85. This price move marked a 24-hour gain of 9.39% and helped EOS break past key resistance levels between $0.80 and $0.84. The timing of the investment allowed EOS to outperform while the overall crypto market was hovering near $3.27 trillion in market cap, following a mild correction from recent highs. Technically, New EOS Opportunity? NEW OPPORTUNITY Trump's World Liberty Financial just bought 3.64M $EOS with 3M $USDT at an average price of $0.824. So Let's dive into the technicals of $EOS !

On the weekly chart, EOS has been forming a falling broadening wedge since June 2022, typically a bullish pattern that suggests accumulation. According to the analyst, the price repeatedly dipped lower to gather more buyers due to weak momentum on each bounce. Now, with sentiment turning, the next key upside targets are $1.30 and $1.95. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Chainlink Inks Strategic Partnership With World Liberty Financial to Enhance Cross-chain Capabilities for USD1 , Rebrand to Vaulta and Token Swap $A is now live.

The EOS token is set to be swapped at a 1:1 ratio into a new token called $A by the end of May. The swap began on May 14 and is supported by Crypto.com, which has been developing a partnership with Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT). The rebranding and ecosystem expansion appear to be part of a larger strategy to reposition EOS as a player in decentralized finance infrastructure. Caution With Bull Sentiment Despite the positive momentum, investors are advised to stay cautious. EOS failed to retest its May 10 high of $0.98, and much of the recent surge appears to be driven by the WLFI buy. If the market doesn’t resume an uptrend, the gains could reverse quickly. Still, if EOS can hold above the $0.84 mark and establish it as a support zone, the likelihood of a continued move toward $1 increases . The coming days will be crucial as investors watch whether hype translates into lasting strength. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

44723067,https://invezz.com/?p=2721599,1747460400,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"Nearly 80% gone — MUTM’s price is set to rise, but it’s still one of the best cryptos to buy",https://invezz.com/news/2025/05/17/nearly-80-gone-mutms-price-is-set-to-rise-but-its-still-one-of-the-best-cryptos-to-buy/,"With over 8.5 million dollars raised and nearly 80% of the fourth presale phase already filled, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is approaching its next pricing milestone. While the window is still open at $0.025, that won’t hold much longer — the fifth phase is set to raise the price to $0.03, pushing early investors into the profit zone. Still, even with the increase ahead, MUTM continues to rank among the best cryptos to buy today, especially for those prioritizing utility, long-term value, and early-stage access. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance isn’t chasing short-term attention — it’s building steadily with tangible results. The growing number of holders, now nearing 10,000, and the momentum from fresh capital inflows reflect strong confidence in what the project is creating. Investors aren’t betting on hype — they’re backing infrastructure. The presale phases are carefully structured, each one raising the token price while limiting total allocations. This built-in progression means those who secure their spot earlier benefit more directly — not from speculation, but from transparent pricing mechanics. One of the key appeals of the Mutuum protocol is its core use case: borrowing against crypto holdings without needing to sell. Rather than cashing out during market dips, users will be able to lock up collateral and access liquid assets — preserving long-term positions while gaining short-term flexibility. This approach is especially relevant in volatile markets, where forced exits can trigger taxable events or lost opportunities. Through Mutuum, users can unlock capital while maintaining upside exposure to their original assets. It’s a functionality that positions MUTM as more than a token — it’s a tool for smarter asset management. That’s the type of practical utility that sets apart the next major players in the cryptocurrency space. Mutuum is being developed on Layer 2 infrastructure, giving it a massive edge in speed and cost-efficiency. Gas fees have long been a bottleneck in Ethereum-based DeFi platforms. By building for Layer 2 from the start, Mutuum ensures a smoother experience for both lenders and borrowers. Transactions will be faster, cheaper, and more scalable — helping the platform grow as adoption increases. For investors asking what crypto to buy now, this technical foundation answers the question with substance, not speculation. Mutuum Finance is currently being thoroughly audited by CertiK — a leading blockchain security firm — as part of its effort to establish trust and transparency before launch. This step not only reinforces the platform’s credibility but also shows a clear commitment to long-term reliability. At a time when many new projects skip crucial audits or delay product delivery, Mutuum is aiming to launch with both — a verified smart contract system and a beta version of the platform ready at token listing. With all the pieces falling into place — from Layer 2 scaling to real DeFi use cases — analysts are pointing to MUTM as a top cryptocurrency to watch in 2025. Several forecasts suggest the token could climb significantly beyond its listing price, especially with demand driven by borrowing fees and internal buybacks from protocol revenue. This kind of growth potential, paired with early entry pricing, is what puts MUTM on the radar of serious crypto investors who are looking for more than short-term pumps. Nearly 80% of the current presale phase is already filled, and once the next phase opens, the price moves to $0.03 — closing the door on one of the most accessible entry points. With real features in development, a security audit underway, and strong demand already visible, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as one of the best crypto investments available today. Opportunities like this don’t wait. The structure is in place, the price increase is imminent, and momentum is accelerating. For those looking to secure a position before the shift — this is the time to act.

Here’s the Timeline,https://timestabloid.com/valour-stellar-xlm-etp-is-set-to-launch-heres-the-timeline/,"SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG), a prominent crypto researcher on X, recently drew attention to Valour’s upcoming Stellar (XLM) exchange-traded product (ETP), sharing a documented update that the product is set to launch by the end of 2025. JUST IN: Valour Stellar (XLM) ETP —> to be launched by the end of 2025. Documented. pic.twitter.com/NrirOVhz8U — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) May 15, 2025 This development is part of Valour’s broader strategy to expand its suite of ETPs, aiming to meet the increasing demand for regulated digital asset exposure among institutional and retail investors. Valour’s Path to 100 ETPs and the Role of XLM According to internal communications, Valour’s management has reiterated its goal to offer a diversified suite of 100 ETPs by the end of the year. The company recently listed new products, including the Valour Curve DAO (CRV) and Valour Litecoin (LTC) SEK ETPs, bringing its total to over 65. The addition of Stellar (XLM) ETP is part of a new product pipeline that also includes offerings for other digital assets such as Tron (TRX) and MANTRA (OM), as well as thematic and leveraged baskets. Management stated that this expansion is designed to “meet accelerating demand across geographies for exposure to digital assets via regulated/accessible investment products.” ETPs, ETFs, and Their Impact XLM recently experienced a notable breakout and has gotten renewed attention from crypto investors. The news of XLM ETPs comes amid a broader industry trend where products like XRP ETPs, especially ETFs, are gaining traction in global markets. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Teucrium recently launched a leveraged XRP ETF—the first in the U.S.—and the CEO revealed that this product was the most successful ETF launch in the company’s history. ETPs and ETFs have provided investors with regulated, liquid, and transparent access to cryptocurrencies, supporting mainstream adoption and institutional participation. The market is eager for more crypto-related regulated investment vehicles, and an XLM ETP could receive similar attention and growth. These products typically trade on traditional stock exchanges, allowing investors to gain exposure to digital assets without the complexities of direct custody or wallet management. The world’s first spot XRP ETF was recently launched in Brazil, showing the global desire for these products. The XLM ETP and Expected Market Growth ETPs offer several advantages for the crypto industry. They enable broader participation by lowering barriers to entry, providing regulated access, and enhancing liquidity. The presence of these products on established exchanges also contributes to price discovery and transparency. As noted in Valour’s statement, each new ETP could bring in substantial assets under management, potentially adding up to $750 million in incremental AUM if current trends continue.

Announced at Consensus 2025 by World Liberty co-founder Zak Folkman, Chainlink’s Sergey Nazarov, and Eric Trump, this integration aims to solve long-standing cross-chain security challenges that have cost users billions in losses. Cross-Chain Security and Expansion USD1 can now move easily between different blockchains like Ethereum and BNB Chain , thanks to Chainlink’s tech. This solves a big problem in crypto as most blockchains don’t talk to each other well, and past attempts have led to hacks costing billions. Now, USD1 uses a more secure system that makes it safer and more useful. The stablecoin already has a $2 billion market cap and was even used in a big $2B deal with Binance. While it’s still smaller than Tether or Circle, it’s gaining trust because it’s backed by real assets like U.S. Treasuries and cash held by BitGo Trust. Controversy? US Senator Richard Blumenthal is investigating World Liberty Financial’s USD1 stablecoin because of its connection to President Trump and possible conflicts of interest. In response , World Liberty Financial’s lawyers denied the accusations and defended the stablecoin’s goals. Bridging Traditional Finance and DeFi Zak Folkman emphasized that World Liberty Financial is focused on the future where traditional finance and decentralized finance (DeFi) merge seamlessly. The USD1 token’s cross-chain compatibility is a strategic move toward that vision, leveraging Chainlink’s infrastructure to bring secure, scalable access to both on-chain and off-chain markets. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Donald Trump’s Crypto Firm Invested $3M in EOS , What This Means for You For everyday users, this update means more freedom and security when using USD1. You won’t have to worry as much about losing money when moving stablecoins between different networks. Plus, as USD1 grows and gets easier to use, it could become a reliable option for payments, trading, and more, whether you’re a crypto newbie or a seasoned trader. Overall, this move by World Liberty Financial and Chainlink helps stablecoins get better, safer, and more practical. It’s a sign that crypto is moving closer to becoming a real-world tool that anyone can use confidently. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Analysts Predict One Will Lead",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/can-1000-in-litecoin-or-xrp-match-ethereum-and-solanas-climb-analysts-predict-one-will-lead-2/,"As the crypto market gains momentum in May 2025, investors are evaluating where to allocate their funds for optimal returns. While established cryptocurrencies like Litecoin (LTC) and XRP are showing signs of recovery, Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) are capturing attention with their recent performance. Additionally, emerging projects like MAGACOINFINANCE are entering the conversation as potential high-growth opportunities. Litecoin (LTC): Steady Climb with Moderate Prospects Litecoin is currently trading at approximately $101.94. Analysts suggest that LTC may reach up to $136.71 by the end of 2025, indicating a potential upside of around 34%. While Litecoin maintains its position as a reliable cryptocurrency, its growth trajectory appears more conservative compared to newer, more dynamic projects XRP: Legal Clarity Fuels Optimism XRP is trading near $2.59, benefiting from recent legal resolutions that have provided greater regulatory clarity. With increased institutional interest and potential ETF developments, analysts foresee XRP testing resistance levels around $3.00. This positions XRP as a strong contender for investors seeking moderate risk with potential for steady gains. Ethereum (ETH): Institutional Interest Drives Momentum Ethereum is currently priced at approximately $2,613.99. The approval of Ethereum ETFs and growing adoption in decentralized finance (DeFi) are contributing to its upward trajectory. Analysts predict that ETH could reach between $2,700 and $3,387 by the end of 2025, offering a potential return of up to 30%. Solana (SOL): Rapid Growth and Ecosystem Expansion Solana is trading around $179.94, demonstrating significant growth driven by its high-speed transaction capabilities and expanding ecosystem. With increasing adoption in areas like NFTs and decentralized applications, SOL is poised for continued expansion. Analysts suggest that Solana could reach up to $190 in the near term, with long-term projections as high as $400 by 2025. MAGACOINFINANCE: Emerging High-Risk, High-Reward Opportunity MAGACOINFINANCE is an emerging project currently in its presale phase, attracting attention for its unique positioning and community-driven approach. With a presale price under $0.07, early investors see potential for significant returns if the project gains traction. While speculative, MAGACOINFINANCE represents a high-risk, high-reward opportunity for those looking to diversify their crypto portfolios. THE MOST-WATCHED PRESALE OF 2025 – ACT NOW Conclusion: Diversified Strategies for Varied Risk Profiles For investors with a moderate risk appetite, Ethereum and Solana offer promising growth backed by strong fundamentals and institutional interest. Litecoin and XRP provide more conservative options with steady, albeit slower, growth potential. For those willing to embrace higher risk for the possibility of substantial returns, emerging projects like MAGACOINFINANCE may be worth exploring.

Democrat Christy Goldsmith Romero announced that she will officially leave the CFTC as of May 31. This departure, combined with the departure of Summer Mersinger, the member who succeeded Dawn Stump who announced last term that she would be leaving, leaves a significant vacancy on the CFTC. By the end of the month, there will be only two members left: Democrat Kristin Johnson and Republican Caroline Pham. However, Pham had announced that he planned to step down after Brian Quintenz was appointed chairman. However, Quintenz's nomination hearing before the Senate Agriculture Committee has not yet been scheduled, so Pham is continuing in his role for now. Related News: Why Did the Judge Reject the Settlement in the Ripple-SEC Case? Three Legal Sources Respond The CFTC requires at least two commissioners to make a decision, which requires Johnson and Pham to be actively involved in every vote. If Johnson were to abstain or abstain for any reason, that could create a serious procedural impasse. And with only two members, a 1-1 tie vote on any regulation would be a major hurdle. These developments come as Congress is considering granting the CFTC broader authority over cryptocurrency markets, and the weakening of the regulatory structure marks a critical period for the future of crypto policy. The White House has not yet made any announcements about who will replace Mersinger and Goldsmith Romero. The newly appointed commissioners will play a key role in determining the roadmap the U.S. will follow in cryptocurrency regulation. *This is not investment advice.

Those who caught the wave early saw incredible returns. But now, as Ripple XRP price prediction experts weigh in on its future, a new contender is entering the spotlight—and it’s looking like the early-stage opportunity XRP once was. That contender is Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S). Right now, XRP’s price faces some pressure. Analysts suggest that if selling continues, XRP could fall toward these support zones: 50-day EMA at $2.27 100-day EMA at $2.25 200-day EMA at $2.00 While long-term believers still hold hope, others are shifting their focus toward Bitcoin Solaris.

BSV has traded under the 200-day EMA band since early 2025, indicating a bearish trend. Analysts predict a gradual price increase, with potential highs reaching $175 by 2030. Since the beginning of the year, signaling prolonged bearish sentiment, Bitcoin SV (BSV) has consistently traded below its 200-day EMA band . Despite attempts to gain traction, the asset has failed to show any long-term bullish reversal, raising doubts among investors and traders about its recovery potential. Many ask: Is BSV a hidden gem waiting for its breakout, or just another risky bet? In this Bitcoin SV price prediction 2025 article, we’ll explore the future for BSV Price from 2025 through 2030.

With an average of $86 , the BSV token price can hit a high of $117 and a low of $55. Year Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) 2025 55 86 117 BSV Price Prediction 2025 It is a fact that a movement seen in Q4 2024 is terribly missed by BSV investors, and in Q2 2025, several optimistic factors were there, but was not enough for this crypto. Many expected for it to hit round number of $50. But, it has not yet, making many investors’ morale down, as bulls are not able to defeat bearish forces and are still stuck beneath the 200-day EMA band for the last 5 months. When writing, BSV is exchanging hands at $36.77 and has erased more than 80% of the gains of early May’s optimism. This suggests that bears are getting dominant over bulls. Bitcoin SV 1D Chart Even per on-chain data, shows that transactions per day are declining, on May 15, txs fell upto 12373, which was 57.36% down from the previous day’s 29020 transactions. If this continues, then the BSV price might fall to $30. This may end, but if any catalystic event occurs and people start buying it once again, these transactions per day will start to increase. But here is the catch, the bullish trend will be confirmed if it flips the 200-day EMA band or price level above $42. Source: network-stats.bsvblockchain Amid bearish metrics, a surprising on-chain metric gives some bullish hopes, as UTXO count, which represents unspent portions of cryptocurrency , is growing this week. Which could be a bullish sign, if it continues to grow, maybe it could help in easing the bearish pressure. Therefore, this could be bullish for Bitcoin SV crypto’s price if it reflects genuine adoption. Source: network-stats.bsvblockchain Moreover, if the price rises with mass adoption in BSV and clears $42, then it will gain the potential boost for reaching $65 by 2025 end.

The statement reads: “100% BANKS ARE DRAGGING THEIR FEET ON XRP ADOPTION. Why? They’re figuring out how to profit from it. Once their revenue models are locked in, it’s game on. Agree or Disagree? Talk to me…” 100% BANKS ARE DRAGGING THEIR FEET ON XRP ADOPTION. Why? They’re figuring out how to profit from it. Once their revenue models are locked in, it’s game on. Agree or Disagree? Talk to me… — All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) May 14, 2025 The tweet suggests that the hesitation of institutions is strategic rather than reactive, rooted in the desire to lock in profitable models before engaging in full-scale adoption. Community Response Points to Regulation The post attracted a range of responses from community members, many of whom offered a more technical or regulatory explanation for the delay in institutional engagement with XRP. One notable reply came from an X user named Michael, who disagreed with the suggestion that banks are simply taking their time to figure out revenue strategies. Michael wrote , “You’re half right… but missing the whole picture.” He emphasized that regulatory uncertainty and the alignment of financial infrastructure are the real reasons why banks have not adopted XRP at scale. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Infrastructure Overhaul and Compliance Requirements Michael pointed out that the lack of established stablecoin legislation in the United States presents a key barrier to institutional involvement. He noted, “No bank is touching XRP for settlement at scale until there’s a clear legal framework for digital assets.” He also referenced the global transition to ISO 20022 , stating that while Ripple and some of its partners are already ISO-compliant, the financial industry’s messaging standard is only set to be fully implemented by SWIFT in November 2025. Another critical infrastructure upgrade mentioned was Fedwire’s scheduled adoption of ISO 20022 in July 2025. According to Michael, this change will create the groundwork for real-time, tokenized value transfers. He insisted that the financial system operates with centralized control and cannot proceed with innovations like XRP-based settlement until regulatory and technical systems are fully aligned. He concluded, “This isn’t banks ‘figuring it out’ — it’s staged deployment.” Legal Restrictions Still in Effect Another user offered a shorter but pointed observation regarding the current legal environment. T.T. referenced the ongoing litigation involving the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Ripple, noting , “Nope, injunction is still in place from the SEC lawsuit. Once it clears, they will load up in anticipation of use case. They are working on application in the background.” This view further reinforces the idea that the current lack of adoption is not due to indecision or disinterest but rather external legal and regulatory constraints that continue to affect institutional decision-making. Both responses indicate a shared view that banks are not hesitating without reason, but rather acting under legal and systemic constraints. These perspectives are different from the original tweet from All Things XRP, which focuses on profit motivation as the primary cause of delay.

Employs varied options strategies (collars, diagonals, calendars) to generate high monthly income (~40% extrapolated). LFGY suits investors looking to ride crypto adjacent infrastructure with less volatility while deriving high income from it. Investors must keep expectations right, as the high yield comes at the cost of NAV erosion - de-risking investments continually from the underlying. Yet another crypto-based income offering from YieldMax. The YieldMax Crypto Industry & Tech Portfolio Option Income ETF ( LFGY ) derives option writing income on a cash portfolio of crypto securities and related technology companies. And introduces a new flavor in diversification from the existing bitcoin related income products I have covered in my pervious writings, viz. CONY , MSTY and YBIT . The major point of difference I see is the varied portfolio underlying. The top ten holdings (of 19 securities I saw) at the time of writing looks like this LFGY Top Ten Holdings (YieldMax LFGY) It is interesting to note the presence of indirectly connected securities like Tesla and NVIDIA, making for a wholly diversified exposure compared to the single stock income offerings I have explored so far. What is also interesting is the mention of all sorts of option writing strategies such as collars, diagonal spreads and calendar spreads in its prospectus - not only the call spreads mentioned in all other YieldMax income ETFs. We will check what these differences translate to in terms of performance, but the option structures adopted are likely to limit upside opportunity losses (compared to the call write) and hence also protect the NAV better. The diversification by sector and bitcoin infrastructure type is highlighted below. Diversification should do well across market conditions to a larger extent than concentrated bets, particularly important for an income plan. The presence of exciting additions like Tesla and NVIDIA (grouped as other in the distribution by infrastructure type) is not material (~4%), but does add flavor to the mix. Also, how the portfolio changes in the future could also add potential alpha to this extremely active offering. LFGY diversification by sector (Image generated by author using data from YieldMax LFGY) LFGY diversification by infrastructure type (Image generated by author using data from YieldMax LFGY) Performance LFGY is a relatively new offering with not too much track record to gauge performance well. Also, since there is no true single underlying nor an index tracking the portfolio, judging the underlying's suitability in terms of optimum volatility is skipped from this analysis. The closest index I saw to benchmark performance against is the BITQ ETF, but the holdings (though similar) show significant differences. Other than the weightage and composition differences, technology innovators like Tesla and NVIDIA are completely missing from BITQ. BITQ ETF Top 10 Holdings (BITQ ETF) Comparing performances across the similar ETF universe, in the limited time period of common existence, the first thing to note is a similar trend across all. However, the subtle differences will get magnified as market cycles change and the time period extends. LFGY sits in the middle of the stack, overall growth of $10K would have been higher than BITQ and CONY and lower than YBIT and MSTY. Data by YCharts I will divide the data into two phases of downtrend and uptrend to get a cleaner view of market condition-based performance. As seen in my previous analyses, ETFs that perform better in downtrends are usually a better longer-term bet as an income plan. It will also help see whether the tech allocations in LFGY delivers the diversification as bitcoin falls. Data by YCharts The results show vast differences. YBIT, which I had earlier rated a buy, performs exceptionally well, while LFGY again finds itself in the middle. This could be attributed to the fact that pure bitcoin plays held up better in the period that crypto companies like Coinbase or a larger aggregated collection of crypto companies like BITQ faltered. That said, LFGY does perform better than BITQ and CONY. Which means that LFGY is the ETF of choice if you are looking to derive income while choosing to ride bitcoin adjacent infrastructure, i.e. companies into exchanges, custody platforms and indirectly poised to benefit from bitcoin volumes than bitcoin itself (and some direct exposure thrown in). Income Potential The ETF has paid out roughly 17% of capital invested since its inception in January 2025, as payouts. While that has come with a commensurate erosion of NAV, the extrapolated annual payout of ~40% has use cases. First, in a widely different market trending down, LFGY will likely outperform the underlying holdings while deriving income. Second, in an upward trending market, LFGY will see less NAV erosion while generating these high levels of returns. Third, irrespective of market trends, a faster payout suits those who are looking to de-risk themselves quickly and reinvest the payouts in other alternatives, while continuing to ride the underlying for alpha. Investment Advice For investors who are mildly bullish about bitcoin adjacent infrastructure companies but do not want to proactively manage a portfolio and derive similar income levels, as LFGY, from it, LFGY is a buy. Although, it is in its nascent stages and untested across a larger tenure and across market cycles. The premium discount to NAV is reasonable compared to some other YieldMax products. The maximum deviation is ~1%. Which means there is no pressing need to average out an entry over days to ensure the deviations smoothen out. Premium Discount to NAV - LFGY (YieldMax LFGY) When investing in YieldMax's aggressive payout ETFs, keep in mind that they fit into the speculative yield enhancer part of your portfolio more than pure income play like multi asset allocators with lower returns. The dividend payout is not purely premiums earned from option writing (as seen with the total returns), but also a return on capital deployed. If you set your expectations right, then LFGY could be just the bitcoin ETF that makes a lot of sense in your overall income strategy.",LFGY,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-05-17 06:26:33

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has emerged as one of the most responsive altcoins, often reacting quickly to global market catalysts. With Bitcoin (BTC) pushing past the $100K mark, many are wondering if BCH Price is preparing for its own “banana move” in the next leg of the bull run. Beyond price speculation, BCH is proving its utility. Ranked 4th on Crypwerk’s global adoption list, Bitcoin Cash continues to gain real-world traction with merchants and institutions alike.

If Bitcoin Cash gains some hype in the coming months, then the BCH price can reach $701 in 2025. On the flip side, the BCH price can drop to $507 during that year. We expect the BCH price to create a new 2025 high of $701 during the upcoming altcoin season. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $507 $605 $701 BCH Price Prediction 2025 The BCH price action has highlighted that in the long term, it is following a long-term multi-year trendline, and at every bull run in the past, the price has reversed after touching that long-term trendline. In the year 2025, it is clearly visible on the chart that strength fell short to overcome the multi-year trendline resistance and reversed the strong gains of May 8th, which was due to a trade deal between the US and UK that boosted the price . Bitcoin Cash/US Dollar 1D Chart But, like in the past, if it’s going on, then the $300 support could defend the fall, like it has always maintained. However, if the falling prices catch a quick support from the 200-day EMA bands , then it could signal growth for BCH. If it clears the $605 level that nearly aligns with the multiyear resistance trendline, then $710 could be the target for the 2025 end, and if not, then $300 would catch the fall. Moreover, the transaction are on the rise in Q2 2025, which points its finger towards increase in user activity and adoption, and which could accelerate in future.

Recent announcements regarding regulatory clarity and rising institutional interest have sparked renewed excitement across various blockchain sectors. Among these developments, Qubetics ($TICS) has emerged as a focal point, driving significant buzz due to its ongoing crypto presale success and promise to address long-standing interoperability challenges that define many top rated crypto projects. As global markets adjust to evolving policies and participant appetite fluctuates, the impact on major cryptocurrencies and emerging projects is pronounced. Immutable X has made headlines with its advancements in scaling solutions for NFTs, while AAVE continues to solidify its standing in decentralized finance with innovative lending protocols. This triad of projects is demonstrating resilience and growth potential, making them some of the most promising top rated crypto assets to watch throughout the year. Qubetics stands out by targeting core blockchain limitations that have hindered widespread adoption. Unlike predecessors that focused primarily on isolated use cases, Qubetics integrates multi-chain interoperability designed to streamline operations for businesses, professionals, and individual users. This approach positions Qubetics as a key player poised to meet future demands in blockchain-enabled digital finance, bridging gaps that previous solutions could not overcome. Qubetics: The Interoperability Pioneer Driving the Next Wave of Top Rated Crypto Qubetics has rapidly gained traction in 2025, currently in the 34th stage of its crypto presale , having sold over 512 million tokens to more than 26,500 holders and raised upwards of $17 million. Priced at $0.2532 per token during this phase, the project has attracted notable attention within the top rated crypto category due to its focus on interoperability and cross-chain integration. The core strength of Qubetics lies in simplifying blockchain interoperability for businesses and individuals. By enabling seamless asset transfers and data sharing across multiple blockchain networks, Qubetics reduces friction that traditionally complicates decentralized finance and enterprise blockchain adoption. This interoperability enhances efficiency and expands utility, setting Qubetics apart from many existing projects. Additionally, Qubetics’ non-custodial multi-chain wallet offers users a secure, unified platform to manage diverse assets without relying on centralized intermediaries. This empowers businesses to streamline cross-border transactions and professionals to engage with decentralized applications effortlessly. Analyst forecasts further elevate the standing of Qubetics within the top rated crypto space. Predictions estimate a 294% return on investment if the token reaches $1 post-presale, scaling to 1,874% at $5, and a substantial 5,822% following mainnet launch at $15.

Qubetics is also advancing its ecosystem through partnerships focused on real-world applications, including decentralized VPN services and enterprise blockchain solutions tailored for the Central Asian market. These developments emphasize utility beyond speculative gains, reinforcing Qubetics as a top rated crypto with genuine adoption potential.

Its market cap followed suit, rising by 3.03% to reach $3.57 billion. A major driver behind this uptick appears to be the significant boost in trading activity, with 24-hour volume jumping 60.74% to $447.61 million. This spike pushed the volume-to-market cap ratio to 12.58%, suggesting heightened investor interest. AAVE’s fully diluted valuation (FDV) is currently at $3.76 billion, with 15.11 million tokens circulating out of a 16 million total supply.

Projects like Qubetics illustrate how breaking down silos between networks unlocks new possibilities for efficiency and innovation. Key aspects of blockchain interoperability include: Cross-chain asset transfers enabling seamless movement of tokens and data across multiple blockchains. Unified wallet solutions allowing users to manage diverse assets without fragmented interfaces. Enterprise integration capabilities facilitating blockchain adoption within traditional business workflows. Enhanced scalability by distributing workloads across interconnected networks. Improved security through diversified validation and consensus mechanisms.

As AI narratives gain traction, could WLD stage a comeback? In this Worldcoin price prediction 2025–2030, we explore whether WLD is poised for a breakout or destined to stay in the shadows. Table of contents Overview CoinPedia’s WLD Price Prediction Worldcoin Price Prediction 2025 WLD Price Forecast 2026 – 2030 Worldcoin Price Forecast 2026 WLD Price Prediction 202 7 Worldcoin Price Forecast 2028 WLD AI Token Price Forecast 2029 Worldcoin AI Token Price Prediction 2030 Market Analysis FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency WorldCoin WDC Token WDC Price $ 0.00349731 -10.28% Market Cap $ 0.00 Circulating Supply 0.00 Trading Volume $ 5.1958 All-time High $11.82 on 10th March 2024 All-time Low $0.9758 on 13th September 2023 CoinPedia’s WLD Price Prediction As per Coinpedia’s Worldcoin Price Prediction, marketers’ optimism and the involvement of high-profile figures could significantly boost Worldcoin’s potential value. Further, this credibility and backing, combined with a potential increase in trading volume, could drive the price of WLD Coin to an impressive $5.89 by the end of 2025. If the market faces external pressures, then it could potentially drive the price down to a low of $1.61 . Price Prediction Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) 2025 1.61 3.25 5.89 Worldcoin Price Prediction 2025 Bitcoin is ranging comfortably over $100k , and the crypto market sentiment has turned bullish after the US eased its trade wars, starting with making a pact with the UK, and coming to an understanding with China to decrease their insane tariffs on both countries’ side. This optimism drove fuel to many assets, including equity markets and cryptocurrencies as well. Like many altcoins, Worldcoin is also seeing bullish momentum, but how long will it last? Many are curious about that. As shown on the chart, in Q2 2025, the growth it showed was more than 2x already, coming from a low of $0.57 to $1.30. But despite the optimism, the boost doesn’t show enough strength to even surpass the 2300-day EMA , which is keeping it below the last six months. When looking at its historical price action, these 2x gains are as small as a bucket of water from a well. Because, from early 2024, the high WLD price is nearly 90% down, despite a recent surge. So many are thinking that what it needs is what could push its price higher, then, like what has always worked in the crypto sector, is its social sentiment. Therefore, marketers’ optimism and the involvement of high-profile figures could significantly boost Worldcoin’s potential value. If this works, then the Worldcoin price might be able to flip the long-dominating dynamic 200-day EMA band resistance, but if it happens, then first it needs to attain a Change of Character (ChoCh) in the current WLD price structure by clearing the $2.12 mark in May. Once cleared and ChoCh built, the WLD price might retest $4.18 by 2025 year end. On the other hand, if Worldcoin fails to stay on the bullish course in 2025, the price of WLD can plunge to $1.10.

This is according to sources familiar with the situation. Still, representatives from Kraken and Binance have yet to confirm or speak about the matter. Hackers tried bribing Binance staff to steal customer information Scammers allegedly targeted Binance, offering bribes to the platform’s customer service staff, and even included a Telegram handle for further communication with the staff. Luckily, the exchange uses artificial intelligence bots to detect possible bribe offers in multiple languages and halt those conversations. Like most other exchanges, only specific representatives can access customer information during customer-initiated calls. Last year, in December, a number of rival exchanges noticed the social engineering attacks on Coinbase and warned the exchange’s team. According to people familiar with the matter, at least one exchange alerted the Coinbase’s security team through Telegram multiple times. However, Coinbase has yet to comment on whether other exchanges reached out to them. Despite reported warnings, hackers managed to bribe some customer service employees, convincing them to steal customer data, including names, dates of birth, addresses, nationalities, and other banking details. The hackers then asked for $20 million from the exchange to delete the information they received. Coinbase claimed it started seeing suspicious activity from their representatives as early as January. The information they stole could easily be used to impersonate the exchange, draw in unsuspecting users, or impersonate the victims with other service providers and gain access to their accounts. Mike Dudas, the managing partner of the web3 firm 6MV, even commented, “It’s a major breach; the amount of personal information shared is staggering. It will make people have to consider their personal physical security, especially with the things happening in France and elsewhere.” DOJ charged 12 people with money laundering and RICO conspiracy Social engineering attacks on crypto exchanges have increased for the last two years. Attackers have taken to buying users’ information and using malware to acquire information on the dark web. Hackers tried to call some Binance users in Israel, baiting them to move their funds into a new wallet they managed. The Department of Justice also recently just indicted 12 people for allegedly taking part in an international cyber racketeering operation that brought in more than $263 million. The 12 defendants are facing charges of RICO conspiracy, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, money laundering, and obstruction of justice. The associates reportedly used the stolen digital assets to buy nightclub services ranging up to $500,000 per evening, luxury handbags, extravagant watches valued between $100,000 and $500,000, and rental homes in Los Angeles, Hamptons, and Miami. They also rented private jets, hired a team of private security guards, and bought at least 28 exotic cars for about $100,000 to $3.8 million. The DOJ claimed they laundered the stolen funds through several mixers and exchanges through peel chains, pass-through wallets, and virtual private networks. Among the 12 is Malone Lam, who also stole about 4100 BTC in August 2024 and about $14 million in crypto in July of that same year. Malone and his associates were also involved in home break-ins. In one instance, Marlon Ferro, one of the enterprise members, broke into a home in New Mexico to take a hardware digital asset wallet while Lam kept tabs on the victim’s location.

Despite a strong recovery from $100,762, recent candles show indecision with tightening Bollinger Bands and flattening RSI. The current rangebound movement comes after a multi-week rally that saw Bitcoin price spikes toward $105,787, followed by sustained rejection near major Fibonacci resistance.

The latest weekly candle formed a long upper wick just below the 0.786 Fibonacci level at $104,929, indicating heavy supply pressure.

This increase had come as a much-needed relief for the crypto market, which had watched the ETH price struggled while Bitcoin thrived. However, the bullish breakout has not lasted long as bears have once again taken control and sellers are now dominating. Given this recent trend, it is possible that the Ethereum price has seen the end of price decline. Ethereum Lower Lows Present Troubling Trend Crypto analyst Gianni Pichichero has explained what could be going on with the Ethereum price and why the current trend could be worrying. This goes through the different processes and how the altcoin has been moving since the start of the week, starting from Monday’s bullish rise to the bearish reversal that took the market by surprise. Related Reading: Bitcoin Weekly SuperTrend Flashes Sell Signal From 2022 Despite BTC/USD Strength Gianni explained that the opening range for the week had established the current monthly high before breaking low. This showed an entry of large players into the market as the Ethereum price was pushed up rapidly to touch the $2,700 mark for the first time in over a month. This had set a bullish tone for the week, following into the next day as Tuesday also showed recovery strength, The next day, Tuesday, the Ethereum price did pump once again and placed a higher high than Monday, suggesting that a continuation was in play. The day also closed out in the green as ETH bulls remained dominant through the trading day. By Wednesday, there had been a turn in the market, whereas the previous days were dominated by bullish rallies, consolidation was the order of the day. This brought the Ethereum price back inside the opening range high of the week and then marked the first red close of the week. This first red close, Gianni explains, was a bearish signal. It initially didn’t signal that the Ethereum price would continue to crash. However, it did show that the bullishness that began on Monday might finally be over. Then, by Thursday, it was already a full-blown reversal as the market tested the previous day’s lows. Thursday’s red close was just as bearish as the market turned in expectation of bearish news. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Price Turning Bullish Or Bearish? Crypto Analyst Reveals Critical Levels To Watch The formation of lower lows on both days has been worrying, and the analyst outlined in the chart that there could be a possible breakdown of the price. In this case, the Ethereum price could again crash back below $2,400, wiping out a notable amount of gains accumulated over the last few weeks. As this unfolds, Gianni suggests that there would not be any crazy moves, but that focus should be on looking for opportunities to sell high in the current market. “ I will be looking for any sell high opportunity after the news, reinforced with bearish price action, as triple tops, double tops and any kind of reversal patterns into the most recent high in place,” he said.

While Kokkalis spotlighted Open Mainnet, a thriving ecosystem of over a thousand apps, and real-world use cases, Dr. Altcoin pointed out serious structural and executional hurdles that could delay true ecosystem growth for several years. 1. Ecosystem Expansion Needs a Proper Venture Team Dr. Kokkalis mentioned the increasing number of applications being built on Pi. However, Dr. Altcoin stressed that a dedicated venture support arm is essential for real growth. Without it, developer efforts may stall due to lack of funding and strategic guidance. 2. Project Funding Selection Could Take 6–12 Months While the high application count reflects interest, Dr. Altcoin explained that selecting viable projects for funding is a time-consuming process . Vetting, evaluating, and shortlisting projects could take at least 6 to 12 months. 3. Fund Disbursement Will Add Another 3–6 Months Even after projects are selected, disbursing funds isn’t immediate . Dr. Altcoin estimates that developers will likely face a wait of 3 to 6 months before receiving financial support, slowing the ecosystem rollout. 4. DApp Development Will Take 1–2 Years Dr. Altcoin raised concerns over the quality of current DApps , stating that building applications with real-world utility and security will take 1 to 2 years. Current excitement over quantity, he argues, is misplaced without quality and functionality. 5. Full Ecosystem Maturity May Take Up to 5 Years According to Dr. Altcoin, a fully developed Pi Network ecosystem — complete with solid infrastructure, funding, and quality applications — is likely 2.5 to 5 years away . The process includes: Forming a capable venture support team Filtering and funding promising projects Development and launch of secure DApps Scaling adoption and real-world use cases 6. PI Token Could See Temporary Surge to $2–$3 In the short term, Dr. Altcoin predicts a potential spike in PI’s price to around $2–$3 if major exchange listings occur. However, he cautions this would be speculative in nature and not tied to actual ecosystem maturity. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Pi Network Might Crash Like Terra Luna : Analyst Raises Red Flags Over Centralization , 7.

Conclusion: Vision vs. Reality Dr. Kokkalis painted a hopeful future, but Dr. Altcoin’s response delivers a necessary reality check. Building a decentralized, functional Pi Network will require years of structured effort, not just speeches and milestones.His final advice to the Pi community: “Lower your expectations for the next five years.” .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Cardano (ADA), Avalanche (AVAX), and Ethereum (ETH) are all hovering at pivotal technical levels, with bullish sentiment beginning to return. As Bitcoin stabilizes, these leading smart contract platforms are becoming the primary focus of renewed capital rotation. Investors are watching closely to see whether they will ignite the next breakout phase as May enters its final stretch. Cardano (ADA) is once again testing the psychologically important $1 resistance. Should it break, analysts see upside potential toward $3 this summer. Avalanche (AVAX) , trading in the low $20s , is also flashing strength and could revisit the $40–$50 zone if network activity and token model upgrades continue to progress. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) , the largest altcoin by market cap, is currently trading near $2,400 and appears poised to reclaim the $2,500 level and perhaps even move back toward its all-time highs later this year. MAGACOINFINANCE Quietly Joins the Conversation as Altcoin Momentum Builds While ADA, AVAX, and ETH command attention, a quieter name is starting to get traction: MAGACOINFINANCE . Unlike tokens that chase headlines or lean on hype cycles, MAGACOINFINANCE has adopted a more methodical path—focusing on community, token fundamentals, and platform evolution. Over the past few weeks, it has increasingly appeared on traders’ radars across Discord and Telegram, particularly among those rotating out of larger caps in search of higher potential ROI plays. While many altcoins have already moved, MAGACOINFINANCE is still in the early accumulation phase—making it an interesting candidate for traders aiming to catch the next trend before wider adoption. STAGE ALMOST FULL — ACT NOW ADA, AVAX, and ETH: Charting the Path Into May’s Final Rally Each of the three major altcoins is flashing technical and narrative support for a strong finish to May: Cardano (ADA) is pushing toward its long-contested $1 zone. With scaling solutions like Hydra and Mithril gaining attention, and developer activity holding steady, market watchers believe a decisive breakout could send ADA soaring toward $3 . Avalanche (AVAX) is forming a higher-low structure between $18 and $23 , a setup often seen before stronger upside moves. With institutional use cases and subnet expansion in both finance and gaming, projections for a late-2025 target of $40–$50 remain intact. Ethereum (ETH) continues to anchor the market. With its price holding firmly above $2,000 , analysts now expect a surge past $2,500 . Long-term projections range from $4,000 to $5,500 —driven by scale improvements, staking incentives, and macro shifts favoring digital assets. CLICK HERE – $0.007 LISTING COMING FAST MAGACOINFINANCE Gains Momentum While Staying Under the Radar Despite the attention on large caps, MAGACOINFINANCE is making quiet but deliberate progress. Wallet activity is trending higher, and traders have noted its resilience during broader altcoin volatility. Liquidity remains limited, but the project has steadily avoided the pump-and-dump volatility that often plagues early-stage tokens. Recent developments include: A 17% uptick in active DEX wallet addresses over 10 days Increased chatter about future cross-chain liquidity solutions A carefully structured token model praised in community polls What sets MAGACOINFINANCE apart is its grassroots momentum. Without influencer promotion or media campaigns, it is building through updates, functionality, and community support—a strategy reminiscent of early MATIC and LINK growth patterns. Conclusion: Can MAGACOINFINANCE Surge With the Majors? ADA, AVAX, and ETH all appear positioned to lead the next leg of the altcoin rally, driven by strong fundamentals and favorable sentiment. If ADA breaks above $1 , AVAX reclaims the $40 range, and ETH surges past $2,500 , the broader market could follow. In this setting, MAGACOINFINANCE may stand to benefit from capital rotation—especially from investors looking beyond high-cap plays. While it lacks explosive media attention, its steady buildup and unique community focus could place it on a breakout path as the second half of May unfolds.

Here’s the Truth Behind the $9 Trillion Rumors,https://coinpedia.org/news/is-blackrock-xrp-etf-coming-soon-heres-the-truth-behind-the-9-trillion-rumors/,"The post Is BlackRock XRP ETF Coming Soon? Here’s the Truth Behind the $9 Trillion Rumors appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Speculation is heating up across social media that BlackRock might secretly be preparing to launch an XRP ETF . Some are even throwing around wild claims about a $9 trillion investment. But how much of this is true? BlackRock’s ETF Track Record: Focused on Bitcoin and Ethereum BlackRock has already made headlines with its Bitcoin ETF and Ethereum ETF, attracting billions in inflows. Experts say their success comes down to one thing: regulatory clarity. Currently, BlackRock holds around $39.33 billion in Bitcoin and $4.18 billion in Ethereum, solidifying its position in crypto’s two leading assets. But when it comes to XRP, the situation is very different. The token is still tied up in legal uncertainty with the SEC , which makes it a risky bet for institutions like BlackRock that prefer assets with official regulatory approval. No Official XRP ETF Filing From BlackRock Despite all the hype, BlackRock has not confirmed any involvement with XRP or Ripple. In fact, the rumored April 2025 XRP Trust filing was completely fake, and BlackRock has publicly denied it. Moreover, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who has been vocal about Bitcoin’s potential, predicting it could reach $700,000, has never commented on XRP. That silence speaks volumes. BlackRock’s head of ETFs has also clarified that the company is not investing in altcoins like XRP. And those viral claims about a $9 trillion XRP investment? Completely false—that number refers to BlackRock’s total assets under management, not any specific crypto asset. Some speculate BlackRock could be indirectly involved with XRP through tokenized real-world assets or blockchain partnerships, but there’s no evidence or official filing to support this. Could an XRP ETF Happen in the Future? For now, BlackRock is playing it safe—focusing on Bitcoin and Ethereum, both of which have cleared regulatory hurdles. But that could change. Nate Geraci, president of ETF Store, thinks it’s only a matter of time. He believes that with the Ripple lawsuit nearing its end, an XRP ETF is likely. According to Geraci, major players like BlackRock and Fidelity won’t want to ignore the third-largest non-stablecoin by market cap. Ripple lawsuit coming to end… Seems obvious spot XRP ETF approval simply matter of time IMO. And yes, I expect BlackRock, Fidelity, etc to all be involved. XRP currently 3rd largest non-stablecoin crypto asset by market cap. Largest ETF issuers aren’t going to ignore this. — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) March 26, 2025 .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price Prediction 2025: Will XRP Hit $9 This Cycle? , Not Everyone Thinks an XRP ETF is a Win But there’s another side to this story. Vandell from Black Swan Capitalist argues that even if BlackRock files for an XRP ETF, it’s not necessarily a win for crypto holders. Why? Because native XRP offers real utility—from cross-border remittances and smart contracts to staking and liquidity provisioning. In contrast, an ETF only gives you price exposure—not the actual benefits of owning XRP. He warns that ETFs can be manipulated by institutions, and urges retail investors to ask themselves: Do you want real XRP utility—or just a Wall Street version of it? Bottom Line Right now, BlackRock has no confirmed XRP ETF plans. The rumors about secret filings and trillion-dollar investments are false. But if Ripple wins full regulatory clarity, the door could open for institutional giants like BlackRock to enter the XRP space. Until then, it’s all speculation. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

According to New Zealand Police, the man is one of 13 individuals charged after authorities executed search warrants across Auckland, Wellington, and California over the past three days . The charges stem from allegations that members of an organized criminal group manipulated seven victims to obtain large amounts of cryptocurrency, which was then laundered through multiple platforms between March and August 2024. The US Department of Justice has indicted the man under federal law, including charges of racketeering, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering, per the announcement.

The accused appeared in Auckland District Court and was granted bail with interim name suppression. He is scheduled to reappear on July 3. “We have worked closely with our law enforcement colleagues in the United States in support of their investigation,” the police stated. They added: “Today’s search warrant and arrest reflects the importance of international partnerships where criminals are operating across borders.” The investigation remains ongoing.

The figure marks a staggering 990% jump from March when reported losses stood at just $33 million. The sharp rise was largely attributed to a single unauthorized Bitcoin transfer that accounted for the bulk of the month’s losses. On April 28, blockchain analyst ZachXBT identified a suspicious $330 million BTC transaction . The incident was later confirmed as a social engineering attack that targeted an elderly US resident, resulting in one of the largest individual crypto thefts to date.

After eliminating Berkshire Hathaway’s stake in JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo in recent years, new filings show Buffett continues to place US banks on the chopping block. Berkshire has now also completely exited Citigroup, unloading its remaining 14,639,502 shares worth about $1 billion in Q1 of this year. Meanwhile, the firm unloaded an additional 48.7 million Bank of America shares in Q1, worth about $2.19 billion. Berkshire Hathaway now holds 631,573,531 shares of the financial giant. And Berkshire also dropped about $46,489,000 in Capital One exposure, or 300,000 shares, with the firm now holding onto 7.15 million shares. Buffett’s firm further sold all shares of Brazilian fintech Nu Holdings. Beyond banking, Berkshire reduced positions in Charter Communications, DaVita, T-Mobile and Liberty Media’s Formula One stock. Meanwhile, Buffett boosted investments in Constellation Brands, doubling its stake to over 12 million shares, and added shares in Domino’s Pizza, Heico, VeriSign, Sirius XM, Pool Corp. and Occidental Petroleum. Berkshire’s Apple position remained unchanged. Berkshire’s cash holdings have now ballooned to $350 billion as of March 31st, up from $334 billion at the end of 2024.

According to the “All Things XRP” account, XRP’s growth is not a mere advantage but essential to Ripple’s long-term viability and strategic goals. RIPPLE DOESN’T JUST “USE” XRP. It needs it to succeed. Here are 7 reasons why Ripple must see XRP’s value explode—backed by cold, hard facts. Let’s dive in. pic.twitter.com/RNeBEtjUJZ — All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) April 30, 2025 Role in Ripple’s Financial Strategy Despite recent speculation that Ripple’s focus may be shifting toward its stablecoin, RLUSD, XRP continues to play a critical role in its operations. Ripple currently holds approximately 42.5 billion XRP tokens, representing a substantial financial asset. The company can generate significant capital by releasing portions of these tokens, providing a non-dilutive revenue source to fund daily operations, acquisitions, and international expansion. For instance, unlocking one billion XRP monthly could yield billions of dollars, a vital resource as Ripple expands its enterprise offerings. Enhancing Institutional Client Adoption Ripple’s payment solutions rely on XRP to facilitate cross-border transfers. A higher XRP price enhances liquidity, making transactions faster and less costly, as fewer tokens are required to complete transfers. This improved efficiency positions Ripple to attract major institutional clients, including well-known financial firms like American Express and Standard Chartered. Ripple wants to replace outdated systems such as nostro and vostro accounts with real-time settlements powered by XRP, thereby reducing friction in large-value international payments. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Fostering Ecosystem Growth Through Token Value The value of XRP directly impacts the health and expansion of Ripple’s ecosystem. Ripple invests in ecosystem projects such as Coil and Keyless, which benefit from a thriving token market that attracts developers, decentralized applications (dApps), and users. A more active network increases transaction volume and fees, strengthening Ripple Payments to support its financial sustainability. Driving Investment Interest and ETF Development As XRP’s market value rises, it becomes increasingly attractive to venture capitalists, institutional investors, and ETF issuers. The recent filing of an XRP ETF by WisdomTree for 2025 indicates growing institutional confidence. Moreover, the token’s price performance can indicate the network’s health and technological robustness. This strengthens Ripple’s reputation beyond being just another cryptocurrency, positioning it as a serious player in enterprise financial infrastructure. Maintaining a Competitive Edge Ripple leverages XRP to distinguish itself from competitors like SWIFT and Stellar in the competitive space of global payment solutions. A strong XRP price matches the competition and provides Ripple with a performance advantage that supports faster and more scalable growth. Additionally, a widely adopted and valuable token is less susceptible to regulatory risks, enhancing XRP’s case for legitimacy in the financial industry. The analysis shared by “All Things XRP” echoes a growing consensus within the community. They believe Ripple’s success is closely linked to XRP’s market performance. Far from diminishing XRP’s importance, the company appears to rely on its rising price to fund its operations and support its expansion plans, countering concerns that Ripple might favour its stablecoin over XRP.

Now, Arthur Hayes is predicting that the apex crypto will rocket to $1 million in just three years, thanks to macro tailwinds. The former BitMEX CEO reiterated his uber-bullish forecast in his latest blog post. $1 Million Bitcoin ‘Sometime Between Now And 2028’ Arthur Hayes suggested that Bitcoin could surge to seven figures in a few years, owing to strong tailwinds including a likely outflow of foreign investment and devaluation of the huge stock of the US Treasury, suggesting that Bitcoin will become the preferred haven for investors everywhere. “Foreign capital repatriation and the devaluation of the gargantuan stock of U.S. treasuries will be the two catalysts that will power Bitcoin to $1 million sometime between now and 2028,” the BitMEX founder said in his May 15 blog. Hayes timed his forecast to the next US presidential election when a less crypto-friendly president might assume office. “I say 2028, because that is when the next US presidential election occurs, and who knows what type of politician will win and what policies they will enact,” he wrote. “Maybe by some stroke of divine intervention, the American public is ready to accept the monetary hangover for the profligacy of the last century and extinguish the rotten credit destroying their society,” the crypto OG said. “Therefore, the time is now to make hay while the sun king takes a shine to Bitcoin.” Bitcoin Is The “Perfect And Only Lifeboat” Hayes, who was pardoned in late March by U.S. President Trump after having pleaded guilty in 2022 to violations of the Bank Secrecy Act, went on to suggest that Trump will shift gears from tariffs to capital control. This will spook investors, who Hayes thinks will exit the United States with their capital. He reckons the US will print more money in a form similar to quantitative easing to make up for capital leaving the U.S. “It’s the same answer as always,” said Hayes. “If the foreigners won’t supply the dollars, the government will by using its printing press.” As a result, he believes President Trump is likely to shift policies, which will ultimately be a boon for Bitcoin. “Bitcoin is the perfect and only lifeboat for global capital that must leave America and elsewhere,” Hayes postulated. Hayes has often maintained that Bitcoin will end up taking off like a rocket due to the U.S.’s monetary policy of printing cash.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-17 07:13:37

Cardano’s blockchain integration with Brave’s 85 million users sparks fresh momentum. XRP rides a bullish wave after dodging a bearish trap, with prices eyeing $3.40. These crypto predictions make investing worthwhile. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi newcomer, is drawing intense demand, raising $8,500,000 with over 476 million tokens sold to 10,000 holders since its presale began. These assets, each with distinct strengths, offer a clear path for investors seeking the best crypto to buy now. Cardano’s Brave Boost Cardano (ADA) is gaining traction as a top crypto to invest in, fueled by its recent integration with Brave’s multi-chain wallet. This move exposes Cardano’s blockchain to Brave’s 85 million users, opening doors for new interactions. Priced at $0.83, ADA has climbed 60% from April lows of $0.51, signaling a robust recovery. A retest of 2024 highs near $1.30 looms if altcoin season ignites. Long-term, Cardano’s focus on decentralization and projects like BitcoinOS could push it toward $3. Yet, compared to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), ADA’s ecosystem lags in DeFi adoption, making it a slower burn for short-term gains. XRP’s Bullish Breakout XRP is charging forward, cementing its place among the best cryptos to buy. A failed head-and-shoulders pattern in April, where prices dipped to $1.60 before reclaiming $2, has bulls in control. Now trading above $2.50, XRP eyes its January high of $3.40, with some analysts predicting $2.85 by June. High trading volumes and a crypto-friendly U.S. administration bolster confidence. While XRP’s cross-border transaction utility shines, it lacks the DeFi innovation of Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Still, its momentum makes it a strong pick for investors asking, “What crypto to buy now?” for rapid returns. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Surge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is capturing attention as a new cryptocurrency with explosive potential. Its presale, now in phase 4 at $0.025, is 80% filled, with phase 5 set to raise the price by 20% to $0.03, delivering a 20% gain for current investors. The opening phase sold at $0.01, and early buyers of this crypto coin are already up significantly. At launch, tokenomics project a $0.06 listing price, yielding a 140% return for phase 4 investors. Analysts forecast a post-launch surge to $2.50, a 9,900% leap, making MUTM a top crypto to buy now for massive gains. Mutuum’s DeFi Edge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands apart with its lending and borrowing platform, offering real utility over speculative tokens. Users deposit assets like ETH to receive mtTokens, which accrue interest for passive income. A buy-and-distribute system uses platform revenue to repurchase MUTM tokens, rewarding stakes and driving demand. The team is finalizing a Certik smart contract audit, and the results will soon be shared on social media. Recently, Mutuum launched a dashboard showcasing the top 50 holders, who earn bonus tokens for maintaining their rank, adding excitement to the cheapest cryptocurrency in its presale. Racing to the Top Cardano (ADA), XRP, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) each offer unique paths to profit in 2025’s crypto market. Cardano’s user base expansion and XRP’s price momentum make them solid picks for investors seeking the best cryptocurrency to invest in. However, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) steals the spotlight with its presale success and DeFi utility, poised for a 23x return at $2.50 post-launch. Phase 4’s rapid sellout signals urgency. Investors wondering which crypto to buy today for short-term gains should act fast.

Did the Team Cash Out and Abandon the Community?,https://coinpedia.org/news/pi-network-rug-pull-did-the-team-cash-out-and-abandon-the-community/,"The post Pi Network Rug Pull? Did the Team Cash Out and Abandon the Community? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Pi Network launched a $100M fund to support real-world Pi Coin projects, but despite the bullish intent, the coin’s price dropped post-announcement, disappointing investors. Post the event, the Pi Network is under fire as crypto analyst Dr Altcoin accuses the Pi Core Team of misleading the community and orchestrating a quiet rug pull. In a recent exposé, he claims that the team used hype and misleading narratives to boost Pi’s price while quietly cashing out at the top. Pi Coin Community Feels Betrayed Amid Missing Utility Analyst highlighted a March video in which the co-founder’s wife stated it took six years to build the Pi ecosystem and ensure its utility. However, he argues that the real utility and decentralized apps (DApps) are still in development and are only now being funded through Pi Network Ventures . This new funding arm was launched on May 14, when many were expecting a full mainnet release, leaving supporters disappointed. According to the analyst, the Pi Core Team leveraged its user base, referred to as “Pioneers”, for free promotion up until funding was secured. But now, the team has stopped using the term altogether. Adding to the community’s concerns, it was recently revealed that all Pi coins were pre-mined, something users were unaware of, and most KYC processes are now handled by AI. Most importantly, Pi’s core team holds 89% of the token supply , making users worry about a possible dump like what happened with Terra Luna. Pi Coin Price Crash Moreover, he alleges that the Core Team created hype leading up to the Consensus 2025 event, pushing Pi’s price from $0.40 to $1.60 with promises of a vibrant Pi Ecosystem and 100 ready-to-launch DApps. But behind the scenes, the team is believed to have sold tens, if not hundreds, of millions worth of Pi tokens at the top, while users remained distracted by optimistic updates. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Pi Network Will Take Years to Deliver Real Value, Warns Analyst , Since then, Pi has dropped nearly 50%, now trading around $0.80 and possibly heading back to $0.40.

The signal comes from Ethereum’s ETH/BTC Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) metric, a gauge of relative valuation that measures market sentiment and historical trading patterns. Historically, whenever this indicator has reached similarly low levels, ETH has subsequently delivered significant gains and substantially outperformed BTC. Investors appear to be taking notice. Demand for the ETH ETF has sharply picked up, with the ETH/BTC ETF holdings ratio rising steeply since late April, according to data from CryptoQuant. This shift in allocation suggests institutional investors anticipate ETH will outperform BTC, potentially fueled by the recent Pectra upgrade or a more favorable macroeconomic environment. Already, the ETH/BTC price ratio has rebounded 38% from its weakest level since January 2020, suggesting investors and traders are betting the bottom is in and an ""alt season"" could soon follow. This echoes what some market participants have been telling CoinDesk. March Zheng, General Partner of Bizantine Capital, said in a recent message that traders should remember that ETH has typically been the main on-chain altcoin indicator for risk-on, and its sizable upticks generally lead to broader altcoin rallies. On-chain data further supports this optimism. ETH spot trading volume relative to BTC surged to 0.89 last week, its highest since August 2024, signaling renewed appetite from investors. A similar trend occurred between 2019 and 2021, when ETH went on to outperform BTC by fourfold. CryptoQuant also notes that ETH exchange deposits, often an indicator of selling pressure, have dropped to their lowest relative level since 2020, implying investors anticipate higher prices ahead. For now, confirmation hinges on ETH decisively breaking above its key 365-day moving average against BTC. Still, with compelling undervaluation, rising institutional interest, and diminishing selling pressure, ETH appears positioned for significant upside in the coming months. But one thing ETH is still lagging on is network activity, as CryptoQuant flagged in a prior report . Without more people using Ethereum, it will be tough for the token's price to lift off and head to the moon.",Markets|ETH|CryptoQuant|News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-17 07:25:42

Renowned crypto enthusiast Michael van de Poppe recently pointed out that Chainlink was about to run to $20. Source: Michael van de Poppe Market analyst Stanley Crypto also shared similar sentiments and stated, “LINK is retesting the breakout zone from the ascending triangle. Price is holding above key support around $16.20. A bounce here could ignite a move toward the $22.85 target.” Source: Stanley Crypto What are the stakes of Chainlink hitting $20? Well, the altcoin will need to breach major resistance at $17.80 because this zone recently emerged as an impediment to Chainlink’s jump to $20. LINK will also need to hold the critical support zone at $16.20. According to CoinGecko data, Chainlink was up by 34.9% in the past month to hit $15.52 when writing. Chainlink is Calling the Shots in DeFi Development When it comes to the top DeFi project in terms of development, Chainlink has emerged the victor per Santiment data . Source: Santiment Having risen to prominence as a blockchain abstraction layer that permits the universal connection of smart contracts, Chainlink continues to rank high in developer contributions and GitHub commits. This explains why Chainlink was recently selected by top banking giant JPMorgan to settle tokenized U.S. Treasuries, whereby public and private blockchains were bridged. Furthermore, Chainlink’s high development activity can be linked to the numerous integration of gaming, non-fungible token (NFT) and DeFi projects. Meanwhile, bullish momentum is expected to continue engulfing the Chainlink ecosystem, thanks to the surfacing of an inverse head and shoulders pattern.",Cryptocurrency|News|ChainLink|Link,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|LINK|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-17 07:26:50

Here’s The Potential Timeline and What It Could Mean For Rival Payment Tokens XLM and RTX,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-to-100-heres-the-potential-timeline-and-what-it-could-mean/,"XRP ’s bullish momentum has reignited talk of a $100 price target, a bold prediction that has analysts divided but investors intrigued. If achieved, it would mark one of the most explosive moves in crypto history, reshaping the digital payments space. But what would such a leap mean for rival payment tokens like Stellar ( XLM ) and rising star Remittix (RTX) ? Here’s the timeline experts are watching and what could unfold next. Stellar ( XLM ) signals fresh rally ahead Stellar ( XLM ) is making waves again, driven by its mission to make global finance more inclusive, particularly in underserved regions. Focused on fast, affordable cross-border payments, XLM recently surged 1.7%, reaching $0.2982. This rally follows a clean breakout from a double bottom pattern, a classic technical sign of a trend reversal after prolonged sideways action. Source: CoinMarketCap During the last bull run, XLM soared from $0.09 to $0.50 a staggering gain. With renewed momentum and growing market interest, analysts are eyeing a potential repeat performance. With its strong fundamentals and a fresh wave of bullish energy, XLM is one token that deserves serious attention in the weeks ahead. Ripple lawsuit twist adds fuel to XRP rally toward $5 In a dramatic turn in the SEC vs. Ripple saga , Judge Analisa Torres has rejected a joint motion from both parties that aimed to pave the way for settlement. Attorney Bill Morgan explained that while the settlement process had progressed, it unraveled at the fourth stage due to a procedural misstep, prompting the court to request a re-filing under the correct rule. Despite the legal detour, XRP is showing strong technical momentum. XRP broke through the $2.26 pivot level and is now eyeing $2.52 as the next key target. If bullish momentum continues, resistance levels beyond that could open the door to $3, potentially $5, with enough market force. Source: CoinMarketCap A notable uptick in whale activity supports the XRP rally. On-chain data reveals that wallets holding one to ten million XRP have steadily increased their share, signaling growing conviction among large investors. With legal clarity inching closer and strong fundamentals at play, XRP may be gearing up for one of its most significant price runs. Remittix presale heats up as investors rush into the next big crypto-to-fiat powerhouse Remittix is quickly becoming the go-to name in crypto-to-fiat innovation, and investors are making bold moves to secure their position. It’s not hype; Remittix is delivering a real-world solution that finally makes crypto usable for everyday people.

From freelancers to merchants, its utility spans far beyond speculation. And the market is responding fast. The presale has already raised over $15 million , with RTX tokens now priced at $0.0757 and over two-thirds of the supply sold. Remittix is gunning for giants like Stripe and Coinbase, but it’s doing it with a leaner, faster and far more crypto-native solution. Conclusion With a 500% price rise already under its belt and strong momentum as altcoins surge back to life, Remittix is turning out to be 2025’s standout performer over XLM and XRP . For those watching from the sidelines, the window is shrinking fast. If current momentum holds, getting in now could be one of the smartest moves of the year.

Gulf tech deals boost U.S. dollar stability and deepen U.S.-China strategic balance. Stablecoin wallets grew 53% in one year, showing rising crypto adoption globally. During his recent Middle East trip, President Donald Trump declared that “a lot of good things are going to happen over the next month.” This statement comes as the administration focuses on new economic agreements, global trade, and what it views as rapid, positive developments in cryptocurrency regulation. Trump’s upbeat forecast is partly fueled by reported breakthroughs in trade discussions with both the United Kingdom and China. Beyond these specific talks, the White House plans to avoid case-by-case negotiations by informing trading partners of new terms for doing business in the United States within the coming weeks.

No more lower highs. No more hesitation. Just clean, bullish momentum and a technical structure screaming Wave 5. According to Elliott Wave analysts, that final push could send XRP soaring to $5.86. But here’s the twist: while XRP charges ahead with billions in volume and regulatory clarity finally on its side, a lesser-known token dubbed “XRP 2.0” is quietly gathering steam. It’s faster. It’s lighter. And if XRP’s Wave 5 projection plays out, this underdog could deliver outsized returns, up to 2,500%, according to early adopters tracing the same pattern. The story unfolding now isn’t just about XRP reclaiming its place in the top three. It’s about whether this next-gen remittance coin can ride the same wave and maybe even outpace it. XRP eyes $5.86 as wave 5 kicks off, and the charts aren’t bluffing After months of slow bleed and uncertainty, XRP finally broke free, blasting above $2.36 and ending a stubborn three-month downtrend . For traders who’ve been following the charts closely, this wasn’t just a lucky bounce. It was a textbook signal. A clean break above resistance, supported by spiking volume and firm footing at $1.79. Suddenly, XRP wasn’t just another altcoin. It was a setup. Source: JackTheRipple Enter Elliott Wave theory, a method used by analysts to map market psychology through wave patterns. According to seasoned chart watchers like Dark Defender, XRP is now entering Wave 5 of its current cycle. And if this wave unfolds like previous cycles, the target is bold: $5.86. Wave 1 took the XRP price from $0.50 to $2.30. Wave 2 corrected. Wave 3 launched near $3.70. Wave 4 brought it back to $2.10. Now, Wave 5 is forming, with a projected climb driven by market sentiment and historical Fibonacci levels. RSI indicators are beginning to turn bullish again, just like they did before previous rallies. In this context, $5.86 isn’t hype, it’s a calculated outcome. And with structural support holding and momentum building, XRP’s next leg could be its most powerful yet. The charts, it seems, are finally ready to tell a new story. Why XRP’s breakout could send ‘xrp 2.0’ Remittix soaring by 2500% While XRP pushes toward $5.86, a quiet contender is building the rails for what comes next. Enter Remittix, dubbed by early adopters as “XRP 2.0” and not just for its mission, but for how it’s executing it. If XRP’s rally signals a renewed appetite for crypto-powered payments, Remittix could be the real beneficiary, with upside potential that makes 2500% gains a real possibility. Source: Remittix Why?

If XRP proves the use case, Remittix is the upgrade, rewiring the payment layer with smoother UX, more coverage and unstoppable compliance. Conclusion: Remittix rises as XRP ignites Wave 5 As XRP sets its sights on $5.86 with bullish momentum and clear technical signals, Remittix is positioning itself as the faster, smarter evolution, XRP 2.0. With over 534 million RTX tokens sold and 87% of its presale already snapped up, momentum is real.

While Bitcoin breaks the $100,000 mark and Ethereum powers decentralized finance (DeFi) adoption, the focus has shifted to undervalued altcoins. Penny cryptocurrencies priced under $1 are catching eyes as they offer the potential for massive growth. Among them stands out Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) , an Ethereum-based meme coin with a unique twist. Powered by artificial intelligence and priced at just $0.004, this penny crypto delivers an intriguing mix of fun and innovation. If you're looking for the next breakout crypto, here’s why Dawgz AI deserves your attention. Why Invest in Crypto Now Optimism swirls around the cryptocurrency market as May 2025 unfolds. Bitcoin's $100,000 milestone has sparked renewed interest in altcoins, particularly those with strong fundamentals and low entry costs. Ethereum, the backbone of DeFi, has surpassed $62 billion in total value locked (TVL), according to DeFiLlama. This demonstrates growing blockchain adoption. Meanwhile, institutional inflows and macroeconomic changes, like potential tax reforms, add fuel to an anticipated extended bull run. What makes now ideal for investing? The broader crypto market is bullish. Altcoins are gathering momentum. Penny cryptos offer accessible entry for both new and seasoned investors. But remember, it’s not about chasing hype. Investors need to focus on cryptocurrencies with real-world utility, solid communities, and transparent systems. What to Look for in the Best Crypto to Buy Now To identify the best penny cryptos , evaluate these critical factors: Utility and innovation: Does the project solve problems or offer unique technology? Ethereum remains dominant because its smart contracts revolutionized DeFi and Web3. Market trends: Current winners align with mid-2025 trends like artificial intelligence and meme culture. Tokenomics: Transparent distribution models create long-term sustainability. Community engagement: A strong and supportive user base drives adoption and price growth. Security: Verified smart contracts, like Dawgz AI's SolidProof-audited code , provide peace of mind. Applying these criteria, Dawgz AI emerges as a promising contender combining sharp AI innovation with meme coin excitement. Why Dawgz AI Stands Out Priced at just $0.004, Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) offers a strong value proposition. Launched in 2024, its goal is to transform the memecoin space by integrating AI to create meaningful functionality. Key Features of Dawgz AI AI-Powered Trading: Sophisticated algorithms designed to maximize gains for token holders by analyzing market data around the clock. Community-Centric Growth: A vibrant “Dawgz Army” supports the project with meme contests and interactive events. Strong Tokenomics: 30% allocated to presale, ensuring early investors secure discounted prices. 20% dedicated to staking rewards to encourage long-term holding. 15% for community-driven incentives like contests. 10% for liquidity pools, ensuring smooth trading. The team has created a clearly structured roadmap, including phases targeting community growth and global outreach. This sets up Dawgz AI for both short-term gains and sustained momentum. Dawgz AI and the Power of Penny Cryptos Penny cryptos like Dawgz AI hold a distinct advantage. Their low market cap allows for exponential growth with relatively small inflows of capital. History shows that similar tokens have delivered 1000x gains during bull cycles when supported by innovation and strong community backing.

Dawgz AI could follow a similar trajectory, leveraging its AI-powered foundation and meme-driven marketing strategy.

The broader crypto market held at $3.3 trillion, paring earlier gains after briefly touching the week’s high. The move came after rating giant Moody’s cut the U.S. sovereign credit rating to Aa1 from Aaa, citing the country’s swelling deficits, rising interest expenses, and a lack of political will to rein in spending. The firm now joins Fitch and S&P in assigning a rating below the once-unblemished triple-A status long held by the world’s largest economy. As such, the White House was quick to respond, with spokespersons for President Donald Trump criticizing the decision as politically motivated. The downgrade had an immediate effect on traditional markets: U.S. Treasury yields jumped, with the 10-year note rising to 4.49%, while S&P 500 futures dipped 0.6% in after-hours trading. Historically, concerns about U.S. debt sustainability and dollar debasement have served as tailwinds for bitcoin and other decentralized assets. However, credit downgrades can also trigger short-term risk-off behavior, particularly if macro uncertainty leads institutional traders to reduce exposure. Meanwhile, some traders warned of a deeper sell-off in the near term on general profit-taking before the next rally. “Bitcoin is holding the $104,000 mark as a key level and the positive factor is that sellers have not yet managed to seize control of the market,” Alex Kuptsikevich, the FxPro chief market analyst, told CoinDesk in an email. “However, resilience at high levels may be temporary before the next bounce, and there is considerable pressure near the upper boundary of the current range.” “In other words, the short-term outlook suggests a decline from current levels,” Kuptsikevich opined.",Markets|News,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|ETH|MARKET|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-17 07:54:38

At the end of the three-day BCH Bliss 2025 conference in Ljubljana, Slovenia, participants are fired up about the improved P2P engine, adoption, real-world utility, and privacy in an often vapid, strictly number-go-up crypto climate. In the wake of the Bitcoin Cash 2025 network upgrade two days ago, and the coinciding celebration at the BCH Bliss conference in Slovenia, devs, entrepreneurs, merchants, and BCH users are wending their way back out into the normie, fiat world to spread the now ages-old (in crypto years) gospel of Satoshi.The Bitcoin Cash network has a relatively short but turbulent history, and one which is in some respects unrivaled as far as community enthusiasm, philosophy, and principle. Recent years have seen striking unity and focus, with the addition of smart contracts via the 2023 CashTokens upgrade, and a flourishing of new wallets, protocols, and products. The 2024 Adjustive Blocksize Limit Algorithm (ABLA) further cemented this trend, allowing for the network capacity to adjust automatically to use.While Bliss speakers noted that network usage is nowhere close to where they want it to be, what’s notable about BCH is that it is still actually used as permissionless, peer-to-peer cash, in a sea of market-cap-leading cryptos that have become little more than speculative gambling. BCH Bliss 2025, focused on network utility and speed John Nieri, president of General Protocols, the UTXO blockchain development company behind the popular BCH Bull DeFi platform , told Cryptopolitan: “This is the beginning of the age of the BCH entrepreneur.” Nieri, known as Emergent Reasons in the community, said of the 2025 network change:“The engine has been seriously upgraded. There are more coming, but the power available now is enough to move mountains. Next we need wallets and apps that put that power into the the hands of a huge number of people and organizations.” Left to right: BCH Bliss organizer and Bitcoin Cash Podcast founder Jeremy and BCH developers Dagur Valberg, Mathieu Geukens, and Kallisti talk on a panel on day three of BCH Bliss 2025 in Ljubljana, Solvenia. The upgrades Nieri speaks of are dovetailing CHIPs (Cash Improvement Proposals), which deal with virtual-machine limits and larger integers, streamlining smart-contract capability and efficiency on BCH. While the network has enjoyed UTXO-based smart contract functionality since 2023, according to developer Jason Dreyzehner, the now-live 2025 VELMA upgrade opens up use cases such as, “More advanced automated market making and exchange protocols, decentralized stablecoins, collateralized loan protocols, cross-chain and sidechain bridges, zero-knowledge proofs, post-quantum cryptography, homomorphic encryption, and more.”Mathieu Geukens, Cashonize wallet and Cauldron DEX developer, said on day three of the conference: “I think it just removes headache for developers. Because for example, with Cauldron, we were discussing at some point like an overflow behavior where if you have a lot of tokens and a lot of BCH in a micro-pool … you can only go up to 64-bit integers — then your financial contracts you have to worry about. You have to consider, ‘oh can it overflow, will the transaction just fail?’ And that just removed this headache and worry.” General Protocols’ BCH Bull DeFi hedging and leveraging protocol. Synthetic assets and the battle for privacy and adoption The Bitcoin Cash community is known for its passionate support of values also held by Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto. Permissionlessness. Anonymity. Separation of money and state.Kallisti, a developer of the Selene Wallet for Bitcoin Cash, which also supports CashTokens NFTs on the network, shared his thoughts on day three of Bliss, on being publicly verifiable, and the state of crypto in the USA under a Trump regime: “Just because you’re doxxed doesn’t mean that you’re trustworthy. Not necessarily … I think it’d be great to have more anons in the community … As far as government crackdown and what not, in some degree I don’t feel the fear as much in the US and on the other hand the current US administration is very unpredictable, so we never know if tomorrow they just decide, ‘yeah we’re just gonna ban crypto’ even though Trump was in the BTC Nashville conference last year and praising everything about BTC right — but politicians are always just saying what we wanna hear, right?” Kallisti’s comments came in reply to the thoughts of Dagur Valberg, a dev behind the Moria USD (MUSD) stablecoin on Bitcoin Cash, who lamented the extremely draconian situation for crypto privacy currently unfolding in the European Union. Valberg noted that he does fear being attacked by the state, saying: “Oh it’s definitely kind of risky, especially in the EU,” continuing: “There’s a lot of regulatory stuff coming up and you never know if the governments are going to retroactively punish you. You just have to hope they’re not. It would definitely be better to be anonymous, and if I had the option to choose again I would be anonymous.” Tickets to the conference came in the form of VELMA (Virtual Machine Limits & [BigInt] Arithmetic) NFTs on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain. Geukens, for his part, added, “By 2027 they want to have all privacy coins banned in the EU,” with BCH Bliss organizer and Bitcoin Cash Podcast Host Jeremy noting that doxxing and popular support can be a kind of “double-edged sword.” Self-labeled Agorist and popular social media personality Sal Mayweather was also in attendance, and said one area BCH needs to improve on is privacy. This has been a common theme echoed by others, but typically overlooks the already active and easy to use CashFusion protocol available for Bitcoin Cash, as well as improvements on the horizon which could leverage covenants to run XMR and other privacy tech directly onchain. As dev Dreyzener noted back in January: “Covenants already enable any ‘layer 1’ technology: zkVMs, Monero (inc. Full-Chain Membership Proofs), Zcash, Mimblewimble, etc. The 2026 proposals make these truly practical: from messy, multi-MB transaction chains to cheap, atomic transactions sent from any wallet.”Another important metric for privacy and autonomy is adoption via decentralized markets of tokenized “synthetic assets.” The unveiling of a new stablecoin and loan protocol called ParityUSD generated marked interest at Bliss. Tokyo Bitcoin Cash Meetup organizer BigV shared his thoughts with Cryptopolitan on this model’s potential. “The parity/overcollateralized loan approach is interesting to me as it can be used to create synthetic assets to track anything — not just dollars but gold, or anything (e.g. trad-fi securities like stocks, commodities, indexes),” he said, continuing: “Then we could create anonymous and permissionless synthetic markets open to everyone — which could theoretically enable normal people in all countries and those with limited wealth to participate in massive unregulated markets that compete directly with the regulated ones dominated by banking cartels. So we could end up having huge synthetic markets, run by ordinary folks, being the tail that wags the trad-fi dog!” Pain points, solutions, and the road forward BCH Bliss attendees and speakers were not afraid to confront the realities of the present: draconian regulation, crypto being bought up and co-opted by politicians and banksters, relatively low network usage, and the ever pressing need for greater and greater privacy to stay ahead of entities seeking to stifle economic freedom. The controversial social media personality Mayweather also spoke words that — regardless of the speaker — resonated with Voluntaryists, Agorists, and anarchists everywhere, emphasizing a decided antipathy toward fiat-pegged stablecoins, and a laser focus on privacy and permissionless, P2P transactions. BCH Guru NFTs on tapswap.cash. Valberg expressed some reservations about potential downfalls of loop implementation in the codebase, and Geukens addressed the topic of network bloat via non-standard use of transactions, which could be enabled by the Pay to Script CHIP currently on the table. Geukens pointed to the popular Ordinal inscriptions NFT trend which has been clogging up the already congested rival network BTC in recent years, and driving up fees. Currently BCH non-fungible tokens have metadata stored off-chain, but onchain storage would become easier with the future removal of bytecode limitations. Kallisti expressed a desire to keep BCH mining somewhat standardized and the network efficient, while Valberg said he was not a fan of storing art directly onchain. Geukens detailed: “It is a nuanced debate, and reasonable people could fall on either side. So I think one thing is that you don’t need to go from 220 bytes to no limit at all. We could do like steps and see, reevaluate. Also, the filters they do work to some extent. You have Mara Slipstream on BTC. But on BCH I don’t think we have any kind of service, so if you wanted to put your current token metadata fully onchain that would be non-standard, so you would have to team up with a miner. This is a real hurdle, so that’s why we don’t see it. But if you remove this hurdle and it becomes 10x easier then people will definitely do it.” Jeremy noted the voluntary and permissionless nature of the chain as a data storage network for anyone willing to pay the fees, but asked about potential community battles fought over the so-called proper use of the network — whether it is about P2P cash first and foremost, and not arbitrary jpeg storage.To learn more about the CHIPs process and future Bitcoin Cash upgrades, please see this resource .

The rise of Bitcoin and Ethereum has set a solid foundation, but smaller, low-cost altcoins are now stealing the spotlight in 2025. These affordable tokens hold tantalizing potential for high returns with a much smaller initial investment. This post dives into why altcoins under $1 are booming this year. We’ll also review some intriguing options that are buzzing among crypto enthusiasts, including Dawgz AI , a standout presale token making waves. Plus, we’ll uncover a chilling $250M crypto scam to shed light on how to bet wisely on altcoins while avoiding big pitfalls. The Lesson From a $250M Crypto Mistake Before we jump into wallet-worthy altcoins, a quick cautionary tale. Back in 2018, Gerald Cotten, then CEO of the Canadian crypto exchange QuadrigaCX, passed away unexpectedly. Tragically, he took the keys to $250M in crypto assets to his grave. Investigations later uncovered that he had been moving customer funds to his personal accounts, leaving investors in ruin. This scandal serves as a stark reminder for crypto investors to choose platforms with transparency, security, and sound audit histories. Audited projects like Dawgz AI, SolidProof approved, ensure your altcoin investments are safeguarded against such risks. Why Altcoins Under $1 Are Skyrocketing This Year Altcoins priced under $1 are no longer underdogs; they’re rising stars in 2025. But why is this sector getting so much attention? Here’s what’s driving interest: Affordability Tokens priced under $1 are accessible to everyday investors. These low costs also make it easy to diversify portfolios and stack up on volumes. Sectors Like AI and Gaming Emerging industries such as AI, blockchain gaming, and decentralized finance are driving significant interest in altcoins. Perceived Upside Potential Investors feel it’s easier for a coin priced at $0.01 to hit $1 than for Bitcoin to double its current value. While this psychology doesn’t guarantee returns, it stirs excitement and demand. Platforms like Reddit and X (formerly Twitter) are amplifying this momentum as investors share analysis and success stories, stirring further grassroots buzz around sub-$1 altcoins. Best Altcoins to Buy Under $1 in 2025 Now, let's shift focus to three of the best altcoins to buy this year. These are not just backed by hype but are showcasing utility, strong narratives, and tech-driven features that appeal to today’s investors. Dawgz AI Adding Bark to the Altcoin Buzz At just $0.004, Dawgz AI is packing serious utility into a fun, meme-friendly package. This rapidly rising token is redefining the meme coin space by adding meaningful DeFi tools like AI-powered trading bots, staking rewards, and a community-centric model. It’s already raised over $3.45M during its presale, nearing its $3.61M target. What Makes Dawgz AI Unique? AI Trading Bots These bots run 24/7, enabling high-frequency trading and potential profits while you sleep. Low Entry Point Affordable at $0.004 with multi-network compatibility (ETH, SOL, BNB). Staking Rewards Earn extra tokens by staking early and holding long-term. Audit-Proven Fully audited by SolidProof for safety and transparency. Meme Energy Meets DeFi Utility While it wears a “meme” tag, Dawgz AI goes above and beyond with real-world tech applications. For those looking to catch early-stage winners, $DAGZ is shaping up as a strong contender. Bonus tip? Watch YouTube reviews for an even deeper analysis. Dogecoin Oldie but Goodie A list of hot altcoins isn’t complete without mentioning Dogecoin (DOGE) . Priced at $0.22 today, this meme classic remains a go-to for traders. Frequent social media buzz, community-driven momentum, and occasional Elon Musk mentions keep keeping Dogecoin relevant. Here’s why it’s still worth attention: Volume Leader DOGE continues to clock over $1B in daily trading volume. Community Power Its loyal fanbase ensures Dogecoin always makes waves when crypto trends shift. While it lacks a utility focus like Dawgz AI, Dogecoin's nostalgia and market presence make it hard to ignore. Cardano Tech-First and Affordable If you’re after smart contract gems, Cardano (ADA) might be your pick. Trading at $0.77, this blockchain titan is firmly in 2025's top 10 cryptocurrencies. Its use cases in DeFi and governance systems exemplify innovation, making it an intriguing mix of scalability and sustainability. Why invest in Cardano? Fixed Token Supply A limit of 45 billion total ADA enforces scarcity, appealing to long-term holders. Ecosystem Growth Cardano is consistently expanding, especially in areas like decentralized finance (DeFi). If you’re after a blend of stability and innovation, ADA offers a reliable selection beneath the $1 mark. Top Tips When Buying Altcoins The $250M QuadrigaCX story reminds us how critical diligence is in crypto. Here are practical tips to keep your investments safe: Research Thoroughly - Check whitepapers, roadmaps, and team backgrounds. Stick to Audited Projects - Avoid platforms without security checks. Verified tokens like Dawgz AI give you confidence. Monitor Liquidity and Community - Active forums, Telegram chats, and trading volume indicate strong community support. Plan Entry and Exit - Know your goals early to avoid panic dumping. Start with Smart Picks Today Navigating the altcoin space doesn’t have to leave you overwhelmed. By focusing on affordable, transparent, and utility-backed coins, you can make smarter bets and potentially enjoy steep returns. If you’ve been waiting for the right moment to start, don’t miss the Dawgz AI presale while entries are low. Build your portfolio, invest wisely, and join the Dawgz revolution. FAQs Section Which altcoin could see 1000x growth? Tokens like Dawgz AI with early-stage presales, AI integration, and innovative staking features carry high upside potential. What’s the best altcoin to invest in now? New entries like Dawgz AI are making significant noise, especially with transparent audits and low entry points.

Key Highlights: Pi Coin is down 45% from its recent high, currently trading at $0.6984. Market cap rose 95% in 5 days and then dropped $3.7B within 3 days. Top 100 wallet concentration fell from 98.76% to under 5% from May 6 to May 16. EMAs at $0.79–$0.85 have turned into resistance, confirming bearish momentum. Analyst outlook remains cautiously bearish amid fading indicators and failed support. Pi Network (PI) is currently trading at $0.6984, down over 45% from its recent high of $1.57 with market cap now at $5.1B. From May 8 to May 13, Pi’s market cap jumped from $4.5B to $8.8B, almost doubling in just five days. But by May 16, it had fallen back to $5.1B, losing over $3.7B in value in just three days. This sharp drop came after a short-lived price boost caused by major announcements — including the shutdown of Pi’s central node and the launch of a $100M Pi Network Ventures fund, both revealed during Consensus 2025 (May 13–14). The fast rise and fall show that Pi’s price still reacts quickly to news rather than steady growth. While the rally briefly caught market attention, the rapid drop has heightened caution among traders. PI/USDT Technical Analysis: Indicators Show Weak Momentum and Bearish Bias The rally that started on May 8 lifted Pi above $1, peaking at $1.57 on May 13 , driven by major news. But buying power faded just as fast. Now, Pi trades under the 20, 50, 100, and 200-day EMAs — stacked between $0.79–$0.85 — which have flipped into resistance. The MACD has turned bearish, with the line almost crossing below the signal. The histogram, though not yet red, is narrowing, signalling fading buying pressure. The RSI , now at 42 , points to neutral-to-bearish momentum. The On-Balance Volume (OBV) , which reflects buying vs. selling pressure, has dropped over 12% from its recent high , indicating a slowdown in net accumulation. Resistance sits at $0.79–$0.85. Pi Coin is now testing key support levels at $0.68 and $0.59, which were important price zones before the rally on May 8. Instead of moving sideways in a range, the price has dropped from the peak and is now settling where buyers previously stepped in, waiting for a fresh trigger to move again . A fall below $0.59 could open the way to $0.45 . The Analysis of the PI network remains cautiously bearish unless Pi reclaims its EMAs with strong volume. Pi On-Chain Metrics: Wallet Concentration Shift and Volume Drop Volume surged to $2.2B on May 12 , then dropped to $588M by May 16 , down 73% , suggesting a fading hype cycle. The CoinCarp chart, which displays wallet distribution by holder ranks, shows that the Top 100 wallet concentration dropped sharply from 98.76% on May 6 to 14.76% by May 13 , before settling under 5% by May 16 . On May 13 specifically, the top 10 holders owned just 1.31% , and the top 50 held 2.7% . This dramatic shift likely reflects internal wallet reshuffling rather than actual retail distribution. The rapid redistribution during the rally aligns with bearish technical indicators, showing that major holders possibly took profits during the hype phase.. Conclusion: Event-Reactive Sentiment Keeps Pi Coin Volatile Pi Network’s 45% rally and the subsequent steep correction were driven by short-lived hype , notably from announcements made during Consensus 2025 (May 13–14) . This reflects how event-based sentiment still drives Pi’s price more than fundamental progress. The rapid market cap swing — a $3.7B decline in just three days — reveals how sensitive Pi remains to major headlines. Going forward, potential catalysts such as a mainnet activation or ecosystem adoption could reignite interest. Until then, Pi Coin is likely to continue trading on speculative momentum , and traders should monitor support zones closely for further downside risk or relief bounce attempts.",Price Analysis|Crypto news,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-17 08:12:14

Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Solana: The High-Speed Contender Shaking Up the Blockchain World Solana is a blockchain platform that puts speed first. Competing with Ethereum and Cardano, it offers a foundation for decentralized applications (dapps) with a focus on scalability. Its architecture allows for faster transactions and lets developers use multiple programming languages. SOL, Solana's native cryptocurrency, powers transactions, runs custom programs, and rewards network supporters. Unlike some platforms, Solana avoids sharding or second-layer solutions for scalability. It scales on-chain, making it attractive for developers building high-activity products and services. In the current market cycle, Solana has gained attention for its high-capacity network and potential to support a wide array of projects. As the blockchain world evolves, Solana's technology and performance may position it as a strong player among its peers. XRP: The Fast and Borderless Currency Revolutionizing Global Payments XRP is a digital currency created to move money quickly and cheaply around the world. It runs on the XRP Ledger, a system that doesn't rely on banks or central authorities. This means transactions are fast, secure, and can't be reversed or faked. You don't need a bank account to use XRP, making it accessible to anyone, anywhere. The currency was developed by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, who launched it with 100 billion coins, giving 80 billion to Ripple to help grow the network. XRP aims to transform how we send money across borders. Its speed and low costs set it apart from other cryptocurrencies. Ripple uses XRP to increase liquidity and supports the ecosystem by releasing coins in a controlled way. In today's market, XRP looks promising as it bridges traditional finance and digital money, focusing on seamless transfers between different currencies. With the world moving towards digital payments, XRP's technology and approach could make it a strong contender in the cryptocurrency space. Conclusion While SOL and XRP remain strong assets, XYZVerse (XYZ) uniquely merges meme culture with sports in a community-driven platform, emerging as a notable opportunity for early adopters.

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Ticker BTC Price $103,500 (-0.4%) Market cap $2.02 Trillion Trading volume (24-hour) $44.62 Billion (-8.18%) Circulating supply 19.86 Million BTC All-time high $109,114; January 20, 2025 All-time low $0.04865; Jul 15, 2010 24-hour high $104,533 24-hour low $102,659 Bitcoin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $103,500 Price Prediction $113,223 (+9.87%) Fear & Greed Index 70 (Greed) Sentiment Bullish Price Volatility (30-day variation) 6.69% Green Days 18/30 (60%) 50-Day SMA $90,309 200-Day SMA $86,072 14-Day RSI 69.59 Bitcoin price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: BTC price analysis shows that Bitcoin faces rising bearish domination above $104K.

Currently, buyers are aiming for a continuation of the rally above immediate resistance lines. BTC price analysis 1-day chart: Bitcoin price faces bearish consolidation below $104K Analyzing the daily Bitcoin price chart, we see that BTC faced bearish domination around the $104K level, resulting in a bearish consolidation below $104K. Buyers are currently struggling to break above the consolidation. The 24-hour volume has declined to $1.51 billion, showing a drop in trading interest today. BTC is trading at $103,500, declining by over 0.4% in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin shows mixed volatility The RSI-14 trend line has dropped from its previous level but trades around the overbought region at 68, hinting that a bearish correction might be on the edge. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. BTC/USD 4-hour price chart: Bulls face minor resistance at $104K The 4-hour Bitcoin price chart suggests that bears are strengthening their position to hold the price below the $104K level. Currently, bears are aiming for a drop below EMA50 trend line. Bitcoin aims for immediate correction The BoP indicator trades in a bullish region at 0.27, showing that short-term buyers are taking a chance to accelerate an upward trend.

The hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin is attempting to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a recovery rally in the coming hours. If BTC’s price holds momentum above $105,869, it will fuel a bullish rally to $109,566. BTC/USDT Chart If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $100,693, beginning a bearish trend to $95,960. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin down today? Bears continue to defend the price chart around $104K, resulting a strong consolidation in the BTC price chart. As buyers struggle in gaining confidence, bears are preparing for further downtrend on the price chart. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price recently broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, forming a new ATH. The price currently aims to maintain its buying demand above $100K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. are set to expand the Trump family’s cryptocurrency business portfolio by investing in Bitcoin mining-focused Hut 8. Hut 8, based in Miami, announced the launch of its majority-owned subsidiary, American Bitcoin, dedicated to Bitcoin mining and strategic reserve development. Bitcoin price prediction May 2025 Bitcoin’s Q1 2025 performance was notably weak, with a 12.5% loss, as per CoinGlass data, marking the worst first quarter since 2018. In the last few weeks of April, the price of Bitcoin recovered smoothly and touched a high around $95K. Will Bitcoin continue its recovery rally in May? Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $91,000 and be pushed further, at least $108,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $85,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction May 2025 $85,000 $91,000 $108,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 $68,000 $120,000 $160,000 Bitcoin Price Predictions 2026-2031 Year Minimum Price Average Price Maximum Price 2026 $115,000 $130,000 $185,000 2027 $140,491 $170,100 $216,738 2028 $164,063 $185,068 $244,142 2029 $195,629 $200,312 $255,321 2030 $225,903 $248,568 $270,593 2031 $285,058 $303,555 $350,548 Bitcoin price prediction 2026 Bitcoin might witness slow growth after 2025’s halving surge, resulting in a surge in selling pressure. However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026. Bitcoin price prediction 2027 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491. The potential maximum price is estimated to be $216,738, with an average value of $170,100. Bitcoin price prediction 2028 By 2028, Bitcoin’s price is expected to reach a low of $164,063. Maximum price projections are as high as $244,142, averaging about $185,068 for the year. Bitcoin price forecast 2029 Projections for 2029 suggest that Bitcoin could be valued at a minimum of $195,629. The price may peak at as much as $255,321, with an average throughout the year expected to be around $200,312. Bitcoin (BTC) price prediction 2030 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $225,903 and potentially rise to a maximum of $270,593.

Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history | Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K.

The motion did not address Rule 60, which governs relief from final judgments, leading to its rejection . However, Morgan clarified that while the court denied the motion, it did so on procedural grounds, not substantive disagreement with the settlement. This denial means the parties cannot yet proceed with the expected next step: a motion to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals requesting a limited remand. A remand would allow Judge Torres to grant the specific relief agreed upon in the settlement, including dissolving the injunction and approving the reduced penalty of $50 million.

Meanwhile, Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, said both sides will revisit this issue with the Court. This suggests continued cooperation between Ripple and the SEC to finalize the agreed terms. Alderoty also clarified that the rejection did not impact Ripple’s victories and XRP’s status, but was merely due to a procedural error. Once a corrected motion is submitted and approved, the sequence of actions will resume. Upon receiving a favorable indicative ruling, the parties will again request a limited remand from the Court of Appeals. After the remand is granted, they can return to Judge Torres to formally seek dissolution of the injunction and entry of the reduced fine. Despite the procedural error, the overall structure of the settlement remains intact. The initial agreement between Ripple and the SEC remains signed and valid. The setback delays the timeline but does not reverse the progress made. If the court ultimately grants the necessary relief, the final step will involve a joint motion to dismiss both the appeal and cross-appeal at the Second Circuit level.

Since the start of 2025, XRP has gained 14.2% and now holds a market cap of $139.06 billion, ranking as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency. Reaching the $20 mark would require a 743.88% surge from its current level. According to analyst Stock Moe , this is a crucial support level. If the price fails to hold here, he warns it could slide to $0.226, then $0.213, and even $0.202 in a continued downtrend. Despite the current weakness, Moe says the bigger picture for XRP remains bullish. XRP Price Predicition The $300 Price Target Explained Stock Moe believes XRP still has the potential to hit $300. He admits this sounds wild and calls it a moment of “opium,” but points to billion-dollar investors who continue to bet on XRP. He says these big players are not worried by short-term noise because they understand the long-term utility of XRP. Moe explains that the delay in XRP’s breakout is not a failure, just a test of patience. Moe notes XRP has broken below the Bollinger Bands for three straight days. This usually signals a test of the 13 or 50-day EMAs. If XRP drops below $0.213, it could move to $0.202 or $0.172. However, Moe dismisses extreme bearish calls for $0.160, saying the charts do not support such a move. He sees the current action as a response to uncertainty, not a collapse. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Is BlackRock XRP ETF Coming Soon? Here’s the Truth Behind the $9 Trillion Rumors , SEC Delay Adds Pressure The market reacted negatively to the delayed SEC response , causing panic selling. Moe says this fear is emotional and not based on fundamentals. He believes short-term holders are giving up, while long-term investors will benefit from staying calm. Institutional Moves Back the Vision Moe is confident in XRP’s future and is backing his belief by partnering with Gemini . He is offering users $25 in XRP for trading $100, showing his continued support. He says the $300 goal is not hype but a reflection of where XRP could go if real use cases take off. Moe ends by saying XRP’s rally is just slow, not dead, and those who wait may be the ones who win big. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

According to the official report, the man, who previously pleaded guilty, received his sentence on Friday. According to the report, the perpetrator, Eric Council Jr. of Athens, Alabama, was indicted for his role in hacking the X handle belonging to the securities agency. After the hack, he falsely announced the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in an attempt to drive up the value of Bitcoin. Authorities mentioned that Council conspired to commit aggravated identity theft for his role in the SIM swap attack. SEC X account hacker sentenced to 14 months in prison According to the authorities, 26-year-old Council conspired with others to carry out the act, taking control of the X account to make the announcement. At the time, the decision was highly anticipated by all interested parties in the crypto industry, with the false announcement causing the price of the digital asset to increase by $1,000. The surge was also followed by a correction, which saw the price of the asset drop by $2,000 per BTC. The conspirators gained access to the SEC’s X account using an unauthorized Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) swap that was done by Council. A SIM swap is a form of fraud where a criminal actor illegally induces a cellular phone carrier to reassign a cellular phone number from a victim’s SIM to a SIM card controlled by the criminal actor. This way, the criminal can access several accounts belonging to the victim, including social media, in the case of Council, and digital asset accounts. As part of the scheme, Council used an identity card printer to create an illegal identification card using the victim’s personal identifiable information obtained from co-conspirators. Council then used the identity card to impersonate the victims and gain access to their numbers for the purpose of accessing the SEC’s X account. His co-conspirators then went ahead to post the name of the SEC chairman, falsely announcing the approval of the Bitcoin ETF. The authorities were able to establish that Council was paid in Bitcoin for his role in the hack. Authorities kick against Council’s activities According to reports, the FBI found a laptop in a residence that Council lived in after a search warrant was obtained. On the laptop, the authorities found search phrases like, “How can I know for sure if I am being investigated by the FBI?” and “What are some signs that the FBI is after you?” The FBI eventually arrested him in late 2024. The SEC announced the official approval of the Bitcoin product on January 10, a day after the incident. The price of the asset has doubled since then, with BTC now trading well into the $100,000 price mark. In addition to his prison term, Council has been ordered to forfeit $50,000 and will be supervised for three years after his release, with the condition that he may not commit identity fraud or access the dark web. “Schemes of this nature threaten the health and integrity of our market system,” said U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro, in a statement. “SIM swap schemes threaten the financial security of average citizens, financial institutions, and government agencies. Don’t fool yourself into thinking you can’t be caught. You will be caught, prosecuted, and will pay the price for the damage your actions create.” The Securities and Exchange Commission Office of Inspector General Special Agent in Charge Amanda James mentioned that the sentencing shows that the agency is committed to putting bad actors away and holding them accountable for their actions while maintaining the integrity of SEC operations through investigative oversight. “We are committed to working with the SEC and other law enforcement partners to help the SEC effectively and efficiently deliver on its critical mission.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Returns clocked in at nearly 40% over the past year. That makes it the top performer compared with gold, stocks and bonds. It’s a sign that more people in Moscow are warming up to cryptocurrencies for their daily money moves. Related Reading: Analysis: Crypto Heats Up As $35 Billion Enters Market In Under A Month Bitcoin Leads 2025 Rally According to the Central Bank of Russia, Bitcoin’s cumulative return since 2022 has reached 121%. That towers over any gains seen in gold or corporate bonds during the same period. While gold managed only single‑digit increases, Bitcoin has nearly doubled its value in three years. That jump has grabbed the attention of investors who are used to slower returns from banks or stock funds. Source: Russian Central Bank report. Sharp Swings Test Investors Based on reports from the central bank, Bitcoin’s price swung wildly in early 2025. The first four months brought nearly 20% drop. Many traders faced nerve‑racking weeks as prices slid. But April saw a strong comeback. Bitcoin climbed more than 10% that month, easing worries among those who watched its dip. Those fast moves highlight just how far digital coins can swing in a short time. ETFs And Adoption Drive Growth The rise of spot Bitcoin exchange‑traded funds has made it easier for bigger investors to get in. In places like the United States and Hong Kong, new ETFs let people buy Bitcoin through their regular brokerage accounts. That convenience has helped push demand higher. More folks don’t have to wrestle with crypto wallets or complex trading platforms anymore. They can tap Bitcoin through tools they already use for stocks and bonds. Local And Global Factors Matter Global uncertainty has driven some of this interest. Big swings in currency values and low yields on bank deposits have left people hunting for better returns. In Russia, a weaker ruble has nudged locals toward assets like Bitcoin that are priced in dollars. At the same time, countries such as Kyrgyzstan and Ukraine are exploring crypto in their budgets. Even firms like Cantor Fitzgerald are looking at Bitcoin as a way to shield against market swings.

A 38% gain over a year can’t be matched by most safe havens. Yet anyone tracking the 19% fall in early 2025 knows it isn’t for the faint of heart. Digital coins can zoom higher one month and skid lower the next. That volatility is why many experts still advise limiting how much of your portfolio is in crypto.

Broader market growth continued, with the total crypto market cap rising 2.4% to $3.42 trillion by Friday. Sentiment cooled only slightly, as the Crypto Fear and Greed Index dipped two points but remained firmly in greed territory at 71. Most leading altcoins ended in the green, with only a few registering modest single-digit losses over the seven-day period. What happened with Bitcoin this week? Much of this week’s price action was dictated by shifting macroeconomic conditions, with early gains fuelled by improving geopolitical sentiment. On Monday, May 12, Bitcoin surged to an intraday high of $105,525 after the United States and China signed a tariff de-escalation agreement in Geneva. The deal, which took effect on May 14, saw both countries lower their respective reciprocal tariffs to 10% for a 90-day period, down from the previous rates of 145% and 125%. The easing of trade tensions helped revive risk appetite across financial markets, lifting cryptocurrencies alongside equities. The rally gained further traction on Tuesday following the release of April’s US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data. Inflation cooled to 2.3% year-over-year, while monthly gains held at 0.2%, both in line with expectations. The softer print helped calm fears of extended monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve, giving risk assets another leg up. However, bullish momentum faded by Thursday after the US Producer Price Index (PPI) showed an unexpected 0.5% monthly decline in April, defying economists’ forecasts of a 0.2% increase. The drop, driven entirely by a 0.7% slide in services, marked the sharpest contraction since the series began in 2009. Bitcoin pulled back to around $102,655 following the report, paring earlier gains. Markets turned cautious ahead of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s remarks later that day. While Powell reaffirmed the central bank’s commitment to its 2% inflation target, he suggested the Fed may revise its consensus statement in the coming months to reflect economic uncertainty and evolving policy outlooks better. By Friday, Bitcoin remained above $102,000 but showed signs of stalling, as traders weighed the mixed signals from inflation data and policy commentary. Will Bitcoin go up? According to market watchers, Bitcoin’s ability to hold above $100,000 has reinforced its near-term support, but the lack of a decisive breakout has kept traders on edge. Onchain analytics firm Swissblock noted in a May 16 post that Bitcoin is currently “stuck in a narrowing $101.5K–$104K range” following two failed attempts to break higher. Without a strong move before the weekend, a decisive resolution is likely to be delayed into next week, it added. Others echoed a similar sentiment. Market intelligence provider Santiment observed a shift in trader psychology, noting a slight rise in bearish expectations following repeated rejections at $105,000. However, the firm pointed out that rising fear and impatience among retail participants have historically been a contrarian bullish signal. Technical analysts are also closely watching activity on major exchanges. According to Material Indicators, large blocks of ask liquidity have clustered between $105,000 and $110,000 on Binance, effectively capping Bitcoin’s upside in the absence of a strong catalyst. See below.

However, they warned traders to stay cautious, flagging the $98,000–$100,000 range as a critical zone to monitor for potential downside tests, while cautioning against short squeezes and bull traps that could emerge in the current low-liquidity environment. In the event of a pullback from current levels, independent trader Daan Crypto Trades pointed to $93,000 as a key level to watch, noting that Bitcoin is currently trading far from major liquidity clusters.

Others like pseudonymous analyst Sudelytic noted that despite the recent pullback, long-term holders remain unmoved, with on-chain data showing a decline in the Long-Term Holder SOPR, indicating that most selling pressure is coming from short-term traders. Bitcoin SOPR. Source: Sudelytic . “This might just be a breather before the next leg up, Worth keeping an eye on,” the analyst added. The broader setup points to a market holding firm but waiting for direction. Without a fresh catalyst, price action may stay rangebound as traders gauge whether recent support levels can withstand growing short-term pressure. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $103,993, roughly 4% below its all-time high. A break above this level could serve as a short-term bullish catalyst if buyers manage to push the price into price discovery. Altcoins see modest gains Even with modest gains across the board, altcoins remain out of favour. The altcoin season index dropped 8 points to 25, well below the threshold for an alt season. The top performers this week, as of May 16, were: dogwifhat dogwifhat (WIF) has soared 53% over the past week, now trading around $1.11 with a market cap topping $1.1 billion. Source: CoinMarketCap One of the key reasons behind this surge seems to be renewed hype from the community, especially after news broke that Coinbase is being added to the S&P 500. That move was seen as bullish for WIF since it’s part of Coinbase’s COIN50 Index, a collection of the top 50 digital assets listed on the platform. There’s also been a clear uptick in futures market activity. According to CoinGlass, open interest in WIF futures has climbed to $450 million, up from just $175 million at the start of April. On the daily chart, WIF looks like it’s been forming a round bottom pattern since early December, a bullish setup that usually points to steady gains ahead, at least going by technical analysis. On top of that, the weighted funding rate has stayed positive for the last 8 days, a sign of strong bullish sentiment in the market. Pi Over the past week, Pi (PI) gained 24.5%, trading at $0.91 at the time of writing. Its market cap stood at $5.92 billion, while daily trading volume hovered around $422 million. Source: CoinMarketCap The rally was mainly driven by community excitement after the Pi Foundation teased a “major announcement” set for May 14. That teaser sparked a massive pump, with PI jumping over 200% to hit an intraday high of $1.60 on May 12, its highest price since March 2025. But when the big reveal finally happened, which was a $100 million Pi Network venture fund to support ecosystem projects, the market wasn’t impressed. PI quickly gave up most of its gains, dropping over 50% almost right after the news came out. There are a couple of reasons for the sharp dip. First, the venture fund is more of a long-term play and doesn’t bring any instant benefits or price support for the token. Second, the hype around the announcement likely led to unrealistic expectations. This kind of price action is a textbook example of the “buy the rumor, sell the news” pattern, where investors push the price up in anticipation of big news, only to dump it once the actual announcement falls short of the hype. Kaspa Kaspa (KAS) held on to 18% gains over the past 7 days, trading at $0.1211 when writing. Its market cap stands at over $3.17 billion. Source: CoinMarketCap While no clear catalyst was identified at press time, the rally appeared to gain momentum after bulls successfully flipped the $0.12 resistance zone into support. Renewed interest may also be tied to Kaspa’s recent “Crescendo” mainnet upgrade, which went live on May 5. The update improved scalability and efficiency by increasing block production speed tenfold and shifting the network to a Rust-based architecture.

In both cases, rapid price crashes revealed hidden actors, questionable token unlocks, and alleged side agreements that blinded market participants, with OM falling more than 90% within hours late April on no apparent catalyst. Unlike traditional finance, where market makers provide orderly bid-ask spreads on regulated venues, crypto market makers often operate more like high-stakes trading desks. They're not just quoting prices; they’re negotiating pre-launch token allocations, accepting lockups, structuring liquidity for centralized exchanges, and sometimes taking equity or advisory stakes. The result is a murky space where liquidity provision is entangled with private deals, tokenomics, and often, insider politics. A CoinDesk exposé in late April showed how some Movement Labs executives colluded with their own market maker to dump $38 million worth of MOVE in the open market. Now, some firms are questioning whether they’ve been too casual in trusting counterparties. How do you hedge a position when token unlock schedules are opaque? What happens when handshake deals quietly override DAO proposals? “Our approach now includes more extensive preliminary discussions and educational sessions with project teams to ensure they thoroughly understand market-making mechanics,” Hong Kong-based Metalpha’s market-making division told CoinDesk in an interview. “Our deal structures have evolved to emphasize long-term strategic alignment over short-term performance metrics, incorporating specific safeguards against unethical behavior such as excessive token dumping and artificial trading volume,"" it said. Behind the scenes, conversations are intensifying. Deal terms are being scrutinized more carefully. Some liquidity desks are reevaluating how they underwrite token risk. Others are demanding stricter transparency — or walking away from murky projects altogether. “Projects no longer accept prestigious reputations at face value, having witnessed how even established players can exploit shadow allocations or engage in detrimental token selling practices,” Metalpha’s head of Web3 ecosystem Max Sun noted. “The era of presumptive trust has concluded,” he claimed. Beneath the polished surface of token launch announcements and market-making agreements lies another layer of crypto finance — the secondary OTC market, where locked tokens quietly change hands well before vesting cliffs hit the public eye. These under-the-table deals, often struck between early backers, funds, and syndicates, are now distorting supply dynamics and skewing price discovery, some traders say. And for market makers tasked with providing orderly liquidity, they’re becoming an increasingly opaque and dangerous variable. “The secondary OTC market has changed the dynamics of the industry,” said Min Jung, analyst at Presto Research, which runs a market-making unit. “If you look at tokens with suspicious price action — like $LAYER, $OM, $MOVE, and others — they’re often the ones most actively traded on the secondary OTC market.” “The entire supply and vesting schedule has become distorted because of these off-market deals, and for liquid funds, the real challenge is figuring out when supply is actually unlocking,” Jung added. In a market where price is fiction and supply is negotiated in back rooms, the real risk isn’t volatility for traders — it is believing the float is what the whitepaper and founders say it is.

Novogratz, one of the pioneers of cryptocurrency markets, stated that gold is a $22 trillion asset class, reminding that Bitcoin currently has a size of only $2 trillion. “It's a matter of time before Bitcoin makes its next move towards $130,000 to $150,000. At that point, we enter a period of price discovery,” said Novogratz, arguing that Bitcoin has a valuation potential that could approach gold in the long term. Related News: BREAKING: Elon Musk Changes His X (Twitter) Username - This Altcoin Rises 119% Stating that Galaxy Digital initially set out with the goal of becoming the “Goldman Sachs of crypto,” Novogratz stated that the company now has two main areas of activity: crypto services and artificial intelligence data centers. Stating that they are an important company in the AI infrastructure field with their large-scale data center called Helios in Texas, Novogratz announced that they have signed agreements with CoreWeave in this field that will last 15 years and reach approximately $14 billion in rental income. Novogratz, who also evaluated the political approach to crypto in the US, said that the Trump administration was positive towards crypto, whereas the Biden era was “torture in terms of crypto.” Arguing that crypto laws should progress with bipartisan support, Novogratz stated that the Trump family’s interest in crypto was remarkable, but that this interest should not pose an obstacle unless it has an illegal dimension. *This is not investment advice.

However, several altcoins have marked massive losses over the past day, led by another double-digit price plunge from PI. BTC Stays Calm Bitcoin started the business week on the right foot as its price shot up from under $104,000 to a multi-month peak of just shy of $106,000. This came as a direct consequence of the trade deal struck by the US and China. However, the asset couldn’t maintain its run and dropped by roughly five grand in the following hours to a weekly low of under $101,000. Nevertheless, the bulls didn’t allow a breakdown beneath $100,000, and the cryptocurrency began its recovery that pushed it to $105,000 by Thursday. Another rejection followed , and more volatility ensued on Friday, but overall, bitcoin has been able to remain in a relatively tight range between $102,500 and $104,000. The past 24 hours brought some more minor fluctuations around these levels, and BTC now stands close to the upper boundary.

Starting in 2026 , crypto service providers must collect and report user data under the OECD’s Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) — a global initiative aimed at boosting tax transparency and curbing evasion. This move places the UK in sync with over 40 countries, including all EU member states , and has massive implications for both centralized and decentralized crypto platforms. What Are CARF Rules and Why Is the UK Adopting Them? The Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) was developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) — an international body of 38 member countries — to tackle tax evasion in the digital asset space . By adopting CARF, the UK aims to: Enhance transparency in crypto transactions Align with international tax standards Prevent offshore tax avoidance using digital assets Key Dates You Must Know 2026 : UK-based and foreign crypto service providers (CASPs) must start collecting user identity and transaction data . May 31, 2027 : First deadline for annual reporting . Even if you’re not based in the UK, if you serve UK users, you must comply. Which Users Are Affected? CASPs must report: All UK tax residents Users from countries implementing CARF rules (over 40 jurisdictions expected) They must collect data from all users , but reporting is limited to those residing in CARF-compliant countries. EU’s DAC8 rules will work in tandem with CARF, requiring EU-focused crypto firms to also follow strict transparency measures. What Data Must Be Collected? Crypto firms will be required to gather: User identity details Transaction data (including volumes, timestamps, and counterparties) This applies to: Exchanges Custodial wallets Transfer service providers What Happens If CASPs Don’t Comply? Non-compliance with CARF can result in: Fines of up to €300 per user Penalties for late , inaccurate , or missing filings CASPs are strongly advised to start building reporting infrastructure now to avoid future penalties. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitstamp Secures CASP License Under MiCA to Expand in Europe , Impact on Decentralized and Non-Custodial Platforms The new rules are expected to challenge the business models of: Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) Non-custodial wallets These platforms emphasize user privacy and flexibility , which may not align with CARF requirements. The industry is watching closely for additional UK government guidance . There are already rumors of some firms considering an exit from the UK due to the high cost of compliance . Final Thoughts The UK’s adoption of CARF signals a new era of regulation in the crypto space. While the goal is more security and transparency , it could come at the cost of privacy and decentralization — values many in the crypto community hold dear.Crypto businesses must now adapt, prepare, or relocate , as 2026 draws closer. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The analyst confirms that XRP has completed the first leg of a corrective pattern and is preparing for a potential upward movement. The chart marks the completion of this wave at $2.59 and identifies the corrective wave A as having finalized at around $2.36. Dark Defender noted that he had already predicted the $2.59 top and the $2.36 correction level, and has now outlined the asset’s next steps. Hi all XRP has finalised the first leg of correction in the 4-Hour Time Frame. We addressed $2.59 first wave together and addressed the $2.36 where it happpened with 100% accuracy. Now A wave has been completed and we can see a rise towards $2.55 levels. We are heading… pic.twitter.com/YsxgWI0ZO7 — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) May 16, 2025 XRP’s Recent Performance After a historic performance between November 2024 and January 2025, XRP spent the next few months consolidating, with much of that time spent close to the $2 level. However, the asset began climbing after Donald Trump announced a historic trade deal between the U.S. and the U.K. The chart showed XRP’s rise from around $2.1 to a multi-month peak of $2.65. However, the asset experienced a notable correction after the court denied the settlement motion in the SEC lawsuit due to procedural errors. This decline completed the A wave. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Expectations for Wave B and Wave C Following the completion of the A wave, the analyst expects XRP to rise toward the $2.55 level, forming wave B in an ABC corrective structure. After the anticipated retracement in wave C, the chart projects a strong upward leg targeting $3.3333 as wave 3. This longer-term projection implies a continued overall bullish trend once the corrective phase is complete. The analyst also highlighted important Fibonacci retracement levels, with the 61.80% level at $2.4189 and the 50.00% level at $2.3502. At the time of his analysis, the asset traded at $2.42, and these levels are near-term support levels, with the chart suggesting buying interest around the 50% Fibonacci level, which caused a brief rebound. What’s Next for XRP? In his post, Dark Defender identifies key support levels at $2.3502 and $2.2222, while resistance is expected at $2.58 and ultimately at $3.3333 in the short term. These values outline the potential trading range for XRP as the corrective wave plays out. Other analysts have shared bullish expectations for XRP, and the chart depicts a potential impulse wave forming once the correction concludes, aligning with the bullish outlook presented.

Senator Blumenthal, who represents Connecticut, said the company gave a “seriously inadequate” response as investigation into its business continues. According to reports, WLF sent a letter to him this week in response to a notice that the company is under investigation. The Senator mentioned that the inadequate response shows that the company is avoiding the fact that foreign governments and others can enrich themselves and compromise United States President Donald Trump through his affiliation with World Liberty Finance. He added that the company’s refusal to answer questions regarding the exposure of the president to financial entanglements raises serious questions. Senator Blumenthal slams WLF over “inadequate” response World Liberty Finance is a decentralized financial platform led by Zak Folkman, Chase Herro, the Trump Family, and the Witkoff family, who have close ties to the Trumps. The platform allows users to trade, lend, and borrow digital assets without intervention from third-party intermediaries such as banks. The project was launched in September, in the lead up to the United States presidential election, raising about $550 million in a token sale. In addition, the platform also issued its stablecoin in March. Earlier this month, Senator Blumenthal, who is a permanent ranking member on the Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations sent a letter for the decentralized firm’s leadership, informing them of a potential investigation over violation of government ethics requirements and other laws, including the foreign emoluments clause of the US constitution. This particular clause was created to prohibit federal officials from accepting salaries, fees, or profits from foreign governments without the consent of Congress. The inquiry was opened days after World Liberty Finance, which is partly owned by the US President and his sons, announced a $2 billion deal with the UAE government and facilitated by World Liberty Finance’s new stablecoin USD1. Before then, the platform had also agreed to advise the Pakistani government on issues related to cryptocurrencies. “Historic day for @worldlibertyfi at our MOU signing ceremony in Pakistan today. We are looking forward to bringing diversity and financial inclusion to the next generation in Pakistan and beyond,” Zach Witkoff said on X in reaction to the update. Blumenthal sounds alarm over national security risks According to Blumenthal, businesses like those carried out by World Liberty Finance pose unprecedented conflicts of interest and national security. He also asked the company to submit key details to the Senate’s Investigations Subcommittee, including details regarding President Trump’s involvement in the firm’s operations. However, the Thursday response by WLF’s attorneys made the Senator furious, with the attorneys dismissing his queries which they claimed contained inaccuracies and fundamentally flawed inferences. In addition, he mentioned that he will continue to demand transparency for the American people. “The Company has exercised rigorous diligence to ensure compliance with applicable legal and regulatory obligations at every stage,” World Liberty’s attorney, Teresa Goody Guillén, said. While the letter discussed the importance of World Liberty Finance’s mission of democratizing access to the financial system, it refused to address questions regarding the stake of President Trump in the company or a potential conflict of interest posed by its dealings with foreign governments. It also did not provide a direct response to any information that Blumenthal requested about the firm’s operations. Inquiries into the Trump family’s crypto dealings are now on the rise across Capitol Hill, as Democrats are seizing the narrative. On Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent received a letter from House Democrats, which demanded access to any suspicious activity reports (SARs) his department may have filed in recent months regarding the president’s numerous crypto dealings. The letter was written by ranking members Representatives Gerald Connolly, Joseph Morelle, and Jamie Rakin, requesting information to investigate potential election fraud, corruption, and foreign influence.

But for retail investors, the value proposition has become harder to define. With no native staking, limited DeFi integration, and a token model tied to Ripple’s legal and corporate decisions, XRP holders are left relying on price appreciation alone. Now, a new project is drawing analyst comparisons to Bitcoin’s early phase — and unlike XRP, it delivers real-time, protocol-level income from day one. Bitcoin Solaris, a dual-layer blockchain with integrated mobile mining, allows users to earn BTC-S tokens directly from their smartphones. Some market observers see echoes of Bitcoin’s earliest years — when the price was negligible, mining was accessible, and returns for early participants reached 13,000,000% over time. A Practical Way to Earn Daily Crypto Rewards With the Nova App, Bitcoin Solaris enables anyone with a smartphone to earn BTC-S through passive mining. Users allocate 1–5 GB of storage and background CPU, and the app runs silently in the background — often during charging or idle periods. Unlike traditional mining, there’s no expensive hardware or energy-intensive setup. For XRP holders, this presents a functional contrast. Instead of waiting for market cycles or regulatory clarity, they can participate in a working network that pays out daily based on contribution, not speculation. There are no staking lockups, no validator systems to understand, and no intermediaries involved. Just tap, mine, and earn. Infrastructure That Supports Daily Income at Scale Bitcoin Solaris is built to scale while maintaining decentralization and speed. It operates on a dual-layer blockchain: The Base Layer uses Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-Capacity (PoC) for energy-efficient ledger validation. The Solaris Layer uses Proof-of-History (PoH) and Proof-of-Time (PoT) to process mobile mining and smart contract activity at 10,000+ TPS, with 2-second finality. This layered approach ensures that mining rewards are issued quickly, securely, and sustainably. While XRP transactions are fast, the network does not support user-driven consensus or real-time earnings. Bitcoin Solaris puts reward mechanisms into the hands of actual participants. In a detailed review, HotCuppaCrypto explored how Bitcoin Solaris reflects the early structure of Bitcoin—with fixed supply, open mining, and first-mover reward dynamics. The video outlines how BTC-S may offer a rare second chance for investors who missed BTC’s earliest days. Presale Phase 3 Closing Soon Bitcoin Solaris is currently in Presale Phase 3, with BTC-S tokens priced at 3 USDT. This phase will close soon, after which the price will increase to 4 USDT. Of the 21 million fixed supply, 4.2 million BTC-S (20%) are allocated for presale participants. Unlike inflationary ecosystems, there will be no additional token minting beyond what the protocol allows through mining and validator operations. Early buyers gain not only discounted access, but also priority entry into Nova App mining before difficulty rates increase and centralized exchange listings begin. The setup mirrors Bitcoin’s early incentive structure — when tokens were cheap, access was open, and rewards were protocol-native. Audited and Verified Bitcoin Solaris has completed full third-party audits and verification processes to ensure network integrity and user trust. All earnings are issued securely, based on real participation, not administrative discretion. Cyberscope Audit : Reviewed smart contracts, mining logic, and emission rules Freshcoins Audit : Assessed performance, scalability, and device compatibility KYC Verification : Confirmed project governance and operational transparency XRP may serve institutions — but Bitcoin Solaris is rewarding individuals. Through mobile mining, daily BTC-S income, and limited presale access at 3 USDT, it reintroduces a rare dynamic: a blockchain where users earn because they contribute. The early-stage opportunity is real, and this time, it fits in your pocket.

Meanwhile, MAGACOINFINANCE is quietly establishing itself as an early-stage opportunity that’s starting to draw meaningful attention. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Solana and SEI Make Headlines with Ecosystem Developments Solana continues to impress analysts with its sustained DeFi growth. Fragmetric, a Solana-based protocol, has surpassed $200 million in total value locked (TVL), underscoring the strength of the ecosystem. Although recent exploits at Loopscale—another Solana-based lending platform—led to losses exceeding 5.7 million USDC and 1,200 SOL , recovery efforts and improved network security have helped maintain investor confidence. SEI Network is also undergoing key infrastructure changes. Developers are considering transitioning to a pure EVM-compatible model , aimed at streamlining developer experience and expanding its user base. This comes alongside a strong market push—SEI recently jumped 7.2% in 24 hours , breaking above resistance at $0.275 . Analysts now view SEI as one of the most promising Layer 1 chains for agile deployment in 2025. XRP Rebounds with ETF Tailwinds and Whale Accumulation XRP is trading around $2.39 , up 8.5% in the past 24 hours , as it regains traction amid favorable regulatory headlines. Whale activity has surged, with nearly $2 billion worth of XRP accumulated in the past month. Technically, XRP has reclaimed its 100-hour simple moving average, with strong support at $2.30 .

Just three years ago, spot Bitcoin ETFs were hailed as crypto’s final gateway into mainstream finance. And for a brief moment, they looked like they would truly revolutionise investing. After a flurry of approvals and billions of institutional dollars flowing in, many on Wall Street assumed the ETF era was upon us. You might also like: Tokenization beyond finance: Real-world assets will be crypto’s next engine | Opinion ETFs gave institutions a straightforward method of gaining exposure to Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) without grappling with private keys and custody complications. But they have a fundamental limitation in that they typically track price alone. When crypto’s famously volatile market moves sideways, ETF returns can stall as well. That makes spot ETFs appear increasingly like blunt instruments in a market that demands innovation and sophistication. Rising expectations in a 24/7 market The reality is that as institutional adoption grows, so too do expectations. In capital markets, an investment that cannot generate returns beyond price appreciation has an inherent flaw. That flaw is magnified in the fast-changing 24/7 world of crypto. Investors who were once content with passive exposure are demanding more. In traditional markets, exchange-traded products can be used to access dividends, interest-bearing instruments, or structured investment vehicles. Why should crypto investment be limited to simple price speculation? Exchange-traded notes answer this demand by offering structured exposure to multiple crypto assets, including staking-based tokens, DeFi portfolios, and multi-asset investment baskets. These products are flourishing in Europe, where offerings have rapidly expanded beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum to include products tracking staking rewards, diversified crypto portfolios, and structured derivatives. The role of regulation: MiCA changes the game Momentum in Europe isn’t accidental—the continent’s UCITS regulation strongly limits ETF activities, creating a natural opening for ETCs and ETNs to lead the way as more adaptable investment vehicles—a factor being accelerated by the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), which came into full force at the end of last year. MiCA provides a unified legal framework for crypto assets across EU member states, mandating clearer standards for the issuance, operation, and marketing of digital assets. Crucially, MiCA addresses the primary concern about ETNs: credit risk. As debt securities, ETNs traditionally hinged on the issuer’s creditworthiness. Under MiCA, however, issuers must satisfy higher capital requirements and demonstrate operational transparency, reassuring protections for institutional money. This evolution reduces counterparty risk, mirroring regulatory frameworks already familiar to bond investors. Combined with the latest ETP performance data, the conclusion is difficult to miss: a growing number of institutional players appear comfortable embracing yield-bearing ETN structures in a well-regulated environment. A tale of two continents But while Europe strides ahead with MiCA, the United States remains hesitant. The SEC’s cautious approach has limited the availability of more versatile crypto investment products like ETNs. This regulatory lag puts U.S. investors at a disadvantage, restricting their ability to fully capitalize on the opportunities within the crypto market. Such divergence could be the beginning of a structural shift, where investors are no longer solely seeking exposure to Bitcoin’s next peak. These investors want vehicles that capture staking rewards or earn fees from decentralised finance protocols. A static ETF simply cannot offer these perks, giving a strong advantage to ETNs with their built-in potential for extra returns. That does not mean ETFs will vanish. They retain considerable brand power, particularly in North America, where name recognition and a simpler regulatory environment have made them top-of-mind for conservative players. Yet as conventional markets continue to hunger for yield, institutional capital is gradually shifting toward more dynamic structures—momentum which only stands to accelerate if the Trump regime chooses to ease restrictions or if Europe’s support for ETNs grows more comprehensive under MiCA. Criticism persists, but so does demand Critics who remain tethered to the safety of ETFs argue that staking tokens and newer DeFi assets are too risky or illiquid. They point to credit risk and smart contract exploits in decentralized platforms. Such skepticism can be healthy, but it fails to account for the real appetite among yield-seeking investors. The accelerating flows into ETNs suggest many are prepared to navigate these complexities in pursuit of stable returns, especially if the alternative is sitting idle through cyclical crypto doldrums. To an extent, ETFs were instrumental in legitimizing crypto among pension funds and large asset managers. Yet that very success opened the door to other structures that could build on rather than track crypto’s underlying innovation. In doing so, ETNs are carving out a unique space—one that captures the dynamism of digital assets more effectively than the plain-vanilla ETF. In essence, the crypto market’s next growth phase hinges on products that deliver more than blind bets on price. Institutions want diversification and yield. Regulators want transparency. ETNs, though not without pitfalls, appear to strike a better balance between these demands. As Europe forges ahead with regulatory clarity and as yield-hungry capital circles the globe, ETNs look set to eclipse ETFs as the default instrument for serious crypto allocation. For those content with a passive approach, ETFs may continue to suffice. But for the world’s largest funds, complacency is seldom a strategy. With the promise of income in both bull and bear markets, ETNs beckon as the savvier bet to properly harness the potential of crypto. If the near future of digital finance is about innovative ways to generate returns, ETNs are no mere sideshow. And they could yet be the main event.

This seemingly outrageous claim recently gained traction thanks to an insightful and provocative thread by Pumpius, a well-known influencer on X. According to Pumpius, the potential of XRP to become the bedrock of a fully tokenized global economy is not just theoretical—it is already unfolding. Ripple’s Silent Revolution: Tokenizing the World While many in the crypto space chase short-term hype, Ripple has been quietly laying the groundwork for what could be the most transformative financial infrastructure project in modern history. According to Pumpius, Ripple has been systematically working with governments, financial institutions, and asset firms across the globe to bring real-world assets (RWAs) on-chain. This strategic approach could fundamentally alter how value is transferred, owned, and stored. Tokenize the World: Why 1 XRP Could Be Worth $1,000,000 Sounds insane, right? Now read that again. What if every asset you’ve ever known — stocks, homes, currencies, oil, bonds, even carbon — was tokenized onto one blockchain? And what if XRP became the bridge for it all? This… pic.twitter.com/h6BbIcKKhw — Pumpius (@pumpius) May 16, 2025 One of the most significant strides made by Ripple is in real estate tokenization. In collaboration with the Colombian government, Ripple launched a pilot project to tokenize real estate assets, using its blockchain technology to streamline and secure property ownership. Additionally, Ripple’s XLS-20 and XLS-30 standards have facilitated the issuance of tokens and NFTs, proving the XRP Ledger’s flexibility and robustness. Ripple’s ambitions go beyond real estate. The company has pledged $100 million to tokenize carbon markets and is working with licensed asset firms like Archax and OpenEden to bring financial instruments on-chain. Through these partnerships and initiatives, Ripple aims to become the backbone of a multi-trillion-dollar tokenized economy. The Tokenized Economy: A Multi-Trillion Dollar Opportunity The concept of tokenizing real-world assets is not just speculative. According to reports by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and Citi, tokenized RWAs could exceed $16 trillion by 2030, and that figure is conservative. As real estate, stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities, and carbon credits increasingly move onto blockchains, the total value of tokenized assets could surpass $1 quadrillion. The challenge then becomes one of liquidity. If XRP, with its robust cross-asset transfer capabilities, becomes the bridge for this vast economic ecosystem , its value proposition changes drastically. XRP would not just be a cryptocurrency; it would be the liquidity spine of a global, tokenized economy. XRP: Built to Move Value, Not Store It A critical misconception about XRP is that it is designed to be a store of value. On the contrary, XRP’s true utility lies in its ability to move value efficiently and securely. With three to five seconds of settlement speeds, native multi-asset support, and compliance-ready architecture, XRP is engineered for global liquidity. Additionally, the XRP Ledger’s built-in automated market maker (AMM) and decentralized exchange (DEX) protocols make it uniquely suited to handle a wide range of assets. At the same time, its sidechains and hooks enable programmable finance. This infrastructure positions XRP as a potential universal bridge asset, facilitating transactions between tokenized stocks, real estate, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and more.

The total supply of XRP is capped at 100 billion tokens, with a significant portion already lost or held indefinitely. If XRP becomes the backbone of global tokenized settlements, its scarcity, combined with its utility, could lead to an astronomical valuation. Pumpius aptly points out that similar skepticism surrounded the early days of the internet. Back in 1994, few could imagine a world where the internet would underpin virtually every aspect of life. Yet, today, it is the fundamental fabric of global communication and commerce. XRP’s journey from a controversial crypto to the liquidity engine of a tokenized world could follow a similar trajectory. Looking Beyond the Hype: An Infrastructure Play Unlike speculative cryptocurrencies that thrive on hype cycles, Ripple’s approach is pragmatic and infrastructure-driven. Ripple is not building a token for short-term trading; it is building a financial system where XRP plays a crucial role as the base layer of liquidity. As tokenization of assets becomes mainstream, the need for a fast, scalable, and interoperable bridge asset becomes undeniable. Pumpius concludes by cautioning against dismissing XRP’s potential simply because it challenges the status quo. He argues that the real story is not about chart patterns or daily price fluctuations, but about the strategic alignment of Ripple’s ecosystem with the evolving financial landscape. Ripple’s silent, steady work to tokenize the world could ultimately turn the seemingly impossible into reality. XRP at $1,000,000 may sound like a far-fetched dream, but if Ripple’s vision of a tokenized world materializes, that valuation may become a mathematical inevitability. As the world moves towards digitizing assets and leveraging blockchain for financial infrastructure, XRP’s unique capabilities position it as more than just a cryptocurrency—it could become the liquidity spine of a transformed global economy.

Though no formal details were released, the timing of the post comes just ahead of Mizrachi’s scheduled appearance at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. Panama City to Accept Bitcoin and Major Stablecoins Mizrachi has previously stated that Panama City would accept Bitcoin, Ether, Tether, and USDC once crypto-to-fiat payment infrastructure is in place. However, a move to establish a formal reserve would require legislative backing from Panama’s National Assembly — a step he has not yet taken publicly. His post follows similar developments in Arizona and New Hampshire, where state lawmakers passed bills supporting Bitcoin reserves. Meanwhile, Ukraine is reportedly exploring Bitcoin as part of its national reserves strategy . During their meeting, Keiser indicated that discussions included Bitcoin mining and financial education. Let’s see how high it goes. — The ₿itcoin Libertarian (@TheBitcoin__) May 16, 2025 He pointed out Panama’s hydroelectric resources and El Salvador’s geothermal energy as tools to drive Bitcoin infrastructure across Central America. Herbert, who oversees El Salvador’s Bitcoin Office, revealed that Panama City plans to add the country’s “What is Money?” financial literacy textbook to its online library. The textbook forms part of El Salvador’s national curriculum on Bitcoin. Keiser currently serves as a senior advisor to El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele, while Herbert manages policy implementation. El Salvador holds over 6,100 Bitcoin, valued at nearly $640 million, as part of its official reserve, a model Panama City could be eyeing as it explores deeper Bitcoin integration. Public Companies Ramp Up Bitcoin Exposure Public companies continue to increase their exposure to Bitcoin, with Michael Saylor’s firm, Strategy, leading the charge. The Virginia-based company recently announced it would double its capital-raising efforts to $84 billion in order to acquire more Bitcoin. This includes plans to sell an additional $21 billion in common stock, following the full utilization of a prior program approved in October. In addition to equity sales, Strategy has also expanded its debt issuance target from $21 billion to $42 billion, with $14.6 billion still available under the current authorization. On Monday, Metaplanet also expanded its Bitcoin treasury, acquiring an additional 1,241 BTC for approximately 18.4 billion yen ($126 million). The latest purchase brings the company’s total Bitcoin holdings to 6,796 BTC, currently valued at over $706 million. This trend reflects a broader institutional interest in Bitcoin. During the first quarter of the year, publicly listed firms collectively grew their Bitcoin holdings by 16.1% , indicating continued confidence in the asset despite persistent market volatility.

The meeting, which also involved the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, comes at a time when over $193 billion in digital assets are staked across major proof-of-stake (PoS) networks. However, despite the massive scale of participation, staking remains in a legal gray zone in the US as regulators wrestle with its classification under existing securities law. The previous SEC administration also took enforcement actions against major players such as Kraken, Coinbase, and Consensys due to their staking services. The agency, under pro-crypto President Donald Trump, has recently dismissed these enforcement actions. During the meeting, Everstake told the SEC that non-custodial staking should not be classified as a securities transaction. The company said that users maintain full control over their digital assets throughout the staking process and do not transfer ownership to a third party. They argued that this makes staking a technical function, not an investment product. “Our main assertion is that staking is not a financial instrument or security transaction, but rather a technical process, a base-layer protocol mechanism—akin to an oracle in a database—that maintains the integrity and functionality of decentralized networks,” Everstake founder Sergii Vasylchuk told Cointelegraph. Everstake team meeting with the SEC. Source: Everstake Related: SEC delays staking decision for Grayscale ETH ETFs Everstake calls for regulatory clarity In a letter submitted to the SEC’s Crypto Task Force on April 8, 2025, Everstake asked the agency to extend regulatory clarity to non-custodial staking and custodial and liquid staking models. In the letter, which came in respond to Commissioner Hester Peirce’s call for input on regulatory treatment of blockchain services, Everstake argued that non-custodial staking should not be considered a securities offering. It claimed that non-custodial staking, where users retain control of their tokens, does not involve the pooling of assets or the expectation of profits from managerial efforts. In its model, Everstake said users delegate only validation rights while maintaining ownership of their digital assets. The staking rewards are algorithmically distributed by the blockchain network itself, and the firm merely provides technical infrastructure. Related: Ethereum ETF staking will have little impact without multimonth rally: Analyst Non-custodial staking fails the Howey test The letter also details why non-custodial staking fails each prong of the Howey test . Users do not make an investment of money in a common enterprise, do not expect profits from Everstake’s efforts, and are not dependent on the company’s management for financial returns. Instead, any rewards come from network-level incentives and fluctuate with the market value of the underlying asset. Everstake proposes specific criteria that should exempt non-custodial staking from securities classification. These include user asset control, absence of pooled funds, permissionless unstaking, and the provision of purely technical services. It likens non-custodial staking to proof-of-work mining, which the SEC has previously ruled out as a securities transaction. Margaret Rosenfeld, Everstake’s chief legal officer, also told Cointelegraph that “with non-custodial staking, there’s no handover of assets, no investment contract, and no third-party risk.” She added: “Treating it as a securities offering undermines the decentralized model and risks chilling innovation in the blockchain sector.” Nevertheless, the SEC has so far withheld a definitive stance. Rosenfeld said that the agency did not make any “specific commitments” on staking guidance. However, it continues to listen to industry stakeholders. “The Task Force is actively engaging with a range of stakeholders—including those involved with non-custodial staking, ETFs, and broader blockchain infrastructure—to gather input.” In an April 30 letter to the SEC, nearly 30 crypto advocate groups led by the lobby group the Crypto Council for Innovation (CCI) asked the agency for clear regulatory guidance on crypto staking and staking services.

In a new strategy session, Pizzino tells his 351,000 YouTube subscribers that traditional assets such as stocks and real estate are in the correction phase of the 18-year property cycle theory popularized by land economist Fred Harrison. The theory states that the property market rotates between a boom phase that lasts for 14 years and a bust period that lasts four years. According to Pizzino, Bitcoin could precede the traditional assets in undergoing a major market correction. “I wouldn’t expect Bitcoin to peak at the same time that the stock market does or even at the same time that the real estate and the economy peaks. And if that peak is due sometime around 2026… let’s call it the first half of 2026… …so being conservative, I would look for a peak in Bitcoin before that happens. So before the peak sometime in the first half of 2026. If we’re lucky, maybe this thing peaks in the first half, maybe quarter one.” Source: Jason Pizzino/ YouTube According to the crypto analyst, Bitcoin is, however, primed to reach a new all-time high before the major market correction occurs. “If BTC is able to break through this level [around $106,000], then my next target of course, you’ve got the highs here around $108,000 to $109,000… but the 75% of our swing move [from around $74,000] here takes us out to $111,000. Now if this is going to do a repeat of this 100%, that’ll take you to $117,000…” Source: Jason Pizzino/ YouTube Bitcoin is trading at $103,912 at time of writing, down by nearly 5% from the all-time high of just under $109,000 reached in January. ?

Meanwhile, the altcoins also face a small pullback, including Avalanche, whose price has dropped from the local highs at $26.88. In the times when the token has been experiencing equal bullish and bearish pressure, here’s what to expect from the AVAX price rally in the next couple of weeks. Key Support and Resistance Levels for AVAX The volatility of the token has increased ever since the price jumped above horizontal consolidation during the last quarter of 2024. Meanwhile, despite the correction that followed, the market participants appear to remain extremely bullish over the token, as the network’s high-speed subnets have been a game changer. Therefore, the AVAX price is believed to rise to $0.26 in the next 10 days if the momentum continues to build. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : eToro CEO Reveals $5 Bitcoin Buy and $50M Exit – Here’s the Wild Story , Bullish Momentum and Price Targets Ahead Despite the bearish pullback, the Gaussian channel remains bullish, which keeps the bullish possibility alive.

However, the MACD shows a drop in the buying pressure with a possibility of a bearish crossover. However, the levels remain within the bullish range, which keeps the hopes of a bullish reversal alive. Hence, the Avalanche price is believed to test the average bands of the rising parallel channel of around $21.45 that could offer a strong base to trigger a rebound. Meanwhile, a rise above $28 could only elevate the levels above the bearish influence and a rise above $30 could reinstate a bull run to $50. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The breach, which the company estimates could cost up to $400 million in remediation and reimbursements, involved cybercriminals bribing overseas customer service representatives to gain unauthorized access to sensitive user data. Among the Coinbase Global Inc. customers whose personal information was compromised in a hack of the exchange was Sequoia Capital Managing partner Roelof Botha, a person familiar with the matter said. The source, who requested anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the information, confirmed that details linked to Botha’s Coinbase account—including his phone number, address, and other personal data—were compromised. Coinbase refuses $20M ransom as hackers target high-profile investors Coinbase revealed on Thursday that attackers had paid off customer service representatives in India with cash to obtain client information illicitly. Bloomberg News reported that the stolen content contained names, dates of birth, addresses, nationalities, government ID numbers, some banking data, and information about the creation dates and balance of accounts. The hackers later asked for $20 million in ransom from Coinbase to not disclose the breach, which was an extortion attempt that the company declined. Coinbase said in an interview with Bloomberg that strange logs from some of its customer service representatives were noticed as early as January. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said the company was refusing to pay the ransom and would instead offer a $20 million bounty for anyone who provided information that led to the attackers’ arrest. The fact that the attackers obtained Botha’s previously unreported information suggests they were specifically targeting wealthy and influential individuals. Botha is a member of the so-called PayPal Mafia, a group of former PayPal employees that includes notable figures like Peter Thiel and Elon Musk. He joined Sequoia, one of the world’s leading venture capital firms, in 2003, where he made early investments in companies such as YouTube and Instagram. He became the firm’s senior steward in 2022. Coinbase declined to comment on the incident. Botha did not respond to requests for comment, and Sequoia Capital also declined to speak on the matter. According to the source, some Coinbase customers received alerts last weekend notifying them that their information may have been improperly accessed. The cyber attack comes days before the US company is set to join the benchmark S&P 500 index, a landmark moment for the crypto industry. It also reflects how, as it grows, the industry has increasingly become a target for cybercriminals. Crypto execs face new threats as France races to curb kidnappings and hacks A report from research firm Chainalysis suggests funds stolen from crypto businesses totaled $2.2 billion in 2024. The security of crypto executives has become an increasing concern as the industry gains visibility. On Friday, France’s interior ministry convened a group of industry leaders to outline immediate measures aimed at curbing a recent wave of kidnappings targeting crypto executives. These actions include special security checks at the homes of crypto leaders and tailored briefings for them and their families. This meeting followed a failed daylight kidnapping attempt targeting the daughter and grandson of the CEO of Paymium, a cryptocurrency exchange based in Paris. Before this, the father of another crypto millionaire was abducted but released two days later. The cryptocurrency sector has long been a target for hackers. In February, suspected North Korean attackers exploited the Bybit exchange, resulting in a $1.5 billion breach that security experts described as the largest of its kind to date.

Pi Network Co-Founder Explains,https://cryptopotato.com/why-is-the-pi-army-so-passionate-pi-network-co-founder-explains/,"TL;DR Nicolas Kokkalis, co-founder of the popular yet controversial project, spoke at the 2025 Consensus conference in Toronto about topics ranging from blockchain adoption to decentralization to AI and, yes, PI’s growing popularity and vocal community. However, the native token seems to have fallen victim to yet another ‘buy the rumors, sell the news’ case following a fresh price plunge. Why So Popular? Despite its controversial history, which included years of delaying the actual network launch and token release, Pi Network has grown to be one of the most popular and talked-about projects in the cryptocurrency space. After all, it has been in existence, in some form, for roughly half a decade. During the recent appearance at the 2025 Consensus conference in Toronto, Kokkalis was asked about this growing popularity, where it stems from, and if the community is vocal on Pi or decentralization in general. The project’s co-founder, who is also the head of technology, believes the main reason behind this popularity is the concept of value capture. “In the future, where more and more work is being done by agents and AI, it’s important to make sure that the value is not only captured by a few individuals or a few companies. It can be captured by a large number of people. And that’s where blockchain and our projects can come [in]to play.” He added that Pi Network’s popularity can continue rising if all projects within its ecosystem work toward capturing value for a larger number of people. PI Dumps Hard Just over a week ago, PI’s price started to climb aggressively and it surged from $0.6 to $1.7 within days. This massive ascent transpired after the team behind the project hinted about a big announcement coming on May 14. Once that was revealed , which turned out to be a $100 million fund designated for ecosystem investments, PI started to nose dive. Earlier today, it fell below $0.7 after another double-digit daily decline. As such, it has almost erased all gains registered from the hype-driven rally, which makes it another ‘sell the news’ event. PI Token Price.

Hackers executed the attack after bribing the platform’s overseas support agents to steal confidential data and use it in social engineering attacks. Coinbase has fired staff involved in the breach and plans to press criminal charges. Cyberattack Could Cost Cost Coinbase $400 Million Coinbase revealed it was contacted by hackers who claimed to have access to confidential customer data obtained by bribing overseas Coinbase contractors and employees. Coinbase stated in an official blog post that the hackers had gained access to less than 1% of its customer data. The hackers used the data to impersonate official Coinbase communication and trick users into handing over their assets. The hackers then contacted Coinbase, claiming they had access to confidential information about customer accounts and internal documentation, including material related to customer service and account management systems. The hackers demanded $20 million from Coinbase to disclose the information publicly. However, Coinbase refused to give in to their demands and notified law enforcement agencies about the breach. Coinbase stated in its blog post, “Criminals targeted our customer support agents overseas. They used cash offers to convince a small group of insiders to copy data in our customer support tools for less than 1% of Coinbase monthly transacting users. Their aim was to gather a customer list they could contact while pretending to be Coinbase—tricking people into handing over their crypto. They then tried to extort Coinbase for $20 million to cover this up.” Passwords, Private Keys Not Compromised Coinbase assured users that passwords and private keys were not compromised. However, the hackers could have gained access to names, addresses, phone numbers, and emails. Affected data also included masked bank account numbers, government ID images, and account balances. “No passwords, private keys, or funds were exposed, and Coinbase Prime accounts are untouched. We will reimburse customers who were tricked into sending funds to the attacker. We’re cooperating closely with law enforcement to pursue the harshest penalties possible and will not pay the $20 million ransom demand we received.” The attack comes days before Coinbase joins the benchmark S&P 500 index, a landmark moment for crypto. It also reflects how the industry has become a target for hackers as it grows. Nick Jones, founder of crypto firm Zumo, stated, “Security remains a challenge for the crypto industry despite its growing mainstream acceptance. As our nascent industry grows rapidly, it draws the eye of bad actors, who are becoming increasingly sophisticated in the scope of their attacks.” Coinbase Establishing Reward Fund Coinbase stated that it would reimburse all customers tricked into sending funds to the hackers. It also revealed that it is establishing a $20 million reward fund for any information that leads to the arrest and conviction of the individuals responsible for the hack. “We will reimburse customers who were tricked into sending funds to the attacker. We are establishing a $20 million reward fund for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the criminals responsible for this attack.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

In a post shared with his followers on X, he referenced a 2025 letter from the Institute of International Finance (IIF) to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), which acknowledged XRP as a leading private sector initiative enhancing cross-border payments. In a 2025 letter to the Bank for International Settlements, the Institute of International Finance spotlighted ISO 20022 and Ripple’s XRP as leading private sector solutions/initiatives that are enhancing cross-border payments. Documented. pic.twitter.com/dsOPO0I5x6 — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) May 15, 2025 This development is notable because it shows the growing recognition and legitimacy of cryptocurrencies, XRP specifically, within global financial discussions. IIF’s Endorsement of ISO 20022 and XRP The IIF, representing some of the world’s largest financial institutions, addressed the BIS with insights on modernizing payment infrastructures. The letter highlighted ISO 20022 as a pivotal standard driving efficiency in cross-border transactions. Importantly, the IIF also identified XRP as an example of private-sector innovation contributing to this goal. This acknowledgment places the digital asset alongside ISO 20022 as a tool for improving speed, transparency, and cost-effectiveness in global payment systems. The fact that IIF mentions XRP is a notable milestone. Traditionally, discussions at the BIS level have centered on public sector initiatives and banking consortia. Including XRP signifies recognition of its practical utility in bridging gaps within the existing financial infrastructure. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP and Ripple’s payment network are a superior alternative to legacy systems like SWIFT. By spotlighting Ripple’s solution, the IIF shows the relevance of blockchain technology in addressing long-standing inefficiencies in cross-border payments. A New XRP-powered Financial System The IIF’s reference to XRP carries weight, especially in the context of global regulatory bodies evaluating digital assets’ roles in the financial system. Ripple’s focus on compliance, interoperability, and real-world application aligns with the goals of institutions like the BIS. The IIF also highlighted SWIFT’s upcoming migration to the ISO 20022 standard in December, which many experts believe will favor the digital asset. By aligning with the ISO 20022 standard , Ripple’s technology ensures compatibility with traditional financial systems while offering the benefits of blockchain-based solutions. This development reinforces Ripple’s positioning as a bridge between legacy payment networks and the emerging digital economy. The IIF’s letter further validates Ripple’s efforts to integrate digital assets into mainstream financial workflows. For XRP, this recognition may influence how policymakers and financial institutions perceive its role in future payment systems.

That’s exactly the kind of talk buzzing around BTFD Coin this week as it enters the final 10 days of its presale. Meanwhile, Dogecoin just spiked over 8% in the last 7 days, and Bonk is gaining momentum with consistent upward movement. These three are shaping up as the best new meme coins for significant returns —and the clock is ticking on the biggest upside of them all. While DOGE and BONK are showing strength in the current meme coin revival, BTFD isn’t just another project riding the wave—it’s building its own surfboard. With a powerful Play-to-Earn game, 90% staking APY, and now a referral program that literally pays the community to bring in fresh bulls, this is a momentum cocktail that crypto traders can’t ignore. Add a projected moon price of $0.006 and a 200% bonus for buyers, and the hype writes itself. BTFD Coin: $0.0002 Now, $0.006 Later—Plus Referral Rewards That Stack What makes BTFD so different? Start with the numbers. The current meme coin presale price is just $0.0002. With the LAUNCH200 bonus , a $10,000 investment turns into 150 million tokens. When BTFD lists at $0.0006, that becomes $90,000. And if it hits its projected moon price of $0.006, that same investment could skyrocket to $900,000. That’s not theory—that’s a potential 8900% ROI. But here’s where it gets interesting. BTFD is offering a referral program that rewards both sides. Share a personal code, and buyers who spend $50 or more during the meme coin presale get 10% extra BTFD tokens. The referrer earns 10% of that purchase—but only if they make it into the top 20 on the leaderboard. The competition resets monthly, and payouts are based on the total raise value, giving serious shillers and crypto promoters a real incentive to get loud. This program transforms every buyer into a mini-marketer, turning community growth into a full-blown race. It’s not just about riding the bull run—it’s about helping drive it. That level of community gamification makes BTFD one of the best new meme coins for significant returns, especially for social-savvy investors and Gen Z crypto heads who know how to move influence into income. Want in before the rocket lifts? It’s simple. Connect a MetaMask or Trust Wallet to the presale page , fund it with ETH, BNB, or USDT, and select the amount to buy. The 200% bonus applies automatically when LAUNCH200 is used, and the tokens can be claimed right after the presale closes at 23:59 UTC on May 26. From there, staking and in-game rewards begin vesting post-launch on May 27. With $7 million+ already raised, over 74 billion tokens sold, and 12,200+ bulls in the project’s community stampede, BTFD’s 15-stage meme coin presale is nearly at the finish line. The final stage awaits, but the real question is—who’s going to own the dip before it moons?. BONK Climbs as Volume Stabilizes Bonk is back in the spotlight, trading at $0.00002134 after gaining 4.43% over the last 7 days. Though the 24-hour volume dipped slightly by 0.06%, its market momentum is still running warm. Investors are increasingly eyeing BONK for its community-driven approach, creative branding, and presence in meme coin conversations on social media. It’s not just hype either. Bonk has become one of the standout Solana-based meme projects and is starting to resonate with a broader global base—especially retail investors in Asia and Latin America. As its community builds, Bonk is slipping onto more traders’ watchlists, helping solidify its place among the best new meme coins for significant returns. Bonk’s long-term visibility in the meme space and steadily increasing buy pressure make it an asset that could surprise in the next altseason wave. DOGE Surges Over 8% as Volume Explodes Dogecoin continues its dominant presence, trading at $0.2254 and jumping 8.48% in the last 7 days. What’s fueling it? A serious 21.26% surge in trading volume, signaling rising demand and fresh liquidity entering the space. Even after more than a decade in crypto, DOGE proves again why it’s still the meme coin king. DOGE’s real strength lies in adoption. From Elon Musk tweets to payment integrations and brand partnerships, DOGE is the poster child for meme coin legitimacy. It’s got the trust, liquidity, and cultural clout to justify its place among the best new meme coins for significant returns. Traders looking for reliable exposure to meme momentum without chasing early-stage volatility often park funds in DOGE.

Codename:Pepe is going for launch. Dogecoin’s recent rally: Can the uptrend continue? Dogecoin has experienced a remarkable increase in its price recently. In the past week, the price surged by 32.97%. Over the last month, it climbed by 45.23%. This significant growth suggests a renewed interest in the cryptocurrency and a potential shift in market sentiment. Despite these gains, Dogecoin is still down by 39.92% compared to six months ago. The current price fluctuates between $0.1768 and $0.2726, indicating some volatility. This disparity highlights that while short-term performance is strong, the coin has yet to recover fully from earlier declines. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 44.43. An RSI below 50 implies that the asset is not overbought, leaving room for further price appreciation. The nearest resistance level is at $0.3141. Breaking through this point could signal continued upward momentum and attract more buyers into the market. On the other hand, the nearest support level is at $0.1225. If the price moves toward this point, it might indicate a reversal of the recent uptrend. If Dogecoin maintains its current trajectory, reaching the resistance level would mean an increase of around 15% from the upper end of its current price range. Conversely, moving down to the support level would represent a decrease of about 27% from the lower end of the current price. Conclusion As the market experiences a bullish surge, Codename:Pepe crypto emerges as a standout contender. While established coins like DOGE, SHIB, PEPE, and FLOKI have had impressive runs, their short-term potential appears less promising compared to the fresh momentum of Codename:Pepe crypto. By harnessing true artificial intelligence for market insights and automated trading, Codename:Pepe crypto offers a unique opportunity for significant gains. Its community-driven mission and unique features position it as a compelling choice for investors seeking to maximize profits during the current market upswing.

Procolored printer drivers were found to contain cryptocurrency-stealing malware. Twelve people have been arrested in the US, accused of running a $263 million cryptocurrency fraud scheme. Dior has confirmed a cyberattack and data breach. Telegram has removed casino bots from its platform. Procolored printer drivers contained a cryptocurrency stealer For at least six months, the official software shipped with Procolored printers included a remote access trojan and a cryptocurrency stealer. This was first pointed out by YouTube blogger Serial Hobbyism. After installing the drivers for the Procolored V11 Pro UV printer, the user detected the Floxif USB worm on their computer using antivirus software. Third-party experts helped the blogger discover that at least six printer models (F8, F13, F13 Pro, V6, V11 Pro, and VF13 Pro), whose associated software was hosted on the Mega file-sharing platform, contained the XRedRAT trojan and the SnipVex clipper. The latter infects .exe files and replaces Bitcoin addresses in the clipboard. The address SnipVex is using to drain the stolen cryptocurrency has received about 9,308 BTC (~$1 million at the time of the report). The malicious software packages have already been removed, and an internal investigation has been launched. The U.S. has arrested 12 defendants accused of cryptocurrency fraud totaling $263 million. US authorities have charged 12 individuals in a cybercrime conspiracy to commit extortion, fraud, and money laundering that netted them more than $263 million. According to the DOJ, from October 2023 through March 2025, the group of U.S. and foreign nationals engaged in database hacking, phishing, and apartment burglaries to steal cryptocurrency hardware wallets. The criminal proceeds were spent on nightclubs, private jet rentals, security guards, and sports cars worth up to $3.8 million. $9 million was spent on exotic cars alone, with another $4 million spent on parties. Part of the scheme was uncovered with the help of crypto detective ZachXBT, who in August 2024 traced the theft of nearly 4,100 BTC from an early crypto investor. The investigation is ongoing. Dior confirms cyberattack and data breach French luxury brand Dior reported a cybersecurity incident that was discovered on May 7, in which unidentified individuals gained unauthorized access to partial customer information. The affected data includes names, gender, phone numbers, emails, addresses, purchase history, and preferences. The company assured that the database did not contain account passwords or financial information, including bank details, card details, or IBANs. Steps have been taken to limit the breach, and an investigation with cybersecurity experts is underway. The Personal Data Protection Commission and affected customers have been notified of the situation. The number of those affected and their regions of residence have not been disclosed. Telegram has removed casino bots Telegram has removed the largest gambling project on the platform, @CasinoBot. A number of other major projects with audiences in the millions were also targeted in the large-scale sweep, according to 'Durov's Code.' The messenger had previously blocked keywords such as 'casino,' 'freespin,' and others in searches, depriving such projects of organic traffic. Telegram is allegedly stepping up content moderation amid rumors of a probable IPO to minimize possible regulatory claims. Alleged BlackDB admin extradited to the US from Kosovo Liridon Mazurica, a 33-year-old citizen of Kosovo, was extradited to the United States on charges of running the cybercrime marketplace BlackDB, which has been operating since 2018, according to the Ministry of Justice. According to the prosecution, the defendant was the lead administrator of the platform that sold compromised accounts, server data, stolen credit card numbers, and personal information about individuals, most of whom are U.S. citizens. The first court hearing has already taken place. The defendant was charged with five counts of fraudulent use of unauthorized access devices and one count of conspiracy to commit fraud. He faces up to 55 years in prison. In turn, a 45-year-old ”foreign national” suspected of using the DoppelPaymer ransomware virus has been arrested in Moldova. Authorities believe the individual was behind a series of cyberattacks on Dutch organizations in 2021. One of the victims was NWO, which suffered damages of around €4.5 million.

The correction comes after days of heavy buying pressure and growing expectations of a broader altseason. However, the recent pullback has sparked debate among analysts and traders, with sentiment now split between those anticipating another leg up and others preparing for a deeper correction. Related Reading: Ethereum Multi-Year Consolidation Could Spark A Parabolic Move – Details Some believe this pause is healthy and necessary before Ethereum resumes its uptrend. Others argue that ETH could retest lower zones, especially if Bitcoin remains range-bound. Top analyst Daan weighed in by highlighting the ETH/BTC pair, pointing out that Ethereum, after its big move up, is now facing resistance around the 0.026 BTC level. With Ethereum still trading far below its all-time high and caught in a wide macro range, the coming days may prove decisive. Whether this is just a short-term cooldown or the start of a larger correction, Ethereum’s current levels will likely dictate the momentum heading into the next phase of the market. Ethereum Holds Critical Support As ETH/BTC Pair Faces Key Resistance Ethereum continues to show resilience despite recent volatility, maintaining its position above the $2,400 level. This zone now acts as crucial support, and bulls must defend it to preserve the broader bullish momentum. While price action has cooled slightly following its sharp run to $2,730, ETH remains one of the stronger performers in the market, holding up well amid increased uncertainty and speculative positioning. Much of the current optimism hinges on Ethereum’s performance relative to Bitcoin. If ETH continues to outperform BTC, analysts believe it could trigger the long-awaited altseason — a market phase where altcoins significantly outperform Bitcoin. Daan shared insights on this dynamic, focusing on the ETH/BTC ratio, which has gained notable strength in recent sessions. According to Daan, ETH has now run into resistance near the 0.026 level after a sharp rally. For bullish momentum to continue, ETH must hold above 0.0224. A break below this key support could trigger a slow bleed and potentially unwind the entire recent move. On the upside, a clear break above 0.026 would open the door to a move toward 0.03 and beyond. In short, Ethereum’s short-term direction will likely be shaped by its ability to hold $2,400 and maintain strength against Bitcoin. If both conditions are met, the case for a sustained altcoin rally grows significantly stronger.

The chart shows that ETH failed to hold above the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) at $2,701, which acted as a strong resistance zone. After days of sustained upward momentum, this rejection has pushed the price back toward the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) around $2,438 — a key level that now serves as immediate support. Volume has remained elevated during this move, suggesting active participation from both bulls and bears. Despite the rejection from the 200 SMA, Ethereum is still holding well above its breakout zone from early May, where the price surged from under $2,000. If bulls can defend the EMA and keep price above $2,400, this could form a higher low and set the stage for another attempt at reclaiming the $2,700–$2,800 area.

A growing share of capital is being rotated into MAGACOINFINANCE, a new altcoin combining political branding with structured tokenomics—appealing to traders who want more than hype. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x DOGE and TRUMP: Momentum and Risk Collide Dogecoin is currently trading at $0.224 , bolstered by 9% daily growth and fresh institutional interest. The launch of Coinbase Dogecoin futures and the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust has revived retail enthusiasm. Elon Musk’s recent posts hinting at DOGE integration into X (formerly Twitter) payments continue to drive speculative volume. TRUMPCOIN, meanwhile, remains a political force. Riding on endorsements from Trump-affiliated platforms and announcements of strategic crypto partnerships, the token has seen significant inflows. However, concerns are mounting around regulatory scrutiny and centralized influence—especially as Trump’s camp pushes for a Bitcoin reserve tied to U.S. policy.

According to a report by digital asset platform Fireblocks, exactly 90% of organizations surveyed are actively working with these tools or preparing to integrate them. The study surveyed 295 executives from traditional banks, financial institutions, fintech companies, and payment gateways. Nearly half of respondents (49%) are already using stablecoins to make payments, 23% are pilot testing, and 18% are in the planning stages. Only one in ten survey participants has not yet decided on an implementation. ”The stablecoin race has become a matter of avoiding obsolescence as customer demand accelerates and use cases mature,” the Fireblocks report notes. Banks Are Betting on Cross-Border Payments Traditional cross-border systems suffer from high costs, delays, and other inefficiencies. In this context, stablecoins are becoming a strategic solution, especially in the business environment of emerging markets. According to the report, financial institutions, especially traditional banks, are prioritizing cross-border payments as a key area for the use of stablecoins. Banks are using these tools to gain a competitive advantage, reduce friction, and meet customer expectations. The study found that 58% of traditional banks use stablecoins for cross-border payments, while 28% accept payments with them. To optimize liquidity, 12% of banks use these instruments, 9% use them for merchant payments, and another 9% use them for B2B invoicing. Fireblocks notes that banks see stablecoins as a ”path to modernization.” Because these assets are tied to fiat currencies, they are easier to integrate into existing treasury processes. In addition, stablecoins provide an opportunity to regain market share from fintech companies and reduce capital lock-in. Speed Is the Main Advantage of Stablecoins Survey results show that banks are using stablecoins to rebuild cross-border transaction volumes while maintaining existing infrastructure. Fintech companies and payment gateways are using digital assets to increase margins and revenues. Among the benefits mentioned by survey participants, the most common was faster settlement, noted by 48% of respondents. Other benefits include greater transparency, improved liquidity management, integrated payment flows, enhanced security, and lower transaction costs. According to Ran Goldi, senior vice president of payments and network at Fireblocks, the adoption of stablecoins has moved beyond simple cost savings and is now seen as a strategic growth driver. ”Our research shows that 90% of companies are moving forward with the adoption of stablecoins because they see it as a key lever for growth,” Goldi reported. The executive said the main motivators are entering new markets, responding to direct customer demand, and opening up new revenue opportunities. ”Stablecoins have become an engine of business innovation, not just a tool to increase efficiency,” he added. Fireblocks' massive survey demonstrates that stablecoins have evolved from a niche financial instrument to a strategic solution for traditional institutions. The survey results clearly show that the financial sector is actively transforming, mastering digital technologies to improve efficiency and competitiveness. Regulatory Landscape Shapes Stablecoin Adoption As stablecoins become more widely used by financial institutions, the regulatory environment is playing an increasingly significant role in shaping adoption strategies. Around the world, governments and financial regulators are working to establish clear guidelines for the issuance, management, and use of stablecoins. The aim is to ensure consumer protection, prevent illicit activities, and maintain financial system stability. Many executives surveyed by Fireblocks cited regulatory clarity as a key factor influencing their decision to adopt stablecoins. In regions where comprehensive regulations are in place or forthcoming, institutions report greater confidence in integrating these digital assets into their operations. Conversely, uncertainty or restrictive policies can slow down innovation and delay implementation. For example, the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, set to come into effect in 2025, is expected to provide a robust framework for stablecoin issuers and users. In the United States, ongoing discussions around stablecoin legislation are closely watched by banks and fintech companies alike. Industry experts agree that collaboration between regulators and the private sector will be essential to unlocking the full potential of stablecoins. By establishing transparent rules and fostering innovation, regulators can help financial institutions leverage stablecoins to drive efficiency, enhance customer experiences, and support the digital transformation of the global financial system.",News|Markets,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-17 10:11:55

On May 15, prosecutor Irene Rolón confirmed that four individuals were intercepted after breaking into a restricted section of Teratech SA’s mining site in Coronel Bogado. The group was caught shortly after breaching the secured area, prompting immediate action from local police. Three Chinese Nationals Deported in Paraguay Three of the suspects, identified as Chinese nationals Jinping Duan, Tian Jianyun, and Zheng Guanglong, were deported after authorities discovered they had no official entry records. Investigators believe they may have entered Paraguay illegally through Brazil or Bolivia. The fourth suspect, Nahun María Velázquez Garcete, is a Paraguayan resident and is facing charges of aggravated theft. He is currently in pretrial detention after being hospitalized in critical condition. The nature of his injuries remains undisclosed. Authorities suspect that the group may have had prior ties to Teratech as independent contractors, but confirmation is pending a statement from the company’s CEO. Prosecutors also believe more individuals may have been involved, and efforts are ongoing to identify additional suspects. Rolón noted that the undocumented individuals claimed to be programmers, potentially working in the region for several months. However, their connection to Teratech remains unclear. The attempted heist underscores growing concerns around security near Paraguay’s energy-rich regions. The Itaipu dam, one of the largest hydroelectric projects in the world, has attracted crypto miners due to its surplus power and low costs, making it a key site for mining activity in Latin America. The investigation remains open as officials work to determine the full extent of the operation. Bitcoin Mining’s Sustainable Energy Usage Rises to 52% Meanwhole, a recent study from Cambridge University shows that sustainable energy now powers 52.4% of Bitcoin mining , a significant increase from 37.6% reported in 2022. According to the report, 42.6% of Bitcoin mining’s sustainable energy comes from renewables like wind and hydropower, while 9.8% is sourced from nuclear energy. Natural gas has now overtaken coal as the largest energy contributor to Bitcoin mining, with usage rising to 38.2%, compared to 25% in 2022. Coal’s share, meanwhile, has fallen sharply to 8.9% from 36.6%. The United States became a global leader in Bitcoin mining following China’s 2021 crackdown on the crypto industry. With cheap electricity and strong capital markets, American mining firms quickly gained dominance, and the election of pro-crypto President Donald Trump initially fueled optimism for continued growth.

44730285,https://timestabloid.com/?p=67434,1747479619,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Everyone’s Looking at SOL and DOGE — Meanwhile, MUTM’s Price Is About to Change",https://timestabloid.com/everyones-looking-at-sol-and-doge-meanwhile-mutms-price/,"While much of the crypto chatter continues to orbit around popular names like Dogecoin and Solana, a different kind of opportunity is quietly unfolding — one that isn’t built on meme culture or historical market cycles. As the spotlight remains fixed on familiar tokens, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is preparing for its next price move, and investors are already shifting their attention. The project’s fourth presale phase is now nearing full capacity, and once the allocation is complete, the token’s price will increase from $0.025 to $0.03. As new buyers enter and supply thins, the shift in entry cost is inevitable — and rapidly approaching. DOGE and SOL have long held investor interest. Their price movements, community buzz, and exchange presence keep them in headlines — but much of that traction is driven by legacy momentum. The reality is that many of those entering now are chasing performance that already happened. What’s happening with Mutuum Finance is fundamentally different. Rather than riding on past hype, it’s building utility and infrastructure that hasn’t even gone live yet — giving investors a rare chance to move early on a platform that’s still in its formative phase. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) MUTM’s development isn’t centered on speculation — it’s focused on delivering a protocol that simplifies and expands access to borrowing and lending through a self-sustaining economic model. The system generates protocol revenue through user participation, and instead of creating inflationary rewards, it uses that income to buy tokens from the open market. These tokens are then redistributed within the ecosystem — directly linking usage with value. It’s a mechanism designed to fuel consistent demand, not just at launch, but over the long term. Mutuum is also set to roll out a beta version of its platform at the time of token listing, giving early participants direct access to core features right from launch. Unlike many tokens that hit exchanges with no active product, MUTM will debut with real features available from day one — a launch strategy that significantly boosts investor confidence. Many analysts following the project are pointing to a post-launch breakout. Based on community momentum, utility rollout, and the revenue model in place, a price target of $0.50 in the weeks following launch is gaining traction among long-term backers. That forecast represents a potential 1,900% increase from the current presale price of $0.025. Put into perspective: an investor entering now with $4,000 would be holding an asset worth $80,000 when MUTM reaches that mark. And given the project’s smart token distribution and rising demand, such a move isn’t far-fetched — especially as it gears up to hit major exchanges. So far, more than $8.2 million has already been raised, and the number of holders has climbed past 9,800. That kind of early momentum is a strong signal — particularly for a token that hasn’t even launched yet. What’s also adding to the project’s credibility is its ongoing audit by CertiK, one of the top smart contract auditors in the space. This security step is helping assure investors that they’re not only joining early — they’re joining into a framework built with transparency and long-term accountability in mind. With nearly 80% of the current presale phase already sold out, time is genuinely limited. Once Phase 5 kicks in, the token will be priced at $0.03 — a 20% increase from where it sits now. While still early, it marks the beginning of a climb that could close the window for those seeking the best price-to-value ratio. MUTM is increasingly being discussed among those looking for the best crypto to buy now, not because it’s trending — but because it’s structured to grow. While eyes stay fixed on DOGE and SOL, the real upside may be quietly forming elsewhere. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has the development, the backing, the vision — and most importantly, the timing. The token is still priced at $0.025, but the next phase will change that. For those looking at what crypto to invest in, waiting may mean watching the breakout from the sidelines.

SUI’s Speed Impresses, DOGE ETF Enters SEC Review",https://thecoinrise.com/traders-rush-to-secure-millions-in-blockdags-daily-buyer-battles-suis-speed-impresses-doge-etf-enters-sec-review/,"SUI is making waves with a massive 297,000 TPS and attracting big names like Andreessen Horowitz. Over on the meme coin side, Dogecoin’s new ETF from 21Shares is stirring up fresh excitement, bringing Wall Street’s influence to the table. But while others talk, BlockDAG (BDAG) is delivering. Its daily 150 BDAG coin battles are creating serious action, with high-stakes competition fueling its momentum. With 20.5 billion coins sold, 170,000+ holders, and nearly $255 million raised, BlockDAG isn’t just about future promises, it’s showing solid, real-time growth and stacking wins like never before. SEC Starts Review of 21Shares Dogecoin ETF Filing 21Shares has officially filed for a Dogecoin ETF, and the U.S. SEC has now acknowledged it. This kicks off a 240-day review period, which is the first step toward possible approval. The 21Shares Dogecoin ETF joins other filings, including Grayscale’s, which the SEC started reviewing earlier in February. While this acknowledgment puts it on the record, approval isn’t a sure thing. The SEC is expected to make a final decision by January 9, 2026. With Paul Atkins at the helm, the SEC is also reviewing other altcoin ETFs, with potential approvals happening as soon as October. However, approval for a spot Dogecoin ETF still hangs in the balance. SUI: Scaling to 297K TPS with Big Backers on Board Sui has made impressive moves in the crypto space, surging nearly 290% in the past year. As an independent Layer-1 blockchain, it’s designed for speed and efficiency, with a capped supply of 10 billion tokens. Its object-centric approach, where each on-chain asset gets a unique ID, boosts transparency. Backed by major players like Andreessen Horowitz and Binance Labs, Sui is primed for future growth. With a transaction capacity of up to 297,000 per second and a quick 400-millisecond finality, it stands out from the competition. As Sui continues to evolve, its future updates are definitely worth keeping an eye on. BlockDAG’s High-Stakes Buyer Battles Drive Presale to $255M! Traditional crypto reward programs often feel like a grind – fixed rates, predictable rewards, and limited options for strategic moves. But BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles turn this idea on its head. Every day, 150 BDAG coins are up for grabs in an intense competition. The clock resets every 24 hours, so each day brings a fresh opportunity to stack up. What really sets this apart is the high-energy competition. If all 150 coins aren’t claimed by the end of the day, the remaining coins roll over to the top buyer. It’s a brilliant twist that rewards those who lead the charge, turning every transaction into a game of strategy. This isn’t for the passive holder, it’s for the active, quick-moving player who knows that timing is crucial in the crypto world. BlockDAG is already at Batch 28, with its current price at $0.0262, offering early buyers a massive 2,520% ROI. But here’s the kicker – BlockDAG has locked in a special price of $0.0020 until June 13. This means there’s a limited-time chance to grab BDAG at a significantly lower rate, setting the stage for major gains when the price hits $0.05. This is a golden opportunity for those looking to level up their game with the most profitable crypto asset before the next big price surge. Final Thoughts BlockDAG isn’t just talking big, it’s delivering. With 20.5 billion coins sold, over 170,000 holders, and $255 million raised, it’s already in a league of its own. The 150 BDAG coin battles add extra excitement, rewarding those who know how to make bold moves. Meanwhile, SUI’s future is looking bright, boasting an impressive 297,000 TPS and backing from top investors like Andreessen Horowitz. On the meme coin front, Dogecoin’s new ETF from 21Shares is turning heads, adding some serious Wall Street vibes. But when it comes to real action, BlockDAG is the one stacking wins and showing why it’s the crypto to watch.

BNB Price Builds Momentum & SHIB Targets $0.00003,https://thecoinrise.com/unstakeds-presale-heats-up-at-0-009267-with-6m-raised-bnb-price-builds-momentum-shib-targets-0-00003/,"BNB price is showing strong signs of upward pressure, currently testing the key resistance zone near $653.5 and setting sights on a possible move to $700. At the same time, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has surpassed long-standing resistance levels, prompting some analysts to expect a 124% increase by May. Yet, amid these technical moves, Unstaked is drawing attention for its hands-on approach. Unlike many projects chasing short-term gains, Unstaked has developed autonomous AI agents already connected with Telegram and X. These agents are designed to go live after the project officially launches and will function based on actual performance tracked by a system called Proof of Intelligence. Now in stage 13 of its presale, Unstaked is priced at $0.009267. With real Web3 utility on the way, this project is moving differently from others, offering what few presale cryptos can claim. BNB Price: Approaching a Key Resistance Breakout? Binance Coin (BNB) is nearing a technical threshold as it closes in on a descending resistance line, which historically has led to major moves. Currently trading around $610, BNB is testing the upper limit of a descending wedge structure. A clear breakout above this range, particularly past the 0.236 Fibonacci level at $653.5, could unlock a rally toward $700 or even $792. The daily RSI is rising but remains below overbought levels, indicating further upside potential if resistance is breached. Market watchers will be closely observing this zone, as a breakout could trigger a stronger bullish wave. SHIB Price Surge: Can Shiba Inu Reach $0.00003 in 2025? SHIB recently broke above two significant downtrend lines, signaling a shift in momentum after a lengthy consolidation period. Based on this breakout, experts are forecasting a potential rise of 124%, possibly reaching $0.00003 by May 2025. The current SHIB price sits at around $0.00001373 and is showing strength even after a major sell-off tied to malicious actors. Meanwhile, SHIB’s fundamentals are improving, with a 1,500% increase in daily burns helping reduce supply and support long-term value. Anyone tracking SHIB should watch the resistance zone between $0.0000142 and $0.0000145. Moving beyond that could help confirm the bullish setup. Unstaked: A Real AI System That Rewards Action, Not Hype Rather than promoting vague concepts, Unstaked is building a usable AI system that Web3 platforms can adopt soon. It’s focused on delivering a decentralized layer where smart agents assist DAOs, apps, and communities by managing member onboarding, chat moderation, event scheduling, and outreach, all autonomously. What makes Unstaked stand out is its commitment to working on AI performance. While others promise future tools, Unstaked’s system is already built, with agents ready to be activated post-launch. These agents function based on Unstaked’s Proof of Intelligence, which monitors activity and issues rewards only for successful output. Now in stage 13 of its crypto presale , the price is set at $0.009267. With over $6 million already raised, including $1 million in just 24 hours, the pace is clear. DAOs are taking notice, community interest is rising, and momentum is building. This is not a placeholder waiting to become relevant, it’s on track to launch as a live AI protocol integrated directly into Web3 systems. With a projected ROI of 2700% from its launch price of $0.1819, Unstaked is seen by many as one of the few presale projects offering real functionality. Final Takeaway! BNB price looks close to clearing key resistance, and SHIB may see a jump toward $0.00003 if it breaks above current levels. Still, both depend on market momentum. Unstaked is taking a structured path forward, developing an AI system where agents are already designed to perform actions like moderation and onboarding. Backed by a Proof of Intelligence model that rewards actual output, Unstaked offers a working product priced at $0.009267 in stage 13. It’s not driven by hype. It’s focused on real results in Web3.

Is DOGE a good investment? Dogecoin has strong potential for growth due to its high adoption and strong community.

However, the market speculates that DOGE cannot reach the $10 level in the foreseeable future.

The DOGE/USD pair is expected to reach the $1.37 mark by 2031, so holding it for longer can be beneficial.

Our analysis shows that DOGE could cross $1.31 by 2031. Dogecoin historic price sentiment DOGE price history 2013 was the beginning of Dogecoin, and it surged to $0.0004 in the first days of trading. By March 2014, the coin attempted a breach of $0.001 but failed, closing the year at $0.0001. In the subsequent years, Dogecoin faced immense competition from new coins, including Stellar, Neo, and Monero, which dragged the coin’s price further down. According to the Dogecoin price history, it traded in a strict range of $0.002 to $0.0036 for most of 2019. In January 2021, DOGE saw significant gains, closing the month at $0.037. Subsequently, Dogecoin attained an ATH of $0.7376 on May 8, 2021, but lost 76% of its value, closing the year at $0.1703. In 2022, Dogecoin maintained an average market price of about $0.07. The coin began trading around $0.08 in 2023 and closed the year at $0.08955. In 2024, Dogecoin (DOGE) began consolidating around $0.08, surged above $0.2 during March’s bull run, fluctuated between $0.1011 and $0.1759 through mid-year, spiked to $0.4312 in November, and ended the year at $0.314. In January 2025, DOGE clocked the highest price of $0.41; however, after shedding 38% value, it stepped down to $0.258 in February. In March, DOGE’s value decreased further as it dipped to the $0.20 range, and April saw the lowest DOGE price of $0.142. However, at the start of May, Dogecoin is trading near the $0.170 mark, following some improvement.",Crypto Price Predictions|DOGE,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|MINING|SPONSORED|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-17 11:00:39

The technicals are not completely in favor of the bulls, which hints towards a potential downturn, but the market sentiments remain somewhat bullish, keeping the hopes of an upswing alive. However, the XRP price is required to sustain above a certain support zone, as a failure could invalidate the bullish thesis. Whale Activity and Ripple Moves In the past few days, XRP witnessed huge transfers of over $350 million, with the key movers being identified as Ripple and Crypto.com. They have reportedly moved nearly 50M and 94.3M XRP, while the receiving wallets remain anonymous. However, the previous patterns suggest these funds may be destined for OTC deals or liquidity provisioning. On the other hand, Ripple offloads XRP to cover operations and stabilize markets. Along with this, Ripple also burned 4M RLUSD following a minting pause, which hints at ongoing adjustments in Ripple’s stablecoin strategy as it tests market dynamics. With no new RLUSD minted in the past couple of weeks, all eyes are on the XRP’s next move as it prepares for a potential price action amid rising whale activity. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Rich List: How Much XRP You Need to Become a Millionaire , XRP Technicals Signal Key Resistance Test The XRP price seems to have remained stuck within a crucial phase, as a small bearish divergence could validate a strong bearish move. The 50/200-day MA has converged, displaying the possibility of a potential bearish crossover. Besides, the Gaussian channel has just turned bullish, hinting towards a rise in the bullish dominance that may push the price back to the resistance zone. Meanwhile, the RSI has plunged and is approaching the average range along with CMF, which suggests a drop in the buying volume and volatility. Therefore, the XRP price is believed to maintain a horizontal consolidation between $2.5 and $2.6 for a while, and with an increase in the bullish pressure, a breakout to $2.83 seems to be imminent. With this, the path to $3 could become pretty clear, which may push the levels towards a new ATH. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Layer 2 protocols like Arbitrum and Optimism generate significant fees, but most are burned, making Ethereum deflationary as usage grows. Despite concerns, Ethereum's inability to directly monetize Layer 2 activity is offset by the deflationary impact of fee burning, supporting long-term value. With the recent Pectra update, I see medium- to long-term upside for Ethereum, but recommend monitoring key metrics and maintaining a balanced crypto portfolio. Introduction Repeatedly, and we could say that it is beginning to be vox populi, I have heard or read that Ethereum has a big problem. That it is not able to properly monetise its technological infrastructure, that the protocol itself yields to other layer 2 solutions, rollups or zero knowledge proofs. In today's article we will try to unravel that point, in order to offer a vision of where Ethereum is and some of the solutions that run on its layer, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base or Polygon (PoS). We will study all these protocols from the point of view of fee generation and how they all relate to layer 1 (Ether). Repeatedly, and we could say that it is beginning to be vox populi, I have heard or read that Ethereum has a big problem. That it is not able to properly monetise its technological infrastructure, that the protocol itself yields to other layer 2 solutions, rollups or zero knowledge proofs. In today's article we will try to unravel that point, in order to offer a vision of where Ethereum is and some of the solutions that run on its layer, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base or Polygon (PoS). We will study all these protocols from the point of view of fee generation and how they all relate to layer 1 (Ether). Before we start, we need a bit of context. Ethereum changed its consensus protocol in September 2022 from Proof Of Work (PoW) to Proof Of Stake (PoS) ( The Merge ). The only thing you need to know about this is that it changed the computational power by temporarily locking down the ETH assets held by the miners, now validators. If before you had to dedicate a lot of computational resources to ‘mining’, now you have to block a minimum amount of Ether to be able to validate the chain. We explain this because after this update came several (London, Dencun, Pectra...), but we will stop at the second one; Dencun. Dencun, activated on Ethereum on 13 March 2024, marked a milestone in the evolution of the network by introducing the concept of proto-danksharding through the implementation of EIP-4844. This technical improvement has allowed rollups (such as Arbitrum, Optimism or Base) to publish their data on the core network through a new format called blobs, which is much cheaper than traditional call data. These blobs are temporary data segments (~128 kB each) that cannot be accessed by smart contracts and are automatically deleted after approximately 18 days. The fees associated with these blobs - called blob base fees - are part of a separate market from conventional gas and, like the base fee for traditional gas, are completely burned, reducing the supply of ETH. The impact was immediate: transaction fees for rollups have been reduced by up to 90%, relieving base layer congestion and reinforcing Ethereum's role as an availability and consensus layer. Analysis In this first graph, we show the price evolution of the price of ETH compared to the evolution of the fees generated by layer 2 or zero knowledge protocols, such as Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Polygon ( MATIC ) or zkSync. We have removed from this graph the fees generated by layer 1 ( ETH ) for the sake of clarity. It can be clearly seen, and the spearman correlation coefficients confirm (0.74) that when there is an increase in the generation of fees from these protocols there is an expansion of the price of ETH. Even so, these fees generated do not go to the Ethereum protocol itself, but rather most of them are burned (Base Fees) and only the Priority Fee ends up in the native network, in the form of a reward to the validators that secure the chain itself. For now, we have a key factor in understanding the economics of Ether. The green bars are weekly increases of more than 10% in the generation of these fees, which coincide with local peaks in Ethereum's own price. ETH Fees (Node Analytica) In the following graph, we can see the same as in the previous one, but with a comparison of the price of the Optimism token. As mentioned above, Optimism is a layer 2 rollup that uses Ethereum's infrastructure to guarantee the same levels of security, but optimising transactional capacity and cost. Here too, the local maximums of the asset price coincide with the maximums of the fees generated by the different protocols analysed. The spearman correlation coefficient in this case is slightly lower than the previous one (0.62). The green bars, as in the previous section, signify weekly growth of more than 15% in the fees variable. ETH Fees (Node Analytica) In the following graph, we can see the same as in the previous one, but with a comparison of the price of the Optimism token. As mentioned above, Optimism is a layer 2 roll-up that uses Ethereum's infrastructure to guarantee the same levels of security, but optimising transactional capacity and cost. Here too, the local maximums of the asset price coincide with the maximums of the fees generated by the different protocols analysed. The spearman correlation coefficient in this case is slightly lower than the previous one (0.62). The green bars, as in the previous section, signify weekly growth greater than 15% in the fees variable. To answer the question, we posed at the beginning of this article, is Ethereum not monetising the ‘rent’ of its infrastructure well, and does that pose a short/medium term challenge for the network? We look at the graph below, which relates the price of Ethereum vs. the percentage of fees represented by each of the protocols analysed, including Ethereum. We show data from October 2022, as ‘The Merge’ update was implemented in September 2022. It can be seen that at some points in time, layer 2 solutions are eating into Ethereum's share of total fee generation, but this is not aligned with the price of the asset. There is no correlation. The fact that layer 2 solutions are generating more fees in percentage terms does not mean that the core network is obsolete or does not know how to monetise its technological infrastructure. Because the Ethereum protocol wins on the other hand. While it is true that it does not monetise per se the fact that others use its technological infrastructure, it does burn most of the fees generated by these protocols, which makes the main protocol deflationary if the underlying protocols (layer 2, rollups and zk) have an increase in users and/or transactions. In the end, fees are composed of two elements: Base fee: fee generated by transacting on layer 2 itself, which is always burned. Priority fee: fee paid for faster transaction processing. These fees are not burned and will reward validators who block their Ether to validate the chain. Knowing this, the only fees that enter the main chain are the priority fees, but the entire base fee is burned, reducing the circulating supply of Ethereum. That is the big point of this issue. Ethereum does not directly charge those who use its infrastructure, but it burns most of the Ethereum spent by users interacting with those protocols that use its technology stack. Node Analytica Conclusion In conclusion, I firmly believe that there is no problem in the short/medium term with the issues raised here. If the reader is considering buying Ethereum, I recommend monitoring these types of variables on sites such as Artemis Crypto, Dune Analytics or native blockchain explorers such as Etherscan or Polygonscan. With the new update (Pectra) recently implemented on the network, I think it may be a good time to buy for the medium to long term. As always, beware of short-term volatility, monitor Bitcoin, which is king, and have a balanced portfolio, especially in crypto.",ETH-USD|ETH|ETHA,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|MATIC|TRADING|ARB,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-05-17 11:09:54

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/macro-analyst-believes-xrp-will-unseat-swift-whether-adopt-or-not-heres-why/,"Versan Aljarrah, co-founder of Black Swan Capitalist, has made a definitive statement on the future of international finance. According to Aljarrah, “SWIFT is dead,” believing XRP, which many see as a viable successor, has already taken its place. He wrote, “XRP is the new Swift, they just haven’t admitted it yet.” SWIFT is dead. XRP is the new Swift they just haven't admitted it yet. Headlines will catch up but the system already knows. Either they adopt the tech or get left behind. Because #XRP actually breaks the system and there's nothing they can do about it. pic.twitter.com/NvJrvLXbzH — Versan | Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) May 15, 2025 This assertion reflects a growing belief among cryptocurrency advocates and select financial analysts that XRP is not merely a competitor to SWIFT but its eventual replacement . The sentiment is reinforced by institutional interest in Ripple’s technology and the documented inefficiencies of legacy systems. Institutional Shifts and Industry Readiness Aljarrah shared an image revealing that major financial players know the blockchain’s transformative potential and are actively investing in its development. Institutions such as Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse, and JP Morgan have already aligned themselves with blockchain standardization efforts. However, none of these banks will likely independently build or control a standardized blockchain network. This opens space for Ripple, which specializes in financial services-focused blockchain infrastructure. The image mentions Ripple alongside SWIFT and Bolero as players well-positioned for the evolving trade finance landscape. It acknowledges that companies like Ripple could also play major roles as blockchain adoption grows, though it projects that widespread adoption remains five or more years away. XRP as a Structural Disruptor What differentiates XRP from traditional systems like SWIFT is its ability to function beyond a messaging layer. XRP enables real-time settlement of cross-border payments, potentially removing the need for correspondent banking relationships entirely.

From this perspective, legacy institutions’ resistance is not rooted in technological viability, but in preserving control. The infrastructure underpinning SWIFT is increasingly seen as inadequate for the demands of modern financial activity. Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, has called the legacy system outdated , and XRP offers speed, cost-efficiency, and transparency. Implications for Banks The image warns that banks must keep innovating or risk irrelevance. It emphasizes the importance of end-to-end platforms and operational enablers, arguing that innovation is not about cost-cutting but about staying relevant in a rapidly evolving landscape. As Aljarrah stated, “Either they adopt the tech or get left behind.” Bank of America, a key Ripple partner, has revealed its readiness to adopt crypto payments as more banks move toward the future with blockchain integration. XRP, with its numerous advantages, is best positioned to capitalize on this shift and grow. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

This statement, shared via his X account, suggests a staggering 421,800% increase from XRP’s current trading value of approximately $2.37. Such a prediction has ignited both enthusiasm and skepticism among investors and analysts alike. XRP Captain’s forecast is not an isolated instance of optimism surrounding XRP’s potential. Other figures in the crypto space, such as Pumpius, have echoed similar sentiments. Pumpius projected that XRP could reach $1,000,000, citing Ripple’s significant efforts towards transformative financial infrastructure projects in modern history. According to Pumpius, Ripple has been systematically working with governments, financial institutions, and asset firms across the globe to bring real-world assets (RWAs) on-chain. You heard it first from the #XRP OGs that #XRP is going to hit 10,000$ in future and yes it's true fast and steady growth.

With a circulating supply of approximately 53.6 billion XRP, achieving a $10,000 price point would result in a market capitalization exceeding $536 trillion. This figure surpasses the total estimated global wealth, rendering such a scenario highly improbable under current economic conditions. Realistic Price Targets Despite these challenges, XRP’s utility in facilitating cross-border payments and its adoption by financial institutions cannot be overlooked. Analysts like XForceGlobal, have posited more conservative yet optimistic targets, suggesting that XRP could reach $10 to $20 . Similarly, EGRAG Crypto has projected a $27 price target before the end of 2025, reflecting a significant appreciation from current levels.

While some investors are buoyed by the potential for substantial returns, others urge caution, emphasizing the importance of grounded expectations and the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. As XRP continues to evolve within the digital asset landscape, its trajectory will likely be influenced by regulatory developments, technological advancements, and broader market trends. In conclusion, while the notion of XRP reaching $10,000 is captivating, it remains a speculative prospect that faces significant economic and logistical hurdles. Investors are advised to conduct thorough research and consider a range of scenarios when evaluating the future potential of XRP.

44730598,https://coinpedia.org/?p=456964,1747480385,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,Which Will Yield Bigger Gains: Buying Bitcoin or Bitcoin Treasury Stocks?,https://coinpedia.org/news/which-will-yield-bigger-gains-buying-bitcoin-or-bitcoin-treasury-stocks/,"The post Which Will Yield Bigger Gains: Buying Bitcoin or Bitcoin Treasury Stocks? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Recently, I’ve been looking into the growing trend of companies adding Bitcoin to their treasuries . This shift opens up two main investment options for people like us: buying Bitcoin directly or investing in companies that hold large amounts of Bitcoin. While direct investment is simple and straightforward, Bitcoin treasury stocks offer the potential for higher returns, along with significantly higher risk. Here’s what I found through my research. Bitcoin Investment vs. Bitcoin Treasury Stocks Let’s start with the basics. Buying Bitcoin directly means you own the asset outright. You control it, benefit directly from price movements, and aren’t affected by any external company decisions. It’s straightforward to manage. In contrast, Bitcoin treasury stocks are shares of companies that hold Bitcoin as part of their corporate strategy. MicroStrategy , now renamed Strategy, is a prime example. Investing in these companies gives you exposure to Bitcoin, but with added leverage. That leverage can boost returns in bull markets but also increases your exposure to risks, like company performance, leadership decisions, and broader market volatility. Why Are Companies Stockpiling Bitcoin? This led me to ask: Why are so many companies doing this? The reasons vary. Some companies view Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, while others see it as a strategic way to diversify their treasury. For some firms, especially those with crypto-focused operations like Marathon Digital or CleanSpark, holding Bitcoin is a core part of their business. Others do it primarily to attract crypto-investors or boost shareholder value. MicroStrategy is a unique case. The company went all-in, buying large amounts of Bitcoin using funds raised specifically for that purpose. It became the first public company to acquire over $250 million in Bitcoin , which has since become central to its identity. Real-World Performance: Bitcoin vs. Treasury Stocks Now here’s where the numbers really stood out. As of May 17, 2025, Bitcoin is trading around $103,482— a yearly increase of about 57.65% . Strategy (formerly MSTR), on the other hand, is trading at $399.80 and has surged by 152% in the same period. Since adopting the Bitcoin Standard on August 10, 2020, Strategy has seen a return of over 3,358%, compared to Bitcoin’s 1,028% over the same period. Clearly, treasury stocks like Strategy can outperform Bitcoin during bull markets—but this comes with much higher volatility. But What’s the Catch? This brings us to the risks—because they’re not small. Leverage is a double-edged sword. When Bitcoin drops, these stocks can fall even harder. You also don’t have control. A company can decide to sell its Bitcoin holdings or shift strategies at any time, and that directly impacts your investment. Many of these companies rely heavily on Bitcoin’s success to stay afloat. For example, Strategy’s core software business has declined by 12% over the last decade . If Bitcoin crashes, these companies could face major financial stress, even bankruptcy in extreme cases. There’s also the issue of earnings volatility. Public companies must report their crypto holdings each quarter, and that can result in large fluctuations in reported earnings. Add in security risks—like the $1.5 billion Bybit hack in 2025—and it’s clear this isn’t a risk-free option. Side-by-Side Comparison Metric Bitcoin (BTC) Strategy (MSTR) 5-Year Return 1,028% 3,358% 2025 YTD Return 57.65% 152% Price (May 2025) $103,482 $399.80 Volatility Medium High Control Full None Leverage None Yes Risk from Leadership None High So while treasury stocks have the potential for amplified returns, they carry a much heavier risk load than Bitcoin itself. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Amber International Launches $100M Crypto Reserve to Attract Institutional Investors , Final Thoughts From everything I’ve looked into, here’s the takeaway. If you’re looking for simplicity, control, and a straightforward way to benefit from Bitcoin’s long-term growth, buying Bitcoin or a spot ETF is the best option. You avoid business risks, leadership changes, and financial complexity. But if you’re a high-risk investor aiming for bigger rewards—and you’re confident in the company’s strategy and leadership—Bitcoin treasury stocks could deliver outsized gains. At the end of the day, it all comes down to your risk tolerance and investment goals. Choose the option that aligns best with how much uncertainty you’re willing to take on. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

According to a recent filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the bank now holds 25,656 shares in Strategy, one of the leaders in Bitcoin treasury reserve adoption. Strategy, which used to go by Microstrategy after it changed its name in February, has been one of the biggest buyers of Bitcoin over the last few months. Its executive chairman Michael Saylor has been a huge influence in that aspect, preaching the gospel of the asset. This forward-thinking approach has now been adopted by the Saudi Central Bank, painting a picture of institutional trust in the asset. Saudi central bank shifts to Bitcoin with Strategy stake This move means that the Saudi financial institution now has indirect exposure to Bitcoin, tying a portion of the country’s sovereign wealth to the crypto market. The country has, over the years, relied on its oil, being one of the top producers in the country. This development is coming after the country mentioned recently that it is unwilling to prop up the oil market with further supply cuts. This new shift also means that, aside from relying on its oil, Saudi Arabia is choosing to diversify through Bitcoin. Also, this is not the first time that Saudi Arabia has entered the crypto industry, going by its involvement in a digital currency trial led by China in 2024. The trial was seen as a shift away from the dollar-dominated oil trade systems and possibly laying the groundwork for wider crypto adoption within the country. Meanwhile, Strategy has announced plans to double its Bitcoin acquisition efforts. The company is planning to increase its capital allocation to about $84 billion. With more than 500,000 Bitcoins worth around $68 billion on its balance sheet, Strategy has continued to solidify its lead as the largest institutional holder of the asset. At present, the company has shown no signs of stopping, with Saylor backing its plans to acquire more units of the asset. However, the reaction to that update has been mixed, with the firm’s stock dropping by 5% on May 15 to $397, showing volatility concerns linked to its leveraging strategies. Presently, the stock is trading around $393, a drop of 0.78%, with analysts citing volatility concerns. Other nations chart their respective crypto courses Historically, global central banks have always leaned towards gold and the United States dollar as safe-haven assets that hold long-term value. However, things have started changing over the last few years. While some Bitcoin critics and nations have called the asset speculative, the precious metal has struggled over the last few days. According to recent reports, the price of the digital asset fell on Friday, dropping by more than 1%, closing in on its worst weekly decline since November 2024. Meanwhile, a growing number of countries have now added or made moves to add Bitcoin to their national treasuries. Countries like the United States, El Salvador, Iran, Bhutan , and the United Kingdom have made moves in this regard. Norway’s sovereign wealth fund also previously announced that it has increased its stake in crypto-focused firms like Strategy, Coinbase, and Metaplanet. The Saudi central bank is not the only firm expanding its footprint in the crypto sector, with UAE sovereign fund Mubadala increasing its Bitcoin holdings. According to its disclosure, the firm now has a $408 million stake in iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). This was the first time a Gulf sovereign wealth fund showcased its investment in a Bitcoin ETF. In addition to Mubadala, the UAE, through another wealth fund, ADQ, has indirectly invested in Bitcoin by partnering with Marathon Digital Holdings for a crypto mining company in the country.

The flagship cryptocurrency reached an intraday high of $104,435 on Friday but lost momentum and fell to a low of $102,720 before rebounding to its current levels. BTC is trading just 5% lower than its all-time high. However, despite its massive rally, investors and the overall markets remain relatively calm. Panama City Mayor Teases Bitcoin Reserve Panama City Mayor Mayer Mizrachi has dropped hints about a city-level Bitcoin reserve after a meeting with two of El Salvador’s top Bitcoin policy leaders. Mizrachi posted a cryptic message on X after meeting El Salvador-based Bitcoiners Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert, simply stating “ Bitcoin Reserve.” Mizrachi has not shared details about the discussions with Keiser and Herbert. However, the timing of the post is interesting, coming 11 days before the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, where Mizrachi is scheduled to speak. Plans for a potential Bitcoin reserve in Panama City come after a recently approved measure that allows individuals to use crypto for payments, including taxes, fines, and municipal fees. Mizrachi had stated at the time that Bitcoin would be accepted as payment once fiat-to-crypto rails were established. A post from Kerzier suggested the trio spoke about how Panama and El Salvador can leverage renewable energy to bolster Bitcoin mining operations. “Bitcoin is transforming Central America. El Salvador’s geothermal & Panama’s hydroelectric will power the Bitcoin revolution.” Meanwhile, Herbert noted that Panama City will integrate El Salvador’s “What is Money?” financial literacy textbook into its online library system. “Panama City to introduce El Salvador’s “What is Money” financial literacy schoolbooks to their new digital libraries. A regional Central American bitcoin block is emerging!” Chinese Textile Company Addentax Plans Bitcoin Acquisition Addentax, a Chinese textile and apparel company, has announced plans to purchase 8,000 BTC . It also plans to purchase other digital assets, including TRUMP tokens. The acquisitions will be funded by issuing shares of common stock. According to a company statement, Addentax entered discussions with an unnamed entity because their collective holdings indicate a “profound understanding and networks in the crypto world.” The company hopes the move will bring influential crypto holders as shareholders, allow it to build its network, and make crypto a long-term investment asset. Addentax joins a growing list of publicly listed companies that plan to add Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies into their respective treasuries. Many companies view the strategy as a practical way of dealing with currency depreciation and inflation. Addentax Group CEO Hong Zhida stated that the company hoped to join the likes of Strategy, Metaplanet, and other listed companies that have benefited from crypto investments. “This initiative supports the company’s broader blockchain strategy by facilitating potential acquisitions of digital assets such as Bitcoin and introducing strategic investors with experience in the crypto ecosystem. We believe that certain established digital assets may serve as a stable component of the company’s long-term holdings, given their liquidity and increasing institutional interest over recent years.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) extended its losses as it registered a marginal decline during the ongoing session. The flagship cryptocurrency has struggled to build momentum after facing multiple rejections at the $105,000 level. BTC registered an impressive rally last week that saw it surge past $100,000. However, it lost momentum after hitting a wall of resistance and fell to a low of $100,694 before rebounding. The flagship cryptocurrency has maintained its position above $100,000 despite buyer exhaustion and selling pressure, indicating that overall sentiment around the asset is still bullish. However, some analysts have warned BTC is heading for a double top, with on-chain metrics indicating waning momentum. BTC registered a marginal increase on Monday (May 5) and continued pushing higher on Tuesday, rising over 2% to cross $96,000 and settle at $96,845. Price action remained positive on Wednesday as BTC registered a marginal increase to cross $97,000 and settle at $97,005. Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as markets rallied. As a result, BTC soared over 6%, surging past $100,000 and settling at $103,093. BTC lost momentum on Friday, registering a marginal decline. However, it was back in positive territory on Saturday, rising 1.72% to cross $104,000 and settle at $104,617. Despite positive price action on Saturday, the price was back in the red on Sunday, dropping almost 1% to $103,802. Source: TradingView The price encountered volatility on Monday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Sellers ultimately gained the upper hand as BTC registered a drop of 1.04% and settled at $102,728. The price recovered on Tuesday, rising 1.36%, but was back in the red on Wednesday, dropping 0.53% and settling at $103,568. Price action was subdued on Thursday as BTC registered a marginal increase. However, it fell back on Friday, dropping 0.26% to $103,545. The current session sees BTC down nearly 1% as sellers look to drive the price to $100,000. Buyers will look to build momentum and push the price towards $105,000. A bearish MACD indicates sellers have the upper hand. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Currently priced at just $0.025, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is attracting investors seeking low-risk, high-reward opportunities in the DeFi market. Over $8.5 million has been raised in its presale, indicating strong investor confidence. The project is in phase 4 of its presale which has already sold over 80% and attracted more than 10,000 unique holders. This altcoin is shaping up to be one of the best cryptos to buy now. While Dogecoin continues to rely on viral hype, this rising star in the DeFi market is primed for explosive growth in the coming months, potentially making it the next big cryptocurrency to break out in 2025. Presale Gaining Momentum: Mutuum Finance Leads the Charge Mutuum Finance presale is far more than 80% through Phase 4, and the momentum is intensifying. Those quick on the uptake can lock in a 20% profit when the next price tier comes into play. With demand comes increased anticipation of even more dramatic profits at launch. With sound tokenomics and practical DeFi applications, MUTM is shaping up fast to be a breakout player in the 2025 altcoin conversation. Mutuum Finance carries out a unique buy-and-distribute process, unlike other many other speculation tokens. By doing this the periodic purchasing of tokens from the market and providing them to the MUTM stakers helps sustain the model and brings long term participation and thus reduces supply. This structure should increase price rise and encourage constant use from users. mtToken System Unlocks Passive Yield With Full Liquidity Mutuum Finance brings a new innovation to mtToken features, the ability to earn yield from assets outside the normal procedure of locking them. Users are not staking, they can freely use their assets and earn passively as well, which is a valuable change to DeFi users who appreciate revenue and usability. In addition, borrowers are able to easily access USDT using the platform’s collateralized loan provision, conformed to given ratio patterns. For example, $7,000 of ETH collateral can be used to unlock $5,000 stablecoins, the process being carried out via open source smart contracts. Stable, Secure, and Built to Last Mutuum Finance is building a fully collateralized, USD-backed stablecoin to be issued on the Ethereum network. Its overcollateralized design ensures long-term price stability, eschewing the collapse risks which have plagued algorithmic stablecoins. On the security front, the platform is run by open-source, third-party audited smart contracts, laying a good foundation for user trust and institutional adoption. At just $0.025 today, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself as an undervalued gem in the crypto market, potentially skyrocketing to $2.5 before Dogecoin even hits $1. Over $8.5 million has already been raised in its presale, with more than 10,000 unique investors recognizing its potential. Phase 4 is over 80% sold, and the remaining tokens are quickly becoming scarce. Those who invest now can lock in a 20% profit when Phase 5 launches and see their returns surge even further at market launch. Mutuum’s unique buy-and-distribute model and innovative mtToken system are setting the stage for long-term growth and passive yield opportunities that could drive explosive value. Don’t miss out, this is your chance to get in early on one of the top altcoins of 2025 before it’s too late. Secure your position today.

Rexas Finance (RXS), a fresh altcoin priced at just $0.20 and already turning heads as it blazes through the 12th and final stage of its presale, with over 92% sold out. While Solana’s future looks promising, Rexas Finance is capturing serious investor attention thanks to its bold vision for asset tokenization and an impressively executed presale strategy. This under-the-radar gem could outshine Solana in the long run. Solana’s Momentum: Impressive, But Is It Peaking? Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $139, continuing to prove its strength as a fast, scalable blockchain powering a wide range of decentralized applications. With its efficient architecture and growing ecosystem, it has rightfully earned its place among crypto heavyweights. However, as its market cap grows and mainstream adoption sets in, some investors are beginning to question whether Solana’s most explosive growth days are behind it. For those hunting for the next big breakout, newer projects like Rexas Finance (RXS) are starting to catch some serious attention. Rexas Finance: Tokenizing Real-World Assets Like Never Before Rexas Finance is reshaping the bigger crypto market with a dynamic platform focused on accelerating the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs). Designed for both simplicity and performance, its ecosystem empowers users to create and manage asset-backed tokens with ease. The Rexas Token Builder streamlines token creation with a no-code interface, while the Rexas Launchpad supports secure, multi-chain token offerings. Beyond these core tools, Rexas GenAI integrates artificial intelligence with NFTs to unlock enhanced digital value, and Rexas Estate offers fractional real estate ownership, delivering passive income through stablecoins. With seamless cross-chain connectivity, Rexas enables flexible participation across major blockchain networks. Presale Powerhouse: $48 Million Raised, 92% of Final Stage Sold Rexas Finance has generated significant market traction through its highly successful presale. Spanning over 12 stages, the project has raised $48 million, sold over 460 million tokens, and increased its token price from a low price of $0.03 to $0.20, delivering close to 7x gains to those who invested early. Now in its 12th and final stage, with 92% of tokens already sold, Rexas Finance continues to build momentum ahead of its upcoming exchange debut. Departing from traditional venture capital models, the project emphasizes accessibility by placing early-stage opportunities in the hands of everyday investors, cementing its position as a retail-first initiative. Global Expansion Backed by a $1 Million Giveaway Celebrating its presale success, Rexas Finance is launching a generous $1 million giveaway, awarding $50,000 to 20 winners. At the same time, the project is expanding its global presence through high-profile listings on top data tracking platforms CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, increasing visibility and sparking international investor interest. As tokenization gains momentum across financial markets, Rexas Finance stands out as a driving performance, building the infrastructure, trust, and reach needed to lead the transition into a more inclusive and decentralized investment future. Rexas Finance (RXS) is emerging as a serious performer for long-term growth, outpacing even established coins like Solana. Priced at just $0.20 and nearly sold out in its final presale stage, Rexas has already raised $48 million and is building momentum with a groundbreaking approach to asset tokenization. Unlike Solana’s growth trajectory, Rexas Finance is targeting real-world value with tools like the Rexas Token Builder, cross-chain support, and fractional real estate investment. Don’t miss out to invest in Rexas Finance today and position yourself for the future of tokenized assets.

Now, the wait is over. With its Open Mainnet live and listings on major exchanges, Pi is finally in the arena, trading freely and gaining momentum. At around $0.90, analysts believe it could revisit $0.50 for a retest before breaking toward the $2 mark. But just as Pi begins to find its market legs, another contender is already sprinting ahead. Remittix (RTX), a $0.0757 altcoin in the booming PayFi space, is redefining global payments with near-instant crypto-to-fiat transfers. It’s raised over $15 million in presale and is built on Ethereum for speed, security, and real-world use. Unlike Pi, which is still expanding its ecosystem, Remittix is laser-focused on solving a real pain point: Fast international payments with no middlemen. So while Pi charts its post-launch course, Remittix might just steal the spotlight before the next leg up and we will see why. Pi coin news just got real: $100M fund, decentralization push, and a price surge to match In a space often crowded by hype, Pi Network is quietly turning heads with substance. Born as a mobile-first blockchain that lets users mine PI on their phones, it’s now entering a new era. Just as PI coin news headlines hit with the token crossing $1.50, up 31.75% in a single day, the Pi Foundation unveiled something far more enduring: A $100 million fund to back projects building on its ecosystem. This isn’t just noise. It’s real momentum. $Pi has officially crossed $1.50 On May 14, the Pi Foundation launched Pi Network Ventures, seeded with $100 million in PI tokens and USD, aimed at high-impact startups fueling Pi’s infrastructure. The fund pulls from the 10% of tokens set aside for ecosystem development, an intentional, forward-thinking move. Simultaneously, the Foundation is preparing to release its open-source code and has already shut down its central coordinating node, a technical milestone toward true decentralization. These announcements come just days before Consensus 2025, where co-founder Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis is set to deliver a keynote that could chart Pi’s next leap. For long-time believers and new observers alike, one thing’s clear: Pi Network is no longer a speculative mobile experiment. It’s fast becoming a serious player in Web3. Why Remittix could outpace Pi Coin in the real-world payments race While Pi Network is making headlines with decentralization milestones and a $100M ecosystem fund, Remittix is quietly building something even more disruptive, especially in the world of global payments. Imagine sending money across borders in seconds, not days, without middlemen or correspondent banks. That’s what Remittix is doing, and it’s doing it with transparent fees that undercut both banks and existing payment platforms. Source: Youtube But the real reason Remittix could beat Pi isn’t just speed or savings; it’s infrastructure. The team has already secured licensing strategies and KYC/AML compliance for key fiat corridors, something many crypto projects struggle with. Its engineers have architected a hybrid system that blends on-chain transparency with off-chain fiat efficiency, giving users the best of both worlds. Behind the scenes, Remittix has assembled a heavyweight team: Developers who’ve scaled fintech apps, deployed smart contracts in the wild, and built banking integrations from scratch. With relationships in place to support 30+ fiat currencies at launch, they’re aiming for true global reach. The user experience? It’s already being shaped through a mobile-first wallet that makes onboarding intuitive, legal, and fast. While Pi is still solidifying its open economy, Remittix is laser-focused on real-world utility, and it’s moving fast. Conclusion: As Pi rises, Remittix rockets toward real-world dominance Pi Network is finally gaining traction, crossing $1.50 and launching a $100M ecosystem fund, but as it finds its footing, Remittix may be racing ahead. With over 536 million RTX tokens sold (90% of supply), Remittix is tackling real-world payments head-on with instant crypto-to-fiat transfers, compliance-ready infrastructure, and a global vision. While Pi pushes toward decentralization and growth, Remittix is already solving problems today, making it a serious contender to lead the next phase of crypto adoption.

XRP pushed past $2 late last year, only to slip back under that mark recently. For most of 2024, it hovered near $0.50, a range many traders saw as a barrier.

They point to the long stay around $0.50 and insist outside forces prevented higher gains. After XRP rallied above $2 at year‑end, talk of suppression faded—until it fell back under $2. Now critics warn that believers are setting themselves up for disappointment, while optimistic voices say judgment day will reveal the truth and clear the way for a big rally. Utility Claims Face Competition Commentators often highlight XRP’s role in cross‑border payments through RippleNet. They predict it could capture a slice of a tokenization market projected to exceed $18 trillion by 2033. But rivals are gearing up. SWIFT is rolling out faster transaction corridors, and platforms like Ethereum, Solana and Algorand are also targeting tokenized assets. So far, real‑world XRP volume remains small compared with its total supply, and widespread adoption has yet to materialize. Bold Price Targets Draw Doubt Some analysts toss around targets of $50, $100 or even $1,000 for XRP once the legal cloud clears. To reach $100, the market cap would need to expand more than 40‑times from today’s levels. A $1,000 price tag would require an even more massive inflow of new money. Few market watchers see that happening without a major institutional push or a breakthrough in cross‑border payment adoption. Related Reading: Bitcoin Outshines All In 2025, Official Report From Russian Central Bank Says Final Ruling Could Set The Stage Ripple and the SEC both say they want this case wrapped up quickly. Yet appeals courts move at their own pace. Even the most optimistic projections point to a final decision in late 2025 or early 2026. When “judgment day” arrives, it could either validate those bullish forecasts or underscore how tough it is for XRP to shake off legal overhangs. Until then, traders will likely watch every court update more closely than utility metrics. For now, it’s still a waiting game—one that could reshape XRP’s next big move.

What makes this initiative stand out is its AI-powered strategy , which is designed to identify and support promising blockchain projects and unlock new business opportunities across the crypto ecosystem. A Smarter Reserve: Powered by AI and Targeting High-Potential Projects Amber’s smart AI system scans on-chain data , developer activity, and even Crypto Twitter sentiment to spot the next big blockchain projects. The goal? To invest early in potential unicorns before they hit mainstream awareness. The reserve currently includes leading digital assets such as Bitcoin (BTC) , Ethereum (ETH) , Binance Coin (BNB) , Solana (SOL) , Ripple (XRP) , and Sui (SUI) —with plans to expand into emerging tokens and stablecoins like USD1 from World Liberty Financial . Strategic Goals Behind the $100M Reserve Amber International’s crypto reserve is built around three core goals : Early-Stage Investments : Back innovative blockchain projects using smart data and AI. Reduce Institutional Risk : Offer a safer, more stable gateway for institutional players like pension funds and asset managers to enter the crypto space. Enable Real Usage : Unlike companies that simply hold BTC, Amber plans to actively deploy funds to fuel growth in DeFi and blockchain innovations. Amber Teams Up with Hash Global to Launch BNB Fund To kick things off, Amber has invested in DeFi Development Corp. (DFDV) , a promising Solana-based project. Additionally, it has joined forces with Hash Global to launch a BNB Fund targeting institutional investors. “By introducing the BNB Fund to Amber Premium’s platform and our substantial crypto reserve, we are committed to driving the next phase of institutional client growth,” said Wayne Huo , CEO of Amber Premium. The BNB ecosystem is seeing growing demand thanks to its strong infrastructure and innovative DeFi offerings. This partnership gives investors access to BNB Chain income products, helping them earn stable returns in a volatile market. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Which Will Yield Bigger Gains: Buying Bitcoin or Bitcoin Treasury Stocks? , Building Trust: Amber’s Security-First Approach One of the biggest barriers to institutional crypto adoption has been risk—hacks, liquidity issues, and unclear regulation have kept many investors on the sidelines. Amber’s approach includes: Real-time monitoring and GPS tracking Advanced risk management systems Focus on low-volatility, high-trust assets This model aims to make institutional investors feel safe, offering them exposure to crypto without the chaos. Why This Could Fuel the Next Crypto Bull Run Institutional capital is the missing link between short-term hype and long-term growth. If Amber’s model succeeds, its $100 million crypto reserve could unlock billions in institutional investments—paving the way for the next bull run. Amber is setting a new standard for institutional-grade digital finance —one built on capital, confidence, and security. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

According to Melker, XRP’s path to becoming the “next big mover” involves more than just its recent history of rapid price action, he explained in an interview with David Lin published on May 17. Melker highlighted that XRP’s breakout was driven by several key developments, including its effective classification as “not a security,” which removed a major regulatory overhang. This legal clarity allowed the token to gain momentum in the optimism of the post-election market. Further boosting sentiment, XRP was included in spot exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) applications and the possibility of being part of the United States’ strategic digital asset stockpile, reinforcing its status as a major player in the market. However, Melker noted that for XRP to become the next major breakout asset, it needs a fresh and compelling narrative, as some minor uncertainties, such as the final settlement of financial penalties in the Ripple and Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) case , still linger. “I think we could say there was a lot of weight holding it [XRP] down, sort of like a balloon being pushed underwater, and when all of that was released, with all that clarity. They’ll need another narrative now to be the next big mover,” he said. New twist in Ripple case It’s important to remember that on May 8, both Ripple and the SEC appeared close to finalizing a $50 million settlement to end their dispute, pending court approval. However, on May 15, Judge Analisa Torres blocked the deal, stating that the motion, filed under Rule 60, required proof of “exceptional circumstances,” which were absent. The proposed settlement sought to reduce Ripple’s financial penalty by 60%, from $125 million to $50 million, while potentially allowing the SEC to shift its approach to cryptocurrency regulation. Despite ongoing legal uncertainty, XRP has traded mainly below the $3 mark, reflecting broader market sentiment. Nevertheless, Ted Pillow’s technical analysis suggested a potential breakout, as XRP recently surged above a descending resistance line, establishing a critical support level around $2.4.

However, failure to hold this level could see XRP retest the previous support zone near $2. XRP price analysis By press time, XRP was trading at $2.37, down 2.6%. Over the past week, the asset has dropped 1.4%. XRP seven-day price chart.

Mizrachi posted “Bitcoin reserve” on X after meeting with El Salvador-based Bitcoiners Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert. Keiser is also President Nayib Bukele’s Bitcoin advisor, while Herbert controls the nation’s Bitcoin Office. While he stopped short of announcing a concrete policy, his remarks strongly suggest that Panama City’s government is exploring the idea of holding Bitcoin in its treasury reserves. The move signals a growing interest among Latin American leaders in integrating Bitcoin into public financial strategies. Panama City could integrate some of El Salvador’s financial literacy books Mizrachi has yet to disclose what he discussed with Keiser and Herbert. However, his X post and that of Keiser suggest the trio discussed the possibility of a Bitcoin reserve in Panama and the asset’s future mining operations. As per Keiser’s post, it’s clear the two countries want to pursue renewable sources of energy to power BTC mining operations. Keiser wrote , “Bitcoin is transforming Central America. El Salvador’s geothermal & Panama’s hydroelectric will power the Bitcoin revolution.” Additionally, Herbert stated that Panama City will incorporate El Salvador’s “What is Money” financial literacy schoolbooks into their new digital libraries, even adding that the Central American BTC block is growing. Kaiser and Herbert helped El Salvador formulate and implement its Bitcoin policy. The country now holds 6,179 Bitcoins in its reserve, valued currently at over $640 million. Panama City has already incorporated digital assets into its payment system Mizrachi’s subtle suggestion of a BTC reserve is closely timed with the Bitcoin 2025 conference , now just 11 days away. He is expected to attend the conference in Las Vegas. If he intends to pursue a BTC reserve, he will need to work with the country’s national assembly members to draft a bill. However, so far, there’s nothing to suggest that he’s done that. Meanwhile, states like Arizona and New Hampshire in the US have already approved the establishment of state-level Bitcoin reserves. Moreover, Ukraine is close to developing its own national BTC reserve. As per recent reports, the Panama City Council has already accepted digital assets in its payments system. Residents can pay taxes, fines, permits, and municipal fees in various cryptos and stablecoins. According to the city’s officials, accepting cryptocurrencies for payments will enhance transparency in municipal financial operations and help Panama cultivate crypto adoption and innovation. The city council has even collaborated with a bank that immediately converts the received digital assets into US dollars to satisfy all legal requirements. According to Mizrachi, this process ensures compliance with existing financial regulations and enables seamless transactions for both users and the local government. Other cities like Lugano in Switzerland and Mendoza in Argentina have also implemented systems to accept crypto for tax and fee payments. The city’s council passed a proposal last month enabling its local offices to accept payments in crypto, Panama City Mayor Mayer Mizrachi said in an X post . Under the new law, locals can pay for taxes, tickets, permits, and fees with several digital assets, beginning with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the USDC and Tether (USDT) stablecoins. Still, there is no clarity on whether and when Panama City will accept other kinds of digital assets in exchange for public services. The move marks a notable shift in Panama’s evolving stance on crypto, though it hasn’t always been smooth. In 2022, President Laurentino Cortizo partially vetoed a sweeping crypto bill that sought to regulate Bitcoin and legalize decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). He returned the bill to the National Assembly for revisions, citing concerns that it needed to be aligned with Panama’s financial system regulations. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

In an interview with crypto personality Anthony Pompliano, Hayes says Bitcoin could explode by roughly between 44% and 92% from the current price. “This year, I think we get to $250,000 in Bitcoin. Maybe this summer, run to something like $150,000 to $200,000, before we get some sort of pullback.” According to Hayes, the 90-day pause on tariffs by the Trump administration, first on most countries of the world and later on China, will trigger volatility as the end of the suspension period nears. “They set these 90-day targets. Obviously, now you have a strike price, a maturity, an expiry. There’s going to be insane volatility around that. Will they or won’t they? What’s the deal going to look like? And obviously, Trump’s going to posture that he’s serious about really inflicting some pain on trade partners. So you could see sort of ‘ditch-the-bride-at-the-altar’ negotiating style… …we could see some insane volatility around July 4th for everyone except China and then China’s like August 10th, something around there. So I think now we have those dates in mind, I wouldn’t want to be overly long any risky asset…” Over the longer term, the BitMEX co-founder says Bitcoin could explode by around 860% amid a potential increase in the money supply. “I think the Trump team is very serious about trying to do their part in rectifying these [trade] imbalances. I think capital controls are the way they’re going to do it, which is a little bit slower burn. But foreigners are going to react by selling assets because now there’s a tax and they don’t want to pay it and so that’s going to require printed money to replace those dollars…. … and that money gets printed and Bitcoin benefits the most out of all the different risky assets that one could own out there. And that’s how we get to $1 million Bitcoin. I think that happens sometime between now and when Trump exits office in 2028.” Bitcoin is trading at $104,249 at time of writing.

Analysts are increasingly looking at the relationship between the leading cryptocurrency and the precious metal, and the results look very optimistic for digital asset holders. An analyst on the popular social network X, known as Apsk32, presented his ”stepped price curve” model, according to which Bitcoin’s four-year cycle should lead to a significant rise in its exchange rate this year. Golden Parallel The theory that Bitcoin follows gold to new all-time highs is quite popular among optimistic investors. Historically, the BTC/USD asset has repeated the movements of XAU/USD with a delay of several months. According to Apsk32, the implications could be particularly dramatic this time around. With gold hitting a record high of $3,500 per ounce, the future looks more than bright for Bitcoin’s price performance. ”Bitcoin’s position relative to gold has improved significantly since April,” he wrote to subscribers on X, introducing his ”stepped price curve” tool. ”It is this indicator that gives me hope for higher-than-expected returns later this year.” The ”stepped price curve” concept involves measuring the price of Bitcoin in ounces of gold to exclude the inflationary nature of the U.S. dollar. ”Here I measure the Bitcoin network value (market capitalization) in ounces of gold and fit that value to a power curve,” explained Apsk32 in a separate post in March. Among the results is a potential bull market target that patterns a move off the old 2017 high of $20,000. ”If the Bitcoin network value measured in gold continues to follow the stepped price curve, gold maintains its current value, and the Bitcoin price reaches a level again that corresponds to a five-year advance of the stepped pattern support line, we could see $444,000 as early as this year,” the analyst added. This week, Apsk32 suggested that a more ”reasonable” target for 2025 is $220,000. ”If we start getting above $250,000, I would consider that 'above expectations,'” he said when asked about the outlook. ”I do think we have a pretty good chance of reaching that level. It's just not the most likely outcome.” Half of Gold’s Future Capitalization = Bitcoin at $1 Million Continuing the gold theme, Bitcoin analyst Sam Callahan has examined data showing how high Bitcoin could go if it takes various shares of gold’s market capitalization. This could happen thanks to the shift to ”digital gold,” a process that many expect to gain momentum in the coming years. ”If gold reaches $5,000 an ounce by 2030 and Bitcoin takes 50% of its market capitalization, that would put BTC at $924,000,” Callahan noted, based on data from the latest In Gold We Trust report released this week. The report says that the data does not represent a price forecast per se, but merely gives an idea of what the value of ”hard assets” might look like by the end of the decade. Bitcoin’s correlation with gold continues to be an important factor in analyzing the cryptocurrency’s long-term prospects. Current projections point to the potential for significant growth in the coming years, with the possibility of reaching six figures as early as 2025 and approaching $1 million by the end of 2030.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-17 11:51:24

But it’s not just a collection of headlines—there’s a deeper narrative unfolding. As the crypto industry pushes for mainstream acceptance, the world is balancing innovation with enforcement, freedom with accountability, and risk with regulation. Let’s connect the dots and dive into the 3 biggest themes driving the global crypto conversation. 1. Hacks & Scams: A Wake-Up Call for Regulators and Investors The crypto market is booming—but so are the threats. This week reminded us just how high the stakes are when it comes to digital assets and user security. Coinbase Data Breach Fallout Could Reach $400M Coinbase confirmed a massive breach where hackers accessed user data with the help of insiders. A $20M ransom demand was rejected, and Coinbase launched a $20M bounty instead. With damages estimated up to $400M , the attack raised serious questions about internal security and regulatory oversight. SEC Hacker Sentenced Over Fake ETF Tweet Eric D. Council manipulated the market by hacking the SEC’s X account and posting a fake Bitcoin ETF approval. Bitcoin spiked before crashing when the truth surfaced. Council pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 14 months . South Korea Cracks Down on Crypto Fraud Rings Authorities arrested 25 people behind fake investment operations that stole over $540K. These scams mimicked legitimate crypto firms, luring everyday investors with fake dashboards and empty promises. It’s a clear sign that even advanced markets need tougher rules and better investor education. These incidents are no longer isolated. They’ve sparked pressure on global regulators to accelerate clearer, smarter rules, not just to encourage innovation but to protect users. That brings us to the next major shift. 2. Regulation & Policy: A New Era is Finally Taking Shape As hacks and scams increase, regulators are moving from confusion to clarity. This week, we saw a clear pivot from reactionary crackdowns to structured frameworks. SEC Chair Paul Atkins Unveils Reform Agenda Paul Atkins called it a “new day” for the SEC. He pledged to create rational, blockchain-specific rules for asset issuance, custody, and trading. He slammed past SEC tactics and called for smarter custody solutions, self-custody flexibility, and regulatory exemptions to keep companies in the U.S. Commissioner Divide Highlights Industry Crossroads While Atkins championed innovation, Commissioner Crenshaw urged caution, warning about misused tokenization. Commissioner Uyeda took a more optimistic stance, calling tokenization a key to market efficiency. The debate underscores how policymakers are still grappling with how far and how fast crypto should go. White House Confirms Crypto Laws Are Coming At Consensus 2025, advisor Bo Hines confirmed President Trump plans to sign key crypto bills by August, including those for stablecoins and market structure. Bipartisan talks are in motion—even if slow—indicating the U.S. may finally get its long-awaited crypto rulebook. GENIUS Act Back in Play The stablecoin-focused GENIUS Act is expected to return to the Senate after a previous stall. If passed, it could set the foundation for regulated payment stablecoins in the U.S. Brazil Tightens Stablecoin Transfers While embracing innovation, Brazil is restricting outbound stablecoin flows to foreign wallets to curb fraud and tax evasion. The move shows how countries are choosing targeted regulation instead of blanket bans. The regulatory world is catching up. The chaos from scams and breaches has forced lawmakers to prioritize crypto. And with clearer rules emerging, businesses and governments are feeling more confident about entering the space. 3. Adoption & Expansion: Institutions Are Stepping In As regulators clarify the rules, institutions aren’t waiting—they’re jumping in. This week saw a surge in national adoption, corporate Bitcoin buys, and new financial infrastructure. Brazil Leads the Way in Crypto Innovation razil became the first country to approve a spot XRP ETF, is exploring a national Bitcoin reserve strategy , and may issue Panda Bonds (Chinese yuan–denominated sovereign debt). It’s carving a path that blends innovation with financial independence. Bahrain’s Al Abraaj Group Adds Bitcoin to Treasury In a Middle East first, publicly listed Al Abraaj Restaurants Group added Bitcoin to its reserves. This move could be the domino that triggers broader adoption in the Gulf region. Ukraine to Launch Bitcoin Reserve with Binance Ukraine is close to launching Europe’s first sovereign Bitcoin reserve , partnering with Binance to stabilize its economy amid the war with Russia. Metaplanet Surpasses El Salvador in BTC Holdings Tokyo-listed Metaplanet now holds 6,796 BTC —more than El Salvador. It joins the likes of MicroStrategy in stacking Bitcoin as a long-term strategy. MicroStrategy Keeps Buying, Now Holds 568,840 BTC MicroStrategy added another 13,390 BTC in 2025, bringing its total to 568,840. Its strategy continues to influence corporate Bitcoin adoption . eToro Raises $620M Ahead of IPO eToro priced shares at $52 and raised $620M before its Nasdaq listing. The move signals investor confidence in crypto-enabled platforms. FTX to Distribute $5B in Second Payout Round FTX will begin repaying creditors on May 30 , with many expected to receive up to 120% of their original claims. The payout signals crypto’s maturing infrastructure—even in the wake of collapses. NYC Appoints Crypto Advisors Mayor Eric Adams brought in two new crypto advisors to guide the city’s public sector innovation, signaling New York’s ongoing commitment to blockchain solutions. Clearer regulations are giving institutions the confidence to make bold moves—from national Bitcoin reserves to ETFs and IPOs. Countries and companies aren’t asking if they should enter crypto. They’re asking how soon . Final Takeaway: What connects it all—hacks, regulations, and adoption—is this: crypto is growing up . The world is shifting from experimental hype to responsible innovation. The chaos of scams is being met with laws. The uncertainty around compliance is being replaced by frameworks. And the hesitation to adopt is turning into bold, calculated moves. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The growing adoption rate of the XRP Ledger Protocol could push XRP to $9.83, with a possible maximum trading value of $10.48 in 2028. In 2031, the target price for XRP is between $15.72 and $17.03, with an average price of $16.38. XRP has a strong community of supporters and developers and continues to see tremendous potential in Ripple’s technology and products. Despite short-term price fluctuations and a bear market, many analysts believe XRP has a bright future. Whether it will reach new highs or continue to grow steadily remains to be seen, but this crypto asset will undoubtedly play an important role in global financial institutions. So, how high can XRP realistically go? Will XRP reach 5 dollars? Let’s answer these questions in our XRP price prediction.

Ripple price analysis gives out a highly bearish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. The XRP/USD value has decreased to $2.368 in the past 24 hours. Concurrently, the cryptocurrency has lost up to 2.34 percent of its worth today. Technical indicators give out a bullish verdict regarding the market scenario. However, the price charts continue to showcase a bearish overview. Is XRP a good investment? XRP, a cryptocurrency specifically designed for quick and cost-effective cross-border transactions, holds promise in global finance. The easing of regulatory hurdles for Ripple and the rising adoption might boost XRP price. Additionally, several recent acquisition and CBDC development make XRP a good investment option in the long-term. As with any investment, the outlook for XRP remains uncertain, necessitating a cautious approach and thorough due diligence. Why is XRP down? The XRP/USD crypto pair price has decreased as the selling momentum was abruptly taken, devaluing the price to $2.368 during the day. The RSI decreased down to 53.92 at the same time and is present within the neutral territory. How much will XRP cost in 2025? XRP is expected to trade at an average price of $3.28 by the end of 2025. Will XRP reach $5? For XRP to reach $5, its value would need to double. Considering the current bullish trend and XRP’s price action, a surge to $5 by the middle of next year is not entirely out of the question, particularly if demand for XRP tokens continues to rise and its growth trajectory remains consistent. However, it’s crucial to remember that XRP’s all-time high stands at $3.84, achieved on January 7, 2018. Can XRP reach $20? According to Ripple’s price prediction, XRP has a lesser chance of reaching $20 by 2031. However, it is expected to reach this level if the XRP ecosystem adoption by major financial institutions continues, making it a good option to buy XRP. Will XRP reach $100 dollars? Though there are rumors of XRP reaching $100 in the market, and some pro-XRP analysts are also promoting it, many are raising questions about this possibility. XRP may not reach $100 in the near future, at least. Will XRP reach $1000? If one XRP coin is worth $1000, its market cap must be more than $100 trillion. Comparatively, the total global stock market cap is about $110 trillion. Therefore, it is unlikely that XRP will reach $1000, based on current market dynamics. Does XRP have a good long-term future? XRP is expected to increase in value gradually over the coming years, giving good yields to XRP holders and institutional investors. The coin is trading at five times its value from last year, and it is expected to reach the highest price of $17.03 by 2031. This makes it a valuable asset for multiple gains after significant market capitalization with continuous efforts by Ripple Labs. However, regulatory uncertainties still linger with the Ripple lawsuit. Considering these factors, investors must carry out their own research. Recent news/opinions on the Ripple Network ProShares has announced that it has no plans to launch an XRP ETF by May 1st. The firm clarified that any future ETFs will be based on futures contracts. Ripple’s spot XRP ETF has launched in Brazil, but the firm said that there is no ETF for US investors at the moment. Previously, ProShares was set to launch three leveraged and short XRP futures ETFs on April 30 after SEC review. Read more about it here and here .

It is important to consider that predictions are not investment advice. Professional consultation is suggested, or you can carry out your research. XRP historic price sentiment Before 2017, the asset’s value hovered around $0.01; in April 2017, it rose to $0.05; the gradual climb soon continued as it reached $0.25 in May, showing a positive price action as Ripple continued to excel. XRP price history: Coinmarketcap Towards the end of 2019, XRP price stabilized at around $0.30 and did not cross the $0.5 mark throughout the year. However, the bullish run of 2020 pushed the coin’s value to a peak price of $0.8, gaining investor interest before finishing the year at $0.66. Early 2021 was supposed to be bullish for XRP, but the SEC announced a lawsuit that derailed investors. Nonetheless, XRP beat the odds and surged above $1.5 during the year, but by 2022, it plummeted significantly to as low as $0.31. XRP started 2023 at $0.335, and on July 13, it almost doubled its value in a steep spike. It shot from $0.470 to $0.814 while swinging towards $0.9 for a few hours. A partial victory against the SEC triggered the price jump, surging the trading volume. XRP closed 2023 at about $0.62. In 2024, XRP has so far ridden the market wave. The bears earlier on and then a bullish price movement by mid-March resulted in a market price of $0.72, according to data from the cryptocurrency market. In July, XRP traded between $0.418 and $0.658, showing a good recovery. However, the coin went under bearish pressure at the start of August, falling back down to the $0.550 range as per crypto market records showing high volatility. In September 2024, XRP recovered up to the $0.642 level, but the price went down to the $0.500 range in October. A tremendous bullish impulse was observed in November when XRP touched the $1.96 mark, and it reached $2.72 on December 2, 2024. In January 2025, XRP reached a peak price of $3.19 and traded near the $2.90 level in February. It stepped down to $2.1 in March and to $1.79 in April. At the start of May, XRP is again trending near the $2.2 range.",Crypto Price Predictions|Ripple|XRP,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|XRP|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-17 12:00:00

Pi Coin ( PI ) dropped to $0.7040, down by over 57% from its highest point this week. This decline in a volume environment led to a $6 billion wipeout as the market cap moved from $11 billion to $5 billion. Pi Network has numerous risks, key among them is the continued centralization. CoinMarketCap data shows that Pi has a maximum supply of 100 billion coins and 7.15 billion in circulation. Pi differs from Bitcoin ( BTC ), whose new coins are produced through mining, which involves solving complex mathematical calculations. It also differs from proof-of-stake crypto projects like Cardano ( ADA ) and Avalanche ( AVAX ), which depend on validators. Instead, all the 100 billion Pi coins have already been pre-mined and stashed into wallets controlled by the Pi Foundation. See below. The foundation controls the 92 billion unlocked coins. Pi Foundation coins | Source: PiScan This situation presents substantial risks to the Pi Network community. For one, the membership of the so-called Pi Foundation has not been made public, and the community members’ input is not represented in it. The other risk is when a hacker or an insider accesses the Pi Foundation wallets and decides to dump the tokens. Additionally, the Pi Foundation is not subject to any audit to verify its holdings, which are estimated to be worth $70 billion. You might also like: Here’s why Pi Network price dropped after the ecosystem fund news This centralization and opaqueness mostly explain why major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase have resisted listing Pi coin, three months after the mainnet launch. Pi Network has other risks that are hurting its price. For example, millions of tokens are brought to the market each month. 1.48 billion tokens will be unlocked in the next 12 months, and billions more in the next few years. Pi Network price analysis Pi Coin price chart | Source: crypto.news The eight-hour chart shows that the Pi Coin price peaked at $1.6673 ahead of the highly anticipated ecosystem news event . It then plunged to the current $0.6980, its lowest point in over a week. Pi has moved below the key support at $0.7760, the highest swing on April 12. Moving below that support invalidated the formation of the bullish break-and-retest pattern. The coin has also moved below the 25-period moving average, while the Relative Strength Index has pointed downwards and moved below 50. Therefore, the Pi Network price will likely drop and retest support at $0.6, which coincides with the ascending trendline connecting the lowest swings since April 7. A drop below that level will point to more downside, potentially $0.40.

As the market shifts its focus toward AI-driven projects, emerging players like Unilabs are beginning to outshine older tokens such as Cardano – and even Solana. Unilabs has attracted 10k+ investors thanks to its innovative approach to asset management and strong AI integration. Analysts suggest this momentum is only just beginning, with Unilabs well-positioned to lead the next wave of growth in the crypto space. Cardano (ADA) Shows Potential to Break $1 in the Coming Weeks Cardano (ADA) has shown a strong recovery, rising 30% in the past month to a high of $0.85 before returning to around $0.78. Analysts are optimistic, with crypto strategist Ali Martinez suggesting that ADA could reach $1 if it breaks through the key resistance level at $0.81. The last time Cardano surpassed $1 was in March, driven by early excitement about a proposed U.S. crypto reserve that initially included ADA before the focus shifted to Bitcoin. Whale activity contributes to this optimism, with a significant 70 million ADA transfer recently flagged, fueling speculation that large holders are accumulating. While this indicates reduced sell pressure for Cardano, the lack of transparency raises questions about potential internal shifts. Despite these positive signs, short-term caution is advised. The RSI is nearing 60, signaling growing buying pressure and approaching overbought conditions. If ADA successfully breaks above $0.81 with substantial volume, it could continue toward $1. Failure to surpass this level may lead to a temporary pullback for Cardano. NEAR Protocol Hits Super High Speeds on Its Mainnet NEAR Protocol is revolutionizing blockchain performance with impressive upgrades. Its mainnet now achieves 600-millisecond block times and 1.2-second transaction finality. These improvements allow NEAR Protocol to rival traditional payment systems without sacrificing an ounce of decentralization. NEAR’s real-world speed and reliability now match or exceed expectations, delivering on its promises. NEAR is also upgrading its cross-chain capabilities. The recent upgrade to Chain Signatures introduces the EdDSA algorithm. The EdDSA lets users sign transactions directly on external blockchains. These developments have driven strong market performance. NEAR has gained over 40% in the past month, currently trading at $2.88, reflecting growing confidence and increasing interest in its evolving ecosystem. Unilabs Smashes Presale Records with $400k Raised in Weeks Unilabs is now one of the most successful AI presales of 2025. The fund raised over $400k in just a couple of weeks, attracting over 10k investors with its revolutionary approach to asset management. The fund’s success is rooted in its innovative approach to asset management. It combines cutting-edge AI technology with a user-centric strategy that appeals to retail and institutional investors. A key factor in Unilabs’ rapid growth is its use of AI tools like the AI Market Pulse and EASS, which eliminate human error and enable smarter, data-driven investment decisions. This has allowed the fund to identify high-potential opportunities ahead of the market. With these technologies, Unilabs has already accumulated over $30 million in assets across four funds: the AI Fund, Commodity Fund, Tech Fund, and Mining Fund. In addition to asset management, Unilabs is expanding into the DeFi space. Its DEX aggregator and Flash Loan Accelerator are live, and further tools are being developed. This positions Unilabs as a comprehensive, AI-powered investment platform for Web3 users, with a strong foundation for long-term growth. UNIL – The Heart of Unilabs UNIL is the native utility token of the Unilabs ecosystem, offering more than just access to its platform. Holding UNIL provides benefits like reduced fees, early access to new projects, and exclusive features for active participants. What distinguishes UNIL from tokens like NEAR or ADA is its revenue-sharing model. Unilabs distributes up to 30% of its revenue to token holders through a 12-tier system, rewarding early and long-term investors. Unlike speculative tokens, UNIL combines utility with passive income. If Unilabs captures just 0.2% of the asset management market, it could generate $800 million in annual revenue, with $240 million allocated for dividends. Projections show this could grow to $1 billion by 2030, making UNIL a promising long-term income source in Web3.

Many are now looking for higher-upside opportunities that align with emerging trends. Analysts believe this transition will accelerate in the coming months. AI-focused projects like Unilabs are expected to capture increasing interest – especially as XRP’s price struggles to match its past performance. Ripple Price Prediction: Analysts Say XRP’s Price Might Hit $3.4 Ripple shows signs of a V-shaped recovery as many analysts predict a potential rise to $3.40. Despite a 2% dip in the last 24 hours, XRP’s price rallied 13% over the past two weeks – showing signs of strength. The token’s surge in futures open interest supports this trend. Ripple’s OI grew from $3.61 billion to a peak of $5.53 billion and settled at $5.06 billion. This increase reflects patterns seen before XRP’s price rally to $3.40 in January 2025. Ripple’s funding rates suggest the market isn’t overheating. To maintain high momentum, XRP’s price must reclaim the $2.60 level as support. A successful retest of this level could lead to further gains for Ripple – maybe even targeting the $3.6 zone. The RSI indicates strengthening bullish momentum. $2.40 remains a critical defense level for Ripple, aligning with key moving averages and VWAPs. If XRP’s price maintains this structure, its V-shaped recovery is more likely to continue. SHIB Investors Expect a Breakout as the Crypto Market Continues to Rally SHIB is currently trading at $0.00001490, stabilising after reaching $0.00001720. Since May 9, the price has formed a descending triangle on the 4-hour chart, with lower highs against support at $0.00001460. If this support fails, SHIB could drop to $0.00001305. Trading volume is decreasing, and key indicators show weaker buyer sentiment as momentum slows down. SHIB’s RSI indicates a shift in sentiment. On the daily chart, SHIB faced resistance between $0.00001650 and $0.00001750. The memecoin is now testing a nearby demand zone. The narrowing Bollinger Bands signal an imminent move. If SHIB drops below $0.00001450, the descending triangle could break down. This could likely send SHIB towards the 200 EMA at $0.00001395. Unilabs - Reshaping the Asset Management Industry Unilabs is making waves in the $500 billion asset management industry by combining artificial intelligence with innovative financial strategies. In just two weeks, the fund has accumulated over $30 million in assets under management, drawing attention from new retail investors and experienced professionals. The fund’s success is driven by its AI-powered investment approach. Unilabs uses advanced algorithms to remove human error, relying on systems like EASS to evaluate the potential of various assets with precision. This level of data-driven analysis sets Unilabs apart from traditional investment strategies. Unilabs is also exploring the rapidly growing memecoin market. Through its Memecoin Identification Tool, Unilabs analyzes factors such as social media buzz and exchange listings to spot high-potential tokens, providing investors with exposure to high-risk, high-reward opportunities in a calculated way. Given its innovative approach and advanced AI tools, it’s no surprise that interest in Unilabs’ presale has soared. The fund’s native token, UNIL, is priced at just $0.0051, and demand continues to rise. The presale has already raised over $400,000 in just under two weeks, with both crypto whales and retail buyers eager to join in. Unilabs is quickly becoming a leading player in the space. Why is UNIL So Attractive to Investors? Unilabs’ rapid success is attracting attention to its UNIL token, partly thanks to its strong utility. The token's innovative revenue-sharing model is a major driver behind the growing interest, which sets it apart from other projects. Unilabs distributes 30% of its revenue to token holders. The payouts are distributed across twelve tiers, with larger rewards for top holders, known as “The Phoenix.” This structure encourages accumulation and strengthens the community. Analysts believe this model could significantly impact UNIL’s price. As the user base grows and visibility increases, some predict UNIL could see levels similar to XRP’s price in the coming months, especially if adoption continues at its current rate.

44732030,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-250k-2025-melker,1747483786,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png,Bitcoin to $250K in 2025 ‘totally possible’ — crypto analyst Scott Melker,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-250k-2025-melker?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"Bitcoin’s next explosive move could send the asset to $250,000 by the end of 2025, according to Scott Melker, a crypto analyst and host of The Wolf of All Streets podcast. Speaking in a recent interview , Melker cited growing institutional interest and diminishing volatility as key factors that could drive the next leg up. “250K this year, totally possible,” Melker said, adding that Bitcoin ( BTC )’s volatility has declined significantly in recent years. “It used to be about three times as volatile as the S&P. Now it’s less than two times.” He pointed to increased involvement from pension funds and ETF issuers as evidence of a more mature, stable market. The shift, he argued, reflects a broader trend of institutional adoption. “The more institutional money, the more Wall Street money, the more long-term holders get involved, the less volatility there’s going to be,” Melker explained. Related: New Bitcoin price all-time highs could occur in May Crypto markets show signs of strength in 2025 Market activity in 2025 has already shown signs of strength. Bitcoin surged past $104,000, while Ether ( ETH ) reclaimed levels above $2,600. Coinbase’s addition to the S&P 500 marked a major milestone for crypto’s integration into mainstream finance. Melker noted the company is not just entering the index but doing so in the top 50 by market cap — a reflection of how deeply rooted some crypto firms have become. In addition to Coinbase, firms like Galaxy Digital and eToro have moved forward with public listings, signaling confidence in regulatory conditions under the current US administration. Melker said that this environment, bolstered by dropped SEC lawsuits and favorable executive orders, has created what he calls “an extremely bullish” backdrop for the sector. While Bitcoin remains the primary focus, Melker acknowledged a renewed interest in altcoins. Recent price action saw Ethereum outpace Bitcoin, triggering a rally across smaller-cap tokens — a sign, he said, that “new money” is entering the space rather than just rotating within it. Related: Here is why Bitcoin price is stuck below $105K Don’t rule out a wild run Despite the optimism, Melker tempered expectations, noting that most experts are forecasting cycle highs between $120,000 and $150,000. Still, he emphasized that wild surges are not out of the ordinary in crypto. “From the 2020 lows to the last bull market, Bitcoin went from $3,000 to $69,000. A 2.5x from here wouldn’t be a big deal.” On May 16, X analytics account Apsk32 argued that Bitcoin has a “decent chance” of hitting $250,000 or more in 2025 as attention turns to gold copycat moves. Source: Apsk32 On April 28, Peter Chung, head of research at quantitative trading firm Presto, also repeated his prediction that Bitcoin will reach $210,000 by the end of 2025. On April 22, analysts from Standard Chartered and Intellectia AI said institutional Bitcoin demand from exchange-traded funds and traders seeking to hedge against macroeconomic risk could cause Bitcoin’s price to more than double this year .

Amid this uncertainty, a surprising contender is capturing the attention and wallets of major crypto influencers. FloppyPepe (FPPE) , an AI-powered meme coin with viral momentum, has received an astonishing $1.6 million in bullish bets from key figures in the space. Projecting a staggering 19,250% surge, these crypto influencers are quickly shifting their focus to this meme coin. Why Crypto Influencers Are Betting Big On FloppyPepe (FPPE) For 19,250% Gain Even though Avalanche (AVAX) and Toncoin (TON) are established tokens with a high growth record, crypto influencers are instead placing their bets on FloppyPepe (FPPE), with investments now nearing $1.6 million. But this investment isn’t just for show/views. This meme coin, after all, offers strong growth potential and unique utility that make it a truly worthwhile opportunity. FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) entire ecosystem is imbued with practical high-tech inventions that the meme coin market has never seen, adding more substance to its virality. At its core are its AI-driven user-generated content (UGC) components, like its Meme-o-Matic or FloppyX. Backed by a SolidProof audit , this MemeFi project goes beyond typical meme tokens by offering staking and a growth strategy that burns 1% of every transaction. This deflationary mechanism is designed to drive scarcity and improve long-term demand for the token. With airdrops and referral bonuses adding to its perks, crypto influencers like NASS CRYPTO are supporting a surmounting success for FloppyPepe (FPPE). At the moment, its first stage presale is rapidly coming to a close, with an impressive 93% of tokens already sold at the price of $0.0000002. Toncoin (TON) Struggles to Maintain Bullish Momentum The past few weeks have been pretty turbulent for Toncoin (TON) , which fell from its April peak of $4.15 to struggling to stay above its $3.125 weekly resistance. Despite this performance, some crypto influencers are speculating that Toncoin (TON) could rebound to $4.50 by June, with Telegram’s 950 million user base boosting adoption. Popular analyst on X (formerly Twitter), Crypto General , even shared a chart suggesting that Toncoin (TON) could surge as high as $8 if it manages to break out of the $4.5 major resistance. Although Toncoin (TON) is still grappling with a declining trading volume, the token still shows growth potential as its popular Telegram-based games continue to attract developer interest. Avalanche’s (AVAX) Heavy Price Fluctuations Sway Investors’ Trust Despite its 14% surge in the past week, a wider view of its chart shows that Avalanche (AVAX) has been fluctuating heavily. Crypto influencers are also less confident about Avalanche (AVAX), compared to other altcoins, due to its declining phase since it hit its last peak price above $50 in December. At the moment, Avalanche (AVAX) is holding in a week-to-date range of $23.69 and $25.97. On the bright side, the Avalanche9000 mainnet upgrade has slashed fees by over 90%, improving scalability and attracting projects like Pixelmon’s gaming deal. Furthermore, an X analyst has shared that Avalanche (AVAX) is showing strength and currently bouncing off a key buy wall zone. If the token breaks out above the $25.8–$27.25 sell wall, it could trigger a strong upside move. FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) Presale Is Rapidly Selling Out– Act Fast While Avalanche (AVAX) and Toncoin (TON) struggle to stay afloat, more crypto influencers, including David in Crypto , are endorsing FloppyPepe (FPPE) for major gains this year. Its intricate leverage on AI has also sparked gleaming interest among large-scale investors, with many rushing to secure as many tokens as they can in its presale. If even top crypto influencers are betting big on FloppyPepe (FPPE) , that goes to show how much growth potential the token has. Savvy investors aiming for potential gains of up to 19,250% should consider getting in early. Use the code “FLOPPY80” to unlock an exclusive 80% discount while this AI meme coin is still priced at an ultra-low $0.0000002. Act fast, because the value will not be this low again.

The studio cited the inability to secure the funds necessary to complete the game. Nyan Heroes, which recently completed its fourth game test on the Epic Games Store, also hosted the largest “play-to-earn” airdrop event on the Solana blockchain. The full version of the game was planned to be released next winter. The Overwatch-style PC game launched its first pre-alpha test in March 2024 and has reached over a million players in four rounds of testing, with over 250,000 players wishlisting the game on the Epic Games Store and Steam. Related News: Alerts Arise at the CFTC Regarding a Potential Crisis Affecting Cryptocurrencies - Caution Advised Starting May 31 However, despite this success and publisher talks, new investment searches, grant and acquisition attempts, the development team stated that they were unable to find the capital needed to complete the project. “This was not the outcome we were hoping for. The gaming industry is going through a difficult time right now and unfortunately Nyan Heroes has had to close its doors,” the statement said on social media platform X (formerly Twitter). 9 Lives Interactive CEO Max Fu said in an emailed statement that there is still hope for the game's future, but that they do not expect a concrete solution in the short term. “It's been a difficult few months. We are currently in negotiations for the transfer of the studio and/or intellectual property. However, it may take time for a decision to be finalized,” Fu said. The game’s blockchain components included the NYAN token on Solana and the Cat NFTs, which were minted in 2021. These NFTs were released long before the game was playable, but they were not required to play the game. Following the news of the game’s closure, the NYAN token took a major hit in the market. The token’s value dropped by nearly 40% during the day, dropping its market value below $1 million. *This is not investment advice.

However, Unilabs is capturing growing attention with its innovative AI-driven DeFi platform and a highly promising ICO. Analysts forecast a staggering 15,000% surge for UNIL tokens. As such, traders are re-evaluating their portfolios and shifting focus from altcoins like XRP and Polkadot toward this emerging opportunity. Unilabs: Revolutionizing DeFi Investing with AI-Driven Tools Unilabs is changing how people invest in decentralized finance by launching the first asset manager that uses artificial intelligence to help retail traders manage portfolios more effectively and increase profits. At present, the fund holds over $30 million in Assets Under Management (AUM), ensuring that users can access sufficient liquidity to swap assets or rebalance their portfolios. The protocol distributes these funds across different investment portfolios, including Bitcoin, Mining, AI, and Real-World Assets. Each of these funds gives retail investors a balanced exposure to the DeFi sector. Furthermore, Unilabs features a meme coin identification tool that helps investors find early-stage meme projects with strong growth potential by tracking liquidity, exchange listing, and trends. This tool helps users spot potential meme coin projects early to maximize potential returns. It also offers an advanced analysis tool called the AI Market Pulse. This tool scans the market for on-chain and off-chain data. This tool could help track the performance of XRP price, as well as DOT, thus giving users a clearer, data-driven view of the market. UNIL Booms as Analysts Predict Price Surge Unilabs’ ICO is gaining strong traction, raising over $425,000 so far. The presale is currently in stage 2, with over 100 million UNIL tokens sold. Investors are steadily adding more UNIL tokens to their holdings, taking advantage of the low price of $0.0051 per token. Meanwhile, analysts forecast potential gains of up to 15,000%, causing traders to shift focus from tokens like DOT and XRP to UNIL. If the forecast proves true, each UNIL token could be priced at approximately $0.77. XRP Price Gains Strength as Bullish Momentum Builds Dubai has joined forces with Crypto.com to advance crypto payment solutions in the Gulf state. With this recent development, XRP becomes Dubai’s first official regulated crypto asset, thus placing the token at the center of the new development. Moreover, with the broader market gaining momentum, the XRP price shows signs of growth. Currently trading at around $2.47, the token has seen solid gains. The XRP price has surged 11.74% in the past week and recorded further gains of 14.01% over the past month. Source: CoinCodex With growing volatility and strong technical signals, the XRP price could be headed for a major breakout. At the same time, traders are shifting focus to other emerging tokens like Unilabs , which analysts predict could see a 15,000% surge. Polkadot ETF Decisions Loom as Market Optimism Grows The SEC is expected to announce several major ETF decisions next month, with an application from 21Shares facing a June 24 deadline. Despite some regulatory setbacks from the SEC, confidence regarding a potential Polkadot ETF launch remains high. Besides, market trends around Polkadot and similar tokens suggest growing anticipation of ETF approval. Like the XRP price, analysts contend that Polkadot could surge in price if its ETF proposal gets approved. Over the past month, DOT token has gained 28.54% and is now trading at $4.78. This puts Polkadot (DOT) among the top-performing tokens in this period. Source: CoinCodex The DOT token currently has a 24-hour volume-to-market-cap ratio of 0.0834, which indicates strong liquidity. Some investors are comparing the momentum in DOT with the rise in XRP price, hinting at a similar breakout. Meanwhile, Unilabs’ presale performance has sparked interest in the crypto market, raising over $305,000 in funding. Conclusion Polkadot (DOT) and the XRP price continue to benefit from significant developments and ETF prospects, driving bullish sentiment. Yet, Unilabs stands out with its innovative AI tools, strong ICO performance, and rewarding community incentives. With the UNIL ICO trending upward and an impressive 15,000% forecast, investors are increasingly drawn to this innovative platform, making it a notable contender for significant growth in the DeFi sector.

44732853,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/05/best-crypto-to-buy-now-genius-stablecoin-bill-predicted-to-pass-soon,1747485847,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/44732853.jpeg,Best Crypto to Buy Now? Genius Stablecoin Bill Predicted to Pass Soon,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/05/best-crypto-to-buy-now-genius-stablecoin-bill-predicted-to-pass-soon,"For the first time in years, the path toward clear crypto regulation in the United States no longer looks hypothetical—it’s materializing. Momentum is building around stablecoin legislation, with bipartisan efforts inching closer to a breakthrough. The GENIUS Act, designed to regulate stablecoin issuers, is gaining traction in the Senate, bringing long-awaited clarity to a critical segment of the crypto sector. As regulatory certainty begins to replace ambiguity, the stage is being set for tokens with strong utility and stablecoin integrations to benefit. With the right projects, investors could be positioning themselves ahead of a structural shift in U.S. crypto policy. Stablecoin Bill Nears Senate Vote Momentum is returning to stablecoin regulation in Washington. The GENIUS Act—short for “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins”—may finally reach the Senate floor for a decisive vote next week. Backed by Senators Bill Hagerty and Kirsten Gillibrand, the bill aims to create the first federal framework for stablecoin issuers, giving much-needed structure to a sector vital to crypto trading. Though the bill previously passed through the Senate Banking Committee with bipartisan support, it recently stumbled during a cloture vote, mainly due to concerns from Democrats over consumer protections and potential corporate misuse. New changes to the bill now include safeguards against tech giants like Meta issuing stablecoins, while still allowing participation from private companies sparking fresh debate. The Senate needs 60 votes in Monday’s session to push the bill into formal debate . If cleared, the act could proceed toward final passage, marking a historic milestone in U.S. crypto policy. Gillibrand insists the updated draft offers “robust consumer protections” while enabling innovation—a balance that could help win over undecided lawmakers. The House is working on a separate version, and any final law will require reconciliation between the two chambers. While political friction remains—particularly surrounding Trump-linked crypto ventures—this bill has the rare potential to unify both sides around stablecoin oversight. If passed, it would pave the way for compliant stablecoin projects to gain legitimacy, possibly boosting adoption and investor confidence across the board. Best Crypto to Buy Now - Projects That May Benefit From Such Developments Solaxy Solaxy operates in a category most projects avoid—foundational infrastructure. It supports transactions on both Ethereum and Solana, not as a wrapper, but as a dedicated Layer 2 optimized for throughput, cost-efficiency, and chain-agnostic transfers. That alone gives it a technical relevance many tokens simply don’t have. If the GENIUS Act passes, creating firm standards for stablecoins, it’s not just issuers that benefit—it’s the networks that carry them. Solaxy was built for scale, and its ability to handle cross-chain movement efficiently could make it a preferred channel for regulated stablecoins once compliance becomes the norm. Solaxy has been covered by top crypto YouTubers and veterans like Austin Hilton, who also seem to be quite bullish on the project’s growth. Its native token, SOLX, powers a staking protocol that offers high APY, but the real draw is its role in transaction routing and future protocol upgrades tied to real settlement demand. As regulators set clearer rules, attention often shifts from speculative tokens to the architecture underneath. Solaxy is positioned as the latter. It doesn’t rely on hype or heavy branding. It leans into performance and speed—qualities that become more valuable once stablecoins move from loosely regulated assets to financial-grade products. The bill, if passed, could shift capital flows toward networks that can host regulated liquidity without friction. Solaxy checks that box. SUBBD SUBBD isn’t a payments protocol or a utility layer, it’s a reaction to platform control. In a creator economy that’s still heavily reliant on Web2 intermediaries, SUBBD introduces a system where creators, fans, and curators interact using smart contracts rather than centralized dashboards. Its native token, $SUBBD, functions as access, currency, and voting power. Content monetization is handled through blockchain-based licensing, tipping, and premium unlocks. With the GENIUS Act potentially defining how payment tokens operate in the U.S., systems like SUBBD that can sidestep traditional processor fees by using stablecoins might benefit directly. It’s not far-fetched to imagine a future where stablecoins become the default method of transacting between creators and fans—regulated, accepted, and recognized. If that happens, platforms already designed to accommodate such flows natively will likely get ahead. SUBBD is structured for exactly that. More than just another Web3 publishing tool, it gives creators complete ownership of distribution. From live interactions to gated content and community polls, it folds social functionality into programmable income. The bill may not be targeting creator tools specifically, but by legitimizing stablecoin-based payments, it indirectly opens a path for platforms like SUBBD to scale without friction. BTC Bull BTC Bull isn’t a stablecoin project, but its structure reflects the logic behind the GENIUS Act, which is to reduce volatility where it matters and build community strength around a core currency. BTC Bull simply provides utility by rewarding users who actively support Bitcoin through staking, voting, and holding, through airdrops and burns as Bitcoin crosses certain price milestone. It uses its native token to drive engagement in Bitcoin-focused campaigns, including content, education, and growth initiatives. If stablecoins gain a formal regulatory green light, and crypto payments inch closer to mainstream, projects that emphasize alignment with Bitcoin’s long-term value may find more legitimacy. BTC Bull capitalizes on this by functioning less like a speculative play and more like a loyalty layer tied to Bitcoin’s ethos. Its staking system encourages long-term thinking, and the voting mechanism rewards participation in ecosystem decisions. It’s meme-anchored, but structurally thoughtful. As the GENIUS Act moves closer to passage, crypto’s image in the U.S. may shift from chaotic to credible. BTC Bull has baked its identity around that transition—packaging community-driven support for Bitcoin in a model that’s both engaging and scalable. It doesn’t need to change direction if the rules shift. It’s already moving in sync with them. MIND of Pepe MIND of Pepe doesn’t behave like most meme coins—and that’s exactly the point. While others thrive on short-term virality, this project builds around a persistent AI agent that interacts with markets, monitors sentiment, and adapts in real time. It’s a self-operating persona, not just a brand. At the center is the $MIND token, which governs access to this AI’s insights and interaction loops. Instead of relying on external trendsetters, MIND of Pepe generates its own. The AI posts across social platforms, adjusts its tone based on engagement metrics, and evolves with market movements. Investors aren’t following hype—they’re watching a digital character that creates it. So how does a stablecoin bill tie into this? If the GENIUS Act reshapes how stablecoins are used, tracked, and trusted, platforms that thrive on behavioral data—especially ones plugged into social sentiment—gain sharper visibility. MIND of Pepe is built to digest these shifts, instantly factoring new regulation into its output and recommendations. This isn't a passive token—it’s part of a growing experiment in autonomous influence. And as stablecoins become more embedded in regulated finance, investor psychology will shift. People will no longer just follow noise—they’ll seek signals. MIND of Pepe was designed for that environment. It’s part memecoin, part AI lab. If the regulatory fog starts to lift, expect more investors to look toward assets that understand the crowd before the crowd realizes it’s being understood. MIND of Pepe has been built with that premise from day one. Conclusion The noise around regulation has finally started narrowing into something concrete. When rules start taking shape, the tokens best aligned with that shift often aren’t the ones chasing attention—they’re the ones already built with that future in mind. As the bill moves forward, the entries listed earlier don’t just benefit from the moment—they reflect where the market could be headed next.

SUI Shows Mixed Market Signals as Price Slips but Volume Surges SUI is navigating a mixed market session, with its price dipping slightly by 1.24% to $3.89, accompanied by a 1.25% decrease in market capitalization, which now stands at $13 billion. The unlocked market cap sits at $13.03 billion, indicating most of the supply is already in circulation. Interestingly, 24-hour trading volume has surged by 22.82%, reaching $1.56 billion, suggesting heightened activity despite the minor price correction. The fully diluted valuation (FDV) stands at a notable $38.94 billion, and the volume-to-market-cap ratio is strong at 12.01%, showing continued trader interest. With a total and maximum supply of 10 billion SUI and 3.33 billion currently circulating, SUI remains a closely watched asset amid growing speculation about its next move. Chainlink (LINK) Drops Over 5% as Price and Market Cap Decline Chainlink (LINK) is experiencing a notable decline, with its price falling 5.59% in the past 24 hours to $16.07. The market cap mirrored this drop, also down 5.59% to $10.56 billion, indicating broad bearish sentiment across the asset. Despite the price pressure, 24-hour trading volume slightly increased by 1.30%, reaching $531.92 million, suggesting ongoing interest even amid the downturn. Chainlink’s fully diluted valuation (FDV) stands at $16.07 billion, while the volume-to-market-cap ratio sits at 4.97%, reflecting moderate trading momentum. With a total supply of 1 billion LINK tokens, the current dip highlights cautious short-term sentiment as the market recalibrates.

Such altcoins allow investors to enter at lower prices and still achieve substantial returns. They offer the kind of opportunity that big-name tokens can no longer—high growth, low entry, and the potential for life-changing gains. In 2025, some of the most promising tokens are those that are quietly building momentum, solving real-world problems, and capturing the early attention of savvy investors. These under-the-radar picks are exactly where explosive growth can happen next. Below are six of the best altcoins for 2025 that could deliver massive upside. These crypto gems could be your secret to being a millionaire in 2025. Rexas Finance (RXS) Rexas Finance (RXS) is quickly gaining attention as its token launch nears. Priced at just $0.20 during its final presale, it has serious potential. While many tokens are chasing trends, Rexas is building a real-world solution with lasting value by focusing on a game-changing concept: real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. Through Rexas, traditional assets such as real estate and artwork can be converted into digital tokens. That means every day, investors can now buy fractional ownership of high-value items that were once out of reach. Rexas is removing those barriers and opening up billion-dollar markets to everyone. But Rexas isn’t just about big ideas; it has created an ecosystem that will deliver on them. The platform has several tools that are attracting investors' interest. The Token Builder lets anyone launch their token, even without technical skills. The QuickMint Bot makes it easy to deploy tokens directly from platforms like Telegram or Discord. Rexas Estate is all about fractional real estate investment, giving people the chance to trade ownership in luxury properties with just a few clicks. So far, Rexas Finance has raised over $48 million in its presale, showing investors' confidence. Early investors have already seen returns of up to 566%, and with the official launch set for June 19 at $0.25, many are expecting another significant price surge. Considering its momentum, utility, and growing community, RXS could experience a significant upward movement, pushing the token to $15 and beyond within months. Hedera (HBAR) Despite a tough 7-week downtrend, traders remain optimistic. HBAR’s Bollinger Bands are tightening. This signals a big move soon, and with candles below the baseline, the odds lean bullish. Funding rates are also favorable, meaning more traders are betting on price increases than declines. If HBAR breaks past the $0.177 resistance and holds it, the next target is $0.197, with $0.2 in sight. While risks remain if it drops below $0.154, the setup looks promising. HBAR could surprise everyone as one of the best low-priced altcoins this year. Pepe Coin (PEPE) PEPE is quietly setting the stage for a significant breakout. Priced well under $0.50, this meme coin is forming bullish chart patterns, including the double and triple bottom, as well as a falling wedge. These are all classic signs of a coming rally. A top analyst predicts PEPE will double in value soon, potentially pushing its market capitalization past $6 billion. Recent wallet buys and technical signals, such as the PPO and RSI, also suggest that momentum is building. If it clears resistance around $0.0000076, short liquidations could fuel a sharp spike. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin is back in the spotlight, and it’s not just hype. With the launch of the first-ever Dogecoin ETP by 21Shares on the Swiss Exchange, DOGE is entering the world of traditional finance. Now, investors can buy exposure to Dogecoin just like a stock—no crypto wallet needed. Backed by real DOGE, this move adds trust and makes it more accessible. Additionally, whales are quietly accumulating millions of DOGE. Analysts are also watching as DOGE breaks out of key patterns. Flare (FLR) Flare just jumped over 5.9% in a week, riding on the hype of the upcoming Flare 2.0 upgrade. Flare 2.0 could completely transform how blockchains interact, thanks to its new Protocol-Managed Wallets. Traders are already piling in, pushing volume and market cap higher. With technical charts flashing bullish signals and momentum building, FLR might finally break out of its long downtrend. Tron (TRX) Justin Sun confirmed the buzz around a spot Tron ETF with staking rewards. This makes TRX the first crypto with a proposed ETF offering a 4.5% annual yield. This application represents a significant step, particularly given that no staking-feature ETF has been approved yet. Tron just flipped Cardano in market cap and is up over 120% in the past year. With growing interest from investors and strong momentum, TRX could easily become a breakout gem this year. Conclusion The token smart plays in 2025 are those that offer low price points with room to run. Rexas Finance stands out as a clear front-runner under $0.50. Its RWA tokenization model and presale success are already attracting millions in investment. Pair that with rising players like HBAR, PEPE, DOGE, FLR, and TRX, and you’ve got a list of altcoins ready to shake up the market. Hence, these six tokens might just be your best shot at turning a small investment into something substantial.

44733655,https://invezz.com/?p=2722022,1747486200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"Still hunting for the best cheap crypto? MUTM stands out on price, momentum",https://invezz.com/news/2025/05/17/still-hunting-for-the-best-cheap-crypto-mutm-stands-out-on-price-momentum/,"Crypto markets tend to reward those who move early — especially when the token in question is both underpriced and built on real foundations. This is precisely why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is drawing attention from investors searching for the best cheap crypto to buy now ahead of its next potential breakout. At just $0.025, with its fourth presale phase nearing full capacity, MUTM checks all the right boxes for those looking for value, momentum, and long-term upside in one place. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum’s presale is divided into 11 planned phases, with the current Phase 4 already more than 80% filled. As soon as it closes, the token price will increase to $0.03. This upcoming price jump is driving a wave of early buyers eager to secure their position before the cost increases. In a presale world flooded with speculation, what’s setting MUTM apart is its pace. Capital is entering consistently, the community is nearing 10,000 holders, and over $8.2 million has already been raised — all while the protocol remains relatively under the radar. For committed investors, this is often seen as an ideal moment to get in. What’s turning heads is that MUTM isn’t just cheap — it’s designed for function and growth. The platform itself is built around decentralized lending and borrowing. Users will be able to access liquidity without selling their crypto, borrowing against their holdings instead. This model serves two purposes: It gives long-term holders flexibility without liquidation. It creates passive income opportunities for liquidity providers. It’s a framework with real-world application, and it means that token demand will grow in proportion to how the platform is used — not just how much it’s talked about. As borrowing activity picks up, part of the revenue generated is used to buy back MUTM tokens from the open market. These tokens are then redistributed to active participants, creating a steady feedback loop where utility drives value. This kind of treasury model helps support the price of the token long-term. It’s why many analysts are now including MUTM in their lists of the next big crypto projects with true staying power. Another reason investors are rallying around MUTM is its execution strategy. Rather than releasing the token and delaying features, Mutuum Finance is set to launch a beta version of the platform at the time of listing. That means core lending and borrowing functions will be accessible immediately — giving utility to the token from day one. This launch-ready approach isn’t common in presale projects, which often go live with nothing more than a roadmap. For those prioritizing utility in their crypto investment, this is a meaningful difference. When users deposit assets into the protocol, they’ll receive mtTokens — digital representations of their share in the liquidity pool. These tokens accrue value automatically, growing as interest is paid into the system. It’s another way the protocol rewards active participation. Holders of mtTokens are also eligible for additional MUTM distributions through the platform’s revenue loop, further increasing their long-term earning potential. MUTM’s current entry point of $0.025 adds to its appeal — though this price won’t remain available for long. As the token moves through the remaining presale phases, and especially once it hits the open market, investors expect the value to rise sharply. Unlike many low-cost tokens that depend on hype, MUTM is gaining traction based on its structure, development progress, and capital inflow. That’s why it’s being called one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy now by analysts watching early-stage projects. If you’re still asking what crypto to invest in while prices remain favorable, Mutuum Finance deserves serious consideration. It’s under $0.03, has clear utility, and is already backed by a growing community — with full platform access planned from launch and a CertiK audit underway to ensure code security. MUTM has yet to experience a major surge — and that’s exactly what makes it compelling right now. For smart capital, this isn’t a wait-and-see moment. It’s a buy-before-it-breaks-out opportunity.

44733333,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=729827,1747486202,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/44733333.jpeg,Trump meme coin contest winners raked in hundreds of millions of dollars in profits,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trump-meme-coin-contest-winners/,"Hundreds of wallets raced to stack Trump’s meme coin for a chance to have dinner with him, but most of them didn’t stay loyal to the token for long. After the contest deadline closed on May 12, wallet activity showed that many top holders who secured VIP seats at the event dumped their $TRUMP coins almost immediately. The contest, which launched on April 23, offered a private gala dinner with President Donald Trump at his golf club in Virginia for the top 25 wallets holding the most $TRUMP. The coin’s price jumped from $9.26 to $15.33 after the announcement. According to Financial Times, 16 of the 25 wallets labeled as VIP winners have completely emptied their holdings, despite the contest page urging people to “Hold Big. Hold Strong. Hold $TRUMP.” These wallets were rewarded with access to a May 22 gala dinner, a special reception with the president, and a private tour. But for most, that seemed to be the end of their relationship with the coin. Traders cashed out after locking dinner invites FT’s analysis showed that 22 out of the 25 top wallets didn’t exist on-chain until after the contest began. Five of those wallets made moves that imply they cashed out immediately once their dinner slots were confirmed. One of the biggest players was a wallet labeled “Woo”, which transferred 1 million tokens just days before the window closed. Those tokens were worth $10.8 million at entry and $13.3 million at exit, giving Woo a possible profit of $2.6 million. Another trader, operating under the name “NACH”, is estimated to have made around $52,000 by flipping their stash shortly after the deadline. Meanwhile, someone using the wallet “GAnt” may have dropped close to $1 million just to earn their seat — with no obvious sign of making it back through token sales. Three wallets — including one tagged “ogle” — had already been holding $TRUMP before the contest launched. Ogle is estimated to have walked away with $4 million in profits, but all from trades before the contest window opened. Another account, called “SUN”, is in a very different spot. SUN bought roughly 1 million tokens, including a massive buy of 800,000 coins at $61.13 each, well above the current trading price of $12.96. Based on current values, that wallet is now sitting on a potential $66 million loss. Justin Sun speculated to be behind massive losing wallet The SUN wallet’s name, timing, and activity have led many in the crypto community to believe it belongs to Justin Sun, the Chinese crypto investor. The wallet is connected to HTX, where Justin serves as an adviser, and he also recently invested $75 million into World Liberty Financial , a Trump-linked crypto company that isn’t directly tied to the memecoin contest. When asked about the wallet, Justin told the FT he had no comment. Even though SUN is underwater, it still landed one of four custom watches given to the largest token holders during the competition. That giveaway was separate from the dinner invites and was based purely on wallet balances during the contest period. It’s unclear if the watch makes up for the loss, but the address still ranks among the top holders in raw volume. Beyond the 25 VIPs, another 195 participants earned a general admission ticket to the dinner. But just like the VIPs, many of them moved on from the token once the snapshot was taken. FT’s data shows 56 of those 195 wallets were emptied out after the contest closed. Wallets that won labeled themselves with nicknames on the coin’s official website, but none of the owners are publicly identified. There’s no verification system, and no direct links to real names have been confirmed, except in speculation around Justin Sun’s possible involvement. What’s clear is that most contestants saw this whole setup as a chance to flip the token for a profit. They got in, they held just long enough, and once their invitation was locked, they got out — fast. The memecoin’s purpose was short-lived, and for a few wallets, very profitable.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) price dropped from this week’s high of $105,000 to $103,000. Some of the top laggards were Pi Network ( PI ), Bonk ( BONK ), Floki ( FLOKI ), and Pudgy Penguins ( PENGU ), which dropped by over 10%. Top laggards in the crypto market | Source: CMC Bitcoin is often the main driver in the crypto market. In most cases, altcoins rally whenever the top coin is on an upward trend and fall when there’s a retreat. For example, most of them surged by double digits recently when Bitcoin broke the resistance at $90,000 and reached $105,900. In this case, altcoins are falling because Bitcoin has failed to cross the resistance at $105,000 and retest its all-time high. Crypto prices are also crashing because of profit-taking among investors who benefited from the recent surge. Indeed, some of the top gainers during the rally have become the top laggards. For example, Bonk, which dropped 26% from its monthly low, was up almost 200% from its lowest level in April. Similarly, Floki was up 162%, while PENGU was up over 330%. It is common for cryptocurrency prices to retreat after a strong rally. The crypto market is also falling because of the overall market risks. While the US reached a truce with China, it maintained a 30% tariff. Officials also maintained the baseline 10% tariff on most goods from the UK, and talks with Japan have stalled. As such, there is a risk of a recession in the US, with Polymarket traders bringing the odds to 38%. Meanwhile, Moody’s, one of the top three rating agencies, downgraded the U.S. on Friday after the market closed. It cited the country’s large public debt and Washington politicians’ deteriorating fiscal policies. You might also like: Pi Network price crashes as centralization risks persist Will the crypto market go back up The best way to predict whether crypto prices will bounce back is to look at Bitcoin. On the daily chart, there are signs that it is slowly forming the bullish pennant pattern, comprising a vertical line and a triangle pattern. Bitcoin is also forming a cup-and-handle pattern , a popular bullish continuation sign. It also remains above the 50-day moving average. Therefore, it may bounce back and hit its all-time high of $109,300. Moving above that level will point to more gains in this cycle, leading to a strong rebound of most altcoins.

After surging toward the $1.50 mark earlier this month, Pi Coin price action has sharply reversed, falling into a critical support zone near $0.65. This region coincides with a rising trendline visible on the 4-hour chart, and its defense will likely determine Pi’s near-term trajectory. What’s Happening with Pi Coin’s Price? Pi Network price dynamics (Source: TradingView) On the 4-hour chart, the Pi Coin price appears to have broken below multiple short-term support levels, including the $0.85 and $0.75 zones, before stabilizing near $0.65. This support area is derived from a long-standing ascending base that began forming in late April. The current bounce attempt is modest, but buyers are trying to reclaim lost ground after five consecutive bearish candles.

While much of the crypto space chases short-term spikes and uncertain launches, BlockDAG is rolling out a strategy that feels focused, confident, and built for long-term value. The upcoming GO LIVE Reveal is not a teaser. It is a structural update backed by progress. Five major exchanges are already confirmed, including MEXC, BitMart, CoinStore, XT.com, and LBANK. Another 15 listings will be announced on June 13. Until then, the presale price is locked at $0.0020, offering a rare fixed entry. In a market that rewards timing and momentum, BlockDAG is not waiting for post-launch hype. It is building clarity and access in advance. That level of execution is why many are already naming it the best crypto for 2025. GO LIVE Reveal Is More Than a Preview, It’s a Statement BlockDAG is not playing the presale game quietly. While most projects hint at listings, BlockDAG has confirmed five major exchanges upfront. MEXC, LBank, CoinStore, XT.com, and BitMart are not placeholders, they are real partners with active trading volume and global access. More US-based platforms are also in the mix, but those names will be held until launch. The real shift happens on June 13. That is when the full list of 20 exchanges goes public. This kind of early transparency sends a message. BlockDAG is not waiting for hype after launch, it is building structure and liquidity ahead of time. That level of preparation is rare, and it positions the project as a serious contender for 2025’s top crypto spot. The $0.0020 Price Lock Is All About Timing the Entry BlockDAG is giving buyers something most presales never offer: time. The price has been frozen at $0.0020 during Batch 28 and will remain fixed until June 13. This is not just about holding the rate, it is about giving serious participants room to position with full visibility before the next price climb begins. With 16 batches remaining, early buyers have already seen over 2,520% gains from previous tiers. But the window is still open. Once the GO LIVE Reveal hits, and listing access is fully disclosed, pricing moves back into motion. Right now, this freeze is not just a discount, it is a rare advantage in a space driven by late entries and fast exits. BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles and Referrals Keep the Presale Surging BlockDAG has turned its presale into a daily event with real stakes. The Buyer Battles system allocates 150 million BDAG coins every 24 hours, rewarding the top buyer of that day with any unsold coins. Each day, the leaderboard resets and new names climb to the top. It is turning participation into competition and creating a network effect that builds visibility into loyalty. Combine that with a 25% referral bonus and an extra 5% for every new user, and the result is consistent, high-volume activity. This is not just marketing for clicks. It is structured user acquisition that is working. BlockDAG has already raised over $253 million and sold more than 20.6 billion coins, all before hitting a single exchange. These are numbers usually seen after launch, not before. This level of traction is one reason analysts are calling BDAG a top contender for best crypto of 2025. BlockDAG Is Not a Pitch, It’s a Live Network in Motion BlockDAG is not just a whitepaper. The testnet is already running and processing over 800 transactions per second. More than 1 million people are using the X1 mobile miner , and shipment for the X10, X30, and X100 miners is starting soon, with delivery videos coming. The fundamentals are locked in. CertiK and Halborn audits are complete, and the hybrid DAG plus Proof-of-Work architecture brings both speed and security to the table. This is infrastructure built with long-term scalability in mind, not just hype cycles. Brand partnerships are also gaining steam. BlockDAG has confirmed a collaboration with Inter Milan, adding cultural reach to its technical base. This is a project that is already delivering across all fronts, and that is why many are calling it the best crypto for 2025, well before the coin even lists. What The Future Holds BlockDAG has achieved what most projects only aim for. It has taken the uncertainty of presales and replaced it with structure, proof, and clear execution. The GO LIVE Reveal is just one milestone in a rollout already packed with confirmed listings, a fixed entry price, and measurable traction. As June 13 draws near, the chance to enter with full clarity and capped pricing is narrowing. This is not about hype, it is about results. BlockDAG is being named the best crypto for 2025 not because of promises, but because of everything it has already delivered. The market is watching, and it is taking notice.

LINK Rallies & SUI Eyes Breakout,https://thecoinrise.com/web3-ai-near-4-5m-in-presale-funding-link-rallies-sui-eyes-breakout/,"Crypto markets are showing signs of renewed strength as several major names push forward with notable price actions. Chainlink is seeing clear bullish behaviour as key metrics support continued upside. Meanwhile, Sui has shaped a chart setup that analysts believe could break higher if the current pattern sees follow-through volume. These shifts are attracting attention across the trading space. Although LINK and SUI are gaining momentum based on price, Web3 ai is pulling funds for a different reason. With almost $4.5 million raised during presale and working AI-based tools going live with the token release, early supporters are calling it the best crypto to invest in now due to its practical utility and strong project base. Chainlink (LINK) Rally Strengthened by Exchange Withdrawals LINK’s recent upward push is gaining speed as data shows 3.3 million tokens being pulled from major centralised exchanges. Such a drop in exchange balances typically indicates growing long-term holding behaviour, which many view as a positive sign for price. LINK has broken above its previous sideways range and formed a bullish pennant, which traders often interpret as a signal for further gains. Price charts suggest LINK may climb higher if it holds key support. Current readings from momentum tools reflect rising demand and stable higher lows, and forecasts from market watchers suggest a potential 150% move in the near term. This aligns with a wider market trend favouring tokens with practical value. Chainlink remains a leader in decentralised oracle tech, offering essential data feeds to major DeFi projects. This utility helps reinforce confidence in its role going forward. With both solid fundamentals and strong price structure, LINK is widely being named among the best cryptos to invest in now. Sui (SUI) Readies for a Breakout with Bullish Chart Formations Sui is gaining traction due to chart signals forming around a potential breakout. It recently confirmed an inverse head and shoulders pattern, often seen as a trend reversal setup. After rebounding from $3.80 and crossing a key neckline near $3.93, the next targets are around $4.20 and $4.65, pending volume confirmation. Support for Sui’s move isn’t limited to technicals. The project has recently seen a pickup in institutional focus, with notable volume surges on major exchanges. As more capital flows toward smart contract platforms with strong development plans, Sui is increasingly seen as a front-runner. Other on-chain signs are also positive, including wallet growth and higher total value locked. With staking programs gaining use and more developers coming on board, Sui is building momentum. For traders following technical patterns and those focused on utility-driven growth, Sui continues to hold a spot as one of the best cryptos to invest in now. Web3 ai Nears $4.5M Mark Backed by Utility and 1747% ROI Potential While LINK and SUI attract attention for their chart setups, Web3 ai is drawing focus for its presale growth and working features. The project is nearing $4.5 million in presale funding, as more users look to benefit from its AI-powered crypto tools. Entering stage 5, Web3 ai is priced at $0.000365, while the last stage price is set at $0.003267 and listing at $0.005242, offering a projected return of 1747%. One core feature of Web3 ai is its DeFi Yield Farming Advisor, which will be available at launch. This tool delivers real-time analysis for yield farming platforms like Aave, Curve, and PancakeSwap. It reviews APR levels, checks contract safety, and recommends actions based on TVL and price movement, also offering auto-compounding functions to help users grow returns more efficiently. Another major highlight is the AI Crypto Trading Bot, designed to run on both centralised and decentralised exchanges. Using adaptive learning methods, the bot fine-tunes strategies based on trading behaviour, volumes, and trends. Users can adjust strategies, perform backtests, and control risk using built-in tools. Unlike many presales that delay functionality, Web3 ai will offer these tools from launch. Features will integrate directly with the $WAI coin, adding practical use from day one. With early-stage access, useful products, and low-cost entry, Web3 ai is becoming widely viewed as the best crypto to invest in now for those focused on actual use and steady exposure. Final Thoughts! Strong token outflows and favourable chart signals are backing Chainlink’s breakout. This LINK rally has the support of its tech role across DeFi, pushing it into top analyst picks. At the same time, Sui continues to build toward a technical breakout, with growing adoption and bullish setups putting it under the spotlight. Meanwhile, Web3 ai stands out for offering working tools, nearing $4.5 million in presale traction, and a 1747% ROI margin. While LINK and SUI show strength on charts, Web3 ai combines actual features with a pricing advantage. For anyone considering the best crypto to invest in now , Web3 ai remains a front-runner.

Specifically, these coins were transferred to exchanges, which indicates that XRP is at risk of a massive sell-off. Over $40 Billion XRP Moved To Exchanges CryptoQuant data shows that over $40 billion has been moved to Binance this past week, with the exchange’s reserves surging during this period. This development is usually bearish as it indicates that investors are looking to offload their coins. This comes as the XRP price surged to as high as $2.6, which explains this wave of profit-taking. Related Reading: XRP Reaching Oversold Levels As Net Flows Turn Negative, What’s Next? Moreover, crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed that Bitcoin whales have secured profits, selling over 30,000 BTC this week. As such, XRP whales may be simply mirroring this move. Meanwhile, Bitcoinist reported that XRP is reaching oversold levels as net flows turn negative, with the wave of sell-offs heightening. This selling pressure comes amid Judge Analisa Torres’ ruling in the Ripple SEC lawsuit, which provides a setback for XRP. The judge denied the parties’ motion for an indicative ruling because the filing was procedurally improper. The ruling also sparked a massive sell-off, with XRP dropping over 4%. XRP risks losing its bullish setup as Martinez revealed that the key support zone is at $2.38, meaning that a drop below this level could lead to a deeper correction. However, a hold above this level could set the altcoin for a rally to new highs as the analyst revealed that there are no major resistance clusters ahead. Crypto analyst CasiTrades had warned that XRP’s failure to hold above the $2.69 resistance could send its price towards $2.30 for a reset. Altcoin Has Formed A Double Bottom Formation In an X post, crypto analyst Egrag Crypto revealed that XRP has formed a double bottom following the dip to $2.3126. He stated that the altcoin is still bouncing off the red descending trend line, showing resilience. The analyst added that the altcoin is experiencing some micro noise within the range between the Fibonacci 0.888 levels at $2.30 and $2.62. Related Reading: XRP Price Set To Continue Uptrend As Stochastic RSI Moves Out Of Oversold Zone His accompanying chart showed that the key is for the XRP price to hold above the trendline at $2.3. A bounce from this level could send the altcoin as high as $3.8, near its current all-time high (ATH) of $3.84. Based on its historical performance, Egrag Crypto still expects the altcoin’s price to rally to between $27 and $33 in this market cycle. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.37, down almost 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

The son of former U.S. President Donald Trump declared that *“everyone is trying to accumulate Bitcoin right now”—*from sovereign wealth funds to billion-dollar family offices. Trump, who co-founded American Bitcoin (now merged with Gryphon Digital Mining), spoke alongside Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot, describing what he sees as two races currently underway in crypto: one for mining capacity and another for accumulation—led, he says, by MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor. “I’m on planes, I’m traveling, and I hear it from sovereign funds, the richest families, the biggest companies—everyone wants Bitcoin,” Trump told attendees. His public endorsement of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, particularly at a time when institutions are returning en masse to crypto, has added fuel to the bullish case for BTC. It also highlights a shifting political tide, with the Trump administration broadly perceived as more crypto-friendly than its predecessor. DDC’s Surprise Bitcoin Bet Shocks Markets In another boost for Bitcoin, Chinese affiliated brand DayDayCook (DDC) revealed it bought 100 BTC for $10.4 million and plans to buy 5,000 more over three years. CEO Norma Chu made the announcement in a May 15 letter after a strong earnings report showing 33% revenue growth in 2024.

DDC’s BTC purchase: $10.4 million Goal: Accumulate 5,000 BTC over 36 months Operating region: Hong Kong/Mainland China 2024 revenue growth: 33% This is big news not just because of China’s anti-crypto stance but also because it shows Bitcoin is becoming a treasury asset even in uncertain regulatory environments. The news pushed BTC up 2.3% this week as institutional interest is growing regardless of jurisdiction. Galaxy’s Tokenization Push Reinforces Crypto Credibility Institutional credibility got another boost with Galaxy Digital’s Nasdaq debut at $23.50 per share. Despite a Q1 2025 net loss of $295 million, the company announced it will tokenize its shares, ETFs and bonds with the SEC. CEO Mike Novogratz called the process “unfair and infuriating” but is committed to decentralizing finance. Galaxy has $7 billion in assets and will bring tokenized equities to DeFi platforms – potentially a new class of investors. @galaxyhq is serving the digital asset ecosystem end-to-end and developing infrastructure to power an AI-enabled future.

Technical Outlook: Bitcoin Coils Ahead of Breakout On the 1-hour chart, BTC is forming a symmetrical triangle between $104,550 and $102,659, keeping Bitcoin price prediction neutral. This is a setup for volatility. MACD is slightly bearish but the pattern of higher lows shows bulls aren’t backing down. Bitcoin price chart – Source: Tradingview Trade setup: Long above $104,550 Short below $102,659 Stop-loss inside the triangle Bitcoin is coiling – waiting for its next catalyst. Whether it’s macro support or institutional momentum the case for $105K and beyond is building. BTC Bull Token Nears $6.84M Cap as 71% Staking Yield Drives Demand As Bitcoin stabilizes above $102K, investor focus is shifting toward yield-generating altcoins—none more so than BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The token has now raised $5.87 million out of its $6.84 million presale goal, with a price increase looming as it enters its final funding stretch. What sets BTCBULL apart is its flexible staking model, offering an estimated 71% annual yield with no lockups or withdrawal penalties. This approach gives investors the freedom to earn passive income while maintaining full liquidity—an attractive alternative to traditional DeFi staking protocols. Key Stats: USDT Raised: $5,878,513.14 / $6,844,387 Token Price: $0.002515 Staking Pool: 1.47B BTCBULL Yield: 71% APY BTCBULL merges the viral appeal of meme tokens with the real-world utility of DeFi, making it a standout pick for those looking to capitalize on the 2025 crypto cycle. With under $1 million left before the next price tier, entry at current levels is limited—fueling urgency among retail investors seeking early access to passive yield.

His cryptic hint came right after a high-profile meeting with El Salvador’s leading crypto strategists . A Cryptic Clue Sparks Excitement Mayor Mizrachi posted the words “Bitcoin Reserve” on X shortly after meeting with El Salvador’s Bitcoin policy leaders, Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert. The post, just 11 days ahead of his scheduled speech at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas, has stirred speculation across the crypto community. While no official details have been disclosed, the timing and tone hint at major developments—perhaps even Panama City mirroring El Salvador’s national Bitcoin reserve, which now holds 6,179 BTC worth nearly $640 million. Crypto Payments Pave the Way Panama City is already moving toward crypto adoption. A recently approved measure may soon allow Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether (USDT), and USDC to be used for public payments—including taxes and municipal fees—pending the implementation of crypto-to-fiat conversion systems. Although establishing a city-level reserve is possible, a federal-level Bitcoin reserve would require legislation by the National Assembly, which Mizrachi has not yet formally initiated. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Which Will Yield Bigger Gains: Buying Bitcoin or Bitcoin Treasury Stocks? , Sustainable Bitcoin Mining & Crypto Education Ahead As per Max Keiser’s post , they discussed using Panama’s hydroelectric energy for sustainable Bitcoin mining—similar to how El Salvador leverages geothermal power. This could help Panama position itself as a green crypto-mining hub. In a notable educational initiative, Herbert confirmed that Panama City will adopt El Salvador’s “What is Money?” financial literacy textbook in its online library—marking a deeper collaboration between the two nations. Conclusion Mayor Mizrachi appears bullish on the idea of a Bitcoin reserve, but more clarity is expected once he consults with national lawmakers. With El Salvador recently facing IMF tensions over its Bitcoin policy, Panama may tread cautiously.However, with the Bitcoin 2025 Conference just around the corner and Mizrachi set to speak, the crypto world is watching closely .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Pi Coin Price Crash Raises Concerns,https://coinpedia.org/news/is-pi-network-dead-pi-coin-price-crash-raises-concerns/,"The post Is Pi Network Dead? Pi Coin Price Crash Raises Concerns appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Pi Network community is in shock as Pi Coin plunged over 20% in the last 24 hours, falling from its recent high of $1.60 to just $0.7017. This sharp decline comes right after the Consensus 2025 hype, where the Pi Core Team promised a thriving ecosystem and full Mainnet launch. But a top Pi analyst, known as Dr Altcoin , is raising serious concerns about what’s happening behind the scenes—and what it means for millions of Pi users. Pi Network Core Team No Longer Needs the Pioneers? According to Dr Altcoin, the Pi Core Team’s latest moves suggest they may no longer need the community that helped build the network. He points out: In March, the Core Team asked Pioneers to promote the project. They claimed it took 6 years to make Pi Network “ready to use.” But now that they have funding through Pi Network Ventures , Dr Altcoin believes the community is being sidelined. In fact, he notes that recent updates from the Core Team have completely stopped using the word “Pioneers.” Pi Was Pre-Mined – And That Changes Everything One of the most controversial claims is that all Pi Coins were pre-mined , meaning the Core Team holds a large portion of the total supply. This contradicts the belief that users were mining Pi over time. Dr Altcoin warns this gives the team full control over supply and price , creating a centralized risk in what was supposed to be a decentralized project. Hidden Sell-Off? 12 Million Pi Moved Dr Altcoin claims that during the Consensus 2025 hype, the Core Team sold approximately 12 million Pi Coins . He even calls it a “rug pull” in plain sight while users were distracted by talk of DApps and Mainnet updates. However, some users in the community argue there’s no on-chain proof of the Core Team selling any tokens. They suggest these were routine transfers to pioneer wallets, not evidence of a sell-off. KYC Automation Raises Privacy Concerns The analyst also raises concerns over the new automated KYC process , which he says may compromise user data privacy and weaken verification standards. With less oversight, he warns the system may become more vulnerable to misuse. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Coinpedia Digest :Top Crypto News This Week-Hacks, Regulations, and Institutional Adoption , Analyst Predicts Pi May Drop to $0.40 Dr Altcoin believes the price could fall further and advises users to wait until it drops to around $0.40 for a better entry point. He’s demanding that the Core Team offer a public explanation for the recent crash . Will Pi Coin Recover? Another Analyst Thinks So Not everyone agrees with the bearish outlook. Crypto analyst Mr Spock believes this is just a temporary dip caused by FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt). He points to Pi’s strong community and growing utility, saying: “Pi Network is still valuable. Don’t fall for the panic.” He warns that short sellers may be spreading false narratives to scare new investors, especially since many Pi holders are new to crypto . .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

44733509,https://coinpedia.org/?p=457073,1747487377,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,Ripple News: Why XRP Is Winning Institutional Trust?,https://coinpedia.org/news/ripple-news-why-xrp-is-winning-institutional-trust/,"The post Ripple News: Why XRP Is Winning Institutional Trust? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A recent breakdown by crypto analyst All Things XRP has reignited attention around XRP’s standout feature—ultra-low transaction fees and lightning-fast speeds, even during peak demand. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, XRP isn’t built for mining profits but for efficient, high-volume money movement —exactly what global institutions need. Let’s dive into why XRP’s transaction model is setting it apart in 2025. XRP Transactions Cost Less Than a Fraction of a Cent In a post that’s gaining traction on X , the analyst reveals that each XRP transaction costs just $0.00002 —a fee that remains flat, regardless of network congestion or speed requirements. This means no gas wars, no surge pricing, and no need to overpay to get faster confirmation. Even if XRP hit $1,000, the fee would still be a negligible 0.00001 XRP—making it one of the most stable-fee networks in crypto. No Mining, No Validator Rewards: The XRP Difference Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, where miners and validators demand rewards, XRP doesn’t rely on financial incentives to process transactions. It uses a consensus protocol that eliminates the need to pay for security. This model keeps fees low and removes the financial pressure that leads other blockchains to increase transaction costs. XRP Confirmations Happen in Seconds According to All Things XRP, transactions on the XRP Ledger are confirmed in under 3 seconds, thanks to the absence of block competition. There’s no need to wait for miners or multiple confirmations, making it ideal for real-time payments. XRP Transaction Fees Are Burned Forever Each XRP transaction burns 0.00001 XRP—not sent to validators or miners, but permanently destroyed. This has two critical benefits: Prevents spam by introducing a small cost to every transaction. Creates long-term deflationary pressure by gradually reducing XRP’s total supply. This burning mechanism ensures the network stays fast and efficient—without bloating or abuse. Built for Scale: XRP Handles 1,500 Transactions per Second All Things XRP emphasizes that XRP is capable of handling 1,500 TPS, making it ready for institutional-level volume. While many blockchains slow down under high demand, XRP remains consistent and scalable. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Is BlackRock XRP ETF Coming Soon? Here’s the Truth Behind the $9 Trillion Rumors , Why Institutions Are Turning to XRP From banks to payment providers, institutions are taking notice. Here’s why: No need for costly pre-funded accounts in cross-border transfers. Reliable, low-cost transactions regardless of volume or time of day. Built-in speed, scalability, and cost-efficiency from the ground up. As the analyst notes: “No one wants to pay $30 to send $30. XRP solves that.” Final Thoughts XRP’s fee structure, consensus mechanism , and blazing speed weren’t designed for hype—they were designed for real-world use at scale.

Litecoin historic price sentiment Litecoin Price History: Source CoinStats Litecoin traded between $1 and $5 in its early years before surging to over $300 during the crypto bubble of late 2017 to early 2018. In 2021, Litecoin hit an all-time high of $412.96 early in the year but dropped significantly, closing at $144.56 by the end of the year. In 2022, Litecoin experienced significant losses, dropping below $45 mid-year. However, it managed to outperform the broader market despite a nearly 55% decline overall. 2023 saw high volatility for Litecoin, peaking at $114.50 in July but declining sharply due to market pressures, ending the year at $72.80 with a modest 7% rise despite underperforming the broader market. In 2024, Litecoin started the year around $68.20, climbed to $102.40 in April, and then fell below $80. After further declines in May and June, it dropped to $49 in August before rebounding to $70. By November, Litecoin surged past $100 and attempted to hold above $140 in December. In January 2025, the price of Litecoin surged to $140. However, the LTC price crashed in February as it dropped toward the low of $80. In March, the price of LTC consolidated below $90 after failing to break the $100 resistance. By the end of April, LTC price surged toward the $88 but struggled to maintain that level in early May.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|LTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-17 13:10:00

Analyst Says Moon Mission Is ‘Solid as a Rock!’,https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-to-175k-analyst-says-moon-mission-is-solid-as-a-rock/,"Bitcoin (BTC) is holding steady at around $103,000, but the calm could be the eye of the storm. With volatility compressing and the CME gap still looming like a ghost at $91,970, crypto analysts are torn on whether BTC is headed for glory at $175,000 or prepping for a brutal fakeout. The Bull Case: $175K or Bust? Egrag Crypto isn’t mincing words. In a recent X post , the analyst, more well-known for his takes on XRP, proclaimed that Bitcoin going to $175,000 was “Solid as a Rock!” According to him, that price region is BTC’s “cycle top,” referencing historical EMA breakouts and a 10X extension from 2017’s $20,000 peak. The crypto trader pointed out that, in the past, Bitcoin pumped hard whenever it closed above the 21-week EMA. His breakdown: Pump 1, 60%; pump 2, 170%; pump 3, 75%. That’s an average jump of 101%, which Egrag applied directly to the market’s post-April 21 momentum to reach the $175,000 price level. “Men lie, women lie, numbers don’t,” he quipped. However, not everyone is dancing. Investor Daan Crypto Trades is painting a sobering picture of weekend stagnation and low volatility, with BTC locked in a tight $101,000 to $105,000 range. “We won’t see that much action from Bitcoin for now,” he shrugged, citing low liquidity over the weekend and a possible breakout looming. The Bearish Wrinkles Still, an unfilled CME gap between $91,970 and $92,520 feels like the real twist. Some traders believe BTC must revisit this zone before any meaningful climb can happen. “From the current price, BTC would need to drop around 12% to close this gap,” Egrag Crypto wrote. However, he predicted there was more likelihood of a rally through the $130,000 to $140,000 Fibonacci levels before a 33% correction, followed by a final push to his fabled $175,000. At the time of this writing, BTC was still 4.9% below its all-time high set in January. Its latest price represents a slight 0.4% dip in the last seven days, but it has still outperformed the broader crypto market’s 1.6% drop in the same period.

In a new interview on CNBC Television, David Kelly says that tariffs and other economic factors may cause the country’s economy to slow down in the months ahead. However, he says that the economy may be strong enough to weather the slow growth impacts without falling into an outright recession. “No, we’re not [seeing impacts now]. At the moment, I’d have to say the tariff pullback and also this big tax bill, which is going to put stimulus into 2026 and a little stimulus in 2025, that takes us from more than likely going to have a recession to less than likely we’re going to have a recession this year. So I think the economy may be resilient enough to avoid a recession, but it’s going to be slow growth for a while.” Kelly also says that consumer spending is likely to contract given the uncertainty of the economy, as well as potential inflation from tariff impacts in the coming months. “Consumers are resilient, but there comes a point where you squeeze them enough in terms of tariffs, you’re collecting on the student loans again, and then just the general worry, and, of course, the cutbacks to the government sector, all these things I think are beginning to weigh on consumers. I think it is slowing the economy down, still not willing to say recession.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Meanwhile, a new report reveals that 90% of institutional players are either using or planning to use stablecoins. Bitcoin to $250K in 2025 ‘totally possible’ — crypto analyst Scott Melker Bitcoin’s next explosive move could send the asset to $250,000 by the end of 2025, according to Scott Melker, a crypto analyst and host of The Wolf of All Streets podcast. Speaking in a recent interview , Melker cited growing institutional interest and diminishing volatility as key factors that could drive the next leg up. “250K this year, totally possible,” Melker said, adding that Bitcoin’s volatility has declined significantly in recent years. “It used to be about three times as volatile as the S&P. Now it’s less than two times.” He pointed to increased involvement from pension funds and ETF issuers as evidence of a more mature, stable market. The shift, he argued, reflects a broader trend of institutional adoption. “The more institutional money, the more Wall Street money, the more long-term holders get involved, the less volatility there’s going to be,” Melker explained. World Liberty Financial brushes off oversight concerns from Congress Zach Witkoff, one of the co-founders of the Donald Trump family-backed crypto platform World Liberty Financial (WLFI), has rebuffed efforts by US lawmakers to investigate the president’s potential conflicts of interest. In a May 15 letter to Senator Richard Blumenthal, lawyers for World Liberty Financial claimed a call to investigate the crypto platform was based on “fundamentally flawed premises and inaccuracies.” Witkoff did not specifically address any allegations, claiming that WLFI was “too busy building” for oversight. “The Company rejects the false choice between innovation and oversight,” said the letter. “What it opposes is the misuses of regulatory authority and uncertainty to suppress lawful innovation.” May 15 letter to Sen.

The GENIUS Act, a bill to recognize stablecoins as payment instruments currently being considered in Congress, may be a bellwether for how lawmakers intend to handle the president’s potential conflicts of interest. 90% of institutions “taking action” on stablecoins A report from enterprise-grade digital assets platform Fireblocks shows that 90% of institutional players are using or exploring the use of stablecoins in their operations. The report, published May 15, surveyed 295 executives across traditional banks, financial institutions, fintech companies and payment gateways. Almost half of the respondents (49%) said they already use stablecoins in payments, while 23% are conducting pilot tests and another 18% are in the planning stage. Only 10% of institutions surveyed said they were undecided about stablecoin adoption. “The stablecoin race has become a matter of avoiding obsolescence as customer demand accelerates and use cases mature,” Fireblocks wrote.

Banks use stablecoins for a competitive advantage, to reduce friction and meet customer expectations.

44735103,https://invezz.com/?p=2722034,1747489200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Why MUTM’s structure and yield model make it a top long-term crypto pick,https://invezz.com/news/2025/05/17/why-mutms-structure-and-yield-model-make-it-a-top-long-term-crypto-pick/,"In a market often dominated by short-term hype and fleeting trends, long-term plays are becoming harder to identify — but more important than ever. As retail attention shifts toward fundamentals, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as one of the few projects designed with the long haul in mind. Unlike many presale tokens chasing quick traction, MUTM is built around a clear structure and a real yield model that aligns utility with token value. For those asking what crypto to invest in with a focus on durability and growth, MUTM is starting to stand out for all the right reasons. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum’s foundation is deliberate — and that’s part of its strength. The protocol enables decentralized lending and borrowing, allowing users to access liquidity without selling their holdings. This gives long-term asset holders the flexibility to fund other opportunities or cover expenses while keeping their original investments intact. Borrowers retain control of their collateral while accessing stablecoins through the protocol. At the same time, lenders earn yield based on the platform’s borrowing activity, creating a system that rewards both sides through real economic flow. With this model, MUTM avoids the pitfalls of speculative DeFi projects and instead offers a design that scales with usage, not market noise. What sets Mutuum apart from many DeFi alternatives is how it delivers yield. A portion of the protocol’s earnings is used to buy MUTM tokens from the open market. These tokens are then redistributed to active participants — primarily those holding mtTokens or contributing to liquidity. This model doesn’t just reduce sell pressure — it creates a consistent source of demand, driven by platform usage. As more borrowing occurs, more revenue is generated. That revenue is then recycled back into the ecosystem in a way that supports price appreciation over time. It’s this mechanism that analysts say makes MUTM a strong long-term crypto investment, particularly for holders who prefer stable growth over erratic price spikes. MUTM is priced at $0.025, with over 80% of the fourth presale phase already completed. The next price increase will bring the token to $0.03, followed by several additional phases leading up to a confirmed launch price of $0.06. More than $8.2 million has already been raised, and the holder count is nearing 10,000 wallets. These are numbers that reflect serious buyer interest — not from hype-driven speculators, but from early supporters who understand what a solid DeFi protocol looks like before it goes live. Another reason MUTM is being viewed as one of the best cryptos to buy now for long-term holding is its rollout strategy. Unlike many tokens that go live with only marketing behind them, Mutuum Finance will launch with an active beta version of its platform. From day one, users will be able to lend, borrow, and earn — all through a non-custodial smart contract system that has already been submitted for a full audit by CertiK. This immediate functionality provides assurance to early holders that the token won’t sit idle while development catches up. When users deposit assets into Mutuum’s protocol, they receive mtTokens, which represent their share in the liquidity pool. These mtTokens automatically accrue value over time, increasing in redeemable amount as interest accumulates. In addition to reflecting interest, mtTokens qualify users for distributions of MUTM bought back through protocol earnings. This creates a second layer of passive income, helping to drive long-term engagement and reduce the incentive to sell early. For investors who are tired of chasing pumps and hoping for timing luck, Mutuum Finance offers something more grounded. It’s a platform being developed for real use, with a yield mechanism that is both logical and transparent, and a roadmap that points to actual utility — not just narrative. If you’re evaluating what crypto to invest in with a view toward consistent returns, ecosystem alignment, and smart capital flows, MUTM may be one of the next big crypto tokens to keep an eye on — not just for launch, but well beyond it. In a sea of noise, this is a project quietly building something worth holding.

It’s a cloud-based software engineering agent built to lend a helping hand. Codex will allow developers to automate their work by tackling repetitive (but important) tasks on their behalf. These include fixing bugs, drafting documentation, scaffolding new features, and renaming, refactoring, and writing tests. Keep reading to learn more about Codex, including OpenAI’s intent behind it and why it’s a great example of where we’re headed with AI agents. We’ll also touch upon the growing popularity of AI agents in crypto and DeFi and discuss why MIND of Pepe is the best AI agent in crypto today. More About Codex Starting now, ChatGPT Pro, Enterprise, and Team users can access Codex on their dashboard. Codex will usher in a new era in vibe coding, which, in case you didn’t know, is the practice of using AI tools for software engineering tasks. Unlike traditional coding, which can result in opaque software difficult to debug, Codex has been built to explain exactly what it’s doing, which will help developers fix any future issues. We’re about to undergo a pretty seismic shift in terms of how developers can be most accelerated by agents. – Alexander Embiricos, a member of OpenAI’s product team working on agents Although you can already write code on ChatGPT, the Codex AI agent runs within a sandboxed environment in the cloud, allowing it to run commands and explore folders and even test the code autonomously. OpenAI aims to develop Codex as a ‘virtual teammate’ instead of just an AI assistant. The company says that it’s already using the agent to automate repetitive tasks internally. The launch of Codex is perhaps the perfect opportunity to talk about the AI agent market, which has been on fire in 2025. This DeFi segment surged past $5B in total valuation in 2024, and experts expect it to swell to a brain-melting $47B in the next five years. Just this week, AI-focused cryptocurrencies increased by $10B in market capitalization. If you want to ride the growth of AI agents in crypto, MIND of Pepe could just be what you’re looking for. After all, it’s the perfect example to showcase just how powerful AI-crypto partnerships can get. What Is MIND of Pepe ($MIND)? $MIND is an autonomous AI agent armored with state-of-the-art hive-mind intelligence, which empowers it to assess social sentiments and market trends to identify the next cryptos to explode . To put it more neatly: $MIND is an AI agent that lives on dApps and online platforms like X. There, it chats with the crypto community, acknowledging their insights and opinions on various altcoins. It then uses its AI capabilities to study these data points and find out which cryptos could rally as a result of brewing market hype. It’s worth noting that this AI agent’s real-time crypto recommendations will only be available to $MIND token holders. The $MIND Presale Is Ending Soon Are you, too, guilty of scouring shady websites and scammy Discord/Telegram groups looking for the next big crypto coin ? We know the feeling! Well, both your disappointment as a crypto scout and the color red in your crypto portfolio are going to be a thing of the past in less than two weeks from now when MIND of Pepe finally goes live. Speaking of the $MIND presale, it has had a fantastic run. Hundreds of thousands of investors have pooled over $9.4M in early funding, making MIND of Pepe one of the best crypto presales this year. The presale is coming to an end, though. With less than 14 days to go, this is your last chance to buy $MIND for such a low price – just $0.0037515 per token. If this is your first time buying a new meme coin on presale , here’s our detailed guide on how to buy MIND of Pepe . The Benefits of Buying $MIND Are Endless In addition to receiving its expert crypto investment advice, $MIND presale token holders will also get exclusive access to the tokens the AI agent creates firsthand. You heard that right! MIND of Pepe , because it’s self-evolving, will ultimately have the smarts to create cryptos from scratch. Naturally, these new cryptos will be based on what’s trending in the market, meaning they’ll be in a pole position to rocket to the moon. What’s more, MIND of Pepe also has an extremely rewarding staking mechanism in place. At the time of writing, those who choose to stake their $MIND tokens will get 241% APY. Unlock all these benefits by becoming an early investor in MIND of Pepe today. Seeing as MIND of Pepe will bring about a massive shift in how the average crypto investor picks his portfolio, it should hardly be a surprise that our $MIND price prediction suggests that the token could reach $0.030 by the end of 2030. So, if you become a $MIND investor now for just $0.0037515 per token, you could potentially make 800% in less than five years.

The airdrop excludes venture capitalists and insiders, focusing on retail users. The initiative promotes privacy, fairness, and cross-chain interoperability. Cardano co-founder Charles Hoskinson has unveiled what he calls the “biggest airdrop ever,” which will distribute tokens to 37 million blockchain addresses. He reiterated the announcement during his appearance at Consensus 2025 in Toronto and further detailed it at Paris Blockchain Week 2025. This airdrop, named the Glacier Drop, is designed to mark the launch of Midnight, Cardano’s upcoming privacy-focused sidechain. Two distinct native tokens will be distributed through this event: NIGHT, which will serve as a governance token, and DUST, a token to be used for shielded, private transactions on the Midnight network.

The pattern has seen some of them endure unfortunate experiences, including kidnappings, tortures, suicides, while others have been victims of gruesome murders. In the last ten years, a pattern has emerged in the crypto industry. Influential crypto tycoons have been the victims of some unfortunate events, with some more bizarre than others. These mishaps have caused a conspiracy about the crypto industry, with people debating the crypto millionaires’ curse and how real it is. From helicopter crashes to suicides, and attempted kidnaps, the industry has seen it all. Kidnaps, suicides, and mishaps in the crypto industry Earlier this week, the crypto industry woke up to the sad news of an attempted kidnapping involving the daughter and two-year-old grandchild of a major crypto firm executive. The pair were walking down Rue Pache in Paris when three armed men approached her and tried to force her and her toddler into a white van. During the scuffle, the father of the toddler tried to intervene, but was hit. According to a clip by one of the onlookers from the window of his apartment, the woman grabbed a handgun belonging to one of the attackers as they were attacking her husband before throwing it away. In the clip, the father was yelling, “Help, she is pregnant!” with the scream already attracting attention. The attackers, upon realizing this, entered their van and zoomed off. Although passers-by tried to attack the vehicle, they were only able to make a dent on it with a fire extinguisher. After investigations by authorities in Paris, initial findings revealed that the woman and the toddler were the daughter and grandson of Pierre Noizat, the co-founder of Paymium, a French crypto exchange platform founded in 2011. While the company describes itself as a pioneer in the crypto industry, the fortune of its co-founder is not publicly known. According to a witness who was interviewed, she heard the screams from the victims and went out to check. She mentioned that she only saw hooded men trying to run away while seeing another bloodied man lying on the ground. Another incident that occurred in 2022 saw a crypto millionaire take his life by jumping from the fifth floor of a hotel. Javier Biosca was said to have made his millions from scams , swindling more than 300 Spanish investors. Reports claim that he was threatened by several international mafias before he committed suicide. He presented himself as a professional, lying that he could increase their investment by 25% to 30% every week. His lies didn’t run for too long as the crypto market crashed, causing his investments to drop heavily. In the same year, Russian entrepreneur Vyacheslav Taran died in an air crash, with his helicopter crashing near the resort town of Villefranche-sur-Mer after taking off from Lausanne in Switzerland. The crash was said to have happened in good, clear weather, heaping more mystery on the situation surrounding his death. Before his death, he was the co-founder of investment platform Libertex and Forex Club. He was said to have been flying with an experienced pilot in a single-engine helicopter when it crashed on November 25. In 2022, Nikolai Mushegian drowned on a beach in Puerto Rico after tweeting that he feared the CIA and Mossad were coming after him. He died on October 28, hours after posting his last tweet. The young crypto millionaire had a history of mental health problems, and his family, at the time of his death, didn’t suspect any foul play. “They are going to frame me with a laptop planted by my ex [ex-girlfriend], who was a spy. They will torture me to death,” he said. After his death, one of his friends said his paranoia was based on facts, noting that he was chasing things beyond the ordinary, where he discovered things.

This meme coin is generating serious buzz, currently priced at just $0.0000002 , giving BTC traders an ultra-low-cap opportunity. What’s driving even more excitement is a limited-time 80% bonus on token purchases, using the code FLOPPY80 on the official site. Bitcoin Diamond Hands Drive Price Surge Towards The $110,000 Dream Bitcoin diamond hands are making waves, shifting thousands of BTC between major exchanges, with an analyst noting recent transfers exceeding $100 million in a single move. Just hours ago, over 1,180 BTC surged into a key wallet, closely followed by another 1,038 BTC transfer by Bitcoin diamond hands. These Bitcoin diamond hands’ high-stakes inflows are bold declarations of conviction fueling Bitcoin’s (BTC) rocket ride toward the $110,000 mark. Currently, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading around $103,800, showing strong resilience as it rides a rising trendline toward the coveted $110,000 mark. Despite recent consolidation, the chart reveals a bullish structure, with price bouncing off key support at $101,436 and eyeing resistance near $109,028. As the bullish momentum builds, Bitcoin diamond hands remain calm. Why BTC Traders Are Flocking To FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) AI Tools As Bitcoin diamond hands propel Bitcoin (BTC) toward the $110,000 mark, BTC traders are increasingly flocking to FloppyPepe (FPPE) , a meme coin that blends viral culture with cutting-edge AI technology. Far from just another hype token, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is catching fire across the crypto world, attracting BTC traders with its unique AI-powered ecosystem, Floppynomics model, and fast-growing Memevannah community that’s driving viral momentum on Telegram and X.

The Rise Of FloppyPepe (FPPE): A Meme Coin That Is Both Profitable And Principled Backing the growing excitement around FloppyPepe (FPPE) is its Floppynomics , a token model designed to reward and sustain, and give back. With every transaction, 1% is automatically redistributed to existing holders, offering passive income just for holding the token. Another 1% is burned, gradually decreasing the total supply and creating deflationary pressure that can boost the token’s long-term value, a model that appeals strongly to BTC traders who understand the power of scarcity. The final 1% goes to charitable causes, making every trade a chance to contribute to real-world impact. This unique structure not only creates financial incentives but also promotes a sense of social responsibility and long-term commitment within the community. FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) momentum is undeniable. Its private sale has raised nearly $1 million in under 24 hours — offloading 5 trillion tokens at ground-level prices and showcasing overwhelming demand even before launch. Backed by influential crypto voices like Nass Crypto and inspired by meme legend Matt Furie, this meme coin is the investment to look forward to this bull cycle. With BTC traders and crypto investors rushing into its presale en masse, coupled with its low price of $0.0000002 and 80% bonus using the code FLOPPY80 , now’s the time to get in before the next pricing tier starts.

The rally is driven by a accumulation phase from big holders. According to on-chain analyst Ali Martinez, Ethereum whales have added over 450,000 ETH to their stacks in the last month. This accumulation trend matches the market volatility and growing institutional interest in digital assets. Ethereum’s daily trading volume is now over $20.9 billion, even though the price is struggling to break above $2,500. Whales have accumulated over 450,000 #Ethereum $ETH in the past month! pic.twitter.com/iog41CbHLo — Ali (@ali_charts) May 17, 2025 Ethereum is the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, currently at $298 billion, with a circulating supply of 120.7 million ETH. Ethereum Faces Resistance Despite the weekly rally, Ethereum is now facing resistance. The price is at $2,478, just below the 50-period EMA ($2,535). A descending triangle is forming on the 2-hour chart—a bearish setup—marked by lower highs and support at $2,420. Ethereum Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Resistance zones: $2,535, $2,591, $2,648 Support zones: $2,420, $2,348, $2,278 Bias: Bearish below $2,535 The MACD momentum indicator agrees with this view, the histogram and signal lines are below zero. Recent candle structure shows weak buying interest, more likely to break down. Ethereum Trade Setup: Watch for Triangle Break Ethereum price prediction is coiled, waiting to break out. A strong move below $2,420 with volume could trigger a deeper pullback to $2,348 and $2,278. A bullish engulfing candle above $2,535 would invalidate the bearish thesis and open up for a retest of $2,648 and maybe higher. Short trade setup: Entry: Below $2,420 Target: $2,348 and $2,278 Stop-loss: Above $2,515 For now, we wait. Whales are buying and overall crypto is bullish, so Ethereum’s next big move will come with Bitcoin’s move near $103K. Watch for clean breaks or rejections. BTC Bull Token Nears $6.84M Cap as 71% Staking Yield Drives Demand As Bitcoin stabilizes above $102K, investor focus is shifting toward yield-generating altcoins—none more so than BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The token has now raised $5.87 million out of its $6.84 million presale goal, with a price increase looming as it enters its final funding stretch. What sets BTCBULL apart is its flexible staking model, offering an estimated 71% annual yield with no lockups or withdrawal penalties. This approach gives investors the freedom to earn passive income while maintaining full liquidity—an attractive alternative to traditional DeFi staking protocols. Key Stats: USDT Raised: $5,878,513.14 / $6,844,387 Token Price: $0.002515 Staking Pool: 1.47B BTCBULL Yield: 71% APY BTCBULL merges the viral appeal of meme tokens with the real-world utility of DeFi, making it a standout pick for those looking to capitalize on the 2025 crypto cycle. With under $1 million left before the next price tier, entry at current levels is limited—fueling urgency among retail investors seeking early access to passive yield.

Eric Council Jr. of Huntsville pleaded guilty to charges tied to the January 2024 hack of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s X account, according to a U.S. Department of Justice press release . Posing as a telecom customer using a fraudulent ID, Council used a SIM-swap technique to hijack a phone number tied to the SEC’s account. His co-conspirators then used it to falsely post that the agency had approved spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), a long-awaited regulatory milestone. Within minutes, the price of bitcoin surged by more than $1,000. It crashed soon after, losing more than $2,000 in value once the post was revealed as fake. The SEC did later that month approve the launch of spot bitcoin ETFs. Authorities say Council was paid in bitcoin for his role. He will serve 14 months in prison followed by three years of supervised release. Federal prosecutors called the attack a calculated attempt to manipulate financial markets. “The deliberate takeover of a federal agency’s official communications platform was a calculated criminal act meant to deceive the public and manipulate financial markets,” said Acting FBI Assistant Director Darren Cox. “By spreading false information to influence the markets, Council attempted to erode public trust and exploit the financial system”",Policy|X|SEC|Bitcoin|News,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|SPONSORED|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-17 13:46:36

Coinbase stock soars despite difficult week,https://crypto.news/hack-sec-probe-coinbase-stock-soars-difficult-week/,"Coinbase stock price had its best week since November last year, even as the company moved from one bad news to another. Coinbase shares ended the week at $266, their highest level since February and 88% above their lowest level this year. This gives Coinbase a market cap of over $67.8 billion. Coinbase stock price weekly performance | Source: TradingView Coinbase experienced major headwinds This rally happened in a difficult week for the company and the crypto market. First, the recent crypto market rally stalled, with Bitcoin ( BTC ) remaining stubbornly below $105,000 and many altcoins crashing by double digits from their monthly highs. Second, Coinbase revealed a major hack that may cost it over $400 million. The hackers collaborated with overseas staff, received sensitive data, and demanded a $20 million ransom. Coinbase revealed that it will not pay the ransom but instead will pay for tips leading to the hacker’s arrests. Third, it was revealed that Coinbase was under an SEC probe for misstating customer data in its disclosures. The probe centers on whether the company has over 100 million verified users, as it claimed in filings. Coinbase has insisted that it stopped reporting that number two years ago. Why Coinbase stock price soared Coinbase stock price rose despite these headwinds because these events will not have a major impact on its business. First, the ongoing pullback in the crypto market will likely be temporary, with most analysts predicting more Bitcoin gains in the long term. Ark Invest expects BTC to hit $2.4 million in 2030, while BlackRock has a $700,000 target. You might also like: Bitcoin price eyes ATH as traders brace for a “supply shock” Second, historically, the impact of a hack to a company’s performance is usually limited. For example, Equifax’s stock price has jumped since 2017 when it was hacked and data on 147 million customers was stolen. Other companies that have thrived after their hacks were Target, Home Depot, Sony, and Capital One. Also, there is a probability that Coinbase has insurance coverage that will help with any related payments. Third, the ongoing SEC probe started under the Biden administration, meaning that the Paul Atkins-led agency may decide to end it. The SEC has already ended many previous probes started by Gary Gensler. Further, this week’s events did not lead to a downgrade by Wall Street analysts. Some of the most bullish ones are from Benchmark, Rosenblatt, Oppenheimer, and Compass Point. These analysts cite its strong market share in the U.S. and its expansion to the derivatives market through the Deribit acquisition . Most importantly, the Coinbase stock price jumped ahead of its addition to the S&P 500 Index on Monday. This addition means that all funds that track the index will be forced to buy the stock.

The face-to-face meeting between Vietnamese Trade Minister Nguyen Hong Dien and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer happened in Jeju, South Korea, right after the 31st APEC Ministerial Meeting on Trade. According to Reuters, the sit-down marked the first formal ministerial-level talk between the two countries on the issue. The US has postponed the massive tariff until July, but Vietnam isn’t taking any chances. The levy would hit at a time when Hanoi depends heavily on selling goods to the US, which is still its biggest export market. On top of that, foreign factories operating in Vietnam to serve American retailers could get crushed under the new tax burden. The potential hit is so big because last year alone, Vietnam had a $123.5 billion trade surplus with the US—the fourth-largest of any country. Nguyen pushes for compromise as Greer supports proposal Nguyen and Greer’s Friday meeting wasn’t their first communication. The two had already spoken last month on a call that formally opened the negotiation track. During that earlier call, Greer signaled support for Vietnam’s approach to the growing trade imbalance. In the Jeju talks, both parties seemed eager to keep things moving forward. “USTR Greer agreed with Vietnam’s current approach and proposal,” the Vietnamese trade ministry said in a public statement on Saturday. “The United States hopes that with the mutual efforts, the technical-level negotiations in the coming days will yield positive results.” To cool tensions and shrink the trade surplus, Vietnam has already made some concessions. Hanoi has cut tariffs on US-bound goods and has started cracking down harder on Chinese exports using Vietnam as a backdoor to dodge American taxes. Those transshipments have long irritated US trade officials, who accuse Chinese companies of rerouting their products through Vietnamese ports to sneak around Trump’s import levies. The danger now is that even these efforts might not be enough. If Washington imposes the 46% tariff, it will impact hundreds of factories and assembly plants that power Vietnam’s export engine. Electronics, furniture, clothing—all of it could get hit. And any disruption to American-bound trade also risks spooking investors who have poured capital into Vietnam as a safer, cheaper alternative to China. China and US trade reps meet while Beijing stays quiet on Trump-Xi talks While Vietnam was scrambling, China’s trade envoy Li Chenggang was also making moves. On May 12, Li met with Greer on the sidelines of a separate event in Switzerland, marking the first high-level US-China meeting in months. When asked by CNBC whether the talks were helpful, Li simply said , “Definitely,” offering no details. He also claimed he didn’t know if President Donald Trump would speak directly with Chinese President Xi Jinping, despite Trump suggesting earlier in the week that a call could happen soon. Beijing didn’t add anything either. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce’s daily press briefing started an hour late that day, and its spokesperson He Yongqian gave no updates. Even with the radio silence, analysts watching the situation said that a direct conversation between Trump and Xi would likely be needed before anything major happens. Still, the first Geneva negotiations had their impact. China’s side saw it as proof that standing firm against US pressure could still open the door to future talks. The two countries agreed to temporarily lower tariffs to buy time and launched a new “communication mechanism” to keep channels open on economic and trade issues.

This move, highlighted in a recent report by Uphold, marks a pivotal moment for XRP, signaling growing institutional interest and the maturation of the digital asset’s market infrastructure. Here’s your #XRP Report for the week: CME Group to Launch XRP Futures on May 19 CME Group is set to launch $XRP futures on May 19, pending regulatory approval. This marks a major step toward institutional adoption of XRP, offering new tools for both hedging and… pic.twitter.com/i0pHj3wXSq — Uphold (@UpholdInc) May 17, 2025 CME Group’s Strategic Expansion into XRP Futures CME Group’s decision to introduce XRP futures is a strategic expansion of its crypto derivatives offerings, which already include Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana futures. The new XRP futures contracts will be cash-settled and available in two sizes: a micro contract covering 2,500 XRP and a standard contract of 50,000 XRP. These contracts will be based on the CME CF XRP-Dollar Reference Rate, calculated daily at 4:00 p.m. London time, ensuring transparent and consistent pricing for market participants. Giovanni Vicioso, CME Group’s Global Head of Cryptocurrency Products, emphasized the growing interest in XRP and its underlying technology: “Interest in XRP and its underlying ledger (XRPL) has steadily increased as institutional and retail adoption for the network grows, and we are pleased to launch these new futures contracts to provide a capital-efficient toolset to support clients’ investment and hedging strategies”. Market Implications and Institutional Adoption The introduction of XRP futures by CME Group is expected to have significant implications for the market. It provides institutional investors with regulated instruments to hedge against price volatility and gain exposure to XRP without the need to hold the underlying asset. This development is particularly noteworthy given the recent increase in XRP’s trading volume and institutional interest. In the first quarter of 2025, CME Group reported an average daily volume of 198,000 contracts across its crypto futures and options, representing approximately $11.3 billion in notional value, a 141% increase year-over-year. Open interest also surged by 83% to 251,000 contracts, equivalent to $21.8 billion in notional value. The addition of XRP futures is expected to further bolster these figures, reflecting the growing demand for diversified crypto investment products. Retail Access and Broader Market Impact In addition to institutional adoption, the launch of XRP futures is poised to enhance retail investor participation. Trading platform Robinhood has confirmed plans to offer CME’s XRP futures to its users, broadening retail access to these regulated instruments. JB Mackenzie, Robinhood’s VP and GM of Futures and International, stated that adding XRP futures aligns with the platform’s mission to enhance retail investor participation in futures markets, complementing its existing spot crypto offerings. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The availability of XRP futures on platforms like Robinhood democratizes access to sophisticated financial instruments, allowing a broader range of investors to engage with the crypto derivatives market. This increased accessibility is expected to contribute to greater liquidity and price discovery in the XRP market. Potential for Spot XRP ETFs The establishment of a regulated futures market for XRP may also pave the way for the approval of spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The existence of a futures market under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) could address previous concerns from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding market manipulation and investor protection. Several asset managers have already filed proposals for spot XRP ETFs, with projections suggesting these could attract substantial assets upon approval. The upcoming launch of XRP futures by CME Group represents a significant milestone in the evolution of the cryptocurrency market. By providing regulated, transparent, and accessible instruments for both institutional and retail investors, this development underscores the growing maturity and acceptance of digital assets in mainstream finance. As the market continues to evolve, the introduction of XRP futures is poised to play a crucial role in shaping the future landscape of crypto investment and risk management.

44735050,https://finbold.com/?p=245544,1747490767,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,"Bitcoin to hit $130,000 on this date, according to analyst",https://finbold.com/bitcoin-to-hit-130000-on-this-date-according-to-analyst/,"As Bitcoin ( BTC ) consolidates just below $105,000, an analyst has identified a historical trend that could propel the flagship cryptocurrency to a new all-time high in the coming weeks. Since bottoming in early April, Bitcoin has moved in a clear $10,000 step-like pattern, first breaking through $74,000, then $84,000, $94,000, and now consolidating near $104,000. This consistent progression has seen each primary level tested and breached, forming a well-defined upward channel. According to prominent crypto analyst TradingShot in a TradingView post on May 16, this formation suggests that Bitcoin is trading within an ascending channel, indicating room for continued gains. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView/TradingShot If the channel holds, the next potential milestones are $114,000, $124,000, and ultimately $134,000, a key target TradingShot projects for late June or early July. However, the bullish structure comes with risks. A breakdown below the channel’s lower boundary could trigger a sharp correction, with possible support retests around $94,000 or even $84,000. Bitcoin’s path to $120,000 Adding to the bullish sentiment, analyst Ali Martinez noted in a May 17 X post that Bitcoin could aim for a new high near $120,000, provided it maintains support above $90,000. Martinez’s analysis was based on the “Cumulative Value Days Destroyed” (CVDD) indicator, which signals that Bitcoin is currently in a healthy accumulation phase. Historically, this metric has identified market tops and bottoms, and the current trend suggests a potential blow-off top around $120,000. Bitcoin Cumulative Value Days Destroyed chart. Source: CryptoQuant According to the chart, Bitcoin is now in the final stages of accumulation. The CVDD is $34,153, while major resistance is $124,088. Support remains at $90,000, an area that aligns with key psychological and technical levels. Amid this optimistic outlook, Bitcoin has recently hovered between $104,000 and $105,000. Analysts believe the asset may be consolidating within a bullish flag, a continuation pattern following its strong surge from $74,400 to $105,900. That rally was fueled by margin liquidations and strong spot demand, backed by billions in BTC ETF inflows. Bitcoin price analysis By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $102,977, down about 0.6% on both the daily and weekly charts. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Still, BTC remains well above its 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) of $90,993 and its 200-day SMA of $86,134, reinforcing strong bullish momentum. The gap between the current price and these moving averages suggests the uptrend remains intact, even if a short-term pullback occurs.

According to a May 16 report from Bloomberg , Roelof Botha, Managing Partner at Sequoia Capital, was among the victims whose personal information was compromised. The breach, which targeted Coinbase users through a social engineering campaign, allegedly stemmed from a bribery scheme involving customer service agents contracted by the exchange. Botha Manages Assets Worth Hundreds of Millions While Botha’s personal holdings remain undisclosed, he is believed to manage assets worth hundreds of millions. Coinbase confirmed the incident in a May 15 blog post, stating that cybercriminals had gained access to customer data by exploiting internal support systems. The attackers reportedly demanded a $20 million ransom, which Coinbase refused. The full scope of the breach remains unclear. Security teams at Kraken and Binance are also investigating similar intrusion attempts, Bloomberg reported, although neither exchange has publicly confirmed exposure. Philip Martin, Coinbase’s Chief Security Officer, revealed that the compromised support staff were based in India and have since been terminated. The company has filed a disclosure with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, estimating remediation costs between $180 million and $400 million. The breach hit Coinbase’s stock hard, with shares (COIN) dropping over 7% to $244 before recovering slightly to $264.24. Coinbase suffered a massive data breach.

The breach comes at a critical moment for the crypto industry’s regulatory outlook and could influence legislative sentiment as the bills move toward a vote. Coinbase Q1 Revenue Climbs, But Profit Falls 94% Coinbase reported mixed first-quarter results , with revenue rising 24% year-over-year to $2 billion, but falling short of analyst expectations and down 10% from the previous quarter. While transaction revenue grew to $1.26 billion, its subscription and services division—covering staking and custodial offerings—rose 37% to nearly $700 million, reflecting growing diversification beyond trading. Despite the revenue uptick, net income plunged 94% to $66 million as the company marked down its crypto holdings amid market volatility. Adjusted earnings stood at $526.6 million, or $1.94 per share, still below last year’s figure of $2.53. Operating expenses surged 51% to $1.3 billion due to aggressive marketing and asset write-downs. Coinbase’s earnings were weighed down by unpredictable macroeconomic conditions and fluctuations in digital asset prices. However, the company noted its second-highest ever monthly user count, with CFO Alesia Haas highlighting increased engagement across non-trading services.

This comes after establishing a small clientele that uses deposit accounts and payment features for tasks like sending payroll and collecting money, as US regulations became clearer. According to Hoffman, the Cincinnati-based lender is also looking into using stablecoins to help with cross-border transactions, which will help reduce expenses and improve the efficiency of value transmission. Fifth Third also aims to integrate with additional payment rails, allowing customers to trade digital assets and pay for crypto purchases through its extensive payment network. Trump’s pro-crypto stance influences banks to increase their crypto push Hoffman revealed that Fifth Third Bancorp started establishing connections with cryptocurrency companies about five years ago but deferred significant investments until regulations were clearer. In addition, the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX in 2022, which ultimately resulted in the demise of cryptocurrency-friendly lender Silvergate, also caused banking sentiment toward the asset class to deteriorate. However, Hoffman says the time has come to increase the cryptocurrency push. This came after Hoffman stated in an interview that it became evident that the ideal moment to get involved is now. He added that a group of people was actively researching and experimenting in this area. Moreover, the head of strategy at the bank stated that Fifth Third, which OCC is the primary regulator and has assets worth over $200 billion, comprises a group of full-time workers devoted to digital assets. Hoffman brought up the essence of financial institutions working with all business lines and corporate departments, including compliance, liquidity management, and treasury. According to him, it is a whole bank effort. Rodney Hood, the acting head of the Office of the Comptroller of Currency, also announced a significant modification to the crypto laws that will benefit crypto banks. In early March, Hood explained that banks can now use blockchain technology for payments, custody of crypto-assets, and certain stablecoin activities, which previously required written approval. The US government has greatly influenced this significant shift in cryptocurrency, particularly in financial institutions that carry out crypto activities. Since assuming office, Donald Trump’s administration has placed proponents of digital assets in important government posts, facilitated policies that help the sector, and pursued his own cryptocurrency ventures. Furthermore, some of the biggest banks in America are now planning how to increase their business under less strict regulations as the industry matures. US regulators roll back crypto restrictions to support innovation in banking On April 24, US banking authorities declared that they were removing several documents that advised financial institutions to exercise caution when experimenting with cryptocurrencies and associated activities. This included two supervisory letters that required banks to obtain regulators’ advanced approval before participating in crypto-asset and stablecoin activities. The Fed also joined the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in withdrawing two 2023 statements that advised banks to exercise caution when dealing with cryptocurrency-related risks. In the previous guidance, regulators cautioned banks about the risks of volatility, legal uncertainties, and liquidity when deciding whether to offer services related to cryptocurrency or take on clients that are cryptocurrency companies. The removal of that guidance was the Trump administration’s most recent action to adopt a more pro-crypto stance. The Fed announced that regulators would investigate the appropriateness of new guidance to support innovation, including crypto-asset activities. In March, the OCC was the first US regulator to take action to facilitate banks’ participation in cryptocurrency activities, reversing previous administration guidelines that advised the financial institutions to exercise caution around the industry.

According to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on May 15, the company has completely terminated its position in Nubank. According to the SEC filing, Berkshire sold 20.7 million shares in the third quarter at an average price of $13.46, starting with 40.2 million shares in 2024. Another 46.3 million shares were sold in the fourth quarter at an average price of $13.22. The remaining 40.2 million shares were sold in the first quarter of 2025 at an average price of $11.83, completing the transaction. The total sale generated a net gain of approximately $250 million.

The company reported net income of $557.2 million in the first quarter of 2025, up 47% from the previous year. Adjusted net income was $606.5 million. Through 2024, Nu Holdings had an annual net income of $1.97 billion, up 91% from the previous year. Berkshire not only sold Nubank, but also all of its shares in Citigroup and reduced its holdings in Bank of America and Capital One. Citigroup sold 14.6 million shares, while Bank of America sold 48.7 million shares, reducing its stake in the company by 7%. Capital One was reduced by 300,000 shares (4%).

Amid these conditions, Unilabs , a $0.005 utility coin, is capturing their interest with its massive growth potential and utility-centric features. It is the first next-gen DeFi asset manager that leverages artificial intelligence to simplify the investment procedure. Its presale success is already making waves in the industry, and analysts believe it could even surpass major players in the crypto industry. Let’s see how: Read more: Brave Wallet expands support with Cardano integration Unilabs: A utility altcoin becoming the top pick for ada whales While the Cardano price faces setbacks, Unilabs is gathering the attention of ADA whales with its utility-centric approach to investment. Even at this early stage, this DeFi investment protocol possesses over $30 million in Assets Under Management (AUM). Along with this, the platform offers a unique Memecoin Identification Tool that allows investors to take advantage of the ongoing memecoin trends at the right time, keeping them ahead of the game. In short, it simplifies the process of investing in memecoins by updating the users on potential early opportunities. Unilabs also features an analysis tool named Market Pulse that could scan multiple data sources in the crypto market to identify the right investment opportunities that perfectly align with the user’s requirements. Another remarkable feature of this fund is its portfolio management tool that utilizes AI insights. Users can rely on it as it could track upcoming market shifts and adjust the portfolio accordingly to reduce risk exposure. Presale gain momentum as investors rush to grab $0.005 UNIL token As ADA whales rush to Unilabs, its presale sells out at lightning speed. Currently, stage 2 of the presale is going on, and the platform has already crossed the $400k milestone in funding. At this stage, the UNIL token is available at just $0.005, serving as a perfect opportunity to secure massive gains for early investors. This protocol offers several benefits to early UNIL holders, such as up to 30% reduction in the platform’s fees. Additionally, it offers users the chance to earn passive income with its referral program. In addition, investors could also stake their UNIL tokens to earn multiple rewards. Cardano price struggles as bulls lose steam Although the Cardano price had experienced a considerable surge of around 28% in May, its upward momentum is waning. Over the past week, the ADA token has lost more than 1.6% of its value. From a broader angle, the Cardano price started forming an ascending channel from early April. During this span, the price of the ADA token even hit the $0.8 mark. Investors were expecting a continuation of this bullish trajectory, with the Cardano price hitting the $1 mark again this year. However, the ADA token failed to live up to this projection and faced a significant decline to around $0.74. In addition, the on-chain data from Santiment also revealed the fading interest of traders as the selling pressure increases. Along with this, the technical indicators are also signaling a bearish outlook for the Cardano price as the Bollinger bands are widening, which could lead to increased volatility. Analysts warn that the ADA token could even drop to its crucial support at around $0.71. Therefore, the ADA early whales are switching to Unilabs that offer enhanced utility for just $0.005. Final thoughts As the Cardano price’s increasing volatility raises concerns about its future trajectory, ADA whales decide to switch to Unilabs because of its enhanced utility and explosive growth potential. It is establishing itself as a strong contender in the crypto industry with its advanced AI ecosystem and diverse range of funding options. Investors are advised to take advantage of the ongoing presale stage, as it offers the best bargain to secure massive returns. To learn more about Unilabs, visit the official website , and Telegram.

A federal judge in North Carolina has preliminarily approved a $4.1 million class action settlement between Truist Bank and cellphone users who say they were hit with the unwanted calls, reports The Charlotte Observer. The lawsuit against Truist was filed by a class of 5,998 people with Kevin Truong, a resident of Texas, serving as the lead plaintiff. Truong says he received at least 35 robocalls from Truist Bank between September 14th and December 31st of 2021. According to the complaint, Truong was neither a customer of the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank, nor had he consented to receiving the calls. “These calls injured Plaintiff by invading his privacy, interfering with his cellular telephone, and wasting his time.” The suit alleges the robocalls, which originated from call centers and were intended to locate or collect payments from the bank’s customers, violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991. Among other things, the Act prohibits making robocalls to a “cellular telephone service” or “initiating any call to a residential telephone line using an APV [artificial or prerecorded voice] to deliver a message without the consent of the called party.” While Truist Bank denies liability in the lawsuit, it has agreed to settle to avoid the expenses and uncertainty associated with a lengthy trial. Class members could each receive approximately $440, per the report. As of December 31st of 2024, Truist Bank had a little over $523 billion in total assets, according to the Federal Reserve.

44735733,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=753321,1747492241,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/44735733.jpeg,Elon Musk Becomes ‘Kekius Maximus’—Meme Coin Soars 120%,https://www.newsbtc.com/meme-coin/elon-musk-becomes-kekius-maximus-meme-coin-soars-120/,"Elon Musk’s latest profile name change on X has sent ripple effects through the crypto market yet again. After swapping his profile to “Kekius Maximus” with a Roman‑style frog avatar, the meme‑inspired token tied to that name shot up by almost 120% in just 24 hours. Based on Binance data, traders saw KEKIUS climb from an average of 0.025 to 0.0502 overnight. Related Reading: Price Down, Bets Up: Dogecoin Open Interest Climbs To $1.62 Billion Musk Sparks Another Frog Coin Surge According to reports, this isn’t the first time Musk’s social‑media tweaks have moved meme coins. Last December, he adopted the same name and a golden‑armored Pepe image. That move drove KEKIUS nearly 500% higher in a single day before prices tumbled back. His followers treat each change like a buy signal. They pile in fast when they see a new profile name. Then many scramble to exit once the hype dies down. 𝕏 is news by the people for the people. Seeking truth, but always self-critical. — Kekius Maximus (@elonmusk) May 15, 2025 Price Jumps 119% In A Day Binance figures show the token’s value leapt 119% within 24 hours of Musk’s latest switch. CoinMarketCap data confirms it hit 0.0502 at the peak, up from about 0.025 just a day earlier. That level is still far below its initial launch price last year. At one point, speculators were paying 0.25 for a single KEKIUS token before the first big crash. History Of Kekius Maximus Name Kekius Maximus blends several things at once. “Kek” started as gamer slang for laughing. It also links back to an Egyptian frog‑headed god of chaos. Maximus echoes the gladiator hero from a famous movie. The token itself runs on both Ethereum and Solana blockchains. Creators say they wanted to mix memes, myth and pop culture. But there’s no big tech behind it—just a playful mashup that reacts to Elon Musk’s mood swings. Risky Ride For Investors Based on reports, this pattern shows just how wild crypto can get when a celebrity is involved. These tokens offer no real product or service. They live or die on hype alone. When the profile name flips back, they often collapse. Traders who jump in at the peak can face heavy losses. Regulators have flagged such pumps as a concern. They warn that celebrity chatter can mask the true risk under the surface. Related Reading: Analysis: Crypto Heats Up As $35 Billion Enters Market In Under A Month A Wider Trend In Meme Tokens Earlier this month, Musk tried a different name—“Gorklon Rust”—and a related coin, GORK, doubled in value. That name combined his AI chatbot’s name with a programming language used by X’s engineers. Again, traders treated it like an open invitation. GORK saw a 100% spike in 24 hours. But it then gave most of that back when the novelty wore off. What To Watch Next Investors who follow these moves need to stay alert. Such jumps can happen without warning, and they can reverse just as fast. Some see them as short‑term bets, almost like casino plays. Others treat them as entertainment. Either way, it’s clear that Musk’s profile choices remain a powerful crypto driver. And for many tokens, that power can vanish as quickly as it appears.

According to a recent report by Micah Paul XRP, XRP garnered 26,000 searches on the platform, surpassing Onyxcoin’s 14,000 and Bitcoin’s 13,000 searches. This trend highlights XRP’s growing prominence among crypto enthusiasts and investors. XRP’s Rising Popularity on Coinbase The heightened attention towards XRP on Coinbase aligns with its remarkable performance in trading volumes. Data indicates that XRP accounted for over 25% of Coinbase’s 24-hour trading volume, translating to approximately $1.7 billion in trades. In comparison, Bitcoin’s trading volume stood at $1.3 billion, representing about 19.6% of the exchange’s total volume. The most searched crypto on @coinbase is #XRP ! #XRPArmy #XRPCommunity pic.twitter.com/lb73qVio3L — Micah Paul XRP (@MicahPW20) May 16, 2025 This surge in searches and trading activity demonstrates a renewed wave of interest in XRP, possibly fueled by recent market developments and speculation. Reasons Behind XRP’s Popularity Surge Several factors have contributed to XRP’s surge in popularity. Notably, the cryptocurrency has experienced a significant price rally, with its value increasing by over 600% since November 2024, reaching a peak of $3.33. This rally has propelled XRP to a market capitalization of $187 billion, placing it ahead of major corporations like Adobe and HSBC. Another contributing factor is the speculation regarding XRP’s potential role as a digital reserve in the U.S., though these rumors remain unverified. Additionally, investor sentiment has been boosted by the anticipation of XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with approval odds reportedly exceeding 70% on various betting platforms. Such developments have likely played a crucial role in drawing more attention to the digital asset on Coinbase. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Onyxcoin and Bitcoin: The Runners-Up Following XRP, Onyxcoin (XCN) and Bitcoin ranked second and third, respectively, in Coinbase searches. Onyxcoin saw 14,000 searches, while Bitcoin trailed slightly with 13,000. Onyxcoin, in particular, has garnered attention following a dramatic 1000% rally over two weeks, although it faced subsequent corrections amid broader market fluctuations. Despite its volatility, Onyxcoin’s trading volume on Coinbase surged, at times surpassing even that of XRP, Solana, and Bitcoin. Coinbase as a Market Sentiment Indicator Founded in 2012, Coinbase is the largest U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange, serving over 100 million users across more than 100 countries. The platform’s substantial user base and wide-reaching influence make it a significant indicator of market trends and investor sentiment. The surge in XRP searches on Coinbase, therefore, reflects a broader shift in interest within the crypto community, indicating XRP’s potential resurgence as a favored asset. The recent data from Coinbase underscores a shifting landscape in cryptocurrency investments, with XRP gaining substantial traction among both retail and institutional investors. As the crypto market continues to evolve, XRP’s prominence on platforms like Coinbase highlights its growing influence and potential as a leading digital asset. Whether this increased interest will translate into sustained market dominance remains to be seen, but for now, XRP is undeniably in the spotlight.

BlockchainFX’s $BFX Could Be the Next Exchange Token to Explode",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/05/missed-binances-529000-gains-blockchainfxs-bfx-could-be-the-next-exchange-token-to-explode,"In the world of crypto investing, timing is everything. The story of Binance’s meteoric rise from a small startup in 2017 to the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, and the astonishing 529,000% gain in its native token BNB, is legendary. Yet for many investors, that opportunity came and went in the blink of an eye. Today, a new contender is emerging with the potential to follow a similar path: BlockchainFX (BFX) . And for those who regret missing out on BNB’s early days, the BFX presale may represent a rare second chance. How Binance’s BNB Delivered One of Crypto’s Greatest Returns When Binance launched its initial coin offering (ICO) in July 2017, BNB was priced at just $0.11. Few outside of a tight circle of early adopters saw the potential. But by 2021, BNB had soared to an all-time high of over $690, a staggering 529,000% gain from its original price. The growth wasn’t fueled by hype alone. Binance’s aggressive expansion, listing strategy, and user-first approach turned it into the dominant exchange globally. Meanwhile, BNB evolved from a simple fee-reduction token into a core asset used across Binance’s chain ecosystems, DeFi platforms, and NFT marketplaces. Those who bought and held BNB early didn’t just see impressive returns, they witnessed one of the greatest wealth-creation events in modern financial history. What Is BlockchainFX and Why Is It Generating So Much Buzz? BlockchainFX aims to be the next evolution of crypto trading platforms. Instead of focusing solely on crypto assets, it offers users the ability to trade across over 500 instruments, including cryptocurrencies, stocks, ETFs, commodities, and forex all through a single, unified crypto-native app. BlockchainFX isn’t just replicating what traditional exchanges offer; it's building a bridge between crypto and global finance, where users can seamlessly move between asset classes without switching platforms. However, the real opportunity today isn’t just in using BlockchainFX after it launches—it’s in securing early exposure to $BFX tokens during the presale. This is when prices are at their lowest, staking rewards are active, and upside potential is maximized. Why BlockchainFX’s Presale Could Deliver Explosive Returns Currently in its presale stages, BFX is priced well below its projected listing levels. Early buyers can earn daily staking rewards immediately in both BFX and USDT, with yields reaching up to 90% APY. Top holders could even earn as much as $25,000 per day in staking rewards as BlockchainFX’s trading volumes scale. Adding to the urgency, buyers using the code BFX30 can still secure 30% more tokens, but this bonus offer is only available for a limited time. Unlike many presales, BlockchainFX has already completed rigorous audits from CertiK and Coinsult, and its team is fully KYC-verified by Solidproof, giving investors an additional layer of trust. Beyond the token itself, early BFX holders will also gain access to exclusive BlockchainFX Visa Cards, available in metal and 18K gold editions, with up to $100,000 per transaction limits and $10K monthly ATM withdrawals, an unprecedented level of real-world utility linked to a presale token. Why Crypto Experts Believe BlockchainFX Could Be the Next Binance Several leading voices in the crypto community, including influencers like ClayBro, have compared BlockchainFX’s early ecosystem structure to Binance’s launch in 2017. The similarities are compelling. BlockchainFX is launching with an aggressive multi-asset strategy, positioning itself at the crossroads of crypto and traditional finance, much like Binance positioned itself at the heart of crypto expansion. It combines high utility with strong staking incentives, powerful community-building mechanisms, and institutional-grade security audits—all hallmarks of projects that tend to outperform over the long term. Moreover, the global appetite for seamless asset management is growing. Platforms that allow users to trade crypto, stocks, commodities, and more under one roof are poised to capture a massive share of the next wave of financial adoption. BlockchainFX is aiming to be the leader of that trend. For early investors, the parallels to Binance’s early BNB days are hard to ignore—and so is the potential upside. Is This A Rare Second Chance in a Crowded Market? The cryptocurrency market rarely offers genuine second chances. BlockchainFX's $BFX presale, however, could be exactly that—a rare opportunity to get in at the foundation level of what many believe will be the next major exchange ecosystem. With staking rewards already live, real-world utility at launch, and a limited-time 30% bonus for early buyers, BFX is the top exchange token to watch right now for those looking to maximize returns ahead of the next crypto bull cycle. For investors who missed Binance's 529,000% gains, this is a moment that demands attention, and swift action.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) was trading at $103,000, 2.8% below its highest level this month. This slight pullback has brought its market cap to $2.045 trillion. Moody’s US credit rating downgrade The biggest macro-related news on Friday came from Moody’s, one of the big three credit rating agencies globally. In a statement, the company downgraded the US credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing the worsening fiscal situation in the US. Moody’s joined the other two agencies in removing the triple-A rating. S&P Global was the first one to cut the rating in 2011, and was then followed by Fitch Ratings in 2022. The rating downgrade came a year after Moody’s changed its outlook of the US economy to negative. The rating downgrade came as the US fiscal situation has worsened, with the total public debt jumping to over $36.8 trillion. Medicare and Medicaid spending jumped to $1.6 trillion, while social security, defense, and interest have soared to $1.5 trillion, $900 billion, and $1.02 trillion, respectively.

That’s partly because the Trump administration is also keen to cut taxes, increasing the deficit by $4.5 trillion in the next ten years. The US credit rating cut may be a positive catalyst for Bitcoin, an asset slowly emerging as a safe haven. For example, Bitcoin has done better than the stock market since the Liberation Day speech . It also did better than stocks during the COVID-19 pandemic. Bitcoin is also supported by supply and demand dynamics. Its supply on exchanges and over-the-counter markets, has continued falling, while demand is rising. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have attracted over $41 billion in inflows since January last year, while companies like Strategy and Twenty One have continued buying. Bitcoin price technical analysis BTC price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that Bitcoin price has remained in a consolidation phase in the past few days, with its volume continuing its downtrend. On the positive side, Bitcoin has remained above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average. It has also formed a bullish pennant pattern, a popular continuation sign. This pattern comprises of a vertical line and a symmetrical triangle, resulting in a strong bullish breakout. Bitcoin has also formed a cup-and-handle pattern, comprising a rounded bottom and some consolidation. These patterns point to more gains in the coming weeks. A move above the upper side of the cup will point to more gains, potentially to $110,000 and above.

On the charts, XRP/USD is stuck in a descending channel on the 1-hour chart, with price consolidating at $2.35. The channel has clear lower highs and lower lows, meaning bearish control. The 50-period EMA at $2.40 is capping upside, while MACD lines are below zero—no bullish momentum. Price just rejected the midline of the channel, so sellers are in control.

The token has now raised $5.87 million out of its $6.84 million presale goal, with a price increase looming as it enters its final funding stretch. What sets BTCBULL apart is its flexible staking model, offering an estimated 71% annual yield with no lockups or withdrawal penalties.

44737348,https://invezz.com/?p=2722050,1747493940,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,MUTM is gaining momentum: analysts rank it among the top cryptos to watch,https://invezz.com/news/2025/05/17/mutm-is-gaining-momentum-analysts-rank-it-among-the-top-cryptos-to-watch/,"With market sentiment gradually shifting back toward fundamentals, the spotlight is starting to shine on projects that offer more than speculation. At the center of that discussion is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) — a DeFi protocol now climbing analyst watchlists and gaining momentum as one of the top cryptocurrencies to watch this quarter. Still in presale, still priced under $0.03, and already attracting significant capital, MUTM is quickly becoming a standout among early-stage crypto investment opportunities. And it’s not just because of price — it’s because of how the system is designed to grow. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) The attention around MUTM stems from a simple but powerful combination: clear utility, a functioning revenue model, and a smart rollout plan. While many tokens rise and fall based on trend cycles, Mutuum is approaching growth with structure — and that’s something seasoned analysts have taken notice of. This is a project that doesn’t rely on big marketing spikes to move forward. It’s gaining support because of what’s being built and how that build is being funded. Mutuum’s current presale phase is already nearing its final stages, with over 80% of Phase 4 completed. Once this phase concludes, the price will rise from $0.025 to $0.03, with the final launch set at $0.06. This structured progression is helping to bring in long-term buyers, not just short-term flippers. Mutuum Finance is fundamentally a decentralized platform that enables users to lend and borrow assets without surrendering custody. The protocol allows users to borrow against their digital assets without having to liquidate them — unlocking capital while maintaining market exposure. This isn’t new to DeFi, but what makes Mutuum different is how it handles the backend. As borrowers pay interest, a portion of that revenue is used to buy MUTM tokens from the open market. The purchased tokens are subsequently distributed to active participants in the ecosystem, especially to those who hold mtTokens. It’s a yield loop that creates real demand based on actual usage. And with a fixed supply of 4 billion tokens, that demand isn’t competing with an endless stream of newly minted coins. Mutuum is also earning credibility by launching with substance. The team has confirmed that a beta version of the platform will go live alongside the token listing, giving users access to core features from day one. Lending, borrowing, and rewards will be available immediately — setting the stage for protocol engagement to start early and scale over time. This approach to launching reinforces the project’s level of preparedness. Instead of promising future milestones with vague timelines, Mutuum is showing that it can deliver on its roadmap before going public. For many investors deciding what crypto to invest in, this level of transparency and execution is key. When users deposit assets into Mutuum, they receive mtTokens, which represent their position in the protocol. As interest is paid by borrowers, mtTokens steadily accrue value — and also qualify holders to receive a share of the MUTM tokens bought through the revenue loop. This structure incentivizes users to stay active within the protocol, reinforcing long-term participation and limiting volatility. It’s a model designed for sustained growth, not short-lived spikes — and it’s one reason why analysts believe MUTM will outperform other low-cap tokens over time. With more than $8.2 million already raised, nearly 10,000 holders, and growing visibility across trading communities, Mutuum is no longer just a presale story — it’s quickly becoming a key contender among next big crypto projects. MUTM is backed by a revenue-driven system, a fixed supply model, and real DeFi utility — and it’s those traits that are beginning to matter again. As the market matures, serious buyers are gravitating toward assets that offer more than just potential — they want structure, mechanics, and clear value alignment. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) delivers on all three fronts, positioning it as one of the top crypto investment opportunities to keep an eye on this quarter. Its price is still low. Its rollout is on schedule. And its model is built for resilience — not reaction.

Today’s fintech companies offer excellent user experiences but are constrained by traditional financial infrastructure — siloed, slow, expensive and inflexible. Meanwhile, DeFi provides lightning-fast, cost-effective, interoperable infrastructure but lacks mainstream accessibility. The solution? Combine fintech’s distribution and user experience with DeFi’s efficient back end. The mullet is inevitable Fintech companies heavily rely on traditional financial (TradFi) infrastructure that is siloed, slow to deploy and run, and costly to maintain. This inefficiency limits their control over costs and product offerings and has potential infrastructure risks. Fintechs have a strong incentive to transition to building on autonomous, credibly neutral public infrastructure. The power of DeFi is evident in stablecoins. While traditional international wire transfers cost $30–$50 and take one to five business days, stablecoin transfers cost mere cents and settle in seconds. This revolutionary improvement in financial infrastructure extends beyond payments. DeFi provides 24/7/365 infrastructure for trading, lending and borrowing with instant settlement, open access and deep liquidity, enabling better price execution and yields. Plugging their compliance-ready front end into DeFi infrastructure, fintech companies can focus on creating exceptional user experiences. This opens up tremendous opportunities for innovation while driving more liquidity onchain, creating a positive feedback loop of embracing the DeFi Mullet. Now is the time for mainstream adoption Today’s DeFi ecosystem has proven its reliability for fintech integration. There are dozens of protocols that demonstrate this maturity, securely managing billions in loans through immutable, governance-minimized designs. DeFi infrastructure gives fintechs complete control over their infrastructure. This is particularly crucial after the recent Synapse bankruptcy that trapped Yotta user funds meant to be insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Recent: Bitcoin DeFi will have 300M users, beating Ethereum and Solana: Exec Institutions are also coming onchain. BlackRock has tokenized a fund via Securitize; Stripe has acquired Bridge for $1 billion to scale its stablecoin solutions; the US is creating a strategic Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve; and clarity on regulation is opening the floodgates. The shift is step-by-step but tangible. DeFi has arrived. The next phase For years to come, expect more products like crypto-backed loans to be released by fintech’s most advanced players, offering onchain saving accounts, onchain loans, instant international payments and more. This transformation will be invisible to users and powered by smart wallets and account abstraction that maintain the familiar Web2-like user experience at which fintech companies excel. Early adopters will gain significant advantages over competitors. Yet, unlike building on traditional finance, DeFi’s open infrastructure means even latecomers can benefit from existing network effects without starting from zero. Some skeptics argue that the involvement of fintechs and traditional institutions will erode decentralization, as protocols must comply with regulatory requirements. While this concern is understandable, the opposite is more likely. Expecting protocols to achieve compliance across every jurisdiction worldwide is unrealistic, especially given the vast regulatory fragmentation. Instead, regulating the apps that interface with users makes far more sense rather than the underlying protocols. For this regulatory model to work, however, protocols must remain credibly neutral. A credibly neutral mechanism adheres to four principles: It embeds no preference for specific individuals or outcomes. It is open-source with publicly verifiable execution. It is simple and understandable. It changes infrequently. Examples like HTTP and SMTP demonstrate the power of credibly neutral protocols — they are free, open and unregulated, with only the clients subject to oversight. The same logic should apply to governance-minimized, immutable DeFi protocols. These constraints will push DeFi builders toward creating genuinely decentralized and trustless systems. Fintechs integrating DeFi protocols can build on top of the most neutral infrastructure and access their growing network effects. Let the mullet grow The DeFi mullet is more than just a meme — it’s a structural shift. To scale, DeFi must meet users where they are: through regulated, user-friendly fintech channels. For fintechs to stay relevant, they must offer their customers the best user experience and opportunities, such as the best rates. Those who miss this opportunity risk falling into irrelevance, much like traditional retail banks losing market share to today’s fintechs. This convergence isn’t just possible — it’s inevitable.

Meanwhile, the BONK future remains less certain, showing strong setups but still acting unpredictably. While MNT and BONK spark debates among chart analysts, BlockDAG (BDAG) is experiencing an entirely different kind of action, buyers are going head-to-head for daily rewards. BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles now offer a massive 150 million BDAG coins each day, triggering intense competition. With a temporary $0.0020 price still active, well below the current batch rate, interest has exploded, pushing presale totals to $253 million. Mantle (MNT) Builds Toward a Key Resistance Near $0.86 There’s growing attention on Mantle (MNT) bullish momentum as the token nears a major resistance line at $0.86. A breakout past this level could be the trigger needed to push MNT closer to the key psychological milestone of $1. Price charts show a consistent uptrend, with higher highs and lows supported by solid volume during rallies. While the RSI remains neutral, indicators are showing early bullish signals. A MACD crossover might confirm this soon. The recent dip to $0.77 attracted notable buying, reinforcing that the Mantle (MNT) bullish momentum isn’t just hype; it’s rooted in strong technical signals. Analysts and traders are watching closely for what comes next. BONK Shows Technical Promise, but Uncertainty Still Dominates The BONK future remains a puzzle, even as charts offer interesting signals. On April 28, BONK respected key supply and demand zones, which helped shape short-term confidence. However, things look trickier on the 1-hour chart, where a recent liquidity sweep below key levels could now serve as the base for a possible upward move. Despite the setups, traders remain cautious. The BONK future doesn’t always follow conventional rules. Price behavior can flip unexpectedly, which means traditional strategies may not hold. As always with meme coins, discipline and risk control are essential. BlockDAG Booms as 150M Coin Pool in Buyer Battles Adds Fuel! BlockDAG has escalated the game. Its Buyer Battles have grown from 25 million BDAG per day to 150 million, following a sharp rise in participant numbers. Buyers are not just purchasing, they’re competing. Each day, the biggest buyer wins the remaining share of the day’s 150M coin pool. Take this scenario: If buyers purchase 149.5 million coins in a day, the top buyer walks away with the leftover 500,000 BDAG. With the current batch 28 price at $0.0262, that reward is worth $13,100. This format has added serious momentum to the presale. BlockDAG has now raised $253 million and sold over 20.6 billion BDAG coins, inching closer to its $600 million goal. What’s drawing even more attention is the limited-time $0.0020 pricing, available until June 13. It’s a steep discount from the batch rate, and buyers are rushing in to lock it down. BlockDAG is quickly rising on buyer watchlists as a candidate for the best crypto right now, especially for those focused on numbers over noise. BlockDAG has already confirmed its first five centralized exchange listings: MEXC, LBANK, CoinStore, XT.com, and BitMart. On June 13, it will unveil the remaining 15, bringing the total to 20. Trading won’t begin that same day, but it will set the stage for post-presale listings once the $600 million target is met. This move is strategic. Most projects keep exchange details under wraps until late, but BlockDAG is showing its hand early. It’s part of a broader push to build trust and transparency as buyers line up. At this pace, the final target doesn’t seem far off. By the time most buyers catch up, the opportunity window may already be closing. Which Coin Holds the Edge? The Mantle (MNT) bullish momentum is solid, driven by clear technical support and resistance levels. A breakout could open the door for a rally to $1 and beyond. The BONK future, however, remains highly speculative, with sharp price moves that are tough to predict. Then there’s BlockDAG. When compared to both MNT and BONK, it stands out for its structure and execution. Its 150 million BDAG daily Buyer Battles have transformed the presale into a competitive event. Add to that a time-sensitive $0.0020 price offer and 20 confirmed exchange listings, and it’s no wonder many see it as the best crypto right now. For those looking for early momentum, clear growth targets, and a community-driven campaign, BlockDAG offers more than just upside, it offers strategy with speed.

In a video posted on X, he explained why XRP reaching higher price levels, including $40 or even $100, is not as improbable as critics suggest. According to Pantoja, one of the biggest errors made by XRP skeptics is equating market cap increases with direct capital inflow. “Only about $20 or $30 billion would have to come into XRP in a short amount of time to get into that $2.5 trillion market cap,” he said. $XRP can get to $100 and ""Market Cap"" doesn't matter…here's why… pic.twitter.com/TelYVV3eVW — Armando Pantoja (@_TallGuyTycoon) May 16, 2025 This contrasts sharply with the assumption that over $1.4 trillion in new capital would be needed to push XRP’s market cap to that level. Pantoja stated that “market cap doesn’t matter,” and his explanation makes the many bullish predictions for the digital asset feasible. Understanding Thin Liquidity Pantoja emphasized that cryptocurrencies operate in thin liquidity environments, making them more susceptible to large price movements from relatively small amounts of capital. Unlike mature markets, where a significant influx of funds is needed to influence prices, crypto markets can experience large changes in market cap with minimal inflow because asset prices are based on the most recent transaction multiplied by total supply. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 To illustrate the concept, Pantoja described a simplified example involving home sales. If a neighborhood has 100 houses, each valued at $500,000, the total value is $50 million. But if one buyer pays $1 million for a single house, the market assumption shifts, and each home is now considered to be worth $1 million, raising the market value of the neighborhood to $100 million. However, only $500,000 in new money entered the market. This same dynamic applies to crypto. When demand for XRP rises sharply in a short period and buyers are willing to pay more for the limited available supply, prices increase rapidly, and the market cap follows. Implications for XRP’s Future The distinction between market capitalization and capital inflow is crucial when evaluating XRP’s potential. Bitcoin’s market cap, for instance, has doubled in the past without a corresponding $2 trillion entering the market. The same principle applies to XRP. Pantoja’s argument reframes the conversation around XRP’s valuation. Rather than focusing on the total capital required, attention should be placed on supply, demand, and transaction pricing. “That’s why market cap is not equal to inflow,” he said. This clarity on the market cap myth is vital in a space filled with misinformed commentary and oversimplified metrics.

As the crypto market recovers slightly from the latest bearish pressure, investors are again facing the challenge of identifying which digital assets carry the most long-term potential. To help answer the question of whether XRP or BNB is the better five-year bet, The Crypto Basic sought opinions from two of today's most advanced AI models: ChatGPT from OpenAI and Grok from xAI. XRP and BNB's Comparative PerformancesWe asked both chatbots to evaluate a hypothetical investment of $10,000 into either XRP or BNB , considering their current performance, market trends, and future outlook.For context, XRP currently trades at $2.38, posting a remarkable 252% surge since 2024. Even in the current year, 2025, it has managed to climb another 15.3%. XRP's market cap now stands at $139.4 billion, cementing its place as the third-largest crypto asset , excluding stablecoins.Meanwhile, BNB trades for $653. Its performance since 2024 has also been impressive, up 78.86%. However, its trajectory this year has faltered, with a 7% decline since the start of 2025. BNB's market cap trails behind XRP at $92 billion, but it still holds a strong position in the market.When we asked for their opinions, both ChatGPT and Grok leaned toward XRP as the more promising investment over the next five years. Each model cited different reasons for favoring XRP, but some of these reasons appear to have overlapped.ChatGPT Picks XRP, Citing Growing Utility According to ChatGPT, XRP is entering what it describes as a major transformation period. It stressed that recent regulatory developments have removed much of the uncertainty that previously surrounded the asset. As a result, XRP is moving from being merely speculative to becoming an asset with legitimate institutional appeal. The model pointed to the expanding adoption of Ripple's technology in global financial systems, particularly in cross-border payments, as a sign that XRP's use case is increasingly becoming practical. XRP or BNB ChatGPT Responds XRP or BNB | ChatGPT Responds Moreover, ChatGPT highlighted the emergence of ETF filings related to XRP, which could present the asset a pathway into mainstream investment channels and institutional portfolios. In contrast, ChatGPT suggested that BNB is increasingly linked to the fate of the Binance exchange, which is under regulatory scrutiny in several major markets. It argued that this centralization and dependence pose limitations on BNB's long-term upside, especially when compared to XRP's global footprint and legal clarity.Grok Picks XRP, Citing Performance and Market SentimentGrok presented a similar preference for XRP, but its reasoning leaned more into performance and market sentiment. The xAI model pointed out that XRP has outperformed BNB since the start of 2024 and also maintained positive momentum in 2025, contrasting BNB's recent losses. XRP or BNB Grok AI Responds XRP or BNB | Grok AI Responds Grok saw XRP's higher market capitalization as evidence of greater investor confidence and mentioned the asset's ability to satisfy the growing need for efficient cross-border payment solutions as another factor that could support its long-term growth.In comparison, while it acknowledged BNB's utility within the Binance ecosystem, Grok expressed concern over its recent dip in value and questioned its short-term stability.",Market|Latest Binance Coin (BNB) News Market Updates|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today|XRP Price Prediction,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|XRP|BNB,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-05-17 15:09:34

Over the past 24 hours, XRP recorded a staggering trading volume of $445 million, surpassing even Bitcoin and Ethereum. This renewed trading frenzy underscores the strong demand for XRP in South Korea, a market known for its deep liquidity and enthusiastic crypto traders. XRP’s Dominance on South Korean Exchanges South Korea has historically been one of the strongest markets for XRP, with retail investors and institutional players consistently driving high volumes. Unlike in other regions, where Bitcoin and Ethereum typically dominate, XRP has carved out a unique position in the Korean market due to its fast transaction speeds, low fees, and the strong presence of Ripple’s technology in cross-border payments. $Xrp is the most traded Crypto on Korean exchange In 24, hours reached $1.824 billion pic.twitter.com/ehINYjdf5j — Brett (@Brett_Crypto_X) May 17, 2025 Upbit’s trading data reveals that Korean traders have maintained a strong appetite for XRP , often making it one of the most liquid assets on the platform. This is not the first time XRP has led trading activity on Upbit, but the latest surge in volume reinforces its resilience and growing appeal among South Korean investors. Factors Driving XRP’s Popularity in South Korea Several factors contribute to XRP’s sustained popularity in South Korea. The country’s crypto-savvy population is known for embracing high-momentum tokens, and XRP’s recent price movements have attracted significant attention. Additionally, the anticipation of favorable regulatory developments and the potential for XRP to play a role in future financial systems have fueled investor interest. Moreover, South Korean exchanges like Upbit offer deep liquidity for XRP, allowing traders to execute large transactions with minimal slippage. This makes XRP an attractive asset for both retail and institutional investors seeking efficient trading opportunities. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Implications for the Global Crypto Market XRP’s dominance in South Korea may have broader implications for the global cryptocurrency market. South Korean trading activity often serves as a bellwether for worldwide trends, and the country’s enthusiasm for XRP could signal increased adoption and investment in other regions. As XRP continues to gain traction in key markets, its role in the evolving digital asset landscape becomes increasingly significant. The cryptocurrency’s performance in South Korea highlights the importance of regional dynamics in shaping global crypto trends and underscores the potential for XRP to play a pivotal role in the future of digital finance. In conclusion, XRP’s recent surge in trading volume on South Korean exchanges reaffirms its strong position in the market. As investors and traders continue to seek opportunities in the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, XRP’s performance in South Korea serves as a compelling example of how regional markets can influence global trends and drive the adoption of digital assets.

With large caps making headlines, smart money is already rotating into smaller, undervalued projects with strong fundamentals and near-term upside. Leading that shortlist is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi project still trading below $0.03 and steadily building momentum. For those searching what crypto to invest in after the BTC wave, analysts are pointing to platforms like Mutuum that offer more than just hype — they offer structure, utility, and real income mechanics. And that combination is rare at this stage of the market. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) MUTM is currently in the final stages of its fourth presale phase, priced at $0.025, with over 80% already sold. The next pricing tier will move the token to $0.03, before reaching its confirmed launch value of $0.06. That alone represents a 140% price difference from current levels, but many analysts believe this is just the beginning. Once the token goes live — paired with immediate access to lending and borrowing features — expectations are building for a significant post-launch move. One key reason behind this forecast is Mutuum’s Layer 2 integration strategy. By launching the platform on a Layer 2 network, the protocol will benefit from lower transaction fees, faster execution, and higher scalability — all critical for real-time lending operations. This infrastructure enables users to lend or borrow assets seamlessly, without the friction of high Ethereum gas fees. As the platform scales, this increased efficiency helps drive higher protocol revenue — a key component of MUTM’s long-term value strategy. Here’s where the tokenomics stand out. When users take out loans on the platform, part of the interest they pay is used to buy MUTM tokens from the open market. These acquired tokens are then shared with participants, especially those who hold mtTokens as a reflection of their contribution to the liquidity pool. This model creates organic buy pressure fueled by actual protocol activity. Mutuum channels value back to its ecosystem based on utility, not speculation. That structure has helped MUTM earn a place on lists of the best cryptos to buy now, especially for investors focused on long-term yield potential. With launch price set at $0.06, projections vary — but a growing number of analysts see MUTM moving well beyond that figure once trading opens and platform usage begins. Let’s break it down with a fresh investment example: When an investor were to enter now with $2,200 at the current $0.025 rate, and the token surged to $0.42 within weeks after listing (driven by protocol adoption and exchange visibility), that position would be worth $36,960 — a 1,580% return. This isn’t just based on speculation. It’s a reflection of the platform’s ability to generate revenue, redistribute value, and scale its user base from day one. Another major advantage is product readiness. Mutuum has announced that a beta version of its platform will launch alongside the token listing, giving users immediate access to key features without any delay. Borrowing, lending, and passive income tools will be active immediately — creating engagement, usage, and momentum that fuels token demand in the early stages of market exposure. With Bitcoin’s rally pulling capital back into crypto, many traders are now rotating their focus to undervalued opportunities with strong fundamentals. For those asking what crypto to invest in now, MUTM offers a combination of low entry, platform readiness, and a sustainable revenue model — all wrapped into one early-stage asset. As capital shifts from blue chips to next big crypto projects, Mutuum Finance is emerging as a serious contender. Still affordable. Still underexposed. But engineered for long-term growth.

44737223,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoiners-guide-south-africa-garden-route,1747495283,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png,A Bitcoiner’s guide to South Africa’s Garden Route,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoiners-guide-south-africa-garden-route?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"South Africa’s Garden Route, famed for its lush forests, expansive beaches and charming towns, has become a testbed for Bitcoin adoption. From Mossel Bay to Witsand and Plettenberg Bay to Knysna, Bitcoin has become popular among shop owners and travelers alike for a multitude of reasons. “We’re seeing the early signs of a parallel, permissionless economy emerging across an entire region,” James Caw, founder of SimplB — a local crypto asset provider — told Cointelegraph, “where small businesses benefit from faster, lower-cost digital payments and where people have more options to earn, send and receive sound money securely.” For tourists, the benefits are immediate: no currency exchange hassles, no international card fees, and the ability to pay instantly and securely. For locals, Bitcoin ( BTC ) offers a hedge against inflation, protection from currency volatility and new economic opportunities. Here’s a taste of what a Bitcoin-friendly trip along the Garden Route is like. The Garden Route is where Bitcoin meets paradise The Garden Route is one of South Africa’s premier tourist corridors. It stretches roughly 300 kilometers from Mossel Bay in the west to the Storms River Mouth in the east, attracting hundreds of thousands of tourists yearly. Crypto adoption is escalating thanks to South Africa’s regulatory environment, which now recognizes Bitcoin as a financial product. Across the Garden Route, you can spend pre-acquired Bitcoin freely, with little concern for local tax or exchange controls. It’s a grassroots movement. Towns like Witsand and Plettenberg Bay are at the forefront, and national retailers like Pick n Pay provide a safety net for crypto spending along the way. Every Pick n Pay store, including supermarkets, clothing outlets and Express convenience stores, accepts Bitcoin via the CryptoQR app. This guarantees you can always buy daily goods with Bitcoin wherever you travel. Related: Stablecoin fever: 5 major stablecoins are growing crypto adoption Witsand is the Bitcoin village Located at the mouth of the Breede River, Witsand is a sleepy coastal town with a big reputation in the Bitcoin world. Here, Bitcoin isn’t just accepted — it’s preferred. It’s thanks to the efforts of local champions like Edwin Jones, a software engineer and passionate supporter of Bitcoin adoption in the Garden Route. Witsand has become a functioning Bitcoin circular economy. Accommodation options like Fantasea and Happy Days holiday homes, meals at Ellie’s on Main, groceries at local shops, gym memberships, boat services, petrol, surf lessons and mini-golf can be paid for using Bitcoin. As Jones notes: Bitcoin Witsand existed long before we gave it a name. It was just having conversations with friends, and as the local businesses started understanding Bitcoin, they actually demanded we start getting the technology in place. The town’s small and close-knit community has enabled rapid adoption; more than 45 establishments accept Bitcoin as of early 2025. The town’s enthusiasm is infectious, as locals and visitors enjoy the ease and security of digital payments. Witsand proudly announces its acceptance of Bitcoin. Source: Edwin Jones Witsand’s success as a Bitcoin hub is rooted in its community-driven approach. Jones outlines its growth by outlining that: Although there have been many individual businesses over the years since 2009 that started and stopped accepting Bitcoin for the Garden Route, the adoption really started kicking off in 2021. “With the Lightning Network starting to reach maturity around that time, the first Spaza Shop in Mossel Bay, Bitcoin Ekasi, started accepting Bitcoin in August 2021, and the first restaurant in Witsand in December of the same year.” Education has been central to the process. Local advocates have focused on teaching business owners the fundamentals of Bitcoin, warning against scams and emphasizing the difference between Bitcoin and speculative altcoins. “With all the circular economies advocating against gambling and trading, cautioning against interest and investments, being explicitly Bitcoin, and focusing on the fundamentals rather than the price, scammers have been kept at bay,” Jones said. “We have also found that businesses don’t have to adapt as much as evolve.” Bitcoin doesn’t change a business — it just supercharges it. Doing the same old things, much better. Mossel Bay’s surf and social upliftment Mossel Bay, the historical gateway to the Garden Route, is not just about beaches and maritime history. Mossel Bay is home to Bitcoin Ekasi, a pioneering project that brought Bitcoin to the township of JCC Camp. Bitcoin Ekasi empowers unbanked residents by enabling them to earn and spend Bitcoin locally. Coaches at The Surfer Kids nonprofit are paid in Bitcoin, and local spaza shops accept Bitcoin for daily necessities. For the Bitcoiner tourist, Mossel Bay offers a unique opportunity for “conscious crypto-tourism.” You can take surf lessons from instructors paid in Bitcoin, visit the Bitcoin Ekasi education center, or support the project with direct donations. The town also boasts a Pick n Pay that accepts Bitcoin. As SimplB’s Caw observes: The Bitcoin Ekasi project first started when they began accepting Bitcoin because of the demand from foreign tourists visiting Mossel Bay. It is just so simple to function on a Bitcoin standard once you begin using it. Plettenberg Bay is the fastest-growing Bitcoin economy Further east, Plettenberg Bay has witnessed an explosion in Bitcoin adoption. In just a few months, the number of Bitcoin-accepting merchants jumped from five to more than 75, making it one of Africa’s most dynamic crypto economies. Confirmed acceptors include Ferris Cars (which facilitates rental accommodation payments in crypto), Glow Lighting Design and all local Pick n Pay branches. Adventure tourism companies, boutique retailers and professional services are increasingly receptive to Bitcoin, especially if you ask. The rapid growth suggests an enthusiastic local scene, with businesses eager to tap into the spending power of Bitcoin tourists. Related: 8 major crypto firms announce US expansion this year Plettenberg Bay offers a vibrant mix of beach life, nature and crypto-friendly commerce. The town’s energy is palpable, and visitors are encouraged to engage with merchants, share information about Lightning payments, and help grow the ecosystem. “Right now Plettenberg Bay is by far the most interesting circular economy in Africa and possibly the world,” said Jones. “It currently boasts having the most businesses accepting Bitcoin of any town in Africa and has achieved this in less than three months.” Bitcoin preferred signs can be found along the Garden Route. Source: Edwin Jones Sedgefield is a quiet pioneer Sedgefield, a tranquil town between Knysna and Wilderness, played a key role in the national rollout of Bitcoin payments at Pick n Pay. It was one of the trial sites for the innovative QR code converter from MoneyBadger, which enables Bitcoin spending at every Pick n Pay in South Africa. Sedgefield itself doesn’t have the same density of Bitcoin-accepting independent merchants as Witsand or Plettenberg Bay, but the presence of Pick n Pay ensures that crypto tourists can always pay for groceries and essentials with sats. Practical information for your trip If you do make it out to the Garden Route, recommended wallets include Blink, Wallet of Satoshi and Phoenix — all Lightning-enabled and widely used in the region. In larger towns like Knysna, George, Wilderness and Oudtshoorn, the Bitcoin scene is still emerging. There aren’t yet established circular economies, but the nationwide acceptance of Bitcoin at Pick n Pay provides a reliable foundation for spending. The Spasie on Breede Restaurant and Bar is just one of many establishments accepting Bitcoin. Source: Edwin Jones BTC Map occasionally lists independent merchants, like Beans About Coffee in Oudtshoorn. Still, the best strategy is to ask around, look for Bitcoin signage, and use mapping tools to discover new acceptors. For accommodation, activities and dining, direct inquiry remains key. Many guesthouses and tour operators are open to Bitcoin payments, especially as awareness grows. Online platforms like Bitrefill enable you to buy gift vouchers for major retailers using Bitcoin, providing a workaround for places that don’t yet accept crypto directly. Happy travels.

The S&P 500 ended the week 2.7% higher, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Russell 2000 inched 0.9% and 0.7%, respectively. The Nasdaq Composite rose 3.6% in the week. The market was also buoyed by strong economic data, with inflation cooling to 2.3% in April and jobless claims holding steady, although consumer sentiment remains low, with the University of Michigan's index falling to 50.8, the second-lowest on record. Overall, the indicators remain encouraging and the market appears bullish, at least for the short term. Amid the positivity, these were some of the trending stocks for the week: Tesla ( TSLA ) led a Monday rally among the “Magnificent Seven” after the U.S. and China agreed to a 90-day tariff truce, slashing levies on both sides. The news lifted tech stocks, with Amazon up 8% on Monday, Apple 6.2%, Meta 8%, Nvidia 5.4%, Alphabet 3.4%, and Microsoft 2.4%. Nvidia ( NVDA ) turned positive for the year this week, becoming the latest member of the “Magnificent 7” to move into the green. The recent surge came after CEO Jensen Huang announced Tuesday that Nvidia would supply more than 18,000 of its top AI chips to Saudi Arabia. The news followed Huang’s appearance alongside other tech executives and U.S. President Donald Trump at a Saudi-U.S. investment forum in Riyadh. Doximity ( DOCS ) dropped on Friday after the online medical platform issued Q1 and fiscal 2026 guidance below expectations, citing macroeconomic uncertainty, despite topping Street estimates with its Q4 FY25 results. Solar stocks rallied on Tuesday as House Republicans moved toward a more moderate deal on clean energy tax credits, easing industry concerns. First Solar ( FSLR ) advanced nearly 22% for the week, Array ( ARRY ) +22%, Maxeon Solar Technologies ( MAXN ) +10%, Sunrun ( RUN ) +25%. UnitedHealth Group ( UNH ) slipped on Tuesday after CEO Andrew Witty announced his resignation for personal reasons. At the same time, the company withdrew its 2025 guidance, citing a continued rise in medical care utilization. Dick’s Sporting Goods ( DKS ) on Thursday struck a $2.4B deal to acquire Foot Locker ( FL ), uniting two retailers impacted by U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff battles. Foot Locker shares soared more than 80% in premarket trading, while Dick’s slipped as much as 13%. Walmart ( WMT ) posted another strong quarter of sales and earnings growth, but warned that tariffs and mounting economic uncertainty could eventually force the retail giant to raise prices. Baristas at roughly 100 unionized Starbucks ( SBUX ) locations went on strike since Sunday in protest of the company’s new dress code, according to the labor group representing them. Beyond the dress code dispute, contract talks between Starbucks ( SBUX ) and its unionized workers have stalled for over two years. Starbucks Workers United recently rejected the company's latest proposal, which included annual raises of at least 2%, saying it fell short on wages, healthcare, and scheduling guarantees. Super Micro Computer ( SMCI ) j umped on Wednesday as it entered a multi-year partnership agreement with Saudi Arabia-based data centre company. The deal, valued at $20B, is expected to “fast-track delivery of ultra-dense GPU platforms and rack systems for DataVolt’s hyperscale AI campuses in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the U.S. CoreWeave ( CRWV ) drew attention on Thursday after the cloud service provider reported first-quarter revenue that beat expectations and earned praise from Wall Street in its debut quarter. However, shares fell amid concerns that the company is set to spend between $20B and $23B this year on AI infrastructure capacity. Boeing ( BA ) shares touched a new 52-week intraday high on Wednesday after confirming a $96B order for up to 210 widebody jets from Qatar, following a separate order from Saudi Arabia a day earlier for 20 737-8 jets with options for 10 more. The company, alongside GE Aerospace ( GE ), secured a $14.5B commitment from Etihad Airways to invest in 28 American-made Boeing 787 and 777X aircraft powered by GE engines. Coinbase Global ( COIN ) said it expects to pay $180M-$400M in reimbursements and remediation after a recent data breach exposed sensitive customer information and led to users being tricked into sending funds to the attackers. On May 11, the crypto exchange ""received an email communication from an unknown threat actor claiming to have obtained information about certain Coinbase customer accounts. Applied Materials ( AMAT ) fell after the semiconductor equipment maker reported mixed fiscal second quarter results, with revenue missing estimates despite 7% Y/Y growth. Novo Nordisk ( NVO ) fell on Monday after Eli Lilly’s ( LLY ) Zepbound outperformed Wegovy in a head-to-head trial, showing 47% greater weight loss. Later, on Friday, Novo ( NVO ) announced that its CEO, Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen, will resign from his leadership role as the company searches for his successor. The drugmaker said that the leadership transition was made in light of the company’s recent market challenges and the performance of its stock since mid-2024.

However, Trump reiterated his criticism of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, saying, “'Too Late Powell' will probably mess things up again.” Trump said that almost everyone agreed that the Fed should cut interest rates soon. However, he suggested that Powell would mismanage this process as he had done in previous steps. Trump had also said of Powell in April that “he should be removed from office immediately” and described him as “a big loser.” Trump backed down for a while when markets were in turmoil after those statements, but he reacted again this month when interest rates were not cut.

Iran has been facing severe power outages, with hospitals and factories unable to operate for months. Aside from this, there have also been extreme temperatures without relief. While the Iranian regime has often deflected the blame , a significant amount of that has been put on the Khamenei-led regime. According to reports, most of the issues in the country are the direct result of the activities spearheaded by entities linked to the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. Under Khamenei, residents have accused powerful cartels of plundering national electric resources, with most of these activities also linked to the Islamic Guard Corps (IRGC). Khamenei-linked cartel accused of misusing scarce resources According to several reports from the country, the groups prioritize profitable crypto-mining operations and seeking vital foreign currency, while the Iranian populace is left to suffer the effects of the collapsing power grid. The turning point to what it is now was the sanctions imposed on the country by the United States, especially after they withdrew from the nuclear deal with Iran in 2019, and the reimposition of oil and banking sanctions. After these events, reports of crypto mining farms being set up in Iran were at a high. Coincidentally, in the summer of 2019, when these reports became rife, severe power outages started to become a thing, with the entire country suffering as a result. According to several sources, the timing was not a coincidence. Under the directive of Khamenei, the IRGC entered into a collaboration with Chinese partners, where they established mining operations to generate Bitcoin and other digital assets as a means to compensate for the country’s reduced access to US dollars. These farms, which depended on high amounts of energy, suddenly became a primary source of the blackouts. According to reports, the IRGC, which serves as the pillar of the crypto mining entities, uses its power over the economy and security outfits to direct these operations. Reports mentioned that the IRGC, in collaboration with entities like Astan Quds Razavi, a charitable trust under the supervision of the Supreme Leader. These organizations form the cartel and allegedly divert state resources for their personal gains. Iranian regime blames the general public for power outages Iran officially recognized the crypto mining industry as legal in 2019, with its licensing being managed by the Ministry of Industry, Mines, and Trade. According to estimates, around 180,000 mining equipment are in use in the country, with 80,000 belonging to private entities. This leaves about 100,000 in the control of states or state-affiliated firms. This development, according to reports, allegedly allows the cartels to operate under a legitimate umbrella, diverting a big share of the country’s energy. However, despite evidence of state-controlled entities draining the national grid, the regime has often blamed the general public for the power outages. They blame a rise in household consumption – a narrative that has not held up under scrutiny. While Iranians have been facing darkness and power outages, the IRGC has been working with the cartels to use the limited energy resources unchecked. Reports also claim that anytime enforcement actions occur, they often target small unauthorized private miners in the country. According to these reports, the main reason behind these developments is a calculated strategy for Khamenei and the IRGC to enrich themselves.

According to top analyst J4b1 , a massive rally could be triggered as XRP joins the futures ETF club, following the same pattern that drove up Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana prices. XRP Futures ETF by CME Group Launching May 19 In a bold move, the CME Group is set to launch XRP futures ETFs on May 19 —a historic milestone that mirrors how BTC and ETH surged following their own futures ETF approvals. In a recent post on X, J4b1 highlighted how this could be XRP’s most significant turning point yet. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse weighed in, stating , “While overdue in a bunch of ways, this is an incredibly important and exciting step in the continued growth of the XRP market.” This move comes as over 80 crypto ETFs await approval in the U.S.— 20 of which are for XRP alone. With pro-crypto Paul Atkins as the new SEC Chair , the landscape has shifted drastically from the previous administration’s stance. This leadership change could fast-track spot ETF approvals and open doors for mainstream adoption. Institutions Are Quietly Accumulating XRP Ripple is reportedly moving closer to a settlement with the SEC , which could remove one of the last hurdles for XRP’s full-scale adoption. The first-ever XRP spot ETF, XRP H11 , is already live in Brazil via Hashdex, showing that global institutional interest in XRP is already gaining serious traction. At the same time, liquidity is rising across markets. The Federal Reserve has now opened the door for banks to engage with crypto , and central banks are reportedly exploring crypto reserves. Governments and financial institutions are quietly preparing for a major shift—and XRP is at the center. Analyst: XRP to Hit $10, $20… and Beyond? Crypto expert BarriC says buying XRP now is like grabbing it in 2017 before the explosion . He predicts XRP will easily break through $3, $5, and then hit $10 to $20 as institutional money starts pouring in.

By 2028, the price is projected to reach $12.42 By 2031, FIL may reach $36.73 Filecoin is a decentralized storage network designed to securely and efficiently store humanity’s most important information. Launched by Protocol Labs in October 2020, it utilizes blockchain technology to create a peer-to-peer digital storage marketplace. Users can rent unused hard drive space to earn Filecoin tokens (FIL), the network’s native cryptocurrency. The system operates on a proof-of-replication and proof-of-spacetime consensus mechanism, ensuring that data is reliably stored over time and that storage providers hold the exact copies they claim. This approach incentivizes a robust and distributed network of storage providers, enhancing data retrieval speeds and security compared to traditional centralized servers. Filecoin aims to reduce the costs of storage services by leveraging the global surplus of storage capacity. As part of the broader Web3 ecosystem, it supports decentralized applications (dApps) and services requiring secure, decentralized data storage solutions, significantly advancing decentralized internet infrastructure.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dipped to 46.98, approaching neutral territory and indicating weakening bullish momentum. Meanwhile, the price has fallen below the middle Bollinger Band, suggesting a shift toward bearish pressure. Unless FIL regains support above the 20-day simple moving average near $2.87, it risks revisiting the lower Bollinger Band around $2.45. To resume upward momentum, the asset would need to reclaim and sustain levels above $3.00 with an RSI recovery above 50. Filecoin price analysis 4-hour chart analysis FIL/USD chart Image Source: TradingView Based on the 4-hour chart of Filecoin (FIL) on May 17, the asset is currently facing downward pressure near the $2.80 zone, slightly below the middle Bollinger Band, which now acts as a near-term resistance around $2.95. The MACD has turned bearish, with both the MACD line and signal line positioned in negative territory, indicating a weakening momentum. The Balance of Power remains flat at 0.02, suggesting a neutral control between bulls and bears. Should the price fail to reclaim $3.00, FIL may test support near $2.76 or even $2.64. Overall, caution prevails unless strong volume returns to push the price upward.

On the daily chart, FIL is positioned just below the middle Bollinger Band, with the RSI trending under 50, indicating neutral-to-bearish sentiment. The recent rejection near the upper band suggests resistance around $3.28 remains firm. The 4-hour chart confirms this weakness, with a bearish MACD crossover and decreasing histogram momentum. The Balance of Power is slightly positive, hinting at marginal buyer activity, but not convincingly strong. Unless bulls reclaim $3.00 decisively, FIL risks retesting lower support levels near $2.60.

Filecoin’s historic price sentiment Filecoin price history | CoinMarketCap Filecoin (FIL) started trading in December 2017, a short period after conducting its ICO. Trading started long before the Filecoin mainnet was released. Between December 2017 and May 2020, FIL traded below $30. Then, starting mid-May, the Filecoin price started rising, and the bull trend continued until 1st April 2021, when it hit its highest price of $237.24.

The regulator was initially expected to announce its ruling on May 7, 2025, but later disclosed the need to reevaluate regulatory concerns and a proposed rule change. “Accordingly, the Commission, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, designates June 17, 2025, as the date by which the Commission shall either approve or disapprove or institute proceedings to determine whether to disapprove the proposed rule change.” Sherry R. Haywood, the Assistant Secretary at the SEC, wrote in a recent release by the regulator. What to expect from the SEC in June According to Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, the delays in altcoin ETF approvals do not signal a potential disapproval. In fact, Seyffart remarked that these delays are “standard procedures.” As such, the analyst maintains an optimistic outlook for the months ahead. However, it bears mentioning that disapproval for one proposal might not extend to others. Meanwhile, a potential approval of Templeton’s proposal could have a major impact on the price of the XRP token, which is trading at $2.39 at report time. Asset Manager Franklin Templeton (BEN.N) filed a Form S-1 with the U.S. SEC to launch its XRP Spot-based ETF on March 11, 2025. As noted in the firm’s filing, the ETF, designed to track XRP’s price value, will provide price estimates in real-time, with an intraday value intended to be updated every 15 seconds throughout market hours. In 2024, Franklin Templeton’s total asset under management (AUM) was valued at $1.6 trillion, making the investment giant one of the largest in the world, with a market reach spanning across more than 160 countries. The firm’s XRP ETF filing is one of many recorded over the past months. In March, nine investment companies, including leading firms like ProShares, Bitwise, and 21 Shares, filed for an XRP Spot-based ETF with the SEC.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-17 15:54:44

The Teucrium 2x Long Daily XRP ETF, whose ticker symbol is XXRP, has accumulated over $106 million in assets since its approval in April. Most importantly, the fund has added assets in all weeks since its inception, with last week being its best. ETF.com data shows that it added $30.4 million in assets, a big increase from the $14.1 million it added a week earlier. XXRP ETF inflows data | Source: ETF The ongoing inflows are a sign that there is demand for XRP ETFs on Wall Street. Spot Ethereum ETFs have added just $2.5 billion in assets since September, while the 2X Solana ETF (SOLT) has only $30 million . SOLT was launched two months before the XXRP ETF. This view mirrors the JPMorgan forecast for Solana and XRP ETFs. In its report , the bank predicted that the two funds would attract $15 billion in inflows in the first year, with most of them going to XRP. The next important catalyst to watch is in June when the SEC will rule on the Franklin Templeton XRP ETF. It will likely delay the ETF approval again, and then it will be approved with those of companies like Bitwise and VanEck ahead of their Oct. 15 deadline.

For one, it is a more expensive fund to own because of its 1.89% expense ratio. Judging by the existing ETH and BTC ETFs, their expense ratios will be less than 0.50%. The ETF is also leveraged, allowing investors to achieve 2 times the daily returns of XRP. For example, it dropped by almost 3% on Friday as Ripple ( XRP ) fell by 1.5%.

After weeks of impressive gains, BTC is now consolidating in a tight range just below its all-time high, with buyers struggling to push the price into price discovery. This ongoing indecision has raised concerns among traders and analysts, who are closely watching for signs of either a breakout or a deeper retracement. Related Reading: Ethereum Multi-Year Consolidation Could Spark A Parabolic Move – Details Crypto analyst Daan offered a broader perspective on the situation, noting that Bitcoin initially surged in response to the recent tariff-related tensions, significantly outperforming equities in the process. However, as trade uncertainty began to ease and traditional markets regained momentum, Bitcoin lost steam and failed to follow through. While stocks continued their uptrend, BTC stalled—an unusual divergence that suggests caution may be creeping back into the crypto space. With the price now hovering around the $103K mark and key resistance near $105K remaining untouched, bulls must act decisively to reclaim control. A failure to do so could trigger a larger correction, especially if macro conditions shift or equity markets show renewed weakness. For now, all eyes are on the range — and which side breaks first. Bitcoin Bulls Eye Breakout But Caution Grows Near Resistance Bitcoin is just 5% away from its all-time high of around $109,000, trading near $103K as bulls attempt to reclaim momentum. After weeks of strong upward movement and consolidation above key levels, many analysts believe BTC is preparing for a decisive breakout. If price can clear the $105K resistance, it could trigger a new leg into price discovery and signal the start of a powerful bull phase. However, selling pressure at current levels remains strong. Bitcoin has struggled to break higher, and some traders see this consolidation as a sign of potential exhaustion. Daan offered insights on the recent behavior, noting that BTC surged sharply following the tariff-related macro drama, outperforming equities in the process. Yet, as some trade uncertainty faded, stocks kept climbing while BTC stalled near resistance. Daan considers $90K his “line in the sand” for long-term spot exposure. If Bitcoin were to drop below that mark, it would suggest a structural breakdown that hasn’t occurred during this cycle. For now, he remains cautiously bullish while BTC stays above that level, but admits the risk-reward was more attractive when BTC was 20–30% cheaper. He also warns that if equities correct after their aggressive rallies—many stocks have surged 30–50% in a single month—it could drag Bitcoin lower in a short-term flush. With BTC showing relative weakness near resistance, the next move will be critical for confirming either continued upside or the start of a broader pullback. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Accumulate 1 Billion DOGE In A Month: Fueling Price Surge Speculation Tight 4H Range Signals Imminent Price Breakout The 4-hour chart shows Bitcoin consolidating tightly between $105,700 resistance and $100,700 support, creating a narrow range that suggests a strong move is imminent. Price has been ranging sideways for several days, with multiple failed breakout attempts above $103,600. This level continues to act as a key barrier for bulls. Notably, Bitcoin remains above both the 200 EMA ($96,121) and the 200 SMA ($94,622), reinforcing the medium-term bullish structure. Momentum is neutral in the short term, as shown by the indecisive price action and declining volume. However, the trend remains intact as long as BTC holds above $100,000 — the psychological and technical line in the sand. If price breaks above $103,600 with volume, it could trigger a move toward the $105,000–$109,000 range and initiate a push into price discovery. On the other hand, failure to hold this support zone could open the door for a quick flush to retest the $98,000–$96,000 area, where the moving averages align.

The false X post sent the price of Bitcoin briefly surging at the time. SEC Hacker Jailed Eric Council Jr., a resident of Athens, Alabama, got unauthorized access to the SEC’s Twitter (aka X) account in early January 2024 and tweeted a bogus statement about the greenlighting of Bitcoin ETFs that briefly spiked the price of the bellwether crypto by over $1,000 within minutes. Prosecutors claimed that the 26-year-old conspired with others to take control of the account and post, “Today the SEC grants approval for Bitcoin ETFs for listing on all registered national securities exchanges.” Bitcoin, however, fell by over $2,000 shortly after former SEC chairman Gary Gensler confirmed that the tweet was false and that the agency’s account was compromised. Under a search warrant, the Federal Bureau of Investigation found a laptop where Council lived that contained internet searches for phrases like, “How can I know for sure if I am being investigated by the FBI?” and “What are some signs that the FBI is after you?” Ironically, the SEC ended up greenlighting the first batch of spot Bitcoin ETFs just a day after the hack, allowing the highly-awaited products to be traded in the United States. Council was eventually arrested in October 2024. In February, he pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit aggravated identity theft and access device fraud. In a statement, interim US Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Ferris Pirro said Council’s actions hurt the integrity of the markets. Pirro was tapped by President Donald Trump last week to head that office in D.C. “Schemes of this nature threaten the health and integrity of our market system,” Pirro posited. “SIM swap schemes threaten the financial security of average citizens, financial institutions, and government agencies. Don’t fool yourself into thinking you can’t be caught. You will be caught, prosecuted, and will pay the price for the damage your actions create.” In addition to Council’s prison term, he was ordered to forfeit $50,000 in proceeds from his offenses and will serve 36 months of supervised release, with restrictions on accessing the dark web and participating in identity-related crimes.",Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Ethereum News,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-17 16:00:33

According to a report by the market analytics platform CryptoQuant, the relative price of ether (ETH) compared to bitcoin (BTC) may have seen the bottom for this cycle. Previously, such low levels have been followed by periods where ETH significantly outperformed BTC, triggering a broader altcoin rally. ETH Recovers From Undervalued Zone In the last seven days, the ETH/BTC price ratio has surged 38% from its lowest level since January 2020. The current price ratio has been historically associated with ETH price bottoms, which have preceded altseasons. Still, the metric needs to rally above its 365-day moving average before ETH can record a new and sustainable leg against BTC. To substantiate the possibility of a strong mean-reversion potential, CryptoQuant pointed out that ETH recently dipped into an extreme undervalued zone relative to BTC. This was evident in the ETH/BTC Market Value to Realized Value ratio, which plunged to its lowest level for the first time since 2019. Similar cases of an MVRV ratio dip recorded in 2017, 2018, and 2019 were followed by periods where ETH outperformed BTC. ETH Sees Bullish Signals Recently, ether’s price has been on a positive trajectory, and this performance has coincided with higher spot trading volume relative to BTC. The ratio of ether’s spot trading volume relative to BTC rose last week to 0.89, a level not seen since August 2024. This signalled that market participants increased their exposure to ETH compared to Bitcoin. CryptoQuant mentioned that traders’ increased exposure to ETH compared to BTC has also happened from 2019 to 2021, during which ETH outperformed BTC by 4x. Ether’s spot trading volume has also begun to grow faster than bitcoin’s, indicating higher demand for the second-largest crypto asset. Furthermore, investors also favor ETH through their allocations to exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Higher ETH purchases have triggered a spike in the ETF holdings ratio since late April. “The growing ETH allocation likely reflects expectations of relative outperformance, possibly driven by catalysts such as recent scaling upgrades or a more favorable macro environment,” CryptoQuant explained. Additionally, ETH is seeing lower sell pressure relative to BTC, as seen in exchange inflow data. The exchange inflow ratio has fallen to its lowest level since 2020, indicating that ETH is facing significantly lower selling pressure than BTC. This has always been a bullish signal for ETH, supporting further gains for the cryptocurrency.

In a recent X post, Xaif announced that prominent VPN companies are integrating XRP payments, reflecting the cryptocurrency’s increasing utility and mainstream adoption. VPN Providers Welcoming XRP Several well-known VPN providers have started accepting XRP as a payment method, leveraging platforms like CoinGate to facilitate seamless cryptocurrency transactions. The VPN sector’s move to digital payments is fueled by increasing demand from users who prioritize privacy and value the security and anonymity provided by cryptocurrencies. According to Xaif, the leading VPN providers currently accepting XRP include NordVPN, Surfshark, and CactusVPN. BREAKING: $XRP Getting Bigger!

Drake estimated that such an attack on Bitcoin could cost around $10 billion, while he noted that a similar attack on Ethereum would be much more costly thanks to its Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism. In order to attack the Ethereum network, Drake said it would be necessary to seize more than 50% of the staked ETH, which is currently worth approximately $44.8 billion, and that this figure could increase further with market fluctuations. Drake’s comments are in line with the notable posts made by Grant Hummer, co-founder of Ethereum-focused marketing and product firm Etherealize, on the X platform. Related News: Bitcoin is Stuck Between Two Critical Points: Here Are the Key Areas That Will Determine Its Fate Hummer used the following expressions in his post: “With all due respect, BTC is completely drained by its security budget. A 51% attack on BTC today would cost just $8 billion. When that number drops to $2 billion (i.e. when BTC’s security market cap is 0.1% of asset market cap), such an attack becomes almost certain. This will become a visible reality in the next decade. ETH is the only truly decentralized crypto asset that can become the internet’s store of value (SoV).” Hummer said that Ethereum's higher security cost is also an advantage, and continued: “Securing your data with a global decentralized network with thousands of validators and around $100 billion in staked security is certainly more expensive compared to the chains a few VCs run on AWS. But I know which one I prefer for critical data.” *This is not investment advice.

Bitcoin dropped below $103,000 for the first time in days, while popular tokens like Pepe, Shiba Inu, Pi Network, and Dogwifhat (WIF) plunged by double digits. This article explores why these tokens dropped. Altcoins dropped as Bitcoin price stalled The main reason why altcoins like Pepe, Shiba Inu, Pi Network, and WIF prices have crashed is that Bitcoin has found substantial resistance at the $105,900 level. After rising to that level on May 12, the coin has remained in a tight range as its volume has slumped. Altcoins often move in the same direction as Bitcoin. Most of them rally when the Bitcoin price is pointing upwards, and fall when it is either dropping or stalling. However, there are signs that the ongoing Bitcoin price consolidation is calm before the storm, before it bounces back soon. First, the chart below shows that volume of Bitcoin has continued moving downwards. In theory, this is usually a bearish sign. However, in practice, Bitcoin tends to rebound when the volume in the spot and futures market is falling. Second, this chart shows that Bitcoin has formed two unique bullish chart patterns that will push it higher in the coming weeks. It has formed a bullish pennant pattern that is shown in black in the chart below. A bullish pennant has a flagpole-like pattern and a symmetrical triangle. In most cases, it normally breaks out when the two lines of the triangle are nearing their confluence level. Bitcoin has also slowly formed a cup-and-handle pattern whose upper side is at $108,022. This cup has a depth of about 32%, meaning that the coin will eventually surge to over $140,000. The caveat of all this is that the C&H pattern takes a long time to form and complete. Bitcoin price chart | Source: TradingView Read more: Will a crypto bull run happen? 4 altcoins to buy if it does Altcoins crashed because of profit-taking Altcoins like Pi Network, Dogwifhat, Shiba Inu, and Pepe also crashed because of profit-taking. That’s because most of these coins were up sharply from their April lows. Pi Network price surged by over 300% from its lowest point in April and its highest level last week. Shiba Inu price jumped by over 72%, while Pepe Coin was up by over 189% in the same period. It is common for cryptocurrencies and other assets to pull back after going through a strong rally, especially in a short period of time. This explains why many of these tokens dropped despite no negative headline about them. The only coin in this list that had a major issue was Pi Network , whose token crashed after the developers unveiled the Pi Network Ventures, a fund that will invest in technology startups using its technology. While a venture fund is a step in the right direction, analysts believe that Pi is a high-risk asset. For one, it is one of the most centralized cryptocurrencies in the industry.

Retailleau listed various ways the government would respond, so that investors in France could feel safe without being targeted by criminals. The list includes checkups by police officers at the homes of crypto investors, special briefings for family members of crypto holders by police tactical units, and a special phone number for crypto investors to ring when they feel unsafe. Retailleau said that the government will stop these violent acts, as it would have stopped jewellery or bank thefts many years ago. Crypto investors will now have extra security after the sector was rocked by horrific scenes of criminals targeting family members of wealthy crypto holders. The French government will provide numerous new protections so crypto investors can feel safe. The blockchain industry brings wealth and jobs to the French nation. French authorities are concerned that entrepreneurs may choose to leave the country if they can’t operate their businesses without fearing for their lives. The French government will bring in a variety of measures to counter the growing threat of violence against crypto investors. Retailleau, moreover, will introduce measures straight away to prevent the situation from becoming worse. Retailleau said that short- and long-term measures will be introduced to stop repeat attacks. Law enforcement will further be trained in a new “anti crypto asset laundering” program, encompassing the growing threat of crypto kidnappings. Masked men could be seen dragging the daughter of a crypto entrepreneur into a van on Tuesday. The woman’s father is Pierre Noizat, CEO and founder of Bitcoin exchange Paymium. The woman evaded their advances and held onto her husband while yelling for assistance. A witness nearby filmed the surreal event. A shopkeeper could then be seen running after the attackers with a red fire extinguisher, scaring the kidnappers away and even throwing the fire extinguisher at their car as the attackers scampered back inside their van. Pierre Noizat spoke with journalists about the incident, saying that his son-in-law had sustained serious injuries that required stitches. Noizat criticised the government for not doing enough to protect crypto investors. He further lamented that other crypto investors will suffer similar experiences if the government doesn’t do something to prevent the violence from spreading. The kidnapping occurred in the 11th arrondissement of Paris. The woman was accompanied by her husband and their child. The attack happened in the morning within an affluent community. Noizat praised his son-in-law for protecting his daughter and also the shopkeeper for heroically chasing away the kidnappers with a fire extinguisher. The kidnappers beat the husband with a blunt object. They were most likely trying to sever ties between the woman and man so that they could kidnap the daughter and extort her father for cryptocurrency. However, the husband fought back and sustained injuries during the process. Both the woman and her child also suffered injuries during the struggle and had to be taken to the hospital after the incident. Noizat was very impressed with the onlookers who intervened even though their lives were possibly in danger. Noizat thanked the shopkeeper who wielded a fire extinguisher, saying his actions were courageous. On May 3, a wealthy crypto holder was released from the trunk of a car after being tortured and doused with gasoline. He was kidnapped in the 14th arrondissement in Paris at 10:30 am. Four kidnappers took him to Essonne, 20 km from Paris, where they cut off his finger so that his family would pay the $4 million ransom. The kidnappings seem to have a similar pattern and could be connected. French authorities have vowed to do something about the spate of abductions because the situation is escalating rapidly.",Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-17 16:16:52

Ripple and the SEC had filed a joint motion earlier this month for an “indicative ruling” to see whether District Judge Analisa Torres would be open to vacating the firm’s previously assigned $125 million civil penalty and reducing it to $50 million. The SEC has been walking back numerous crypto enforcement actions since Donald Trump became president and Gary Gensler left as chair. Torres, however, says both parties “fail to address the heavy burden they must overcome to vacate the injunction and substantially reduce the civil penalty.” Writes the judge, “Relief from judgment under Rule 60 is granted ‘only upon a showing of exceptional circumstances’… The parties have made no effort to satisfy that burden here; their request does not even mention the rule. Accordingly, if jurisdiction were restored to this court, the court would deny the parties’ motion as procedurally improper.” The SEC first sued the San Francisco-based payments firm in late 2020 for allegedly selling XRP as an unregistered security. In 2023, Torres ruled that Ripple’s automated, open-market sales of XRP did not constitute security offerings, contrary to what the SEC alleged. The judge did, however, side with the SEC’s claim that Ripple’s sales of XRP directly to institutional buyers were securities offerings. Last August, Torres slapped Ripple with a $125 million civil penalty. Both the firm and the SEC appealed that number.

Yet, XRP and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are stealing the spotlight, with analysts predicting both could soar to $20. XRP’s failed bearish pattern has unleashed bullish momentum, while Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is drawing fervent investor demand in its phase 4 presale, raising $8,500,000 with over 476 million tokens sold to 10,000 holders. These crypto coins are dominating crypto news today, promising outsized returns. As the crypto market heats up, here’s why XRP and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are the best cryptos to buy now. Cardano’s steady climb Cardano (ADA) is gaining traction, trading at $0.83 with a $30 billion market cap. Its recent Brave wallet integration opens doors to millions, boosting its appeal as a top crypto. Analysts see a path to $3 in 2025, driven by side-chain projects like Midgard and BitcoinOS. A $5 target looms if altcoin season ignites. However, Cardano lags behind peers like Ethereum in total value locked, tempering its shine. Investors eyeing the best cryptocurrency to invest in may find Cardano solid but not the brightest star. Meanwhile, XRP’s explosive potential demands attention. XRP’s bullish breakout XRP is charging past resistance, climbing above $2.50 after a failed head-and-shoulders breakdown. Trading volumes are spiking, signaling robust trader confidence. CoinDesk’s AI-assisted analysis predicts $2.85 by June, with some analysts eyeing $3.40 or even $15. XRP’s resilience above its 200-day moving average during April’s crypto crash underscores its strength. As a top crypto to buy, XRP benefits from Ripple’s cross-border transaction utility. Its $20 potential overshadows Cardano’s slower climb, making it a prime pick for those asking what crypto to invest in. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), however, offers even fiercer upside. Mutuum Finance’s presale frenzy Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is igniting investor fervor in its phase 4 presale, priced at $0.025, up from $0.01 in phase 1. With 80% of phase 4 filled, phase 5 will bring a 20% price jump to $0.03, yielding a 20% gain for current buyers. The project has raised $8,500,000, with 476 million tokens sold to 10,000 holders. Its lending model enables passive income through mtTokens, which accrue interest. A $0.06 listing price promises a 140% return, while analysts predict a $2 post-launch target, delivering a 7,900% ROI. This makes Mutuum Finance a top cryptocurrency for 2025. Security and rewards boost MUTM The Mutuum Finance team is finalizing a Certik smart contract audit, with results soon to be announced on socials, bolstering investor trust. A newly launched dashboard features a leaderboard rewarding the top 50 holders with bonus tokens, spurring competition. The buy-and-distribute system drives constant demand, stabilizing prices. Unlike XRP’s reliance on market sentiment, Mutuum Finance’s utility in DeFi lending positions it as the best crypto to invest in for long-term gains. As phase 4 nears completion, the urgency to buy now intensifies, cementing its status as a new crypto coin to watch. Why MUTM outshines Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands apart in the crypto market. Its overcollateralized lending reduces risk, while dynamic interest rates attract diverse investors. The $100,000 giveaway for presale participants adds allure, unlike Cardano’s slower ecosystem growth. XRP’s momentum is strong, but Mutuum Finance’s structured tokenomics and presale success signal unmatched potential. As crypto prices rise, MUTM’s $20 target feels within reach. Investors seeking the next crypto to hit $1 should act fast, as phase 4’s low price won’t last. This is the cheapest cryptocurrency with the highest upside. XRP and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are outpacing Cardano’s $5 ambition, with $20 targets in sight. XRP’s technical breakout and Mutuum Finance’s presale fervor make them the best cryptos to buy now. Don’t miss Mutuum Finance’s phase 4 before prices climb.

WLFI has partnered with Chainlink and its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) to unlock new possibilities for its fast-growing stablecoin, USD1. This upgrade could make USD1 one of the most important stablecoins in decentralized finance. USD1 Now Works Across Blockchains With Chainlink’s Help USD1 was launched only a few months ago, but it already has a market value of over $2 billion , which puts it among the top five stablecoins. Before now, it worked only on the Ethereum (ETH) and BNB Chain blockchain networks. However, with Chainlink’s CCIP, USD1 can move safely between these blockchains. This means more users and developers can now use the stablecoin without being limited to one blockchain. Notably, WLFI is not stopping with Ethereum and BNB Chain. The crypto project leaders are planning to add USD1 to more networks soon. Cross-chain transfers are seen as risky because many bridges lack strong security. Reports show over $3 billion has been stolen through unsafe bridges recently. However, Chainlink’s CCIP aims to solve this problem. The platform is designed to help users move assets safely and with more trust. Chainlink Could Boost WLFI USD1 Market Value Chainlink is known for providing safe and reliable services in the crypto industry. Many projects use their tools for price data and security. Now, WLFI, backed by DWF Labs, is using Chainlink’s CCIP to strengthen and secure USD1. This will help the stablecoin reach more users and attract big investors. Right now, USD1’s market value is still lower than that of top stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and USDC, which are worth about $151 billion and $60.6 billion, respectively. However, this new upgrade allowed USD1’s market cap to grow faster. Since it can now work on more blockchains, more developers and users can build with it and use it in DeFi apps, giving USD1 a bigger chance to expand in the market. WLFI and Chainlink have worked together before, providing price data for WLFI’s Aave v3 setup. This new upgrade is a more significant step, making USD1 ready for use by large companies and financial firms. At the same time, WLFI plans to introduce a USD1 airdrop to reward early users and test the network’s ability to handle high traffic. Impressively, 99.96% of users have supported the idea. Clear Regulation Could Help Stablecoins Grow In the U.S., Congress discusses how to regulate crypto bills like the GENIUS Act. This new law, introduced by Senator Bill Hagerty, aims to boost stablecoin adoption by giving it legal support. Recently, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has called for fair crypto rules . Armstrong says the current stablecoin bills are unfair and could hurt crypto innovation.

The meeting comes after over $193 billion worth of assets have been staked on proof-of-stake (PoS) chains, yet U.S. regulation around staking remains unclear. Legal Uncertainty Clouds U.S. Staking Market The SEC, in its previous leadership, targeted the big players like Kraken, Coinbase, and Consensys for their staking products. However, with the current crypto-friendly administration, some of these actions have since been withdrawn. However, the agency has declined to make a definitive statement on non-custodial staking, keeping the industry in limbo. Everstake: Staking Is Not a Securities Transaction Everstake told regulators that its model allows users to maintain full ownership of their tokens, delegating validation rights but not ownership. “Staking is not a financial instrument or security transaction, but rather a technical process. similar to an oracle in a database,” said Everstake founder Sergii Vasylchuk. Letter to SEC Calls for Policy Clarity Everstake submitted a formal letter to the SEC on April 8, 2025, responding to Commissioner Hester Peirce’s call for stakeholder input. The company explained in its letter why non-custodial staking should not be subject to securities laws. Users: Retain ownership of assets Do not commingle funds Are not promised profits from a managing entity Receive rewards from algorithms at the network level Howey Test Argument Everstake argued that non-custodial staking satisfies all four prongs of the Howey test for securities status. The firm compared its model to proof-of-work mining, which has not been treated as a securities activity by the SEC. Chief Legal Officer Margaret Rosenfeld in a statement that applying securities law to staking would “undermine the decentralized model and risk chilling innovation.” Industry Pushes for Broader Regulatory Guidance In a second letter on April 30, nearly 30 crypto advocacy groups, led by the Crypto Council for Innovation, also urged the SEC to bring clarity to rules for crypto staking. While the SEC has made no assurances of comprehensive guidelines, it continues to engage with stakeholders from across the crypto ecosystem, including ETF and infrastructure providers. Everstake’s activities are symbolic of the growing demand for a definitive, functional regulatory environment for staking models that are consistent with the technical reality of decentralized networks.",Blockchain|Regulation,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-05-17 16:39:18

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-says-xrp-is-about-to-go-parabolic-heres-why/,"XRP has once again captured the attention of crypto enthusiasts and analysts alike, with speculation mounting about a potential parabolic surge. According to a recent post by STEPH IS CRYPTO on X, XRP is poised for a significant breakout , cautioning investors not to be misled by short-term market fluctuations. This projection has sparked renewed excitement among the XRP community, with many eager to understand the factors driving this prediction. #XRP is about to go parabolic! Don't get fooled here! pic.twitter.com/Y8nBXfPJFO — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) May 16, 2025 Bullish Technical Indicators Signal a Surge One of the primary reasons behind the bullish outlook on XRP is the emergence of several key technical patterns. Analysts have pointed to the formation of a cup-and-handle pattern on XRP’s four-hour chart. Typically, this pattern is considered a strong bullish indicator, often signaling the continuation of an uptrend. Technical analyst Ali Martinez predicts XRP could hit $3.35 if the pattern completes. This projection is based on historical data showing that such formations often precede sharp price increases. Another respected analyst, JD, highlighted a symmetrical triangle pattern forming on XRP’s chart. This pattern and a bullish MACD crossover suggest a breakout is likely. The MACD, known for signaling trend reversals, turning positive is a strong indicator of growing bullish momentum. With XRP maintaining support levels despite broader market volatility, these technical signals boost investor confidence in a potential upward trajectory. Whale Activity: A Key Market Driver Whale movements have historically had a major impact on cryptocurrency prices, and XRP is no exception. Recently, on-chain data revealed that a whale transferred approximately 29.5 million XRP (valued at over $64 million) to Coinbase. Such large-scale transactions are often seen as an indication of institutional interest or preparations for significant trading activity. Similar movements have preceded price surges, as whales tend to position themselves before substantial market shifts. Moreover, data from Whale Alert indicated that wallets holding between 10 million and 100 million XRP have accumulated over 200 million tokens within the past week. This accumulation phase suggests that major investors are positioning themselves for a potential rally, reflecting growing confidence in XRP’s long-term prospects. Such concentrated buying activity is often a precursor to upward price movements, as it reduces the supply available on the market, creating upward pressure. Market Sentiment and Community Optimism The excitement surrounding XRP’s potential parabolic move is based on technical analysis and the broader market sentiment. Social media engagement regarding XRP has significantly increased, with many in the crypto community speculating that the upcoming developments could catalyze a major price movement. This positive sentiment is reflected in trading volumes, which have surged significantly across major exchanges, indicating that retail and institutional investors are actively accumulating. Recent regulatory advancements have further boosted confidence. XRP’s legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has seen favorable developments. This legal clarity has revitalized investor confidence, as it reduces the regulatory risk that has long overshadowed the asset. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Historical Parallels: Learning from the Past XRP has shown a pattern of parabolic price movements in past bull cycles, particularly during the 2017 rally, when it surged from fractions of a cent to over $3 within a few months. Analysts believe that the current market conditions mirror some aspects of that period, including heightened retail interest, increased whale accumulation, and the emergence of bullish chart patterns. XRP’s previous surge was driven by its growing use in cross-border payments and strategic partnerships with financial institutions. Today, with growing adoption in remittance corridors and the upcoming establishment of XRP futures by CME Group , the token is once again positioned at the intersection of mainstream finance and blockchain technology. This strategic positioning could catalyze another parabolic move, particularly as the broader crypto market regains bullish momentum. Caution Amid Optimism While the current indicators suggest a bullish breakout, it is essential to approach these predictions with a balanced perspective. Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile, and market sentiment can change rapidly. Analysts like STEPH IS CRYPTO have warned that despite the positive outlook, investors should not be fooled by short-term price swings. Diversifying investments and maintaining a risk management strategy is crucial, especially given XRP’s history of sharp corrections following bullish rallies. A perfect storm of technicals, whale activity, and positive market sentiment fuels XRP’s potential for a sharp price surge . However, investors should remain vigilant and conduct thorough research before making decisions. As XRP continues to navigate the volatile crypto landscape, its potential breakout could significantly shape its future trajectory, reaffirming its status as one of the most closely watched assets in the digital currency space.

This allows an examination of his financial records as federal prosecutors investigate his role in the LIBRA memecoin scandal. Federal Judge Maria Servini made the order on May 16, over three months after the ill-fated X post from Milei. The President promoted the LIBRA memecoin in February, causing the price to soar significantly before it crashed due to a sell-off by insiders. The crash of the LIBRA token led to massive losses for investors, with the token market cap reaching a peak of $4.5 billion. While Milei deleted the post and denies seeing any gains from promoting the token, judicial investigations and legislative inquiries have continued in Argentina. According to local media outlet Pagina 12, the judge’s order affected the President’s sister, Karina Milei, Argentina’s secretary general, and three other associates. In the letter addressed to the Central Bank of the Argentine Republic (BCRA), Servini asked for a report on all banks operating or operating an account for the President, his sister, and the other associates involved. Per media reports, the Central Bank is expected to provide information from 2023 till the present, which will form part of a confidential file on the President as investigations continue. Although President Milei has denied any foul play in the matter, he is currently facing civil and criminal charges for his role in promoting the memecoin. Argentina Court freezes accounts of Milei associates Meanwhile, the court has also ordered the freezing the accounts of three associates linked to the presidents. The three are Mauricio Novelli, a businessman with crypto ties, Manuel Terrones Godoy, a founding partner of Tech Forum, and Sergio Morales, a former advisor of the National Securities Commission. According to reports, Noveli is the connection between Milei and one of LIBRA’s creators, Hayden Davis. Milei, his sister, and the three associates are already facing a civil lawsuit from victims of the incidents. Interestingly, surveillance footage has surfaced showing Novelli’s mother, Maria Pia Novelli, and sister, Maria Alicia Rafaele, taking money from safes belonging to the businessman in a Banco Galicia branch in Buenos Aires on the next business day after President Milei promoted the token. Experts report noted that the two entered the bank with empty bags and left almost an hour later with bags that appeared filled with money. Novelli had hired ten safety deposit boxes at the bank ten days before the Milei post. Milei could face criminal prosecution if found wanting Meanwhile, the outcome of the investigation could determine whether Milei would be prosecuted, given that criminal charges have been filed against him. Although the President of Argentina has insisted that he promoted it in good faith and has nothing to hide, he has already missed the virtual mediation hearing in the civil lawsuit. Civil organizations and opposition leaders have also been calling for his impeachment. Some of those opposition lawmakers have also asked for an independent inquiry by the parliament to determine whether the President’s actions constitute abuse of office and market manipulation. However, there are concerns that the investigations may not yield any result or justice for the victims, given that three months have already passed with no clear resolutions on the matter. Many believe that Milei’s influence as President could hamper any attempt to prosecute the case. Interestingly, while the President and several associates came under fire, one of the major figures in the incident, Hayden Davis, appears to have escaped any form of investigation. Davis, also associated with other memecoins, including MELANIA, has been relatively quiet since the incident. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

According to crypto analyst Henry, “With Shibarium adoption growing and aggressive token burns underway, the fundamentals are aligning for a potential breakout. There is a huge pump incoming which is going to break all the past levels ATH and will be atleast 790%.” If this analysis sees the light of day, Shiba Inu is destined for the $0.001 zone. Already enjoying a monthly surge of 29% to post a price of $0.00015, Shiba Inu has been witnessing a notable hodling culture, given that SHIB holdings recently dropped to 1.2 billion from 7 billion on crypto exchanges. This is a welcome move in the SHIB ecosystem because it will decrease selling pressure since coins are mostly held on exchanges for liquidation purposes. Shibarium Steals the Show According to Shibariumscan data, Shiba Inu ’s Layer 2 network, Shibarium, continues to be the talk of the crypto token after recently breaching the 11 million block mark. Currently at 11,014,000, this block milestone shows heightened activity and user base within the SHIB ecosystem. Known for its efficiency, scalability, and speed, Shibarium continues to boost Shiba Inu’s utility, recently processing more than 1 billion transactions. Therefore, Shibarium is laying the groundwork for SHIB’s increased adoption and future developments. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu’s whale activity went through the roof last month after accumulating more than 1.4 trillion SHIB tokens in just a week.",Cryptocurrency|News|SHIB|SHIBA INU,EN,0,0,MARKET|SHIB|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-17 16:53:05

In 2028, Ethereum is anticipated to trade between $16,051 and $18,518, with an average expected price of $16,492. In 2031, ETH could trade between $48,883 and $58,524 with an average price of $50,590. The Ethereum network, launched in 2015, is a decentralized platform that enables developers to create smart contracts and dApps without intermediaries, enhancing security. The Ethereum blockchain is accessible to everyone and built to support scalability, programmability, security, and decentralization, allowing for the creation of secure digital technology. Its native digital currency, ether (ETH), and smart contracts have attracted investors’ recognition and interest, while developers appreciate its utility in developing blockchain and decentralized finance applications. It also helps traders to trade Ethereum more easily So, what can traders and investors expect in the coming months and years? “Is ETH likely to go up? What will ETH be worth in 5 years?” Let’s get into the details by exploring Ethereum’s price predictions from 2025 through 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ethereum Token ETH Price $2,476 Market Cap $298.93B Trading Volume (24h) $27.43B Circulating Supply 120.7M ETH All-time High $4,891.70 on Nov 16, 2021 All-time Low $0.4209 on Oct 21, 2015 24-hour High $2,603.86 24-hour Low $2,449.07 Ethereum price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 17.61% 50-day SMA $ 1,896.39 200-day SMA $ 2,517.59 Sentiment Bearish Fear and Greed Index 52 (Neutral) Green days 17/30 (57%) Ethereum price analysis ETH/USD 1-day chart ETH/USD 1-day chart Based on the 1-day chart on May 17, Ethereum (ETH) recently experienced a robust rally but now shows signs of a short-term cooldown. Price action has pulled back from the upper Bollinger Band at $2,867.07 and is approaching the mid-band, suggesting weakening upward momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains elevated at 70.87 but is beginning to curve downward, indicating a potential shift from overbought conditions. If price holds above the $2,300 support zone, bulls may attempt a recovery. However, a drop below this level could invite further bearish pressure toward the $2,150 range. Traders should watch for consolidation or a deeper correction. ETH/USD 4-hour chart analysis ETH/USD 4-hour price chart Based on the 4-hour chart on May 17, Ethereum (ETH) is currently consolidating after a strong upward move, with prices hovering near the middle Bollinger Band at $2,561.72. The upper band at $2,652.61 acts as short-term resistance, while the lower band at $2,470.83 provides nearby support. The MACD shows a bearish crossover, with the signal line overtaking the MACD line and histogram momentum declining, indicating cooling momentum. Balance of Power is neutral at 0.04, suggesting indecision between buyers and sellers. If ETH fails to reclaim $2,600 with strong volume, it may test support around $2,450. Caution is warranted for traders anticipating breakout continuation.

Based on the 4-hour and 1-day Ethereum (ETH) charts, ETH is experiencing a pullback following its recent surge toward $2,867. The 1-day RSI reading of 67.56 suggests that the asset was recently overbought and is now correcting. The Bollinger Bands indicate heightened volatility, with price retreating from the upper band near $2,867 and moving toward the midline around $2,158. On the 4-hour chart, MACD shows bearish momentum with a negative crossover, while the Balance of Power remains neutral. Together, these signals suggest consolidation or a minor decline in the near term, unless ETH reclaims $2,600 with strong bullish confirmation. Is ETH a good investment? Ethereum is the largest DeFi hub with a vibrant layer-two ecosystem in the crypto market. The blockchain constantly develops, making it a go-to choice for many Web3 developers. ETH, its native token, shows promise, and the possibility of an Ethereum ETF approval makes it favorable for day traders. Over the long term, explore our price predictions. However, the opinions expressed are not investment advice; traders should consider researching before investing. What is a realistic price for Ethereum in 2025? The realistic price for Ethereum in 2025 is around $5,559 at the maximum. What will 1 Ethereum be worth in 2030? One Ethereum is expected to be worth $38,876, maximum in 2030. How high can ETH realistically go? Ethereum’s price potential depends on multiple factors, including market trends, institutional adoption, network upgrades, and macroeconomic conditions. Realistically, ETH could reach $5,000 to $7,000 in the next bullish cycle if demand increases and Ethereum’s Layer 2 solutions and scalability improvements boost adoption. If institutional interest strengthens, ETH may push past $10,000 over the long term, especially if Ethereum remains the dominant smart contract platform. However, volatility remains a key risk, with price corrections likely along the way. Regulatory clarity and Ethereum’s shift to proof-of-stake (PoS) efficiency could also positively influence its long-term valuation. Will ETH reach $10,000? Ethereum is projected to exceed $12,359 as early as 2027, with its potential low starting at $10,649. Will ETH reach $25,000? Ethereum is predicted to surpass the $25,000 level by 2029 and reach a potential high of $27,327. This optimistic outlook is based on Ethereum’s ongoing development, network security, and increasing adoption. However, cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, so long-term projections should be cautiously approached. Will ETH reach $40,000? Based on our analysis, Ethereum will likely reach the $40,000 mark. The highest expected price is around $58,525 in 2031. Does Ethereum have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but ETH is trading above its average price of the last two years. However, a positive outbreak can be expected. The ETH/USD pair is expected to reach the $58,525 mark by 2031, so holding it longer can be beneficial.

Ozak AI’s Rise Challenges Classic Altcoins appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Litecoin (LTC) has long held its place as a reliable, fast, and affordable alternative to Bitcoin. Known as the “digital silver” to Bitcoin’s gold, LTC boasts over a decade of operational stability and consistent updates. As markets prepare for another bullish wave in 2025, many investors are eyeing Litecoin’s potential to return to its all-time high—or even push beyond it. However, a new project with explosive growth potential has emerged: Ozak AI , a presale-stage cryptocurrency project combining artificial intelligence with decentralised infrastructure. With over $1 million raised and a token price of just $0.003, analysts suggest Ozak AI could outperform traditional names like Litecoin in the next cycle. Litecoin Price Prediction 2025: Aiming for $300 Litecoin currently trades between $90–$100 range and has shown a strong ancient correlation with broader Bitcoin actions. Analysts have set near-term support levels around $75, in which bulls are predicted to guard price dips, even as key resistance is placed close to $120, which LTC needs to smash to re-establish upward momentum. If bullish momentum persists and Litecoin benefits from Bitcoin tailwinds, a long-term target of $300 by 2025 is possible—though it might require sustained market enthusiasm and macroeconomic tailwinds. That said, Litecoin’s growth curve has slowed. It no longer holds the innovation spotlight in the way newer smart contract platforms and AI-integrated projects do. While it may double or triple from current prices, many investors are beginning to question whether these returns justify the wait—especially when far greater upside might lie in lower-cap assets.

These coins have added over $38 billion in assets since they started the year with $240 billion. Tether ( USDT ) boasts a market cap jumping to over $151 billion, giving it a dominance of 62%. It is followed by USD Coin ( USDC ), which has $60.4 billion in assets, and Ethena USDe ( USDe ) with almost $5 billion. The recently launched USD1 by President Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial has gained over $2.1 billion in assets. Most of these funds are likely tied to MGX’s $2 billion investment in Binance, the biggest crypto exchange in the industry. Other notable stablecoins are Ripple USD ( RLUSD ) and PayPal’s PYUSD, which have accumulated assets of $900 million and $313 million, respectively.

Stablecoin supply | Source: Visa Data compiled by Visa shows that more people are using stablecoins in their daily transactions today. Over 192.2 million unique sending addresses have transacted in the last 12 months, while 242.7 million have received stablecoins. The total active unique addresses jumped to 250 million. All this has pushed the total transaction count to 5.8 billion and the transaction volume to $33.6 trillion. Stablecoins have become highly popular because of their lower costs compared to traditional methods. For example, sending $1,000 to a user through PayPal attracts a 2.99% fee plus a variable fee. Using a stablecoin attracts a significantly smaller fee than that. Also, these transactions are faster than traditional methods like wire transfer. Citi believes that stablecoins will continue gaining market share in the coming years. In a recent report , the company estimated that stablecoins will be worth over $1.6 trillion by 2030, while Standard Chartered estimates that they will reach $2 trillion by 2028. Read more: Hack?

Best Time to Hold XRP, DOGE, and This Crypto with 15029% Upside appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Three tokens namely XRP, DOGE, and RXS have gained worldwide attention because global markets react to the latest tariff developments. During China’s worst tariff ordeal investors seek resilient assets that provide significant financial returns. A portfolio decision requires investors to choose between XRP at $2.08 with a potential breakout potential and DOGE with surprising resistance against whale selloffs and RXS—Rexas Finance—with its predicted 23,890% increase over 180 days. The Ripple Effect Has Led XRP to Achieve Its Timely Market Surge The current economic turbulence has made XRP central to payment speed and utility solutions in international transactions. The market demonstrates renewed interest in XRP based on its recent $2.08 opening price which increased by 0.39%. The technical signals along with historical data indicate XRP is about to reach its previous highest price of $3.84 while future predictions show potential for a significant increase up to $7.77. XRP demonstrates strong resilience alongside explosive growth potential so investors should consider holding the token during this market period full of uncertainty. According to this chart based solely on past performance, Fibonacci levels, and Teslas 3-6-9 theory, NOW is the time we start to go up – test all time high – breakthrough ATH at $3.84 – test moonshot breakout point at $7.77 – then go up and never stop. $100 XRP by October. pic.twitter.com/ZRidiyMCMA — BURN XRP (@BurnXrp28366) April 18, 2025 DOGE: Volatility and Opportunity Amid Whale Movements Source – X Dogecoin has experienced continuous success from unpredictable market behavior which continues during the tariff-driven market period.

Investors who want to access tangible value in digital form are turning to RXS because it is becoming the preferred choice for exposure to real-world assets. RXS distinguishes itself from other cryptocurrencies since analysts predict it will surge by 23,890% within 180 days.

The RWA emphasis of RXS enables investors to protect themselves from inflation and economic turmoil which intensified because of the global trade disruptions caused by tariffs. The platform offers a secure blockchain-powered system that lets users engage in asset-backed investments and lending and yield generation through its comprehensive ecosystem. The unique operational model differentiates RXS from other decentralized finance solutions by bringing together utility and real-world value features.

The technical prowess of XRP combined with DOGE’s potential recovery potential and RXS’s real-world asset focus provides investors with three distinct growth opportunities while the cryptocurrency market anticipates a predicted 23,890% increase and 92.24% presale completion. People who invest before RXS lists at $0.25 on June 19, 2025 will potentially benefit from the upcoming crypto market expansion.

The bipartisan bill, co-sponsored by Senator Bill Hagerty (R-TN) and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), aims to establish the first-ever regulatory framework for payment stablecoins in the United States. Hagerty Eyes Bipartisan Breakthrough Senator Hagerty remains optimistic despite the bill’s rocky journey. On May 8 , the GENIUS Act fell short of the 60-vote threshold required for cloture— only 48 senators voted in favor , while 49 opposed . Concerns from Democrats included: Weak anti-money laundering (AML) measures Lack of oversight on foreign-issued stablecoins Insufficient consumer protection mechanisms In response, bipartisan negotiations have led to key amendments . FOX Business reporter Eleanor Terrett confirmed on X that the revised version includes: Enhanced customer safeguards Clearer bankruptcy protection for stablecoin holders Ethical restrictions, barring Big Tech firms (like Meta, Google) and individuals like Elon Musk from issuing stablecoins These additions aim to win support from cautious lawmakers and ensure the bill aligns with investor protection and national security goals. Stablecoin Market: A $246 Billion Sector Awaits Regulation The timing is crucial. The global stablecoin market is now worth over $246 billion , with Tether’s USDT ($151B) and Circle’s USDC ($61B) leading the charge. These tokens, pegged 1:1 with fiat currency, are essential for traders, institutions, and fintech innovators. Use cases are growing fast. Mastercard’s partnership with MoonPay is enabling stablecoin payments for 150 million merchants worldwide —further validating the need for regulation. Senator Hagerty argues the GENIUS Act would: Cement the U.S. dollar’s dominance in the digital economy Increase demand for U.S. Treasuries Encourage fintech innovation to stay within U.S. borders Can the GENIUS Act Pass? To pass, the Senate requires 60 votes . As of May 17, 2025 , the chamber makeup is: Democrats (including Independents): 51 seats Republicans: 49 seats With no party holding a filibuster-proof majority, the bill’s success hinges on bipartisan cooperation .

However, unlike the latter, they managed to avoid leaking user data thanks to effective internal security systems, Bloomberg reports . Details of the Attack on Coinbase On May 15, the exchange Coinbase reported that cybercriminals bribed offshore support staff. Thus, the attackers gained access to users' personal data and account management records. According to the exchange's estimates, addressing the consequences of the incident and voluntary compensation payments to clients will cost Coinbase about $400 million. In addition, the company announced a $20 million reward for information that will help to convict the blackmailers. However, the exchange emphasized that user passwords, private keys, and funds were not directly compromised. Scheme of the Attack on Binance and Kraken It remains unclear whether the hackers who attacked Binance and Kraken were the same ones who successfully hacked Coinbase. According to Bloomberg, the attackers attempted to contact the support representatives of these exchanges via Telegram, requesting sensitive customer information such as account balances and home addresses. Fortunately for users, the artificial intelligence-based security systems of both exchanges recognized and blocked these social engineering attacks in time. Analysis and Conclusion This case shows how sophisticated the methods of cybercriminals targeting cryptocurrency exchanges are becoming. Instead of direct attacks on technical systems, they are increasingly using social engineering to try to manipulate company employees. Attacks on cryptocurrency exchanges are becoming more and more targeted, and now hackers are not only trying to breach defenses, but also looking for weak links among staff.

Bitcoin has failed to jump above the key resistance at $105,000, while most altcoins have dropped by double digits from their highest levels this week. This article highlights the top 3 crypto tokens to sell to avoid long-term losses. Top crypto tokens to sell today Some of the top crypto tokens to sell or avoid today are Berachain (BERA), Pi Network (PI), and Official Trump (TRUMP). Berachain is a top crypto to sell Berachain is one of the top cryptocurrencies to sell or avoid this year as its fundamentals worsened. BERA token has already plunged from a high of $9.57 in March to $3.1 today, and this downtrend may continue. Data shows that the Berachain network is not doing well. Its total value locked (TVL) has plunged by 43% in the last 30 days to $3 billion, making it the eighth biggest chain in the crypto market. Most dApps in the ecosystem have shed assets in the past few months. Infrared Finance’s total value locked dropped by 24% in the last 30 days to $1.07 billion, while Kodiak, SatLayer, Dolomite, and Concrete have shed assets worth millions in the past 30 days. Worse, the supply of stablecoins in the Berachain continued to fall this year. It has stablecoin market cap has dropped to $230 million, down from $1.34 billion in March. Berachain has a maximum supply of 501 million and a circulating supply of 119.45 million, meaning holders will be highly dilutive. The dilution will start in February 6 next year when 63.75 million will be unlocked. Berachain stablecoin market cap | Source: DeFi Llama Pi Network (PI) has a centralization issue Pi Network is one of the top crypto tokens to sell to avoid long-term losses. The coin crashed by over 80% from its highest level in February. It dropped by over 60% from its highest point last week. Pi Network has more downsides to overcome in the coming months because of its centralization issues. The obscure Pi Foundation is responsible for the network and holds over 72 billion unlocked tokens. Therefore, there is a risk that something like a hack can happen, leading to more downside in the long term.

Just read on..Pi Network’s got some serious secrets, and we’re spilling ALL the tea. Could this be the next crypto crash waiting to happen? Let’s dive in! 👇💰 The Numbers Don’t Lie: 89 2:45 PM · May 15, 2025 1.4K Reply Copy link Read 605 replies There is also a risk of an imbalance between supply and demand. Pi Network’s supply is expected to grow by over 1.4 billion tokens in the next 12 months, and over 70 billion more in the next few years. The centralization aspect explains why top exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken have resisted listing it. Therefore, the path of the least resistance for the Pi token is bearish, with the next point to watch being at $0.40. Read more: Pi Network price prediction: Will Pi Coin recover from this plunge? Official Trump (TRUMP) The Official Trump token is another one to sell as it lacks a clear catalyst in the coming months. TRUMP meme coin was trading at $12.87 on Saturday, down by 22% from its highest point this month and 77% above its lowest level in April. The rally happened as investors bought the coin ahead of Donald Trump’s dinner scheduled for May 22. The risk, therefore, is that many of the participants will sell their tokens before or after the dinner. Similarly, people who bought the coin in anticipation of the dinner will likely start selling their tokens. Also, technically, the token has formed a double-top pattern at $15.25, with a neckline at $10.38. Therefore, the path of the least resistance for the TRUMP price is bearish, with the key target being at $7.17, its lowest point in April.

Kiyosaki reveals the commodity he’s buying more,https://finbold.com/r-kiyosaki-reveals-the-commodity-hes-buying-more/,"Robert Kiyosaki , the best-selling author of ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’ , has again thrown his weight behind Bitcoin ( BTC ), now recommending increased accumulation of the digital asset. According to the investor, he is not only holding the cryptocurrency but is actively buying more as the asset trades above the crucial $100,000 spot, he said in an X post on May 17. Kiyosaki believes Bitcoin will surge to $250,000 this year, doubling down on his prediction amid what he describes as a collapsing global financial system. For the long term, he sees BTC hitting $1 million . The financial educator warned that the “Marxist Central Bank system” is unraveling, arguing that alternative commodities such as gold , silver, and Bitcoin will thrive as fiat currencies and traditional institutions lose credibility and stability. GOOD NEWS for people with not much money. I am buying more silver eagles today. The good news is silver is the biggest investment bargain today. Gold has already hit all time highs. I have plenty of Bitcoin. And silver is still 50% below its all time high….today about $35.… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) April 22, 2025 His renewed Bitcoin endorsement follows months of broader support for hard assets. Earlier, as reported by Finbold, Kiyosaki had expressed strong interest in silver , calling it the most undervalued investment opportunity on the market. He highlighted silver’s current prices, still significantly below its historical highs, as a rare chance for individuals with limited capital to begin building wealth. Silver YTD price chart. Source: TradingView Kiyosaki on why Bitcoin is better than gold While gold has already reached new highs and Bitcoin continues to gain institutional momentum, Kiyosaki maintained that Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins sets it apart. Unlike gold or silver, which can be mined in larger quantities when prices rise, Bitcoin’s scarcity is absolute, reinforcing its long-term value. Although Kiyosaki owns gold, silver, and oil-producing assets, he views Bitcoin as the purest hedge against inflation and central bank mismanagement . “One reason why I trust Bitcoin is there are only to ever be 21 million. I own gold and silver mines and oil wells. If the price of gold, silver, or oil goes up, I will simply mine or drill for more, expanding supply,” he said. It’s worth noting that the investor has warned of an impending economic crash for years, one he believes is already underway. In response, he continues to champion alternative assets as the ideal means of preserving and protecting wealth in an increasingly unstable financial world.

The woman didn’t reveal her name during the trial. She stole around $488,000 worth of crypto, worth around 683 million won. She stole the funds on January 5 but was only sentenced this week. The woman was convicted of embezzlement. She also stole around $1,430 worth of cash, worth around 2 million won. Korean media reported on the case, describing the woman secretly transferring her partner’s crypto, worth around 700 million won. The incident happened on January 5 while her boyfriend was sleeping. The woman has admitted to all the charges but claims that she returned most of the money and only owes around 21.9 million won. The woman asked for leniency because she felt remorseful for her actions and tried to return the stolen funds. However, Korean media reports that the courts gave the woman a harsh sentence, given that she has a history of fraud and that the amount of money was substantial. The court in Jeju province, South Korea, handled the court case. The woman’s lawyers pleaded for clemency because the woman had returned most of the money. The woman only owed around $15,000 at the time of the court case, which is still a lot of money, yet a much lesser sum than the original funds. The woman, however, had two previous convictions of fraud and was on trial for another fraud case when she stole her boyfriend’s crypto. The court would not give her a second chance because she had already had plenty of chances flash before her. The original crime occurred at 11:50 pm at the boyfriend’s home in Jeju City on January 7. The woman had carefully memorised her boyfriend’s details so that she could access his phone while he was sleeping. The woman stole his phone and used his exchange and banking apps to transfer the funds to her personal bank account. After securing the stolen money, the woman fled, boarding a plane for another part of Korea, where she could presumably enjoy the money she had stolen. However, the police caught up to her at a hotel in Gumi, North Gyeongsang Province.

New SEC filings from Burry’s Scion Asset Management show the firm has taken a substantial bearish stance against Nvidia (NVDA), opening a large position in put options against the chipmaker’s stock. Scion has also reversed its previously bullish outlook on Chinese equities. The fund acquired bearish put options on major Chinese companies, including Alibaba (BABA) and Baidu (BIDU). And here’s the twist – Scion’s only remaining long position is in New York-based Estee Lauder (EL), a bet on the cosmetics giant’s potential recovery. This solitary bullish stance underscores Burry’s cautious approach on the market, with the makeup industry often believed to be resilient to recession. This is the second time in recent years that Burry has gutted Scion’s portfolio. In 2023, Burry drastically reduced Scion’s holdings, only to later admit he was wrong while placing new, targeted bets.

While bearish indicators suggest a possible decline, a crypto analyst reveals that the broader trend remains intact, with technical patterns supporting the potential for a rally toward the $0.9 mark. Cardano Price Crash Incoming TradingView Crypto analyst SiDec has released a bearish price forecast for Cardano, anticipating a significant correction toward the $0.75 area in the coming days. This cautious outlook is based on detailed analysis using Elliott Wave Theory, Fibonacci tools, and critical price action zones. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Releases Next Potential Targets For Cardano, Is $1 ADA Still Possible? SiDec has stated that ADA’s price continues to consolidate after completing a 5-wave impulse move, signaling the end of its upward momentum. Following this strong impulse rally, the cryptocurrency is now exhibiting a classic Elliott Wave behavior, transitioning into a textbook ABC corrective pattern. The cryptocurrency first experienced a pull-back, labeled as Wave A on the price chart, followed by a temporary recovery in Wave B. According to SiDec, Wave C is expected to complete the retracement pattern, with ADA’s final downward move nearing its end. Currently, technical indicators and price action point to the $0.705 region as a high-probability long entry zone. The TradingView analyst also clarifies where ADA might find solid support during this corrective phase using Fibonacci Retracement zones. The 50% retracement level of the entire bullish 5-wave impulse is positioned approximately at $0.7534 — a critical price point that coincides closely with ADA’s previous price swing at $0.746. This former resistance level has yet to be revisited, making it a natural support candidate. The analysis further identifies a 1:1 ABC extension for the anticipated correction in ADA, placing Wave C’s potential crash target around $0.7492. This also creates a tight cluster of technical indicators in the range of roughly $0.75, indicating a strong support zone. Further supporting this level, the daily 21 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) stands at $0.7455, while the daily 21 Simple Moving Average (SMA) is slightly lower at $0.7347. SiDec has also identified the Point of Control (POC), which marks the price with the highest volume, near $0.7318. The analyst further highlights that Cardano’s anchored Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) resides within the $0.75 support zone. At the same time, the Pitchfork tool’s golden pocket aligns dynamically as support around the same area. ADA Price Path To $0.92 Holds Firm While SiDec eyes a potential crash to new lows for ADA in the near term, the analyst’s chart also shows a green zone, with a projected bullish bounce drawn. Following its Wave C crash, Cardano is expected to rebound and approach the $0.92 level. Related Reading: Cardano Price Set For 300% Explosion With Major Bullish Impulse The TradingView analyst has advised caution around this area, as $0.92 acts as a significant resistance zone and coincides with a prior liquidity zone that could trigger rejection or profit-taking. SiDec has emphasized that the risk-to-reward ratio around this area will only become favorable once there is clear confirmation, such as an SFP, a bearish engulfing candle, or visible divergence. Overall, if the $0.75 support zone holds, Cardano, which is currently trading at $0.78, could be positioned for a strong recovery toward $0.92 and beyond.

33767162,[object Object],1747503058,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Ethereum Accumulation Accelerates – Smart Money Snaps Up 450K ETH,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-accumulation-accelerates-smart-money-snaps-up-450k-eth/,"Ethereum is now at a pivotal moment following last week’s explosive rally that pushed prices above several key resistance levels. After surging past $2,700, ETH has pulled back and is now consolidating above the $2,400 mark. This zone has become a critical battleground between bulls looking to confirm a breakout and bears eyeing a deeper correction. To sustain the current bullish momentum, Ethereum must hold above $2,400 and retake the $2,800 level—an area that marks the upper boundary of the current consolidation range. A confirmed breakout above $2,800 could ignite a broader rally and signal the start of a long-awaited altseason. Adding strength to the bullish case, new data from CryptoQuant reveals that smart money is accumulating ETH quickly. This large-scale accumulation suggests growing confidence among institutional players and long-term investors, even amid heightened volatility. All eyes are now on how Ethereum reacts at these levels. A successful defense of support and a breakout above resistance could set the stage for a strong continuation. But failure to hold above $2,400 would likely invite more downside pressure and delay further bullish advances. Smart Money Backs Ethereum As Bulls Defend Key Support Ethereum is showing renewed bullish strength as market sentiment turns optimistic across the crypto landscape. After surging more than 50% in recent weeks, ETH is holding above the $2,400 level, a key support zone that traders and analysts alike are watching closely. To solidify a bullish phase and confirm the start of a sustainable rally, bulls must push Ethereum decisively above the $2,800 mark. This would trigger fresh momentum and potentially unlock a path back toward the $3,000–$3,200 region. Despite the positive signs, risks remain. Ethereum is still down approximately 36% from its December 2024 high near $4,100. This gap highlights the work bulls still have to do to fully reverse the broader downtrend. The recent pause below resistance is a natural cooling-off phase, but if ETH fails to hold above support, bearish pressure could return quickly. Still, institutional confidence appears to be growing. According to data shared by top analyst Ali Martinez, smart money has accumulated over 450,000 ETH in the past month. This surge in whale accumulation suggests a longer-term bullish outlook, as large holders typically buy during moments of market consolidation to position for future upside. If bulls succeed in defending $2,400 and break through the $2,800 ceiling, Ethereum could become the catalyst for a broader altcoin rally—possibly marking the beginning of a new altseason. Price Action: Key Levels In Focus Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading around $2,493 after failing to sustain momentum above the $2,700 mark. On the 4-hour chart, we can observe a clear break in the steep uptrend that started in early May. After an explosive surge from below $2,000, ETH rallied aggressively, but is now entering a corrective phase marked by lower highs and increasing selling pressure. The price is approaching the $2,480–$2,460 region, which could serve as short-term support. If that zone breaks, the next confluence of interest lies near $2,300. Volume has slightly declined during this retracement, suggesting that sellers are cautious rather than dominant. However, failure to hold above $2,400 could shift sentiment and invite deeper pullbacks. The 200-period EMA and SMA on the 4-hour chart sit well below the current price, at $2,084 and $1,936 respectively, indicating that ETH is still in bullish territory from a trend perspective. These moving averages could serve as dynamic support if the correction intensifies. Overall, Ethereum remains in a strong uptrend, but the current pullback suggests a consolidation phase is underway. Bulls need to defend key levels and break above $2,700 again to regain upside momentum and aim for the $2,800–$3,000 range.

This move signifies a significant step in integrating XRP into the traditional financial markets, offering both institutional and retail investors a regulated avenue to engage with this digital asset. The announcement, highlighted by Coin Bureau on their X account, underscores the growing institutional interest in XRP and its underlying technology. Coin Bureau’s post emphasized the importance of this launch, stating, “Mark your calendars! This Monday, May 19th, XRP futures will officially debut on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), one of the biggest derivatives markets globally.” Mark your calendars! This Monday – May 19th, $XRP futures will officially debut on Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), one of the biggest derivatives market globally. pic.twitter.com/L5hOQy2hzC — Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) May 17, 2025 CME’s Strategic Expansion into Altcoin Derivatives CME Group’s decision to introduce XRP futures aligns with its broader strategy to expand its cryptocurrency derivatives offerings beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Earlier this year, CME launched Solana futures, reflecting the exchange’s commitment to providing diverse investment products in response to market demand. The addition of XRP futures caters to investors seeking exposure to alternative digital assets within a regulated framework. Giovanni Vicioso, Global Head of Cryptocurrency Products at CME Group, commented on the launch, stating, “As innovation in the digital asset landscape continues to evolve, market participants continue to look to regulated derivatives products to manage risks across a wider range of tokens.” This sentiment reflects the growing need for sophisticated financial instruments to navigate the dynamic cryptocurrency market. Contract Specifications and Trading Details The upcoming XRP futures contracts will be cash-settled, based on the CME CF XRP-Dollar Reference Rate, which aggregates XRP pricing data from multiple exchanges to provide a reliable daily benchmark. Two contract sizes will be available: a standard contract representing 50,000 XRP and a micro contract representing 2,500 XRP. This dual offering ensures accessibility for a broad spectrum of investors, from large institutions to individual traders. Trading will commence on CME’s electronic trading platform, CME Globex, and will also be available for clearing via CME ClearPort. Notably, retail trading platform Robinhood has confirmed plans to offer CME’s XRP futures to its users, further democratizing access to these financial instruments. Implications for XRP and the Broader Crypto Market The introduction of XRP futures is anticipated to have several significant impacts on both XRP’s market dynamics and the broader cryptocurrency landscape. Firstly, the availability of regulated futures contracts is expected to enhance liquidity in the XRP market. By providing a mechanism for price discovery and risk management, futures contracts can attract a wider range of participants, including institutional investors who may have previously been hesitant to engage with unregulated crypto markets. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Secondly, the launch of XRP futures could catalyze the approval of XRP-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Historically, the existence of a regulated futures market has been a prerequisite for the approval of spot ETFs by regulatory bodies. The establishment of XRP futures trading on CME may thus pave the way for future ETF products, further integrating XRP into traditional investment portfolios. Furthermore, the increased visibility and legitimacy conferred by CME’s endorsement could positively influence XRP’s price trajectory. Analysts have noted that XRP has already demonstrated resilience in 2025, with a year-to-date gain of 5.3%, outperforming both Bitcoin and Ethereum during the same period. The added institutional interest and trading volume resulting from the futures launch could bolster this upward momentum. Ripple’s Legal Milestone and Market Outlook The timing of the XRP futures launch coincides with positive developments in Ripple Labs’ legal battle against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which had accused the company of conducting unregistered securities offerings. The final resolution of this lawsuit will remove a significant regulatory overhang, enabling broader participation in XRP markets and facilitating the introduction of new financial products like futures contracts. Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple Labs, expressed enthusiasm about the development, stating, “While overdue in a bunch of ways, this is an incredibly important and exciting step in the continued growth of the XRP market.” His remarks underscore the significance of CME’s endorsement in legitimizing XRP as a mature and investable asset class. The forthcoming launch of XRP futures on CME represents a pivotal moment in the evolution of cryptocurrency markets. By bridging the gap between digital assets and traditional financial infrastructure, this development enhances the accessibility, liquidity, and legitimacy of XRP. As the market anticipates the May 19 debut, investors and industry observers alike will be closely monitoring the impact of this milestone on XRP’s performance and the broader adoption of cryptocurrency derivatives.

This has been the case for most of May. In a recent X post , Chris Kuiper, the Vice President of Research at Fidelity Digital Assets, said Bitcoin is still in its “Acceleration Phase.” This is a period when many wallets profit, and price swings are common. In May, 10 days have already shown high profits and strong movement. Still, Bitcoin has not moved past its recent top price level. Most Bitcoin Wallets Are in Profit, But Traders Are Cautious On May 13, the flagship cryptocurrency closed at $104,119. At that point, 99% of Bitcoin wallets were in profit. This usually indicates a strong interest and leads to a price increase. However, a recent CryptoQuant report revealed that futures market traders are not confident. The report highlighted that more people are betting on the price going down than up. This is measured by a number called “cumulative net taker volume,” which has stayed negative since Bitcoin returned above $100,000. Despite strong support from long-term holders, the price has remained between $94,000 and $104,000. Spot and Derivatives Markets Disagree There is now a clear difference between what is happening on the blockchain and what is happening in the futures market. On the blockchain, Bitcoin looks strong. However, in the futures market, many traders place short bets, which puts pressure on the price. This has also caused Bitcoin’s price to become very stable. In fact, according to VanEck’s head of digital asset research, Matthew Sigel, Bitcoin’s 30-day volatility is now lower than gold’s for the first time. The BBR/GC1 ratio is now 0.857, the weakest in 10 years. Bitcoin Awaits a Futures Market Shift Meanwhile, periods of low volatility like this often come before big price changes. However, the futures market must change for Bitcoin’s price to climb. More traders need to start betting on price increases. It is important to note that the global economy and the amount of money available in the market also affect Bitcoin’s volatility and potential price movements. According to CoinMarketCap data, Bitcoin’s price is currently trading at $102,728, down by 1.08% in the last 24 hours. Industry leaders and institutions have provided different forecasts for Bitcoin’s price trajectory. In April, Geoffrey Kendrick, head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered, predicted that the leading crypto asset could reach $120,000 by the second quarter of 2025. Meanwhile, Cathie Wood, CEO of ARK Invest, believes Bitcoin could reach $1 million before 2030 , thanks to the growing interest from big investors.

New Zealand’s Financial Crime Group made the arrest following an FBI-led probe into the criminal network. According to authorities , the cryptocurrency was fraudulently obtained between March and August 2024 through victim manipulation tactics, with the stolen funds laundered through multiple cryptocurrency platforms.

A total of 13 individuals now face charges in connection with the scheme. According to the details, the Wellington man has been accused by the US Department of Justice of racketeering (RICO). The charges also include conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Prosecutors allege the defendants used the funds from the crypto scam to fund an extravagant lifestyle. They also spent approximately $9 million on exotic cars, hundreds of thousands of dollars on luxury handbags, watches, and clothing, and up to $500,000 per evening on nightclub services. Other purchases allegedly included private security guards and high-end rental properties in Los Angeles, the Hamptons, and Miami. Following an appearance in Auckland District Court, the man was granted bail and received interim name suppression. He is scheduled to reappear in court on July 3. According to a U.S. Department of Justice statement , the superseding indictment unsealed charges against 12 additional people. This includes both American and foreign nationals for allegedly participating in the cyber-enabled racketeering conspiracy. Several suspects were arrested in California this week, while two remain abroad and are believed to be living in Dubai. The criminal enterprise allegedly operated from October 2023 through March 2025, with members reportedly acquiring a fleet of at least 28 exotic cars ranging in value from $100,000 to $3.8 million.

ICP Rises 11% & PI Shows Promise,https://thecoinrise.com/crypto-whales-rush-to-unstakeds-1m-giveaway-icp-rises-11-pi-shows-promise/,"Could the next 600x breakout already be priced under one cent? Internet Computer (ICP) has climbed 11% this week and is seeing renewed activity, while Pi Network (PI) continues to attract attention even though it’s yet to become fully tradable. Both are being tracked closely, but neither currently presents the kind of growth route that Unstaked offers, especially with its functional AI tools nearing activation. Unstaked has launched a $1 million giveaway tied to its $UNSD token. Currently priced at $0.00926 in stage 13 of the presale, with expert projections aiming for a $5 future value, Unstaked opens the door to nearly 600x returns. Its AI agents are designed to support user engagement on X, Telegram, and Discord automatically. For those exploring the top crypto to buy now, Unstaked stands out, not as a concept, but as tech preparing to go live once the presale concludes. Unstaked’s $1M Giveaway and Presale Build Strong Upside Case The Unstaked team recently launched a $1 million $UNSD giveaway, drawing widespread attention. To enter, participants must hold at least $100 worth of UNSD, carry out basic tasks, and refer new users. While 20 winners will share the prize pool, the larger benefit could come from just holding the token before it hits exchanges. At the stage 13 price of $0.00926, $UNSD is still trading under a cent. Yet its launch price is set at $0.1819, and long-term expectations remain fixed on a potential $5 level. This gives buyers a nearly 600x upside to holders who join the presale now. Within just 48 hours, Unstaked pulled in $2 million, bringing its total presale funding to $6 million, capturing attention from both small and large-scale buyers. What makes Unstaked different is its actual utility. Once launched, its AI agents will independently handle tasks across Telegram, Discord, and X, giving users the chance to earn UNSD through interactions. This adds a layer of practicality, making Unstaked more than a speculative name. It stands among the top cryptos to buy now for those focused on usable Web3 platforms. Internet Computer (ICP) Sees Uptick Amid On-Chain Progress Momentum has returned for Internet Computer (ICP), which has gained 11% over the last week and is currently valued at around $13.21. This growth follows greater ecosystem activity and rising developer traction. ICP’s core strength is in enabling full-stack decentralized applications to run directly on its network, without depending on external cloud providers. A key factor driving this surge is increased interest from institutions and integration updates rolled out by the DFINITY Foundation. ICP’s approach, offering smart contracts, storage, and frontend access all on-chain, sets it apart from typical Layer-1 networks. While its price remains far from previous highs, the current trend and usage data point toward possible growth, especially as decentralized infrastructure gains traction. PI Network Growth Potential Hinges on Mainnet and Utility Pi Network (PI) continues to draw attention as the project edges closer to its mainnet release. At present, PI trades at roughly $1.17 through IOU listings on platforms like CoinMarketCap, which don’t represent true market availability. Yet, over 40 million users have joined through mobile mining and referral invites, giving it one of the biggest community builds to date. The big question now is whether that massive user base will convert into a meaningful market presence. According to analysts, Pi Network’s real growth potential lies in achieving actual utility, tradability, and governance. If mainnet deployment is postponed again, it could slow progress. However, if launch metrics are strong and real use cases emerge, price estimates from $5 to $20 might still be valid. For now, it’s a closely watched project in 2025, not for its listings, but due to expectations from its massive community. Final Takeaway! ICP’s recent 11% rise and over $2.6 billion in locked value show increasing developer confidence in its on-chain framework. Simultaneously, Pi Network maintains its position in watchlists due to its immense user base and upcoming full launch. However, another strong candidate is making its move. Unstaked is already running a $1 million giveaway, with users gaining from both potential earnings and upcoming functionality. The token remains at $0.00926 in stage 13 of the crypto presale , with a listing price of $0.1819 and long-range targets up to $5. This $5 target suggests up to 600x returns for early buyers. For anyone exploring the top crypto to buy now, Unstaked offers more than a promise, it’s a platform nearing execution.

Speaking during a livestream published by Taiwan’s Formosa TV News, CEO Jensen Huang said the Hopper H20 architecture cannot be modified any further to meet US government export rules. “It’s not Hopper because it’s not possible to modify Hopper anymore,” Jensen said on Saturday, addressing the question about what chip could replace H20 in the Chinese market. The company is now figuring out what to offer instead, after Washington blocked additional shipments of H20, the only AI chip from Nvidia still allowed to be sold in China under current rules. That chip was already a stripped-down version of earlier designs, made specifically to stay under the export thresholds. With no more room to adjust Hopper, Nvidia will have to come up with a completely different product if it wants to keep selling legally in China. Nvidia looks to survive in China as AI rules tighten Jensen traveled to China shortly after the restrictions were announced, underlining just how much the market still matters to the company. China brought in $17 billion for Nvidia in the fiscal year ending January 26, which made up 13% of the company’s total revenue. But holding onto that number is getting harder. As reported by Reuters, the company is planning to launch a new downgraded chip sometime in the next two months. The unnamed chip won’t belong to the Hopper family, Jensen said. That confirms what many had suspected: the design limits of Hopper have been fully reached, and Nvidia has no more legal wiggle room with that line. The current regulations come from the Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion, a policy introduced in January by the Biden administration, just a week before President Donald Trump returned to the White House. The rules blocked advanced AI chips from being exported to several countries, including China. Speaking about those controls, Jensen said they were a mistake. “Export controls should be designed to maximize the proliferation of US technology,” he said, criticizing the Biden-era framework. Trump has said that he plans to cancel the AI diffusion policy completely, calling it bad for business and innovation. But for now, the restrictions remain in place, and Nvidia is stuck trying to keep a foothold in China without breaking the law. At the same time, local players like Huawei are gaining ground in the AI chip market, taking advantage of Nvidia’s regulatory setbacks. The company isn’t exiting China, but it’s now forced to rely on low-performance alternatives until a new architecture is ready.

In an interview at Consensus 2025, the executive said that Pyth Network's data pull model sets it apart from traditional pricing oracles, allowing customers to pay for data on demand, reducing costs for institutions reliant on real-time market data. Differences between pull and push models in oracle systems. Source: Pyth Network According to the executive, the financial data industry is currently monopolized by around eight major providers that continually raise prices on clients arbitrarily. James added: ""These data vendors have no competition in traditional finance, and so they have all the pricing power in the world. There is no substitutability; whether you are a banker or hedge fund and you are trading more or less — you still have to buy that data for compliance reasons."" The high costs of financial data stifle innovation and prohibit small to medium-sized businesses from taking part in the global financial services industry, further concentrating the sector in the hands of a few large players and preventing novel use cases from emerging.

Here’s What On-Chain Data Is Telling Investors,https://cryptopotato.com/are-bitcoin-mining-stocks-mispriced-heres-what-on-chain-data-is-telling-investors/,"The on-chain intelligence platform CryptoQuant has unveiled a framework for monitoring the revenues of leading public Bitcoin mining companies. This methodology tells whether the companies are undervalued or overvalued in real time. CryptoQuant revealed in its latest weekly report that the framework tracks miners’ addresses on the Bitcoin blockchain and their BTC production. This enables analysts to derive revenue metrics not disclosed via traditional corporate procedures. The Valuation Methodology The Bitcoin mining companies monitored through CryptoQuant’s framework include Marathon Digital (MARA), Riot Blockchain (RIOT), and Core Scientific (CORZ). The analytics firm also tracked the revenue metrics of Hive Digital Technologies (HIVE), CleanSpark (CLSK), Bitfarms (BITF), TeraWulf Inc. (WULF), Cipher Mining (CIPHER), and IREN (IREN), formerly Iris Energy. According to the report, CryptoQuant analysts estimated daily mining revenues directly from block rewards and transaction fees by tracking miner addresses. The revenue estimates are annualized and compared to the mining firms’ market cap. From there, the analysts offer a forward-looking valuation framework similar to a price-to-sales ratio. CryptoQuant calls this the Market Cap to Annualized Daily Revenues (MCAR) ratio. The MCAR ratio tells whether a miner’s underlying Bitcoin production or USD-denominated revenue supports the company’s valuation. “By comparing each company’s market capitalization to its annualized revenue on a daily basis, investors can identify which firms are potentially overvalued or undervalued. This enables more informed portfolio allocation—favoring companies whose market valuations lag behind their revenue generation while reducing exposure to those trading at excessive premiums,” CryptoQuant stated. WULF and MARA Valued at Relative Premiums From CryptoQuant’s analysis, the MCAR ratios for WULF, MARA, RIOT, CLSK, HIVE, and IREN are 5.1, 4.4, 3.7, 3.3, 1.9, and 1.8, respectively. These numbers reflect how much investors pay for every dollar of estimated annual revenue in real time. WULF and MARA have the highest valuation multiples, so CryptoQuant believes they are priced at a significant premium compared to the other firms. RIOT, CLSK, and HIVE are not as overvalued, so their market valuations hover within the same range as their revenue generation . CryptoQuant found that IREN has the lowest valuation despite posting strong growth in its BTC production. This suggests that the company is likely undervalued by the market. On the brighter side, the firm faces a potential upside if it becomes repriced in the market. “The current valuation dispersion opens opportunities for relative value strategies by identifying firms like IREN that may be lagging in market recognition despite solid operational performance,” the analytics firm added.

XRP is surging past bearish hurdles, targeting $3.40. These three crypto coins are bound for higher crypto prices soon. Cardano’s integration with Brave’s 85 million users is sparking fresh interest. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is drawing intense demand, raising $8,500,000 in its presale with over 476 million tokens sold to 10,000 holders. These coins, blending utility and momentum, are shaping up as the best cryptos to buy now. Their unique strengths promise hefty returns, making them prime picks for investors chasing the next big cryptocurrency breakthrough. XRP’s bullish breakout XRP is carving a bold path in the crypto market, shrugging off a failed bearish pattern. A head-and-shoulders breakdown fizzled in April, with prices rebounding from $1.60 to above $2.50. This swift recovery signals robust bullish control. Trading volumes are spiking, reflecting trader confidence. CoinDesk’s AI-assisted analysis projects XRP hitting $2.85 by June, with some analysts eyeing $3.33 or higher. Holding firm above its 200-day moving average, XRP’s resilience during market dips underscores its strength. While it powers Ripple’s cross-border transactions, its price action makes it a top crypto to buy for short-term gains, though it lacks the DeFi utility of newer projects. Cardano’s brave boost Cardano (ADA) is gaining traction with its recent integration into Brave’s multi-chain wallet, exposing its blockchain to 85 million users. Priced at $0.83, ADA has climbed 60% from April lows of $0.51. The crypto market’s optimism, fueled by easing U.S. inflation and reduced tariffs, supports risk assets like ADA. If an altcoin season ignites, ADA could revisit its 2024 highs of $1.30 or even climb to $3. Projects like BitcoinOS and Midnight enhance Cardano’s DeFi and privacy features, yet its total value locked trails Ethereum. ADA remains a solid long-term crypto investment, but its adoption lags behind emerging DeFi stars. Mutuum Finance’s presale surge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is commanding attention in its presale’s fourth phase, priced at $0.025, up from $0.01 in the opening phase. Phase 4 is 80% filled, with phase 5 looming at $0.03—a 20% jump from the current price. Investors buying now will see a 140% return at the $0.06 launch listing. Analysts predict a post-launch surge to $2.50, yielding a 9,900% ROI. The project’s lending platform, enabling passive income through mtTokens, drives its appeal. A $2,500 investment today could balloon to $250,000 post-launch. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as the best crypto to invest in for explosive growth, outpacing XRP and ADA’s utility. Security and rewards push Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is prioritizing trust, actively pursuing a Certik audit for its smart contracts. An announcement will hit socials once finalized, boosting investor confidence. The team recently launched a dashboard showcasing a leaderboard of the top 50 holders, who’ll earn bonus tokens for maintaining their rank. This fuels FOMO as phase 4 nears completion. The buy-and-distribute model, redirecting platform revenue to token stakers, ensures steady demand. Unlike XRP’s transaction focus or ADA’s ecosystem, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) blends real-world DeFi utility with high-yield potential, making it a top cryptocurrency for investors seeking the next crypto to explode in 2025. Path to millions XRP, Cardano, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are defining the crypto market’s future. XRP’s price momentum, Cardano’s user expansion, and Mutuum Finance’s DeFi innovation offer distinct paths to wealth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), with its presale success and projected 9,900% ROI, eclipses its peers in growth potential. Investors eyeing the best crypto to buy now should act fast—Mutuum Finance’s phase 4 is nearly gone.

His analysis follows recent comments from media personality Dave Portnoy , who disclosed that he invested in XRP not due to detailed research, but from a desire to avoid missing out if the asset experiences a dramatic surge in value. To substantiate the possibility of XRP becoming a dominant force in digital finance, SMQKE referenced a range of studies and institutional documents, each outlining XRP’s unique technological and structural attributes. WHY XRP COULD BE THE NEXT BITCOIN “The difference between the XRPL and other major blockchain networks such as Bitcoin and Ethereum is that XRPL uses the Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA) as its consensus mechanism, which makes its settlement extremely fast…Because of… https://t.co/HlnFrMhHiV pic.twitter.com/jkFA7bQAGs — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) May 16, 2025 XRP’s Transaction Model and Speed Advantage One of the primary points raised stems from a 2022 report titled First Demonstration Experiment for Energy Trading System EDISON-X using XRP Ledger. This document explains that the XRP Ledger utilizes a Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA) consensus mechanism, differing from Bitcoin and Ethereum’s energy-intensive systems. This allows XRP transactions to be confirmed in 3 to 5 seconds with minimal cost and high scalability. The same report noted the XRP Ledger’s environmental advantage, having achieved carbon neutrality in 2020. It also indicated that XRPL supports advanced use cases such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), positioning it for long-term utility beyond simple transfers. Industry Recognition and Institutional Endorsement Further support comes from discussions at DC Fintech Week, where experts emphasized the importance of functional cryptocurrencies in modern finance. XRP was identified as one of the few digital assets contributing meaningfully to financial innovation. Additionally, SMQKE referenced a report by Morgan Stanley highlighting XRP’s energy efficiency compared to Bitcoin. The bank’s research recognized that while XRP’s framework may lean toward centralization, it also mirrors some aspects of traditional banking, which could enhance regulatory compatibility and mainstream adoption. A separate analysis from Trade Finance Global further underscored the token’s role in cross-border payments. Describing XRP as a “Bitcoin for banks,” the report noted that Ripple’s infrastructure has already been adopted by several financial institutions aiming to modernize international money transfers.

The token was among the few crypto assets positioned to comply with this framework, potentially giving it a competitive edge in aligning with central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). The Asian Development Bank also contributed to the conversation, asserting that XRP—unlike many decentralized cryptocurrencies—often operates within formal financial systems. This distinction could help it integrate more seamlessly into the established financial infrastructure. Regulatory Insight and National Relevance In a 2018 letter addressed to the U.S. Federal Reserve, Brenden Sheehan, a concerned banking customer, advocated for the adoption of Ripple’s technology. He emphasized Ripple’s speed, security, and potential to enhance outdated American payment systems. His recommendation warned that without such upgrades, the U.S. risked falling behind other nations advancing in financial innovation. Lastly, a study by the Waterford Institute of Technology concluded that Ripple provides notable improvements over both the SWIFT network and Bitcoin’s architecture. The findings suggested that banks could adopt Ripple’s system to offer more efficient and reliable services to consumers and businesses. Drawing on these eight distinct documents, SMQKE argues that the asset has demonstrated the characteristics, institutional interest, and technological foundation necessary to potentially rival Bitcoin in global relevance. While the future remains uncertain, the evidence presented outlines a clear case for the token’s long-term potential in the evolving financial ecosystem.

This performance includes a 15% rise within 2025 alone, signaling a shift in market sentiment as the asset regains strength following years of legal uncertainty. As of now, XRP maintains a market capitalization of approximately $140 billion, giving it a 4.28% share of the total cryptocurrency market. The improved market outlook follows developments in the long-standing legal dispute between Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Both parties are reportedly nearing a settlement, with decisions to drop appeals suggesting a resolution is imminent. This development has increased investor confidence in XRP’s long-term potential. To better understand the possible trajectory of XRP over the next decade, forecasts from artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT and Grok, along with projections from crypto analysis platform Telegaon, have been reviewed. These forecasts account for a range of potential outcomes based on market growth, institutional adoption, and regulatory factors. Grok AI’s Outlook for XRP in 2035 Grok’s predictions consider XRP’s current fundamentals, including its partnerships with financial institutions, market capitalization, and its capped maximum supply of 100 billion tokens. According to Grok, if the total crypto market grows modestly to $5 trillion by 2035 and XRP’s dominance decreases to around 2–3%, its price could range between $6.60 and $8.37. This conservative outlook reflects potential challenges from competing platforms such as Stellar and the growing influence of stablecoins. In a more favorable scenario, Grok projects XRP could reach $45 to $60 per token. This optimistic view relies on several conditions: global crypto market growth to $20–25 trillion, XRP gaining an 8% market share, successful rollout of Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD , broader institutional integration, and the development of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based on XRP. ChatGPT’s Long-Term XRP Forecast ChatGPT also offers projections under varying market circumstances. In a bearish case, where market expansion is limited and regulatory pressures intensify, the model anticipates that XRP could trade between $3 and $5 by 2035. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 For a moderate scenario, where the market grows steadily and Ripple’s payment products achieve greater adoption across both institutional and retail sectors, XRP is expected to rise to between $10 and $15. In the most optimistic scenario, ChatGPT forecasts a price range of $25 to $50. This outcome is based on increased integration of XRP in central banking systems, enhanced smart contract capabilities on the XRP Ledger, and broader use cases including asset tokenization and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. Telegaon’s Aggressive Prediction Unlike the more measured approaches of the AI models, Telegaon has released a particularly bullish forecast. Their analysts anticipate XRP could reach a minimum price of $69.37 by 2035. The average estimate stands at $78.16, with the potential for a peak price of $87.49. These figures reflect Telegaon’s expectation of widespread institutional use and sustained market expansion over the next decade. While the projections for XRP vary widely based on different market conditions, all models indicate potential for significant growth over the next 10 years. The extent of this growth will depend on several factors, including regulatory clarity, adoption by financial institutions, and the overall performance of the cryptocurrency market.

Despite this double-digit price drop in the matter of just a few days, a certain technical indicator has flashed a buy signal, which could lead to a trend reversal. $XRP appears ready to rebound as the TD Sequential presents multiple buy signals on the hourly chart! pic.twitter.com/vnw7jgrZVq — Ali (@ali_charts) May 17, 2025 The chart by the popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez shows that the TD Sequential, which is used to determine the market exhaustion in either direction on various timeframes, has presented “multiple buy signals” on XRP’s hourly chart. This comes after Ripple’s token failed to overcome the aforementioned $2.7 resistance on Monday and Wednesday and dropped to $2.3 earlier today, which represented a price drop of over 12% in a few days. The price rejection aligned with Judge Torres’s decision to deny a joint motion filed by the US SEC and Ripple to end their lawsuit with an official settlement of $50 million. Previously, Martinez indicated that XRP didn’t have any major resistance obstacles on its way to $3 and beyond. However, he warned that the most critical support is at $2.38, which could spell further troubles for the asset if it falls below it—something that happened in the past 24 hours. What could also be regarded as a bearish sign is the lack of new users on the XRP network, since the average daily creation of new wallets sat at 3,500 a few days ago. According to Santiment, this number is far behind the leaders, Bitcoin (309,000 per day) and Ethereum (112,000 per day).

In a new press release , the DOJ says that it is charging an additional 12 defendants for allegedly participating in a crypto racketeering conspiracy that netted $263 million, bringing the total number of those accused to 14. While the majority of them have been arrested, two of them remain at large and are suspected to be in Dubai. They are all charged with RICO conspiracy, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, money laundering, and obstruction of justice. Last September, two California men – Malone Lam and Jeandiel Serrano – were arrested and charged in connection with the plot. Authorities say the men stole 4,100 Bitcoin ( BTC ) worth about $230 million at the time from an unnamed Washington, D.C., victim and then attempted to obfuscate and launder the funds using advanced techniques. According to the press release, the duo was not alone and had a team behind them composed of hackers, organizers, money launderers, callers, and residential burglars that targeted hard wallets, who met through online gaming platforms and were in operation since October 2023. The indictment reveals that the defendants used the stolen funds to purchase expensive luxury items, such as homes, cars, handbags, watches, jewelry, nights out at nightclubs ranging up to $500,000 per evening, as well as private security guards and private jets for members of the enterprise. If found guilty, the defendants would be handed a sentence determined by the court based on sentencing guidelines.

Senator Bill Hagerty has announced that the U.S. Senate is ready to pass the GENIUS Act next week. This bill would create the first official rules for stablecoins. His announcement comes as pressure mounts on lawmakers to bring regulatory clarity to the fast-growing digital asset space. Sen Hagerty Signals Green Light for Stablecoin Bill In a recent X post , Senator Bill Hagerty revealed that the Senate will make history when it passes the Guaranteed Essential National Infrastructure for Ubiquitous Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act. This new law is poised to establish the first-ever pro-growth regulatory framework for payment stablecoins in the United States. Senator Bill Hagerty, a close ally of President Donald Trump , has been one of the most vocal supporters of the stablecoin bill. He believes that passing the law is urgent and necessary to secure America’s role in the digital financial world. His optimism follows the Senate’s earlier failure to advance the bill, which drew widespread criticism and concern from the crypto community. Stablecoin Bill Aims to Protect the Dollar and Drive Growth Senator Hagerty said the bill will help maintain the U.S. dollar’s dominance in the global digital economy. Stablecoins are backed by U.S. Treasury bonds, which could boost demand for these bonds and help the U.S. economy grow. The bill also aims to ensure that American companies, not foreign ones, lead in creating digital payment systems. On the other hand, some people fear that if the bill is not approved, the U.S. might fall behind in the digital finance space. Lawyer John Deaton recently warned that without the GENIUS Act, crypto laws may not progress until 2029. He asserted that this would be a major setback for the industry. Bipartisan Support from Key Lawmakers Senator Kirsten Gillibrand also supports the GENIUS Act. She said it is important for the U.S. to pass laws that protect users while helping new ideas grow. She explained that stablecoins are already important in the global economy . The GENIUS Act, she said, gives clear rules, protects people, and helps keep the U.S. dollar strong. Gillibrand also said the bill is a true bipartisan effort, and she hopes it will pass soon. Looking forward, Senate Majority Leader John Thune has set a cloture vote for Monday. This vote will decide whether the Senate can continue working on the bill. If the vote is successful, the GENIUS Act could become a law soon, which would be an important move for stablecoins and digital money in the U.S. The post Senator Hagerty Says Historic Stablecoin Bill Will Pass Next Week appeared first on TheCoinrise.com .",Finance and Business News|Stablecoin regulation,EN,0,0,FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'The Coin Rise', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecoinrise.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecoinrise,2025-05-17 18:47:20

But if it drops below the neckline, it may signal bearish control, with the next support near $0.68.” Popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared similar sentiments that Cardano’s bon voyage to $1 would kick off if the ninth-largest cryptocurrency based on market capitalization breached major resistance at the $0.81 zone. Source: Ali Martinez According to CoinGecko data, ADA was up by 24.7% in the past month to hit $0.74 at the time of writing. As a top-ten cryptocurrency, Cardano is renowned as a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain network that emphasizes academic research, scalability, and sustainability. Therefore, it envisions an inclusive and transparent financial system where secure decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts take center stage. What are the Stakes of a Cardano ETF Going Live ? Since exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have become the talk of the crypto town, the chances of Cardano jumping on this bandwagon are being highly scrutinized. Per Polymarket data, the possiblity of a Cardano ETF seeing the light of day before the end of 2025 has jumped to 63%. ETFs present institutions with a powerful mix of strategic flexibility, cost-efficiency, transparency, ease of trading, and liquidity. A Cardano ETF would be embraced because it would trigger heightened institutional interest. Meanwhile, Cardano’s user base has been growing rapidly after a Brave browser partnership recently exposed it to 86 million users.",Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano,EN,0,0,ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TRADING|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-17 18:47:28

The full effects of the Trump administration’s tariffs on U.S. consumers are yet to be fully understood. One of the latest to feel the effects is Walmart. The retail giant recently announced it will raise its prices to combat tariff-related expenses. Trump tells Walmart to ‘eat the tariffs’ In a post on his social media platform, Truth Social, U.S. President Donald Trump took direct aim at Walmart, criticizing the company’s decision to raise prices in response to the U.S. tariffs on imported goods. Trump accused Walmart of hiding behind tariffs to justify price hikes. Source: Donald Trump (Truth Social) Walmart announced earlier this week that it will begin increasing prices later this month due to what it described as mounting tariff-related costs. In his post, Trump accused Walmart of hiding behind tariffs to justify price hikes and insisted that the company could afford to absorb the extra costs without passing them on to consumers. “Walmart should STOP trying to blame Tariffs as the reason for raising prices throughout the chain. Walmart made BILLIONS OF DOLLARS last year, far more than expected,” he wrote. “Between Walmart and China they should, as is said, ‘EAT THE TARIFFS,’ and not charge valued customers ANYTHING,” Trump added. Walmart has so far not commented on the president’s remarks. Tariff impact One major issue of the Trump administration so far has been the U.S.-China trade policy. Trump imposed a series of tariffs on Chinese imports, and critics have since warned about the consequences of the tariffs and the negative impact they would have on U.S. consumers. Trump’s remarks on Walmart come after the administration backed down on the Chinese tariffs earlier this week, lowering duties from 145% to 30% for 90 days. In response, China also lowered its retaliatory tariffs from 125% to 10%. Walmart, as the largest private employer in the U.S. and a pillar of the retail industry, has an influence over the industry. Smaller retailers may also hike prices, citing similar reasons. Walmart did not release a profit projection for the first quarter of 2025 due to economic uncertainty, but during an earnings call , Walmart’s CEO, Doug McMillon, highlighted concerns about narrow retail margins. McMillon shared that the company’s profits slipped in the first quarter of the year, to $4.45B or 56 cents per share, from $5.10B or 63 cents per share. While Walmart’s profits are indeed high, the cost of absorbing billions in tariff-related expenses could disrupt the company’s operations and force the retailer to make budget cuts elsewhere, such as wages, staffing, or supply chain investments.

This outlook comes despite current market uncertainty and declining investor confidence in the continuation of the ongoing crypto bull cycle. In a recent post on X, Modern Investor supported a forecast by fellow analyst VirtualBacon , who previously speculated that Ethereum could rise to $10,000 during this market cycle. Going further, Modern Investor predicted that Ethereum could potentially hit $15,000 before year-end. He emphasized that such a surge would likely have a positive impact on the valuation of other leading digital assets, including XRP. Apparently ETH is going to 10k this year. This means Cardano is going to 15$ and XRP will float towards 20$ https://t.co/V0aFX0EuXp — The Modern Investor (@ModernInvest) May 10, 2025 Implications for Token’s Price Trajectory Based on the projection that Ethereum will hit $10,000, Modern Investor believes XRP could rally significantly, setting a target price of $20 for the asset. This would represent a major increase from XRP’s current trading price , which stands at $2.37 at the time of reporting. Over the past 24 hours, XRP has declined by 1.12%, but remains up by 0.02% over the past week and 13.48% over the last month. On a yearly scale, XRP has appreciated by 356%, with a 14.2% gain recorded since the start of 2025. Currently, XRP holds a market capitalization of approximately $139.41 billion, ranking it as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency globally. For XRP to reach the projected $20 mark, it would need to increase in value by around 744%. If achieved, this price level would place XRP’s market cap at approximately $1.17 trillion, assuming the circulating supply remains stable at around 58.62 billion tokens. Potential Investor Returns and Market Sentiment A hypothetical portfolio of 50,000 XRP, valued at $118,500 at current prices, would be worth $1 million if the $20 target materializes. This underscores the level of returns that early investors could experience if the forecasted rally plays out as expected. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 While Modern Investor’s prediction adds to growing optimism, the $20 target has long been a topic of discussion within the community. Multiple analysts and platforms have previously speculated on when this milestone might be achieved. Previous Forecasts for XRP’s $20 Milestone Notably, the analyst known as XRP Shark projected in 2023 that XRP could reach between $20 and $33 by late 2025 or early 2026. This forecast was made when XRP was valued at just $0.39, indicating a strong belief in the asset’s long-term potential. Meanwhile, analysts from the cryptocurrency platform Changelly anticipate a longer timeline, suggesting XRP may not reach $20 until April 2030, five years from now. Another source, the crypto prediction site Telegaon , expects the token to trade near the $20 range by 2028. Although differing opinions exist on when XRP might hit the $20 mark, the consensus among bullish analysts is that a significant rise in Ethereum’s price could act as a catalyst for XRP’s upward movement. While market conditions remain volatile, expert sentiment continues to suggest that XRP has the potential for substantial growth in the years ahead.

Unilabs (UNIL) integrates artificial intelligence to provide a comprehensive DeFi asset management platform. With Unilabs, investors can access AI-powered portfolio management, transparent profit-sharing mechanisms, and early access to high-potential crypto projects. As SOL investors seek innovation beyond speed and scalability, this next-gen project combines AI with decentralized asset management. The move might redefine how investors interact with smart money in Web3. But does this new protocol live up to the hype, or is it just another overvalued project riding the AI wave? Keep reading to find out! Solana (SOL): The Speed King of DeFi, But Is It Enough? Solana (SOL) has seen increased investor interest due to its high transaction speed and low fees. These two vital components have propelled it to become a dominant player in NFT and DeFi ecosystems. SOL boosts an incredible developer community and a fast-growing total value locked (TVL). But more importantly, a growing roster of applications has proven it can scale better DeFi activity than Ethereum alternatives. Source: CoinMarketCap These phenomena have triggered the rise of the Solana price to new highs. After weathering the 2022 dip, the Solana price has grown strongly, jumping from under $10 to over $170 in early 2025. This Solana price spike has been fueled by renewed interest in high-throughput blockchain ecosystems. Many market insiders expect the Solana price to increase to $380 by the end of 2025, attributed to institutional interest and growing adoption in the NFT and DeFi sectors. While the Solana price performance cements investor confidence, its DeFi model relies heavily on transaction volume and speed. As AI-driven platforms emerge to provide real-time strategy optimization and algorithmic asset management, SOL’s static architecture may show its age, especially now that many investors are looking for the next generation of adjusted returns. This New Hedge Fund Could Reimagine Asset Management While the Solana price performance has been exceptional, its ecosystem’s flexibility and sustainability have received fresh scrutiny, especially when it comes to adapting to market volatility in real time. Unilabs has integrated machine learning and AI to introduce the first true AI native hedge fund on the blockchain. Unlike traditional platforms, Unilabs uses AI agents and machine learning to manage crypto portfolios in real time. As such, the platform can automatically rebalance, adapt to volatile markets, and identify emerging opportunities. Users will, therefore, get exposure to active fund strategies without centralized oversight. At its core, Unilabs offers AI-driven funds with diversified portfolios, sector-specific allocation, and early-stage crypto project exposure. They include: AI fund, RWA fund, Mining fund, and BTC fund. Even more interesting, investors can stake UNIL for governance rights and revenue share, and at the same time, benefit from the platform’s unique buyback model that redistributes protocol earnings. Unilabs is more than just passive returns for investors. It offers opportunities to join the robust AI economy, where capital is managed by algorithms designed for performance. With over $30 million in assets already under management and on-chain performance history, Unilabs is gaining traction among DeFi power users and Web3 hedge funds. Priced at a low entry of $0.0051 at its presale stage two, and raising over 400K, the project could become a key player in the next bull cycle. Can Unilabs Mirror 2021 Solana Price Performance? Solana has proven its value in the market, showcasing high speed, growing user adoption, and incredible SOL price performance. However, as the market matures, the next disruptor may not come from faster blockchains but from smarter ones. Unilabs represents this paradigm shift, providing a future where artificial intelligence takes center stage in portfolio management, investment strategy, and risk assessment. The protocol could be a turning point. While SOL continues to deliver efficiency and scale, Unilabs is quietly building a foundation for a more adaptive and intelligent DeFi experience. As the convergence between finance and AI continues to rise, platforms like Unilabs may not just complement traditional DeFi; they could redefine it.

This would mean that XRP could settle between the $5.10 and $6.28 price mark in the next five years. Institutional adoption, increased XRP usage in payments, and a potential ETF approval are all catalyzing factors.

Brave will allow users to send, receive, and swap Cardano from the wallet and browser. Brave has traditionally supported several cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum and Solana. Brave is currently branching out to include other tokens so that their users can enjoy multichain functionality. Cardano users can now interact with their token, such as participating in governance decisions, without having to use extensions. Brave users, therefore, will have added security because they won’t have to take risks with third-party Cardano extensions. “This collaboration with Brave”, said Charles Hoskinson, CEO of IO, “is a natural fit. We share a vision for a more secure, accessible, and user-respecting Web3. By bringing Cardano into Brave Wallet, we are expanding functionality for Cardano users in the age of on-chain governance and advancing a new standard for how blockchain networks should empower individuals, protecting privacy while enabling active, on-chain participation”. InputOutput (IO), a crypto startup, has partnered with Brave to produce the added functionality of a Cardano wallet. IO will take responsibility for adapting the Brave wallet to include Cardano’s features and take advantage of the privacy features within the Brave Browser. One feature that will be useful for Brave users in particular is the ability to swap Cardano tokens for other cryptocurrencies within Brave’s comfort zone. Charles Hoskinson, CEO of IO, believes that both Brave and Cardano share a similar vision for web3 technology and privacy-enhancing networks. Brendan Eich, CEO of Brave, is focused on improving the user experience and adding multichain functionality. This is a significant partnership for Cardano because more people can try out the token and see whether the network suits their privacy requirements. Brave Browser aims to be a web3-compliant browser with an inbuilt crypto wallet that allows users to interact with various crypto ecosystems with minimal effort. The browser also aims to increase security for the user and protect a user’s data from being exploited by companies and governments. Cardano seems to be a good fit for the Brave Browser because it has a web3 ecosystem that is carefully developed and has a large following. The Cardano team is very excited about the partnership because they will be able to create their token with the added support of Brave. In May, Cardano made a giant step in crypto development, collaborating with BitcoinOS to bridge Bitcoin to Cardano and then back again. Multichain development has become a hot topic for users because it improves the accessibility of tokens. BitcoinOS is a bridging company specializing in creating bridges between different blockchain ecosystems. A big part of the Cardano blockchain is the governance system that allows users to participate with the token.

In April, he issued an executive order asking his cabinet to identify coal-powered infrastructure that could support AI data centres and assess whether they can meet the energy demands of tech firms. Earlier in January, he also explained to the World Economic Forum that he would greenlight power plants for AI under an emergency order and encourage tech companies to use coal as a secondary energy source. Some tech industry leaders acknowledge they need fossil fuels to meet their energy demands According to the Energy Information Administration, coal emits more carbon dioxide per kilowatt hour than any other energy source. Thus, the tech industry has been investing more in renewable energy to maintain sustainability goals and reduce emissions. Nevertheless, tech companies’ new preference for renewable sources cost the coal industry greatly, with a number of coal plants already abandoned in the United States. In 2023, roughly 16% of electricity came from burning coal, down from 51% in 2001. However, Trump’s push for expansive coal use could change the downturn in statistics and prove productive for coal miners. Peabody Energy CEO James Grech, who attended Trump’s executive order ceremony at the White House, believes that coal plants can meet the nation’s electricity demands, including data centres’ energy needs. He argued that coal plants only supply about 42% of their maximum capacity at the moment and should augment the amount of power produced. Grech added, “We believe that all coal-powered generators need to defer US coal plant retirements as the situation on the ground has clearly changed. We believe generators should un-retire coal plants that have recently been mothballed.” Some in the tech industry have also recognised the need for fossil fuel to meet their AI power demands. However, some are leaning more towards natural gas than coal. Natural gas produces less than half the carbon dioxide of coal per kilowatt hour of power. Kevin Miller, Amazon’s vice president of global data centres, even claimed to get the energy they need, they’ll need to rely on thermal generation in the short term. At the Oklahoma City Conference, top executives from Amazon, Nvidia and Anthropic could not answer directly when asked whether they would use coal for electricity generation. Miller even argued that the use of coal would depend on the combination of power available and the possible alternatives. Trump and UAE leaders will build a data centre in Abu Dhabi President Trump and the United Arab Emirates have agreed to build a massive data centre in Abu Dhabi, which has about 5GW capacity and is the largest data center outside the US. The two countries want the centre to serve as a regional platform for US hyperscalers. According to the Commerce Department, the data centre will provide low latency services to almost 50% of the global population residing within 2,000 miles of the UAE. Trump has also signed several AI-related deals with Gulf countries . However, some US lawmakers were not too pleased with his decisions. For instance, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York criticized the president for backing deals that would transfer advanced US chip technology to Saudi Arabia and the UAE, accusing him of trading sensitive technology for unclear foreign investment pledges.

Claiming that the values of gold, silver and Bitcoin in particular will continue to rise, Kiyosaki cited the US Federal Reserve as the “collapse” as the reason for this. Stating that he continues to buy more Bitcoin, Kiyosaki stated that he expects the BTC price to reach $250,000 this year. In addition, the analyst claimed that Bitcoin is a better asset than silver or gold. The reason for this is that the maximum number of BTC that can be in circulation in history is limited to 21 million. He added that gold, silver mines and oil well owners can simply increase their production when the price of these assets increases, but this is not the case with Bitcoin.

According to data from CNBC, the rally started after tariffs reached their peak tension point in early April, which triggered the heaviest liquidation seen since the start of the year. That fear didn’t last. As soon as the Trump administration hinted at backing off the China tariff hikes, bulls piled back in and stocks lit up. The sell-off from February’s highs had already wiped out nearly a fifth of the index’s value. But technical traders had started calling the setup “so bad it’s good” — and they were right. From that intraday bottom, the S&P 500 exploded by 23%. By last Friday, it had reclaimed levels above the 200-day moving average and pushed past the April 2 “Liberation Day” closing price. It’s now back in the green for the year, sitting right above where it was the day after the 2020 election. Traders rotate fast as volatility crashes and momentum builds The market’s comeback wasn’t quiet. It’s been a straight-line grind higher, the kind of boring rally that signals strength, not weakness. Last week alone, the S&P 500 added 5.3%. Technical indicators triggered momentum and breadth signals that usually only go off during a real escape from a market bottom. The VIX, Wall Street’s fear gauge, plunged from 50 to under 20 faster than ever recorded. It ended the week at 17, a level that reflects calm instead of chaos. Retail names like Robinhood, Palantir, and CoreWeave have soared 50% to 60% since April 7. Robinhood and Palantir moved almost in sync. CoreWeave, which only IPO’d last month, is up nearly 60%. Nvidia spiked 16%. Meanwhile, social trading firm eToro, which went public last week after ditching its 2021 SPAC plans, jumped 20% right out of the gate. Stablecoin firm Circle, along with fintechs Klarna and Chime, have all filed to go public too. Brokerage and investment banking stocks as a group are back near their highs, riding the wave of investor confidence. Tariff retreat feeds bulls as AI and fiscal noise shape outlook The real fuel for the rally came when President Donald Trump backed away from his sky-high China tariffs. Warren Pies, chief investment officer at 3Fourteen Research, said the rebound is tracking similar to policy-driven bottoms seen in 1998, 2011, and late 2018. But this isn’t pure euphoria. Hedge funds and institutional investors are still underweight. Surveys of retail traders and financial advisors show sentiment barely above recent bearish lows. The energy from late 2024’s “animal spirits” is trying to restart, but hasn’t fully ignited yet. Some of the volatility in April wasn’t about tariffs at all. The first dip came after momentum tech names reversed sharply when DeepSeek’s AI challenge threw off the usual order. But since then, most major platforms have doubled down on capex, and the AI story is back in business. Big names are inching back to their highs. The Nasdaq Composite, since ChatGPT launched, has eerily followed the same pattern it took after Netscape’s debut in 1994. By 1997, it had tripled. No one’s betting on a repeat just yet, but the resemblance hasn’t gone unnoticed. As for tariffs, their impact could still change the game. The US trade deficit with China is just 1% of GDP. China’s exports to the US make up 3% of its economy. But even small disruptions create confusion. If those tensions linger, they could drag on jobs and housing, which are already slowing. And now the “free pass” zone is over. The next wave of economic data will hit harder. Valuation-wise, the S&P 500 is trading at 21.5 times forecast earnings over the next year. That’s high. It’s not crisis-high, but it’s uncomfortable. Back in February, it hit 22x—above that, and markets usually want more than just talk.

Capturing 50% of Tether’s market cap could push XRP above $4 amid strong demand. Technical indicators show bullish momentum, reinforcing XRP’s breakout potential. The Stablecoin GENIUS Act is anticipated for a U.S. Senate vote next week. Market analysts suggest this development could become a game-changer for Ripple’s ecosystem, especially its stablecoin RLUSD. This legislative action, according to the analysis outlined in the report, may create significant benefits for RLUSD, potentially allowing it to take a large share of the global stablecoin market. If RLUSD reaches 50% of Tether’s current $150 billion market cap, the implications for XRP could be transformative. A surge in RLUSD adoption would not only solidify Ripple’s position in the digital payments space but also provide the momentum needed to push XRP to new all-time highs.

Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau announced on May 16 a coordinated government response to what he described as a growing threat to the industry leaders. “All these repeated kidnappings of experts in the crypto sector will be fought using precise instruments, both immediate and short-term, to discourage, deter and hinder for the protection of the industry,” Retailleau informed a press conference. This follows an upsurge of disturbing attacks where big crypto figures and their relatives were targeted by criminals requesting cryptocurrency payments in exchange for their freedom. High-Profile Attacks Trigger Urgency The latest incident happened earlier this week in central Paris, where Pierre Noizat’s daughter, head of French crypto exchange Paymium, was attempted to be kidnapped by masked men. The attempt was unsuccessful, but it was the third serious attack on a crypto executive in France this year. In yet another horror case last year, 2024, David Balland, co-founder of cryptocurrency storage wallet firm Ledger, was kidnapped along with his wife. The two were held for ransom, and Balland was also brutally assaulted, including being mutilated, before he was rescued by police. Ten suspects were arrested, some of whom had demanded cryptocurrency in return for their freedom. France Becomes a Target Éric Larchevêque, one of the founders of Ledger, attended a high-level meeting with Retailleau and representatives from the police. He highlighted the gravity of the threat, stating that of around 50 attacks known to have been endured by crypto bosses globally in the past year, 14 occurred in France alone. “France has become the epicenter for crypto kidnappings,” Larchevêque explained, and added the government’s willingness to act as a step to counter this threatening trend. Government Action Underway Government officials are purportedly developing an overarching plan that addresses direct protection for vulnerable persons, greater cooperation between crypto companies and law enforcement agencies, and specialized training for police departments dealing with digital finance crime. They are also examining legal reforms to increase punishments for technology-targeted violence and ransom payments in cryptocurrency. While the crypto sector continues to grow and attract wealth, authorities say that criminal targeting of its leaders can only surge. The recent move by the government is meant to meet the requirement of promoting innovation with protecting public safety. France’s reaction can be a model for others threatened in the same way, inaugurating an age of security consciousness in the cyber world of finance.",Blockchain|Regulation,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|WALLET,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-05-17 19:47:00

While Ethereum (ETH) has surged over 50% from April’s lows, hitting $3,000 is contingent on holding support at $2,468. Similarly, Chainlink (LINK) is up and has solid targets near $24, but it needs to break past $17.80 and hold key support for further gains. BlockDAG is taking a different route, already raising over $253 million in its presale and heading toward $600 million. With a 2,520% increase so far, it’s clear the momentum is real. Right now, you can enter at just $0.0020, well below its confirmed launch price of $0.05. With a steady rise and a strong foundation, BlockDAG is positioning itself as one of the top cryptos to buy in 2025! Ethereum Targets $3K as Institutional Demand Picks Up Ethereum (ETH) has made a strong comeback, rising over 50% from its April lows and pushing past the $2,600 mark. This surge is driven by two key factors: robust institutional buying and the successful launch of the Pectra upgrade. London’s Abraxas Capital has been a major player, snapping up more than $477 million in ETH within just six days. At the same time, Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade has sparked renewed interest from long-term investors. With technicals showing potential for more gains, analysts are now eyeing $3,000 as the next big milestone, assuming ETH can maintain support above $2,468. It’s shaping up to be an exciting time for Ethereum! Chainlink at $16.67: $20 Target in Sight Chainlink (LINK) is on a strong run, currently priced at $16.67, marking a nearly 25% gain over the past week. This momentum fits nicely with a steady upward trend, thanks to an ascending channel that’s been intact since April. If LINK manages to break through the crucial resistance at $17.80, analysts predict a move toward $20, with even higher targets at $22.50 and $24. The outlook for Chainlink’s price depends on maintaining strong volume and growing demand for decentralized oracle solutions. As long as LINK stays above the $15.80 support, it’s likely to keep heading higher. BlockDAG Chases $600M as Price Forecasts Grow Louder BlockDAG’s presale is taking the market by storm, with nearly $253 million raised and more than 20.6 billion coins sold so far. But it’s not slowing down anytime soon. The presale’s target of $600 million now feels like an inevitability, as demand continues to surge. What’s truly impressive is the momentum BlockDAG is maintaining throughout its presale. With 150 million BDAG coins up for grabs daily in the Buyer Battles, it’s clear that the demand for BDAG is strong. Not many presales see this level of sustained interest, let alone with such a solid technical foundation in place. The project has already undergone a thorough CertiK audit, one of the most respected names in blockchain security. Coupled with an extensive roadmap and a growing list of confirmed exchanges, BlockDAG’s growth is clearly strategic, not rushed. The price action tells a similar story. Starting at just $0.001 in presale batch 1, BDAG has soared to $0.0262 in batch 28, a 2,520% increase. With the confirmed launch price at $0.05, many are eyeing long-term projections that could see BDAG hit $1, and eventually $5 or even $10. For those looking to get in before the next jump, a limited-time special price of $0.0020 is available until June 13. With such a strong track record and impressive projections, it’s not just about hoping for future growth, it’s about joining something with a clear path forward. Final Thoughts Ethereum’s (ETH) price has been on a strong run, rising over 50% since April’s lows, fueled by $477 million in institutional buying. Analysts are now eyeing the $3,000 mark if ETH holds its support at $2,468. Similarly, Chainlink (LINK) has seen a 25% boost this week, with a potential breakout above $17.80 possibly sending it toward $20 or higher. However, BlockDAG is moving at a different pace. With $253 million raised and a $600 million presale target in sight, it’s all about scaling before launch. Offering an exclusive price of $0.0020, significantly lower than its current batch price of $0.0262, BlockDAG is primed for major growth. Add in 20 upcoming exchange listings and a 2,520% surge from its first batch, and BlockDAG is shaping up to be one of the top crypto picks for 2025.

On Thursday, the Shenzhen-based Addentax Group Corp. announced plans to issue shares of its common stock to buy 8,000 BTC and acquire undefined amounts of other crypto assets, including President Donald Trump’s official memecoin ( TRUMP ). The firm’s shares, listed on the Nasdaq as ATXG, were priced at $0.72 before the announcement but quickly jumped to a high of $1.68 later that day. The stock then promptly retraced and dipped even lower than its original price and is now trading at $0.61. ATXG is down nearly 9% in the past 24 hours and more than 20% in the past five days. Addentax specializes in garment manufacturing, logistics services, property management and subleasing. The firm notes it has been in discussions “with a number of substantial and influential Bitcoin and other mainstream cryptocurrency holders” to facilitate the upcoming acquisitions. Addentax chief executive Hong Zhida says the investments are part of the firm’s “broader blockchain strategy.” “We believe that certain established digital assets may serve as a stable component of the company’s long-term holdings, given their liquidity and increasing institutional interest over recent years.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

These developments are grabbing attention, but there’s another project making waves for a very different reason: Unstaked . Now in stage 13, the Unstaked presale has reached a price of $0.00926 and collected $6 million so far, with a staggering $2 million raised in just two days. On top of that, the team has introduced a $1 million giveaway, users only need to purchase $100 or more in $UNSD and complete a few easy steps. But what’s really sparking interest is the momentum.

Unstaked’s Presale Momentum Builds as $1M Giveaway Goes Viral Unstaked is set to bring massive profits for holders without unnecessary complications. The project’s $1 million giveaway is now live, accessible to anyone who purchases at least $100 of $UNSD during the presale and follows simple participation steps. But this giveaway isn’t the only reason behind the fast-growing interest. Buyers are also rushing in because the presale is accelerating. Stage 13 pricing now stands at $0.00926, with total funding surpassing $6 million, $2 million of that came in just 48 hours. The pace and enthusiasm reflect genuine belief in what the team is building. Analysts say $UNSD could potentially reach $5 post-launch and deliver a return of nearly 600x from current levels. This belief is based on the platform’s AI agent tools that will assist in chat moderation, content creation, and managing communities. These systems are still being built and will only go live after the presale ends and the project launches. The anticipation of this rollout is what’s giving early buyers confidence. Unstaked also has zero VC involvement, a strong structure, and clearly defined features, making it a standout among current crypto offerings. If its growth continues, this could become one of the most successful presales of 2025. Dogecoin (DOGE) Bullish Run Gathers Strength with ETF Hopes DOGE recently touched $0.25 before facing resistance, pulling back slightly to around $0.224. Despite the dip, projections still remain positive with targets near $0.6533 and possibly reaching $1.25. Driving this optimism is the potential Dogecoin ETF, with Bitwise reportedly aiming to launch by April 2025. If approved, this could inject large-scale interest into DOGE. Despite Elon Musk shifting focus back to Tesla and stepping away from DOGE-related discussions, market momentum hasn’t faded. Forecasts for DOGE’s 2025 peak range between $0.731 and $2, depending on broader market conditions. With strong community engagement and renewed institutional attention, DOGE remains one to watch over the coming months. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Move Signals Possible Upside Breakout SHIB has crossed the $0.000016 resistance level, gaining renewed interest as it trades around $0.0000153. Analysts are eyeing a potential move toward $0.0000175 and higher. Ongoing burn activity has cut the circulating supply, adding strength to SHIB’s technical outlook. With a strong 0.82 correlation to Bitcoin, SHIB is also benefiting from BTC’s current recovery. Further gains for SHIB could be driven by larger market shifts or an uptick in burn volume. Some forecasts see SHIB reaching $0.00004136 by October and possibly $0.0000666 by year-end. Strong Bitcoin momentum, growing online support, and improvements in usability may continue to push SHIB upward through the rest of 2025. Final Thoughts! DOGE is gaining support on hopes for an ETF and higher price projections, while SHIB is showing technical strength after breaking past resistance. Yet, while both coins thrive on sentiment and market moves, Unstaked is gaining interest through solid delivery and real milestones. Its presale has already hit $6 million in total funds, including $2 million in just two days. At a price of $0.00926 and now in stage 13, Unstaked is turning heads, with analysts citing a $5 post-launch price goal. Its AI tools are still in the works and will activate after the official launch, giving current buyers early access to potential growth. With no VC control, a $1M giveaway live now, and clear features already outlined, Unstaked is rising fast as one of the top crypto coins to follow in 2025.

Starting January 1, 2026, every crypto firm operating in the country must report detailed user and transaction data. The move is part of a global plan to reduce tax evasion and bring crypto into the same light as traditional finance. Notably, the new change applies only to local firms; foreign platforms with UK customers must also comply. UK Adopts Global Crypto Rules The UK government is now following global rules for crypto by adopting the Crypto Asset Reporting Framework (CARF). This new step aims to make crypto more transparent and stop people from hiding money or avoiding taxes. The UK tax authority will now require crypto platforms to collect and report detailed user information, such as full legal names, addresses, tax identification numbers, and specifics about each transaction. This also includes the type, value, and volume of assets and the nature of every crypto-related activity. This applies to every trade, transfer, or activity involving a UK user or a user from any other country following CARF rules. Notably, the UK is handling crypto differently from the EU’s new Markets in Crypto-Assets ( MiCA) rules. Instead of creating a separate system for lending, borrowing, staking, and stablecoins, the UK authority is incorporating crypto services into its current financial laws. Government Urges Crypto Platforms To Start Preparing Crypto platforms will not just collect information. They must report it to the UK government, ensuring that no transaction goes unseen. Even foreign-based firms, like Galaxy Digital , Coinbase , must meet these standards as long as they serve UK clients. Any mistakes or missing data could lead to penalties of up to £300 per user. Though the rules will not be enforced until 2026, authorities are urging firms to begin data collection now. Early preparation is expected to prevent compliance issues down the road. UK Plans Stricter Crypto Rules to Support Safe Growth UK authorities say this is not just about control. It is about protecting users, boosting trust, and building a better crypto industry. During UK Fintech Week in April, Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the country will continue to promote fintech and crypto growth but with more careful oversight. The government is also drafting new laws to regulate crypto exchanges, dealers, and custodians more strictly. This will improve how these firms operate and ensure stronger consumer protection. In addition, the UK is looking beyond its borders. Officials recently floated the idea of a “transatlantic sandbox” for digital assets. This initiative would let firms test crypto products in both the UK and US under shared rules. This proposal is part of the UK’s “ Plan for Change economic agenda,” the government’s broader effort to lead in financial innovation.

Industry analysts and seasoned traders monitoring pre-sale trends have already begun accumulating quietly, signaling growing confidence in the project’s potential. Meanwhile, retail participation continues to rise significantly each week, driven by compelling fundamentals, a strong brand identity, and an expanding community that’s gaining momentum. This consistent pattern of accumulation is often indicative of long-term viability and market resilience.

Presale growth has been relentless. Community engagement is rising fast, and the number of unique buyers continues to climb — a powerful sign that this is not a fluke or trend-based hype , but a real grassroots crypto movement.

CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT This Quiet Move Won’t Stay Quiet for Long MAGACOIN FINANCE is still early — but not for long.

Low-cost cryptos are catching attention ahead of a potential market upswing, with potential to deliver massive returns. Table of Contents XYZVerse starts a new wave: Is this the next 50x memecoin? Terra Classic Stellar Conclusion As the cryptocurrency market braces for a potential upswing, some inexpensive digital coins are gaining attention. These low-cost cryptos might offer returns that outperform traditional commodities. Could investing in them lead to substantial wealth in the next market surge? This article explores three such cryptocurrencies that could present significant opportunities. You might also like: XYZVerse could surge to $25 according to top trader, smashing past DOGE and XRP XYZVerse starts a new wave: Is this the next 50x memecoin? The excitement around XYZVerse is picking up speed. It’s positioned to become a major breakout in the memecoin arena, with a bold goal of delivering 50x returns post-launch. Currently in presale, early adopters have the opportunity to purchase XYZ tokens at a heavily discounted rate — well below the expected listing price. Market sentiment: Bullish on XYZ XYZVerse has already made its way onto CoinMarketCap, where the sentiment is overwhelmingly positive. Over 95% of community voters believe XYZ has significant growth ahead. The coin has also been spotlighted by well-known crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster, who boasts nearly 800,000 followers, recently gave the project a shoutout, labeling it a “moonshot in the making.” More than just hype — A new kind of memecoin While most meme tokens rely on short-lived hype, XYZVerse is doing things differently. It’s merging the adrenaline of the sports world with the virality of meme culture — and it’s clearly resonating. The presale is moving fast, with investors locking in at early-stage pricing they believe could be a fraction of future value. At the time of writing, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is rapidly rising. The price has climbed from $0.0001 (Stage 1) to $0.003333 (Stage 12), and over 70% of the $15 million target has already been raised. Those who got in early are already sitting on serious potential upside — and with a final presale price set at $0.10, the market is paying close attention. There’s still time to join before the presale ends Beyond the hype, XYZVerse is backed by a well-thought-out tokenomics structure designed for long-term sustainability. 15% of the token supply is dedicated to liquidity to support a strong trading foundation post-launch. 10% is reserved for community rewards, including airdrops and engagement bonuses. A substantial 17.13% is earmarked for token burns — adding a deflationary element that could fuel future demand. Community-first vision with real utility One of XYZVerse’s biggest strengths lies in its grassroots engagement. The team has launched an Ambassador Program that rewards users with free tokens for spreading awareness and supporting the ecosystem. But that’s just the start — discussions are underway with high-profile sports figures to drive even more visibility. A recent partnership with the decentralized sportsbook bookmaker.XYZ signals XYZVerse’s move toward real-world utility. This isn’t just a theoretical roadmap — the project is already delivering features that holders can benefit from. By uniting sports fans and crypto enthusiasts, XYZVerse is creating something fresh — a project that combines entertainment, engagement, and opportunity. Is XYZVerse the next big memecoin to watch? With strong presale momentum, growing community support, and a forward-looking roadmap, XYZVerse has the potential to become a major player in the meme coin space. While crypto is always a high-risk game, many see this project as a chance to catch something early — before it hits the mainstream. Don’t sleep on XYZVerse. The next bull wave might already be forming. Terra Classic Terra Classic LUNC has seen notable price movements lately. In the past week, the price increased by 9.97%, and over the last month, it rose by 11.12%, showing short-term gains. However, over six months, the price fell by 36.85%, indicating a longer-term decline. LUNC is currently trading between $0.00006012 and $0.00007493. The nearest resistance is $0.00008051; breaking above this could lead towards $0.00009532. The nearest support is at $0.00005089, with a secondary support at $0.00003608. An RSI of 26.69 and stochastic at 5.28 suggest oversold conditions, hinting at a possible price rebound. Based on these indicators, LUNC may be set for a price increase. If the price climbs to the nearest resistance, it would be about a 10% gain. Conversely, if it falls to the support level, it could drop by around 15%. Traders are watching these levels to assess LUNC’s potential movement. Stellar Stellar (XLM) has experienced significant growth recently. In the past week, its price increased by over 13%. In the last month, it went up by more than 23%. Looking back six months, XLM’s price has more than doubled, with an increase of over 100%. Currently, XLM trades between $0.26 and $0.34. The nearest resistance is at $0.37. If it breaks this level, the next resistance is at $0.44. On the downside, the nearest support is at $0.22, followed by $0.15. These levels are key for monitoring price movements. Technical indicators suggest a possible upward trend. The Relative Strength Index is around 33, indicating that XLM may be oversold. The Stochastic oscillator is also low, reinforcing this view. The MACD is slightly negative, showing recent downward pressure. If the price rebounds from oversold conditions, it could rise toward the resistance levels, potentially gaining another 10% to 20%. Conclusion While LUNC and XLM are promising, XYZVerse stands out this bull run, uniting sports fans in a memecoin offers somewhat bigger upside potential.
