But with Sui-based ETFs gaining traction, another project on the Binance Smart Chain is making waves for its unconventional model and early-stage community incentives. The King of Pigs ($KOPS) , a meme token initiative, is heading to the market with its ICO launch. Many experts suggest it’s time to throw the focus on the memecoin market after knowing the dynamics of KOPS. The development team has taken initiatives to take the purpose of the token to the next level. KOPS ICO, Community Building, and Open Airdrop The KOPS team has confirmed that the project remains in its pre-launch stage, with preparations already underway for its eventual future initial coin offering. Although a date has not yet been scheduled, the team is already busy building its online community. According to their roadmap, the objective is to onboard 10,000 community members, known internally as “warriors.” At the same time, a surprise airdrop has been launched for early participants. This initiative remains open, and according to the project’s communication, early contributors still have a chance to claim profits. The $500k mega airdrop is currently live and is available for early believers to enter he pigdom. Features Behind $KOPS Ecosystem Like any other memecoin , the $KOPS community encourages humour and purpose at the same time. While it delivers entertainment and viral content, a portion of its revenue is dedicated to supporting animal welfare causes. By strategically leveraging meme culture through contests, influencer collaborations, and viral challenges, $KOPS is positioning itself as a powerful and lasting force in the crypto space. In addition to this, token holders can also participate in project governance by voting on proposals that determine the future of the platform. The KOPS team also announced that a portion of each transaction fee is donated to animal welfare charities. This aspect adds a cause-based element to the memecoin’s utility, adding social impact to its ecosystem. BSC Infrastructure and Social Campaigns KOPS token is developed on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), which is an infrastructure that facilitates zero fees on trading and quick transaction processing. The infrastructure also supports interoperability with other BSC-based applications, making usability widespread. To promote visibility, KOPS is also running multiple community events. As announced in an official X post, the team is launching a ‘UGC CONTEST’ featuring a prize pool of 85,000,000 $KOPS. This initiative is part of a larger strategy to drive organic growth by promoting user-generated content. With a strict anti-spam and anti-bot policy in place, the project ensures genuine community engagement. https://twitter.com/TheKingofPigs_/status/1922229570440462628 To get more details about the UGC contest, you need to become a part of the Telegram community , where you can get the topic. If you are a creative mind with a unique skill of storytelling, the one entry you make here could be your life-changing step. The contest would happen for 30 days. So, hurry up and make your entries there as per the instructions provided by the $KOPS development team . The team announced that their tokenomics model is designed to achieve a balance between long-term utility and user incentives. With a high total supply, the system fosters active participation based on fairness, transparency, and sustainability. By incorporating gamified features, on-chain governance, and charity elements, KOPS aims to position itself as a purpose-driven, community-driven memecoin. As Sui’s attention persists with institutional ETF filings, KOPS is providing a differing approach centered on engagement, blockchain integration, and early-stage incentives. The Premium Update The KOPS team is entering the market with a bang, and it’s time for you to grab the golden opportunity. The ICO event is going to happen, and it’s time for investors and traders to keep their wallets funded.

As attention focuses on ETH, a new opportunity is unfolding. Unilabs, an AI-powered crypto asset manager, has launched four innovative funds and is making waves across DeFi with its live presale and growing traction in the market. Unilabs Quietly Builds While Markets Watch ETH Unilabs is not just another token; it is the first AI-backed digital asset manager with over $30 million in assets under management (AUM). Its goal is simple: remove human error and emotional bias from crypto investing by using artificial intelligence to manage diversified crypto portfolios. Think of it like a decentralized BlackRock, offering curated investment baskets designed by machine-learning algorithms instead of human fund managers. These baskets are segmented across four major funds: the AI Fund, BTC Fund, RWA Fund, and Mining Fund. Each fund is operated by real-time AI models that constantly rebalance based on market volatility, risk appetite, and sector performance. Unilabs’ AI doesn’t just track charts; it evaluates memecoin spikes, real-world asset (RWA) trends, and DeFi innovations simultaneously, enabling investors to tap into high-performance segments of the market. Presale Heats Up: 8,000 Join Unilabs As the Ethereum price surges, Unilabs is experiencing its own quiet boom. Over 8,000 new investors have already joined the presale, which offers UNIL tokens at discounted tiers before they hit public exchanges. Currently in early access, the presale enables users to purchase UNIL at below-market rates, with added incentives for staking and referrals. Over 20% of Unilabs tokens in Stage 2 have been sold, raising more than $300K. At the current price of $0.0051, buyers can secure a 21.5% ROI before the next stage increase to $0.0062, without even waiting for market listing. With 80 million $UNI already allocated, this is shaping up to be the best presale for early investors seeking discounted entry and high upside potential, especially ahead of possible price surges on DEX or CEX listings. UNIL is both a utility and governance token. Investors can stake it to earn passive income with variable ROI while also participating in fund governance and decision-making. Ethereum Price Surges: But Where Is the Smart Capital Going? The Ethereum price has taken off by a whopping 44% over the last six days, spiking from $1,800 to $2,600, primarily because of Abraxas Capital’s dramatic buying of ETH in huge amounts. The London-based investment firm acquired between $399 million and $695 million in ETH. Lookonchain data confirms massive exchange withdrawals that historically coincide with sharp price spikes. This institutional action didn’t just move ETH; it signaled growing confidence in digital assets from major capital pools. Source : CoinMarketCap While the Ethereum price rally captivated headlines, data reveals increased volatility in DeFi markets, potentially opening doors for algorithm-driven platforms like Unilabs. Unlike ETH, which requires individual investor decisions or staking in separate protocols, Unilabs offers consolidated fund exposure, where AI reallocates capital dynamically. As Ethereum price movements become increasingly influenced by institutional actors, platforms like Unilabs allow retail investors to ride the wave using hedge-fund-grade logic without needing insider access. Conclusion While the Ethereum price continues to rise on the back of institutional interest like Abraxas Capital’s $477M buy, Unilabs offers a rare ground-floor opportunity. With four powerful funds, $30M in managed assets, and over 8,000 new users onboarded during the presale, this is not just another project; it’s an ecosystem designed for long-term, intelligent growth. The presale is live, and pricing tiers are climbing with each new milestone. Investors are looking for more than hype. Those seeking structured portfolios, AI-driven returns, and passive staking income are already moving in. History has shown that those who get in early, whether with ETH, Solana, or Dogecoin, benefit the most. Unilabs is writing its own chapter now. The only question is, will you be part of it?

The Future New Orders diffusion index leapt by forty-plus points, a move that Julien Bittel, head of macro research at Global Macro Investor (GMI), called “literally” historic. Crypto Bulls Can Rejoice Bittel’s commentary on X framed the print with statistical precision: “Philly Fed data for May dropped yesterday – and the Future New Orders index just made history. Literally. … Expectations for new orders posted the largest monthly spike ever recorded – going all the way back to the index’s inception in May 1968. A staggering +4.3 standard deviation move. He underlined the shock with a comparison few macro watchers will forget: For perspective: that’s an even bigger move up than the downside collapse during the depths of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis (-4.1σ). Let that sink in…” Bittel then set the surge in a broader narrative that has animated his research since late last year. “Q1 growth was weak. The reason is straightforward – financial conditions tightened sharply in Q4. The dollar ripped, bond yields surged… a classic tightening phase,” he wrote. Related Reading: Analysis: Crypto Heats Up As $35 Billion Enters Market In Under A Month The proximate trigger, in his telling, was “businesses panic‑loading inventories ahead of Trump tariffs, and markets front‑running the inflation narrative.” Those dynamics, he argued, are a replay of Donald Trump’s first term: “We’ve highlighted repeatedly: this had all the hallmarks of Q4 2016 during Trump’s first term. Just like early 2017, that tightening spilled over into slower growth momentum in Q1.” Where 2017 began with doubt and ended in a synchronous global boom, Bittel believes 2025 is rhyming. “Those Q1 headwinds have flipped into Q2 tailwinds,” he insisted. “Everything flows downstream from changes in financial conditions… Purchasing managers’ expectations are shifting – and shifts in thinking eventually translate into action. Sentiment shifts first. Action follows. It always does. Bullish.” The crypto market responded muted. Bitcoin reclaimed the $104,000 level in early‑European trade, but lost it later on. Ether steadied near $2,600, and high‑beta layer‑one tokens such as Solana and Avalanche moved in tandem. Related Reading: Ethereum Gains Momentum Amid Flat Funding Rates – Is This A Healthy Uptrend? Giancarlo Cudrig, head of markets at Immutable, said the scale of the shock is less important than how under‑positioned investors are for an upside growth surprise. “An upside economic shock like this – +4.3σ on new orders – is rare. But the bigger story is market positioning. Asset prices are not prepared. The melt‑up is the asymmetric risk. Now it’s being repriced.” Independent analyst Market Heretic struck a similar note on X: “When this dropped, markets didn’t even blink. Because the shift’s already in motion. This wasn’t news, it was confirmation. That’s the real tell, when markets shrug off a four‑sigma upside shock. It means the turn is already upon us – and it’s just getting started.” For crypto investors, the implications are immediate. A softer dollar and retreating real‑yield expectations reduce the opportunity cost of holding non‑yielding assets, while the early phase of a reflationary turn historically favours high‑beta exposures. Bittel’s own playbook is unambiguous: “Sentiment shifts first. Action follows.” As long as that chain reaction continues, the crypto bulls appear to have both math and momentum on their side. At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $3.28 trillion.

These meme coins transformed modest investments into life-changing returns during previous market cycles. Now, in mid- 2025 , retail attention is swinging back toward the meme sector—and a new question is emerging: can MAGACOINFINANCE deliver a similar story? While SHIBA and DOGE remain influential, cracks are forming. SHIBA has faced setbacks following the departure of its key developer, Shytoshi Kusama , while DOGE is riding renewed optimism tied to stable prices, community growth, and potential celebrity endorsements. Still, seasoned meme coin holders are now eyeing earlier-stage plays like MAGACOINFINANCE for outsized return potential. SMART MONEY IS LOADING UP – ACT NOW SHIBA and DOGE: Veteran Players Prepare for a Second Wind SHIBA currently trades at $0.00002 with a market cap of around $12.9 billion , maintaining strong exchange volume (~$445 million daily). Despite developer exits and internal headwinds, SHIBA remains anchored in meme coin consciousness, bolstered by persistent community engagement and speculation-driven buyers. DOGE , meanwhile, has surprised many in 2025. With prices ranging between $0.15 and $0.20 , DOGE is eyeing a climb toward upper resistance around $0.29 to $0.41 . Its strength lies in its branding, widespread exchange access, and continued cultural relevance—fueled in part by figures like Elon Musk and Tesla references. It may lack formal roadmaps, but DOGE thrives on momentum. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT MAGACOINFINANCE Emerges as the Early-Stage Challenger In a meme coin cycle where timing is everything, MAGACOINFINANCE stands out—not for what it is today, but what it could become. Like DOGE in 2014 and SHIBA in 2020 , it offers early adopters exposure at the point where the biggest moves historically begin. Its combination of political meme culture and strong branding has caught the eye of crypto influencers, Telegram traders, and speculative buyers familiar with meme-driven trajectories. It hasn’t hit mainstream listings yet—but behind the scenes, its community is growing fast. On-Chain Signals Suggest Institutional Curiosity Blockchain activity is showing early signs of traction. Wallet analysis highlights the emergence of larger holder addresses, with accumulation by speculators and tracking from several whale-watching communities. Meanwhile, MAGACOINFINANCE is seeing increased mentions across meme-themed forums, further supporting its quiet momentum buildup. While it’s too early to predict long-term performance, the alignment of investor sentiment, cultural timing, and low entry pricing makes MAGACOINFINANCE a clear contender in the current meme rotation wave. LIMITED TIME OFFER-GET 50% EXTRA BONUS WITH MAGA50X Conclusion: Meme Coins Are Back—But the Playbook Has Changed As we enter summer 2025, meme coin enthusiasm is returning. But the landscape has evolved. SHIBA and DOGE remain favorites for those seeking nostalgia and relative stability. MAGACOINFINANCE , by contrast, is drawing the risk-tolerant crowd—those hunting for outsized upside at the start of a narrative. For those who made fortunes in the last cycle, the question isn’t whether meme coins will run—it’s which one will run first. MAGACOINFINANCE may just be that coin.

DOGE has shown long-term resilience. SHIBA offers potential upside with volatility. MAGACOINFINANCE is earlier-stage, carrying more risk—but possibly higher reward. Q: Can SHIBA reach a new all-time high in 2025? Analysts say yes—especially if retail interest surges. Targets near $0.00008 are possible under strong market conditions.

According to the university’s ongoing Surveys of Consumers, the Index of Consumer Sentiment dropped to 50.8 this month, the second-lowest rating ever recorded. The lowest rating ever recorded was 50 in June 2022. The survey began in November 1952. Said Surveys of Consumers Director Joanne Hsu, “Consumer sentiment was essentially unchanged this month, inching down a scant 1.4 index points following four consecutive months of steep declines. Sentiment is now down almost 30% since January 2025. Slight increases in sentiment this month for independents were offset by a 7% decline among Republicans.” The survey also finds that consumer assessments of personal finances fell by 10%, anticipating weaker incomes and a weaker economy ahead. “Tariffs were spontaneously mentioned by nearly three-quarters of consumers, up from almost 60% in April; uncertainty over trade policy continues to dominate consumers’ thinking about the economy.” With Trump’s tariff wars creating uncertainty, the University of Michigan survey finds that inflation expectations are experiencing a bipartisan surge. “Year-ahead inflation expectations surged from 6.5% last month to 7.3% this month. This month’s rise was seen among Democrats and Republicans alike. Long-run inflation expectations lifted from 4.4% in April to 4.6% in May, reflecting a particularly large monthly jump among Republicans.” Source: University of Michigan Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The MUSD stablecoin, backed by cash and U.S. Treasuries, and running on the eCash blockchain, is designed to help Tinian diversify its economy. The stablecoin legislation also authorizes internet casino licensing, strategically linking blockchain technology with tourism and online gaming. Tinian, a small island in the U.S. Pacific territory of the Northern Mariana Islands, jolted U.S. crypto policy by becoming the first public entity in the United States to receive approval to launch a USD-backed stablecoin. The move follows a successful vote by the Northern Mariana Islands House of Representatives to override a veto from the territory’s governor. The new legislation allows the Municipality of Tinian and Aguiguan to issue the “Tinian Stable Token,” formally named the Marianas US Dollar (MUSD). In a historic vote that will have a profound impact on the entire #crypto industry and my home, The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the House of Representatives voted to overturn a Governor's veto to allow the 1st US government-issued stablecoin to be issued here! pic.twitter.com/BOWjTyZXTV — Cyprian (Vin Armani) (@cyprianous) May 15, 2025 The stablecoin will be backed by cash and U.S. Treasury bills held in reserve by the Tinian Municipal Treasury, and launched on the eCash blockchain, a Bitcoin Cash ABC fork rebranded in 2021. The bill also authorizes Tinian to issue licenses to internet casinos, tying the digital asset launch to tourism and online gaming. With a population of just over 2,000, Tinian is seeking new revenue streams as its economy struggles. Tinian Overrides Governor’s Veto, Approves Marianas USD Stablecoin On May 9, the territory’s nine-member Senate voted 7-1 to override Governor Arnold Palacios’ veto . Days later, the 20-member House followed with a 14-2 vote, clearing the two-thirds majority needed to push the bill through. Tinian, a small island in the U.S. territory of the Northern Mariana Islands, is one step closer to launching its own stablecoin. #Stablecoin #Tinian https://t.co/U3xVI6Ax82 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 12, 2025 Governor Palacios vetoed the bill in April, citing legal concerns and a lack of enforcement measures to prevent illegal gambling. In a letter, he warned that the legislation may be unconstitutional and that its scope couldn’t be limited strictly to Tinian. Supporters of the bill argue the move could bring in much-needed revenue without burdening the government. “We need this legislation to unlock our potential,” said Republican Representative Patrick San Nicolas, a member of the Tinian delegation. “This bill does not depend on tourists or federal subsidies—it builds a digital industry generating revenue from a licensed jurisdiction.” The Tinian government has partnered with Marianas Rai Corporation as its exclusive technology provider for the stablecoin infrastructure. The firm’s co-founder, Vin Armani, urged lawmakers to reverse the veto ahead of the vote, claiming the bill could “attract billions of dollars of investment and tax revenue” to the island. Historic first: The Tinian government in the Northern Marina Islands will become the first-ever U.S. public entity to issue a USD-backed stablecoin — launching it on the eCash network! Chosen for its low fees, scalability, and gasless token design, eCash is powering… https://t.co/yUFULOiQlC pic.twitter.com/jSKV2WLoya — eCash (@eCashOfficial) May 16, 2025 However, not everyone agreed. Independent Representative Marissa Flores expressed concern over the bill’s connection to online gambling. “Every time we talk about casinos, there’s always some kind of bitter pill to swallow,” she said. “It is true, we are in dire need of money, but what I don’t like is when we are desperate… Every time we’re desperate, it always seems that we come back to casinos.” Despite the criticism, the bill passed and is expected to go into effect before July. Governor Palacios maintained his objections, warning that the measure could be unconstitutional and lack proper safeguards. Still, with both chambers of the legislature in favor, Tinian now leads the way as the first U.S. public entity to authorize and prepare to issue its own dollar-backed digital currency. Another State Advances Public Stablecoin Plans Amid Federal Regulatory Gridlock While Tinian leads with the first U.S. public stablecoin on the eCash Network, another state, Wyoming, is moving steadily with its own state-backed initiative. On May 12, the Wyoming Stable Token Commission announced a partnership with Inca Digital Federal LLC to strengthen oversight and security for the Wyoming Stable Token (WYST), expected to launch soon. Wyoming’s first state-issued stablecoin, WYST, will launch with live surveillance tech from Inca Digital. #wyoming #stablecoin https://t.co/UR6QTSzID0 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 14, 2025 WYST will be fully backed by cash, U.S. Treasuries, and repurchase agreements, and is designed to be redeemable 1:1 with the U.S. dollar. The commission is currently testing the token across Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche networks. Meanwhile, at the federal level, stablecoin regulation remains stalled. Legislative efforts like the GENIUS Act and the STABLE Act have lost momentum , largely due to political rifts over Donald Trump’s increasing involvement in crypto ventures.

Moody's announced that the US credit rating was downgraded to Aa1 due to rising budget deficits and rising interest costs. The organization noted that the US government's widening budget deficits are rapidly increasing the need for borrowing, which is putting upward pressure on interest rates in the long run. It also noted that current budget plans being discussed in Congress are not sufficient to reduce the persistent imbalance between spending and revenues. The move follows similar downgrades by Fitch Ratings in 2023 and S&P Global Ratings in 2011. The U.S. loses its highest credit rating from all three major rating agencies. Its new credit rating is Aa1, a level already shared with countries such as Austria and Finland. “Successive U.S. administrations and Congress have failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend of high annual budget deficits and rising interest costs,” Moody's said in a statement. Related News: Why Did the Judge Reject the Settlement in the Ripple-SEC Case? Three Legal Sources Respond The downgrade could add to the pressure on U.S. Treasuries already under pressure from expectations of higher inflation and rising debt, but experts do not expect the downgrade to cause significant market turbulence. Indeed, after the S&P downgrade in 2011, Treasury bonds rose due to the weak economic outlook. The US remains the world's largest economy and a benchmark against which other countries measure their economic reliability. Still, some investors say the latest downgrade could hurt the U.S.'s perception as a global haven of trust, leading global investors to demand higher yields on U.S. bonds. “This could increase the cost of servicing our debt, further widening the budget deficit,” said Michael Goosay, global head of fixed income at Principal Asset Management. *This is not investment advice.

Why Analysts Say 30x Appears Realistic,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/could-magacoinfinance-reach-1-in-2025-why-analysts-say-30x-appears-realistic/,"As the cryptocurrency market gains momentum in 2025, MAGACOINFINANCE is capturing significant attention. With over $8 million raised in its tokenand a current price under $0.001, analysts project a potential return of 18,500%, suggesting that a $1 valuation by year-end might be achievable. This projection is not only driven by strong fundamentals and market positioning but also by the accelerating pace of early stage investor participation , which often precedes the steepest phases of growth in high-performing altcoins. While established cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) continue to solidify their positions—ETH trading around $2,489 and SOL at approximately $172—MAGACOINFINANCE offers a compelling opportunity for exponential growth. Its unique blend of political meme appeal and structured tokenomics sets it apart in a crowded market. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Analyst Insights on MAGACOINFINANCE’s Potential Industry experts highlight several factors contributing to MAGACOINFINANCE’s bullish outlook: Scarcity-Driven Model: A capped supply of 100 billion tokens, with 45% allocated to the presale, creates a scarcity that can drive demand. Community Engagement: A rapidly growing community exceeding 20,000 holders indicates strong grassroots support. Audited Smart Contracts: As audited by HashEx , this ensures transparency and builds investor confidence. These elements, combined with a strategic marketing approach, have led analysts to forecast a conservative 35x return, with some models suggesting the potential for a 50x surge. Historical trends in cryptocurrency indicate that early-stage investments often yield the highest returns. With MAGACOINFINANCE still in its presale phase and a listing price target of $0.007, early investors have the opportunity to capitalize on significant upside potential before broader market adoption. LIMITED TIME OFFER-GET 50% EXTRA BONUS WITH MAGA50X Conclusion MAGACOINFINANCE stands out as a promising altcoin in 2025, offering a blend of strong fundamentals and high growth potential.

Launched five months ago, KEKIUS enjoys a strong community and significant liquidity. Elon Musk changed his X handle to Kekius Maximus again on Friday, May 17, 2025, thus indirectly promoting Ethereum (ETH)-based memecoin KEKIUS. At the tail end of 2024, Musk changed his X handle to Kekius Maximus and used an image of Pepe, a frog dressed in a gladiator costume. As a result, KEKIUS memecoin was born earlier this year on the Ethereum and Solana networks. During the first time that Musk changed his X handle to Kekius Maximus, KEKIUS price surged over 900 percent and surpassed a market cap of $380 million.

The small-cap memecoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $55 million and a 24-hour average traded volume of about $37 million, confirmed a bullish breakout potentially towards its all-time high. Moreover, the Ethereum-based memecoin has received significant attention from speculative crypto traders, currently amounting to over 26k on-chain holders. Additionally, the KEKIUS team has pooled over 452 WETH, currently worth about $1.16 million, to provide liquidity on different DeFi protocols. Most importantly, KEKIUS memecoin has already been listed by top-tier crypto exchanges led by Gate.io, and MEXC, among others. As a result, KEKIUS price is well positioned to rally exponentially in the coming months, especially amid the rising calls for an altseason.",Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-16 22:24:31

And so we think it makes it a lot easier to be exchanged, a lot more accessible for everybody.” Robinhood's Johann Kerbrat at Consensus 2025. Source: Cointelegraph Robinhood has been one of a handful of investment firms or brokerages that have explored RWA tokenization in recent months. Others include BlackRock , Franklin Templeton , Apollo , and VanEck . RWA tokenization is often touted as a means to enhance financial accessibility, with most tokenized funds currently concentrated on the private credit and US treasury markets. According to RWA.xyz on May 16, the total market capitalization of onchain RWA is $22.5 billion across just 101,457 asset holders. On average, each holder owns $221,867 in onchain assets. Related: MultiBank, MAG, Mavryk ink world’s largest $3B RWA tokenization deal Stablecoin evolution will create more ‘specialized’ tokens Kerbrat also touched on stablecoins, which have emerged as a key crypto use case this cycle. “You will see 100 stablecoins,” he predicted. Kerbrat expects a rise in stablecoins that are “more specialized in a specific market.” According to DefiLlama, dollar-pegged stablecoins dominate the stablecoin sector. The two largest, Tether’s USDt ( USDT ) and Circle’s USDC ( USDC ), account for $211.8 billion or 87.1% of the $243.3 billion stablecoin market cap. “If you're trying to move funds from the US to Singapore, maybe you will use a specific stablecoin,” he said. ""The shift is going to go from just stablecoin to platforms that are managing all these stablecoins.” Tether's USDT has seen its market share surge over the past few years.

The latest draft of the bill began circulating this week, and a copy seen by CoinDesk showed language had been adjusted in modest ways to help satisfy Democrats concerned with consumer protection and national security elements. In one addition, the bill insisted the big public companies such as Meta wouldn't be approved as issuers of the tokens, though consumer advocates cautioned that private companies such as Elon Musk's social media site X would be eligible. Hagerty paired his statement with one from Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, the New York Democrat who has also pushed this legislation. Her sentiment carried what may have been a shade less confidence about the outcome, and the two lawmakers have ample reason to put a strong public face on a negotiation that's faced headwinds. “Stablecoins are already playing an important role in the global economy, and it is essential that the U.S. enact legislation that protects consumers, while also enabling responsible innovations,” Gillibrand said in the statement, contending that ""robust consumer protections"" are included in the latest version. “The crafting of this bill has been a true bipartisan effort, and I’m optimistic we can pass it in the coming days.” The Senate has experienced considerable volatility on the bill in the past two weeks, with its recent failure to clear a so-called cloture vote that would have moved it forward into a formal debate. It's headed toward a second vote on Monday in which it needs 60 votes to advance, which would need to include several Democrats. The Senate would then have some time to continue debating the language and possibly make changes before moving on to actually passing the bill . Democrats had been critical of its potential for abuse and for stablecoin involvement from corporate giants, but the biggest stink has been raised around President Donald Trump's own interest in crypto businesses, including World Liberty Financial's stablecoin play. Read More: U.S. Senate's Stablecoin Push Still Alive as Bill May Return to Floor: Sources A previous version of the bill had easily advanced out of the Senate Banking Committee with a bipartisan vote before some of the same Democrats that approved it later raised objections. But the Senate has more crypto-friendly Democrats in this session than the last, when the Senate Banking Committee denied any progress for crypto bills. The House of Representatives is also working on its own version, which would have to be melded with the Senate's before Trump could sign the new standards into law. Representative French Hill, the Republican chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, acknowledged at Consensus 2025 in Toronto that Trump's crypto involvement has added friction to the lawmakers' negotiations.

While Dogecoin enjoys increasing popularity, another project is making waves with a unique blend of blockchain and AI technology. Ruvi AI presents not only an innovative approach to solving real-world challenges but also a promising investment opportunity. What is Ruvi AI? Ruvi AI combines artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain to create tools that help businesses improve operations, make better decisions, and manage data more efficiently. This seamless integration ensures transparency, trust, and security for users across different sectors such as healthcare, logistics, and finance. The project is already moving forward significantly with the release of its Beta platform. This live version gives users the opportunity to explore Ruvi AI’s features and see how the platform can deliver value. Its real-world focus sets it apart, as many blockchain projects remain purely theoretical. Presale success and future growth Ruvi AI’s presale results speak volumes about its popularity and potential. During Phase 1, tokens were offered at $0.01, and this phase sold out within just two weeks of launching. Investors who participated in this phase have already seen their token value rise by 50%, as the price has increased to $0.015 in Phase 2. Looking forward, market analysts predict Ruvi AI tokens could reach $1 shortly after listing on major exchanges. Such growth would represent a 6,500% return for early investors, a figure that has grabbed the attention of those familiar with the cryptocurrency and blockchain landscape. Rewarding investor commitment Ruvi AI goes a step further by introducing a VIP rewards system, which incentivizes participation through bonus tokens. These bonuses are tied to the number of tokens investors own, with different VIP tiers offering distinct levels of benefits. $750 investment (VIP tier 2) An investment of $750 during the presale at $0.015 per token buys 50,000 tokens. This qualifies the investor for VIP Tier 2, which provides a 40% bonus, amounting to an additional 20,000 tokens. The total holding increases to 70,000 tokens. At the token listing price of $0.07, these tokens are worth $4,900, delivering a 553% ROI. If Ruvi AI reaches its projected value of $1, the investment would grow to $70,000, representing a massive 9,233% ROI. $1,500 investment (VIP tier 3) For example, investing $1,500 at the presale price secures 100,000 tokens. This qualifies for VIP Tier 3, offering a 60% bonus and an additional 60,000 tokens, bringing the total to 160,000 tokens. When Ruvi AI lists at $0.07, the tokens would be valued at $11,200, delivering a 1,020% ROI for early investors. If Ruvi AI achieves a price of $1, the investment soars to $160,000, yielding a striking 10,567% ROI. $7,500 investment (VIP tier 5 eligibility) For larger investors, putting in $7,500 during the presale secures 500,000 tokens. With VIP Tier 5, investors earn a 100% bonus, doubling their holdings to 1,000,000 tokens. At a listing price of $0.07, these tokens will be worth $70,000, delivering an 833% ROI. If Ruvi AI reaches the projected valuation of $1, the investment balloons to $1,000,000, representing a 12,233% ROI. These examples emphasize how Ruvi AI balances accessibility with serious rewards for those willing to commit. Leaderboard rewards for contributors Ruvi AI’s leaderboard rewards system offers additional incentives for top investors, further encouraging participation and community engagement. The rewards are structured as follows: Top 10 contributors are awarded 500,000 tokens, worth $35,000 at $0.07 or $500,000 at $1. Top 50 contributors receive 250,000 tokens, valued at $17,500 at $0.07 or $250,000 at $1. Top 100 contributors earn 100,000 tokens, which are worth $7,000 at $0.07 or $100,000 at $1. This rewards structure ensures committed participants are well-compensated for their key role in helping the project grow. A vision for the future Ruvi AI aims to revolutionize industries with AI tools that are both functional and transparent. The Beta platform already showcases the project’s potential, proving its value to businesses worldwide. By addressing real-world problems, Ruvi AI stands out from other blockchain projects, which often struggle to deliver tangible results. Opportunity knocks with Ruvi AI With a current token price of $0.015 in Phase 2, Ruvi AI offers an incredible opportunity for early investors. Whether you start with a $750 investment to access VIP Tier 2 benefits or go for a $7,500 investment to unlock VIP Tier 5, the potential for outstanding growth is hard to ignore.

Chainlink helped shape SEC guidance, introducing “unified golden records” and compliance. SEC’s update permits transfer agents to use blockchain for secure, compliant recordkeeping. The SEC released new guidelines on May 15 that might encourage institutions to invest in digital assets. This change details the existing securities laws that apply to broker-dealers and transfer agents in the crypto sector. Such changes mirror a move to larger crypto adoption within the traditional financial industry, mainly for compliance and record management. SEC’s new FAQ discusses key questions on how current regulations treat cryptocurrencies. Hester Peirce said the guidance is just “incremental” and more thorough updates will be released later.

According to the analyst behind this forecast, XRP’s recent price behavior is not a sign of weakness but rather a period of strategic consolidation that is building momentum for the next major surge. Consolidation Phase To Fuel XRP Price Explosion Master Ananda, a crypto analyst on TradingView, released a detailed analysis of XRP on May 15. The analysis highlights the cryptocurrency’s current price action and predicts its next bullish move. Starting with its historical price behavior, the analysis highlights a strong rally that took place in 2024, particularly around November and December, when XRP printed long green candles that indicated strong momentum. Related Reading: Analyst Says XRP Must Hold This Level For Bullish Continuation To $4.2 After reaching a high, XRP entered a consolidation phase, during which price action formed a pattern resembling a symmetrical triangle or wedge. This is marked with red dashed lines on the chart, showing indecision in the market as the price was suppressed. Master Ananda revealed that after this triangle formation, XRP broke out around April 7, 2025 — a date now marked as a potential inflection point in the cryptocurrency’s market cycle. Since then, weekly candles have consistently closed in the green, indicating renewed bullish momentum. Adding to Master Ananda’s bullish case for the XRP price is a Fibonacci retracement and extension levels drawn from the previous major swing high to the recent low. These levels help identify potential resistance and target zones for the next leg up. Notably, the retracement levels have been marked around $2.05 (0.236 Fib), $2.39 (0.382 Fib), and $2.71 (0.618 Fib), culminating at the previous high of $3.40. Fibonacci extension project potential targets are at $4.50 (1.618 Fib), and the highest level is at $6.29 (2.618 Fib). Currently, the trajectory of the curved green arrow in the chart shows a more probable price target of around $5.9. However, XRP will still have to surge past the aforementioned retracement levels and the resistance at $4.5 to reach this level. The overall takeaway of this analysis is that XRP is printing strong bullish signals, and its current consolidation is seen as a precursor to further growth. The asset Approaches Make Or Break Zone XRP is entering a decisive phase, as crypto analyst Egrag Crypto predicts an imminent breakout from a tight consolidation range, within which the cryptocurrency has been trading for months. The analyst’s chart shows a purple zone, which he described as a “pandora box.” This zone represents a critical price range acting as both resistance and support, effectively trapping price action. Related Reading: XRP Price Surge To $10: Analyst Reveals Factors That Will Make It Happen In 2025 Egrag Crypto emphasizes that a breakout above or below this boxed range could ignite high volatility and significant momentum for XRP.

Bittensor (TAO), Render Token (RNDR), and NEAR Protocol (NEAR) are gaining attention for their technical innovations and rising market appeal. But a new name, BlockDAG, is quickly joining the conversation among the top crypto performers this year. With a low presale entry of just $0.0020, an official launch price of $0.05, and early momentum that includes over 20.5 billion tokens sold, BlockDAG is capturing serious investor interest. Unlike meme-fueled hype coins, BDAG offers real utility, a completed CertiK audit, and an EVM-compatible Layer 1 architecture ready for immediate adoption. In this article, we’ll explore why BlockDAG is earning its spot alongside TAO, RNDR, and NEAR, and why it could be one of the top crypto performers to watch right now. $250M+ Raised! BlockDAG Is The Hottest Crypto Buy Right Now BlockDAG is quickly positioning itself as one of the top crypto performers of 2025, and the numbers prove it. The project is currently in Batch 28, where the official price is set at $0.0262. But for a limited time, early adopters can still buy BDAG at just $0.0020, a price that delivers a projected 2,520% return based on its confirmed $0.05 launch value. To date, BlockDAG has sold over 20.5 billion coins, showing strong early demand. But this isn’t just a presale story. BlockDAG is built as an EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain, which means developers can instantly deploy Ethereum-based dApps on its network without extra code or adaptation. This future-ready design makes it practical and usable from day one. BlockDAG has already announced partnerships with five major exchanges, with another fifteen to be revealed on June 13, completing a 20-exchange rollout strategy before public trading begins. The project has also passed a CertiK audit, providing additional trust and transparency for buyers. Over 17,000 miners have been sold, adding to its ecosystem traction. With technical innovation, proven demand, and a presale price that won’t last much longer, BlockDAG is making a solid case as one of the top crypto performers of the year. Bittensor (TAO): AI Utility Meets Long-Term Vision Bittensor is trading at around $421.93 and has held firm despite short-term volatility. Analysts believe TAO could surge to $599.27 by mid-May and possibly reach as high as $2,119.06 this year. TAO’s edge lies in its AI-driven decentralized infrastructure, allowing data and models to be monetized directly on the blockchain. While TAO’s fundamentals are strong, its high price point may be a barrier for some investors. Still, with a projected average price of $1,283.54 in 2025, TAO remains one of the top crypto performers for those bullish on AI integration within blockchain networks. Render Token (RNDR): Decentralized Computing on the Rise Currently priced around $4.80, Render Token is building a decentralized GPU rendering network that’s gaining traction with creatives and developers. Despite recent price dips, projections show RNDR could reach $9.64 by year-end, offering a potential ROI of over 41%. As demand for GPU resources grows, especially for AI and 3D rendering tasks, RNDR’s value proposition becomes clearer. With consistent technical updates and ecosystem partnerships, Render is a solid candidate among 2025’s top crypto performers. NEAR Protocol (NEAR): Smart Contract Evolution and Fast Finality NEAR Protocol is trading at approximately $2.86 after a recent upgrade that introduced global contract support and 600ms block times. These enhancements support real-time AI and high-performance DeFi apps, positioning NEAR as a strong infrastructure choice. With price forecasts ranging from $3.70 in the short term to $20–$30 by year-end if ETF approvals go through, NEAR is gaining serious traction. Its robust roadmap and technical execution help secure its position among the top crypto performers of the year. Watch These Cryptos The 2025 crypto landscape is filled with strong contenders. Bittensor leverages AI infrastructure, Render serves the GPU-hungry creator economy, and NEAR is speeding toward smart contract dominance. All are worthy of recognition as top crypto performers. But BlockDAG stands out for its timing, utility, and explosive growth potential. With a $0.0020 entry, over 20.5 billion coins sold, and exchange listings set to scale, it offers something the others can’t: early access to what could become a dominant Layer 1 player. Its EVM compatibility, CertiK certification, and real hardware demand through miner sales add layers of credibility. As June 13 approaches and 15 more exchanges are revealed, momentum will only build. For those seeking a high-upside, early-stage opportunity among top crypto performers , BlockDAG may be the token everyone’s talking about next, and $0.0020 could soon be a distant memory.

While giants like Ethereum (ETH) , Avalanche (AVAX) , and Cardano (ADA) continue to hold strong, a growing number of investors are rotating into promising altcoins — and MAGACOINFINANCE is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about names in the space. Ethereum (ETH): Still Dominant but Facing Competition Ethereum remains the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, valued at around $291 billion . It maintains a strong lead over altcoins like XRP, AVAX, and Cardano, thanks to its DeFi, NFT, and Web3 ecosystem. But as ETH consolidates, traders are looking for higher-upside opportunities elsewhere — setting the stage for a shift into emerging tokens. Avalanche (AVAX): Holding Steady Amid Market Shifts AVAX has rebounded to the $19–$19.85 range, showing resilience as it eyes a potential breakout toward $23 . Despite its solid fundamentals, traders see altcoins like MAGACOINFINANCE as a chance to capture asymmetric gains — especially as AVAX’s growth trajectory slows. Cardano (ADA): Reliable but Seeking New Momentum Cardano is trading near $0.68 , with strong support at $0.66–$0.63 . While ADA remains a favorite among long-term holders, short-term traders are increasingly seeking altcoins with faster upside potential, adding fuel to the rotation into newer players. MAGACOINFINANCE: The Rising Star of the Altcoin Boom Enter MAGACOINFINANCE — a politically themed token that has captured market attention with over $8 million raised in presale and a price under $0.001 . With a $0.007 target listing price and a 25x–36x base ROI , MAGACOINFINANCE is on track to become one of the biggest breakout stories of the year. Early buyers can amplify gains using the MAGA50X bonus code , which delivers a 50% token bonus . Importantly, MAGACOINFINANCE isn’t just riding hype — it’s backed by strong tokenomics, an independent audit, and a viral community that’s rapidly expanding across crypto channels. Analysts are already comparing its setup to past cycle winners that delivered extraordinary returns, fueling even more bullish sentiment. Why Traders Are Flocking In As Ethereum, AVAX, and Cardano consolidate, MAGACOINFINANCE is offering traders something rare in today’s market — a high-conviction early-stage play with explosive upside potential . With three presale stages still open, the project remains one of the last big opportunities before mainstream momentum hits.

The result is a market narrative worth watching closely. Enter Qubetics ($TICS) and BNB, two distinct players shaping the future of blockchain—one through breakthrough infrastructure, the other through ecosystem dominance and liquidity scale. As community-led sentiment and protocol usage expand, focus is turning toward platforms offering real utility and measurable potential. While Qubetics emerges as a developer-centric project poised to redefine how decentralized applications are created and deployed, BNB continues reinforcing its position as a foundational asset with a current market cap of $91.57 billion and 140.89 million tokens in circulation. It’s not simply about momentum—it’s about architecture, execution, and staying power. At the same time, BNB’s entrenched value across DeFi, NFT platforms, and validator infrastructure keeps it relevant and in demand, especially as the BNB Price Prediction 2030 crosses into new territory. BNB: $91.57B Market Cap and $655.76 Price Reinforce Strength in Ecosystem Use With a live price of $655.76 and a circulating supply of 140.89 million tokens, BNB isn’t just holding its ground—it’s defining the standard for utility-focused digital assets. As the primary fuel of the BNB Chain, BNB facilitates millions of transactions daily, from powering smart contracts and executing low-fee payments to driving validator rewards and liquidity mining in decentralized finance. The $91.57 billion market cap positions BNB as a cornerstone in blockchain ecosystems. This isn’t built on temporary momentum. It’s rooted in strong fundamentals, including an aggressive coin burn model that has systematically reduced supply, elevating scarcity and demand. These built-in deflationary mechanics signal a long-term trajectory of growth aligned with expanding utility. Market Sentiments and Expert Analysis Technical indicators further support this sentiment. The 50-day and 200-day moving averages are trending upward, suggesting continued bullish momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains within neutral bounds, indicating no immediate signs of overbuying or weakening—just stable, data-backed progression. As the BNB Price Prediction 2030 climbs beyond $800, community participants are closely watching volume shifts and network upgrades. With BNB embedded across NFTs, cross-chain bridges, and DeFi protocols, its relevance in upcoming Web3 infrastructure remains indisputable. Qubetics ($TICS): 34th Stage, $0.2532 Token, and Practical Solutions for Developers Qubetics ($TICS) introduces more than a token—it brings a new coding standard through its QubeQode system, offering a visual, modular, and secure environment that eliminates the bulk of legacy issues in smart contract development. Designed to drastically reduce error rates and boost deployment speeds, QubeQode rewrites how smart contracts are built and tested. In particular, the Qubetics IDE is gaining traction for its streamlined UI and pre-coded libraries, making it easier to roll out contracts across DeFi, logistics, gaming, and asset tokenization—all with fewer failure points. Setting up a DeFi protocol in hours, not weeks. Imagine tokenizing agricultural output or manufacturing supply chains using ready-made modules and safe execution layers. Qubetics makes that possible—and it does it in a language developers understand natively. Its intuitive IDE and secure runtime simplify debugging and deployment, reducing common errors that typically slow down product releases. Currently in its 34th presale stage, Qubetics ($TICS) is priced at $0.2532. With over $17 million raised and more than 512 million tokens sold, community members are eyeing projections showing a potential 3,848% ROI at $10 post-mainnet. That kind of stat isn’t thrown around lightly—it signals belief in utility, execution, and scalability. Conclusion: Looking Toward 2030 with Strategic Confidence As blockchain enters its next chapter, it’s becoming increasingly clear that utility will outlast trend cycles. Qubetics ($TICS) is showing the kind of early-stage momentum that isn’t just exciting—it’s measurable. With over $17 million raised, and projections as high as 5,823% ROI at $15, early participation isn’t just about potential—it’s about aligning with innovation. Meanwhile, BNB continues to prove its durability through consistent price support, integration depth, and adoption metrics. The BNB Price Prediction 2030, climbing past the $800 line, is more than optimism—it’s rooted in active developer usage and technical stability. For community members evaluating their 2030 crypto portfolio, balancing established names like BNB with rising ecosystems like Qubetics ($TICS) provides not just diversification but strategic depth, and one of the top crypto presale . Stay tuned, stay prepared—and always build on data, not just dialogue.

44713457,https://timestabloid.com/?p=67424,1747438200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Best Meme Coins to Buy Today: Troller Cat Soars with Over 4k% ROI as XRP’s Potential 50% Crash Hurts Brett and Official Trump,https://timestabloid.com/best-meme-coins-to-buy-today-troller-cat-soars-with-over-4k/,"Have you ever imagined trolling your way to financial freedom just by playing games? With the rise of meme coins and Play-to-Earn platforms, that idea isn’t as far-fetched as it sounds. While XRP’s recent inverse cup-and-handle pattern sets off alarm bells, signals a potential 50% price crash, and tests the $2 neckline support, some meme coins are boldly swimming upstream. XRP’s NUPL entering the denial phase only confirms what seasoned traders already fear: we might be headed for a severe correction. But amid the red sea of pullbacks, coins like Brett and Official Trump show surprising strength. Brett is trying to rebound after hitting a three-month high, and Trump’s token surged 70% thanks to a VIP dinner event that brought meme hype back into the headlines. Yet, even with all this action, one cat is stealing the show—and not quietly. Enter Troller Cat , the internet’s new feline overlord, purring through presale milestones like it owns the place. Over the past few years, meme coins have gone from internet jokes to literal million-dollar moonshots. Dogecoin barked into mainstream headlines, and Shiba Inu pulled off one of the greatest underdog stories in crypto history. You can see fresh contenders like Brett, Trump, and Troller Cat trying to write the next chapter. But here’s the twist: Troller Cat isn’t just riding the meme wave—it’s building a whole Game Center empire during presale. With more than $125,000 raised in just 14 days and over 600 early joiners, it’s not just hype—it’s a serious movement. Troller Cat ($TCAT): Stage 5 Is Live With 4,453% ROI—Still Early Enough to Buy In The Troller Cat presale launched on May 2, 2025, with a starting price of just $0.00000500. Ten days later, Stage 5 is officially live, and $TCAT is now selling for $0.00001166—a 133.2% gain since day one. But the real action is still ahead. With a confirmed listing price of $0.0005309, investors getting in during Stage 5 are looking at a potential 4,453.17% ROI. That’s not a typo. If you buy TCAT now, you’re still incredibly early in one of the most talked-about meme launches of the month. Over $125,000 has been raised in 14 days, and more than 600 early buyers have jumped on board. This one checks every box for anyone scanning the market for the best meme coins to buy today. 26 Stages, Real Utility, and a Ton of Meme Power The Troller Cat presale is structured across 26 themed stages—each inspired by legendary internet trolls. Every stage pushes the price higher, rewarding early believers. Built on Ethereum, fully audited, and KYC-verified, $TCAT combines internet culture with serious tokenomics. Even better? You can stake your $TCAT during the presale and earn 69% APY. Staking begins immediately, with rewards unlocking two months after launch. That means you’re not just holding—you’re earning before the token even hits the open market. Referral Engine That Pays Troller Cat’s viral growth isn’t an accident. It’s baked in. Anyone who invests $25 or more gets a custom referral code. Share it, and both you and your invitee earn 10% bonus $TCAT. It’s a win-win; over 600 buyers have already used it to grow their stacks. For influencers, meme lords, and crypto degens, this isn’t just a fun coin—it’s a marketing machine. So if you’re asking yourself what the best meme coins to buy today are, this might be the most promising candidate. And with Stage 5 only just beginning, it’s not too late to buy TCAT before the price climbs again. Brett: Penguin Power or Just Hype in Disguise? Brett isn’t just some throwaway meme token—it’s a cultural statement born from the Based and Red-Pilled crowd. Brett has built serious traction with ties to the $BASE chain and a community that memes harder than your uncle on Facebook. The coin nearly doubled in price in under two months, breaking out past a stubborn $0.091 resistance level that had held since February. But here’s where things get real. After tagging that multi-month high, Brett took a 20% nosedive, currently hovering around $0.0728. Some call it a healthy pullback, while others fear it’s the beginning of a deeper correction. The $0.0585 support level is the big one to watch—if it bounces from there, Brett could skyrocket to $0.124 or even $0.159, setting up for a fresh leg in the bull cycle. Still, volatility is Brett’s middle name. This ain’t your grandma’s blue-chip—it’s a high-stakes meme ride that’s got traders in Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico glued to their charts. With the Brett army flooding Twitter and Telegram, there’s no shortage of hype. But the question remains: does Brett have a long-term roadmap, or is it just another meme coin surfing on sentiment? Official Trump: Meme Coin or Political Power Play? Unlike Trump, few names bring the internet to a halt, and his cryptocurrency is no exception. Official Trump went nuclear after dropping a game-changing promo: a VIP dinner with Donald Trump at his swanky National Golf Club. Only the top 25 wallets get a seat at the table—and that one move caused the coin to spike 70%, dragging it out of meme coin irrelevance. Now trading around $0.01 with a massive $2.58 billion market cap, Official Trump is turning heads again. But hold up—this coin once traded at a staggering $74 ATH. The current price is barely scratching the surface of its old glory. And while daily volume has exploded to $838 million, the big question is whether this surge sticks once the dinner plates are cleared after May 22. Trump’s vocal support for crypto—pro-Bitcoin, pro-ETF, even floating the idea of a U.S. crypto reserve—is helping keep the coin relevant. It’s political, edgy, and polarizing enough to stay in headlines. But there’s no real utility under the hood—no staking, no ecosystem, no use case beyond vibes and VIP tickets. So sure, TrumpCoin might be one of the best meme coins to buy today—if you’re looking for fast flips and political memes. But if you’re hunting long-term upside, APY rewards, and early-stage ROI up to 4453.17%, then $TCAT is the more brilliant troll to back. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, Troller Cat is more than another fluffy internet coin. While XRP flirts with a scary 50% crash and forms an inverse cup-and-handle pattern that could sink it to $1.24, meme coins are once again stealing the spotlight. Brett might bounce back if it holds key support. Official Trump may continue riding political momentum after May 22. But neither matches the explosive potential of the Troller Cat presale. With 4453.17% ROI on the horizon, $125K raised in two weeks, and 69% APY staking during presale, Troller Cat isn’t just trolling—it’s setting the stage for generational wealth. From its tiny entry point of $0.000005 in Stage 1 to its listing price of $0.0005309, this cat’s got nine lives and a moon mission. Don’t sit on the sidelines while others stack gains. The train’s leaving the station—either you’re on it or chasing it. Wanna see how far a cat can climb? Visit TrollerCat.com and find out. Just remember—early birds catch the catnip.

Troller Cat’s presale offers a low entry price, high ROI potential, and a 69% APY staking program, making it an attractive option for investors. How does Brett’s price movement affect its investment potential? Brett’s recent pullback presents a potential buying opportunity, with key support and resistance levels indicating possible price rebounds. What are the implications of Official Trump’s gala dinner for $TRUMP holders? The gala dinner has increased interest in $TRUMP, but it also raises concerns about political influence and investment ethics. Is Troller Cat’s staking program sustainable? Yes, the 69% APY is designed to reward long-term holders and is supported by the token’s deflationary mechanisms and community engagement strategies. How can I participate in Troller Cat’s presale? Interested investors can join the presale through Troller Cat’s official website, with a minimum purchase of $25 when using a referral code.

With strong fundamentals, technical strength, and surging community interest, these coins are fast becoming must-watch plays for traders and investors. XRP: Riding Legal Wins and Institutional Demand After Ripple’s own legal battle against the U.S. in a ruling victory, XRP has captured many headlines. SEC. XRP Trading Above $2.21 Sees Whale Accumulation. According to data from Santiment, XRP whale accumulation has reached extreme levels. Moreover, large whale holders now control over 12% of the cryptocurrency’s circulating supply. Analysts are looking at price targets of $3, $4.85, and perhaps $6.22. XRP’s future is looking good. Although it is a little volatile in the short term, it may likely reach Ethereum’s market cap if it runs at the current pace for a couple of weeks. Kaspa (KAS): Underrated Gem With BlockDAG Innovation Kaspa is gaining recognition as one of the top proof-of-work networks in the market. The KAS price forecast shows strong support around $0.55, and there is resistance near $0.083. Thus, the price is likely to push towards $0.11 later in the year. For Q3 and Q4 monthly prediction remains positive, the high volume of trading is consistent and also a growing developer ecosystem. Analysts keep an eye on Kaspa as a potential dark horse in the next bull cycle. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Solana (SOL): Technical Powerhouse on the Rise Solana is making a comeback, currently trading at $169.43, after easing from the April dip to $115. The technical indicators are suggesting that buyers are in control. It has an RSI of 73.70, MACD crossover is bullish, and the price action is above the 100-day and 200-day EMAs. Experts in the industry are aimed at a target price range of $180–$200 in the short term and can even rise to $350–$370 in the long term, should momentum and ecosystem growth continue. MAGACOINFINANCE: The Breakout Contender HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW While the majors hold attention, MAGACOINFINANCE is turning heads as one of the most explosive early-stage plays on the market. With over $8 million raised in presale, a price under $0.001 , and a $0.007 target listing price , MAGACOINFINANCE offers an eye-catching 25x–36x ROI potential . Early buyers using the MAGA50X bonus code receive an additional 50% token bonus , amplifying upside. Analysts point to MAGACOIN’s scarcity-driven model, independent audit, and surging community as signs it could become a breakout star in the next altcoin cycle. As the crypto market prepares for its next wave, XRP, Kaspa, Solana, and MAGACOINFINANCE stand out as key contenders to lead the charge. Together, they reflect the perfect mix of established strength and emerging opportunity — making them top picks for the next altcoin cycle.

Infrastructure-focused assets like KASPA , SUI , and XRP continue building on solid foundations—but capital is shifting. Meme coins, fueled by cultural sentiment and political virality, are driving exponential rallies. The meme cycle is no longer just noise—it’s attracting serious capital. While KASPA’s technical roadmap and DAG architecture keep it in high regard, and SUI continues its remarkable comeback, traders are increasingly rotating into tokens like MAGACOINFINANCE , drawn by its blend of political commentary and meme energy. THE CLOCK IS TICKING FAST – ACT NO W Technical Titans: KASPA, SUI, and XRP Hold Their Ground—for Now KASPA currently trades near $0.10 , with a market cap of roughly $2.7 billion . Backed by a unique blockDAG structure and a loyal developer community, KASPA has improved transaction speeds and scalability post-fork. Still, in this cycle, fundamentals alone aren’t always enough. SUI remains fundamentally strong, now valued over $8 billion , buoyed by consistent user growth and high-speed Layer-1 innovation. Price projections suggest a move toward $8.3–$9.0 by June—but volatility persists. XRP , one of the longest-standing giants, continues to average around $2.4–$2.5 with over $3.7 billion in daily volume. Though it enjoys deep liquidity and institutional interest, price growth remains tied to regulatory developments and macro adoption triggers. MAGACOINFINANCE: Quietly Rewriting the Meme Coin Playbook Amid meme favorites like DOGE , PEPE , and TRUMP , MAGACOINFINANCE is carving out a different path. It blends political branding with meme appeal—resulting in growing traction among retail traders and early-stage allocators seeking rotation trades. While it hasn’t reached billion-dollar daily volume yet, MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining ground through a focused pre-sale phase. Its narrative-driven approach resonates with those seeking more than speculative hype—this coin is building a community centered around culture and identity. Early Momentum and Accumulation Indicators Though still in development, MAGACOINFINANCE is generating key early signals: Community Growth : Social engagement is up significantly, with Discord and Beacon activity rising over the past two weeks Retail Inflow : Wallet analysis shows increasing accumulation from TRUMP and DOGE investors Narrative Alignment : Influencers within the meme sector have begun covering MAGACOINFINANCE’s positioning While its market cap lags behind SUI or XRP, early acquisition of MAGACOINFINANCE mimics the early movements seen in PEPE and TRUMP before their explosive growth. Can Fundamentals Compete With the Meme Trade in 2025? The truth is: fundamentals and memes are now clashing more directly than ever. KASPA offers true innovation and developer commitment. SUI has liquidity depth and speed. XRP remains a regulated, institutional bet. But meme coins are winning attention—and fast. MAGACOINFINANCE may not be the most technically robust token, but its cultural resonance and early-stage nature could turn it into the breakout of summer. With a limited token supply and a community-first approach, it plays into 2025’s rotating narrative economy where sentiment drives price as much as code. LIMITED TIME OFFER-GET 50% EXTRA BONUS WITH MAGA50X Conclusion: The Rotation Is Real—and MAGACOINFINANCE Is on the Radar As this market cycle matures, capital is flowing toward tokens with momentum, not just technology. KASPA, SUI, and XRP will remain relevant—but MAGACOINFINANCE represents the other side of the market: fast-moving, meme-aligned, and potentially explosive. With growing volume, rising attention, and a politically infused brand, this altcoin may be poised for a short-term surge—before its listing hits full throttle. To learn more about MAGACOINFINANCE , please visit Website: https://magacoinfinance.com Twitter/X: https://x.com/magacoinfinance FAQs What is MAGACOINFINANCE and how does it compare to major coins like SUI or XRP? MAGACOINFINANCE is a meme-driven token rooted in political culture. Unlike Layer-1 chains like SUI or settlement networks like XRP, it gains traction through narrative appeal rather than infrastructure use. Is XRP still affected by regulatory risk? Yes. While Ripple has gained clarity in some regions, global regulatory pressures remain a variable, and institutional demand is tied to long-term compliance.

The agency says that since April, malicious actors have sent text messages and artificial intelligence (AI)-generated voice messages that appear to be from senior US officials. The scheme targets individuals who are mostly current or former senior US federal or state government officials and their contacts. “If you receive a message claiming to be from a senior US official, do not assume it is authentic.” The perpetrators use techniques known as smishing and vishing to carry out spear phishing, a form of phishing attack where bad actors send personalized messages to specific individuals or groups. Smishing uses short message service (SMS) or multimedia message service (MMS) text messaging, while vishing uses phone calls or voice messages and may incorporate AI-generated voices. The FBI says that the fraudsters aim to establish rapport and gain access to personal accounts. They can do this by sending malicious links to their victims under the pretense of switching to a separate messaging platform. The agency says that contact information collected through social engineering schemes may be used to impersonate contacts to harvest information or obtain funds. “Access to personal or official accounts operated by US officials could be used to target other government officials, or their associates and contacts, by using trusted contact information they obtain.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Gold, Analyst Sees ‘Higher Than Expected’ Returns",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-strengthens-vs-gold-analyst-sees-higher-than-expected-returns/,"Bitcoin’s price may surge above $200,000 next year, according to recent analysis by X account Apsk32. He warns that the familiar four‑year cycle for BTC often lines up with fresh highs. Short swings have hit traders hard before. This time, bulls say Bitcoin could even top $250,000 in 2025. Related Reading: XRP Frenzy Builds: Over $1 Billion in Open Interest Signals Breakout Tension Bitcoin Gold Link According to Apsk32, Bitcoin often trails gold by a few months. Gold hit a record $3,500 per ounce earlier this year. If Bitcoin follows that path, it could surge. He measures Bitcoin’s market value in ounces of gold instead of dollars. That way, money printing and inflation don’t skew the view. Power Curve Model Apsk32 uses what he calls a “power curve” tool. It fits Bitcoin’s market cap in gold ounces to a smooth curve. The tool stretches back to the 2017 high near $20,000. When plotted, it suggests a 2025 bull‑market peak above $200,000. He told X followers that “if Bitcoin’s position relative to gold keeps improving, returns could top expectations.” Bitcoin’s position relative to gold has improved considerably since April. This is the indicator that gives me hope for higher than expected returns later this year. BTC-USD is close to extreme greed, which sounds scary, but it’s also where we would expect to be if Bitcoin… pic.twitter.com/CY1Qxy4Hdi — apsk32 (@apsk32) May 16, 2025 Realistic Price Targets While some models push for $444,000 this year—what Apsk32 credits to “five years ahead of support”—he thinks a more realistic goal is $220,000. He added there’s a “decent chance” BTC hits $250,000, but he doesn’t see that as the most likely outcome. The $220,000 level would still mark a 10× jump from Bitcoin’s low near $22,000 in late 2022. Gold Market Scenarios Other market experts ran a different test. They looked at how much Bitcoin could be worth if it claimed part of gold’s total value. If gold reaches, say, $5,000 per ounce by 2030 and Bitcoin grabs half of gold’s market cap, BTC could hit a price of more than $920k. But then, these figures are scenario‑based, not firm predictions. Supply And Demand Factors Bitcoin’s supply is capped at 21 million coins. Every block halving makes new BTC rarer. These events come roughly every four years. The next one is expected in 2024. After that, miner rewards fall from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block. Scarcity has driven prices up in past cycles. But demand could shift if big investors pull back. Related Reading: Analysis: Crypto Heats Up As $35 Billion Enters Market In Under A Month Risks And Opportunities Volatility in both gold and Bitcoin could upend these models. Gold can face sudden drops when traders take profits. Bitcoin has swung 20% or more in a single day before. Regulatory moves, geo‑political events, and tech upgrades all play a part. Still, setting clear price scenarios helps investors plan.

This issue temporarily allowed a limited number of customer accounts to be viewable by another customer during online banking… Our team quickly detected and resolved the matter, temporarily disabling some online functions until everything was fixed.

Arvest Bank is offering credit monitoring and identity theft recovery services to affected customers. The bank also says customers who are very concerned about becoming a victim of fraud or identity theft can place a security freeze on their credit files at no cost by contacting any of the three major nationwide credit reporting companies – Equifax, Experian or TransUnion.

According to the May 16 report, the measures include priority access to police emergency lines, home security assessments, and safety briefings from French law enforcement to ensure best practices are being followed. France’s Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau introduced the security measures as part of a broader effort to counter the recent wave of attacks. ""These repeated kidnappings of professionals in the crypto sector will be fought with specific tools, both immediate and short-term, to prevent, dissuade and hinder in order to protect the industry.” Law enforcement officers will also undergo ""anti-crypto asset laundering training,” Retailleau noted. Retailleau met with several local leaders from the crypto industry to discuss the measures following three crypto-related kidnapping incidents in recent months. Two kidnappings and a failed attempt in France this year The latest incident occurred on May 13, when assailants attempted to abduct the daughter and grandson of Pierre Noizat, CEO of the French crypto platform Paymium. Fortunately, they managed to fend off the attack, which occurred in broad daylight. The assailants tried to force the pair into a waiting van, but Noizat’s daughter managed to take one of the guns off an assailant and throw it away, local police said.

He was held captive until a police operation on the night of Jan. 22 secured his release. Retailleau said earlier this week that he believes the incidents were likely connected. There have been over 150 crypto-related robbery or kidnapping incidents since 2014, with 23 of those incidents occurring in 2025 alone, according to a GitHub database maintained by Bitcoin cypherpunk Jameson Lopp. Lopp noted many of these criminals typically identify future victims through social media posts, public conversations, meetups, and conferences. He strongly advises against peer-to-peer trades — particularly with people you don’t trust — flaunting wealth on social media and wearing crypto-branded clothing.

With analysts forecasting potential 25x gains , the momentum shift toward MAGACOINFINANCE is drawing serious attention across trading circles. XRP and Shiba Inu: Profits Recycled Into Fresh Opportunities XRP has been one of 2025’s most resilient performers, bolstered by key legal victories and institutional inflows. Trading above $2.21 , XRP whales have accumulated over 12% of the supply, signaling bullish conviction. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu has seen a revival, climbing 7% in April and benefiting from major token burns and ecosystem upgrades like Shibarium. However, as both XRP and SHIB approach key resistance levels, traders are increasingly looking for new altcoins with asymmetric upside — and MAGACOINFINANCE has emerged as a top destination. MAGACOINFINANCE: A High-Upside Alternative MAGACOINFINANCE has quickly positioned itself as one of the most promising early-stage plays of the year. With over $8 million raised in presale, a price still under $0.001 , and a target listing price of $0.007 , MAGACOIN offers an extraordinary 25x–36x ROI potential . What’s fueling the FOMO? Beyond the price potential, MAGACOINFINANCE has: A scarcity-driven release model that creates continuous demand pressure An independent audit (by HASHEX) that adds credibility and investor trust A viral, politically themed narrative that is dominating crypto conversations Early buyers can also tap into the MAGA50X bonus code , which provides a 50% token bonus — a rare opportunity in today’s crowded altcoin market. Why Traders Are Making the Jump Now For many XRP and Shiba Inu holders, the appeal of MAGACOINFINANCE lies in its early-stage positioning. While blue-chip altcoins are seen as steady holds, MAGACOIN represents a chance to catch the kind of exponential upside typically seen in the earliest phases of past bull markets. Importantly, this isn’t just hype — MAGACOIN’s momentum is backed by strategic execution, community growth, and disciplined tokenomics. Analysts note that coins launched with similar models have historically delivered up to 18,500% gains , adding even more weight to bullish projections. As profits rotate out of mature assets like XRP and SHIB, MAGACOINFINANCE is capturing trader enthusiasm ahead of a potential breakout. For those seeking one of the highest-upside bets in today’s market, the window to act is now — before the next wave hits.

On-chain data suggests the current profit taking is too weak to extinguish Bitcoin’s current price momentum. Bitcoin ( BTC ) price has spent the bulk of the week pinned below $104,000 to $105,000, which many analysts have labelled as a resistance zone, but an alternative view suggests that BTC is simply consolidating within a bull flag. A bull flag is a continuation pattern that is characterized by a period of sideways price action following a sharp uptrend, and when the structure confirms or breaks from the trendline resistance, the uptrend continues. BTC/USDT 1-day chart. Source: TRDR.io While the range-bound trading portion of the flag is said to represent indecision from buyers and sellers, in this scenario, the absence of buy volume is the primary culprit. As shown in the TRDR.io chart below, Bitcoin’s explosive move to $105,900 from $74,400 was accompanied by large liquidations in the margin markets and robust spot volumes, which aligned with several days of billion-dollar spot BTC ETF inflows. BTC/USDT 1hr chart. Source: TRDR.io During this three-week period, several US-based and international companies also announced plans to purchase Bitcoin and establish BTC treasuries . The spot and futures cumulative volume delta, along with the open interest metric on the chart show traders selling near the range highs and the absence of new long leverage and significantly sized spot positions being opened in this area, whereas drops to range low (bull flag support) sees bids filled on the spot side, but there is still limited use of margin for fresh longs. BTC/USD spot and margin CVD. Source: TRDR.io Bitcoin’s recent cool-down phase is a normal outcome after the near 40% recovery that started on April 8, and the loss of upward momentum resulting from profit-taking in futures markets near the current range high is also to be expected. Bitcoin short-term holder supply profit and loss data from Glassnode supports this view, as shown in the chart below. The onchain data company highlighted profit taking for short-term traders but explained that it does not exceed the statistical norm, leaving room for further price upside. “Recently, the magnitude of STH Realized Profit has surged to almost +3 standard deviations above its 90-day average, reflecting a notable uptick in profit realization. In past cycles, particularly during rallies towards the ATH, this metric has historically climbed to over +5 standard deviations of more. This signals that much stronger profit-taking pressure is often required to overwhelm the inflow demand.” BTC: Short-term holder activity in profit and loss.

Bitcoin should test underlying support before moving higher With the bulk of Bitcoin’s apparent sell-side liquidity absorbed during the move to $105,000, some analysts warn that a brief flush down to test $100,000 to $90,000 as support could be the next move for BTC price.

The analyst said that “$90K remains my long-term line in the sand for spot exposure,” adding that he is “cautiously bullish” with price above $90,000 but that is dependent upon how US equity markets perform in the short term. “I would not be surprised to see a short-term flush if stocks were to roll over and make a higher low somewhere. Considering most stocks moved 30% to 50% in a single month, this wouldn’t be that crazy either.” This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Despite a 7% dip over 24 hours, SHIB is still up 25% for the month with a price of $0.0000149 . Analysts predict Shiba Inu could go up 121% to $0.000033 if the stars align. While those numbers are nice, a new project Ruvi is emerging as a serious contender. With its use of blockchain and AI , Ruvi is the project you can’t ignore. Riding on Shiba Inu’s Coattails Shiba Inu has been the trendsetter in capturing investor interest, especially during market rebounds. Over the past month it has shown strength and potential. Whale activity and speculation has built momentum and analysts are charting a bullish path. But while Shiba Inu largely thrives on meme culture and community support , Ruvi is the innovative force blending blockchain and real-world AI applications . Ruvi is more than just speculative value, it’s designed to solve real world problems. Here’s why Ruvi’s trajectory could outshine traditional meme coins like Shiba Inu. Why Ruvi Is the One to Watch Ruvi is going to leave a mark on the crypto landscape by embedding AI into blockchain. This alignment allows Ruvi to tackle global challenges across healthcare, logistics and finance . Ruvi’s Features: AI Driven Insights Ruvi’s AI brings predictive analytics and automation to blockchain for enterprise and consumer use cases. Deflationary Tokenomics Unlike meme tokens with infinite supply, Ruvi has a total of 5 billion tokens , creating scarcity that drives long term value. Cross Industry Utility Ruvi’s infrastructure is designed to be versatile and support multiple industries for real world adoption. While meme coins like Shiba Inu ride the hype wave, Ruvi is built for sustainable growth through technology. Ruvi’s Presale Ruvi has already shown its potential by completing phase 1 of the presale, raising over $1 million and selling 100 million tokens. With over 1,000 investors on board, Ruvi has now entered phase 2 with tokens priced at $0.015. For smart investors this is a golden opportunity to get in early before Ruvi’s value skyrockets. Ruvi Investment Scenarios Ruvi’s presale bonuses make it impossible to resist for early adopters. Here’s how different investment levels look: Example 1: Entry-Level Investment ($600) Tokens Purchased: $600 / $0.015 = 40,000 tokens Bonus (20%): +8,000 tokens Total Tokens: 48,000 Value at $1: $48,000 Example 2: Mid-Level Investment ($2,000) Tokens Purchased: $2,000 / $0.015 = 133,333 tokens Bonus (60%): +80,000 tokens Total Tokens: 213,333 Value at $2: $426,666 Example 3: High-Level Investment ($12,000) Tokens Purchased: $12,000 / $0.015 = 800,000 tokens Bonus (100%): +800,000 tokens Total Tokens: 1.6 million Value at $3: $4.8 million These examples show why Ruvi’s presale is the most profitable opportunity in crypto right now. Ruvi vs Shiba Inu While Shiba Inu is a cool meme coin with community driven momentum, Ruvi is carving its own niche by focusing on utility and innovation. Ruvi’s AI and real-world applications give it an edge. Shiba Inu rides the speculative wave, Ruvi delivers tangible and scalable solutions for industries worldwide and ensures its longevity and impact. Don’t Miss Out Cryptocurrency markets are defined by their early winners and Ruvi is going to be one of them.

Why 2025 Could Be Its Big Rebound Year For ADA and This DeFi Token,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/is-cardano-price-about-to-explode-why-2025-could-be-its-big-rebound-year-for-ada-and-this-defi-token/,"The price of Cardano (ADA) is soaring, and has grown 57% from April lows to $0.8092, arousing emotions in the crypto market. Technical charts provide bullish signals with the implication of 63% jump to $1.3265. Meanwhile there is Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is the rising DeFi star, when it comes to phase 4 presale, it is attracting the crowds, as $8,500,000 has been raised and over 470 million tokens sold to 9,900 holders. With a strengthening of Cardano’s decentralized roots, and with investor ardor being stoked by Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , 2025 stands in the wings for a breakthrough. Both the projects, dynamic and different, are set to reinvent the crypto narrative with daring steps and tall yields. Cardano’s Resilient Climb Cardano (ADA) is showing its muscles as it trades at its maximum since the month of march. The blockchain, a strong competitor of Ethereum and Solana, claims to have increased speed of transactions and strong decentralization. Its recent addition into the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund will show growing institutional trust thereby ranking it in the top list of crypto assets. Yet, challenges linger. Cardano lacks behind competitors with only 42 DeFi apps and $470 million in the total value locked. The next consensus event in Toronto with the founder Charles Hoskinson in tow may end up changing the gears. As a result of his interest in Bitcoin integration through BitcoinOS, staking possibilities may be opened up, and Cardano’s popularity will be increased. Technical patterns such as the inverse head and shoulders indicate the possible rise to $1.79 in the year 2025 but dropping below important trendlines may affect this momentum. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Frenzy Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is stirring the investor desire in its state 4 presale, with 75% filled-up at $0.025 per token. Though beginning from the $0.01 in the opening phase, with the price increase, the price is slowly moving up, and the phase 5 lurks with the 20% jump to $0.03 providing immediate profit for existing buyers. The tokenomics of the project promise a 140% return at the $0.06 list price and analysts’ speculation of a rise of $2.50 post-launch would bring 9900% ROI. Recently, the team put forward a dashboard on which the top 50 holders are demonstrated with bonus tokens given to them for holding their positions against what one may assume to be fierce competition. Security and Transparency Drive Trust Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is focusing on the safety aspect as it works for the smart contract audit with the help of Certik. Social networks will post results within no time hence strengthening the belief in credibility of the platform. Although the sector of DeFi in Cardano is expanding sluggishly, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently useful on account of being an overcollateralized lending platform. The investors can be interested in mtTokens which can grow in a value during the time-passing becoming liquidity and stability. The buy-and-distribute system puts proceeds of the platform towards acquisition of tokens and compensating the stakers and providing for the demands. As phase 4 is about to be over, the calls become loud on the part of the investors to acquire the tokens before the prices rise upward hence the opportune time to embrace the early adopters. A Defining Year Ahead Cardano (ADA) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are on courses for the conquest of the market in 2025. Technical breakout on Cardano and the institutional support show that it is a steady rise with potential prospections of accumulating to $1.79. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) which has experienced a rage in its presale which has sprouted the roofs, and comes with the innovative concept of DeFi is explosive in returns and especially for those who will buy in phase 4. Both of the projects give a picture of the dynamic power of crypto-market which is at the same time a spirit of resilience and an opportunity. Those investors that are searching for the best crypto to buy now have to consider the Mutuum Finance, (MUTM) presale and pay attention to the further moves of Cardano. Move fast, the low-point of entry to phase 4 is not going to last.

33767162,[object Object],1747443608,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Dogecoin ETF Race Heats Up As SEC Acknowledges 21Shares Filing,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-etf-race-heats-up/,"The prospect of a Dogecoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) finally making its way into the US financial markets has taken a major step forward and now feels more realistic than ever. This fresh optimism stems from a significant regulatory update: the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially acknowledged the 21Shares filing for a Dogecoin ETF, marking the beginning of a formal review process. SEC Acknowledges NASDAQ’s Filing To List And Trade Shares of 21Shares’ Dogecoin ETF The SEC’s acknowledgment of 21Shares’ DOGE ETF filing signals the start of an official review process. On May 13, 2025, the Commission published a notice confirming that Nasdaq’s request to list the 21Shares Dogecoin ETF had been received, effectively putting the proposal on the public docket. However, it is important to note that this step does not equate to an approval. Instead, it initiates a period of scrutiny and public comment that can extend up to 240 days before a final decision is due. In fact, the SEC’s ultimate deadline for the 21Shares Dogecoin ETF would be January 9, 2026, if all extensions are utilized. But for now, the acknowledgment locks in a timeline and affirms that the agency is actively considering the DOGE fund idea. 21Shares, a Switzerland-based asset manager, filed its initial registration for a spot Dogecoin ETF on April 9. The firm partnered with the Dogecoin Foundation’s corporate arm, known as House of Doge, to help promote the fund. According to the filing, the proposed ETF is designed as a passive trust holding actual DOGE tokens, tracking a benchmark index of the meme coin’s price without using leverage or derivatives. Furthermore, Coinbase Custody Trust was brought on as the custodian for the fund’s DOGE holdings, probably to target institutional and retail brokerage channels. DOGE ETF Race Heats Up. Now Closer Than Ever The review of the Dogecoin ETF comes at a time when the SEC’s stance on crypto products is shifting. Under the new leadership of SEC Chair Paul Atkins, the agency has shown signs of a more open approach toward cryptocurrency investments. The current administration in Washington has been described as more crypto-friendly than its predecessor, and the SEC has recently taken steps like dismissing cases against crypto companies and engaging in crypto-focused discussions with industry stakeholders. This backdrop of a softer regulatory outlook gives the DOGE ETF bid a fighting chance that might not have existed just a couple of years ago. In addition to 21Shares, several other asset management firms have filed applications to launch Dogecoin ETFs in the United States. Bitwise Asset Management submitted its application for a spot Dogecoin ETF on January 28, 2025, with NYSE Arca proposing to list the fund.

Meanwhile, Tether (USDT) is making waves by integrating with LINE NEXT and Kaia blockchain, bringing stablecoins to Asia’s Web3 scene through LINE Messenger. But if you want to see real action, BlockDAG is on another level. Its Buyer Battles are driving 150 million BDAG transactions daily, with big buyers racing to grab unsold coins. Having already raised $251 million and sold 20.5 billion coins, BlockDAG is seeing daily growth that other projects are only promising. With over 170,000 holders, it’s clear that demand isn’t just growing—it’s thriving. SUI Gathers Speed, Eyes $4.20 Breakout SUI’s bullish momentum is picking up speed, now targeting a breakout above $4.20. With $11.7 million in weekly inflows, it’s outpacing Solana and Ethereum, making SUI the top altcoin investment of the year with $84 million in total. On-chain indicators are looking solid too, with RSI nearing 72 and a bullish MACD crossover signaling strong momentum. The price is climbing back through key Fibonacci levels, adding fuel to the fire. To top it off, SUI’s big event in Vietnam on May 17 will spotlight its DeFi, AI, and gaming potential, further boosting investor confidence. Tether Expands in Asia via LINE NEXT Tether is making strategic moves with USDT now integrated into the Kaia blockchain, extending its reach across Asia via LINE NEXT’s Web3 platform. This update allows LINE Messenger users to easily send, receive, and earn USDT directly through Mini Dapps and in-app wallets. By powering Kaia’s DeFi and payment services, Tether is pushing deeper into mainstream usage in the region. This partnership focuses on boosting financial inclusion and simplifying cross-border payments, solidifying Tether’s role in accessible stablecoins. With LINE’s vast user base, USDT adoption in Asia could soar, positioning Tether at the forefront of the region’s Web3 growth. Buyer Battles Drive BlockDAG Presale to $251M! When diving into crypto presales, it can be tough to distinguish real value from all the hype. But with BlockDAG, the chaos is transformed into something clear and exciting. Thanks to its innovative Buyer Battles, every day’s activity is right in front of you. The daily allocation has been bumped up to 150 million BDAG, creating noticeable action in the market. Here’s how it works: each day starts with a set amount of coins up for grabs. If the daily target isn’t hit, the unsold coins go straight to the top buyer of the day. Simple, right? But the results speak volumes. This system keeps buyers coming back, maintaining a steady flow of interest and fueling high demand throughout the presale. And this isn’t just noise. BlockDAG is already showing liquidity levels that most projects only dream of post-launch. With over $251 million raised and 170,000 holders, the presale has been nothing short of a success. In just 28 batches, the price has surged 2520%, jumping from $0.001 to $0.0262. But here’s the kicker: the price will remain at $0.0020 until June 13th before taking off to $0.05 when it officially launches. Experts are bullish, with predictions placing BDAG at $1 short-term and possibly even higher in the long run. But what’s really impressive is how well BlockDAG is performing right now. The presale is still open, but once it’s over, the market will have its say. Don’t wait too long, or you might miss the boat to the best crypto of 2025 ! Which Is the Best Crypto to Buy Today? SUI’s momentum is unstoppable, pulling in $84 million in inflows this year and $11.7 million just this week, leaving Solana and Ethereum in the dust. Meanwhile, Tether (USDT) is expanding its reach, integrating with LINE NEXT and Kaia blockchain, bringing stablecoins directly into Asia’s mobile payments via LINE Messenger. But if you’re looking for real action, BlockDAG is where it’s happening. With $251 million raised and 20.5 billion coins sold, its Buyer Battles are turning the presale into a high-stakes race. Prices have already skyrocketed 2,520% since Batch 1, and with demand still rising, this might be your final chance to jump in before prices go even higher.

Although the leading memecoin has posted impressive gains recently, analysts believe there may still be room for DOGE to climb before reaching a cycle top. Analyst Identifies Signal That May Predict Dogecoin Top According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor burakkemeci, DOGE price tops often align with a surge in retail futures trading activity. The analyst shared the following chart illustrating the relationship between DOGE price peaks and periods of heightened high-frequency futures trading by retail investors. The above chart features red bubbles that mark periods of excessive retail trading activity in the DOGE futures market. These bubbles consistently appear near major price peaks, suggesting the market may be overheating during those phases. Related Reading: Dogecoin Hits Critical Zone—Here’s What 3 Leading Analysts Are Watching In contrast, green and pink bubbles on the chart represent periods with lower retail participation. These phases typically coincide with more stable or “healthier” market conditions, which could offer better entry points for new investors. The analyst emphasized that monitoring these red bubbles may help both traders and investors anticipate potential short-term tops in DOGE. Spikes in retail participation often reflect heightened market greed – frequently a precursor to sharp price corrections. At present, Dogecoin futures activity appears to be in a neutral zone, indicating that the asset may still have room to grow before nearing an overheated state. This view is echoed by crypto analyst Anup Dhungana. In a recent post on X, Dhungana shared the following weekly DOGE chart showing a breakout from a long-term falling wedge pattern – a bullish technical setup that often precedes price rallies. Based on this breakout, the analyst forecasts that DOGE could reach $1 in the current market cycle. All Eyes On $1 DOGE The $1 price target has long been a symbolic milestone for Dogecoin enthusiasts. During the 2021 bull run, DOGE reached an all-time high (ATH) of $0.73 but ultimately fell short of the coveted $1 mark. Related Reading: Dogecoin Pullback May Be Short-Lived—Here’s The Next Price Target This time, however, several analysts believe that Dogecoin could finally hit the $1 milestone. Noted crypto analyst Kevin recently pointed to $1.10–$1.25 as a plausible target, based on Fibonacci retracement levels. However, seasoned market watcher Ali Martinez cautioned that DOGE must first overcome a significant resistance level at $0.36 to sustain its bullish momentum. At press time, DOGE trades at $0.22, up 1% in the past 24 hours.

Near Protocol has made progress with its first native vesting contract. This helps improve security and trust for AI and DeFi projects. At the same time, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen a big fall in trading volume and a 95% drop in its token burn rate. This raises questions about its current market strength. On the other hand, Unstaked is quietly attracting attention. It offers an AI platform aimed at clear utility. Unstaked has raised $6 million across 12 stages of its ongoing presale, with tokens priced at $0.008997. The planned launch price is $0.1819. Its projected 2,700% ROI is drawing early interest. More success and surprising numbers are still on the way. NEAR’s New Era: Vesting Contract Brings Stronger Security Rhea Finance and Intellex have launched the first vesting contract built for Near Protocol. This move gives projects on NEAR a safe way to manage token releases. Before this, NEAR did not have its own vesting system. This contract now offers a method to release tokens over time, lowering the risk of early sell-offs. It also meets audit rules to help projects meet standards. The contract works directly within the NEAR ecosystem and supports token projects, including AI and DeFi. It marks a step forward for NEAR in building tools for secure growth. This improvement could help attract more users and projects to the network. Shiba Inu’s Burn Rate Drops as Trading Activity Slows Shiba Inu’s burn rate has dropped sharply. Only 964,247 SHIB tokens were burned in the last day, a fall of 95%. Trading volume has also decreased, showing lower interest from traders. Token burns normally help reduce supply and support the price over time. The recent slowdown has raised doubts about SHIB’s short-term momentum. Despite this, SHIB’s price has remained mostly steady. This suggests holders are not selling in large amounts. Some believe this could be a quiet phase before a new move. A rise in burn rate or trading could hint at the next price trend. Unstaked Presale Nears Next Price Increase in Coming Days Unstaked aims to offer more than just another presale. It focuses on building AI tools that work across Telegram and X. These planned AI agents are designed to help grow online groups, manage conversations, and handle tasks without constant human effort. They are expected to begin working once the token launches. A key feature is the Proof of Intelligence system. It will track every action of these AI agents and record it on-chain. This makes all results clear and directly connects activity to the value of the Unstaked token. Users will be part of a system built on real use, not promises. The presale is now in stage 12 for $0.008997 per $UNSD. Each stage raises the price, with the launch price set near $0.1819. The projected return is around 2,700%. More than $6 million has already been raised. The next price change is expected soon, offering a limited chance for early access and planned utility. The Bottom Line Near Protocol has made progress in improving token security, a key move for long-term growth. Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen a drop in trading activity. Many holders remain cautious as momentum slows. Unstaked, however, is moving forward. Its AI agents are expected to begin work once the platform launches. The Proof of Intelligence system is designed to provide clear tracking and rewards based on results. With the crypto presale over $6 million raised and a current price of $0.008997 in stage 12, Unstaked focuses on creating a working system. The projected return of 2,700% and the next price increase make this an option to watch for long-term plans.

In threads across r/CryptoMoonShots , r/altcoin , and r/CryptoCurrency , users are debating why this new project could be the next 100x gainer — and the reasons are stacking up fast. MAGACOINFINANCE combines aggressive meme branding with a growing online presence, but what’s catching Reddit’s attention is its clear early traction , rapid investor growth , and low-entry price structure . Several threads have called it “ a rare setup for exponential returns ” — and traders are now racing to secure a position early. Why MAGACOINFINANCE Is Becoming the #1 Choice in 2025 Investors are shifting away from overbought majors like Ethereum and Cardano and turning their focus to high-potential altcoins/memecoins with viral potential . MAGACOINFINANCE is positioning itself as a strategic early-stage entry — with everything Reddit traders love: Bold branding Fast-growing community Clear listing goals Strong online traction without mainstream hype (yet) Redditors are already comparing MAGACOINFINANCE to early SHIBA INU , citing similar energy, user engagement, and a wave of organic support. Some even speculate that once this coin hits centralized exchanges, it could be one of the fastest-rising meme coins of the year . Reddit’s Verdict: The 100x Potential Is Still on the Table What sets MAGACOINFINANCE apart, according to Reddit discussions, is the calculated setup , a low initial price, token scarcity, and a rapidly expanding audience. Posts breaking down ROI scenarios have shown that even modest investments today could turn into life-changing returns if MAGACOINFINANCE delivers on its early promise. And with Reddit acting as a leading indicator for early crypto narratives, this kind of grassroots energy could be the spark that ignites a full-blown rally.

SEC: Deaton says SEC must admit faults for new XRP judgment,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/sec-must-admit-faults-for-new-ripple-case/,"After Judge Torres denied the Ripple SEC motion for an indicative ruling, legal experts have shared various perspectives on the next steps in the prolonged legal battle. Pro-crypto attorney and former senatorial candidate John Deaton also weighed in on the ruling, outlining what both parties need to do before Judge Torres can consider amending her judgment in the XRP lawsuit . SEC should acknowledge errors and work with Ripple for new judgment During a live broadcast, John Deaton explained that for a new judgment to be issued in the XRP lawsuit, the SEC must acknowledge its errors and withdraw its previous arguments. He emphasized that the Commission would need to collaborate with Ripple and reference current bills in Congress related to digital assets. By doing so, the SEC would recognize that crypto assets resemble commodities more than securities and may not fall under its regulatory authority. As reported by CoinGape, Judge Torres denied the SEC’s motion against Ripple, calling it “procedurally improper.” The SEC had requested relief from the injunction and sought to reduce the civil penalty to $50 million. To win the motion, Deaton thinks the SEC would have to persuade Judge Torres that Ripple’s sales of XRP caused no harm and that the injunction is preventing Ripple from conducting business—specifically from selling XRP to financial institutions. He also observed that the SEC would need to argue that the injunction poses its main harm to an American company and its prospective business partners. Judge Torres also pointed out that a district court ruling in favor of an indicative ruling motion must determine whether the proposed consent decree is fair and reasonable without risking harm to the public’s interest by including injunctive relief in the decree. Another legal expert outlines steps and timeline for challenging XRP judgment Attorney Fred Rispoli echoed Deaton’s sentiment, noting that getting a favorable new judgment to replace the existing judgment in the XRP suit would be an uphill battle. He proposed that both parties should file a 25-page motion listing all of the other cases that both have dismissed. Rispoli also suggested that the SEC submit declarations from its Commissioners and admit that the Commission has fallen short in its efforts to provide the market with clear guidance on crypto. He assumes the agency will take that approach, but it could be two to three weeks before Ripple and the SEC each complete their arguments and refile the motion. Rispoli then anticipates that Judge Torres will need another one or two weeks to decide. Following Judge Torres’ latest decision, the price of XRP fell more than 4%. At the time of writing, the altcoin is trading near $2.40, down almost 2% over the past 24 hours. SEC faces internal backlash over Ripple settlement Adding to the case’s complexity, internal disagreements have surfaced within the SEC itself. On May 8, the SEC and Ripple jointly filed a settlement letter in a New York court requesting the dissolution of the August 2024 injunction against Ripple and proposing that $75 million of the $125 million in civil penalties held in escrow be returned to the crypto company. SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw, known for her skeptical stance on crypto, blasted the pending deal in a May 8 statement, saying it would damage the regulators’ ability to keep crypto firms in line and undermine the court’s ruling. “This settlement, alongside the programmatic disassembly of the SEC’s crypto enforcement program, does a tremendous disservice to the investing public and undermines the court’s role in interpreting our securities laws,” she said. Her remarks highlight the growing divide within the Commission and raise broader concerns about the SEC’s consistency in addressing the rapidly evolving crypto landscape.

Over $22B in RWAs are now on-chain, led by institutional giants like BlackRock and Hamilton Lane. A five-layer DeFi stack automates strategy, rewards, and compounding, requiring users to hold only one token. Solv Protocol has introduced SolvBTC.AVAX, a token that links Bitcoin to real-world asset (RWA) yields. Built on Avalanche, the product allows users to earn returns from traditional financial instruments while holding BTC on-chain. Users deposit BTC.b or SolvBTC and receive SolvBTC.AVAX, gaining exposure to tokenized assets like U.S. Treasuries and private credit. The strategy uses an automated vault to manage deposits. Once BTC is converted to SolvBTC.AVAX, the protocol routes capital into yield-generating positions without requiring manual intervention. This integration aims to transform Bitcoin from a dormant asset into a productive one. The product taps into a rising trend in crypto: the tokenization of traditional assets.

While PEPE , TRUMP , and Solana (SOL) have made waves in early 2025 , a quieter shift is unfolding beneath the surface—and MAGACOINFINANCE is emerging as a project quietly positioning for breakout. Unlike hype-driven pumps, MAGACOINFINANCE has opted for a deliberate growth path, combining a compelling political angle with disciplined token economics. Though still under the radar for many, its traction is beginning to accelerate. EARLY ACCESS ENDING SOON – ACT NOW Growing Attention as Investors Rotate into Value As of early May, MAGACOINFINANCE remains in its structured pre-sale phase, steadily building both its user base and community engagement across platforms like Discord and Twitter/X. This expansion is taking place at a time when investor sentiment is shifting—from overhyped launches to smaller, undervalued tokens with strong narratives. With broader interest forming around rotation trades, MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining visibility among early movers and contrarian investors alike. Uptick in On-Chain Metrics and Wallet Activity Traders seeking overlooked opportunities are taking note of MAGACOINFINANCE for more than just its branding. Wallet analysis now shows increased inflows from mid-sized Ethereum wallets, often associated with early-stage venture plays. While volumes remain modest, these signs mirror pre-rally accumulation patterns seen in previous market cycles. In addition to rising community interest, its new tokenomics design—featuring time-locked releases and open developer wallets—aims to avoid the liquidity pitfalls common to meme-driven tokens. Tokenomics That Encourage Loyalty, Not Dumping Whereas most tokens struggle to sustain price post-launch, MAGACOINFINANCE integrates mechanisms to promote holding. Controlled liquidity access, transparent supply caps, and structured token vesting have helped it avoid early dumping, attracting more serious long-term holders. This stability-first approach sets it apart in a landscape often dominated by short-lived momentum trades. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Is This the Breakout Rotation Trade of Summer 2025? Analysts are beginning to tag MAGACOINFINANCE in their rotation watchlists. Here’s what’s catching attention: Social Growth : A 60% surge in Twitter/X visibility over the past three weeks Holder Distribution : Balanced wallet distribution minimizes whale influence Engagement-to-Market Cap : Matching early FLOKI and TRUMP coin metrics from prior cycles These data points suggest that the token is being positioned for a strategic move. With altcoin rotation in full swing, MAGACOINFINANCE could become a standout from the smaller-cap sector. Conclusion: Quiet Today, But Not for Long Market interest is steadily shifting toward lower-cap, narrative-rich tokens that offer room to surprise. While projects like KASPA , XRP , and PEPE remain solid names, their large caps may limit near-term upside for new entrants. MAGACOINFINANCE , however, appears earlier in its cycle—right where long-term breakouts often begin. With increased on-chain signals, social traction, and a smart token design, this altcoin may soon move from quiet accumulation to center stage. Summer could tell the story—and MAGACOINFINANCE is writing the first chapters now.

44717019,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=752924,1747447218,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/44717019.jpeg,"Bitcoin Up $18,000, But HODLer Profits Same As On April 1—Here’s Why",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-17000-hodler-profits-april-1-heres-why/,"On-chain data shows the profit margin of the Bitcoin long-term holders is currently the same as when BTC was still $85,000. Here’s what’s behind this. Bitcoin Long-Term Holder NUPL Has Returned To 0.69 In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about the trend in the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) for the Bitcoin long-term holders. The NUPL is an indicator that keeps track of the difference between the unrealized profit and unrealized loss held by the BTC investors as a whole. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could See Short-Term Holder Selloff Around These Levels, Analyst Says When the value of this metric is positive, it means the holders are carrying more profit than loss. On the other hand, it being under zero suggests the average address is underwater. In the context of the current topic, the NUPL of the entire network isn’t of relevance, but rather that of just one segment of it: the long-term holders (LTHs). The LTHs refer to the BTC investors who have been holding onto their coins since more than 155 days ago. Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the Bitcoin NUPL for the LTHs over the past year: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin LTH NUPL has remained above the zero level for the past year, implying that the HODLers of the market have stayed in the green. But naturally, as the BTC price has shown some volatile moves in this period, the indicator’s value has also witnessed some fluctuations. From the chart, it’s apparent that the bull run at the end of 2024 took the indicator into an extreme territory, but the market downturn this year resulted in a cooldown for it. With the recent price recovery run, the metric again noted a reversal, but even at its peak, it still couldn’t come close to touching the high from the earlier bull run. An interesting trend has followed since this latest peak in the Bitcoin LTH NUPL; the indicator has observed a sharp retrace, despite the fact that the coin’s value has only been moving flat in this window. The metric is now sitting at 0.69, which is the same level as back at the start of April, when the cryptocurrency was still just trading around $85,000. What’s making it so that HODLer profitability is the same today despite the price being notably higher? And what’s the reason for the latest decline in the metric even though the price has been going sideways? Related Reading: Ethereum Bullish Signal: $1.2 Billion In ETH Leaves Exchanges The answer to these questions lies in what the LTH group represents. As mentioned earlier, this cohort includes investors who purchased their Bitcoin within the past 155 days. This five-month cutoff now includes the buyers from December 2024. In other words, the promotion of these top buyers into the group has diluted the unrealized gain among its members. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $103,500, up over 1% in the last 24 hours.

Currently trading around $651.79, BNB has remained within a key channel between $642.29 and $654.97. Despite short-term consolidation, the token’s value proposition remains intact, with broader use in gas fees, token launches, and DeFi integrations. While volume has declined, analysts believe a close near the $654.97 resistance could initiate a fresh test of the $660 level. However, from a midterm perspective, BNB is likely to remain range-bound between $600 and $650—signaling accumulation in a relatively stable zone.Amid these developments, Qubetics ($TICS) is emerging as the top crypto with 100x potential for those looking to solve critical privacy, security, and accessibility issues. Unlike its predecessors, Qubetics delivers decentralized internet utilities that tackle today’s most pressing digital challenges. Through real-world application and groundbreaking architecture, it offers enterprise and personal solutions in a format built for scale, sustainability, and everyday use. One such innovation is its Decentralized VPN , designed to transform how professionals and businesses interact online. Theta is gaining momentum across Europe, beginning with its upcoming May 27th community and developer meetup in Munich, followed by preparations for September’s highly anticipated ThetaEuroCon in Berlin. The network continues to deliver real-world use cases in decentralized video streaming, edge computing, and data delivery—all powered by its two-token system: THETA and TFUEL. As household names like Google, Sony, and Samsung back Theta as Enterprise Validators, and the platform opens up to EVM-compatible DApp deployment, it’s evident that Theta is positioning itself as a critical infrastructure layer for the decentralized internet. Qubetics ($TICS): Decentralized VPN Powering Privacy, Anonymity, and Accessibility Qubetics introduces a Decentralized VPN (dVPN) system that gives users control over their digital identity and traffic like never before. Unlike centralized VPNs that store user data, control exit nodes, and are vulnerable to shutdowns or surveillance, Qubetics offers a permissionless privacy layer powered by blockchain infrastructure. This dVPN is censorship-resistant, peer-to-peer, and fully encrypted—empowering individuals, remote teams, and businesses with secure and anonymous access to the global internet. Digital nomads, financial professionals, activists, and large-scale enterprises alike can route data through a decentralized web, eliminating centralized bottlenecks and surveillance risks. Through integrated token-based access, users can pay in $TICS for secure bandwidth, while node providers are compensated in real-time. This decentralized privacy utility redefines how people work, transact, and collaborate globally—without ever compromising on trust or transparency. The combination of high throughput, real-world accessibility, and seamless user integration makes Qubetics one of the most transformative protocols launching today—and a standout in any discussion of the top crypto with 100x potential . Explosive Qubetics Presale Performance and High-ROI Entry Point The Qubetics crypto presale is currently in Stage 34, where the $TICS token is priced at $0.2532. So far, over 512 million tokens have been sold to 26,500+ holders, raising a total of more than $17 million. Those who entered during Stage 1 at $0.01 per token are now seeing a return of 2,432%, validating the project’s strong fundamentals and demand among early adopters. However, the presale is not over. Community members can still enter the ongoing stage at $0.2532 and potentially achieve high ROI outcomes as the project matures. According to current projections: $TICS at $1 would yield a 294% ROI. $TICS at $5 delivers a 1,874% ROI. $TICS at $6 produces a 2,269% ROI. $TICS at $10 unlocks a 3,848% ROI. $TICS at $15 results in a 5,822% ROI after mainnet launch. With the dVPN feature and other high-utility modules integrated into its roadmap, Qubetics offers not only access but also functional value that meets pressing demands in digital infrastructure. Those seeking the top crypto with 100x potential should pay close attention before the window to participate narrows further. Theta (THETA): Enterprise-Backed Video Delivery and EVM-Based Smart Contracts Theta has built a strong reputation as the go-to blockchain platform for decentralized video delivery. It solves longstanding challenges in centralized streaming—such as high costs, lag, and poor user monetization—by creating a peer-to-peer video content delivery network where participants share bandwidth and are rewarded in TFUEL tokens. The dual-token system (THETA and TFUEL) supports everything from governance to micro-transactions, making Theta a robust decentralized economy. Backed by major companies including Google, Samsung, Sony, and Binance, Theta is now expanding its community engagement in Europe through the Theta World Tour . The Munich meetup on May 27th marks a strategic checkpoint for building momentum ahead of ThetaEuroCon in Berlin. These events are designed to align developers, partners, and content creators toward the platform’s mission of shaping the future of media through blockchain. Theta’s EVM-compatibility further opens the door to seamless DApp integration, allowing developers to deploy smart contracts without reworking Ethereum-based code. This flexibility, coupled with its global validator network and mass-adoption potential, cements Theta’s position as a top crypto with 100x potential . Binance Coin (BNB): Exchange Utility and Ecosystem Integration BNB remains a central utility token within the Binance ecosystem, serving as the engine behind a wide range of functions, including trading fee discounts, token sales, DEX operations, and DeFi integrations. Trading near $651.79 , BNB has remained confined between $642.29 and $654.97 , with short-term volatility subdued by lower volume. From a mid-term outlook, the token appears poised to continue sideways trading between $600 and $650 —indicating stability amid market churn. However, BNB’s value is not solely price-dependent. Its utility stretches across Binance’s vast product suite, including the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), NFT platforms, staking, and cross-chain liquidity tools. This makes BNB indispensable for daily users of Binance services, and its burn mechanism ensures long-term scarcity. BNB’s strength lies in its integration across one of the world’s most widely used crypto ecosystems. This gives it a strong case as a top crypto with 100x potential —not due to speculative surges, but because of reliable infrastructure growth and token use consolidation. Final Thoughts Qubetics, Theta, and BNB each represent unique avenues into the future of blockchain-powered solutions. Qubetics stands out with its decentralized VPN and presale traction, Theta continues to transform digital media with real utility and enterprise validation, and BNB powers one of the most comprehensive crypto platforms in existence. For early buyers, the Qubetics presale still offers a powerful entry point with measurable upside. Theta’s roadmap is gaining traction globally, while BNB offers stable exposure to the centralized-decentralized hybrid future. These are not just speculative tokens—they are utility-based projects shaping tomorrow’s digital economy. To secure a position in a blockchain future driven by application, performance, and community utility, the time to act is now. These are the top crypto with 100x potential —but access at this level won’t last long.

While major coins like Ethereum, XRP, and Dogecoin continue to consolidate with minimal upside, MAGACOINFINANCE is quietly moving in a different direction. Early chatter suggests this might be one of the few tokens still capable of delivering outsized returns — with a confirmed Uniswap listing at $0.007 and speculation of much higher valuations to come. Early Momentum Is Building Fast There’s no viral TikTok campaign or celebrity endorsement here — just steady growth and focused execution. Since its launch, MAGACOINFINANCE has gained traction primarily through grassroots interest , backed by a combination of meme appeal, strong tokenomics, and precise communication with its community. It’s a formula that reminds seasoned investors of what made tokens like SHIBA INU and PEPE take off. But what’s different here is the project’s deliberate pacing — and the clear pricing strategy that early buyers are paying close attention to. Why Investors Are Watching the $0.007 Milestone Closely According to sources close to the project, MAGACOINFINANCE is preparing for an initial listing at $0.007 — and this price is already serving as a benchmark for investor models. But the conversation doesn’t end there. Some analysts have projected the token could reach $0.07 on Tier 1 exchanges if adoption continues to scale — a 240x return based on early positioning. More speculative models suggest that if MAGACOINFINANCE becomes a truly global meme coin, a price point of $0.70 is not out of reach — a massive 2,400x multiple . While these higher-end scenarios are hypothetical, what matters is that investors have measurable, structured milestones — and that’s rare in the current wave of meme-driven tokens. More Than Just Hype — Community Growth Signals Real Potential On-chain activity and social analytics platforms show a steady increase in engagement around MAGACOINFINANCE . Telegram chats are expanding, Twitter mentions are climbing, and wallet distribution appears healthy — all key signs of sustainable early momentum. What’s resonating most with buyers, though, is the sense of starting fresh . Many in the space missed out on the early days of TrumpCoin, DOGE, or SHIBA — and MAGACOINFINANCE is now offering a second chance to be early on a politically-themed, community-driven crypto with actual structure behind it. A Calculated Entry in a Hype-Driven Market In a market filled with noise, MAGACOINFINANCE is quietly gaining favor among those who are looking for a strategic entry , not just another viral meme. It’s not being force-fed through influencers or overhyped social trends — instead, it’s growing through a consistent rollout and rising organic interest. With the $0.007 listing on the horizon , and discussions of reaching 240x or even 2,400x in the next cycle, MAGACOINFINANCE is starting to look like one of the few remaining early-stage projects with real upside .

According to a May 15 statement from Paraguayan prosecutor Irene Rolón , the men were caught by police soon after breaking into a locked section of Teratech SA’s facility in Coronel Bogado, leading to their arrest. Prosecutors believe the men may have had ties to Teratech as independent contractors, but are still waiting on official confirmation from the company’s CEO. The three deported were Chinese nationals Jinping Duan, Tian Jianyun and Zheng Guanglong, who did not have official entry records into the country. Paraguayan authorities and Interpol believe the men illegally entered through Brazil or Bolivia. The three deported Chinese nationals pictured before leaving the country.

He has been charged with aggravated theft and is currently in pretrial detention. The arrested individual was hospitalized in critical condition soon after the arrest, but the injuries sustained weren’t disclosed. Paraguayan officials believe other individuals were involved in the attempted theft and are working to identify those people. As such, the case is still under investigation. Deportees may have been working illegally for months Rolón believes the undocumented immigrants had been in Paraguay for several months and had come to work as programmers. However, it isn’t clear whether that work was performed for the company. Paraguayan officials are waiting on a report from Teratech’s CEO to determine the exact nature of his relationship with the three men.

Letter Rejects “False Choice” Co-founder Zach Witkoff released a May 15 letter to Senator Richard Blumenthal in which company attorneys said lawmakers’ concerns were based on “fundamentally flawed premises and inaccuracies.” “The Company rejects the false choice between innovation and oversight,” the letter argued. “What it opposes is the misuses of regulatory authority and uncertainty to suppress lawful innovation.” WLFI maintains that questions surrounding its USD1 stablecoin do not warrant sweeping investigations that could stall development. Democrats Press Conflict-of-Interest Angle Blumenthal, ranking member of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, has rallied Democrats to examine potential conflicts stemming from former President Donald Trump’s stake in WLFI, his TRUMP memecoin, and a forthcoming dinner for top tokenholders. The senator warned that “WLFI’s financial entanglements with the President, his family, and the Trump Administration present unprecedented conflicts of interest and national security risks, including potential violations of the foreign emoluments clause.” Stablecoin Bill Could Decide the Matter Attention is now fixed on the GENIUS Act, a Republican-sponsored measure that would grant payment-instrument status to certain stablecoins. Should USD1 qualify under the legislation, critics fear Trump could benefit financially while also influencing the regulatory environment in which the product operates. Some Democrats have proposed amendments to ensure no sitting or former president can profit from a stablecoin they could later help legitimize. WLFI Says It Is “Too Busy Building” Despite the political storm, Witkoff insists the team is focused on launching products and onboarding users rather than lobbying. He characterizes oversight efforts as distractions that risk pushing stablecoin innovation offshore. What Happens Next The GENIUS Act’s timeline remains unclear, and Senate leadership has not scheduled a vote. If the bill advances, expect renewed scrutiny of WLFI’s cap table and the extent of Trump family involvement.

Lightchain AI Investors Brace for Big Gains,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/dogecoins-dip-the-calm-before-the-bull-run-lightchain-ai-investors-brace-for-big-gains/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) is presently experiencing a decline, leaving many experts discussing the chances of a bullish rebound. Meanwhile, Lightchain AI has been gaining a lot of attention and attraction among investors. This new project combines blockchain technology with artificial intelligence, emerging as the best choice for investors looking into the future. Currently, the presale is at $0.007, with Lightchain AI raising over $20 million in funding, showing that investors trust the project. With its special approach and clear roadmap, Lightchain AI has been predicted to lead the market when the next boom happens. Dogecoin’s Decline- Setup for Potential Bullish Comeback? Dogecoin (DOGE) has crashed, falling more than 30% in the last few months. However, its technical indicators show that the token could witness a turnaround. The falling wedge and a potential triple bottom around the $0.168 support, all these points that the token is now close to the bulls. In addition, the rise in whale holdings and social media noise shows that investors are still interested in the token. Analysts have also predicted that a move above $0.18 would push the asset towards $0.20, with some predicting that the asset could even move as igh as $0.22 should the bulls hold on. And although the market is still volatile, these events suggest that Dogecoin could mount a comeback. Why Lightchain AI is Standing Out in Changing Market Lightchain AI is quickly becoming an important player in the crypto industry, thanks to its approach of mixing blockchain and AI, solving past issues. The platform’s governance system ensures that token holders have the power to make changes through a decentralized democratic process, ensuring transparency and inclusivity. Using on-chain voting, the community can actively participate in shaping the platform’s future, build trust, and collaborate. By decentralizing AI model training and decision-making, Lightchain AI addresses issues like bias and centralized control, ensuring fairness and reducing the dominance of monopolies. The project’s need for interoperability ensures smooth integration with other blockchains and popular AI frameworks, ensuring usability and adoption. These features make Lightchain AI one of the best projects, gaining attention in today’s ever-growing market. Lightchain AI- Future of Blockchain Meets AI Innovation Lightchain AI has been turning the crypto world upside down, and investors are still not satisfied. This is not just another crypto project, it is one of the best. By adding the potential of blockchain with AI, Lightchain AI is breaking the barrier that would have kept this technology from reaching the public. Smart investors are not waiting around as they have recognized this project as an early opportunity to make profits so they are jumping in. Lightchain is more than just a new project, it is a movement that is driven by the power of its community. Transparency, fairness, and decentralized decision-making are at its core, perfectly matching the demands for equity and inclusivity in the crypto ecosystem. The crypto space is changing fast, and Lightchain AI is leading the move towards a decentralized and fairer future. Don’t get left behind–be part of the best new thing.

Over the past two weeks, DOGE has risen by more than 25%, pushing its price as high as $0.24. Despite this growth, the asset experienced a slight pullback in the past 24 hours, retreating by 0.3% to $0.22 at the time of writing. The latest movements mark a period of renewed interest in the asset, particularly from retail traders. Related Reading: Dogecoin Pullback May Be Short-Lived—Here’s The Next Price Target Dogecoin Retail Activity and Sentiment Indicators One of CryptoQuant’s contributors, Burak Kesmeci, recently shared new insights into DOGE’s futures market activity. In a post titled “Too Many Retail Traders? DOGE Futures Show Repeated Peak Patterns”, Kesmeci pointed to the potential influence of speculative trading behavior. His analysis highlights that previous peaks in Dogecoin’s price have often coincided with a sharp increase in retail participation in futures markets, raising questions about the sustainability of such rallies. Kesmeci’s analysis centers around a visual metric that tracks trading activity from retail investors within DOGE futures markets. In this chart, red bubbles mark moments when retail trading spikes significantly. These periods, according to the analyst, have historically aligned with local price tops, suggesting that elevated speculative behavior often precedes short-term corrections. On the other hand, green and pink bubbles, representing periods of reduced retail activity, have typically aligned with more stable or neutral price phases. The underlying interpretation is that when DOGE futures markets become saturated with retail participants, the likelihood of momentum exhaustion increases. For traders, these retail spikes may serve as potential warning signals of short-term reversals. As Kesmeci notes, this data can be used in conjunction with other technical and on-chain metrics to build a more comprehensive view of market sentiment, especially in volatile assets like Dogecoin. The analysis supports a more cautious approach where retail enthusiasm dominates trading volumes. Technical Forecast Suggests Possible Rally Continuation While futures data indicates caution around potential retail-driven tops, other technical perspectives suggest the possibility of further upside. Crypto analyst Javon Marks recently shared an outlook indicating that DOGE may be positioned for a continuation toward a new all-time high. Related Reading: Where’s Next Major Dogecoin Resistance?

Designed to meet the expectations of serious investors, it combines professional auditing, well-considered tokenomics, and a transparent development team — creating a framework that supports sustainable traction. With a growing community and clear interest across crypto channels , MAGACOINFINANCE is not positioning itself as a quick trend, but as a long-term player aligned with best practices in decentralized finance. This review takes a closer look at the essential elements that are fueling the project’s early rise. THE CLOCK IS TICKING FAST – ACT NOW Verified by Hashex: A Strong Signal of Security and Oversight Perhaps the most important development to date is the completion of a full smart contract audit by Hashex , a respected name in blockchain security. The audit assessed MAGACOINFINANCE for structural vulnerabilities, ensuring that the project meets key thresholds for integrity, transparency, and protection against contract-level exploits. A successful audit at this stage provides two essential benefits: Investor trust — with technical validation confirming the absence of critical risks. Market reputation — helping MAGACOINFINANCE distinguish itself from the many unaudited tokens that populate the space. In a market where early-stage scams remain a real concern, passing a Hashex audit is a strong endorsement of project legitimacy . Tokenomics Designed for Stability and Ecosystem Growth MAGACOINFINANCE introduces a balanced tokenomics model built around long-term sustainability. Rather than overpromising or engineering aggressive short-term gains, the token structure reflects a thoughtful allocation model, designed to support the ecosystem, reward early participants, and protect overall market health. While exact distribution percentages are kept simple for broader accessibility, it is evident that the developers have focused on designing a structure that encourages responsible participation and community growth — a key differentiator in today’s volatile presale environment. Token Sale Success Highlights Investor Confidence MAGACOINFINANCE’s early token sale performance has exceeded expectations , with notable demand emerging shortly after the project went live. From individual investors to private communities, the response has been swift and positive — an indicator of the trust being placed in the project’s foundation. The fast-paced nature of the sale reflects rising momentum , as well as a broader desire among investors to identify opportunities that pair innovation with a clear commitment to compliance and transparency. In that respect, MAGACOINFINANCE is delivering a rare mix of credibility and upside potential. Why MAGACOINFINANCE Has Everyone Watching Closely As the broader altcoin market prepares for what many analysts expect to be an active cycle, projects like MAGACOINFINANCE — those that enter with security audits, clear tokenomics, and real-time traction — are earning fast recognition. Industry observers and early-stage analysts have flagged MAGACOINFINANCE as a token with the essential qualities needed to survive beyond the initial hype phase . Its strategy of prioritizing infrastructure and transparency from day one is paying off, as more investors gravitate toward projects with tangible credibility. CLICK HERE – 25x GROWTH STILL ON THE TABLE Conclusion: MAGACOINFINANCE Is Building the Right Way Unlike many short-lived crypto launches, MAGACOINFINANCE is setting the tone for how responsible altcoin projects should approach market entry . With a completed Hashex audit , clearly communicated tokenomics, and successful initial momentum, it is paving a path that combines security, structure, and scalable investor participation. This is a project designed with long-term thinking in mind — and for that reason alone, it deserves the attention it is receiving across the crypto community.

What’s more surprising? Traders from two of the largest meme coin communities — Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) — are flocking in, eager to secure positions before the presale window closes. Why DOGE and SHIB Traders Are Paying Attention Dogecoin, long considered the king of memecoins, is holding strong around $0.17 , buoyed by ETF rumors and renewed on-chain activity. Shiba Inu, meanwhile, has recently surged to $0.00001325 , boosted by token burns and Shibarium network upgrades. But despite these successes, DOGE and SHIB traders are seasoned enough to know that the biggest gains often come from early-stage plays — and MAGACOINFINANCE is shaping up to be just that. MAGACOINFINANCE: The Sleeper Altcoin With 25x Potential JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOINFINANCE has already raised over $8 million in its presale and is still priced under $0.001 , with a target listing price of $0.007 . That sets the stage for a potential 25x–36x ROI — one of the most attractive setups in the altcoin space right now. Early investors using the MAGA50X bonus code can also unlock a 50% token bonus , adding even more firepower to their allocations. What’s next: Major exchange listings, viral marketing campaigns, and a growing ecosystem. What the future holds: A politically charged, meme-fueled altcoin that’s engineered for long-term relevance. Why it’s still worth joining now at Stage 7, 8, 9: Early-stage access is where the real upside lives, and investors are being reminded they’re still early. MAGACOINFINANCE is built to last , with an independent smart contract audit, scarcity-driven tokenomics, and one of the fastest-growing online communities in crypto. Traders often regret missing the earliest stages of a breakout project. MAGACOINFINANCE’s rapid rise across presale stages is a clear signal: momentum is building, and the window to join before exchange listings is narrowing fast. Final Takeaway CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT For DOGE and SHIB investors looking to lock in their next high-upside win, MAGACOINFINANCE is becoming the altcoin to watch.

Unlike traditional security systems, blockchain uses decentralized networks that make it nearly impossible to alter or hack information. This level of protection addresses growing cybersecurity threats that many organizations face today. By integrating blockchain, companies gain enhanced transparency, data integrity and trust. The adoption of blockchain technology is no longer limited to finance. Industries such as healthcare, supply chain and government are harnessing blockchain integration to safeguard sensitive data. Its immutable ledger system ensures every transaction is recorded with a timestamp, making fraud and unauthorized access easier to detect and prevent. How blockchain integration enhances cybersecurity Blockchain integration improves cybersecurity by decentralizing data storage. Instead of relying on a single server, blockchain distributes information across a network of nodes. This approach reduces the risk of data breaches since hackers must compromise multiple points simultaneously. The cryptographic techniques embedded in blockchain add another protective layer, ensuring data remains confidential and tamper-proof. Moreover, blockchain integration allows for secure identity management. Users can control their data with cryptographic keys, reducing reliance on passwords that are vulnerable to phishing attacks. This shift enhances privacy while maintaining accessibility for authorized parties. It also supports secure sharing of information without exposing raw data, which is crucial in industries handling sensitive details. Blockchain integration in healthcare data protection Healthcare data is one of the most sensitive types of information, often targeted by cybercriminals. Blockchain integration offers a solution by creating a secure, tamper-proof record of patient information. This means medical records cannot be altered without detection, improving both data integrity and patient trust. In addition, blockchain supports interoperability among healthcare providers. Secure data exchange enables better coordination of care while maintaining patient confidentiality. Smart contracts on the blockchain can automate consent management, allowing patients to control who accesses their data with clear audit trails. Securing supply chain data with blockchain integration Supply chains involve many parties – from manufacturers to retailers – each generating data critical to product integrity and authenticity. Blockchain integration provides an immutable record of every step in the supply chain, reducing fraud and ensuring transparency. This creates accountability and enables quick tracing of products in case of defects or recalls. By using blockchain, companies also streamline compliance with regulations. The technology’s transparency simplifies audits and reporting, while secure data sharing fosters collaboration among partners without compromising proprietary information. Ultimately, blockchain strengthens trust between consumers and brands by verifying product origin and handling. Blockchain integration transforming financial industry security The financial sector was an early adopter of blockchain integration due to its high security needs. Blockchain protects transactions by recording them on a distributed ledger, eliminating single points of failure. This drastically reduces fraud, money laundering and identity theft risks. Additionally, blockchain enables faster, more secure cross-border payments. It cuts down on intermediaries, lowers transaction costs and provides real-time tracking. Financial institutions benefit from improved regulatory compliance through transparent and verifiable transaction histories. Government applications of blockchain integration for data security Governments manage vast amounts of citizen data that must remain secure and accessible only to authorized users. Blockchain integration offers a resilient infrastructure for voting systems, land registries and identity verification. By providing a tamper-proof record, blockchain helps prevent election fraud and corruption. Furthermore, blockchain facilitates secure public service delivery by enabling transparent and accountable workflows. Citizens gain confidence in government actions as blockchain promotes open auditing and data integrity. This technological integration builds trust between governments and the people they serve. Conclusion – T he future of data security with blockchain integration Blockchain integration is redefining data security standards across various industries. Its decentralized, transparent and tamper-resistant nature provides unmatched protection against cyber threats. As more sectors adopt this technology, they unlock new opportunities for secure data sharing, compliance and operational efficiency. The ongoing advancements in blockchain promise an even stronger security landscape. Organizations that embrace blockchain integration will stay ahead in protecting their data and earning the trust of their stakeholders. This shift is not just a technological upgrade but a fundamental change in how we safeguard information.

However, five new cryptocurrencies are gearing up for remarkable growth next year. With the potential to soar by up to 16,900%, these digital assets might soon overshadow Bitcoin. This article delves into these up-and-coming contenders that could redefine the future of cryptocurrency. Undervalued $XYZ Meme Coin Gears Up for Listing on a Major CEX XYZVerse ($XYZ) is the meme coin that has grabbed headlines with its ambitious claim of rising from $0.0001 to $0.1 during a presale phase. So far, it has gone halfway, raising over $13 million, and the price of the $XYZ token currently stands at $0.003333 . At the next 13th stage of the presale, the $XYZ token value will further rise to $0.005 , meaning that early investors have the chance to secure a bigger discount. Following the presale, $XYZ will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The team has not disclosed the details yet, but they have put a teaser for a big launch. Born for Fighters, Built for Champions XYZVerse is building a community for those hungry for big profits in crypto — the relentless, the ambitious, the ones aiming for dominance. This is a coin for true fighters — a mindset that resonates with athletes and sports fans alike. $XYZ is the token for thrill-seekers chasing the next big meme coin. Central to the XYZVerse story is XYZepe — a fighter in the meme coin arena, battling to climb the charts and make it to the top on CoinMarketCap. Will it become the next DOGE or SHIB? Time will tell. Community-First Vibes In XYZVerse, the community runs the show. Active participants earn hefty rewards, and the team has allocated a massive 10% of the total token supply — around 10 billion $XYZ — for airdrops, making it one of the largest airdrops on record. Backed by solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and regular token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every move is designed to boost momentum, drive price growth, and rally a loyal community that knows this could be the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More — Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Solana (SOL): A High-Performance Blockchain for Scalable Applications Solana is a blockchain platform designed for scalability and speed. It provides a foundation for decentralized applications (dapps), competing with platforms like Ethereum and Cardano. Solana’s architecture focuses on faster transactions and supports development in multiple programming languages. The native cryptocurrency, SOL, is central to the Solana ecosystem. It facilitates transactions, powers custom programs, and rewards participants who support the network. SOL holds value by underpinning the operation of the Solana ecosystem. It rewards network participants and gives users access to various projects on the platform. Unlike some blockchains, Solana does not use sharding or second-layer solutions to achieve scalability. Its high-capacity network aims to attract developers and investors interested in hosting products and services that require high activity. In the current market cycle, Solana’s focus on scalability and performance positions it as a notable option among blockchain platforms. BNB: The Native Cryptocurrency of the Binance Ecosystem BNB is the native cryptocurrency of the Binance platform, introduced in June 2017 as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. It now operates on both the Binance Chain and Binance Smart Chain. BNB facilitates fee payments, token issuance, and asset transfers within these networks. It supports smart contracts through a Proof-of-Staked Authority consensus mechanism, allowing users to earn rewards by staking. Beyond blockchain transactions, BNB provides fee discounts on Binance.com and is accepted by various third-party services. The supply of BNB is systematically reduced through quarterly burns, aiming to halve the initial supply of 200 million tokens. This reduction strategy can enhance the value of the remaining tokens over time. The combination of its utility in the Binance ecosystem, staking rewards, and supply reduction may make BNB an attractive option for users. In the current market cycle, BNB continues to play a significant role due to its versatile applications and the ongoing efforts to manage its supply. TRON (TRX): A Blockchain Platform for Decentralized Content and Applications TRON (TRX) is a decentralized blockchain platform launched by the Tron Foundation in 2017. TRX tokens were initially based on Ethereum’s ERC-20 standard but moved to their own network in 2018. The project aims to give full ownership rights to digital content creators by allowing them to receive rewards directly from consumers without intermediaries like YouTube or Facebook. TRON supports smart contracts, various blockchain systems, and decentralized applications (dApps). It uses a transaction model similar to Bitcoin’s UTXO, with transactions recorded on a public ledger accessible to all users. By enabling content creators to interact directly with consumers, TRON seeks to decentralize the internet and empower users. Developers can create dApps on the TRON network and offer content in exchange for digital assets. This model promotes open content sharing without concerns over transaction fees. As an alternative to Ethereum, TRON provides tools for building decentralized applications with potentially lower costs and higher scalability. Its potential for growth in the decentralized app sector makes it an interesting option in the current market cycle. Polkadot (DOT): Enhancing Interoperability in Blockchain Networks Polkadot is a decentralized protocol and cryptocurrency designed to enable secure communication between different blockchains. It allows value and data to be shared across networks like Ethereum and Bitcoin without intermediaries. This is achieved through the use of parachains, which improve speed and scalability. Polkadot processes transactions more efficiently than Bitcoin and Ethereum. The native token, DOT, is used for governance and staking within the network. DOT holders can participate in the development of the protocol and the transaction verification process. Polkadot was developed by Gavin Wood, a co-creator of Ethereum, and launched on May 26, 2020, under the maintenance of the Web3 Foundation. Polkadot addresses the challenge of interoperability among blockchains. By facilitating communication between different networks, it opens opportunities for more integrated and versatile applications. The parachain architecture helps overcome scalability issues found in other blockchain platforms. In the current market cycle, Polkadot’s approach to interoperability and scalability presents it as a notable option in the blockchain space. Its technology aims to meet the growing demand for interconnected and efficient blockchain solutions. Conclusion While SOL, BNB, TRX, and DOT show promise for huge gains, XYZVerse (XYZ) aims even higher with a 20,000% growth target, uniting sports fans in a unique memecoin ecosystem.

SHIB is holding steady near key support levels. XRP is building up with strong chart signals. BlockDAG (BDAG) , however, is making waves with a massive $251 million raise and a big reveal event scheduled for June 13. This reveal will include the final 15 exchange listings for BDAG, on top of the five already confirmed. The team has hinted at major U.S. exchanges but plans to keep those secret until the day arrives. Unlike many projects that wait until launch to share listing updates, BlockDAG is flipping the script. The June 13 reveal is not the launch day. The actual launch will happen when BlockDAG’s presale reaches its $600 million target. Until then, the project is offering a frozen entry price of $0.0020. This approach highlights preparation, confidence, and structure as the project pushes forward toward one of the year’s most-watched releases. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Finds Support Amid Technical Stability SHIB maintains its support around $0.00001690, with a 7% jump within 24 hours. Analysts point to strong support from the 20, 50, 100, and 200 exponential moving averages. The 20 EMA offers a solid base at $0.00001560, giving SHIB a chance to hold firm and rise again. Technical analysis shows SHIB forming a continuation flag on its 4-hour chart. If support near $0.00001650 remains strong, SHIB might retest its earlier highs. Some analysts believe it could aim for $0.000095 later in the year. While it may not repeat its explosive 2021 surge, the chart setup gives SHIB a decent shot at generating gains in the near term. The coin’s structure suggests it still has room to climb in the next few months if current support zones stay intact and trading volume increases gradually. XRP Builds Toward All-Time High on Whale Activity XRP is trading near $2.45 after gaining 3.19% in a day and rising about 20% in a month. Analysts say it is moving into a breakout pattern, backed by strong volume and a bullish triangle formation. Support remains firm at $1.75, while eyes are now on higher resistance points. One driver behind this growth is the activity from large holders. A recent $5.84 million long position opened by a whale has boosted market confidence. With increasing volume and a solid setup, analysts expect the current momentum to continue. If this pattern holds and broader crypto market sentiment doesn’t shift, XRP could make another attempt to test its previous all-time highs. The structure looks promising for those watching key technical signals and chart indicators. BlockDAG’s $251M Raise and Exchange Reveal Gain Traction While SHIB and XRP show signs of growth through chart patterns, BlockDAG is grabbing attention for its milestones. It has now raised over $251 million, with Batch 28 priced at $0.0262, offering a 2,520% increase from its starting batch. More than 20.4 billion coins have already been sold. The highlight is its June 13 Go Live Reveal, where BlockDAG will share the final list of 20 exchanges for BDAG listings. Five are already named: MEXC, LBank, CoinStore, XT.com, and BitMart. The remaining 15 are being kept under wraps until the reveal. This isn’t the official launch but a strategic midpoint. The actual listing will take place once the presale hits $600 million. Until June 13, the project has locked the price at $0.0020, marking a final entry point before it adjusts to market rates. More progress is coming from its hardware side. BlockDAG confirmed that miner shipment videos will be released soon. Devices like the X10, X30, and X100 are being prepared for customers. Over $7 million worth of miners have been sold, totalling 17,525 units so far. BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles is also in headlines, where 100 million coins are up for grabs daily. The biggest buyer of the day receives any leftover supply, adding a new layer of excitement to the presale. Wrapping It Up SHIB shows firm support, and XRP’s rise suggests a potential push toward old highs. But BlockDAG is taking the spotlight for its sharp execution and forward planning. With a $251 million raise, confirmed exchange listings, and physical miner deliveries underway, BlockDAG looks well prepared for its next phase. The Go Live Reveal on June 13 will unveil the full trading roadmap across 20 exchanges. Until that date, the entry price is frozen at $0.0020. Afterwards, with listings going public and momentum building, pricing will shift based on demand and market activity. As SHIB and XRP follow technical patterns, BlockDAG is carving a more structured path. That makes it one of the standout projects heading into the rest of 2025.

However, after reaching this level, the asset appears to have encountered resistance, with upward momentum slowing and price action remaining relatively flat in recent days. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $103,663, reflecting a modest 1.7% increase over the past 24 hours. Amid this price performance, one of CryptoQuant’s top analysts, Darkfost, offered insight into the current market stagnation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Stalls as SOPR Spikes: Analyst Explains What It Means Derivatives Market Activity Signals Short-Term Uncertainty According to his post on X, the root of the slowdown appears to stem from the derivatives market. Specifically, he pointed to the cumulative net taker volume, a metric that tracks the net volume of market orders, remaining in negative territory since BTC crossed above the psychological $100,000 threshold. This suggests that there are more aggressive sell orders (shorts) than buy orders (longs), creating persistent downward pressure on price. Net taker volume is a useful gauge of real-time trader sentiment, and when it trends negative, it typically signals that market participants expect prices to drop, prompting more short-selling. 📊 The main reason why BTC is currently stuck at these levels comes from the derivatives market. 💥The cumulative net taker volume has mostly remained in negative territory ever since BTC climbed back above the psychological $100 000 level. – What does this mean ? ⁰In simple… pic.twitter.com/2ABZ3qzQ0s — Darkfost (@Darkfost_Coc) May 16, 2025 Darkfost emphasized that this trend reflects increasing uncertainty among traders about Bitcoin’s short-term ability to reach new all-time highs. While long-term sentiment remains positive, the imbalance in derivatives activity highlights a cautious approach among participants. “It clearly reflects a growing sense of doubt among traders regarding Bitcoin’s ability to reach a new all-time high in the very short term,” he stated. “In such a context, the market loves to prove them wrong.” This sentiment-driven hesitation has slowed the pace of Bitcoin’s rally, even as it remains within striking distance of its January high. Bitcoin Technical Setup Hints at Bullish Continuation Meanwhile, technical analyst Javon Marks pointed to chart patterns suggesting a potential continuation of Bitcoin’s bullish trend. He highlighted the formation of a bull flag, a technical pattern often interpreted as a pause before the continuation of an upward movement. “Bitcoin looks to be bull flagging right under all-time highs. A breakout can send it above,” Marks wrote.

Additionally, Marks noted that altcoins are exhibiting similar behavior to previous market cycles, particularly the surges seen in 2017 and 2021. He suggested that the current phase may precede a broader altcoin rally, which historically tends to follow Bitcoin’s moves. Altcoins look to be moving similarly and right on track as it did in the 2017 and 2021 surges. The next phase looks to be where #Altcoins deliver the green light, or in other words push in their most bullish phases.

India is the world’s fourth-largest economy and a key buyer of many U.S. farm and tech goods. In an interview with Fox News host Bret Baier that aired Friday, Trump talked about trade relations with India with regard to improving U.S. exports. “They make it almost impossible to do business,” the president told Baier. “Do you know that they’re willing to cut 100 percent of their tariffs for the United States?” While making that claim, Trump offered mixed signals on how quickly a trade deal might follow. “That’ll come soon. I’m in no rush,” he said. “Look, everybody wants to make a deal with us.” He later added that he does not plan to “make deals with everybody.” The comments are the latest hint that the White House will continue to maintain tariffs on certain countries as a July pause on higher tariffs nears. Trump has said that the US will make decisions about unilateral tariffs for some nations. Earlier on Friday, the president told reporters he expects to announce fresh rates for trade partners “over the next two to three weeks.” Washington is prioritizing discussions with certain nations Officials say the administration wants to wrap up talks with several countries, including India, but limited staff and time mean Washington cannot hold full talks with every capital affected by the president’s reciprocal tariff plan. Trump also raised the idea of bigger trade ties with Pakistan, India’s rival. He previously said that trade was one major factor that helped broker a ceasefire deal between the two nuclear neighbors this month. “I’m using trade to settle scores and make peace,” he said. The United States has likewise worked to cool its clash with China. After talks last week, Washington cut its tariff rate on Chinese goods to 30 percent from 145 percent, while Beijing lowered its own tariffs on U.S. imports to 10 percent. “If I didn’t do that deal with China, I think China would have broken apart,” Trump said.

The win took place on Gates of Sportsbet.io , an exclusive game from Pragmatic Play only available to players on the world’s favourite crypto-led sports betting and casino site. Betting in the USDT stablecoin currency, the winning player spun just 240 USDT for the max win, which unfolded via a nerve-wracking free spins round. Alex Haig, Director at Sportsbet.io , said: “Moments like this are why we do what we do here at Sportsbet.io. It was incredible to see 240 USDT turn into 3.6 million USDT over the course of 15 remarkable free spins. I want to give a huge congratulations to the winner.

Investors are closely monitoring key assets that could lead the charge into the next altcoin season. Among the frontrunners are XRP, Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Ethereum (ETH), each displaying bullish indicators. Additionally, MAGACOINFINANCE is emerging as a noteworthy contender with significant growth potential. LIMITED TIME OFFER-GET 50% EXTRA BONUS WITH MAGA50X XRP: Poised for Breakout Currently trading at $2.59 , XRP has maintained a steady uptrend, bolstered by a surge in futures open interest exceeding $1 billion. This uptick indicates strong trader confidence and speculation on further gains. Analysts suggest that if XRP can break through the $2.60 resistance level, it could target the $3.00 mark in the near term. SHIBA INU: Consolidation Before Potential Surge Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently priced at $0.00001594 , showing signs of consolidation after recent highs. The meme coin remains popular among retail investors, and its price action suggests a potential second wave. Analysts forecast that if SHIB regains momentum, it could see a 3x to 4x upside, especially if trading volumes increase. Ethereum: Steady Climb with Institutional Support Ethereum (ETH) is trading around $2,614.45 , demonstrating resilience and attracting institutional interest. The asset has seen over $13 million in ETF inflows, indicating growing confidence among large-scale investors. With the potential for further adoption and network upgrades, ETH could aim for its previous highs, offering a 2x to 2.5x return. MAGACOINFINANCE: High-Risk, High-Reward Prospect MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining attention as a high reward investment opportunity. Currently in its presale phase, the token is priced under $0.001 , with projections suggesting a listing price of $0.007 . The project boasts tight tokenomics, a no-VC structure, and a strong community focus. Early investors could potentially see returns ranging from 25x to 36x, making it a compelling option for those seeking significant gains. Conclusion: A Balanced Portfolio for Altcoin Season As the market gears up for a potential altcoin season, XRP, SHIB, and ETH offer a mix of stability and growth potential.

The chart, which visually maps Bitcoin’s historical cycles and future price targets, suggests a trajectory that could see Bitcoin reaching the million-dollar milestone between 2027 and 2029. This forecast is significant for Bitcoin holders and carries positive implications for other major cryptocurrencies, including XRP. Bitcoin is going to $1,000,000 pic.twitter.com/2yVwLTgvGK — Ash Crypto (@Ashcryptoreal) May 15, 2025 The Crypto Market’s Strong 2025 Performance XRP has already experienced substantial momentum in 2025. The asset began this journey in late 2024, rising from $0.55 in November to $3.39 in January. Bitcoin has also shown remarkable strength. The asset broke above $100,000 in December and rose to an all-time high of $109,114 in January. Bitcoin’s rise helped the broader market grow significantly, and with the asset on the rise again, altcoins are experiencing a resurgence. Like XRP, Bitcoin spent months struggling, but Donald Trump’s recent trade deal with the U.K. caused it to surge past $100,000 again. XRP also experienced a notable surge, rising to $2.6 for the first time since March. Analysts now predict that XRP could reach $4.5-$6 by June . Additionally, if Bitcoin remains around the same level for the rest of the year, the analysis suggests that XRP could rise to $12. If it reaches $250,000, XRP could climb to $30, more than 10x its current price of $2.38. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The prospect of Bitcoin reaching $1 million would likely have a significantly more powerful spillover effect on the broader crypto market, further strengthening XRP’s outlook. Supporting Indicators for a Bull Run Ash Crypto’s chart is not the only bullish signal for Bitcoin. April 2025 saw Bitcoin gain over 14%, marking its strongest monthly close since January. Technical indicators and macroeconomic conditions support further gains with the asset holding strong above $100,000. As one community member pointed out , Bitcoin only has to rise 10x to hit this $1 million target. As global adoption grows and institutions flood the market, Bitcoin’s chances to hit this target keep rising. If Bitcoin reaches $1 million in the coming years, XRP is well-positioned to capitalize on the ensuing market enthusiasm and institutional adoption.

44721753,https://nulltx.com/?p=149703,1747458725,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Bitcoin Faces Resistance at Key Levels, But Market Sentiment Suggests a Potential Rally",https://nulltx.com/bitcoin-faces-resistance-at-key-levels-but-market-sentiment-suggests-a-potential-rally/,"Bitcoin’s price has encountered some pushback over the last week, as the cryptocurrency has found it difficult to transcend the key price range of $104,000 to $105,000. This brief living-in-a-range period has made some Bitcoin traders evasively turn in the direction of bears. In the world of cryptocurrency trading, however, that old adage about how you do business can often lead to counterintuitive market moves. Therefore, what some are interpreting as a new bear phase for Bitcoin could just as easily be the set-up for the next leg up. Bitcoin has seen some resistance over the past week, being challenged to grow past the $104K to $105K level. This temporary ""pumping of the brakes"" has been enough to swing traders slightly bearish once again. Markets generally tend to move opposite to crowd's expectations,… pic.twitter.com/7toBDE5y6f — Santiment (@santimentfeed) May 15, 2025 Many are now left to ponder whether the recent Bitcoin price action has left its upward momentum halted for the time being or if this is just a momentary pause before Bitcoin breaks out again. Fear has crept back into the market. With it, a heightening of the probability of a crypto market surge has come about: This probability increase was born of the notion that the anxiety increase is beginning to signal a new market surge for Bitcoin and the crypto space at large. Crypto Markets Displaying Contrarian Sentiment A factor key to the current market uncertainty is a change in sentiment from bullish to bearish. When sentiment shifts in either direction very quickly, it can be a good indicator of where the market might be heading next. The way the market usually works is that prices move opposite of what the crowd seems to be expecting. In the case of Bitcoin, this recent shift to a more bearish crowd sentiment might actually set things up for another rally. One effective way to gauge market sentiment is to track the ratio of positive to negative social media mentions of cryptocurrencies. When this is done, a consistent slight bullish bias can be seen across platforms whenever crypto discussions heat up online. But this has been met with an equally strong bearish counterbalance. The fear and greed balance in the cryptocurrency market is crucial to understand, and what we know right now suggests it may not be tipping anywhere anytime soon. And that’s relevant because fear and greed is what we know drives the price of Bitcoin. Keeping an eye on these trends in social media allows investors a glimpse into the general sentiment of the market and how it may change in the near future. If fear is still the dominant sentiment and its divergence from greed is widening, this may be a signal that Bitcoin’s price is about to rise again—contrary to most traders’ expectations—because anytime fear is the dominant sentiment, that means we are at a market bottom. Institutional Inflows Highlight Continued Interest in Bitcoin Even with the recent pushback from Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency enjoys strong interest from institutional investors. On May 15, spot Bitcoin ETFs enjoyed a solid total net inflow of $115 million. That is obviously a sign that institutional interest remains strong, even with Bitcoin price movement having slowed somewhat, at least temporarily. It’s also interesting to note that of all the Bitcoin ETFs in the space, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) from BlackRock was the only one to record any sort of net inflow. On May 15 (ET), spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a total net inflow of $115 million, with BlackRock’s IBIT being the only ETF to record a net inflow. Spot Ethereum ETFs experienced a total net outflow of $39.7859 million, with BlackRock’s ETHA being the only one to post a net inflow.… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 16, 2025 What is particularly remarkable about the inflow into Bitcoin ETFs is that it is now the diaspora of traditional financial markets embracing cryptocurrencies and holding them in as many forms as the crypto product factories can dream up. While the European asset manager 21Shares and other players (like ProShare) were already issuing Bitcoin ETFs, the use of such vehicles is now Synonymous with the kind of hard-asset exposure that even Grayscale can’t quite offer, for now, to investors. Even BlackRock now gets you into Bitcoin as simply as can be done, with a fund whose inflows reflect the nearly miraculous mainstreaming of crypto. These institutional investments are critical to Bitcoin’s long-term growth. They supply much-needed liquidity and, just as importantly, serve as a validation for the asset’s adoption into the mainstream. While it might be stated that our current retail atmosphere hardly is a safe one, it seems clear that our institutions feel quite comfortable putting their money into Bitcoin. What’s Next for Bitcoin? Is a Rally Imminent? At present, the Bitcoin market appears to be suffering a temporary setback, but it does not currently signal a prolonged downturn. In recent days, Bitcoin has been stuck in what is between $104K to $105K, but this period is not without some increased trading-related fear. Fear is something we have to pay close attention to. When traders are this fearful and pessimistic, it very often means that what we are actually witnessing is a contrarian opportunity. When we are this fearful and pessimistic, what is actually happening is markets are setting themselves up to move in the opposite direction, which here seems to mean a potential bullish environment. Having deep-pocketed institutional investors pouring money into Bitcoin ETFs and continued mentions on social media showing a barely concealed bullish bias, it looks like the stage might be set for a Bitcoin rally sometime soon. It’s probably a good idea for traders and investors to monitor these developments closely. Based on the past, the way that crypto markets operate is quite clear. And now, that clarity is generating fear. With Bitcoin as the new Fear Index, we see the cryptocurrency space maturing before our eyes. With institutional investment in the Bitcoin Foundation, the next big patient play is sure to favor the upside. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

44721781,https://nulltx.com/?p=149702,1747458866,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Solana DEX Volumes Surge as Memecoin Trading Continues to Dominate,https://nulltx.com/solana-dex-volumes-surge-as-memecoin-trading-continues-to-dominate/,"Solana has a DEX , and in 2025 it started showing signs of recovery, with trading volume increasing to upwards of $6 billion per day in total volume traded. Of that, nearly $4 billion are in memecoins, which have long been a dominant color in the Solana ecosystem. Even with unending doubts about the staying power of memecoin trading, this type of trading has shown itself to be quite sturdy, adapting to—and sometimes leading—new trends and narratives. From late 2023 to early 2024, trades involving memecoins have provided between 40% and 70% of the total trading volume found on Solana DEXs. This kind of trading is far from the total collapse we seemed set for in 2022 and at the beginning of 2023, with trades found in Solana memecoins likely as safe as any trades found on centralized exchanges. Memecoins Drive DEX Growth, with PumpDotFun Leading the Charge Solana DEX volumes are experiencing a resurgence, and that revival is linked closely to trading “ memecoins .” A new player in this realm is @pumpdotfun, which seems to have quickly inflated to near the top of the Solana DEX leaderboard, commanding over 20% of DEX volume in recent weeks. @pumpdotfun features a unique bonding curve and automated market maker (AMM) functionality that have made it popular with users. This growth has not come without consequences, though, as it has seemingly and at least to some extent displaced @RaydiumProtocol in the DEX trading mix. Previously, Raydium held a commanding percentage of the Solana DEX market, accounting for as much as 60% of the total DEX volume. But the memecoin trading movement—taking place on platforms such as PumpDotFun—has blasted off and is now wrecking what’s left of the Solana DEX ecosystem. Raydium is not even mentioned as a key player in the latest segment of the Solana DEX ecosystem on DeFi Lama. Tokens like those traded on PumpDotFun represent an enduring sector on Solana: the memecoin. These offshoots of the meme economy reach obscene heights, and on Solana (as elsewhere), they are propped up by a few factors. High volatility lends them an aura of potential profitability, which attracts traders. Still, they maintain a decent amount of user engagement—because, at the end of the day, what are these tokens but a joke? A joke waiting to be told, retold, and riffed on, the surface reason why the value of these tokens might go up. What are trading memes if not a punchline? New Launchpads and Apps Stir the Market, Shifting Memecoin Market Share Though PumpDotFun has been the long-standing leader, newer projects and platforms are starting to make a big splash in Solana’s DEX landscape. AxiomExchange’s recent rise has been key to the overall increase in app activity across Solana, contributing 5-10% of total trading volume and about 15% of memecoin trading volume. This is a shift that shows the Solana ecosystem is becoming more diversified and that users are exploring a new set of applications and exchange platforms. Additionally, the excitement around memecoin projects and the appearance of new launchpads have turned up the competitive intensity. One notable instance comes from @RaydiumProtocol’s LaunchLab, which has been riding the coattails of @bonk_fun, a top-shelf memecoin that has driven attention and traffic to the platform. This instance illustrates the new-wave project fishing for momentum using the Solana DEX infrastructure to create a buzz around itself. Maybe the most amazing change has occurred with @MeteoraAG, whose market share has rocketed upward thanks to the rising enthusiasm around @believeapp. The roll-out of Believe has sparked fresh interest in the Solana memecoin scene, as the platform really leans into the Internet Capital Markets story. Over just a couple days, Meteora’s market share has blasted up to 25%, while PumpDotFun has seen a slight dip, moving from the mid-30s down to around 20%. 1/ Solana DEX volumes have recovered to mid-February levels, with daily total volumes crossing $6B and memecoin volumes back at nearly $4B. Despite constant remarks about the supposed ephemerality of memecoin trading, the sector has continuously adapted to new narratives. pic.twitter.com/y96FUSvj0E — defi_kay_ (@defi_kay_) May 15, 2025 This transformation highlights the increasing impact of new launchpads and applications within the Solana ecosystem, which are competing with long-established platforms like PumpDotFun. The latest narratives that are gathering momentum and the innovative projects that are in the vanguard of user attention mean that the market dynamics are changing with dizzying speed and that the Solana DEX sector retains a highly competitive and fluid character. Looking Ahead: A Competitive Landscape for Solana DEXs The reestablishment of volumes on Solana’s DEX to levels not seen since mid-February—thanks to the continuing memecoin craze—gives me hope that the Solana ecosystem can stage a comeback. Unlike at some other cryptocurrency exchanges, though, the Solid DEFI team reports relatively few problems with their products. Even the new apps coming onboard, like PumpDotFun, AxiomExchange, and Meteora, don’t seem to be having the kind of negative impact that—along with a decentralized governance proposal—that Raydium had on the market. So, it’s all good, right? Right. Especially, the rise of PumpDotFun has made it a key player in the memecoin sector, but now its dominance is being challenged by new launchpads and apps that are becoming influential. The competition between platforms like Raydium, Meteora, and AxiomExchange shows the development of Solana’s DEX ecosystem and suggests there are probably soon-to-be-released projects that are maintaining this ecosystem’s momentum. While the Solana decentralized exchange (DEX) sector is growing, it looks like one part of its ecosystem is maturing fast. Solana’s memecoins are doing an awful lot of heavy lifting for the blockchain’s DEX sector. Whether they are a passing fad or not, the memecoins seem to be here to stay for a while, and that can’t be anything but good for the Solana decentralized finance (DeFi) © space.

While Mizrachi didn’t share details about his discussions with Keiser and Herbert, the timing of the post came 11 days before the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, where Mizrachi is scheduled to speak. Source: Mayer Mizrachi The creation of a Bitcoin reserve in Panama City would follow a recently approved measure permitting the use of crypto for public payments, including taxes, fines and municipal fees. Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ether ( ETH ), Tether ( USDT ) and USDC ( USDC ) will be accepted once the crypto-to-fiat payment rails are established, Mizrachi said at the time. To push for a Bitcoin reserve at the federal level, Mizrachi would need to collaborate with Panama’s National Assembly to craft legislation. There’s no evidence to suggest that he has taken such measures. Mizrachi’s post follows the recent enactments of two Bitcoin reserve bills in the US states of Arizona and New Hampshire. Ukraine is also reportedly inching closer toward adopting Bitcoin as a national reserve asset, local media reported earlier in the month. Mizrachi, Keiser and Herbert discussed Bitcoin mining, education A post from Keiser suggests the trio spoke about how Panama and El Salvador can leverage renewable energy to bolster their Bitcoin mining operations. “Bitcoin is transforming Central America. El Salvador’s geothermal & Panama’s hydro-electric will power the Bitcoin revolution.” Herbert also noted that Panama City will integrate El Salvador’s “What is Money?” financial literacy textbook into its online library system.

Just today, Abraxas swung for the fences and acquired 67.6K ETH for about $175 million on Binance. That purchase brought its total for the recent stretch—what we now know to be a very bullish accumulation phase that started on May 7—to 278,639 ETH worth around $724 million. This is a not-so-quiet push into Ethereum from a firm that we’ve now got on our watchlist. Abraxas Capital is slowly becoming Microstrategy for Ethereum. Just today, it bought 67.6K ETH worth $175 million on Binance. Since May 7th, Abraxas Capital has bought a total of 278,639 ETH worth $724 million. This is their strategy for buying more ETH • Buy ETH on… pic.twitter.com/ulysUVLmUf — Ito Shimotsuma (@ItoShimotsuma) May 16, 2025 By making these impressive acquisitions, Abraxas Capital has emerged as a key player in Ethereum’s future. Moreover, it has doubled down on its belief that the cryptocurrency has long-term value. This high-stakes strategy has many in the crypto community talking and wondering: Is Abraxas Capital becoming the “MicroStrategy of Ethereum”? The Strategy Behind Abraxas Capital’s Ethereum Purchases Abraxas Capital’s method of accumulating Ethereum is a unique and bold one, signaling their belief that Ethereum’s value will continue to rise. Their strategy revolves around a cycle of buying ETH, leveraging it on decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, and then using the borrowed funds to buy even more ETH. Here’s how the process works: 1. Acquiring ETH on Exchanges: Abraxas Capital starts off by acquiring Ethereum on centralized exchanges such as Binance. This method enables the firm to rapidly build up substantial amounts of ETH at rates that are very competitive. 2. Lending on AAVE: After buying ETH, Abraxas Capital lends the tokens on AAVE, a decentralized lending platform. This allows the firm to earn interest on its holdings while, at the same time, borrowing stablecoins like USDT (Tether). 3. Purchasing Additional ETH with USDT from the Lending Protocol: The USDT that was lent from the previous step is used to buy even more ETH. By using borrowed funds to make purchases, Abraxas Capital is increasing not just the quantity of ETH in its possession but also, and perhaps more importantly, the institution’s exposure to the asset. By consistently utilizing this strategy, Abraxas Capital seeks to amass a substantial holding in Ethereum over time. This tactic is akin to that of MicroStrategy in the Bitcoin arena, where it used debt to fund its Bitcoin buys and secure a commanding position in the asset. The Present Market and Ethereum ETF Developments Despite BlackRock’s ETH ETF being the only fund with net inflows, current Ethereum sentiment & net outflows don’t seem super bullish. While Abraxas Capital has been making waves in the Ethereum market, the overall Ethereum market sentiment is not so chill right now. On May 15, the total amount pulled out of Ethereum ETFs totaled nearly $40 million (specifically, $39.7859 million). That’s a lot of dosh to be pulling out of not just one fund but several. And while it’s always a bit concerning for a market when the entities in it being funded are experiencing withdrawals, this seems particularly worrisome given that institutional investors are behind ETF products. The outflows from Ethereum ETFs occur when many are still assessing the long-term outlook for the asset. Although traditional finance (TradFi) and institutional investors have begun to warm to Ethereum through ETFs, there still appears to be a healthy sense of caution, due to not only ongoing market volatility but also a number of still-open regulatory questions. All that said, the apparent growth of BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF suggests that institutional interest in Ethereum remains fairly strong, with many investors seeing it as a vehicle with which to access a still-nascent, potentially rapidly growing Ethereum ecosystem. On May 15 (ET), spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a total net inflow of $115 million, with BlackRock’s IBIT being the only ETF to record a net inflow. Spot Ethereum ETFs experienced a total net outflow of $39.7859 million, with BlackRock’s ETHA being the only one to post a net inflow.… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 16, 2025 The aggressive manner in which Abraxas Capital has been gathering ETH could well reflect an ample amount of confidence in Ethereum’s future as a lucrative investment vehicle. Abraxas is virtually swimming against the current when it comes to investor sentiment. While traditional markets show a profusion of signals that range from mildly optimistic to decidedly pessimistic, this investment firm is funneling huge sums into Ethereum. Publicly available information suggests that over 1.1 million ETH have been accumulated, worth some $2.8 billion today. By any definition, that’s a substantial investment. A Growing Influence in Ethereum’s Future While Abraxas Capital is heftily loading up on Ethereum (ETH), the firm is starting to make a name for itself as a serious player in the Ethereum ecosystem. In just the latest week and change, Abraxas has now plopped down roughly $724 million on a number of purchases of ETH, and this most recent acquisition seems more pronounced, heavier, than anything we’ve quite seen yet in terms of a firm coming into Ethereum and making a big statement. This is quite impactful, indeed. But why would its be quite impactful? What sort of might an ETH acquisition of this size have on the market? Abraxas Capital’s strategy of participating in decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms to leverage its substantial Ethereum holdings signals something even bolder: a deeper integration with the systems of decentralized finance. When the firm participates in DeFi lending, it is doing much more than attempting to increase exposure to Ethereum as a result of a bullish view on the cryptocurrency. Abraxas Capital is reinforcing, with its dollars and decision-making, the ecosystem that Ethereum powers. Abraxas Capital’s approach is similar to that of MicroStrategy in the Bitcoin market, where the company has piled up a huge Bitcoin reserve by leveraging its balance sheet. This strategy has made MicroStrategy a key player in the Bitcoin space, and it might well be that Abraxas Capital similarly becomes a significant player in the Ethereum ecosystem. Abraxas Capital’s commitment to the network could play a compelling role in driving future growth and adoption as Ethereum continues to expand and evolve. The firm’s aggressive investment strategy conveys a strong message of confidence in Ethereum’s long-term value. And its presence might encourage other institutional investors to adopt a similar playbook. To conclude, the actions and strategy of Abraxas Capital serve as a reminder of the institutional interest in Ethereum. This asset may be shaping up to have a very bright future, possibly taking EIP-1559 and the upcoming Ethereum Merge as two main catalysts adhering to that theory. Should more firms follow the lead of Abraxas Capital and show interest in Ethereum, the very practicality of the platform might see some sort of mainstream adoption.

Recent hacks, including a $1.4 billion breach at Bybit , highlight growing threats, with $2.2 billion stolen in 2024 alone. Coinbase is now battling a lawsuit over alleged data lapses and has refused to pay a $20 million ransom, instead offering the same amount as a bounty. While Coinbase fell victim to this social engineering attack, Binance and Kraken managed to stop similar attempts before any damage was done. A new Bloomberg report reveals how these exchanges stayed a step ahead. What Happened at Coinbase? Coinbase revealed in a recent SEC filing that hackers tricked some offshore customer service agents into giving access to certain user data and account records. The attackers reportedly offered bribes to these employees. Although no passwords, private keys, or user funds were stolen, the breach is expected to cost Coinbase up to $400 million . This includes reimbursements and cleanup efforts. To track down those behind the attack, Coinbase is even offering a $20 million reward. Same Tactics Used on Binance and Kraken According to Bloomberg, Binance and Kraken were targeted by the same kind of phishing scheme. Hackers tried to reach out to customer service agents via Telegram and asked for sensitive information like account balances and home addresses. But unlike Coinbase, these two exchanges didn’t suffer any data leaks. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : U.S.-Registered Xinbi Guarantee Linked to $8.4 Billion in Illegal Activity , How Binance and Kraken Stayed Safe Thanks to strong internal security systems, Binance and Kraken were able to detect the suspicious activity early. Their AI tools flagged the phishing attempts before any employee gave up information. This quick response helped protect users and avoid any data loss. Still a Wake-Up Call for Crypto Platforms Even though Binance and Kraken came out safe, the incident is a reminder of how serious social engineering threats have become. Hackers are no longer just targeting systems, they’re targeting people. Exchanges must stay alert, especially when it comes to third-party service providers. This latest string of phishing attacks shows that the crypto industry still has work to do in protecting users. While Coinbase deals with the aftermath, Binance and Kraken’s strong defense sets a good example for others to follow. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

While Ethereum once ruled the roost, new contenders like BNB Chain, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base are making noticeable gains. Each chain seems to have enjoyed its own distinct set of growth spurts, periods of stagnation, and brush with market leadership, giving us a good picture of an evolving DeFi and crypto ecosystem. In this environment that’s changing with great rapidity, Ethereum remains in many ways a commanding presence in the market, even if it’s lost a little bit of dominance. Meanwhile, chains like BNB Chain and Base have emerged to challenge Ethereum in the embedded swap space, to some degree. Here’s a closer look at how each of these chains is performing in that market. Ethereum: From Dominance to a Resilient Core Player For a long time, the DeFi ecosystem has hinged on Ethereum. DeFi accounted for nearly 100% of all the sockets in Ethereum until March 2021, but that was never a totally comfortable situation. For one thing, Ethereum is expensive. Those sockets don’t come cheap, and the actual interface implementations are rarely simple or straightforward. Gas fees on Ethereum can change dramatically from hour to hour or even minute to minute, making it a really bad time to be doing a swap when you’ll be basically swapping in order to pay for the swap. Notably, even though its share of the market has decreased to about 20%, Ethereum is still a key player when it comes to trading and settlement inside the network. Its trading volume hit a peak of $10 billion in 2021, but by 2023 it had dropped down to only $200 million weekly. Still, Ethereum is rallying again in 2025, with its trading volume recovering to $2 billion per week. All this adds up to about a 40% share of all trading activity happening inside the network right now. BNB Chain: Unstoppable Growth with a Surge in Market Share The last few years have been quite consistent and impressive for BNB Chain, as they have brought consistent and impressive growth. In 2021, BNB Chain was doing solidly, with an impressive swap count of 2 million weekly swaps. By 2025, however, we had surged to an impressive 15 million swaps per week on BNB Chain. When audits are included, we had exceeded 15 million weekly swaps in 2025. This growth has also led to considerable fluctuations in our market share. In 2021 and 2022, BNB Chain’s market share of embedded swaps reached its zenith at 70% , clearly in the commanding position of this emerging space. Although this share dipped slightly in 2023, its recovery since that year has been remarkable; by 2025, it had swelled to an even better-than-before share of greater than 60%. BNB Chain’s overall share of trading volume, though, has remained relatively modest; what can we ascribe its absence from the top of that leaderboard to? This trajectory—bumping past the Peg and aha moment and headed for the Pragma Si milestone—positions BNB Chain as a legit contender in the EVM space. Its rise to this moment in time, backed by increasing average daily users and total value locked in, suggests that decentralized finance investors are leaning heavily toward this chain. Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base: Shifting Dynamics Among Emerging Players Arbitrum and Optimism have also played important parts in the growth of decentralized finance, though they have seen different levels of success. Arbitrum, a top DeFi chain, seized 20% of swap share in early 2023, with its peak weekly volume hitting $600 million in April 2024. Although its swap count has since dropped to somewhere between 500,000 and 1 million weekly swaps, Arbitrum has remained in the top three for capital inflow in the DeFi space. On the contrary, swap shares have felt the direct impact of optimism to a much lesser degree. A modest number of 10,000 weekly swaps in 2022 had a more direct impact on Impressions, but from there, the swaps only grew in count. By April of 2025, that figure had swelled to a number in and around 70,000. Even at those much-improved counts, the influence of this layer on the swap market is still, at best, minimal. The peak (of either Impressions or swaps) reaches only a rounding-error number of $50 million Paxos dollars. To speak of Base is to speak of one of the most promising emerging chains. Having launched only in 2024, Base has already made a splash, with a weekly swaps count that reached 4.5 million by April 2025. Those numbers position Base at the center of the activity in the EVM space—that is, among chains compatible with Ethereum’s virtual machine—and with what’s happening on Ethereum itself, accounting for approximately 20% of total swap counts and from 10-25% of total trading volumes. Base has itself become a playground for swaps, and what’s driving those swaps is largely the activity surrounding memecoins, asset tokenization, and new, innovative DeFi-CeFi lending integrations, including the integration between Base and the Coinbase-Morpho protocol. So if there’s anything that’s a true breakout development in the Ethereum space in 2025, it’s gotta be Base. Conclusion: A Fragmented Yet Thriving Ecosystem The swap trends seen across Ethereum and other EVM Chains are a clear indicator of how fast the blockchain and DeFi markets are moving at the moment. Even though it has shown a steady decline in its market share, Ethereum is still a top contender in this space. Meanwhile, BNB Chain has been showing an impressive and steady growth trajectory, with its own ecosystem expanding very nicely. At the same time, newer players in this segment—like Base, for instance—are catching up pretty quickly, while Arbitrum and Optimism are also doing their part to maintain this diverse market landscape. The blockchain arena keeps moving forward. Intense competition now exists among EVM chains. New chains are capturing market share—sometimes through the innovative solutions they offer. In this environment, Ethereum itself is under challenge, both from new competitors and from new technological developments in its own ecosystem. If this competition is happening at the level of chains, what about at the level of Layer 2s? Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

In the AI Agent market overall, the last 24 hours have seen a slight stabilization at a valuation of $10.8 billion, which reflects a dip of about 0.45%. But even with that dip, mindshare for the Virtuals ecosystem has seen a substantial uptick—it reached a record 39.41%. That uptick memorializes a noteworthy performance divergence across the Virtuals space. Emerging projects and tokens are seeing a ton of action. By contrast, the larger, more established tokens aren’t really going much of anywhere. They’re effectively treading water. The ongoing rotation in the market has seen sizable advances in smaller-cap projects, with tokens like RWAI, POLY, SQDGN, AURA, and BIOS making headway with double-digit percentage gains. But the retracement we’ve seen in the overall market, especially within the flagship $VIRTUAL token—which has declined by nearly 5% in the last 24 hours—is a harbinger of just how volatile the world of AI and crypto is these days. AI Agent Sector Maintains Stability Despite Capital Rotation The AI Agent sector is a key part of the Virtuals ecosystem and hasn’t seen much movement in the past 24 hours; it’s still holding at a $10.8 billion valuation, which pretty much amounts to a 0.45% loss—nothing to panic about. Holders of AI Agents should maintain their composure; this sector remains a relatively stable and resilient area of investment under the current market conditions. In this case, capital rotation pertains to the transfer of capital from larger-cap projects into tokens that are smaller and more speculative. This has caused some of the major tokens in the AI Agent market, like $VIRTUAL, to see a drop in their prices while smaller tokens have enjoyed some significant upward movement in their prices. As a result, the total market cap for the Virtuals ecosystem itself has dropped by 1.05% to about $2.27 billion. While this drop is evident, the mindshare expansion to 39.41% suggests that market participants are increasingly paying attention to Virtuals and the growth narrative adjacent to the ecosystem. Small Caps Surge as Major Tokens See Retracements While the larger market has taken some steps backward, the small-cap tokens inside the Virtuals ecosystem are enjoying a major upturn in fortunes. The names that stand out over the last 24 hours include RWAI, POLY, SQDGN, AURA, and BIOS, which have each bettered their previous all-time highs with growth numbers of between 22% and more than 41%. RWAI (@RWAIagent) is up a commanding 41.25%, a clear sign that investors are hot on the trail of AI-powered solutions with clear niches in the ecosystem. POLY (@polytraderAI), an AI trading bot protocol, seems to have captured the imagination of those looking for innovative decentralized trading systems, as its price is up 23.97%. SQDGN (@helloSQDGN) is also seeing a very impressive run, as its price is up 22.79%, and there’s clear interest in its unique setup. AURA (@AurraCloud) and BIOS (@BasisOS) are both up a solid 22%, and there’s very clear interest in the kinds of AI-focused virtual world projects they are running. Virtuals Daily Update | May 16th, 2025 Stay up to date on all news from the @virtuals_io ecosystem over the last 24 hours… pic.twitter.com/m12BQkdJN1 — Graeme (@gkisokay) May 16, 2025 These smaller-cap tokens are seeing a rise, which can be viewed as a shift in investor sentiment. Traders and investors seem to be diversifying and allocating funds into up-and-coming projects with high growth potential. Meanwhile, the larger tokens, like $VIRTUAL, have faced retracements. Those are attracting increasing attention for a healthy, active ecosystem of innovation. Virtuals Mindshare Soars Amidst Market Rotations The Virtuals ecosystem is seeing an incredibly rapid rise in recognition and engagement. It is now at an all-time high of 39.41%. In the past 24 hours, the rise was 5.12%. If recognition and engagement continue at even close to this rate, we are going to see some very nice things happening in the not-so-distant future. This upsurge in the attention given to Virtuals indicates that even though the main tokens are experiencing a retracement, people are paying a lot more attention and are a lot more engaged with the broader ecosystem of Virtuals. What used to be a few smaller projects out in the woods is now a lot brighter, and a lot more people are coming to play. Attention isn’t investment, and it sure as hell doesn’t guarantee any growth, but it is possible that the much-maligned “mindshare” could lead somewhere. Conclusion: A Mixed Landscape with Signs of Growth The Virtuals ecosystem continues to develop amidst a cocktail of pullbacks and advances that provide us with an up-to-date portrait of the current market dynamics. The AI Agent sector remains firm, displaying a $10.8 billion valuation level, and the momentum is holding here despite what seem like slight pullbacks. Meanwhile, small-cap tokens within the Virtuals ecosystem are experiencing massive surges within the last month that are signaling some kind of healthy appetite for innovation and new projects. Investors need to be conscious of the changing dynamics in the market as it continues to rotate. The ecosystem is attracting a lot of attention, which is a good sign and could be taken to mean that Virtuals is on its way to being a long-term growth story. The problem, though, is that as the bigger tokens—like $VIRTUAL—pull back, it raises a red flag about the overall health of the crypto sector. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Long-term holders are in a clear accumulation phase of Bitcoin. This movement, which started in late March 2025, reflects something that is happening in the market more broadly. Institutional players and traditional financial firms are starting to take on a bigger role in the story of Bitcoin. BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF has now surpassed its Strategy ETF in terms of how much Bitcoin it holds. Clearly, traditional finance (TradFi) and the world of cryptocurrencies are becoming ever more closely linked. Long-Term Holders Actively Accumulate Bitcoin The Long-Term Holders indicator shows that they’ve been actively accumulating $BTC since the end of March. The last notable accumulation by this group occurred between August and October 2024, when #Bitcoin was trading at local lows… pic.twitter.com/n85LcELr42 — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) May 15, 2025 The increasing presence of institutional capital in the crypto space brings with it three big changes: a fresh narrative about Bitcoin, a new market structure around this and other crypto assets, and, it must be said, an increased risk of centralization. In the midst of all this, it’s certainly easy, if not always accurate, to view the presence of Wall Street in the Bitcoin market as a big step toward the latter’s legitimization as a part of the financial system. Long-Term Holders Are Accumulating Bitcoin Again The Long-Term Holders indicator is a key metric for tracking the activity of Bitcoin’s most dedicated investors. It has recently revealed something interesting: since late March 2025, long-term holders of Bitcoin have been not just buying, but accumulating large amounts of the cryptocurrency. And this pattern of accumulation is now so pronounced that it merits talking about. So what has the Long-Term Holders indicator revealed about recent activity among this group of privileged Bitcoin holders? From August to October 2024, the price of Bitcoin reached a vital moment. Many market players were divided—some expected a significant rally, others, a breakdown. After the U.S. presidential election, in which Donald Trump emerged victorious, the price of Bitcoin shot upward, sending many into a bull market frenzy. What we see now with Bitcoin’s accumulation pattern is something entirely different from a market breakdown. This is a situation where long-term holders of Bitcoin signal to the rest of us that they now consider the price to be undervalued. And these signalers, in our more patient and volatile future, are much more likely to maintain the status quo. The increase in activity from long-term holders comes just as Bitcoin has gained a lot of respect from big institutions. There is clear interest in the asset from both retail and institutional investors, and their almost unanimous confidence in Bitcoin’s future is becoming pronounced. Shareholders in both camps are apparently quite content to not sell their Bitcoin even as the price lately has been pushed down. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Signals Institutional Dominance One of the most significant events in the Bitcoin market has been the growing dominance of BlackRock in Bitcoin ETF holdings. BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF recently passed its Strategy ETF in Bitcoin holdings, reaching an impressive amount of around $64.7 billion, compared to $59.1 billion in its Strategy ETF. BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF just surpassed Strategy in BTC holdings — now valued at ~$64.7B vs $59.1B Three key implications emerge: 1⃣ TradFi is taking over the Bitcoin narrative 2⃣ BTC market structure is shifting 3⃣ Centralization risk is growing Also today: Abu… pic.twitter.com/elf6NqXUrT — Followin (@followin_io) May 16, 2025 One of the biggest players of the traditional financial world, BlackRock, has long occupied a central role in financial markets and how they are shaped. Its involvement with Bitcoin clearly sends the signal that traditional finance is taking a much more pronounced role in this new asset class. BlackRock’s lot in life is to gather assets in as many ways as it can count. That it would consider Bitcoin a viable asset class for gathering assets is something that should not be lost on anyone. This milestone underscores the trend of institutional capital moving into Bitcoin via products like ETFs that are heavily regulated. These vehicles give traditional investors a means of getting Bitcoin exposure without having to directly buy and hold it. The ETF conversation, then, is really a Bitcoin conversation, and it’s a sign of the cryptocurrency’s increasing acceptance in mainstream finance. The Risks of Centralization and Shifting Market Dynamics Legitimizing Bitcoin by involving institutions in the cryptocurrency’s realm is all well and good, but is in-principle legitimization by the involvement of institutions not bad for the cryptocurrency’s long-standing, if not dodgy, image of a decentralization miracle? Indeed, as more big-money players and hooded figures from the world of finance storm into the Bitcoin castle, they grow, in something of a paradox, the castle’s image of a place under siege and its real image of decentralization—with the increasing rumblings in Street and public fears of summit, open-hijacking, and plummet-to-Earth potential for a Bitcoin that is centralized in the minds real-deal finance sees as achieving legitimacy, and thus great tolerability, to the go-go world of an offshore investment haven. A few big institutions that are players in the Bitcoin market possibly can, and probably do, create risks for the little retail investors who are buying Bitcoin. This is true especially if a controlling interest in a majority of Bitcoin is held not by individual investors (as would be the case in a truly decentralized system) but by large, institutional players (as might the very recent trend suggest). What happens when a small number of big institutions control a large enough piece of a supposedly decentralized pie? And what happens when those institutions wield enough money to influence the market without any real influence over what’s supposed to be a decentralized future for the Bitcoin system? This trend towards centralization is observable not just in the advent of Bitcoin ETFs but also in the increasing involvement of massive international institutional investors. For example, Mubadala, the sovereign wealth fund of Abu Dhabi, recently revealed that it has taken a position in BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, amassing around 8.727 million shares worth close to $410 million. This is a very strong signal that traditional institutions from all over are now entering the Bitcoin market through the ETF route and, by doing so, are embracing Bitcoin as a really mainstream kind of asset. Conclusion: A New Era for Bitcoin The recent activity in the Bitcoin market reflects a significant shift, with long-term investors accumulating Bitcoin and institutional players gaining increasing influence. While Bitcoin itself shows continued resilience and growth, the means by which it achieves those ends—and the market’s overall structure—are undergoing changes that could have lasting impacts on the precursors to its decentralization. With BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF now at the forefront, and global institutions like Mubadala indicating their commitment to Bitcoin, it’s clear that traditional finance is not just accepting Bitcoin as a legitimate asset but is also energetically moving to shape its future. This is undoubtedly a moment of fascinating possibilities—yet also potential risks, especially where centralization is concerned. As Bitcoin becomes ever more an asset governed by institutions, it’s something that we will all have to navigate. Bitcoin is growing in an increasingly solid global financial landscape, but its future role still seems quite uncertain. It might function more and more like a traditional asset, but it might also keep up its pretense of being a decentralized peer-to-peer currency. Or it might push up the walls of that pretend stage and suck in the peer-to-peer society that’s its only real customer. One thing is certain: Bitcoin’s story isn’t just the story of Bitcoin anymore.

44722102,https://nulltx.com/?p=149698,1747459617,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,FTX’s Costly Early Exits: A $7.6 Billion Missed Opportunity,https://nulltx.com/ftxs-costly-early-exits-a-7-6-billion-missed-opportunity/,"FTX , which was once a prominent player in the cryptocurrency sector, still shows signs of basic errors that have contributed to its collapse. One of the most apparent blunders was selling too soon its early-stage, high-potential partnership investments. Those decisions have likely set the exchange back to the tune of billions in unrealized gains (the crypto community is now left to wonder if these were really “partnership” decisions made under pressure or just plain dumb moves). Key FTX Restructuring Outcomes for Customers 1. FTX estate sold numerous investments for far less than their worth. 2. Potential upside missed by FTX = $7.6 billion. 3. Repaid to customers so far = $1.2 billion. 4. Amount to be repaid, stated by FTX, = $14.7 billion to $16.5 billion. Anysphere: A $200K Exit from a $9B Rocket One of the most missed notable opportunities for FTX was its early investment in Anysphere, the company behind Cursor AI. In 2022, Alameda, FTX’s trading firm, invested a modest $200K into Anysphere. At the time, it seemed a small gamble for a potentially big payoff. By April 2023, however, the estate of FTX sold the stake for the same amount—just $200K—seemingly writing off any future potential. By 2025, Anysphere had raised $900 million and had a valuation of a staggering $9 billion. FTX’s initial $200,000 investment would now be worth an estimated $500 million. And from that, you get this: 50x for Anysphere; 2.5x profit for FTX; and a missed opportunity on Anysphere’s first round of funding that had us recoup investors’ funds instead of bagging life-changing profits. Sui: A Missed $3.55 Billion from Mysten Labs A further notable instance of FTX’s exit strategy became evident in its interactions with Mysten Labs and the $SUI token. In 2022, FTX funneled a $101 million check into Mysten’s Series B funding round, obtaining both equity and around 890 million $SUI tokens as part of the arrangement. At the time, it appeared to be a solid investment, with these tokens set to capitalize on the burgeoning DeFi ecosystem. In April 2023, however, FTX’s estate sold off its whole position, for $96.2 million—a loss of $4.8 million compared to the price it paid for the tokens. By May 2025, $SUI was trading at about $4 a token. That surge in value turned FTX’s missed investment opportunity into something that could have plumped up its estate with an additional $3.55 billion. Who knows—maybe investors could have bought some really nice shelters for that kind of cash. Selling this position looks even more regrettable now, especially when you consider how much $SUI could keep going up if and when Mysten Labs really makes a name for itself in the blockchain space. Anthropic: $500M Bet Sold Too Soon The investment in Anthropic, the artificial intelligence company behind Claude AI, was perhaps the most painful loss for FTX. In 2021, FTX bought an 8% stake in the company for $500 million, banking on the promise of artificial intelligence to deliver outsized returns. By 2023, FTX’s estate was selling its stake in Anthropic—and doing so for a total of $1.33 billion. A year later, Anthropic has become super valuable, with its worth rocketing to an astounding $61.5 billion. If FTX had held on to its 8 percent piece of that worth, it would now be sitting on an asset worth an estimated $4.92 billion—an amount that is $3.59 billion more than what FTX realized from the sale of its Anthropic stake. Anthropic’s swift ascent, powered by the increasing allure of AI technologies, highlights FTX’s lost chance, particularly when you consider that Anthropic’s valuation keeps rising in lockstep with AI’s growing importance on the global tech and finance stage. FTX fumbled the bag. Three times over. Anysphere (Cursor AI) recently raised $900M, more than tripling its valuation. FTX had an early stake… and sold it for $200K. Today it’s worth ~$500M. That was just one of 3 early exits that cost them ~$7.6B. Here’s what happened pic.twitter.com/z13TtK7DZd — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) May 15, 2025 Conclusion: A Strategic Move Under Pressure or a Rushed Mistake? The trio of early exits—Anysphere, Sui, and Anthropic—calls to mind the many possibilities FTX could have realized had it just held on to its positions. The combined total of these three developments amounts to $7.64 billion, which, had it been realized during the period in which FTX was attempting to emerge from bankruptcy, could have done a lot to help boost creditor recoveries and significantly change the narrative regarding FTX’s image. Looking back, we can see that these weren’t just normal investment screw-ups. The quick sell-offs, mainly due to how much they could have earned, beg the question: were they An impulsive choice, made under pressure? Or were they nasty, strategic moves done to cover for the company’s obvious financial instability? Whatever the case, they were some of the most expensive mistakes in FTX’s short, wild history. As FTX progresses with its restructuring, these not-so-missed opportunities offer a cautionary tale about the high-risk, high-reward crypto world we’re in. Imagining—because that’s all we can do since FTX is in no position to say otherwise—what the outcome might have been had FTX held onto these assets makes for an equally unreal and ridiculously lucrative picture of crypto history.

44722183,https://nulltx.com/?p=149697,1747459787,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Mantle and Sui Gain Ground in Stablecoin Transfer Size as Ethereum, Tron Dominate in Usage",https://nulltx.com/mantle-and-sui-gain-ground-in-stablecoin-transfer-size-as-ethereum-tron-dominate-in-usage/,"The stablecoin transaction world is moving quickly, and new data offers a surprising look at how various blockchain networks are being employed to transfer value. Notably, while Ethereum and Tron continue to fulfill the roles of primary network and infrastructure providers, newer entities such as Mantle and Sui are quickly distinguishing themselves, especially when average stablecoin transaction sizes are considered. Stablecoin adoption keeps on expanding, recently reported statistics from CrytoRank and SentoraHQ state. However, while each network is clearly making strides, the CryptoRank and SentoraHQ reports highlight that these networks are doing so in different ways. Some show more strength in transaction volume. Others show more strength in transfer size. Still, others show strength in user base, which in this case is represented by the number of user addresses. Ethereum Leads in Transfer Size, Base and Tron in Pursuit Ethereum remains the leader in terms of the average stablecoin transfer size. The network logs a stunning average of $68,000 per transaction, which places it heads and shoulders above the other networks in this regard. That figure suggests that Ethereum is still very much the layer-1 network of choice for high-value users, institutions, and DeFi protocols. Following closely behind is Base, a Layer 2 solution developed by Coinbase. It has managed to secure a strong place in the market with an average transaction size of $20,000, which is quite incredible for a relatively new solution. Tron, which is best known for its ultra-low transaction fees and efficiency, ranks next with an average of $8,900 in stablecoin transfers. Mantle and Sui lead in stablecoins transaction size Ethereum firmly holds the lead with an average stablecoin transaction size of $68K. @base ($20K) and @trondao ($8.9K) also rank among the top performers. Interestingly, @Mantle_Official ($6.8K) and @SuiNetwork ($5.8K) have… pic.twitter.com/o6XEiqCLnA — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) May 15, 2025 Nonetheless, what stands out most in the latest report is the emergence of Mantle and Sui, two blockchain networks that have quietly eclipsed more established players like Optimism and Arbitrum when it comes to average transaction size. Mantle registers $6,800, while Sui comes in close at $5,800—both of which surpass several other well-known Layer 2 and alternative Layer 1 networks. Mantle and Sui Outpace Optimism and Arbitrum in Transfer Volume per Transaction Mantle and Sui have only recently stepped into the limelight, but their performance is impressive. Both networks now have a steadily upward trend in average transaction size, which is a clear indicator that users feel more and more comfortable handling larger sums on the platforms. Mantle and Sui might be succeeding because they both have efficient transaction throughput, competitive gas fees, and growing developer ecosystems. But what’s really going on? Mantle and Sui are signaling a user behavior shift. They are by no means the first to signal something like this, but they are the first in a while to kind of plow ahead of Optimism and Arbitrum, which were once the prime competitors in this space and were long considered very solid parts of Ethereum’s Layer 2 scaling strategy. Users seem more and more willing to try out alternative chains that do, in fact, offer similar kinds of benefits to what those Layer 2 parts were offering. Segueing into another part of the user behavior shift, though, is that users really don’t seem to care too much, or aren’t concerned at all, about what they might have to do to get to those alternative chains. The presence of decentralized finance platforms and their high-yield protocols could be leading to development of larger transaction volumes from active traders and institutions across both networks. Whether this influx of cash is sustainable or merely a flash in the pan remains to be seen. Tron Dominates USDT Adoption with Unmatched Volume and User Base While Ethereum may lead in value per transaction, Tron continues to be the dominant network in terms of total USDT volume and user adoption. According to SentoraHQ, Tron processed a staggering $623.9 billion in stablecoin volume over the past 30 days. This is a testament to its role as the preferred network for USDT transactions, particularly in regions where low fees are critical. Tron is the most widely used network for USDT, processing $623.9 Billion in volume in the past 30 days. And with over 57 million USDT addresses on TRON, it accounts for more than 3 quarters of all USDT addresses. https://t.co/PquYZkmebs pic.twitter.com/vLNNckGxMn — Sentora (previously IntoTheBlock) (@SentoraHQ) May 16, 2025 In addition, Tron accommodates more than 57 million USDT addresses, which makes up over 75% of all active USDT addresses in the world. This colossal user base illustrates Tron’s exceptional standing as a network that’s friendly to retail transactions. More than any other network, Tron is a place where everyday payments, cross-border transactions, and peer-to-peer transfers—especially the kinds of transactions that developing markets carry out—take place. The efficiency, high throughput, and minimal fees of Tron have made it the choice for speed and cost-effectiveness in the movement of stablecoins—especially in transactions outside the traditional banking system. Conclusion The stablecoin environment keeps diversifying, with each blockchain network claiming its own space. Ethereum is still the best for value transfers, while Tron can’t be touched for volume and adoption. Yet those newer networks, like Mantle and Sui, are quickly coming into their own with competitive transaction sizes. This trend underscores an increasingly fragmented—and specialized—blockchain ecosystem. Users and developers pick platforms that suit their specific needs, be it scalability, transaction costs, or yield. In this fast-moving environment, watching the emerging players may give us hints about the next big winners in stablecoin infrastructure. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Some analysts suggest that new highs are bound to come if the token holds above a crucial level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Next Leg Up Loading? Analyst Says BTC Could Trade Sideways For Two Weeks Dogwifhat Reclaims $1.00 Over the past month, dogwifhat has seen a massive 190% surge, climbing back to the $1.00 barrier. The memecoin has been in a downtrend since hitting its Q4 2024 high of $4.19 in November, retracing over 92% in five months. After the TRUMP memecoin and LIBRA token controversial launches, the sector faced market exhaustion, with most memecoins struggling during the Q1 2025 retraces. As a result, WIF lost the $1.00 mark for the first time in a year. Amid last month’s pullbacks, dogwifhat hit a 14-month low of $0.32 before the crypto market recovery started, but jumped to the $0.60 support at the end of April. Since then, WIF has soared over 70%, reclaiming the key $1.00 resistance on Monday. This week, the memecoin has hovered between the $1.00-$1.20 price range after hitting a three-month high of $1.32 four days ago. Additionally, it retested the recently reclaimed level as support after bouncing from the $0.95 level on Thursday. Market watcher Rose Premium shared a technical outlook for the cryptocurrency, noting a bullish structure after its recent performance. The trader explained that dogwifhat shows “a classic bullish structure after rebounding from the Fibo Zone,” between the $0.95-$0.98 range. Based on this, WIF’s trend continuation is likely if the memecoin holds the $1.00 level as support. This could propel the token toward an initial target of $1.15, before reclaiming the $1.26 level and finally reclaiming the $1.37 mark. WIF Breakout Eyes $1.50 Trader Coinvo suggested that WIF’s “classic break and re-test pattern” is “guaranteed” to send the memecoin’s price in a parabolic rally. Similarly, analyst Carl Runefelt from The Moon Show affirmed that dogwifhat is “potentially ready to continue its rally to new highs.” Per the chart, WIF has been in a symmetrical triangle pattern over the past week, with price breaking out of the upper boundary after surging above the $1.05 level. According to the formation, the cryptocurrency targets $1.50 if the breakout is confirmed. This level has been a crucial horizontal level, serving as a key bounce area during the 2024 retraces, and could propel dogwifhat to higher targets if reclaimed.

The memecoin broke out of the 3-day pattern after today’s bounce, breaking out of the upper boundary after reclaiming the $1.03 mark. The analyst stated that WIF could target the $1.49 resistance area if it holds its current levels and the entire market “goes for another leg up from here.” As of this writing, dogwifhat trades at $0.14, a 1.8% increase in the daily timeframe.

44722266,https://nulltx.com/?p=149696,1747459954,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Nexpace (NXPC) Gains Momentum After Major Exchange Listings and Whale Activity,https://nulltx.com/nexpace-nxpc-gains-momentum-after-major-exchange-listings-and-whale-activity/,"In the rapidly changing world of cryptocurrency, there are few tokens that have captured investor attention like Nexpace ($NXPC) recently. This newly launched altcoin is making waves following its listings on several top-tier exchanges, including Binance, KuCoin, CoinEx, and XT.COM. And with aggressive marketing, serious community engagement, and high-yield staking incentives, NXPC has quickly become the digital asset that everyone seems to be talking about. The increasing excitement over Nexpace is not merely a function of promotion. It is based on serious, real activity happening on the chain. That’s clear when you look at the trading volume and the largeholder (or whale) moves that have been made recently. One such move has brought home just how profitable and how volatile this fast-rising altcoin can be. NXPC Sees Explosive Debut Across Major Platforms NXPC owes much of its recent acceleration to a coming-together of lucky factors and a smart rollout strategy. NEXE is in the process of lining up listings on several of the world’s largest cryptocurrency trading platforms, among them Binance and KuCoin. Listing on these platforms has lit a fire under NXPC trading, making the new token visible and liquid in and to the broad trading company geographic community of cryptocurrency traders. In addition to its direct exposure through exchange listings, Nexpace has been working to establish a presence in the crypto community by way of several high-profile community-building events. There have been airdrops and token giveaway campaigns, and those are at least somewhat par for the course with crypto community events at this point. But there’s also been a series of eye-catching events that have offered up some high-stakes trading for Nexpace derivatives, not to mention a series of very attractive APY offers that have been getting the attention of liquidity providers and yield farmers. Another huge factor in NXPC’s ascendance has been community engagement. The project has built a massive, and in some ways, unique user base, with who it interacts directly on daily basis through its Telegram and Twitter channels. The heavy use of these platforms is not something unusual for a blockchain project, of course; lots of them do the same. What sets NXPC apart is the kind of activity it holds on these channels, and the kind of community base it has built. Whale Scores Big But Misses the Top An exemplary case of the volatility and upside potential of NXPC occurred when a crypto whale turned that situation into a million-dollar profit. Using blockchain data, we know the approximate timing of the investment made. In total, 1.136 million NXPC tokens were bought at a price of $1.25 each. That amounts to around $1.42 million invested. Briefly after the whale made its entrance into the market, NXPC got a huge price push, hitting a high of $3.80 within a single day. Had the whale sold at the peak, the unrealized profit would have been almost $2.9 million . However, the investor held onto the tokens, probably looking for a better sell signal or avoiding slippage on such a large sell-off. Approximately two hours ago, the whale finally sold the whole NXPC holding—around $3.02 million worth—to Binance at an average sell price of $2.66. Now, this sale came at the end of a notable retracement from the day’s high, but still, our not-so-friendly whale walked away with a solid $1.6 million profit. This isn’t just a story about how to sell tokens quickly. The unpredictability of new token markets and the risks of trading in them makes this tale noteworthy. Market Reaction and Outlook Listing NXPC rapidly on numerous exchanges, together with the activity of market whales and some well-coordinated promotional events, has created the conditions for a stock that is both highly volatile and highly interesting. As an increasing number of retail traders and even some institutional players become aware of NXPC and what it is, this stock is liable to continue making large upward or downward price moves, with even larger trading volume accompanying those price moves. With that being said, analysts are cautious and believe that the token\u2019s future performance will be dependent on more than just what folks are throwing into it and more on what is actually happening with the token deep in its codebase and with its development team. \u201cIts link to the MapleStory Universe could be a game-changer if the team follows through with integrations or partnerships in the gaming and metaverse space,\u201d an analyst said. \u201cHowever, without clear use cases and sustained utility, tokens like NXPC often struggle to maintain long-term value after initial hype fades. As of now, Nexpace remains among the most monitored altcoins in the sector, with traders paying close attention to its exchange inflows, the action of its price, and any announcements made related to the project itself. Whether this momentum translates into a sustainable, long-term success or shrinks to nothing as just another brief pump remains to be seen. In any case, NXPC’s debut is another reminder of how quickly fortunes can be made—and unmade—in the crypto space. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

44722311,https://nulltx.com/?p=149695,1747460066,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Trump-linked DeFi Project WLFI Buys $3.6M in EOS, Fueling 10% Price Surge",https://nulltx.com/trump-linked-defi-project-wlfi-buys-3-6m-in-eos-fueling-10-price-surge/,"In a surprising development that renewed interest in one of the oldest crypto assets, WLFI , a decentralized project in the field of finance (DeFi) and reportedly backed by the Trump family, made another major acquisition on its way to becoming the global standard for decentralized assets. This time around, the DeFi project purchased nearly 3.64 million EOS tokens—turns out a fair amount of them were in circulation. All told, the tokens cost just slightly less than $3 million. The most recent purchase from WLFI marks the first in two months and is a strategic addition to one of the most closely scrutinized on-chain DeFi portfolios. With this acquisition, EOS breaks the out of a multi-year falling wedge and is up close to 10% from where it was before the buy. WLFI Spends $2.996M on EOS as It Resumes Buying Spree Following a two-month hiatus, the WLFI wallet boldly reentered the market, making a hefty purchase: 3.636 million EOS tokens for $2.996 million. This translates to about $0.824 per token. To put this in context, EOS is now part of a portfolio that already held a number of other tokens including ETH, WBTC, TRX, LINK, AAVE, ENA, MOVE, ONDO, SEI, AVAX, and MNT. In recent years, EOS has not been able to regain the kind of momentum it previously enjoyed, but this prominent purchase might be a sign of fresh enthusiasm. Financial pundits were swift to lay the blame for the price increase on WLFI’s operational decision, especially as the EOS price had recently broken out of a multi-year technical wedge formation. The strategy of WLFI appears to be one of concentrated, long-term accumulation of what it considers to be reasonably priced or strategically significant digital assets. While this has yet to bear fruit in the form of actual profits, it certainly seems to be attracting attention, apparently due to the scale of the investment and the rumored associations with Trump family figures. WLFI’s On-Chain Portfolio: $347 Million In, $291 Million Out Following the recent EOS acquisition, WLFI has now invested a total of $347 million across 12 different tokens. The project’s asset mix includes both established names like BTC and ETH, as well as emerging new players like ENA and MOVE. If we look at the current market price of these tokens, the total value of WLFI’s holdings is about $291 million. That gives us an unrealized loss of approximately $53.07 million, or 15 percent. 时隔 2 个月，特朗普家族支持的 DeFi 项目 WLFI 再次进行了代币购买：一个半小时前使用 299.6 万 USDT 购买了 363.6 万枚 $EOS ，购买价格 $0.824。 地址链接 ： https://t.co/kLnqMV3dmf 到目前为止，WLFI 投资组合总共是花了 3.47 亿 U 配置购买了 12… https://t.co/VoAMZPyl2A pic.twitter.com/vgA6EqbIjf — 余烬 (@EmberCN) May 16, 2025 Some may view this as a bad signal, but others see this as part of a long-term strategy to accumulate in a market that is currently undervalued. In fact, the portfolio seems to be in a process of diversification not just across assets in different sectors of the crypto space but also across different kinds of investment vehicles. That is, layer-1 protocols, DeFi platforms, and real-world asset integrations are all part of the this crypto portfolio. Interest in WLFI’s operations has only escalated, thanks to the supposed involvement of the Trump family. No governmental offices have made any official statements confirming this association, but that hasn’t stopped blockchain analysts from trying to figure out who’s behind the project. They continue to track wallet activity very closely, and with even more zest—and with even more zest and suspicion—try to figure out just who is working with them. Market Reacts as EOS Tests Key Support After the latest WLFI transaction, EOS saw a direct price increase of 10 percent. The token has now gone beyond a multi-year falling wedge pattern, which generally is seen as a shift toward a bullish indicator. This change has now put EOS in the between so-called “price zones,” where it’s had high demand in the past, from about $0.83 to $0.69. Should EOS keep this support level, a longer-term recovery could be under way. WLFI could end up with well-timed exposure, but whether it sustains that exposure will hinge on two key factors: 1. The broader market conditions we’re in and 2. EOS’s ability to maintain any sort of momentum in this recovery. Market traders and analysts closely monitor WLFI’s wallet. Every new move they make sends ripples through the market, affecting price direction and sentiment. Whether this means EOS is about to make a comeback or just enjoying a rebound remains to be seen. For now, the strategic bets that WLFI is making are drawing both curiosity and criticism. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

44722346,https://nulltx.com/?p=149694,1747460182,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Large LDO Transfers Spark Speculation Amidst Market Activity,https://nulltx.com/large-ldo-transfers-spark-speculation-amidst-market-activity/,"In the previous three days, the crypto community has been paying special attention to the Lido DAO (LDO) tokens due to some hefty on-chain activity. Or, to put it more bluntly, two Ethereum addresses have sent a combined total of over 30 million dollars’ worth of LDO to some very prominent centralized exchanges—almost within the same 24-hour period. This begs a couple of questions. For one, what in the world is going on here? And for another, what could this mean for the price of LDO? Massive LDO Movements: Over $30 Million in Three Days Over the past 72 hours, two Ethereum addresses—0x2c7AE and 0x3A765—have together shifted around 30 million LDO tokens, with signals that these tokens are being sent to large exchanges like Binance, OKX, Bybit, and Gate.io. Particularly noteworthy is the address 0x2c7AE, which has direct ties to the “Lido: Team Vesting” contract. Roughly six months ago, it received 30 million LDO from the vesting contract, a token transaction we usually associate with team members, advisors, or early contributors. Since then, the address has held a large portion of those tokens and appears to have used the vesting contract to deposit tokens into the 0x address, which it has now been using to transfer the tokens into unknown addresses. For three days alone, 0x2c7AE has transferred out approximately 19.917 million LDO, equivalent to nearly $19.25 million. In October 2023, the institutional trading platform FalconX sent 15.45 million LDO to the second address, 0x3A765. When this transaction occurred, the trading price of LDO was approximately $1.87 per token. In the three days leading up to this analysis, the second address moved out a significant chunk of its LDO holdings—10.612 million LDO, to be exact—making this a noteworthy transaction in the current LDO trading environment. 这是 Lido 机构还是团队的出货？ 过去 3 天时间，包含一个可能属于 @LidoFinance 团队归属地址在内的 2 个地址将 1111 万枚 LDO ($11.53M) 转进了 Binance、OKX、Bybit、Gate。 并且他们在 5 小时前继续转出了 1941 万枚 LDO ($19.25M)，这些应该也会在接下来被转进各大 CEX。 这两个地址是将 LDO… pic.twitter.com/zyOyhKmcQj — 余烬 (@EmberCN) May 16, 2025 The Role of 0xC4Db and Market Maker Involvement The two addresses mentioned above are routing their LDO token distributions through yet another address, 0xC4Db. This address appears to act as a market maker, or at least an intermediary, that helps maintain liquidity in the LDO token. After receiving large distributions of the token from the aforementioned addresses, 0xC4Db sent a portion of those tokens to several large, reputable exchanges. This pattern of token movement—first from source wallets, then to 0xC4Db, and finally to exchanges—strongly suggests that a market-making strategy is involved or that a large-scale liquidation is being prepared. Such operations are typical for managing liquidity across several CEXs or for aiming to reduce price slippage during sell-offs. The uninterrupted transfer of LDO tokens to 0xC4Db means that more transfers to CEXs are probably about to happen. Five hours before this report, an extra 19.41 million LDO was sent out from the same sender addresses, which seems to indicate that this latest batch was also on its way to the same destination as all previous batches: Somewhere in the vicinity of a centralized exchange. What This Means for LDO and the Market This surge in token activity might mean quite a lot for the LDO setup and for how folks are feeling about the market. One of the wallets these tokens are coming from is linked to a vesting contract for the Lido team. So, if nothing else, this setup tells us that those with insider access to Lido are moving a bunch of tokens around. And you can see why, with the price of LDO having doubled over the preceding month. At the same time, the participation of a big global crypto trading service like FalconX adds further credence to the idea that pro liquidity providers or hedge funds are in the midst of some portfolio adjustment. What all these transfers will ultimately lead to—actual sales or broader market-making operations—remains an open question. The volumes are still large enough to demand our attention. If the tokens are to be sold on the open market, we could expect some short-term downward pressure on the price of LDO. On the other hand, if the tokens are used to provide liquidity, we could expect some stabilization in terms of price and trading, although the increase in circulating supply could offset that somehow. Currently, traders and investors are closely observing LDO trading volumes on exchanges and price action for any changes that could be linked to these large on-chain movements. In Summary: Two addresses have given away a combined 30.5 million LDO tokens over the past three days, mostly to a third address that seems to have a market-making function. These large and strange token movements are mostly tied to the team behind Lido and a trading firm called FalconX. Are they trying to lighten their load? Are they trying to give the appearance of more liquidity in the market? We won’t know the true intent behind the transfers until the market reacts, which it will surely do in the next few days.

The move brought renewed attention to EOS amid broader market consolidation, raising questions about the sustainability of the surge. At the same time, Trump-backed World Liberty Financial (WLFI) is brushing off U.S. lawmakers’ scrutiny, bringing attention to politically connected crypto projects. $3M Purchase Sparks Momentum On-chain data shows WLFI purchased approximately 3.636 million EOS tokens using 2.996 million USDT, at an average price of $0.824. The token was trading around $0.77 before the investment and reached a high of $0.86, later correcting slightly to $0.85. This price move marked a 24-hour gain of 9.39% and helped EOS break past key resistance levels between $0.80 and $0.84. The timing of the investment allowed EOS to outperform while the overall crypto market was hovering near $3.27 trillion in market cap, following a mild correction from recent highs.

On the weekly chart, EOS has been forming a falling broadening wedge since June 2022, typically a bullish pattern that suggests accumulation. According to the analyst, the price repeatedly dipped lower to gather more buyers due to weak momentum on each bounce. Now, with sentiment turning, the next key upside targets are $1.30 and $1.95. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Chainlink Inks Strategic Partnership With World Liberty Financial to Enhance Cross-chain Capabilities for USD1 , Rebrand to Vaulta and Token Swap $A is now live.

The EOS token is set to be swapped at a 1:1 ratio into a new token called $A by the end of May. The swap began on May 14 and is supported by Crypto.com, which has been developing a partnership with Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT). The rebranding and ecosystem expansion appear to be part of a larger strategy to reposition EOS as a player in decentralized finance infrastructure. Caution With Bull Sentiment Despite the positive momentum, investors are advised to stay cautious. EOS failed to retest its May 10 high of $0.98, and much of the recent surge appears to be driven by the WLFI buy. If the market doesn’t resume an uptrend, the gains could reverse quickly. Still, if EOS can hold above the $0.84 mark and establish it as a support zone, the likelihood of a continued move toward $1 increases . The coming days will be crucial as investors watch whether hype translates into lasting strength. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

44723067,https://invezz.com/?p=2721599,1747460400,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"Nearly 80% gone — MUTM’s price is set to rise, but it’s still one of the best cryptos to buy",https://invezz.com/news/2025/05/17/nearly-80-gone-mutms-price-is-set-to-rise-but-its-still-one-of-the-best-cryptos-to-buy/,"With over 8.5 million dollars raised and nearly 80% of the fourth presale phase already filled, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is approaching its next pricing milestone. While the window is still open at $0.025, that won’t hold much longer — the fifth phase is set to raise the price to $0.03, pushing early investors into the profit zone. Still, even with the increase ahead, MUTM continues to rank among the best cryptos to buy today, especially for those prioritizing utility, long-term value, and early-stage access. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance isn’t chasing short-term attention — it’s building steadily with tangible results. The growing number of holders, now nearing 10,000, and the momentum from fresh capital inflows reflect strong confidence in what the project is creating. Investors aren’t betting on hype — they’re backing infrastructure. The presale phases are carefully structured, each one raising the token price while limiting total allocations. This built-in progression means those who secure their spot earlier benefit more directly — not from speculation, but from transparent pricing mechanics. One of the key appeals of the Mutuum protocol is its core use case: borrowing against crypto holdings without needing to sell. Rather than cashing out during market dips, users will be able to lock up collateral and access liquid assets — preserving long-term positions while gaining short-term flexibility. This approach is especially relevant in volatile markets, where forced exits can trigger taxable events or lost opportunities. Through Mutuum, users can unlock capital while maintaining upside exposure to their original assets. It’s a functionality that positions MUTM as more than a token — it’s a tool for smarter asset management. That’s the type of practical utility that sets apart the next major players in the cryptocurrency space. Mutuum is being developed on Layer 2 infrastructure, giving it a massive edge in speed and cost-efficiency. Gas fees have long been a bottleneck in Ethereum-based DeFi platforms. By building for Layer 2 from the start, Mutuum ensures a smoother experience for both lenders and borrowers. Transactions will be faster, cheaper, and more scalable — helping the platform grow as adoption increases. For investors asking what crypto to buy now, this technical foundation answers the question with substance, not speculation. Mutuum Finance is currently being thoroughly audited by CertiK — a leading blockchain security firm — as part of its effort to establish trust and transparency before launch. This step not only reinforces the platform’s credibility but also shows a clear commitment to long-term reliability. At a time when many new projects skip crucial audits or delay product delivery, Mutuum is aiming to launch with both — a verified smart contract system and a beta version of the platform ready at token listing. With all the pieces falling into place — from Layer 2 scaling to real DeFi use cases — analysts are pointing to MUTM as a top cryptocurrency to watch in 2025. Several forecasts suggest the token could climb significantly beyond its listing price, especially with demand driven by borrowing fees and internal buybacks from protocol revenue. This kind of growth potential, paired with early entry pricing, is what puts MUTM on the radar of serious crypto investors who are looking for more than short-term pumps. Nearly 80% of the current presale phase is already filled, and once the next phase opens, the price moves to $0.03 — closing the door on one of the most accessible entry points. With real features in development, a security audit underway, and strong demand already visible, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as one of the best crypto investments available today. Opportunities like this don’t wait. The structure is in place, the price increase is imminent, and momentum is accelerating. For those looking to secure a position before the shift — this is the time to act.

Here’s the Timeline,https://timestabloid.com/valour-stellar-xlm-etp-is-set-to-launch-heres-the-timeline/,"SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG), a prominent crypto researcher on X, recently drew attention to Valour’s upcoming Stellar (XLM) exchange-traded product (ETP), sharing a documented update that the product is set to launch by the end of 2025. JUST IN: Valour Stellar (XLM) ETP —> to be launched by the end of 2025. Documented. pic.twitter.com/NrirOVhz8U — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) May 15, 2025 This development is part of Valour’s broader strategy to expand its suite of ETPs, aiming to meet the increasing demand for regulated digital asset exposure among institutional and retail investors. Valour’s Path to 100 ETPs and the Role of XLM According to internal communications, Valour’s management has reiterated its goal to offer a diversified suite of 100 ETPs by the end of the year. The company recently listed new products, including the Valour Curve DAO (CRV) and Valour Litecoin (LTC) SEK ETPs, bringing its total to over 65. The addition of Stellar (XLM) ETP is part of a new product pipeline that also includes offerings for other digital assets such as Tron (TRX) and MANTRA (OM), as well as thematic and leveraged baskets. Management stated that this expansion is designed to “meet accelerating demand across geographies for exposure to digital assets via regulated/accessible investment products.” ETPs, ETFs, and Their Impact XLM recently experienced a notable breakout and has gotten renewed attention from crypto investors. The news of XLM ETPs comes amid a broader industry trend where products like XRP ETPs, especially ETFs, are gaining traction in global markets. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Teucrium recently launched a leveraged XRP ETF—the first in the U.S.—and the CEO revealed that this product was the most successful ETF launch in the company’s history. ETPs and ETFs have provided investors with regulated, liquid, and transparent access to cryptocurrencies, supporting mainstream adoption and institutional participation. The market is eager for more crypto-related regulated investment vehicles, and an XLM ETP could receive similar attention and growth. These products typically trade on traditional stock exchanges, allowing investors to gain exposure to digital assets without the complexities of direct custody or wallet management. The world’s first spot XRP ETF was recently launched in Brazil, showing the global desire for these products. The XLM ETP and Expected Market Growth ETPs offer several advantages for the crypto industry. They enable broader participation by lowering barriers to entry, providing regulated access, and enhancing liquidity. The presence of these products on established exchanges also contributes to price discovery and transparency. As noted in Valour’s statement, each new ETP could bring in substantial assets under management, potentially adding up to $750 million in incremental AUM if current trends continue.

Announced at Consensus 2025 by World Liberty co-founder Zak Folkman, Chainlink’s Sergey Nazarov, and Eric Trump, this integration aims to solve long-standing cross-chain security challenges that have cost users billions in losses. Cross-Chain Security and Expansion USD1 can now move easily between different blockchains like Ethereum and BNB Chain , thanks to Chainlink’s tech. This solves a big problem in crypto as most blockchains don’t talk to each other well, and past attempts have led to hacks costing billions. Now, USD1 uses a more secure system that makes it safer and more useful. The stablecoin already has a $2 billion market cap and was even used in a big $2B deal with Binance. While it’s still smaller than Tether or Circle, it’s gaining trust because it’s backed by real assets like U.S. Treasuries and cash held by BitGo Trust. Controversy? US Senator Richard Blumenthal is investigating World Liberty Financial’s USD1 stablecoin because of its connection to President Trump and possible conflicts of interest. In response , World Liberty Financial’s lawyers denied the accusations and defended the stablecoin’s goals. Bridging Traditional Finance and DeFi Zak Folkman emphasized that World Liberty Financial is focused on the future where traditional finance and decentralized finance (DeFi) merge seamlessly. The USD1 token’s cross-chain compatibility is a strategic move toward that vision, leveraging Chainlink’s infrastructure to bring secure, scalable access to both on-chain and off-chain markets. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Donald Trump’s Crypto Firm Invested $3M in EOS , What This Means for You For everyday users, this update means more freedom and security when using USD1. You won’t have to worry as much about losing money when moving stablecoins between different networks. Plus, as USD1 grows and gets easier to use, it could become a reliable option for payments, trading, and more, whether you’re a crypto newbie or a seasoned trader. Overall, this move by World Liberty Financial and Chainlink helps stablecoins get better, safer, and more practical. It’s a sign that crypto is moving closer to becoming a real-world tool that anyone can use confidently. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Analysts Predict One Will Lead",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/can-1000-in-litecoin-or-xrp-match-ethereum-and-solanas-climb-analysts-predict-one-will-lead-2/,"As the crypto market gains momentum in May 2025, investors are evaluating where to allocate their funds for optimal returns. While established cryptocurrencies like Litecoin (LTC) and XRP are showing signs of recovery, Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) are capturing attention with their recent performance. Additionally, emerging projects like MAGACOINFINANCE are entering the conversation as potential high-growth opportunities. Litecoin (LTC): Steady Climb with Moderate Prospects Litecoin is currently trading at approximately $101.94. Analysts suggest that LTC may reach up to $136.71 by the end of 2025, indicating a potential upside of around 34%. While Litecoin maintains its position as a reliable cryptocurrency, its growth trajectory appears more conservative compared to newer, more dynamic projects XRP: Legal Clarity Fuels Optimism XRP is trading near $2.59, benefiting from recent legal resolutions that have provided greater regulatory clarity. With increased institutional interest and potential ETF developments, analysts foresee XRP testing resistance levels around $3.00. This positions XRP as a strong contender for investors seeking moderate risk with potential for steady gains. Ethereum (ETH): Institutional Interest Drives Momentum Ethereum is currently priced at approximately $2,613.99. The approval of Ethereum ETFs and growing adoption in decentralized finance (DeFi) are contributing to its upward trajectory. Analysts predict that ETH could reach between $2,700 and $3,387 by the end of 2025, offering a potential return of up to 30%. Solana (SOL): Rapid Growth and Ecosystem Expansion Solana is trading around $179.94, demonstrating significant growth driven by its high-speed transaction capabilities and expanding ecosystem. With increasing adoption in areas like NFTs and decentralized applications, SOL is poised for continued expansion. Analysts suggest that Solana could reach up to $190 in the near term, with long-term projections as high as $400 by 2025. MAGACOINFINANCE: Emerging High-Risk, High-Reward Opportunity MAGACOINFINANCE is an emerging project currently in its presale phase, attracting attention for its unique positioning and community-driven approach. With a presale price under $0.07, early investors see potential for significant returns if the project gains traction. While speculative, MAGACOINFINANCE represents a high-risk, high-reward opportunity for those looking to diversify their crypto portfolios. THE MOST-WATCHED PRESALE OF 2025 – ACT NOW Conclusion: Diversified Strategies for Varied Risk Profiles For investors with a moderate risk appetite, Ethereum and Solana offer promising growth backed by strong fundamentals and institutional interest. Litecoin and XRP provide more conservative options with steady, albeit slower, growth potential. For those willing to embrace higher risk for the possibility of substantial returns, emerging projects like MAGACOINFINANCE may be worth exploring.

Democrat Christy Goldsmith Romero announced that she will officially leave the CFTC as of May 31. This departure, combined with the departure of Summer Mersinger, the member who succeeded Dawn Stump who announced last term that she would be leaving, leaves a significant vacancy on the CFTC. By the end of the month, there will be only two members left: Democrat Kristin Johnson and Republican Caroline Pham. However, Pham had announced that he planned to step down after Brian Quintenz was appointed chairman. However, Quintenz's nomination hearing before the Senate Agriculture Committee has not yet been scheduled, so Pham is continuing in his role for now. Related News: Why Did the Judge Reject the Settlement in the Ripple-SEC Case? Three Legal Sources Respond The CFTC requires at least two commissioners to make a decision, which requires Johnson and Pham to be actively involved in every vote. If Johnson were to abstain or abstain for any reason, that could create a serious procedural impasse. And with only two members, a 1-1 tie vote on any regulation would be a major hurdle. These developments come as Congress is considering granting the CFTC broader authority over cryptocurrency markets, and the weakening of the regulatory structure marks a critical period for the future of crypto policy. The White House has not yet made any announcements about who will replace Mersinger and Goldsmith Romero. The newly appointed commissioners will play a key role in determining the roadmap the U.S. will follow in cryptocurrency regulation. *This is not investment advice.
