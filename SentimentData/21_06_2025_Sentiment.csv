While Bitcoin (BTC) remains the market anchor, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining momentum—drawing early comparisons to the formative runs of XRP, Chainlink (LINK), Kaspa (KAS), and Polkadot (DOT). With bullish forecasts and rising price action, analysts suggest it may be nearing a major breakout. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Poised for a Historic Rally MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly established itself as a standout in the digital asset space, drawing strong interest from savvy investors. With transparent tokenomics and a brand identity rooted in values-driven appeal, the project is carving out a unique position in a competitive market.

Key Highlights: High-value bonus incentives fueling investor momentum Transparent allocation built for long-term growth Distinctive branding and utility separating it from typical altcoin launches XRP: Steady Growth and Bullish Outlook XRP is trading at $0.53, having gained 6.7% over the past week and showing strong potential for further growth. Technical analysis forecasts a possible rise to $2.16 in 2025, with a solid upward trend and renewed investor confidence. As XRP continues its steady climb, some traders are rotating profits into MAGACOINFINANCE, seeking higher-multiple gains as the next cycle unfolds. Chainlink (LINK): Awaiting a Major Reversal Chainlink is trading above $15, with analysts watching for a breakout to $16.50 or higher in June 2025 4 . Despite recent corrections, LINK’s fundamentals remain strong, and a bullish reversal could be on the horizon. As DeFi sentiment improves, many LINK holders are diversifying into MAGACOIN FINANCE to capture early-stage momentum and outsized returns. Kaspa (KAS): Building Toward New Highs Kaspa is currently priced around $0.0858, with analysts projecting a potential move to $0.108 by September 2025. While KAS offers steady growth, the explosive upside potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE is attracting both retail and institutional capital looking for the next big winner. Polkadot (DOT): Consistent Growth with Bullish Projections Polkadot is holding near $6 and is forecasted to double by December 2025, reflecting growing confidence in its fundamentals and ecosystem. As DOT’s climb continues, savvy investors are allocating to MAGACOIN FINANCE for a shot at exponential gains, mirroring historical altcoin breakout patterns. Final Thoughts With XRP, LINK, KAS, and DOT all showing positive momentum, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the altcoin most likely to deliver a historic run in 2025. For those seeking the next big move, historical patterns and current fundamentals both point to MAGACOIN FINANCE as a top watchlist pick.

The past few days have been characterized by the leading cryptocurrency trading around $105,000, with neither bulls nor bears taking control. Despite the overall consolidation, a subtle yet significant signal is starting to flash beneath the surface, particularly on the 4-hour chart, that might send Bitcoin to a new all-time high soon. Return Of Rare Divergence Pattern On Bitcoin’s 4H Chart Crypto analyst Luca (@CrypticTrades_) took to social media platform X to share a chart that highlights an important technical development on Bitcoin’s 4-hour timeframe: the return of a bullish divergence. This signal, which previously appeared in early April, preceded the massive rally that catapulted Bitcoin to its May 22 all-time high of $111,800. The same divergence is forming once again and another Bitcoin price breakout may be very close. Related Reading: Why The Bitcoin Price Could See Another 70%-170% Jump From Here As shown in the 4-hour candlestick timeframe chart below, the divergence is clearly illustrated between price action and the Relative Strength Index (RSI). Price has been forming lower lows, while the RSI has been printing higher lows. This mismatch serves as an early indicator that selling momentum is fading, and a reversal to the upside could follow. The previous instance of this pattern directly preceded a sharp move from a $74,000 low in early April to above $111,000 in just a few weeks. What Does This Divergence Mean For Bitcoin’s Price? Bullish divergences on mid-timeframe charts like the 4-hour have a reputation for being the first reversal signals when supported by rising volume. In Bitcoin’s current case, the appearance of this pattern again could mean that the recent retracement from $111,800 has run its course. With RSI now trending upward even as price presses slightly lower, Bitcoin may be witnessing another hidden accumulation phase before its next leg higher. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Trend Above $100,000: The Good News And The Bad News If the pattern holds true to its previous performance in April, the leading cryptocurrency could be setting up for another push toward new all-time high levels. Bitcoin is currently not far off from a new all-time high, as it is only about 5.5% away from its price peak. Based on this, another strong breakout could easily aim beyond the previous $111,800 high. Although Bitcoin’s price is relatively stagnant for now, the presence of this bullish divergence is a reminder of how quickly things can change. The previous bullish divergence ended up with a 50% price surge. A similar performance from the current price level would translate to another target above $160,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $105,700, up by 1.4% in the past 24 hours, already showing signs of the bullish divergence signal coming into action.

33767162,[object Object],1750458623,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin Open Interest Drops 3.5% – More Pain Ahead?,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-open-interest-drops-3-5-more-pain-ahead/,"Bitcoin has remained above the critical $100,000 level since early June, suggesting that the market may be establishing a new price equilibrium. Despite holding this psychological threshold, the bullish momentum has stalled as BTC struggles to break above its all-time high near $112,000. This consolidation phase is marked by indecision, with traders weighing macroeconomic uncertainty, global conflict, and the fading post-halving hype. Data from CryptoQuant provides deeper context into market dynamics, particularly in the derivatives sector. According to the firm, previous deep drawdowns in open interest (OI) — between 20% and 25% — typically accompanied local price corrections of 7% to 21% throughout 2024 and 2025. These sharp drops in OI often signal broad market repositioning or liquidation events that trigger downside volatility. Currently, the OI change stands at –3.5%, indicating only a moderate outflow of leveraged positions. While this does not raise immediate red flags, it does highlight cautious sentiment among futures traders. The muted drop in OI suggests that investors are trimming exposure but not exiting the market entirely — a sign that the current range-bound price action could persist until a more decisive catalyst emerges. Bitcoin Momentum Wanes As Open Interest Hints At Potential Risk Bitcoin is currently trading 6% below its all-time high of $112,000, showing impressive resilience amid global uncertainty but lacking the momentum needed to enter full price discovery. The market has held relatively stable above the $100,000 level, yet the inability to push higher reflects hesitation from both institutional and retail investors. Macro headwinds — including rising US Treasury yields, the Federal Reserve’s decision to hold interest rates, and escalating tensions in the Middle East — continue to influence risk sentiment and stall bullish continuation. According to top analyst Axel Adler , futures market data is beginning to signal cautious repositioning. In the 2024–2025 cycle, deep drawdowns in open interest (OI) between –20% and –25% consistently coincided with local Bitcoin corrections ranging from 7% to 21%. While current OI sits at just –3.5%, suggesting only a moderate reduction in positions, any repeat of the historical pattern could imply a potential BTC price correction of 5–15%. With BTC stuck between major resistance at $112K and key support near $103K, traders are watching derivatives activity closely. For now, the market remains balanced — but not immune to a sharp move if pressure builds. BTC Price Holds Tight Between Key Levels As Market Awaits Breakout Bitcoin is currently trading around $105,910, following a modest bounce within a tight consolidation range. This 3-day chart shows BTC caught between the $109,300 resistance zone and the $103,600 support level, which has now been tested multiple times since early June. Despite a slight uptick in volume, price action remains largely indecisive, reflecting market caution. The chart also highlights the significance of the 50-day (blue), 100-day (green), and 200-day (red) simple moving averages. All three trend indicators are sloping upward, with price consistently holding above them — a bullish structural signal. Notably, the 50-day SMA is currently acting as dynamic support near the $100K–$102K range. As long as BTC remains within this range, traders will look for a breakout above $109,300 to signal renewed bullish momentum and a potential push into price discovery. On the downside, a breakdown below $103,600 could open the door for a retest of the $95K–$98K region, where the 100-day SMA currently aligns.

WIF could reach a maximum price of $3.54 by the end of 2028. By 2031, WIF’s price may surge to $5.75. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to the crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins hitting the market afterwards. Dogwifhat has thus far recorded significant feats in terms of valuation and exchange listing. The token approached the $5 mark on March 31, 2024 ($4.58B market cap), saw massive price movements after the November U.S. elections, and got listed on Binance US, Coinbase, KuCoin, Robinhood, and more. However, a massive bear market ensued, and WIF lost momentum. Leaving investors asking: How high can dogwifhat crypto go? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs). Overview Cryptocurrency Dogwifhat Ticker WIF Current price $0.767 Market cap $771.99M Trading volume $237.16M Circulating supply 998.84M WIF All-time high $4.85 on March 31, 2024 All-time low $0.000023 on November 2023 24-hour high $0.818 24-hour low $0.7394 Dogwifhat price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 13.08% 50-day SMA $0.9102 14-Day RSI 43.09 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 54 (Neutral) Green days 15/30 (50%) 200-Day SMA $1.185 Dogwifhat (WIF) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown Bears are in control of the market. The $0.721 support remains critical. Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart: WIF is down by 3.28% As seen on the daily chart for June 20, WIF has been steadily declining, currently at $0.767, down 3.28%. The price below the middle Bollinger Band ($0.873) suggests a bearish trend. WIF is down by 3.28% Also, the MACD is negative, with both the signal line and histogram pointing downward, solidifying sellers position. The price is nearing a key support zone at $0.721; if it fails to hold, further downside toward $0.70 is likely. Dogwifhat price analysis 4-hour chart: WIF sees small gains in the short term The 4-hour chart shows a recent price correction, with the price hovering at $0.767, slightly up by +0.66%. The price is currently below the 20-period SMA ($0.785), indicating bearish pressure. WIF sees small gains in the short term The On-Balance Volume (OBV) is in negative territory. Likewise, the Money Flow Index (MFI) is low, indicating potential for further downtrend if selling pressure persists. The current price is near key support at $0.761, and a drop below this level could trigger more downside. Dogwifhat technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.6429 BUY SMA 5 $0.7374 BUY SMA 10 $0.8296 SELL SMA 21 $0.8687 SELL SMA 50 $0.9102 SELL SMA 100 $0.7166 BUY SMA 200 $1.1850 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.8875 SELL EMA 5 $0.8488 SELL EMA 10 $0.7341 BUY EMA 21 $0.6223 BUY EMA 50 $0.6368 BUY EMA 100 $0.9194 SELL EMA 200 $1.3486 SELL What to expect from WIF price analysis? WIF is likely to continue its downtrend. If the support at $0.721 breaks, it may move towards $0.70. A reversal is possible if the price recovers above the 20-period SMA with strong volume. Is Dogwifhat crypto a good investment? Dogwifhat (WIF) is a highly speculative meme coin fueled by online culture and community enthusiasm rather than fundamental utility or innovation. While it may present short-term opportunities for high-risk traders during bullish market sentiment, its long-term investment value remains questionable. With no clear roadmap, technical use case, or underlying utility, WIF’s price is largely driven by social media trends and investor speculation. For cautious or long-term investors, it poses significant risk and should only be considered in minimal portfolio allocations. Ultimately, dogwifhat is better suited for speculative play than strategic, utility-based crypto investing grounded in strong fundamentals. Where to buy WIF? Currently, traders and investors can buy Dogwifhat (WIF) on these CEXs: Binance, Binance.US, Raydium, Coinbase Exchange, Gate.io, KuCoin, Kraken, Crypto.com Exchange, MEXC, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, LBank and several other s . Will WIF reach $10? Having reached a peak price of $4.85 in 2024, the $10 target might not be too far-fetched. Can Dogwifhat reach $100? Dogwifhat (WIF) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and could be unlikely. Its market must be at least $99.9 billion – a value that exceeds the highest market cap ever for a meme (Dogecoin) at $88.79 billion. DOGE’s marketcap history | GlobalData Does WIF have a good long-term future? WIF has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of about $1.5 by the end of 2025 and about $3.4 to $4.2 by 2031. However, as with all meme coins, WIF’s future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support.

The announcement named Unico Shipping Co Ltd and Athena Shipping Co Ltd, two companies based in Hong Kong, as participants in transporting machinery and components to Iran’s defense sector. These additions to the US sanctions list follow mounting concerns that Tehran is stepping up development of weapons used across conflicts in the Middle East. “The United States remains resolved to disrupt any effort by Iran to procure the sensitive, dual-use technology, components, and machinery that underpin the regime’s ballistic missile, unmanned aerial vehicle, and asymmetric weapons programs,” said Scott Bessent, the US Treasury Secretary. “Treasury will continue to degrade Iran’s ability to produce and proliferate these deadly weapons, which threaten regional stability and global security.” Trump extends crackdown to Houthi-linked oil deals The same day, Trump’s Treasury Department rolled out a separate batch of counterterrorism sanctions, this time hitting a supply network supporting the Houthis, the Iran-backed militant group operating in Yemen. This move targets four individuals, 12 companies, and two vessels for moving oil and illicit goods to generate funding for the rebels. US officials said the goal was to cut off revenue pipelines feeding Iran’s proxy warfare in the region. The news came just 24 hours after Israel bombed Iranian nuclear sites, an attack that prompted an immediate response from Iran, which launched missiles and drones toward Israeli territory. Both sides have refused to step back from the conflict, now a full week deep. Despite no signs of de-escalation, the White House said Trump will wait up to two weeks to decide whether to involve US forces in the Israel-Iran standoff. The market didn’t wait. Oil prices tumbled Friday as traders reacted to the diplomatic tone from the White House. Brent crude ended the day down $1.84 or 2.33%, closing at $77.01 per barrel. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for July — which didn’t trade Thursday because of a holiday — dropped 21 cents, settling at $74.93. The more active August contract ended at $73.84. Despite the dip, Brent posted a 3.6% weekly gain, and US front-month futures were up 2.7% for the same period. Analysts watch Strait of Hormuz and rig count for clues Traders are watching the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow but critical route for Middle East oil exports. Iran has repeatedly threatened to close it off during moments of crisis. So far, oil flows remain intact, but tension is rising. “The direction of oil prices from here will depend on whether there are supply disruptions,” said Giovanni Staunovo, an analyst at UBS. If Iran blocks the strait or if Israel targets Iran’s export infrastructure, crude could spike hard. Ashley Kelty, an energy analyst at Panmure Liberum, warned that oil hitting $100 a barrel isn’t off the table. That scenario would add more stress to already shaky global markets. Meanwhile, back in the US, there’s pressure on the supply side too. Energy services firm Baker Hughes reported that American oil and gas firms have now cut drilling rigs for eight straight weeks, the longest slide since September 2023. In the week ending June 20, the rig count fell by one, down to 554, the lowest figure since November 2021. The number of rigs is often used as a forward-looking indicator of future oil production. Separately, the European Union has quietly backed away from its earlier proposal to drop the Russian oil price cap to $45, as reported by Bloomberg. That’s another reminder that even as the US under Trump clamps down hard on Iran and its allies, European governments are shifting in a different direction when it comes to energy control strategies.

The summit, which was supposed to happen on July 1 in Washington, was part of the annual “2+2” talks between top officials from both countries. On the US side, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth were scheduled to sit down with Japan’s Defense Minister Gen Nakatani and Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya. But Tokyo canceled. And they didn’t bother dressing it up. The entire thing blew up when Elbridge Colby, the third-most senior official at the Pentagon, pushed a new demand for Japan to increase its defense budget to 3.5% of GDP. Just weeks ago, the number was 3%. Three people close to the talks, including two Tokyo officials, said this last-minute demand crossed a line. Tensions grow as Japan cancels meeting before key election The July 20 Upper House elections are another factor. A senior official in Japan said the ruling Liberal Democratic Party is already bracing for seat losses, and the leadership didn’t want to deal with a public defense clash with Washington just weeks before voters hit the polls. Canceling the 2+2 meeting was seen as less risky than walking into it with a US delegation pressing for more military spending. Christopher Johnstone, a former US government official who worked on Japan policy, said Tokyo usually treats these meetings as a top priority. “They provide politically valuable opportunities to showcase the strength of the US-Japan alliance,” he said. But this time, he said Tokyo clearly felt “the political risk of a meeting before the election was higher than the potential gain.” Johnstone now works as a partner at The Asia Group, a strategic advisory firm. The defense drama comes as the Trump administration pressures both Europe and Asia to increase military budgets. Speaking at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore last month, Pete told a room full of defense ministers and military leaders that America expects its allies to “follow the newfound example” of European nations stepping up. He pointed at China and North Korea as reasons for raising defense spending in the Pacific. A US defense official said bluntly, “The US is now playing hardball with allies in the Asia-Pacific.” Elbridge has been leading that effort. During his Senate confirmation hearing in March, he publicly called on Japan to raise its budget. That didn’t sit well with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who pushed back. Ishiba said budget decisions will be made by Japan, not the Pentagon . Not only did that moment get attention in Tokyo, but it also set the tone for how the rest of this relationship has gone.

According to a Thursday report by Le Parisien, the victim was abducted earlier this week and held for several hours as his captors demanded access to both cash and his Ledger wallet. The attackers reportedly targeted the victim and his partner, forcing them into a situation that French police are now investigating as kidnapping and unlawful confinement by an organized gang. Paris Suburb Sees Another Crypto-Linked Kidnapping as Attacks Escalate The incident began on Tuesday morning when the young couple left their home by car. They had set out on errands. When the driver couldn’t find parking, his partner got out while he circled the neighborhood. A 23 year old man was kidnapped Tuesday while out shopping in Maisons-Alfort, France. The attackers called his partner and demanded his Ledger and 5,000 EUR in cash. She complied & he was released. This is the 10th wrench attack this year in France! https://t.co/ZE7WK8vtcQ — Jameson Lopp (@lopp) June 20, 2025 Minutes later, she received a message from her partner claiming he had an urgent work issue. Unaware of the real situation, she returned home. That’s when the event quickly escalated. Her phone rang. It was a video call. On the screen wasn’t her partner, but another man. The person on the call demanded that she gather €5,000 in cash and a Ledger hardware wallet and place them in a bag. “Violence was used to make him talk,” a source told Le Parisien, indicating the kidnappers had knowledge of the man’s crypto holdings. The woman, following the instructions, waited outside her home with the bag. A third person arrived and collected it. By 5 p.m., the victim called his partner. He had been released in the nearby town of Créteil and was on his way back. French authorities have not disclosed any details about the man’s identity or the exact amount of crypto involved. Police from Val-de-Marne are now handling the case. A source confirmed that the woman has been handed over to the judicial police. “This is a sensitive case,” a police official said. The Anti-Banditism Brigade has reportedly made several arrests in connection with a series of recent kidnappings targeting crypto holders. Tuesday’s attack is the tenth such case to surface in France in recent months, raising alarm among local crypto users and law enforcement. Investigators believe the victim was carefully selected and that the perpetrators had detailed information about his assets and routines. Surge in Violent Crypto Kidnappings Sparks Security Concerns Across Europe and Beyond The recent wrench attack in a Paris suburb is just the latest in a chilling trend of violent crimes targeting crypto holders in 2025. According to data compiled by Bitcoin security advocate Jameson Lopp, at least 32 wrench attacks have occurred globally this year, nearly one-third in France alone, putting 2025 on track to surpass the previous record of 36 incidents in 2021. The assaults are becoming more brutal and calculated. Early this month, a crypto influencer in Essonne was kidnapped and beaten after attackers demanded €50,000 in crypto. They released him after discovering his wallet was nearly empty. In January, David Balland, co-founder of Ledger, and his wife were kidnapped in rural France . Balland also had a finger cut off as part of a ransom attempt. Twelve suspects were later arrested . David Balland, co-founder of French cryptocurrency hardware wallet manufacturer @Ledger was kidnapped alongside his wife in a shocking incident that left him with severe injuries to one of his hands. #Ledger #CryptoCrime https://t.co/IvCjWeovS6 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 24, 2025 In one of the most harrowing cases this year, the father of a young poker player-turned-crypto trader was abducted by men posing as delivery workers . The kidnappers demanded up to €7 million and sent a video of the victim’s finger being severed. He was later rescued by police in a dramatic operation. French police freed the kidnapped father of a #crypto entrepreneur in a nighttime raid on Sunday after he was held hostage – and mutilated – for two days. https://t.co/9THKJ3UMMw — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 5, 2025 Other attacks have similarly targeted families of crypto executives. In May, Pierre Noizat, CEO of Paymium, narrowly avoided tragedy when a group attempted to kidnap his daughter and grandson . That same month, authorities charged 25 suspects linked to a broader kidnapping ring across Paris. The violence hasn’t been confined to France. In the U.S., victims in New York and Las Vegas were kidnapped at gunpoint , one of them was driven over 70 miles into the Arizona desert by assailants seeking access to his wallet. Security experts say the increase in ransom demands, mutilation, and family targeting reflects a new phase in crypto-related crime. Private firms like Amsterdam-based Infinite Risks International report a surge in demand from crypto executives seeking 24/7 protection .

With $20.9 million raised in its presale and tokens priced steadily at $0.007, Lightchain AI is attracting a diverse base of retail investors and builders who believe in its intelligent, scalable infrastructure. Unlike established giants weighed down by large holders and slow adoption, Lightchain AI’s momentum is powered by active community engagement and consistent buyer interest. This organic growth signals a shift in market dynamics—where real innovation and grassroots support may outperform sheer market cap and hype in the evolving crypto landscape. Top 10 Coins Hold Value but Struggle With Community Engagement Despite holding contrary positions from the market, most popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Binance Coin (BNB) experience difficulty in maintaining active community participation. Even as these assets draw in institutional money and volume, their communities often don’t have the buzz of the latest hot new project. Take Bitcoin and Ethereum, for example—what became of the grassroots efforts surrounding those two? Even though both fulfilled their role of providing the footings from which to build, it was a long time before we saw any real discussion outside of price talk. By contrast, newer tokens, such as Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX), have built-up active communities by offering developer grants and interactive arena, promoting more user participation. This contradiction emphasizes the need of community participation to maintain motivation and innovation in the cryptocurrency space in the long term. Lightchain AI Builds Momentum Through Organic, Grassroots Support Lightchain AI is building momentum not through aggressive marketing, but through genuine, grassroots support across crypto circles. As Stage 15 closes and the Bonus Round begins, its fixed pricing and transparent vision are resonating with early adopters who value real utility. Much of this support stems from its decentralized infrastructure—highlighting tokenomics designed for long-term health and builder incentives over insider gains. The full reallocation of the 5% Team Allocation toward developer grants has further fueled its community-first perception. Traders, developers, and researchers are engaging with the protocol for what it delivers: a purpose-built AI blockchain with scalable workflows, privacy-preserving data handling, and gas-optimized execution. Lightchain AI’s rise is quiet—but it’s rooted in credibility. Lightchain AI- Powering the Future, One Block at Time Lightchain AI is sparking a revolution, built on scalable AI infrastructure and decentralized collaboration. With advanced gas optimization slashing costs for AI tasks, it’s never been easier—or more efficient—to innovate. In a bold move, the original 5% team allocation was completely removed and redirected into growth initiatives like developer grants, ecosystem incentives, and core protocol development. This builder-first approach is turning heads, drawing in retail traders and dedicated ecosystem contributors alike.

Analysts predict that Ruvi AI’s utility token could outperform Dogecoin during this bull run, with the potential to deliver a mind-boggling 13,500% ROI . By integrating blockchain technology and artificial intelligence (AI) , Ruvi AI is positioning itself as a practical and forward-thinking investment choice for 2025. Why Analysts See Ruvi AI as Superior to Dogecoin Dogecoin relies heavily on its community-driven hype and market sentiment. However, Ruvi AI brings real-world applications to critical industries like marketing , entertainment , and finance . This results in a broader, scalable demand for its token, making it a more sustainable investment long-term. What also sets Ruvi AI apart is its structured growth model . The token’s price is currently set at $0.015 during Phase 2 of its presale , making it an accessible opportunity for early investors. Upon the presale’s conclusion, the token’s price will rise to $0.07 , delivering an almost 5x ROI instantly. Analysts are forecasting a rise to $1 per token post-listing , resulting in an extraordinary 13,500% ROI for those who enter the presale phase. A Record-Breaking Presale The success of Ruvi AI’s presale underscores its potential. The project has raised over $1.9 million , attracted more than 1,600 holders , and sold over 160 million tokens . These figures demonstrate significant investor confidence in the project’s promise. One standout feature of Ruvi AI’s presale is the guaranteed valuation of $0.07 post-presale , offering clarity and stability for investors. This rarity in the crypto space makes Ruvi AI an attractive opportunity amid the volatile crypto market. VIP Investment Tiers for High-Yield Returns Ruvi AI further elevates its appeal with VIP investment tiers , providing investors with substantial bonuses and increased profitability. Here’s how the tiers enhance returns: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These tiers allow early investors to secure exponential gains while boosting their token holdings. Transparency and Security as Key Differentiators Ruvi AI stands tall on its commitment to transparency and security . Currently undergoing a third-party audit by CyberScope , a leading blockchain auditing firm, Ruvi AI ensures its platform’s integrity and reliability. Additionally, Ruvi AI has partnered with WEEX Exchange , guaranteeing post-presale liquidity . This collaboration ensures that tokens can be traded seamlessly once the presale concludes, mitigating investor risk and enhancing confidence. Industry-Transforming Applications Unlike Dogecoin’s speculative value, Ruvi AI’s token is backed by robust use cases that address real business challenges. Here’s a closer look: Marketing: Ruvi AI leverages AI-driven technologies to optimize ad targeting and improve campaign performance, creating tangible results for businesses. Entertainment: Content creators benefit from blockchain-secured payment systems and personalized AI recommendations, which enhance audience engagement and revenue generation. Finance: Ruvi AI provides fraud detection tools, operational transparency, and scalability features, helping financial institutions modernize efficiently. By solving real-world problems, Ruvi AI’s utility token ensures lasting demand and sustained value. Why Ruvi AI Is the Better Investment While Dogecoin uses hype to fuel its performance, Ruvi AI delivers practical utility, structured growth, and massive return potential , making it a superior choice for investors. With a presale price of $0.015 , a locked-in post-presale valuation of $0.07 , and an expected value of $1 per token , Ruvi AI offers unparalleled ROI opportunities for those who act fast. Thanks to its $1.9 million+ funds raised , 160 million tokens sold , and strong partnerships with CyberScope and WEEX Exchange , Ruvi AI is positioned for unmatched growth during the upcoming bull run.

Instead of doubling down on market giants like Bitcoin and XRP, many are shifting toward emerging plays with higher upside potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE has become a clear beneficiary of this shift, as early investors seek asymmetric returns before mainstream exposure kicks in. Bitcoin (BTC) Loses Momentum to Emerging Tokens Bitcoin remains the dominant force in the crypto market, but its price action has cooled. Following several weeks of volatility, BTC is consolidating while traders reassess risk appetite. As momentum fades, many short-term investors are pulling capital from Bitcoin in search of assets with sharper growth trajectories and more aggressive token incentives. XRP Holds Institutional Hopes Amid Uncertainty XRP continues to garner institutional interest, especially with the Ripple vs. SEC case nearing closure. The recent motion to release $125 million from escrow has improved sentiment, and speculation around an XRP ETF remains alive. Still, traders are cautious — split between long-term optimism and short-term uncertainty. This has opened the door for new capital rotation into earlier-phase projects like MAGACOINFINANCE. MAGACOINFINANCE: Where Trader Sentiment Is Converging While Bitcoin and XRP consolidate, MAGACOINFINANCE is quietly gaining market share in trading circles — and it’s doing so by offering something most new projects lack: real structure. With a 170 billion token cap, a fully audited smart contract (verified by HashEx), and live staking incentives, the fundamentals are solid. But what’s especially driving rotation is the behavior on-chain — early buyers aren’t exiting. They’re staking, holding, and accumulating. This isn’t just about tokenomics — it’s about timing. The promo PATRIOTS100X adds a compelling bonus to early purchases, reinforcing the idea that even modest entries could deliver outsize results in 2025. As larger-cap assets stall, MAGACOINFINANCE’s tailored setup is making it a standout pick among risk-aware yet reward-seeking investors. Other Coins Holding Position Without Breakout Power Polygon (MATIC) remains a respected name in scaling and enterprise adoption but hasn’t seen a breakout this cycle. VeChain (VET) continues building in the supply chain space, though it hasn’t gained traction in trading volumes recently. Injective (INJ) is maintaining relevance in decentralized finance circles but lacks momentum. Polkadot (DOT) is making ecosystem progress, yet the token’s performance hasn’t aligned with its roadmap, pushing traders to reconsider their positions. Final Thoughts As capital rotates out of high-profile but slow-moving assets like Bitcoin and XRP, the hunt for stronger ROI leads directly to MAGACOINFINANCE . Its combination of staking, locked supply, credible auditing, and community ownership offers traders something rare — structure and excitement in one place.

Analysts suggest that if Ripple secures agreements with over 50 central banks globally, the resulting institutional confidence and demand could substantially boost XRP’s market value. Strategic Role in Global Payments The token currently trades at approximately $2.15 , with a market capitalization near $127 billion. Despite this, many analysts consider the token undervalued , primarily due to its strong utility in cross-border financial transactions. As Ripple strengthens its position in the digital payment infrastructure space, speculation about XRP’s long-term value continues to grow. Ripple’s CBDC (central bank digital currency) platform, launched in May 2023, is designed to enable central banks to issue and manage their digital currencies efficiently. Although the platform is based on a private version of the XRP Ledger and does not require direct use of XRP, increased trust in Ripple’s technology could indirectly benefit XRP demand, especially if central banks adopt it for international settlements or currency bridging. Price Forecasts Under Varying Adoption Scenarios To estimate XRP’s potential value in scenarios involving widespread adoption by central banks, ChatGPT was consulted. The AI model offered various projections based on how extensively XRP might be integrated into global financial systems. In one scenario, where XRP facilitates 20% to 30% of global cross-border transactions, its market capitalization could reach $1.2 trillion , placing the token’s price at approximately $20.38. If XRP becomes the preferred settlement mechanism across the G20 nations, the price could climb further to $42.46. In a more aggressive projection, where XRP is adopted as a reserve asset or for interbank clearing by central banks, the total market cap could expand to $5 trillion, translating to a token price of about $84.93. The most optimistic forecast sees XRP powering both public and private digital payment systems, which could elevate the market capitalization to $8 trillion and push the price to roughly $135.88 per token. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 These projections assume several critical developments, including wide-scale adoption of Ripple’s CBDC infrastructure, consistent regulatory clarity across major regions such as the United States and the European Union, and increased institutional use of XRP. Ripple’s Progress with Central Bank Collaborations Ripple has already begun securing collaborations with central banks, with at least ten ongoing partnerships, according to CEO Brad Garlinghouse. While some have not been publicly disclosed, several have been made official. Palau has worked with Ripple to issue a digital currency backed by the U.S. dollar, aimed at environmental and financial sustainability. Bhutan implemented a CBDC pilot using Ripple’s technology to improve transaction speed and cost-efficiency. Additional partnerships include Montenegro , which is developing its digital currency with Ripple’s support; Georgia, which enlisted Ripple for its Digital Lari initiative; and Colombia, which is using Ripple’s infrastructure to enhance its high-value payment system. If Ripple continues to build strategic relationships with global central banks and XRP becomes integral to international financial systems, the token’s valuation could rise considerably. While such growth is contingent upon regulatory, technological, and institutional developments, current trends point toward an increasingly significant role for Ripple and XRP in the digital economy space.

The massive retreat totaled $19.82 billion by June 18, based on data published by LSEG Lipper, making it the largest weekly outflow in three months. The sell-off landed right as the market braced for a volatile mix of war tensions, stalled US trade decisions, and inflation concerns. Investors yanked $18.43 billion out of US equity funds, the biggest single-week exit since March. Asia followed with $2.86 billion in net outflows. The only region to swim against the tide was Europe, which somehow managed to pull in $640 million. Bond funds attract inflows while sectoral equity bets continue Even with overall stock sentiment turning sour, some sectors still picked up fresh money. Sectoral equity funds attracted $573 million in net inflows, marking a fourth straight week of interest. Technology led the pack with $1.5 billion, followed by industrials at $752 million. Financials went the opposite way, losing close to $1.5 billion in the same period. The real demand was in bonds. Global bond funds received $13.13 billion in net inflows, extending their winning streak to nine weeks. Euro-denominated bonds alone brought in $3.07 billion, after collecting $7.97 billion the week before. Appetite also grew for short-term and high-yield bonds, which pulled in $2.93 billion and $1.94 billion, respectively. Investors also dumped $2.7 billion from money market funds, following the $4.1 billion they had pulled the week before. At the same time, demand for gold and precious metals funds jumped hard — net inflows hit $2.84 billion, the most in two months, as markets clearly started hedging for more risk. Interest in emerging market bonds hasn’t faded. They brought in $2.5 billion, continuing an eight-week run of inflows. But emerging market equities didn’t share the momentum. They lost $234 million, with the data pulled from nearly 30,000 funds. Meanwhile, US stocks ended this week in the red, stuck in limbo while everyone waits for what President Donald Trump decides next. On Friday, Trump said he would wait two weeks before deciding if the US military will support Israel’s campaign against Tehran. This temporary pause calmed nerves after days of harsh rhetoric from the White House. By Closing Bell, the S&P 500 had fallen 0.15%. The Dow Jones inched up just 0.02%, while the Nasdaq rose 0.2%, its third positive week out of the last four. Despite everything going on, many investors can’t figure out how stocks keep climbing. Since bottoming in April, the market has fought its way back, ignoring war, tariffs, and slowing economic signals. Chart watchers are still bullish. IBM is the top name in the Dow Jones this year, gaining 28% and even beating out the Magnificent Seven stocks. Industrials are now the best-performing sector in the S&P 500, which some see as a sign that the US economy still has some muscle. Others think semiconductors are the key to a full breakout. If Nvidia can break past $150 a share, it could drag the index to a new record.

Aptos just struck a Web3 deal in the UAE. Meanwhile, Qubetics has raised $18 million in presale funds and continues to gain traction across global crypto circles. It’s a pivotal moment for the market, with Bitcoin volatility and institutional hesitancy giving room for newer, utility-first projects to rise. Qubetics ($TICS), now entering Stage 37 of its presale, stands apart with a utility-focused, Web3 aggregation model that addresses the pain points of fragmented blockchain ecosystems. Unlike typical L1 tokens, Qubetics offers decentralised tools that already serve real-world applications, including a decentralised VPN (dVPN) that promises true sovereignty over data access and security. That’s a significant shift, and it’s part of what makes the Qubetics presale the best crypto presale to buy for 2025, according to many in the community. Empowering Web3 Security: How Qubetics’ Decentralised VPN Solves Real Problems The traditional VPN model is broken. Centralised VPN providers still operate under jurisdictional pressure, potential data logging, and single points of failure. Qubetics changes this equation with its decentralised VPN, built natively into its Layer 1 Web3 architecture. This dVPN isn’t just another consumer-facing privacy tool. It’s a network-level security protocol enabling startups, journalists, and multinational companies to run safe operations without fear of IP leaks, location tracking, or regional blocks. A human rights group operating from Eastern Europe, for example, could run its entire communication through Qubetics’ dVPN, sidestepping censorship and enhancing anonymity. Similarly, a fintech startup scaling into regulated jurisdictions can rely on Qubetics to securely test and deploy products across borders without third-party data compromise. Because the dVPN runs on a token-incentivised node structure, it not only decentralises routing but also creates economic opportunity for global participants. The seamless integration of this product into the Qubetics ecosystem and its real-world necessity positions $TICS as a token that provides utility from Day One. That utility is what reinforces Qubetics’ standing as the best crypto presale to buy for 2025 . Qubetics Presale ROI Breakdown The Qubetics presale has already crossed $18 million in funding, with over 28,100 token holders onboarded. More than 516 million $TICS tokens have been sold at the current price of $0.3370, and only 10 million tokens remain at this tier before the price advances further. This puts early buyers in a high-leverage position. At today’s rate, a $2,500 investment would fetch about 7,422 $TICS tokens. If $TICS reaches $5, that would result in a holding worth $37,110. In an even more ambitious case, a $10 price point would transform that into $74,220, a 2,868% gain. Given that the total supply has shrunk from 4 billion to 1.36 billion, and 38.55% of that is allocated to public sale, Qubetics enforces scarcity while incentivising early participation. With a structured burn model, tokenomics grounded in public distribution, and a product-ready roadmap, Qubetics ‘ presale continues to stand out as the best crypto presale to buy for 2025. It also easily qualifies under any top-tier search for the “best crypto presale” currently available on the market. The project is on track for a mainnet launch in Q2 2025, at which point access will transition from presale to secondary markets. Those looking for high-upside, real-world-backed projects will find Qubetics difficult to ignore. Chainlink Enters Accumulation Phase, Targets $13.20 Zone Chainlink (LINK) is gaining significant attention following a technical setup that suggests a major bullish phase. According to Brave New Coin’s recent report, LINK is consolidating near the $13.20 resistance level, which sits above a long-term horizontal support line. Analysts classify this behaviour as a textbook accumulation zone, setting the stage for a breakout toward $20, especially if the 14-day RSI maintains its bullish divergence. Technical indicators are lining up. The report states that the LINK/USD pair is hovering close to the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level, a key zone often targeted by institutional market makers. This consolidation has been interpreted as smart money positioning for the next uptrend. Chainlink’s fundamentals remain strong, underpinned by its core role as a provider of decentralised oracles. But the current accumulation pattern is what’s driving attention right now, particularly among analysts focused on mid- to long-term growth potential. If bullish momentum persists, LINK could reclaim its 2024 highs and possibly extend even further into the next macro cycle. Aptos Strengthens Web3 Play with UAE Government Collaboration Aptos has taken a bold step into institutional Web3 adoption by joining forces with the UAE’s Ministry of Economy to launch the UAE’s first Web3 Hub in Abu Dhabi. As reported by The Jerusalem Post, the partnership includes other major players like Sui and Ripple and marks a pivotal moment in Aptos’ transformation from a layer-1 blockchain into a global enterprise solution. The initiative aims to make the UAE the launchpad for Web3 innovation, and Aptos brings with it a team of ex-Meta engineers who contribute to its vision of scalable and fast blockchain solutions. Their move to embed themselves within the government’s digital transformation framework signals long-term positioning. The report further highlights that Aptos Labs is leading development in Move-based smart contracts, which enables a safer and more flexible environment for deploying enterprise-grade dApps. For large financial institutions, government-linked initiatives like this one add credibility and reduce the entry friction for new participants entering the blockchain ecosystem. Aptos is clearly not gunning for retail hype, but rather long-term institutional relevance. That focus could turn out to be a strategic differentiator in the coming bull cycle. Final Word: Why Qubetics Still Leads the Pack There’s no denying that Chainlink’s bullish chart setup and Aptos’ institutional strides are noteworthy. Both projects are shaping up well for the upcoming cycle, each appealing to different market segments. But when it comes to presale access, utility, and upside, Qubetics remains the best crypto presale to buy for 2025. Its decentralised VPN application already solves widespread privacy problems across industries. The Qubetics presale offers a shrinking token supply, real-time ROI models, and an engaged user base. For community members evaluating high-utility, early-stage access, it’s arguably the best crypto pre sale right now. As the market braces for post-halving volatility, projects like Qubetics, those with real tools and real traction, deserve a closer look from anyone eyeing the top crypto presale opportunities of the year.

Dive into the realm where crypto and AI merge, promising remarkable innovations. This article spotlights four leading coins poised for significant growth. Discover which tokens are set to revolutionize the tech space and offer promising investment opportunities. FET: Key Levels Hold Amid Declining Momentum FET has faced consistent declines, with a one-month drop of approximately 7.73% and a sharper reduction of about 12.48% over the past week. Over the last six months, the coin's value has retreated significantly by roughly 50.55%, highlighting ongoing pressure on its price. This period has shown a strong bearish influence that has eroded investor sentiment, while technical indicators remain firmly in negative territory, confirming the asset's continued weakness. Currently, FET is trading within a range of approximately $0.594 to $0.953. Key support is around $0.43, and critical resistance is near $1.15. Secondary support appears at $0.07, with resistance around $1.51. Technical indicators indicate negative momentum, with the Awesome Oscillator at –0.0928, momentum at –0.115, and RSI at 42.89, suggesting bearish dominance. No clear trend has emerged, and traders may consider monitoring the support near $0.43 or waiting for a breakout above $1.15 while focusing on risk management. RENDER Slide: 30% Monthly Drop, 57% 6-Month Fall Render experienced a steady performance drop in the last month, falling around 30%. Over a six-month period, its decline reached nearly 57%. Observed price movements indicate consistent downward pressure without notable corrective rallies. The past month shows reduced buying interest and increased selling, while the half-year statistics reflect a longer-term bearish trend. Indicators aligned with the downward movement suggest that the coin faced repeated resistance and lack of positive momentum, mirroring a broader market sentiment that has been cautious and risk-averse. Current price levels show the coin trading between $3.17 and $5.05. The nearest support is at $2.46, while immediate resistance is at $6.23, with a second resistance at $8.11. Bears currently control the market, and oscillators indicate continued pressure. Trading action shows a lack of clear uptrend, urging caution among traders. A potential rebound may be tested at the support level around $2.46, while failure to hold could lead to further declines. A sustained break above $6.23 may signal a shift in sentiment, allowing for long positions with risk management. Current indicators underscore bearish conditions, prompting conservative entry techniques and tight stop placements. The Graph’s Declining Trend: Price Dynamics and Key Level Analysis Recent performance displayed a steady, downward motion with a month’s decline of nearly 25% and a six‐month slide of almost 62%. Weekly losses of about 15% further accentuated the persistent weakness. Price action over these periods has often hovered below previous highs, signaling ongoing pressure from sellers. The gradual drift downward illustrates that market participants have shown reduced buying interest and heightened caution, reflecting an environment where price support remains fragile. The current trading range for The Graph sits between $0.077 and $0.122. Key support appears around $0.06, while a more critical floor is noticed near $0.01. On the upside, resistance is first encountered at $0.15, with further selling pressure likely beyond the $0.19 level. Present indicators suggest bears dominate, as shown by a Relative Strength Index of 36.65. Trading ideas center on testing the $0.06 support line for a potential bounce or a short-term pullback toward the upper boundary near $0.122. The situation calls for tactical trades within these levels as the market remains in a bearish mode without a clear upward trend. Bittensor Price Analysis: Bearish Trends and Key Levels Amid Altcoin Season Bittensor has experienced a notable decline over the past month and six months, with the price dropping approximately 14% in the last month and nearly 26% over the half-year. Weekly performance also indicates a loss of almost 14%. The coin’s historical movement reveals a continuous downward trend, marked by losing momentum and a prevailing bearish environment. Price retracements highlight traders' caution, as past declines suggest ongoing selling pressure. The market's recent performance shows a lack of significant upward movement, contributing to a cautious sentiment during this period. Current price activity places Bittensor in a range of about $346 to $507. Immediate resistance is noted near $584, with further resistance expected around $745. On the downside, support is identified near $262, with additional support around $102. Indicators such as the Awesome Oscillator at -42, Momentum near -68, and an RSI slightly above 41 suggest a market influenced by bearish forces. The trend remains unclear, creating opportunities for range-bound trading. Traders might consider entering positions near support levels, targeting profits near resistance, but caution is advised given the prevailing sentiment and technical indicators.

Check the Simple Math",https://timestabloid.com/holding-2000-xrp-today-could-make-you-a-millionaire-in-2040-check-the-simple-math/,"As interest in long-term cryptocurrency investments continues to grow, one question among XRP holders has attracted significant attention: Can a modest portfolio of 2,000 XRP tokens reach a valuation of $1 million by the year 2040? While the idea may seem ambitious given current market conditions, a range of experts and analysts have weighed in on its feasibility. Evaluating the Entry Cost and Portfolio Range At XRP’s current price of approximately $2.16, acquiring 2,000 tokens would cost around $4,320. Wallets holding this amount fall into the mid-tier bracket on the XRP Rich List , which groups accounts with holdings between 1,000 and 5,000 tokens. Data shows that approximately 8.25% of on-chain wallets fall within this category. To reach a portfolio value of $1 million, the price of XRP would need to increase substantially. Specifically, the token would have to reach $500, representing a 23,048% increase from its present value. Whether such growth is achievable over the next 15 years remains the primary point of debate. Realistic Assessment of Market Capitalization Achieving a $500 valuation would place XRP’s market capitalization at nearly $29.5 trillion, assuming its circulating supply remains at about 59 billion tokens. For context, this figure would far surpass the current total global cryptocurrency market cap of roughly $3.27 trillion and even exceed the estimated value of the global gold market, which is approximately $23.18 trillion. These comparisons underscore the magnitude of the challenge ahead. Analyst Predictions for XRP by 2040 Despite these challenges, multiple forecasting platforms have offered optimistic projections. Forecasts from AI platforms like Grok and Gemini suggest a highly optimistic outlook for XRP by 2040. Grok predicted that XRP could trade between $1,160 and $1,450 by then. If accurate, this would push the value of a 2,000 XRP portfolio well beyond $1 million. Gemini provided a wider price range, estimating XRP could rise between $76 and $1,868, depending on positive regulatory shifts, adoption by financial institutions, and overall market conditions. At the upper end of this forecast, 2,000 XRP could be valued at over $3.7 million. Crypto trading platform Changelly has also released long-term estimates. It anticipates that XRP will be priced between $647 and $810 by 2040. At these levels, a 2,000-token portfolio could be worth between $1.29 million and $1.62 million. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 However, not all analysts are as bullish. Telegaon offers a more conservative outlook, suggesting XRP could reach a high of $160 by 2040, with a minimum estimate of $119. Even at its projected peak, this would place a 2,000-token portfolio at $320,000, far short of the millionaire benchmark. Community Sentiment and Influencer Insights The community continues to speculate on the long-term potential of the asset. Influencers like Austin Hilton have emphasized the importance of increasing token holdings over time and maintaining long-term patience. Edward Farina, founder of Alpha Lions Academy, has noted that early adopters may one day share stories of success rooted in high-risk bets. Coach JV, a well-known market analyst, believes that Bitcoin reaching $1 million could create favourable conditions for significant XRP gains as well. While the possibility of turning a 2,000 XRP investment into $1 million exists in theory, it depends on a combination of optimistic scenarios, including massive price appreciation, market expansion, and regulatory clarity. Most predictions acknowledge the growth potential, but few see the $500 per token mark as a realistic outcome in the current climate. Investors should remain cautious, informed, and grounded when evaluating such long-term projections. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Ethereum’s (ETH) anticipated upgrades and bullish outlook continue to shape market sentiment, while Bitcoin (BTC) holds steady as a foundational asset. Attention is now shifting toward emerging names like MAGACOIN FINANCE , XRP, TRON (TRX), and Sei (SEI), all offering compelling narratives and meaningful upside heading into Q3, 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Top Early-Stage Presale for 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly climbing the ranks as one of 2025’s most-watched early-stage altcoins and a presale price still under $0.01. It’s attracting both retail and institutional buyers seeking high rewards and a scarcity-driven model. Analysts now project upside returns, citing its transparent tokenomics, completed HashEx audit, and viral community growth as key differentiators. As Ethereum’s upgrades fuel renewed interest in DeFi and staking, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a top pick for those seeking exponential upside before its listing. The project’s momentum and credibility make it a strong candidate for 2025’s breakout star. Ethereum (ETH): Bullish Momentum and Major Upgrades Ethereum is trading near $2,800, with analysts forecasting a rally toward $3,400–$3,800 if bullish momentum continues through June and July. The recent Pectra upgrade and upcoming scalability improvements are driving institutional inflows and positive sentiment. As ETH’s ecosystem expands, many investors are diversifying into projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE to capture early-stage growth alongside blue-chip stability. XRP: Legal Milestones and ETF Speculation XRP is trading around $0.54, with the June 16 Ripple lawsuit decision and ETF speculation fueling volatility and high trading volumes. A favorable outcome could push XRP above $0.65, but regardless of the verdict, traders are increasingly looking at MAGACOIN FINANCE for fresh upside in a shifting regulatory landscape. TRON (TRX): Bullish Trend and Price Targets TRON is holding above $0.28 and is forecasted to reach $0.31 by month’s end, with technicals supporting a bullish trend. As TRX continues to attract attention, some holders are rotating profits into MAGACOIN FINANCE to capitalize on its early-stage momentum. Sei (SEI): Developer Adoption and Uptrend Sei is gaining traction among developers for its high-performance DeFi infrastructure and is trading at $0.56 after a 23% weekly surge. As SEI’s ecosystem grows, MAGACOIN FINANCE is also benefiting from renewed market interest in innovative altcoins. Final Thoughts With Ethereum, XRP, and MAGACOIN FINANCE all in the spotlight, 2025 is shaping up to be a pivotal year for early movers. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s strong fundamentals and presale momentum make it a standout among new stars.

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $2.87 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $8. Tezos started strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos survive?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $0.5166 Market cap $541.47M Trading volume (24-hour) $16.88M Circulating supply 1.04B XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3146 on December 7, 2018 24-hour high $0.5384 24-hour low $0.5063 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 5.49% 50-day SMA $0.6074 14-Day RSI 39.38 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 54 (Neutral) Green days 16/30 (53%) 200-day SMA $0.6881 Tezos price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: XTZ is down 2.48% today. The coin is testing support around $0.5160. XTZ is bearish in the short term. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart: XTZ has been steadily moving down The 1-day price action of Tezos (XTZ/USDT) on June 20 shows that the coin has been steadily moving down, currently hovering around $0.5177, showing a bearish trend. The price dipped below the middle Bollinger Band (around $0.5675), and the MACD is in negative territory, confirming downward momentum. XTZ has been steadily moving down The On-Balance Volume (OBV) shows consistent selling pressure, reinforcing the bearish sentiment. This current price action suggests that if the XTZ continues below the $0.5160 level, it may further drop to the next support near $0.5063 or even lower. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart: XTZ is also bearish in the short term The 4-hour price of Tezos XTZ also indicates bearish conditions. The price is below the Alligator’s Jaw, with the green and blue moving averages trending downward. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) is negative at -0.07, and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 37.24, signaling that the asset is nearing oversold conditions. The price is currently sitting around $0.517, with a risk of further downside towards the $0.50 level. XTZ is also bearish in the short term Tezos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.5646 SELL SMA 5 $0.5829 SELL SMA 10 $0.5823 SELL SMA 21 $0.5839 SELL SMA 50 $0.6074 SELL SMA 100 $0.6195 SELL SMA 200 $0.6881 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.5790 SELL EMA 5 $0.5844 SELL EMA 10 $0.5951 SELL EMA 21 $0.6235 SELL EMA 50 $0.7037 SELL EMA 100 $0.8144 SELL EMA 200 $0.8861 SELL What to expect from XTZ price analysis next? Both price charts indicate that Tezos is currently in a bearish phase, with the possibility of further downward movement. However, it might be nearing oversold conditions, suggesting a potential short-term reversal if the support levels hold. Is Tezos a long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs, so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Why is Tezos down? Tezos (XTZ) has dropped by over 2% in the last 24 hours due to broader crypto selloffs, a break below critical levels, and low altcoin momentum. XTZ has dropped below previous support at $0.533 and remains below the 50-day SMA. XTZ price chart Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $2 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance and decentralized applications. Recent news/opinion on Tezos Tezos activates its 18th protocol upgrade, Rio, at block #8,767,488.

For that to happen, future price movements and an increase in Tezos’ adoption must be bullish. Tezos historic price sentiment Tezos price history ⏐ Source: Coinmarketcap Tezos mainnet went live in September 2018 and immediately gained popularity for dealing with the environmental impact of blockchain technologies at that time with its PoS model. XTZ’s price peaked during the bullish cycle of 2021, reaching above $9.0. After 4 April 2022, XTZ’s price plummeted below $4.0; by 9 May, it had sharply fallen below the $2 mark. XTZ surged to about $1 at the beginning of December 2022, but the bears reclaimed the market by the end of the month, resulting in a drop to $0.73. The coin recovered in 2023, averaging a market price of $0.8. Despite the partnership milestones achieved, Tezos (XTZ) had a largely bearish 2024. The coin reached a high of $1.4 in April but lost about 60% by August. The bulls soon entered the market, and XTZ saw renewed buyer interest, which resulted in a peak price of $0.7015 in September and $1.856 in November. The surge extended into December—Tezos XTZ recorded a maximum price of $1.909. Price corrections followed thereafter, and the coin closed the year at $1.286. In January 2025, XTZ reached a maximum price of $1.49, but in February, it lost momentum, averaging $0.72 per unit. After a failed attempt at breaking above $0.80 in early March, XTZ managed a high of $0.6186 in April and $0.70 in May. XTZ is currently trading between $0.5063 and $0.5384 in June.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XTZ|FORKS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-20 23:35:00

Traders scanning the altcoin landscape are beginning to identify MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the most promising under-the-radar plays of the month. As assets like Solana, Injective, Kaspa, and Uniswap maintain various levels of stability, this new project is carving out a lane of its own. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Altcoin Everyone’s Quietly Accumulating In contrast to high-profile names facing stagnation or indecision, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining momentum under the radar. With staking already live, a permanently capped supply of 170 billion tokens, and a fully audited smart contract, the project is structurally sound. But what’s really catching attention is the market behavior: holders aren’t flipping — they’re committing. The bonus entry opportunity through PATRIOTS100X has only accelerated that interest, giving small traders a clear on-ramp to participate early. Analysts and crypto circles are starting to take note — not through loud marketing pushes, but through real on-chain signals. This might just be the cycle’s biggest sleeper pick — and those who understand positioning are already getting in. Solana (SOL) Maintains Momentum Without Breakout Catalysts Solana (SOL) continues to impress with its on-chain performance. It consistently ranks among the highest in user activity and developer participation. However, despite its solid infrastructure and active ecosystem, Solana has yet to deliver a new catalyst to push the price into a breakout zone. For now, SOL remains a strong long-term hold — but traders seeking immediate upside are exploring alternatives. Injective (INJ) Remains Functional But Fades From the Spotlight Injective (INJ) is still recognized for its contributions to decentralized finance, with efficient throughput and integration into various protocols. However, its visibility has declined in recent weeks, and market activity has slowed. Without a fresh narrative or short-term trigger, INJ is losing its appeal for momentum traders chasing the next big move. Kaspa (KAS) Keeps Its Niche Appeal Kaspa (KAS) continues to operate within its unique space, offering a technically efficient network with rapid confirmation times. Still, its growth remains largely insulated, with little market-wide buzz to attract fresh capital. Traders are watching, but many have yet to see the signal to re-enter aggressively — especially when other tokens are offering stronger short-term incentives. Uniswap (UNI) Faces Uncertainty Around Governance and Utility Uniswap (UNI) retains its dominance in the DEX sector, but its native token hasn’t kept pace with user demand. Ongoing governance proposals and uncertainty around future fee structures have dampened investor enthusiasm. While platform usage remains high, UNI is struggling to define a clear reason for traders to hold or accumulate the token in the near term. Final Thoughts As projects like Solana, Injective, Kaspa, and Uniswap wrestle with limited upside and shifting sentiment, MAGACOIN FINANCE is earning a new identity — a quiet altcoin with the potential to lead the next wave. The structure is there, the behavior is aligning, and for now, the window is still open.

The US Senate on Wednesday voted 68-30 with bipartisan support in favor of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act ( GENIUS Act ), which would establish a framework for stablecoin issuers. The bill seeks to require stablecoin issuers to have full asset backing, monthly reserve disclosures and yearly audits for those with over $50 billion in market capitalization. Says pro-crypto Wyoming Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis after the passage of the bill, “Today brings us one step closer to becoming a welcoming home for digital asset companies. Now, let’s finish the job & pass market structure legislation to fulfill POTUS’ vision of becoming the crypto capital of the world.” Following the development, the shares of Circle surged by 33.82%, closing at $199. The company behind USD Coin (USDC), the second-largest stablecoin by market cap, just launched as a publicly traded company earlier this month with an initial public offering (IPO) price of $31.00 per share. Coinbase’s shares also rose by 16.32% and closed at $295.29 on Wednesday. The House of Representatives must still pass a version of the bill before the proposed legislation heads to President Donald Trump’s desk for approval.

Bitcoin’s price ticked up to around $104,000 after climbing 0.4%. It had dipped briefly to $103,000 but buyers stepped in fast.

At the same time, the US Federal Reserve held interest rates steady, keeping traders on alert for any ripple effects. Bull Market Support Band Explained Based on reports, the Bull Market Support Band sits between two key moving averages. One is a 20‑week simple moving average. The other is a 21‑week exponential moving average. Together they form a zone that Bitcoin Dominance has used as a springboard all year. When dominance tests that area, it usually bounces higher instead of dropping further. $BTC.D – As long as the Bitcoin Dominance continues to hold its Bull Market Support Band, there will be no altseason. pic.twitter.com/XCYDyuDxP2 — Luca (@CrypticTrades_) June 19, 2025 Historical Support Tests Bitcoin Dominance fell from about 56% in June 2024 to 54% in July of that year but found support. It also slipped from 58% down to 56% between late December 2024 and January 2025. Each time, the support band held firm. More recently, dominance dipped to 61% on May 14 after peaking at 65% on May 7, only to recover to 64% in a matter of days. $BTC.D – As long as the Bitcoin Dominance continues to hold its Bull Market Support Band, there are no risks of this being a distribution range for $BTC. ✅ pic.twitter.com/GS8r9jNIpB — Luca (@CrypticTrades_) June 19, 2025 Analyst Warnings And Scenarios Other experts see a different picture. Bitcoinsensus warns dominance could “fall off a cliff” before any altcoin season kicks off. That view suggests a sudden drop, maybe giving altcoins their moment. An analyst points to a possible double‑top pattern in dominance. If Bitcoin can’t clear resistance, money might flow into altcoins. But if dominance breaks higher, some believe Bitcoin could aim for a fresh record. Limitations Of Dominance Metric Dominance only measures Bitcoin’s share of total crypto market cap. It can slip if stablecoins flood in or if new tokens launch, even when altcoins aren’t rallying. And a rise in dominance can mean altcoins are selling off.

Yet relying on one technical tool can miss bigger moves driven by real‑world news or fresh blockchain data. For now, though, Bitcoin’s dominance looks safe—unless something big shifts in the weeks ahead.

Speaking via Truth Social, Trump said he should’ve never made Powell head of the Federal Reserve and once again blamed him for costing the US up to $1 trillion a year by keeping interest rates too high. He said, “Too Late Powell complains about costs, much of which were produced by the Biden Fake ‘Government.’” Trump added that Powell should cut rates to between 1% and 2% immediately. He said this would save the country massive amounts in interest payments. “That ‘numbskull’ would be saving the United States of America up to $1 Trillion Dollars per year,” Trump posted . Trump says he regrets taking advice to hire Powell The president claimed he tried “nice, neutral, and nasty” approaches to pressure Powell but said only being nasty got attention. He wrote, “He’s a dumb guy, and an obvious Trump Hater, who should have never been there.” Trump said he took bad advice when he picked Powell and said Biden made a mistake by keeping him. Trump also said inflation is no longer a concern and the economy is growing fast with factories opening and new tariffs bringing in strong revenue. He said the Fed should take advantage of this moment and drop rates. “If he was concerned about inflation or anything else, then all he has to do is bring the rate down, so we can benefit on interest costs, and raise it in the future when and if these ‘other elements’ happen (which I doubt they will!),” Trump said. The rant ended with Trump calling Powell a “total and complete moron” and saying the Federal Reserve Board should override him. He also hinted, again, that he might fire him. “Maybe, just maybe, I’ll have to change my mind about firing him? But regardless, his Term ends shortly!” Trump then posted the custom-made image of comparison below for extra theatrics: Source: Office of the President of the United States Waller pushes for July cut while others urge patience According to Reuters, this came just hours before Powell and other Fed officials spoke publicly for the first time since holding interest rates steady this week. The Fed decided to keep rates between 4.25% and 4.5% for now. Behind the scenes, policymakers are split on what to do next. Some believe inflation is still too high. Others want to cut rates soon. Christopher Waller, a Fed Governor, said Friday on CNBC that he believes inflation isn’t a real threat right now and that the Fed should move forward with cuts as early as next month. “The data the last few months has been showing that trend inflation is looking pretty good,” Waller said. He also said rising tariffs will not create serious inflation. “Any tariff inflation… I don’t think is going to be that big and we should just look through it in terms of setting policy,” he added. Waller said the Fed shouldn’t sit around and wait for the labor market to get worse. He pointed to signs of stress, including high unemployment among recent college graduates. “I’m all in favor of saying maybe we should start thinking about cutting the policy rate at the next meeting,” he said. Mary Daly, who runs the San Francisco Fed, offered a more middle-ground view. She told CNBC that a fall rate cut might make sense, but not in July. “A rate cut in the fall would be more appropriate,” she said, unless the labor market weakens faster than expected. She also warned that tariffs could push up costs but said businesses might absorb the hit instead of passing it to buyers. Daly warned against rushing into cuts without solid data. But she said the Fed also can’t ignore how much the economy is cooling. “We cannot wait so long that we forget that the fundamentals of the economy are moving in a direction where an interest rate adjustment might be necessary,” Daly said. The latest projections from the Fed show a near 50-50 split. Eight officials expect two rate cuts this year. Seven think there should be none. Those expecting cuts believe the September and December meetings could be the moments to act. The rest want to keep things where they are.

46442693,https://timestabloid.com/?p=71793,1750465840,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Google Gemini Predicts Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price for July 1, 2025",https://timestabloid.com/google-gemini-predicts-shiba-inu-shib-price-for-july-1-2025/,"As the crypto market navigates another wave of uncertainty, attention has turned to Shiba Inu (SHIB), the popular meme coin currently trading between $0.0000117 and $0.000012 as of June 20, 2025. With July just nine days away, investors and enthusiasts alike are curious about what lies ahead. To provide a data-informed forecast, we turned to Google Gemini, one of the most advanced AI models, to predict SHIB’s potential price movement by July 1, 2025, based on recent technical and market trends. SHIB’s Current Market Landscape Over the last month, SHIB has experienced a noticeable decline, dropping between 19% and 21%. Even over the past week, the asset has shown a slight downturn, ranging from 0.7% to 11%. Despite this bearish stretch, SHIB appears to be holding its ground above a key support level near $0.000011. This has led to early signs of buyer accumulation, as traders begin to see potential value at current price levels. A notable development on SHIB’s price chart is the emergence of a falling wedge pattern, a structure commonly viewed as a precursor to a bullish breakout. Meanwhile, order book data from exchanges shows that buy orders currently outweigh sell orders—another subtle indicator of a possible trend reversal forming beneath the surface. Technical Barriers and Bearish Pressure Despite encouraging signs of accumulation, SHIB still faces significant technical resistance. It remains below its 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day moving averages—both simple and exponential—levels that typically mark bearish dominance. There’s also concern that a death cross may be forming, a signal that occurs when short-term averages cross below long-term ones, often interpreted as a warning of continued downward momentum. At this point, market sentiment around SHIB is largely described as “neutral” to “bearish.” Traders appear cautious, awaiting a clear technical or fundamental catalyst to shift the short-term outlook. Google Gemini’s Price Forecast for July 1, 2025 Using all of this recent data, Google Gemini provided three distinct price projections based on possible short-term market outcomes: Conservative Scenario: Stabilization Without a Catalyst In a muted environment where no significant market-wide or SHIB-specific catalyst appears, Gemini suggests SHIB may continue consolidating above its current support. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Price action is expected to remain range-bound, possibly reclaiming minor resistance around $0.000012 but lacking the momentum to push significantly higher. In this case, the price is likely to hover between $0.000012 and $0.0000125. Moderate Scenario: Technical Recovery Begins In this scenario, the falling wedge begins to play out as a bullish reversal, with accumulation strengthening and perhaps minor positive developments within the Shiba Inu ecosystem, such as updates to Shibarium adding momentum. If SHIB can begin reclaiming some of its moving averages, Google Gemini projects a modest yet meaningful move higher, placing the expected price range between $0.0000125 and $0.000014 by July 1. Bullish Scenario: Breakout Triggered by Major Catalyst A stronger, more optimistic outcome would require a significant trigger, such as a large token burn, a breakthrough development in Shibarium, or an overall rally in the crypto market, especially led by Bitcoin and Ethereum. In such a case, SHIB would likely break decisively from the falling wedge, push above the 200-day EMA, and aim to reclaim the highs it saw earlier in May or June. Under these conditions, Gemini forecasts the price could rise sharply to anywhere between $0.0000145 and $0.000017. Final Thoughts Shiba Inu’s path over the next nine days remains closely tied to both technical structures and broader market behavior. While current trends lean slightly bearish, underlying signals such as buyer interest and chart patterns suggest the possibility of a short-term recovery. Ultimately, according to Google Gemini, SHIB’s price by July 1 will depend heavily on whether accumulation continues, resistance levels are broken, and any fresh catalyst ignites momentum. In a quiet market, SHIB may remain stable with modest gains. But if the right conditions align, the meme coin could surprise traders with a sharp upside move.

While legacy assets like XRP, Cardano, TRON, and Litecoin maintain their positions, it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE and Solana that are emerging as leaders in this new wave of market momentum. Bitcoin (BTC) Cools After Recent Rally Bitcoin has taken a step back this week, consolidating after weeks of bullish action. Without a strong macroeconomic catalyst or breakout headline, BTC appears to be in a pause phase. Many investors are holding long-term, but traders looking for faster ROI are rotating out of Bitcoin and into assets showing more immediate traction and structural benefits. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Where Smart Traders Are Moving Now While older assets tread water, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining strong traction — and doing so with substance behind the hype. Here’s why it’s drawing capital quickly: 170B Fixed Supply: No future dilution or inflation. Staking Is Live: Traders can lock in passive rewards while holding. HashEx-Audited: The project has cleared a full security audit. No VC Control: Community-driven, with zero centralized ownership traps. On-Chain Strength: Wallet growth and long-hold behaviors continue to rise. Bonus Offer Active: The PATRIOTS100X bonus gives early buyers extra leverage before listings arrive. As the broader market steadies, MAGACOIN FINANCE is proving it has more than potential — it has the behavior, structure, and timing that typically precede breakout runs. Solana (SOL) Sustains Ecosystem Leadership Solana continues to rank among the most active blockchains by daily transactions and user activity. Its thriving ecosystem across NFTs, gaming, and decentralized apps has helped it remain relevant even in market lulls. While SOL hasn’t posted a dramatic price jump recently, its steady technical strength keeps it high on the list for altcoin exposure. XRP Eyes Resolution But Moves Cautiously XRP is still waiting on regulatory clarity, with the joint motion to release $125 million from escrow signaling that the SEC case may soon reach its conclusion. While this has sparked optimism, traders remain cautious due to the token’s sensitivity to legal headlines. The potential for an ETF or integration with SWIFT remains, but timing remains uncertain, prompting some capital outflow into earlier-stage coins. Cardano (ADA) Faces Community Confidence, Price Hesitation Cardano continues to build through its developer community, with founder Charles Hoskinson maintaining visibility. Still, ADA’s price remains closely tied to the overall market and has not generated its own breakout narrative in this cycle. It remains a long-term favorite, but in the short term, its momentum is flat, causing some traders to explore alternatives. TRON (TRX) Keeps Stability But Lacks Excitement TRON remains a strong network for stablecoins and high-frequency transactions, and Justin Sun continues to push updates and global partnerships. However, TRX hasn’t seen much volatility or growth this month. It is viewed as a stable layer, but traders looking for explosive upside are rotating to assets with more dynamic incentive models. Litecoin (LTC) Struggles for Relevance Litecoin has historically been called the silver to Bitcoin’s gold, but recent market activity has left LTC in the background. Without new technical developments or major ecosystem updates, it’s seen largely as a legacy hold — not a growth vehicle — and traders are beginning to overlook it during active rotation cycles. Final Thoughts Bitcoin is taking a well-earned pause, and while Solana maintains strong traction, it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE that is turning heads for those chasing early-entry upside. Meanwhile, XRP, Cardano, TRON, and Litecoin continue to hold their lanes — but lack the same urgency or structure that’s driving attention toward this new contender.

In a thirteen–minute walkthrough of XRP, Bitcoin and Ethereum liquidity maps, the British analyst argues that the market is staging what he calls “a deliberate trap” designed to flush out weak hands, harvest stop-loss orders and maximise upside leverage for larger players—leaving retail participants “screaming, ‘Yay, we’re going to the upside,’ … only to find out they’ve been played.” The Trap Is Set, Warns XRP Trader He begins with XRP’s five-month down-channel that started at the New-Year peak, noting that price continues to hug the underside of a descending trend line. “We’re stuck below that trend line basically looking to see if this liquidity is going to get taken below us. My obvious opinion is that it is,” he says, underscoring the conviction that a sweep of resting bids below remains the path of least resistance. The flush, he contends, would “make our journey to the upside much better and much easier to navigate,” because it would reset funding, scare out late longs and reload the order book for what he still calls the next “parabolic expansion probably up towards the $8 to $12 region.” Related Reading: ‘Out of Time’: XRP Consolidation Hits Final Moment, Analyst Alerts The trap, however, may not be a straightforward vertical collapse. Charts, he reminds viewers, “love doing something like” an initial breakout that rallies 15-20%, convinces traders the bear-phase is finished, and then abruptly reverses into the deep liquidity pocket below. “That’s exactly how higher-highs-and-higher-lows type situations are supposed to get you frustrated,” he says, openly conceding that the pattern looks engineered. The phrase he never uses—manipulation—hovers unspoken over the analysis, but his rhetoric leaves little doubt: “This is how they test everybody.” Bitcoin, in his narrative, may serve as the decoy that sets the trap. The benchmark asset has already slipped out of its own wedge-like consolidation and, he observes, “does like to do this sort of thing” by staging premature upside breaks. He sketches a possible march toward $115,000 that would “delay the inevitable” and then give way to a liquidity hunt of its own. Even so, his mid-cycle price band for Bitcoin remains $150,000 to $220,000. That upside, he argues, justifies dollar-cost-averaging into altcoins even while keeping “a tiny bit of dry powder” in reserve for the washout he expects. Related Reading: XRP 5-Wave Count Shows When The Price Will Hit All-Time Highs Above $5 A more elaborate scenario involves a temporary dominance surge in Bitcoin to the 66 to 74% range. As Bitcoin siphons capital, alts such as XRP would “bleed out,” take the downside liquidity target, and only then reverse as cash rotates back into their order books. He illustrates the dance on twin TradingView panels—Bitcoin on the left, XRP on the right—before concluding that the rotational setup is “not highly likely” because it requires several macro-scale dominoes to fall in sequence. Still, he refuses to dismiss it, pointing to the strategic reserve bill in Washington as the sort of narrative catalyst that could spark a temporary Bitcoin-only rally and demoralise alt-holders. Macro-risk flickers through the commentary—wars that could “shove us down” in the near term—but he treats geopolitical stress as a catalyst for final capitulation rather than a thesis-killer. “The upside is so large it almost can’t be ignored,” he insists, framing the present chop as a high-volatility pause before a structural up-leg. Whether that leg begins only after a full flush or emerges from yet another fake-out remains uncertain, but the analyst’s message is unmistakable: traders who chase breakouts without accounting for hidden hands risk being liquidated first, spectators to the parabola they hoped to ride. For now he is content to wait “for the market to do its worst trick,” believing that the final shakeout will announce itself through a sudden, depth-piercing wick. “You’re being played,” he warns. The admonition is stark: if the playbook unfolds as expected, the pain will be quick. “If we get these levels, that’s where I’m putting the last bit of my dry powder in. It’s $1.80-ish, $1.90 maybe.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.16.
