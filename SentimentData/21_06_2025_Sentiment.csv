The past few days have been characterized by the leading cryptocurrency trading around $105,000, with neither bulls nor bears taking control. Despite the overall consolidation, a subtle yet significant signal is starting to flash beneath the surface, particularly on the 4-hour chart, that might send Bitcoin to a new all-time high soon. Return Of Rare Divergence Pattern On Bitcoin’s 4H Chart Crypto analyst Luca (@CrypticTrades_) took to social media platform X to share a chart that highlights an important technical development on Bitcoin’s 4-hour timeframe: the return of a bullish divergence. This signal, which previously appeared in early April, preceded the massive rally that catapulted Bitcoin to its May 22 all-time high of $111,800. The same divergence is forming once again and another Bitcoin price breakout may be very close. Related Reading: Why The Bitcoin Price Could See Another 70%-170% Jump From Here As shown in the 4-hour candlestick timeframe chart below, the divergence is clearly illustrated between price action and the Relative Strength Index (RSI). Price has been forming lower lows, while the RSI has been printing higher lows. This mismatch serves as an early indicator that selling momentum is fading, and a reversal to the upside could follow. The previous instance of this pattern directly preceded a sharp move from a $74,000 low in early April to above $111,000 in just a few weeks. What Does This Divergence Mean For Bitcoin’s Price? Bullish divergences on mid-timeframe charts like the 4-hour have a reputation for being the first reversal signals when supported by rising volume. In Bitcoin’s current case, the appearance of this pattern again could mean that the recent retracement from $111,800 has run its course. With RSI now trending upward even as price presses slightly lower, Bitcoin may be witnessing another hidden accumulation phase before its next leg higher. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Trend Above $100,000: The Good News And The Bad News If the pattern holds true to its previous performance in April, the leading cryptocurrency could be setting up for another push toward new all-time high levels. Bitcoin is currently not far off from a new all-time high, as it is only about 5.5% away from its price peak. Based on this, another strong breakout could easily aim beyond the previous $111,800 high. Although Bitcoin’s price is relatively stagnant for now, the presence of this bullish divergence is a reminder of how quickly things can change. The previous bullish divergence ended up with a 50% price surge. A similar performance from the current price level would translate to another target above $160,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $105,700, up by 1.4% in the past 24 hours, already showing signs of the bullish divergence signal coming into action.

WIF could reach a maximum price of $3.54 by the end of 2028. By 2031, WIF’s price may surge to $5.75. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to the crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins hitting the market afterwards. Dogwifhat has thus far recorded significant feats in terms of valuation and exchange listing. The token approached the $5 mark on March 31, 2024 ($4.58B market cap), saw massive price movements after the November U.S. elections, and got listed on Binance US, Coinbase, KuCoin, Robinhood, and more. However, a massive bear market ensued, and WIF lost momentum. Leaving investors asking: How high can dogwifhat crypto go? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs). Overview Cryptocurrency Dogwifhat Ticker WIF Current price $0.767 Market cap $771.99M Trading volume $237.16M Circulating supply 998.84M WIF All-time high $4.85 on March 31, 2024 All-time low $0.000023 on November 2023 24-hour high $0.818 24-hour low $0.7394 Dogwifhat price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 13.08% 50-day SMA $0.9102 14-Day RSI 43.09 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 54 (Neutral) Green days 15/30 (50%) 200-Day SMA $1.185 Dogwifhat (WIF) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown Bears are in control of the market. The $0.721 support remains critical. Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart: WIF is down by 3.28% As seen on the daily chart for June 20, WIF has been steadily declining, currently at $0.767, down 3.28%. The price below the middle Bollinger Band ($0.873) suggests a bearish trend. WIF is down by 3.28% Also, the MACD is negative, with both the signal line and histogram pointing downward, solidifying sellers position. The price is nearing a key support zone at $0.721; if it fails to hold, further downside toward $0.70 is likely. Dogwifhat price analysis 4-hour chart: WIF sees small gains in the short term The 4-hour chart shows a recent price correction, with the price hovering at $0.767, slightly up by +0.66%. The price is currently below the 20-period SMA ($0.785), indicating bearish pressure. WIF sees small gains in the short term The On-Balance Volume (OBV) is in negative territory. Likewise, the Money Flow Index (MFI) is low, indicating potential for further downtrend if selling pressure persists. The current price is near key support at $0.761, and a drop below this level could trigger more downside. Dogwifhat technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.6429 BUY SMA 5 $0.7374 BUY SMA 10 $0.8296 SELL SMA 21 $0.8687 SELL SMA 50 $0.9102 SELL SMA 100 $0.7166 BUY SMA 200 $1.1850 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.8875 SELL EMA 5 $0.8488 SELL EMA 10 $0.7341 BUY EMA 21 $0.6223 BUY EMA 50 $0.6368 BUY EMA 100 $0.9194 SELL EMA 200 $1.3486 SELL What to expect from WIF price analysis? WIF is likely to continue its downtrend. If the support at $0.721 breaks, it may move towards $0.70. A reversal is possible if the price recovers above the 20-period SMA with strong volume. Is Dogwifhat crypto a good investment? Dogwifhat (WIF) is a highly speculative meme coin fueled by online culture and community enthusiasm rather than fundamental utility or innovation. While it may present short-term opportunities for high-risk traders during bullish market sentiment, its long-term investment value remains questionable. With no clear roadmap, technical use case, or underlying utility, WIF’s price is largely driven by social media trends and investor speculation. For cautious or long-term investors, it poses significant risk and should only be considered in minimal portfolio allocations. Ultimately, dogwifhat is better suited for speculative play than strategic, utility-based crypto investing grounded in strong fundamentals. Where to buy WIF? Currently, traders and investors can buy Dogwifhat (WIF) on these CEXs: Binance, Binance.US, Raydium, Coinbase Exchange, Gate.io, KuCoin, Kraken, Crypto.com Exchange, MEXC, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, LBank and several other s . Will WIF reach $10? Having reached a peak price of $4.85 in 2024, the $10 target might not be too far-fetched. Can Dogwifhat reach $100? Dogwifhat (WIF) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and could be unlikely. Its market must be at least $99.9 billion – a value that exceeds the highest market cap ever for a meme (Dogecoin) at $88.79 billion. DOGE’s marketcap history | GlobalData Does WIF have a good long-term future? WIF has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of about $1.5 by the end of 2025 and about $3.4 to $4.2 by 2031. However, as with all meme coins, WIF’s future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support.

The US Treasury announced the crackdown from Washington, hitting eight entities, one person, and one ship involved in moving sensitive tools used to build missiles, drones, and other weapons. The administration said the decision is aimed at limiting Iran’s access to dual-use technology — equipment that can be used for both civilian and military purposes. The announcement named Unico Shipping Co Ltd and Athena Shipping Co Ltd, two companies based in Hong Kong, as participants in transporting machinery and components to Iran’s defense sector. These additions to the US sanctions list follow mounting concerns that Tehran is stepping up development of weapons used across conflicts in the Middle East. “The United States remains resolved to disrupt any effort by Iran to procure the sensitive, dual-use technology, components, and machinery that underpin the regime’s ballistic missile, unmanned aerial vehicle, and asymmetric weapons programs,” said Scott Bessent, the US Treasury Secretary. “Treasury will continue to degrade Iran’s ability to produce and proliferate these deadly weapons, which threaten regional stability and global security.” Trump extends crackdown to Houthi-linked oil deals The same day, Trump’s Treasury Department rolled out a separate batch of counterterrorism sanctions, this time hitting a supply network supporting the Houthis, the Iran-backed militant group operating in Yemen. This move targets four individuals, 12 companies, and two vessels for moving oil and illicit goods to generate funding for the rebels. US officials said the goal was to cut off revenue pipelines feeding Iran’s proxy warfare in the region. The news came just 24 hours after Israel bombed Iranian nuclear sites, an attack that prompted an immediate response from Iran, which launched missiles and drones toward Israeli territory. Both sides have refused to step back from the conflict, now a full week deep. Despite no signs of de-escalation, the White House said Trump will wait up to two weeks to decide whether to involve US forces in the Israel-Iran standoff. The market didn’t wait. Oil prices tumbled Friday as traders reacted to the diplomatic tone from the White House. Brent crude ended the day down $1.84 or 2.33%, closing at $77.01 per barrel. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for July — which didn’t trade Thursday because of a holiday — dropped 21 cents, settling at $74.93. The more active August contract ended at $73.84. Despite the dip, Brent posted a 3.6% weekly gain, and US front-month futures were up 2.7% for the same period. Analysts watch Strait of Hormuz and rig count for clues Traders are watching the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow but critical route for Middle East oil exports. Iran has repeatedly threatened to close it off during moments of crisis. So far, oil flows remain intact, but tension is rising. “The direction of oil prices from here will depend on whether there are supply disruptions,” said Giovanni Staunovo, an analyst at UBS. If Iran blocks the strait or if Israel targets Iran’s export infrastructure, crude could spike hard. Ashley Kelty, an energy analyst at Panmure Liberum, warned that oil hitting $100 a barrel isn’t off the table. That scenario would add more stress to already shaky global markets. Meanwhile, back in the US, there’s pressure on the supply side too. Energy services firm Baker Hughes reported that American oil and gas firms have now cut drilling rigs for eight straight weeks, the longest slide since September 2023. In the week ending June 20, the rig count fell by one, down to 554, the lowest figure since November 2021. The number of rigs is often used as a forward-looking indicator of future oil production. Separately, the European Union has quietly backed away from its earlier proposal to drop the Russian oil price cap to $45, as reported by Bloomberg. That’s another reminder that even as the US under Trump clamps down hard on Iran and its allies, European governments are shifting in a different direction when it comes to energy control strategies.

The summit, which was supposed to happen on July 1 in Washington, was part of the annual “2+2” talks between top officials from both countries. On the US side, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth were scheduled to sit down with Japan’s Defense Minister Gen Nakatani and Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya. But Tokyo canceled. And they didn’t bother dressing it up. The entire thing blew up when Elbridge Colby, the third-most senior official at the Pentagon, pushed a new demand for Japan to increase its defense budget to 3.5% of GDP. Just weeks ago, the number was 3%. Three people close to the talks, including two Tokyo officials, said this last-minute demand crossed a line. Tensions grow as Japan cancels meeting before key election The July 20 Upper House elections are another factor. A senior official in Japan said the ruling Liberal Democratic Party is already bracing for seat losses, and the leadership didn’t want to deal with a public defense clash with Washington just weeks before voters hit the polls. Canceling the 2+2 meeting was seen as less risky than walking into it with a US delegation pressing for more military spending. Christopher Johnstone, a former US government official who worked on Japan policy, said Tokyo usually treats these meetings as a top priority. “They provide politically valuable opportunities to showcase the strength of the US-Japan alliance,” he said. But this time, he said Tokyo clearly felt “the political risk of a meeting before the election was higher than the potential gain.” Johnstone now works as a partner at The Asia Group, a strategic advisory firm. The defense drama comes as the Trump administration pressures both Europe and Asia to increase military budgets. Speaking at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore last month, Pete told a room full of defense ministers and military leaders that America expects its allies to “follow the newfound example” of European nations stepping up. He pointed at China and North Korea as reasons for raising defense spending in the Pacific. A US defense official said bluntly, “The US is now playing hardball with allies in the Asia-Pacific.” Elbridge has been leading that effort. During his Senate confirmation hearing in March, he publicly called on Japan to raise its budget. That didn’t sit well with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who pushed back. Ishiba said budget decisions will be made by Japan, not the Pentagon . Not only did that moment get attention in Tokyo, but it also set the tone for how the rest of this relationship has gone.

According to a Thursday report by Le Parisien, the victim was abducted earlier this week and held for several hours as his captors demanded access to both cash and his Ledger wallet. The attackers reportedly targeted the victim and his partner, forcing them into a situation that French police are now investigating as kidnapping and unlawful confinement by an organized gang. Paris Suburb Sees Another Crypto-Linked Kidnapping as Attacks Escalate The incident began on Tuesday morning when the young couple left their home by car. They had set out on errands. When the driver couldn’t find parking, his partner got out while he circled the neighborhood. A 23 year old man was kidnapped Tuesday while out shopping in Maisons-Alfort, France. The attackers called his partner and demanded his Ledger and 5,000 EUR in cash. She complied & he was released. This is the 10th wrench attack this year in France! https://t.co/ZE7WK8vtcQ — Jameson Lopp (@lopp) June 20, 2025 Minutes later, she received a message from her partner claiming he had an urgent work issue. Unaware of the real situation, she returned home. That’s when the event quickly escalated. Her phone rang. It was a video call. On the screen wasn’t her partner, but another man. The person on the call demanded that she gather €5,000 in cash and a Ledger hardware wallet and place them in a bag. “Violence was used to make him talk,” a source told Le Parisien, indicating the kidnappers had knowledge of the man’s crypto holdings. The woman, following the instructions, waited outside her home with the bag. A third person arrived and collected it. By 5 p.m., the victim called his partner. He had been released in the nearby town of Créteil and was on his way back. French authorities have not disclosed any details about the man’s identity or the exact amount of crypto involved. Police from Val-de-Marne are now handling the case. A source confirmed that the woman has been handed over to the judicial police. “This is a sensitive case,” a police official said. The Anti-Banditism Brigade has reportedly made several arrests in connection with a series of recent kidnappings targeting crypto holders. Tuesday’s attack is the tenth such case to surface in France in recent months, raising alarm among local crypto users and law enforcement. Investigators believe the victim was carefully selected and that the perpetrators had detailed information about his assets and routines. Surge in Violent Crypto Kidnappings Sparks Security Concerns Across Europe and Beyond The recent wrench attack in a Paris suburb is just the latest in a chilling trend of violent crimes targeting crypto holders in 2025. According to data compiled by Bitcoin security advocate Jameson Lopp, at least 32 wrench attacks have occurred globally this year, nearly one-third in France alone, putting 2025 on track to surpass the previous record of 36 incidents in 2021. The assaults are becoming more brutal and calculated. Early this month, a crypto influencer in Essonne was kidnapped and beaten after attackers demanded €50,000 in crypto. They released him after discovering his wallet was nearly empty. In January, David Balland, co-founder of Ledger, and his wife were kidnapped in rural France . Balland also had a finger cut off as part of a ransom attempt. Twelve suspects were later arrested . David Balland, co-founder of French cryptocurrency hardware wallet manufacturer @Ledger was kidnapped alongside his wife in a shocking incident that left him with severe injuries to one of his hands. #Ledger #CryptoCrime https://t.co/IvCjWeovS6 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 24, 2025 In one of the most harrowing cases this year, the father of a young poker player-turned-crypto trader was abducted by men posing as delivery workers . The kidnappers demanded up to €7 million and sent a video of the victim’s finger being severed. He was later rescued by police in a dramatic operation. French police freed the kidnapped father of a #crypto entrepreneur in a nighttime raid on Sunday after he was held hostage – and mutilated – for two days. https://t.co/9THKJ3UMMw — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 5, 2025 Other attacks have similarly targeted families of crypto executives. In May, Pierre Noizat, CEO of Paymium, narrowly avoided tragedy when a group attempted to kidnap his daughter and grandson . That same month, authorities charged 25 suspects linked to a broader kidnapping ring across Paris. The violence hasn’t been confined to France. In the U.S., victims in New York and Las Vegas were kidnapped at gunpoint , one of them was driven over 70 miles into the Arizona desert by assailants seeking access to his wallet. Security experts say the increase in ransom demands, mutilation, and family targeting reflects a new phase in crypto-related crime. Private firms like Amsterdam-based Infinite Risks International report a surge in demand from crypto executives seeking 24/7 protection .

Analysts predict that Ruvi AI’s utility token could outperform Dogecoin during this bull run, with the potential to deliver a mind-boggling 13,500% ROI . By integrating blockchain technology and artificial intelligence (AI) , Ruvi AI is positioning itself as a practical and forward-thinking investment choice for 2025. Why Analysts See Ruvi AI as Superior to Dogecoin Dogecoin relies heavily on its community-driven hype and market sentiment. However, Ruvi AI brings real-world applications to critical industries like marketing , entertainment , and finance . This results in a broader, scalable demand for its token, making it a more sustainable investment long-term. What also sets Ruvi AI apart is its structured growth model . The token’s price is currently set at $0.015 during Phase 2 of its presale , making it an accessible opportunity for early investors. Upon the presale’s conclusion, the token’s price will rise to $0.07 , delivering an almost 5x ROI instantly. Analysts are forecasting a rise to $1 per token post-listing , resulting in an extraordinary 13,500% ROI for those who enter the presale phase. A Record-Breaking Presale The success of Ruvi AI’s presale underscores its potential. The project has raised over $1.9 million , attracted more than 1,600 holders , and sold over 160 million tokens . These figures demonstrate significant investor confidence in the project’s promise. One standout feature of Ruvi AI’s presale is the guaranteed valuation of $0.07 post-presale , offering clarity and stability for investors. This rarity in the crypto space makes Ruvi AI an attractive opportunity amid the volatile crypto market. VIP Investment Tiers for High-Yield Returns Ruvi AI further elevates its appeal with VIP investment tiers , providing investors with substantial bonuses and increased profitability. Here’s how the tiers enhance returns: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These tiers allow early investors to secure exponential gains while boosting their token holdings. Transparency and Security as Key Differentiators Ruvi AI stands tall on its commitment to transparency and security . Currently undergoing a third-party audit by CyberScope , a leading blockchain auditing firm, Ruvi AI ensures its platform’s integrity and reliability. Additionally, Ruvi AI has partnered with WEEX Exchange , guaranteeing post-presale liquidity . This collaboration ensures that tokens can be traded seamlessly once the presale concludes, mitigating investor risk and enhancing confidence. Industry-Transforming Applications Unlike Dogecoin’s speculative value, Ruvi AI’s token is backed by robust use cases that address real business challenges. Here’s a closer look: Marketing: Ruvi AI leverages AI-driven technologies to optimize ad targeting and improve campaign performance, creating tangible results for businesses. Entertainment: Content creators benefit from blockchain-secured payment systems and personalized AI recommendations, which enhance audience engagement and revenue generation. Finance: Ruvi AI provides fraud detection tools, operational transparency, and scalability features, helping financial institutions modernize efficiently. By solving real-world problems, Ruvi AI’s utility token ensures lasting demand and sustained value. Why Ruvi AI Is the Better Investment While Dogecoin uses hype to fuel its performance, Ruvi AI delivers practical utility, structured growth, and massive return potential , making it a superior choice for investors. With a presale price of $0.015 , a locked-in post-presale valuation of $0.07 , and an expected value of $1 per token , Ruvi AI offers unparalleled ROI opportunities for those who act fast. Thanks to its $1.9 million+ funds raised , 160 million tokens sold , and strong partnerships with CyberScope and WEEX Exchange , Ruvi AI is positioned for unmatched growth during the upcoming bull run.

With $20.9 million raised in its presale and tokens priced steadily at $0.007, Lightchain AI is attracting a diverse base of retail investors and builders who believe in its intelligent, scalable infrastructure. Unlike established giants weighed down by large holders and slow adoption, Lightchain AI’s momentum is powered by active community engagement and consistent buyer interest. This organic growth signals a shift in market dynamics—where real innovation and grassroots support may outperform sheer market cap and hype in the evolving crypto landscape. Top 10 Coins Hold Value but Struggle With Community Engagement Despite holding contrary positions from the market, most popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Binance Coin (BNB) experience difficulty in maintaining active community participation. Even as these assets draw in institutional money and volume, their communities often don’t have the buzz of the latest hot new project. Take Bitcoin and Ethereum, for example—what became of the grassroots efforts surrounding those two? Even though both fulfilled their role of providing the footings from which to build, it was a long time before we saw any real discussion outside of price talk. By contrast, newer tokens, such as Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX), have built-up active communities by offering developer grants and interactive arena, promoting more user participation. This contradiction emphasizes the need of community participation to maintain motivation and innovation in the cryptocurrency space in the long term. Lightchain AI Builds Momentum Through Organic, Grassroots Support Lightchain AI is building momentum not through aggressive marketing, but through genuine, grassroots support across crypto circles. As Stage 15 closes and the Bonus Round begins, its fixed pricing and transparent vision are resonating with early adopters who value real utility. Much of this support stems from its decentralized infrastructure—highlighting tokenomics designed for long-term health and builder incentives over insider gains. The full reallocation of the 5% Team Allocation toward developer grants has further fueled its community-first perception. Traders, developers, and researchers are engaging with the protocol for what it delivers: a purpose-built AI blockchain with scalable workflows, privacy-preserving data handling, and gas-optimized execution. Lightchain AI’s rise is quiet—but it’s rooted in credibility. Lightchain AI- Powering the Future, One Block at Time Lightchain AI is sparking a revolution, built on scalable AI infrastructure and decentralized collaboration. With advanced gas optimization slashing costs for AI tasks, it’s never been easier—or more efficient—to innovate. In a bold move, the original 5% team allocation was completely removed and redirected into growth initiatives like developer grants, ecosystem incentives, and core protocol development. This builder-first approach is turning heads, drawing in retail traders and dedicated ecosystem contributors alike. The future of AI is here, and it’s powered by Lightchain AI . https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf Tweets by LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",Press Release,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|SOL,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-20 23:00:00

Instead of doubling down on market giants like Bitcoin and XRP, many are shifting toward emerging plays with higher upside potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE has become a clear beneficiary of this shift, as early investors seek asymmetric returns before mainstream exposure kicks in. Bitcoin (BTC) Loses Momentum to Emerging Tokens Bitcoin remains the dominant force in the crypto market, but its price action has cooled. Following several weeks of volatility, BTC is consolidating while traders reassess risk appetite. As momentum fades, many short-term investors are pulling capital from Bitcoin in search of assets with sharper growth trajectories and more aggressive token incentives. XRP Holds Institutional Hopes Amid Uncertainty XRP continues to garner institutional interest, especially with the Ripple vs. SEC case nearing closure. The recent motion to release $125 million from escrow has improved sentiment, and speculation around an XRP ETF remains alive. Still, traders are cautious — split between long-term optimism and short-term uncertainty. This has opened the door for new capital rotation into earlier-phase projects like MAGACOINFINANCE. MAGACOINFINANCE: Where Trader Sentiment Is Converging While Bitcoin and XRP consolidate, MAGACOINFINANCE is quietly gaining market share in trading circles — and it’s doing so by offering something most new projects lack: real structure. With a 170 billion token cap, a fully audited smart contract (verified by HashEx), and live staking incentives, the fundamentals are solid. But what’s especially driving rotation is the behavior on-chain — early buyers aren’t exiting. They’re staking, holding, and accumulating. This isn’t just about tokenomics — it’s about timing. The promo PATRIOTS100X adds a compelling bonus to early purchases, reinforcing the idea that even modest entries could deliver outsize results in 2025. As larger-cap assets stall, MAGACOINFINANCE’s tailored setup is making it a standout pick among risk-aware yet reward-seeking investors. Other Coins Holding Position Without Breakout Power Polygon (MATIC) remains a respected name in scaling and enterprise adoption but hasn’t seen a breakout this cycle. VeChain (VET) continues building in the supply chain space, though it hasn’t gained traction in trading volumes recently. Injective (INJ) is maintaining relevance in decentralized finance circles but lacks momentum. Polkadot (DOT) is making ecosystem progress, yet the token’s performance hasn’t aligned with its roadmap, pushing traders to reconsider their positions. Final Thoughts As capital rotates out of high-profile but slow-moving assets like Bitcoin and XRP, the hunt for stronger ROI leads directly to MAGACOINFINANCE . Its combination of staking, locked supply, credible auditing, and community ownership offers traders something rare — structure and excitement in one place.

Analysts suggest that if Ripple secures agreements with over 50 central banks globally, the resulting institutional confidence and demand could substantially boost XRP’s market value. Strategic Role in Global Payments The token currently trades at approximately $2.15 , with a market capitalization near $127 billion. Despite this, many analysts consider the token undervalued , primarily due to its strong utility in cross-border financial transactions. As Ripple strengthens its position in the digital payment infrastructure space, speculation about XRP’s long-term value continues to grow. Ripple’s CBDC (central bank digital currency) platform, launched in May 2023, is designed to enable central banks to issue and manage their digital currencies efficiently. Although the platform is based on a private version of the XRP Ledger and does not require direct use of XRP, increased trust in Ripple’s technology could indirectly benefit XRP demand, especially if central banks adopt it for international settlements or currency bridging. Price Forecasts Under Varying Adoption Scenarios To estimate XRP’s potential value in scenarios involving widespread adoption by central banks, ChatGPT was consulted. The AI model offered various projections based on how extensively XRP might be integrated into global financial systems. In one scenario, where XRP facilitates 20% to 30% of global cross-border transactions, its market capitalization could reach $1.2 trillion , placing the token’s price at approximately $20.38. If XRP becomes the preferred settlement mechanism across the G20 nations, the price could climb further to $42.46. In a more aggressive projection, where XRP is adopted as a reserve asset or for interbank clearing by central banks, the total market cap could expand to $5 trillion, translating to a token price of about $84.93. The most optimistic forecast sees XRP powering both public and private digital payment systems, which could elevate the market capitalization to $8 trillion and push the price to roughly $135.88 per token. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 These projections assume several critical developments, including wide-scale adoption of Ripple’s CBDC infrastructure, consistent regulatory clarity across major regions such as the United States and the European Union, and increased institutional use of XRP. Ripple’s Progress with Central Bank Collaborations Ripple has already begun securing collaborations with central banks, with at least ten ongoing partnerships, according to CEO Brad Garlinghouse. While some have not been publicly disclosed, several have been made official. Palau has worked with Ripple to issue a digital currency backed by the U.S. dollar, aimed at environmental and financial sustainability. Bhutan implemented a CBDC pilot using Ripple’s technology to improve transaction speed and cost-efficiency. Additional partnerships include Montenegro , which is developing its digital currency with Ripple’s support; Georgia, which enlisted Ripple for its Digital Lari initiative; and Colombia, which is using Ripple’s infrastructure to enhance its high-value payment system. If Ripple continues to build strategic relationships with global central banks and XRP becomes integral to international financial systems, the token’s valuation could rise considerably. While such growth is contingent upon regulatory, technological, and institutional developments, current trends point toward an increasingly significant role for Ripple and XRP in the digital economy space.

The massive retreat totaled $19.82 billion by June 18, based on data published by LSEG Lipper, making it the largest weekly outflow in three months. The sell-off landed right as the market braced for a volatile mix of war tensions, stalled US trade decisions, and inflation concerns. Investors yanked $18.43 billion out of US equity funds, the biggest single-week exit since March. Asia followed with $2.86 billion in net outflows. The only region to swim against the tide was Europe, which somehow managed to pull in $640 million. Bond funds attract inflows while sectoral equity bets continue Even with overall stock sentiment turning sour, some sectors still picked up fresh money. Sectoral equity funds attracted $573 million in net inflows, marking a fourth straight week of interest. Technology led the pack with $1.5 billion, followed by industrials at $752 million. Financials went the opposite way, losing close to $1.5 billion in the same period. The real demand was in bonds. Global bond funds received $13.13 billion in net inflows, extending their winning streak to nine weeks. Euro-denominated bonds alone brought in $3.07 billion, after collecting $7.97 billion the week before. Appetite also grew for short-term and high-yield bonds, which pulled in $2.93 billion and $1.94 billion, respectively. Investors also dumped $2.7 billion from money market funds, following the $4.1 billion they had pulled the week before. At the same time, demand for gold and precious metals funds jumped hard — net inflows hit $2.84 billion, the most in two months, as markets clearly started hedging for more risk. Interest in emerging market bonds hasn’t faded. They brought in $2.5 billion, continuing an eight-week run of inflows. But emerging market equities didn’t share the momentum. They lost $234 million, with the data pulled from nearly 30,000 funds. Meanwhile, US stocks ended this week in the red, stuck in limbo while everyone waits for what President Donald Trump decides next. On Friday, Trump said he would wait two weeks before deciding if the US military will support Israel’s campaign against Tehran. This temporary pause calmed nerves after days of harsh rhetoric from the White House. By Closing Bell, the S&P 500 had fallen 0.15%. The Dow Jones inched up just 0.02%, while the Nasdaq rose 0.2%, its third positive week out of the last four. Despite everything going on, many investors can’t figure out how stocks keep climbing. Since bottoming in April, the market has fought its way back, ignoring war, tariffs, and slowing economic signals. Chart watchers are still bullish. IBM is the top name in the Dow Jones this year, gaining 28% and even beating out the Magnificent Seven stocks. Industrials are now the best-performing sector in the S&P 500, which some see as a sign that the US economy still has some muscle. Others think semiconductors are the key to a full breakout. If Nvidia can break past $150 a share, it could drag the index to a new record.

Aptos just struck a Web3 deal in the UAE. Meanwhile, Qubetics has raised $18 million in presale funds and continues to gain traction across global crypto circles. It’s a pivotal moment for the market, with Bitcoin volatility and institutional hesitancy giving room for newer, utility-first projects to rise. Qubetics ($TICS), now entering Stage 37 of its presale, stands apart with a utility-focused, Web3 aggregation model that addresses the pain points of fragmented blockchain ecosystems. Unlike typical L1 tokens, Qubetics offers decentralised tools that already serve real-world applications, including a decentralised VPN (dVPN) that promises true sovereignty over data access and security. That’s a significant shift, and it’s part of what makes the Qubetics presale the best crypto presale to buy for 2025, according to many in the community. Empowering Web3 Security: How Qubetics’ Decentralised VPN Solves Real Problems The traditional VPN model is broken. Centralised VPN providers still operate under jurisdictional pressure, potential data logging, and single points of failure. Qubetics changes this equation with its decentralised VPN, built natively into its Layer 1 Web3 architecture. This dVPN isn’t just another consumer-facing privacy tool. It’s a network-level security protocol enabling startups, journalists, and multinational companies to run safe operations without fear of IP leaks, location tracking, or regional blocks. A human rights group operating from Eastern Europe, for example, could run its entire communication through Qubetics’ dVPN, sidestepping censorship and enhancing anonymity. Similarly, a fintech startup scaling into regulated jurisdictions can rely on Qubetics to securely test and deploy products across borders without third-party data compromise. Because the dVPN runs on a token-incentivised node structure, it not only decentralises routing but also creates economic opportunity for global participants. The seamless integration of this product into the Qubetics ecosystem and its real-world necessity positions $TICS as a token that provides utility from Day One. That utility is what reinforces Qubetics’ standing as the best crypto presale to buy for 2025 . Qubetics Presale ROI Breakdown The Qubetics presale has already crossed $18 million in funding, with over 28,100 token holders onboarded. More than 516 million $TICS tokens have been sold at the current price of $0.3370, and only 10 million tokens remain at this tier before the price advances further. This puts early buyers in a high-leverage position. At today’s rate, a $2,500 investment would fetch about 7,422 $TICS tokens. If $TICS reaches $5, that would result in a holding worth $37,110. In an even more ambitious case, a $10 price point would transform that into $74,220, a 2,868% gain. Given that the total supply has shrunk from 4 billion to 1.36 billion, and 38.55% of that is allocated to public sale, Qubetics enforces scarcity while incentivising early participation. With a structured burn model, tokenomics grounded in public distribution, and a product-ready roadmap, Qubetics ‘ presale continues to stand out as the best crypto presale to buy for 2025. It also easily qualifies under any top-tier search for the “best crypto presale” currently available on the market. The project is on track for a mainnet launch in Q2 2025, at which point access will transition from presale to secondary markets. Those looking for high-upside, real-world-backed projects will find Qubetics difficult to ignore. Chainlink Enters Accumulation Phase, Targets $13.20 Zone Chainlink (LINK) is gaining significant attention following a technical setup that suggests a major bullish phase. According to Brave New Coin’s recent report, LINK is consolidating near the $13.20 resistance level, which sits above a long-term horizontal support line. Analysts classify this behaviour as a textbook accumulation zone, setting the stage for a breakout toward $20, especially if the 14-day RSI maintains its bullish divergence. Technical indicators are lining up. The report states that the LINK/USD pair is hovering close to the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level, a key zone often targeted by institutional market makers. This consolidation has been interpreted as smart money positioning for the next uptrend. Chainlink’s fundamentals remain strong, underpinned by its core role as a provider of decentralised oracles. But the current accumulation pattern is what’s driving attention right now, particularly among analysts focused on mid- to long-term growth potential. If bullish momentum persists, LINK could reclaim its 2024 highs and possibly extend even further into the next macro cycle. Aptos Strengthens Web3 Play with UAE Government Collaboration Aptos has taken a bold step into institutional Web3 adoption by joining forces with the UAE’s Ministry of Economy to launch the UAE’s first Web3 Hub in Abu Dhabi. As reported by The Jerusalem Post, the partnership includes other major players like Sui and Ripple and marks a pivotal moment in Aptos’ transformation from a layer-1 blockchain into a global enterprise solution. The initiative aims to make the UAE the launchpad for Web3 innovation, and Aptos brings with it a team of ex-Meta engineers who contribute to its vision of scalable and fast blockchain solutions. Their move to embed themselves within the government’s digital transformation framework signals long-term positioning. The report further highlights that Aptos Labs is leading development in Move-based smart contracts, which enables a safer and more flexible environment for deploying enterprise-grade dApps. For large financial institutions, government-linked initiatives like this one add credibility and reduce the entry friction for new participants entering the blockchain ecosystem. Aptos is clearly not gunning for retail hype, but rather long-term institutional relevance. That focus could turn out to be a strategic differentiator in the coming bull cycle. Final Word: Why Qubetics Still Leads the Pack There’s no denying that Chainlink’s bullish chart setup and Aptos’ institutional strides are noteworthy. Both projects are shaping up well for the upcoming cycle, each appealing to different market segments. But when it comes to presale access, utility, and upside, Qubetics remains the best crypto presale to buy for 2025. Its decentralised VPN application already solves widespread privacy problems across industries. The Qubetics presale offers a shrinking token supply, real-time ROI models, and an engaged user base. For community members evaluating high-utility, early-stage access, it’s arguably the best crypto pre sale right now. As the market braces for post-halving volatility, projects like Qubetics, those with real tools and real traction, deserve a closer look from anyone eyeing the top crypto presale opportunities of the year.

Qubetics is widely considered the best crypto presale to buy for 2025 due to its utility-driven model, shrinking token supply, and real-time use cases. Is the Qubetics presale still live? Yes, the Qubetics presale is currently in Stage 37 with limited tokens left at $0.3370 before the price moves to the next tier. Why is Qubetics considered a top crypto pre sale project? Qubetics combines strong tokenomics, decentralised applications like its VPN, and multi-chain Web3 tools, making it one of the most trusted and scalable pre-sale offerings in 2025.

Dive into the realm where crypto and AI merge, promising remarkable innovations. This article spotlights four leading coins poised for significant growth. Discover which tokens are set to revolutionize the tech space and offer promising investment opportunities. FET: Key Levels Hold Amid Declining Momentum FET has faced consistent declines, with a one-month drop of approximately 7.73% and a sharper reduction of about 12.48% over the past week. Over the last six months, the coin's value has retreated significantly by roughly 50.55%, highlighting ongoing pressure on its price. This period has shown a strong bearish influence that has eroded investor sentiment, while technical indicators remain firmly in negative territory, confirming the asset's continued weakness. Currently, FET is trading within a range of approximately $0.594 to $0.953. Key support is around $0.43, and critical resistance is near $1.15. Secondary support appears at $0.07, with resistance around $1.51. Technical indicators indicate negative momentum, with the Awesome Oscillator at –0.0928, momentum at –0.115, and RSI at 42.89, suggesting bearish dominance. No clear trend has emerged, and traders may consider monitoring the support near $0.43 or waiting for a breakout above $1.15 while focusing on risk management. RENDER Slide: 30% Monthly Drop, 57% 6-Month Fall Render experienced a steady performance drop in the last month, falling around 30%. Over a six-month period, its decline reached nearly 57%. Observed price movements indicate consistent downward pressure without notable corrective rallies. The past month shows reduced buying interest and increased selling, while the half-year statistics reflect a longer-term bearish trend. Indicators aligned with the downward movement suggest that the coin faced repeated resistance and lack of positive momentum, mirroring a broader market sentiment that has been cautious and risk-averse. Current price levels show the coin trading between $3.17 and $5.05. The nearest support is at $2.46, while immediate resistance is at $6.23, with a second resistance at $8.11. Bears currently control the market, and oscillators indicate continued pressure. Trading action shows a lack of clear uptrend, urging caution among traders. A potential rebound may be tested at the support level around $2.46, while failure to hold could lead to further declines. A sustained break above $6.23 may signal a shift in sentiment, allowing for long positions with risk management. Current indicators underscore bearish conditions, prompting conservative entry techniques and tight stop placements. The Graph’s Declining Trend: Price Dynamics and Key Level Analysis Recent performance displayed a steady, downward motion with a month’s decline of nearly 25% and a six‐month slide of almost 62%. Weekly losses of about 15% further accentuated the persistent weakness. Price action over these periods has often hovered below previous highs, signaling ongoing pressure from sellers. The gradual drift downward illustrates that market participants have shown reduced buying interest and heightened caution, reflecting an environment where price support remains fragile. The current trading range for The Graph sits between $0.077 and $0.122. Key support appears around $0.06, while a more critical floor is noticed near $0.01. On the upside, resistance is first encountered at $0.15, with further selling pressure likely beyond the $0.19 level. Present indicators suggest bears dominate, as shown by a Relative Strength Index of 36.65. Trading ideas center on testing the $0.06 support line for a potential bounce or a short-term pullback toward the upper boundary near $0.122. The situation calls for tactical trades within these levels as the market remains in a bearish mode without a clear upward trend. Bittensor Price Analysis: Bearish Trends and Key Levels Amid Altcoin Season Bittensor has experienced a notable decline over the past month and six months, with the price dropping approximately 14% in the last month and nearly 26% over the half-year. Weekly performance also indicates a loss of almost 14%. The coin’s historical movement reveals a continuous downward trend, marked by losing momentum and a prevailing bearish environment. Price retracements highlight traders' caution, as past declines suggest ongoing selling pressure. The market's recent performance shows a lack of significant upward movement, contributing to a cautious sentiment during this period. Current price activity places Bittensor in a range of about $346 to $507. Immediate resistance is noted near $584, with further resistance expected around $745. On the downside, support is identified near $262, with additional support around $102. Indicators such as the Awesome Oscillator at -42, Momentum near -68, and an RSI slightly above 41 suggest a market influenced by bearish forces. The trend remains unclear, creating opportunities for range-bound trading. Traders might consider entering positions near support levels, targeting profits near resistance, but caution is advised given the prevailing sentiment and technical indicators.

Check the Simple Math",https://timestabloid.com/holding-2000-xrp-today-could-make-you-a-millionaire-in-2040-check-the-simple-math/,"As interest in long-term cryptocurrency investments continues to grow, one question among XRP holders has attracted significant attention: Can a modest portfolio of 2,000 XRP tokens reach a valuation of $1 million by the year 2040? While the idea may seem ambitious given current market conditions, a range of experts and analysts have weighed in on its feasibility. Evaluating the Entry Cost and Portfolio Range At XRP’s current price of approximately $2.16, acquiring 2,000 tokens would cost around $4,320. Wallets holding this amount fall into the mid-tier bracket on the XRP Rich List , which groups accounts with holdings between 1,000 and 5,000 tokens. Data shows that approximately 8.25% of on-chain wallets fall within this category. To reach a portfolio value of $1 million, the price of XRP would need to increase substantially. Specifically, the token would have to reach $500, representing a 23,048% increase from its present value. Whether such growth is achievable over the next 15 years remains the primary point of debate. Realistic Assessment of Market Capitalization Achieving a $500 valuation would place XRP’s market capitalization at nearly $29.5 trillion, assuming its circulating supply remains at about 59 billion tokens. For context, this figure would far surpass the current total global cryptocurrency market cap of roughly $3.27 trillion and even exceed the estimated value of the global gold market, which is approximately $23.18 trillion. These comparisons underscore the magnitude of the challenge ahead. Analyst Predictions for XRP by 2040 Despite these challenges, multiple forecasting platforms have offered optimistic projections. Forecasts from AI platforms like Grok and Gemini suggest a highly optimistic outlook for XRP by 2040. Grok predicted that XRP could trade between $1,160 and $1,450 by then. If accurate, this would push the value of a 2,000 XRP portfolio well beyond $1 million. Gemini provided a wider price range, estimating XRP could rise between $76 and $1,868, depending on positive regulatory shifts, adoption by financial institutions, and overall market conditions. At the upper end of this forecast, 2,000 XRP could be valued at over $3.7 million. Crypto trading platform Changelly has also released long-term estimates. It anticipates that XRP will be priced between $647 and $810 by 2040. At these levels, a 2,000-token portfolio could be worth between $1.29 million and $1.62 million. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 However, not all analysts are as bullish. Telegaon offers a more conservative outlook, suggesting XRP could reach a high of $160 by 2040, with a minimum estimate of $119. Even at its projected peak, this would place a 2,000-token portfolio at $320,000, far short of the millionaire benchmark. Community Sentiment and Influencer Insights The community continues to speculate on the long-term potential of the asset. Influencers like Austin Hilton have emphasized the importance of increasing token holdings over time and maintaining long-term patience. Edward Farina, founder of Alpha Lions Academy, has noted that early adopters may one day share stories of success rooted in high-risk bets. Coach JV, a well-known market analyst, believes that Bitcoin reaching $1 million could create favourable conditions for significant XRP gains as well. While the possibility of turning a 2,000 XRP investment into $1 million exists in theory, it depends on a combination of optimistic scenarios, including massive price appreciation, market expansion, and regulatory clarity. Most predictions acknowledge the growth potential, but few see the $500 per token mark as a realistic outcome in the current climate. Investors should remain cautious, informed, and grounded when evaluating such long-term projections. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Ethereum’s (ETH) anticipated upgrades and bullish outlook continue to shape market sentiment, while Bitcoin (BTC) holds steady as a foundational asset. Attention is now shifting toward emerging names like MAGACOIN FINANCE , XRP, TRON (TRX), and Sei (SEI), all offering compelling narratives and meaningful upside heading into Q3, 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Top Early-Stage Presale for 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly climbing the ranks as one of 2025’s most-watched early-stage altcoins and a presale price still under $0.01. It’s attracting both retail and institutional buyers seeking high rewards and a scarcity-driven model. Analysts now project upside returns, citing its transparent tokenomics, completed HashEx audit, and viral community growth as key differentiators. As Ethereum’s upgrades fuel renewed interest in DeFi and staking, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a top pick for those seeking exponential upside before its listing. The project’s momentum and credibility make it a strong candidate for 2025’s breakout star. Ethereum (ETH): Bullish Momentum and Major Upgrades Ethereum is trading near $2,800, with analysts forecasting a rally toward $3,400–$3,800 if bullish momentum continues through June and July. The recent Pectra upgrade and upcoming scalability improvements are driving institutional inflows and positive sentiment. As ETH’s ecosystem expands, many investors are diversifying into projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE to capture early-stage growth alongside blue-chip stability. XRP: Legal Milestones and ETF Speculation XRP is trading around $0.54, with the June 16 Ripple lawsuit decision and ETF speculation fueling volatility and high trading volumes. A favorable outcome could push XRP above $0.65, but regardless of the verdict, traders are increasingly looking at MAGACOIN FINANCE for fresh upside in a shifting regulatory landscape. TRON (TRX): Bullish Trend and Price Targets TRON is holding above $0.28 and is forecasted to reach $0.31 by month’s end, with technicals supporting a bullish trend. As TRX continues to attract attention, some holders are rotating profits into MAGACOIN FINANCE to capitalize on its early-stage momentum. Sei (SEI): Developer Adoption and Uptrend Sei is gaining traction among developers for its high-performance DeFi infrastructure and is trading at $0.56 after a 23% weekly surge. As SEI’s ecosystem grows, MAGACOIN FINANCE is also benefiting from renewed market interest in innovative altcoins. Final Thoughts With Ethereum, XRP, and MAGACOIN FINANCE all in the spotlight, 2025 is shaping up to be a pivotal year for early movers. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s strong fundamentals and presale momentum make it a standout among new stars.

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $2.87 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $8. Tezos started strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos survive?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $0.5166 Market cap $541.47M Trading volume (24-hour) $16.88M Circulating supply 1.04B XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3146 on December 7, 2018 24-hour high $0.5384 24-hour low $0.5063 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 5.49% 50-day SMA $0.6074 14-Day RSI 39.38 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 54 (Neutral) Green days 16/30 (53%) 200-day SMA $0.6881 Tezos price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: XTZ is down 2.48% today. The coin is testing support around $0.5160. XTZ is bearish in the short term. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart: XTZ has been steadily moving down The 1-day price action of Tezos (XTZ/USDT) on June 20 shows that the coin has been steadily moving down, currently hovering around $0.5177, showing a bearish trend. The price dipped below the middle Bollinger Band (around $0.5675), and the MACD is in negative territory, confirming downward momentum. XTZ has been steadily moving down The On-Balance Volume (OBV) shows consistent selling pressure, reinforcing the bearish sentiment. This current price action suggests that if the XTZ continues below the $0.5160 level, it may further drop to the next support near $0.5063 or even lower. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart: XTZ is also bearish in the short term The 4-hour price of Tezos XTZ also indicates bearish conditions. The price is below the Alligator’s Jaw, with the green and blue moving averages trending downward. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) is negative at -0.07, and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 37.24, signaling that the asset is nearing oversold conditions. The price is currently sitting around $0.517, with a risk of further downside towards the $0.50 level. XTZ is also bearish in the short term Tezos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.5646 SELL SMA 5 $0.5829 SELL SMA 10 $0.5823 SELL SMA 21 $0.5839 SELL SMA 50 $0.6074 SELL SMA 100 $0.6195 SELL SMA 200 $0.6881 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.5790 SELL EMA 5 $0.5844 SELL EMA 10 $0.5951 SELL EMA 21 $0.6235 SELL EMA 50 $0.7037 SELL EMA 100 $0.8144 SELL EMA 200 $0.8861 SELL What to expect from XTZ price analysis next? Both price charts indicate that Tezos is currently in a bearish phase, with the possibility of further downward movement. However, it might be nearing oversold conditions, suggesting a potential short-term reversal if the support levels hold. Is Tezos a long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs, so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Why is Tezos down? Tezos (XTZ) has dropped by over 2% in the last 24 hours due to broader crypto selloffs, a break below critical levels, and low altcoin momentum. XTZ has dropped below previous support at $0.533 and remains below the 50-day SMA. XTZ price chart Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $2 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance and decentralized applications. Recent news/opinion on Tezos Tezos activates its 18th protocol upgrade, Rio, at block #8,767,488.

For that to happen, future price movements and an increase in Tezos’ adoption must be bullish. Tezos historic price sentiment Tezos price history ⏐ Source: Coinmarketcap Tezos mainnet went live in September 2018 and immediately gained popularity for dealing with the environmental impact of blockchain technologies at that time with its PoS model. XTZ’s price peaked during the bullish cycle of 2021, reaching above $9.0. After 4 April 2022, XTZ’s price plummeted below $4.0; by 9 May, it had sharply fallen below the $2 mark. XTZ surged to about $1 at the beginning of December 2022, but the bears reclaimed the market by the end of the month, resulting in a drop to $0.73. The coin recovered in 2023, averaging a market price of $0.8. Despite the partnership milestones achieved, Tezos (XTZ) had a largely bearish 2024. The coin reached a high of $1.4 in April but lost about 60% by August. The bulls soon entered the market, and XTZ saw renewed buyer interest, which resulted in a peak price of $0.7015 in September and $1.856 in November. The surge extended into December—Tezos XTZ recorded a maximum price of $1.909. Price corrections followed thereafter, and the coin closed the year at $1.286. In January 2025, XTZ reached a maximum price of $1.49, but in February, it lost momentum, averaging $0.72 per unit. After a failed attempt at breaking above $0.80 in early March, XTZ managed a high of $0.6186 in April and $0.70 in May. XTZ is currently trading between $0.5063 and $0.5384 in June.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XTZ|FORKS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-20 23:35:00

Traders scanning the altcoin landscape are beginning to identify MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the most promising under-the-radar plays of the month. As assets like Solana, Injective, Kaspa, and Uniswap maintain various levels of stability, this new project is carving out a lane of its own. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Altcoin Everyone’s Quietly Accumulating In contrast to high-profile names facing stagnation or indecision, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining momentum under the radar. With staking already live, a permanently capped supply of 170 billion tokens, and a fully audited smart contract, the project is structurally sound. But what’s really catching attention is the market behavior: holders aren’t flipping — they’re committing. The bonus entry opportunity through PATRIOTS100X has only accelerated that interest, giving small traders a clear on-ramp to participate early. Analysts and crypto circles are starting to take note — not through loud marketing pushes, but through real on-chain signals. This might just be the cycle’s biggest sleeper pick — and those who understand positioning are already getting in. Solana (SOL) Maintains Momentum Without Breakout Catalysts Solana (SOL) continues to impress with its on-chain performance. It consistently ranks among the highest in user activity and developer participation. However, despite its solid infrastructure and active ecosystem, Solana has yet to deliver a new catalyst to push the price into a breakout zone. For now, SOL remains a strong long-term hold — but traders seeking immediate upside are exploring alternatives. Injective (INJ) Remains Functional But Fades From the Spotlight Injective (INJ) is still recognized for its contributions to decentralized finance, with efficient throughput and integration into various protocols. However, its visibility has declined in recent weeks, and market activity has slowed. Without a fresh narrative or short-term trigger, INJ is losing its appeal for momentum traders chasing the next big move. Kaspa (KAS) Keeps Its Niche Appeal Kaspa (KAS) continues to operate within its unique space, offering a technically efficient network with rapid confirmation times. Still, its growth remains largely insulated, with little market-wide buzz to attract fresh capital. Traders are watching, but many have yet to see the signal to re-enter aggressively — especially when other tokens are offering stronger short-term incentives. Uniswap (UNI) Faces Uncertainty Around Governance and Utility Uniswap (UNI) retains its dominance in the DEX sector, but its native token hasn’t kept pace with user demand. Ongoing governance proposals and uncertainty around future fee structures have dampened investor enthusiasm. While platform usage remains high, UNI is struggling to define a clear reason for traders to hold or accumulate the token in the near term. Final Thoughts As projects like Solana, Injective, Kaspa, and Uniswap wrestle with limited upside and shifting sentiment, MAGACOIN FINANCE is earning a new identity — a quiet altcoin with the potential to lead the next wave. The structure is there, the behavior is aligning, and for now, the window is still open.

The US Senate on Wednesday voted 68-30 with bipartisan support in favor of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act ( GENIUS Act ), which would establish a framework for stablecoin issuers. The bill seeks to require stablecoin issuers to have full asset backing, monthly reserve disclosures and yearly audits for those with over $50 billion in market capitalization. Says pro-crypto Wyoming Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis after the passage of the bill, “Today brings us one step closer to becoming a welcoming home for digital asset companies. Now, let’s finish the job & pass market structure legislation to fulfill POTUS’ vision of becoming the crypto capital of the world.” Following the development, the shares of Circle surged by 33.82%, closing at $199. The company behind USD Coin (USDC), the second-largest stablecoin by market cap, just launched as a publicly traded company earlier this month with an initial public offering (IPO) price of $31.00 per share. Coinbase’s shares also rose by 16.32% and closed at $295.29 on Wednesday. The House of Representatives must still pass a version of the bill before the proposed legislation heads to President Donald Trump’s desk for approval.

Bitcoin’s price ticked up to around $104,000 after climbing 0.4%. It had dipped briefly to $103,000 but buyers stepped in fast.

At the same time, the US Federal Reserve held interest rates steady, keeping traders on alert for any ripple effects. Bull Market Support Band Explained Based on reports, the Bull Market Support Band sits between two key moving averages. One is a 20‑week simple moving average. The other is a 21‑week exponential moving average. Together they form a zone that Bitcoin Dominance has used as a springboard all year. When dominance tests that area, it usually bounces higher instead of dropping further. $BTC.D – As long as the Bitcoin Dominance continues to hold its Bull Market Support Band, there will be no altseason. pic.twitter.com/XCYDyuDxP2 — Luca (@CrypticTrades_) June 19, 2025 Historical Support Tests Bitcoin Dominance fell from about 56% in June 2024 to 54% in July of that year but found support. It also slipped from 58% down to 56% between late December 2024 and January 2025. Each time, the support band held firm. More recently, dominance dipped to 61% on May 14 after peaking at 65% on May 7, only to recover to 64% in a matter of days. $BTC.D – As long as the Bitcoin Dominance continues to hold its Bull Market Support Band, there are no risks of this being a distribution range for $BTC. ✅ pic.twitter.com/GS8r9jNIpB — Luca (@CrypticTrades_) June 19, 2025 Analyst Warnings And Scenarios Other experts see a different picture. Bitcoinsensus warns dominance could “fall off a cliff” before any altcoin season kicks off. That view suggests a sudden drop, maybe giving altcoins their moment. An analyst points to a possible double‑top pattern in dominance. If Bitcoin can’t clear resistance, money might flow into altcoins. But if dominance breaks higher, some believe Bitcoin could aim for a fresh record. Limitations Of Dominance Metric Dominance only measures Bitcoin’s share of total crypto market cap. It can slip if stablecoins flood in or if new tokens launch, even when altcoins aren’t rallying. And a rise in dominance can mean altcoins are selling off.

Yet relying on one technical tool can miss bigger moves driven by real‑world news or fresh blockchain data. For now, though, Bitcoin’s dominance looks safe—unless something big shifts in the weeks ahead.

Speaking via Truth Social, Trump said he should’ve never made Powell head of the Federal Reserve and once again blamed him for costing the US up to $1 trillion a year by keeping interest rates too high. He said, “Too Late Powell complains about costs, much of which were produced by the Biden Fake ‘Government.’” Trump added that Powell should cut rates to between 1% and 2% immediately. He said this would save the country massive amounts in interest payments. “That ‘numbskull’ would be saving the United States of America up to $1 Trillion Dollars per year,” Trump posted . Trump says he regrets taking advice to hire Powell The president claimed he tried “nice, neutral, and nasty” approaches to pressure Powell but said only being nasty got attention. He wrote, “He’s a dumb guy, and an obvious Trump Hater, who should have never been there.” Trump said he took bad advice when he picked Powell and said Biden made a mistake by keeping him. Trump also said inflation is no longer a concern and the economy is growing fast with factories opening and new tariffs bringing in strong revenue. He said the Fed should take advantage of this moment and drop rates. “If he was concerned about inflation or anything else, then all he has to do is bring the rate down, so we can benefit on interest costs, and raise it in the future when and if these ‘other elements’ happen (which I doubt they will!),” Trump said. The rant ended with Trump calling Powell a “total and complete moron” and saying the Federal Reserve Board should override him. He also hinted, again, that he might fire him. “Maybe, just maybe, I’ll have to change my mind about firing him? But regardless, his Term ends shortly!” Trump then posted the custom-made image of comparison below for extra theatrics: Source: Office of the President of the United States Waller pushes for July cut while others urge patience According to Reuters, this came just hours before Powell and other Fed officials spoke publicly for the first time since holding interest rates steady this week. The Fed decided to keep rates between 4.25% and 4.5% for now. Behind the scenes, policymakers are split on what to do next. Some believe inflation is still too high. Others want to cut rates soon. Christopher Waller, a Fed Governor, said Friday on CNBC that he believes inflation isn’t a real threat right now and that the Fed should move forward with cuts as early as next month. “The data the last few months has been showing that trend inflation is looking pretty good,” Waller said. He also said rising tariffs will not create serious inflation. “Any tariff inflation… I don’t think is going to be that big and we should just look through it in terms of setting policy,” he added. Waller said the Fed shouldn’t sit around and wait for the labor market to get worse. He pointed to signs of stress, including high unemployment among recent college graduates. “I’m all in favor of saying maybe we should start thinking about cutting the policy rate at the next meeting,” he said. Mary Daly, who runs the San Francisco Fed, offered a more middle-ground view. She told CNBC that a fall rate cut might make sense, but not in July. “A rate cut in the fall would be more appropriate,” she said, unless the labor market weakens faster than expected. She also warned that tariffs could push up costs but said businesses might absorb the hit instead of passing it to buyers. Daly warned against rushing into cuts without solid data. But she said the Fed also can’t ignore how much the economy is cooling. “We cannot wait so long that we forget that the fundamentals of the economy are moving in a direction where an interest rate adjustment might be necessary,” Daly said. The latest projections from the Fed show a near 50-50 split. Eight officials expect two rate cuts this year. Seven think there should be none. Those expecting cuts believe the September and December meetings could be the moments to act. The rest want to keep things where they are.

Bitcoin (BTC) remains the market’s anchor, but attention is quickly shifting to innovative projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE , Ethereum (ETH), Optimism (OP), Aptos (APT), and Chainlink (LINK). With speculative momentum building, the hunt for the next big winner is on. Benchmark Achievement: MAGACOIN FINANCE’s Rapid Capital Inflow Setting a new benchmark in the crypto presale arena, MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly raised over $10 million, reflecting robust investor confidence.

46442693,https://timestabloid.com/?p=71793,1750465840,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Google Gemini Predicts Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price for July 1, 2025",https://timestabloid.com/google-gemini-predicts-shiba-inu-shib-price-for-july-1-2025/,"As the crypto market navigates another wave of uncertainty, attention has turned to Shiba Inu (SHIB), the popular meme coin currently trading between $0.0000117 and $0.000012 as of June 20, 2025. With July just nine days away, investors and enthusiasts alike are curious about what lies ahead. To provide a data-informed forecast, we turned to Google Gemini, one of the most advanced AI models, to predict SHIB’s potential price movement by July 1, 2025, based on recent technical and market trends. SHIB’s Current Market Landscape Over the last month, SHIB has experienced a noticeable decline, dropping between 19% and 21%. Even over the past week, the asset has shown a slight downturn, ranging from 0.7% to 11%. Despite this bearish stretch, SHIB appears to be holding its ground above a key support level near $0.000011. This has led to early signs of buyer accumulation, as traders begin to see potential value at current price levels. A notable development on SHIB’s price chart is the emergence of a falling wedge pattern, a structure commonly viewed as a precursor to a bullish breakout. Meanwhile, order book data from exchanges shows that buy orders currently outweigh sell orders—another subtle indicator of a possible trend reversal forming beneath the surface. Technical Barriers and Bearish Pressure Despite encouraging signs of accumulation, SHIB still faces significant technical resistance. It remains below its 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day moving averages—both simple and exponential—levels that typically mark bearish dominance. There’s also concern that a death cross may be forming, a signal that occurs when short-term averages cross below long-term ones, often interpreted as a warning of continued downward momentum. At this point, market sentiment around SHIB is largely described as “neutral” to “bearish.” Traders appear cautious, awaiting a clear technical or fundamental catalyst to shift the short-term outlook. Google Gemini’s Price Forecast for July 1, 2025 Using all of this recent data, Google Gemini provided three distinct price projections based on possible short-term market outcomes: Conservative Scenario: Stabilization Without a Catalyst In a muted environment where no significant market-wide or SHIB-specific catalyst appears, Gemini suggests SHIB may continue consolidating above its current support. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Price action is expected to remain range-bound, possibly reclaiming minor resistance around $0.000012 but lacking the momentum to push significantly higher. In this case, the price is likely to hover between $0.000012 and $0.0000125. Moderate Scenario: Technical Recovery Begins In this scenario, the falling wedge begins to play out as a bullish reversal, with accumulation strengthening and perhaps minor positive developments within the Shiba Inu ecosystem, such as updates to Shibarium adding momentum. If SHIB can begin reclaiming some of its moving averages, Google Gemini projects a modest yet meaningful move higher, placing the expected price range between $0.0000125 and $0.000014 by July 1. Bullish Scenario: Breakout Triggered by Major Catalyst A stronger, more optimistic outcome would require a significant trigger, such as a large token burn, a breakthrough development in Shibarium, or an overall rally in the crypto market, especially led by Bitcoin and Ethereum. In such a case, SHIB would likely break decisively from the falling wedge, push above the 200-day EMA, and aim to reclaim the highs it saw earlier in May or June. Under these conditions, Gemini forecasts the price could rise sharply to anywhere between $0.0000145 and $0.000017. Final Thoughts Shiba Inu’s path over the next nine days remains closely tied to both technical structures and broader market behavior. While current trends lean slightly bearish, underlying signals such as buyer interest and chart patterns suggest the possibility of a short-term recovery. Ultimately, according to Google Gemini, SHIB’s price by July 1 will depend heavily on whether accumulation continues, resistance levels are broken, and any fresh catalyst ignites momentum. In a quiet market, SHIB may remain stable with modest gains. But if the right conditions align, the meme coin could surprise traders with a sharp upside move.

While legacy assets like XRP, Cardano, TRON, and Litecoin maintain their positions, it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE and Solana that are emerging as leaders in this new wave of market momentum. Bitcoin (BTC) Cools After Recent Rally Bitcoin has taken a step back this week, consolidating after weeks of bullish action. Without a strong macroeconomic catalyst or breakout headline, BTC appears to be in a pause phase. Many investors are holding long-term, but traders looking for faster ROI are rotating out of Bitcoin and into assets showing more immediate traction and structural benefits. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Where Smart Traders Are Moving Now While older assets tread water, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining strong traction — and doing so with substance behind the hype. Here’s why it’s drawing capital quickly: 170B Fixed Supply: No future dilution or inflation. Staking Is Live: Traders can lock in passive rewards while holding. HashEx-Audited: The project has cleared a full security audit. No VC Control: Community-driven, with zero centralized ownership traps. On-Chain Strength: Wallet growth and long-hold behaviors continue to rise. Bonus Offer Active: The PATRIOTS100X bonus gives early buyers extra leverage before listings arrive. As the broader market steadies, MAGACOIN FINANCE is proving it has more than potential — it has the behavior, structure, and timing that typically precede breakout runs. Solana (SOL) Sustains Ecosystem Leadership Solana continues to rank among the most active blockchains by daily transactions and user activity. Its thriving ecosystem across NFTs, gaming, and decentralized apps has helped it remain relevant even in market lulls. While SOL hasn’t posted a dramatic price jump recently, its steady technical strength keeps it high on the list for altcoin exposure. XRP Eyes Resolution But Moves Cautiously XRP is still waiting on regulatory clarity, with the joint motion to release $125 million from escrow signaling that the SEC case may soon reach its conclusion. While this has sparked optimism, traders remain cautious due to the token’s sensitivity to legal headlines. The potential for an ETF or integration with SWIFT remains, but timing remains uncertain, prompting some capital outflow into earlier-stage coins. Cardano (ADA) Faces Community Confidence, Price Hesitation Cardano continues to build through its developer community, with founder Charles Hoskinson maintaining visibility. Still, ADA’s price remains closely tied to the overall market and has not generated its own breakout narrative in this cycle. It remains a long-term favorite, but in the short term, its momentum is flat, causing some traders to explore alternatives. TRON (TRX) Keeps Stability But Lacks Excitement TRON remains a strong network for stablecoins and high-frequency transactions, and Justin Sun continues to push updates and global partnerships. However, TRX hasn’t seen much volatility or growth this month. It is viewed as a stable layer, but traders looking for explosive upside are rotating to assets with more dynamic incentive models. Litecoin (LTC) Struggles for Relevance Litecoin has historically been called the silver to Bitcoin’s gold, but recent market activity has left LTC in the background. Without new technical developments or major ecosystem updates, it’s seen largely as a legacy hold — not a growth vehicle — and traders are beginning to overlook it during active rotation cycles. Final Thoughts Bitcoin is taking a well-earned pause, and while Solana maintains strong traction, it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE that is turning heads for those chasing early-entry upside. Meanwhile, XRP, Cardano, TRON, and Litecoin continue to hold their lanes — but lack the same urgency or structure that’s driving attention toward this new contender.

46444035,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=775439,1750467626,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/46444035.jpeg,Analyst Warns Of XRP Trap — „You’re Being Played”,https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/analyst-warns-of-xrp-trap-youre-being-played/,"CryptoInsightUK’s latest market briefing arrives with the sound of literal hammer blows next door, an accidental soundtrack to the pounding he expects traders to take before the next rally. In a thirteen–minute walkthrough of XRP, Bitcoin and Ethereum liquidity maps, the British analyst argues that the market is staging what he calls “a deliberate trap” designed to flush out weak hands, harvest stop-loss orders and maximise upside leverage for larger players—leaving retail participants “screaming, ‘Yay, we’re going to the upside,’ … only to find out they’ve been played.” The Trap Is Set, Warns XRP Trader He begins with XRP’s five-month down-channel that started at the New-Year peak, noting that price continues to hug the underside of a descending trend line. “We’re stuck below that trend line basically looking to see if this liquidity is going to get taken below us. My obvious opinion is that it is,” he says, underscoring the conviction that a sweep of resting bids below remains the path of least resistance. The flush, he contends, would “make our journey to the upside much better and much easier to navigate,” because it would reset funding, scare out late longs and reload the order book for what he still calls the next “parabolic expansion probably up towards the $8 to $12 region.” Related Reading: ‘Out of Time’: XRP Consolidation Hits Final Moment, Analyst Alerts The trap, however, may not be a straightforward vertical collapse. Charts, he reminds viewers, “love doing something like” an initial breakout that rallies 15-20%, convinces traders the bear-phase is finished, and then abruptly reverses into the deep liquidity pocket below. “That’s exactly how higher-highs-and-higher-lows type situations are supposed to get you frustrated,” he says, openly conceding that the pattern looks engineered. The phrase he never uses—manipulation—hovers unspoken over the analysis, but his rhetoric leaves little doubt: “This is how they test everybody.” Bitcoin, in his narrative, may serve as the decoy that sets the trap. The benchmark asset has already slipped out of its own wedge-like consolidation and, he observes, “does like to do this sort of thing” by staging premature upside breaks. He sketches a possible march toward $115,000 that would “delay the inevitable” and then give way to a liquidity hunt of its own. Even so, his mid-cycle price band for Bitcoin remains $150,000 to $220,000. That upside, he argues, justifies dollar-cost-averaging into altcoins even while keeping “a tiny bit of dry powder” in reserve for the washout he expects. Related Reading: XRP 5-Wave Count Shows When The Price Will Hit All-Time Highs Above $5 A more elaborate scenario involves a temporary dominance surge in Bitcoin to the 66 to 74% range. As Bitcoin siphons capital, alts such as XRP would “bleed out,” take the downside liquidity target, and only then reverse as cash rotates back into their order books. He illustrates the dance on twin TradingView panels—Bitcoin on the left, XRP on the right—before concluding that the rotational setup is “not highly likely” because it requires several macro-scale dominoes to fall in sequence. Still, he refuses to dismiss it, pointing to the strategic reserve bill in Washington as the sort of narrative catalyst that could spark a temporary Bitcoin-only rally and demoralise alt-holders. Macro-risk flickers through the commentary—wars that could “shove us down” in the near term—but he treats geopolitical stress as a catalyst for final capitulation rather than a thesis-killer. “The upside is so large it almost can’t be ignored,” he insists, framing the present chop as a high-volatility pause before a structural up-leg. Whether that leg begins only after a full flush or emerges from yet another fake-out remains uncertain, but the analyst’s message is unmistakable: traders who chase breakouts without accounting for hidden hands risk being liquidated first, spectators to the parabola they hoped to ride. For now he is content to wait “for the market to do its worst trick,” believing that the final shakeout will announce itself through a sudden, depth-piercing wick. “You’re being played,” he warns. The admonition is stark: if the playbook unfolds as expected, the pain will be quick. “If we get these levels, that’s where I’m putting the last bit of my dry powder in. It’s $1.80-ish, $1.90 maybe.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.16.

XRP is holding near $2.17 with short-term resistance limiting any real breakout. Meanwhile, Dogecoin has slipped below key support, with some traders now watching $0.12 as the next possible floor. BlockDAG, on the other hand, is already doing the work. With $313.5 million raised, over 22.9 billion coins sold, and miners shipping from July 7, this project is not sitting still. Unlike XRP and DOGE, BlockDAG isn’t hoping for momentum; it’s building it. With the presale still active at $0.0018 until June 20, it is the best crypto to buy today. XRP Holds the Line as $3 Target Draws Closer XRP is hovering around $2.17, with most analysts expecting a small pullback of around 2.7% in the short term. However, forecasts from major platforms like Binance and Kraken hint at a potential move toward the $2.26 to $2.30 range within weeks. The real challenge lies in breaking above near-term resistance, which could open the door to the $3 zone if momentum builds. Longer-term projections are far more ambitious, with some putting XRP between $2.75 and $5.78 by 2030. A favourable resolution in Ripple’s SEC case could trigger a fast rally. Until then, XRP is staying in position, potentially coiling up for a breakout. Dogecoin Flashes Warning Signs, But $0.20 Still in Sight Dogecoin is currently trading near $0.175, with recent drops testing support levels around $0.168. If that zone fails, analysts are watching for deeper moves toward $0.12 or even $0.093. The decline mirrors broader crypto weakness, but DOGE’s connection to market sentiment remains strong. Forecasts suggest a potential bounce to $0.206 by mid-July if support holds. Traders are cautious, but the setup could flip quickly. With no clear catalyst yet, the question is whether DOGE is resting before a reversal or bracing for another slide. All eyes are on the chart for the next spark. BlockDAG Hits Mid-Presale Milestone with $313M Raised and Miner Rollout Scheduled BlockDAG’s mid-presale stage is shaping up as the strongest entry point so far. With major updates rolling out before exchange listings, the timing is strategic. On June 20, BlockDAG will reveal a major U.S. sponsorship designed to expand brand visibility across key markets. Just weeks later, the X30 and X100 mining rigs began shipping on July 7, followed by the X10 release on August 15. All of this happens while the coin is still in presale, giving early participants a window to move ahead of broader market pricing. Founder Antony Turner has locked in a plan to delay exchange listings until the $600 million presale goal is met. That strategy gives the network room to build while keeping new entrants focused on utility, not hype. With $313.5 million already secured and 22.9 billion coins sold, BlockDAG is well past the halfway mark, and traction is accelerating fast. Over 2 million mobile users are mining BDAG daily through the X1 app, adding organic strength to the project. The current Batch 29 price sits at $0.0276, but a limited $0.0018 offer is still available. That early access price gives participants a steep advantage over later stages, especially once the final batch countdown begins. Each batch locks in a higher rate, increasing the potential return for those who entered earlier. With a roadmap grounded in real delivery, confirmed hardware shipping dates, and a presale that funds long-term infrastructure, BlockDAG is turning heads for all the right reasons. This is not just another launch. It is a working ecosystem in mid-build, and the timing could not be sharper. What The Future Holds The XRP price forecast shows little urgency, with movement hinging on legal updates, while Dogecoin is testing support without a clear catalyst in sight. Both assets remain stuck in neutral, prompting attention to shift toward projects that are actively building. BlockDAG stands out by doing exactly that. With its $313.5 million presale halfway to the $600 million goal and major rollouts set for June 20, July 7, and August 15, the network is delivering before it lists. The $0.0018 offer is still active, but until June 20. This mid-phase window could be the last major entry before the momentum fully takes off.

Crypto exchanges would be asked to provide the identities of individuals belonging to a company that issues tokens under the proposal. This announcement is intended to assist the SEC in monitoring and investigating possible insider trading activity , a serious problem for the increasingly international digital asset market. The action is a part of Thailand’s continued development of crypto regulation. The country has tried to promote and clamp down on the industry recently. Among these were plans announced in May to open the country to tourists to use cryptocurrencies, signalling a greater willingness to adopt digital assets. But just days later, authorities closed off access to the crypto exchanges OKX and Bybit, citing unlicensed activities and money laundering concerns. Thailand courts global crypto investors with bold 5-Year tax break Just a few days ago, Thailand scrapped capital gains taxes on cryptocurrency sales for five years, in its boldest move yet to become a leading global hub for digital assets. The Thai Cabinet approved the tax exemption, waiving personal income taxes on profits from crypto sales through licensed digital asset service providers. The policy will take effect from January 1, 2025, through December 31, 2029. Deputy Finance Minister Julapun Amornvivat called the decision a pivotal step toward Thailand’s vision of becoming “one of the world’s financial hubs.” The government hopes the tax break will draw crypto firms and investors away from established centers like Singapore and Dubai, cementing Thailand’s place on the global digital finance map. Thailand continues to position itself as “one of the first countries in the world to implement laws governing digital assets and related taxation,” according to Deputy Finance Minister Julapun Amornvivat. The government expects the new tax exemption to deliver strong economic returns, with the Finance Ministry projecting that crypto assets could expand the Thai economy and boost tax revenues by at least 1 billion baht (approximately $30.7 million) over the medium term. Industry analysts believe the potential upside may be even greater, citing Thailand’s status as home to Southeast Asia’s second-largest concentration of crypto holders. “Thailand crypto HODLers are holding $180 billion, and clear regulations and tax reforms will help people to hold more crypto assets,” Jagdish Pandya, founder of Blockon Ventures and organizer of Thai Blockchain Week 2019. Thailand’s crypto reforms aim to boost market confidence The latest regulatory push also appears to be informed by past incidents. In 2022, Thailand faced its own insider trading scandal when the SEC accused the CTO of Bitkub—one of the country’s largest crypto exchanges—of using confidential information to profit from token sales ahead of a major deal. Insider trading, defined as buying or selling securities based on non-public information, is widely considered illegal across financial markets. Enforcement in the crypto space has gained momentum globally. In 2021, OpenSea’s former Head of Product, Nate Chastain, was charged and later convicted for front-running NFT listings on the platform, receiving a three-month prison sentence. Similarly, three former Coinbase employees were indicted in 2022, with two serving time for leveraging non-public token listing details. More recently, Binance suspended a staff member in March following an investigation into alleged insider trading, and blockchain analysts have flagged suspicious trading activity related to US President Donald Trump’s memecoin (TRUMP), prompting speculation of insider behavior. Thailand’s SEC says the consultation period will give the public a chance to weigh in on how best to structure the issuance of utility tokens and prevent illicit practices in an increasingly complex market.

The altcoin is now up by 1.5% in a week but down by 8% in a month, following weeks of escalating tension in the Middle East and little progress with regards to international tariffs. That said, XRP retains a strong 335% increase in the past year, while analysts are beginning to suggest that the coin nearing a pivotal tipping point. This could be in either direction, however, although XRP’s fundamentals have become increasingly strong in recent weeks, pointing to a very positive long-term price prediction . XRP Price Prediction: Analyst Declares ‘Only Two Paths Remain’ as XRP Tightens to Breaking Point Posting on X, analyst CasiTrades wrote that XRP’s “consolidation has finally reached its apex and something big is coming next.” Unfortunately, she suggested that a big dive is more or less as likely as a breakout, so traders may need to tread very carefully in deciding whether to buy or sell. The market is officially out of time! After months of tightening, the #XRP consolidation has finally reached its apex and something big is coming next. There are only two paths from here: either the explosive breakout we've been waiting for begins now, or we see one final… pic.twitter.com/xGRyaevRxX — CasiTrades (@CasiTrades) June 18, 2025 The main point of her analysis was that, if XRP struggles to break through $2.25 for much longer, it could slide to lower levels, to $2.00 or “even $1.55.” However, she may have invalidated her analysis to some degree by suggesting, a reply to her own post , that to “be clear, I do think we’ll get that drop to support today or tomorrow.” This did not happen, with the XRP price hanging around the same $2.15 level it had on the day (Wednesday) she made these predictions. If we look at XRP’s chart today, we see that the coin’s resistance (red) and support (green) are indeed converging to a point where a big move may arrive. As for the other indicators, they suggest that the altcoin remains in an oversold position, which would imply a strong rebound. Source: TradingView Its RSI (purple) has been below 50 for much of the time since February, while its moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is also in an oversold space. So given that XRP remains one of the strongest coins in the market in terms of fundamentals, it should pick up again strongly soon, assuming that t he Israel-Iran conflict doesn’t escalate further . With listed firms buying up XRP , with XRP ETFs on the way, and with Ripple expanding its business , the XRP price could easily reach $2.50 by the end of July and $3 by September. Bitcoin Hyper Gains Momentum with $1.4 Million Presale: Next 100x Coin? XRP continues to be a very strong altcoin, but traders should always consider diversifying into newer tokens, allocating a small percentage of their portfolios to coins that may show strong volatility. This should include presale tokens, which can often rally big when they list for the first time, especially if they’ve had successful raises. And one sale gaining steam right now belongs to Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER), an Ethereum- and Solana-based tokensed that has raised just over $1.4 million in its ICO. Bitcoin Hyper is quickly gaining momentum because of its exciting plans to launch a layer-two network for Bitcoin, providing the latter with a big boost in speed and scalability. It will make use of zero-knowledge proofs to provide greater efficiency and security, while it will also harness Ethereum and Solana virtual machines to achieve its greater throughput. On top of this, it’s planning to provide a platform for DEXes and DeFi applications, so that a thriving DeFi ecosystem can build on top of the Bitcoin base layer. Its native token HYPER will be necessary to pay for transactions, meaning that demand for the token will grow in step with the platform’s growth. Holders will also be able to stake it for a passive income, with investors able to buy it now by going to the Bitcoin Hyper website . It’s currently selling for $0.01195, although this will rise again later today.

The community has been disappointed by a lack of updates and further ecosystem growth initiatives from the Pi Core Team since the launch of the public mainnet. Even the most die-hard supporters have emphasized that Pi could continue to drop to $0.40 unless the developing team makes some sort of positive announcement during a widely awaited event called Two-Pi Day or “ Tau Day ” that is scheduled to take place on June 28. During this event, the team could unveil its latest efforts to further expand the Pi Network ecosystem. Data from PiScan shows that 263 million Pi tokens worth approximately $143 million will be unlocked this month. This is the highest monthly volume that will be added to Pi’s supply until September 2027 when another 310 million tokens will be released. Apart from the downtrend caused by rising tensions in the Middle East, this could also be one of the causes why Pi has declined so sharply lately. Despite this recent weakness, the community still believes that some solid announcements on Pi Day could favor a bullish Pi price forecast . Pi Coin Price Prediction: Pi Could Rise to $0.60 If This Happens Pi has already hit a key resistance in the past few hours at around $0.55. This is the most critical resistance to watch for the token as a break above would confirm an upcoming push to $0.57 in the near term. The 9-period exponential moving average (EMA) has jumped above its 21-period peer. This is a buy signal known as a ‘golden cross’ that confirms a change in momentum and in the direction of the price trend. Next up, the $0.57 level will be the key resistance to overcome for bulls and this is an area of confluence where the 200-period EMA stands as well. If Pi breaks above this level, it would favor a bullish Pi Coin price prediction that sees the token rising to $0.60. Meanwhile, any big announcement on Pi Day could cause the token to rise to at least $1 per coin as the community will be expecting a significant move if the team shares some exciting news. Whether it is PI or other cryptocurrency, storing your tokens safely is a key priority. A new crypto presale called Best Wallet (BEST) offers a robust and innovative Web 3 crypto wallet that includes attractive features and tools. Best Wallet (BEST) Prepares to Wrap Up Its Successful Presale With More Than $13M Raised Best Wallet (BEST) is a powerful Web 3 storage solution that offers access to the most innovative tools to help investors identify new opportunities in the marketplaces. This wallet supports assets from more than 60 blockchains and low fees for token swaps. In addition, the developing team has created a tool called ‘Upcoming Tokens’ that allows investors to identify the most promising crypto presales. It has already spotted some successful offerings like Pepe Unchained (PEPU) and MIND of Pepe (MIND). As this solution is embraced by the crypto community, the demand for its utility token, $BEST will skyrocket. Hence, early buyers who take advantage of its discounted presale price stand to reap the highest returns. To buy $BEST, simply head to the Best Wallet website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH for this token or use a bank card to invest.

While Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to trade steadily around $0.17, showing resilience during recent volatility, it’s Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that is fueling the biggest wave of speculation. Mutuum Finance is in phase 5 of its presale. Over $10.8 million has already been raised and more than 12,200 investors have joined. Analysts tracking top summer crypto trends are highlighting Mutuum Finance’s blend of real-world DeFi integration and early-stage momentum as a formula that could set it apart from other low-cost coins.

Phase 5 Ignites: Mutuum Finance Presale at $0.03 Mutuum Finance is lighting up the DeFi sector, and Phase 5 of its presale is flying along with tokens still at just $0.03. With a launch price of $0.06, investors in today can look to enjoy a seamless 2x profit. But it doesn’t stop there, with an estimated gain of 1200% after launch, this may be one of the biggest DeFi plays going on right now. Over $10.8 million has already been raised and more than 12,200 investors are on hold and ready to ride. To make things even sweeter, the next presale round takes the price to $0.035, so anyone who invests now will capture an instant 16.67% profit. The opportunity to realize these profits is rapidly fading, and astute money is already moving.

Bitcoin (BTC) continues to set the pace with record institutional inflows, while Solana (SOL) is drawing bullish forecasts from experts. Now, MAGACOIN FINANCE is joining this elite group, rapidly gaining traction as one of the most promising altcoins for the year. With Cardano (ADA), NEAR Protocol (NEAR), Kaspa (KAS), and Arbitrum (ARB) also in focus, the market is primed for dynamic moves. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Setting New Standards for Altcoin Launches MAGACOIN FINANCE is making waves in 2025 after raising over $10 million in its limited-access pre-sale. With a capped supply, bold branding, and a full audit by HashEx, the project is gaining serious traction. Investors can double their holdings using promo code PATRIOTS100X—analysts expect major upside ahead of its public launch. Momentum is building fast across social platforms, with growing interest from both retail and early-stage backers. Many now view MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the year’s most compelling altcoin opportunities. Bitcoin (BTC): Institutional Inflows and New Highs Bitcoin is riding a wave of institutional adoption and record spot ETF inflows, with leading analysts forecasting a 2025 top between $180,000 and $250,000. As BTC continues to break new ground, it remains the market’s anchor and a key benchmark for bullish sentiment. Solana (SOL): Bullish Patterns and Expert Forecasts Solana is working on a bullish cup and handle pattern, with seven reputable experts predicting 2025 highs ranging from $220 to $1,000 and an average target of $515. Ecosystem expansion and the potential for ETF approval are driving optimism, keeping SOL among the top bullish picks. Cardano (ADA): DeFi Growth and Layer-2 Upgrades Cardano is forecasted to reach as high as $5.66 in 2025, supported by DeFi adoption, scaling solutions like Hydra, and growing institutional interest. ADA’s innovative approach and network upgrades are drawing attention from both retail and professional investors. NEAR Protocol (NEAR): Steady Growth Outlook NEAR Protocol is projected to reach $2.91 by the end of 2025, with a cumulative ROI of +18% and a long-term outlook for continued ecosystem development. As NEAR’s fundamentals strengthen, it remains a steady pick for diversified portfolios. Kaspa (KAS): Volatility and High Potential Kaspa’s price could range from $0.08 to $0.65 in 2025, with some analysts predicting up to 620% gains if bullish momentum holds. Its unique consensus mechanism and growing adoption keep KAS on the radar for high-risk, high-reward traders. Arbitrum (ARB): Layer-2 Leadership Arbitrum continues to lead Layer-2 solutions for Ethereum, with ongoing upgrades and ecosystem growth supporting its long-term value proposition. As ARB’s adoption expands, it remains a favorite among DeFi-focused investors.

46445559,https://cryptonews.com/?p=373537,1750469688,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/46445559.jpeg,Pepe Price Prediction: This Rare MVRV Signal Just Flashed — Why Traders Are Paying Close Attention,https://cryptonews.com/news/pepe-price-prediction-this-rare-mvrv-signal-just-flashed-why-traders-are-paying-close-attention/,"The Pepe price (PEPE) has gone down by 3.3% in the past 7 days as meme coins have taken a significant hit during the latest downturn. Some on-chain metrics appear to be favoring a bearish Pepe price prediction as whales are abandoning the ship and taking losses along the way. The number of “in the money” wallets that hold PEPE has declined recently by 7%, meaning that many investors are currently sitting on losses. Meanwhile, large transaction volumes have dropped by 5%, suggesting that whales’ activity has been diminishing. Finally, the MVRV Z-score, which measures the portion of crypto wallets holding PEPE that are currently under water, has reached negative levels and has been dropping since late May. When this metric is in negative territory and stands there for too long, it could indicate that whales are capitulating and taking losses as they sell, possibly as their expectations about the token’s upside potential in the near future are changing. The armed conflict between Iran and Israel could have contributed to this dynamic. PEPE Could Still Rise to $0.00001300 If It Bounces Off This Support Looking at PEPE’s 4-hour chart, we can already identify the token’s key area of support. The $0.00001000 level seems to be the most critical threshold to watch as investors wait for the next catalyst to decide what to do with their tokens. A break below could risk a big drop to the $0.00000800 area. As seen earlier in the article, on-chain data suggests that bearish momentum is gaining traction. However, this latest drop could also open up the door for whales to start accumulating tokens once again at this lower price of $0.00001000. A break above $0.000011 will likely push the token to the $0.00001300 area in the near term. However, PEPE’s daily short-term exponential moving averages (EMAs) are not yet support a bullish Pepe price prediction. A ‘golden cross’ between the 9-day and 21-day EMAs would confirm this bullish outlook in the near term. In this lower time frame, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has moved above the 14-day moving average which signals that positive momentum is building up. Meme coins in the Solana ecosystem have been increasing their market value lately despite the market’s overall negative sentiment. To help the Solana blockchain keep up with rising transaction volumes, a new layer-2 scaling solution called Solaxy (SOLX) has emerged and its crypto presale is finally coming to an end after raising $55 million. Solaxy Prepares for Mainnet Launch in 3 Days Solaxy (SOLX) aims to eliminate the congestion issues that the Solana blockchain has experienced during peak usage periods. This is achieved through a side chain that bundles transactions offline before sending them to the mainnet to increase the efficiency of every block. The developing has made significant progress to launch the L2 and plans to release the mainnet in early July just a couple of weeks after Solaxy’s presale ends. As the utility token of this solution, $SOLX could skyrocket once top wallets and exchanges start to adopt Solaxy. In addition, the project offers attractive staking rewards of 76%. To buy $SOLX at its discounted price before the presale event ends, head to the Solaxy website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or SOL or use a bank card to make your investment.

46446881,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=751951,1750470989,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/46446881.jpeg,Apple in legal trouble after postponing Siri updates until 2026,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/apple-sued-by-shareholders/,"Apple investors filed a lawsuit against the tech firm in a proposed class action for securities fraud on Friday, June 20. The shareholders accuse the company of overstating the maturity and readiness of its “Apple Intelligence” AI features—especially those tied to the Siri voice assistant—during its June 2024 Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). They claimed that the iPhone maker minimized the time it would take to add advanced artificial intelligence to its Siri voice assistant , negatively affecting iPhone sales and lowering its stock price. The lawsuit includes shareholders who lost hundreds of billions of dollars in the year ending June 9, after the tech firm unveiled several features and aesthetic changes to its products but kept its AI changes modest. Apple finds itself in trouble after postponing some Siri updates until 2026 In their statement, shareholders led by Eric Tucker said they were convinced at the June 2024 WWDC conference that AI would emerge as a key driver in future iPhone 16 devices . This followed the launch of Apple Intelligence in a bid to make Siri, Apple’s intelligent personal assistant, a more powerful and user-friendly product. However, they said the Cupertino, California-based company did not have a working model for AI-based Siri features. They felt it was unlikely that these features would be ready in time for the iPhone 16s. Shareholders noted that the truth started to come out on March 7 when Apple postponed some Siri updates until 2026. This feeling continued during this year’s Worldwide Developers Conference on June 9, where Apple’s view of its AI advancements did not meet analysts’ expectations. Meanwhile, since reaching a record high on December 26, 2024, the tech firm’s shares have dropped by almost 25%, resulting in a loss of about $900 billion in market value. The case is Tucker v. Apple Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 25-05197. Notably, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook, Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh, and former CFO Luca Maestri are defendants in the case, filed in San Francisco federal court. The iPhone maker did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Apple unveiled plans for new AI features for future improvement Earlier, Apple unveiled several new artificial intelligence features, including a modest update to its software and services that shares the basic technology behind Apple Intelligence. This move had set the stage for future improvements. The announcements at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference were more about a series of small improvements. This included live translations for phone calls, which improve everyday life instead of the big plans for AI that Apple’s rivals are using to promote themselves. Interestingly, a year after it could not deliver promised AI-based upgrades to important products, including Siri, the tech firm has been careful about its AI promises to users, letting them know that it can assist with tasks like locating where to purchase a jacket similar to one they spotted online. Behind the scenes, Apple hinted at a plan to provide its own tools to developers alongside those from competitors. This strategy was similar to Microsoft’s last month. Craig Federighi, a senior vice president of software engineering at Apple, said the company will provide both its own and OpenAI’s code completion tools in its key Apple developer software, and that the company is opening up the foundation AI model that it uses for some of its own features to third-party developers. According to Federighi, they make connecting directly to the large language model on Apple devices easier. In an early example of this feature, the company integrated image generation from OpenAI’s ChatGPT into its Image Playground app. They assured users that their data would not be shared with OpenAI unless they agreed. Ben Bajarin, CEO of analyst firm Creative Strategies, commented on the situation. Bajarin explained that one can see that Apple focuses on developing behind the scenes rather than what users see on the surface, which, according to him, most people are not really concerned about. The iPhone maker encountered unique technical and regulatory challenges as its software developer conference began.

Traders are actively seeking alternatives with stronger reward mechanics and early-stage upside — and MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly rising as a direct competitor. As XRP, Injective, and Bitcoin Cash move through mixed phases, investors are watching for where the next breakout could emerge. Ethereum (ETH) Maintains Strong Institutional Momentum Ethereum (ETH) continues to gain support from both retail and institutional players. Optimism around an ETH spot ETF has helped push sentiment higher, and the network remains a leader in smart contract innovation. Treasury allocations into ETH-based products are growing, but some traders believe the asset’s upside is already priced in — and are rotating into smaller caps with more aggressive ROI potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Fast Growth Fueled by Smart Positioning MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging not just as a high-upside opportunity — but as a project built for strategic investors. While Ethereum dominates headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is winning traders over with its internal structure and on-chain behavior. Early adopters aren’t just speculating — they’re staking, accumulating, and building conviction. Here’s what’s driving the surge: Fixed Supply of 170B Tokens – No inflation risk, creating long-term value. Staking Fully Live – Passive income is already rewarding holders. Audited by HashEx – Technical trust is in place from the start. Zero VC Oversight – Full decentralization appeals to serious traders. Accumulation Trends – Wallets are growing, and sell pressure is low. PATRIOTS100X Bonus – Adds further incentive for new entries. This combination of technical clarity and incentive strength is turning MAGACOIN FINANCE from a niche play into a core part of many high-conviction portfolios. XRP Edges Toward Clarity, But Volatility Persists XRP is in a complex holding pattern. While the legal situation with the SEC is progressing toward resolution — with $125 million potentially being released from escrow — traders remain split on short-term performance. The possibility of an XRP ETF and cross-border utility keeps long-term interest alive, but short-term confidence is weaker as the market waits for clarity. Injective (INJ) Still Strong on Fundamentals, Weak on Activity Injective (INJ) has built a solid foundation within decentralized finance infrastructure. Yet despite its strong protocol integrations and real-world use cases, price activity has been lackluster. There hasn’t been a clear event or news catalyst in the recent cycle to reignite strong trading volume, leading many momentum-focused investors to look elsewhere for faster-moving opportunities. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Returns to the Fringes Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has seen a resurgence in some corners of the crypto world, but the move has been largely sentiment-driven. Without meaningful innovation or fresh ecosystem development, BCH remains a legacy asset that struggles to attract long-term conviction. Its recent rally has faded, and traders are once again rotating out in favor of more modern alternatives. Final Thoughts Ethereum may still command the spotlight, but MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining real momentum with a structure that supports rapid growth. As XRP, Injective, and Bitcoin Cash face individual headwinds, traders looking for early-entry potential and strategic upside are finding a new home in MAGACOIN FINANCE.

Trading has thinned out this week, and Dogecoin has slipped almost 3% over the past seven days. Based on reports, investors are moving carefully as volume dropped 30% to about $678 million. Related Reading: Iran’s Top Crypto Hub Loses $82 Million To Hackers With Israeli Links—Details Trading Volume Drop Signals Caution According to on‑chain data, the slump in daily volume shows fewer traders are stepping in. That 34% slide in activity suggests a loss of momentum. Some market watchers say low volume often leads to whipsaws. When fewer coins change hands, even modest buys or sells can push prices sharply in either direction. #Dogecoin $DOGE looks prime for a 60% price move! All you need to do is wait for a daily close outside of the $0.16 to $0.22 range to determine the direction of the trend.

Prices have carved lower highs and higher lows as trendlines converge. Data from crypto analyst Ali shows, this narrowing range often precedes a major move. He notes the tip of the triangle is due by June 2025, which puts a deadline on when volatility should pick up. DOGE Bulls Eye Breakout According to Ali’s analysis, a daily close above $0.22 likely signals a bullish breakout. If that happens, he sees Dogecoin reaching roughly $0.35 or $0.36—about 60% higher than current levels. On the flip side, a drop below $0.16 could spark a sell‑off toward $0.10. Investors are watching those exact levels to decide whether to join buyers or cut losses. DOGE Price Forecast Digital Coin Price is on the optimistic end. They predict Dogecoin could go past $0.37 before year‑end and even test its old high of $0.74 again. Market Catalysts Could Tip The Scales Dogecoin’s swings often mirror the wider crypto space or follow social media buzz. A surge in Bitcoin or Ethereum prices could carry DOGE higher, while a broader sell‑off would magnify losses. Some traders also keep an eye on endorsements from well‑known figures and major exchange listings. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears Climax, But A Twist Awaits—Analyst Reveals Key Insight For now, patience may pay off. Traders will look for volume to confirm any move past $0.22 or under $0.16. Until then, expect choppy range‑bound action. The next few weeks will be critical as the symmetrical triangle tightens. If volume steps back in, Dogecoin could pick a clear direction—either a strong rally or a deeper correction.

But this isn’t just about raising funds for the show. BlockDAG (BDAG) has already crossed $313 million, showing strong support for its long-term roadmap. Every dollar from this presale supports real goals. Instead of throwing funds at flashy marketing, the focus is on growing the chain’s capabilities and utility. In a crypto space often driven by hype and short-lived pumps, BlockDAG takes another route. It’s not betting on price swings. It’s banking on solid building blocks: developer tools, exchange support, and decentralized systems with long-term value. Exchange-Ready Liquidity with Institutional Reach Post-launch liquidity issues are common, but BlockDAG has planned ahead. With listings secured across 20+ exchanges, including MEXC, BitMart, XT.com, and LBank, the focus is on providing stable order books and institutional-level liquidity. A major part of the $600M goal is set aside for liquidity providers. This ensures smooth trading with minimal price slippage for all users. It’s a key difference that makes listings actually usable. The presence of OTC desks also ensures that large trades don’t shake the market. This kind of structure shows BlockDAG’s commitment to being CEX-ready from the start. Backing Developers Before the Mainnet Even Launches While most chains wait until after launch to support their ecosystem, BlockDAG is already acting. The testnet is active. A no-code dApp builder is already available. The developer academy is onboarding users now. These tools help prepare smart contract creators even before the mainnet goes live. BlockDAG is not delaying its infrastructure support. The funds are being used now to boost development, from grants and SDK tools to smart contract indexing and dApp templates. These early moves build usage, not just noise. By 2026, BlockDAG aims to support over 1,000 dApps. These will span DeFi, gaming, identity verification, and real-world asset applications. The presale is what fuels this timeline and vision. Broad Vision: User Participation and Tech-Driven Sectors BlockDAG’s hybrid system using DAG and PoW is just the start. Its mobile mining app has drawn in over 2 million users. It already has 200,000+ holders who are not just waiting but actively building. The goal is to push forward real usage and cross-sector growth. Along with grants and dApp onboarding, the project is exploring real use cases in DePIN and AI. These are not vague promises. Plans include tokenizing decentralized storage, microtransactions, and edge computing. Each of these needs proper infrastructure, liquidity, and coordination. So, when BlockDAG sets a $600M goal, it’s not for hype. It’s for building a powerful Layer 1 with lasting impact. One that delivers throughput and builds value that lasts beyond market cycles. BlockDAG’s Final Presale Hours: Last Chance for $0.0018 Entry Current Batch 29 is priced at $0.0276 with returns at 2,660% since Batch 1. For a few more hours, the $0.0018 offer remains open. The public launch price is confirmed at $0.05. But this sale isn’t only about entry prices. It’s funding validator networks, DeFi tools, and real infrastructure. This presale could place BlockDAG among the top-funded chains on launch day. And with 22.9 billion coins already sold and 18,124 miners distributed, momentum is clearly building. If the full $600 million target is met, BlockDAG will step into the market not with empty promises but with tools, liquidity, and readiness baked in.

Today, a surge in activity from tokens like Kaspa (KAS), HYPE, and Qubetics ($TICS) is seen. Kaspa, for instance, has experienced minor price fluctuations recently, while HYPE has made headlines with its $600 million treasury launch. With these developments, one might be wondering which cryptos are positioned for substantial growth. Could Qubetics ($TICS) be the next major breakthrough? The cryptocurrency market continues to grow rapidly, and in this dynamic environment, Qubetics ($TICS) has emerged with a revolutionary approach, offering the world’s first Web3 aggregator to unite multiple blockchains. This unique application addresses the challenges that previous blockchain solutions could not overcome. With its presale entering its final stage, Qubetics is quickly becoming a focal point for early buyers eager to take part in its success. At the same time, other projects like Kaspa (KAS) and HYPE are also seeing significant developments in the market. After exploring these projects further, it becomes clear that Qubetics is among the top cryptos for massive growth, with its innovative approach and strategic presale making it a compelling choice. Qubetics Application: Leading the Charge in Web3 and Blockchain Integration Qubetics ($TICS) brings an innovative decentralized VPN application to the Web3 space. Privacy and security are increasingly important in today’s digital world, and Qubetics is addressing these concerns by providing a decentralized, secure method of accessing the internet. For individual users, this means greater control over their data, offering an enhanced level of privacy compared to traditional VPNs. Businesses can also benefit from Qubetics’ robust technology, ensuring their communications remain secure while utilizing the full potential of Web3. Real-world applications highlight the importance of Qubetics’ platform. A small business, for example, can use Qubetics to securely connect with clients across borders without the fear of data breaches. For larger enterprises, Qubetics offers a solution for maintaining privacy in digital communications across multiple blockchains. Whether for personal use or corporate purposes, Qubetics promises to be an essential tool for anyone looking to stay ahead in the Web3 space. This forward-thinking application solidifies Qubetics as a standout project among the top cryptos for massive growth , as it brings both security and scalability to the forefront of the blockchain conversation. Qubetics Presale: A Rare Opportunity for Early Adopters As Qubetics moves into its final presale phase, now is the time to get involved before the price increases. The current presale price of $0.3370 offers an opportunity for early buyers to purchase $TICS tokens at a discounted rate before the listing price rises by 20%. With over $18 million raised and more than 516 million $TICS tokens already sold, Qubetics is proving to be a popular choice. The project has also reduced its total supply from over 4 billion to just 1.36 billion tokens, creating scarcity that could drive future value. For those considering participation in the Qubetics presale, the potential returns are significant. Take, for example, an investment of $25,000 at the current presale price of $0.3370. This would secure approximately 74,200 $TICS tokens. Once the token is listed at $0.40, this investment could be worth around $29,680, offering a healthy return. If the price of $TICS reaches $5 to $10 in the next market cycle, as predicted by early analysts, the same $25,000 investment could turn into $375,000 to $742,000. This makes Qubetics presale one of the most attractive opportunities in today’s crypto market, with high potential for growth in the future. Kaspa (KAS): Consistent Growth and Strong Market Presence Kaspa (KAS) has established itself as a reliable cryptocurrency, maintaining a strong market presence. Currently, KAS is priced at $0.07049, showing a slight decrease of 0.72% over the past 24 hours. Despite this minor drop, Kaspa continues to demonstrate stability, with a market cap of $1.85 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $34.9 million. The coin’s circulating supply is 26.33 billion KAS, with a maximum supply of 28.7 billion, ensuring that it has a solid foundation for continued growth. The dip in Kaspa’s price can be attributed to broader market conditions, with many cryptocurrencies experiencing fluctuations. However, the coin’s steady market cap, robust trading volume, and dedicated community offer reassurance that Kaspa remains a reliable asset for those looking for consistency in the crypto space. With the potential for future price rebounds and continued development, Kaspa is well-positioned as one of the top cryptos for massive growth in the coming months. HYPE: A Strong Entry into the Crypto Market HYPE has recently made significant waves in the crypto market with its announcement of a $600 million crypto treasury launched by the Lion Group. This major move enhances HYPE’s liquidity and strengthens its position within the market, signaling potential for substantial growth. While HYPE is still in its early stages, this significant funding initiative positions it as a promising asset in the ever-growing crypto sector. The $600 million treasury has the potential to drive HYPE’s long-term growth, with the additional resources providing the project with the necessary capital to scale and expand. As the cryptocurrency market integrates more with traditional financial systems, projects like HYPE, backed by large institutional support, are well-positioned to capitalize on this shift. HYPE’s financial backing and its future growth prospects make it one of the top cryptos for massive growth, positioning it as a standout player to keep an eye on in the near future. Conclusion: Qubetics, Kaspa, and HYPE: A Bright Future for Crypto Enthusiasts Qubetics, Kaspa, and HYPE all present compelling reasons to be optimistic about their future. Whether it’s Qubetics’ groundbreaking decentralized VPN application, Kaspa’s reliable market performance, or HYPE’s massive $600 million treasury, each project offers unique advantages that could drive significant growth. For those seeking the top cryptos for massive growth, Qubetics stands out, especially with its final presale phase. The project’s limited token supply and strong presale momentum present an excellent opportunity for early buyers to get involved before the price increases. Now is the perfect time to join this crypto presale and secure a position in one of the most exciting Web3 projects to date. With its focus on innovation and community-driven governance, Qubetics offers a rare opportunity that should not be missed. Don’t wait, take action now and be part of Web3’s next major breakthrough.

With the altcoin market heating up and investors seeking the next big winner, tokens like Polkadot (DOT), Kaspa (KAS), and Aptos (APT) remain in focus—but it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE that’s capturing the most attention for its early-stage momentum and breakout potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Frontrunner in 2025’s Crypto Presale Landscape MAGACOIN FINANCE has swiftly established itself as a frontrunner in the 2025 crypto presale landscape, raising over $10 million in a matter of weeks. The project’s official website offers limited access, with a bonus of 100% on investments using PATRIOTS100X. Its innovative staking platform and capped supply are appealing to both retail and institutional investors. Its contracts have been verified by HashEx, one of the most trusted names in smart contract auditing. The unique blend of meme appeal and utility is expected to drive continued growth. Solana (SOL): Bullish Structure and Institutional Support Solana is trading between $150 and $195, with analysts eyeing a breakout above $165 as a trigger for further gains. Institutional interest and ecosystem expansion continue to fuel optimism, and as SOL consolidates, many traders are allocating profits into MAGACOIN FINANCE for higher-upside exposure. Polkadot (DOT): Consistent Growth, Steady Outlook Polkadot is forecasted to trade between $3.67 and $3.68 in June, with longer-term projections pointing to steady but moderate gains. As DOT’s growth moderates, investors seeking sharper returns are increasingly looking to MAGACOIN FINANCE. Kaspa (KAS): Range-Bound but on Watchlists Kaspa is trading near $0.08, with technicals suggesting a range-bound summer. While KAS offers stability, it lacks the explosive upside now drawing capital to MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale. Aptos (APT): Bullish Forecasts and Ecosystem Growth Aptos is projected to trade between $4.44 and $4.48 in June, with bullish sentiment for 2025 as the ecosystem expands. As APT builds, some holders are diversifying into MAGACOIN FINANCE to capture early-stage gains. Final Thoughts With XRP, Solana, and Bitcoin followers all zoning in, MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting the pace for June 2025’s altcoin market. As DOT, KAS, and APT hold steady, the boldest opportunities may belong to those who move early on MAGACOIN FINANCE.

With global interest picking up again and regulatory pressures easing—especially in the U.S.—many investors are now looking beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum to find the next big winners. A fresh wave of energy is flowing into projects with strong long-term visions, real-world use cases, and growing communities. Whether you’re new to crypto or a pro investor, the right picks now could pay off big by the end of the year. Here are five notable cryptos that should be on your radar for 2025—and leading the pack is a bold newcomer making serious noise: MAGACOIN FINANCE . MAGACOIN FINANCE – Attracting Millions in Investment If you’re searching for the next breakout crypto, MAGACOIN FINANCE is a name you need to know. This project has quickly gained attention for its well-thought-out foundation and explosive presale rally. MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the talk of the crypto world. As more investors jump in early, it’s gaining serious momentum and turning heads across the community. Many experts believe it could be the next big meme-powered breakout. The project is currently in presale and it’s already becoming a favourite of smart investors. Seeing the long-term opportunity MAGACOIN FINANCE offers, analysts increased their forecast to 18,500% ROI in the mid-term. MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly proving it’s more than just hype. With each presale stage selling out fast, it’s showing real momentum—and if it keeps growing like this, it could end up being one of the biggest breakout stories of 2025. Cardano (ADA) – Foundation of the Future Cardano continues to show why it’s considered one of the most reliable long-term projects. What’s especially impressive is the ongoing ecosystem development . Cardano recently added XRP support in its Lace Wallet and is exploring partnerships around stablecoins and DeFi. It now has over 1.3 million staking addresses , which proves strong community trust. Founder Charles Hoskinson also proposed converting $100 million from the ADA treasury into Bitcoin and stablecoins to boost liquidity , showing an aggressive approach to long-term growth. On-chain data reveals a surge in long-term investors taking positions in crypto, making it a top choice to accumulate before 2025’s bull run begins. Polkadot (DOT) – Ready for a Comeback Despite the mixed volatility in price, Polkadot continues to push forward with its interoperability features and recently reached a key milestone in the rollout of Polkadot 2.0. The platform also has an active governance system, with the community currently voting on a crypto payment card and other initiatives. With Nasdaq requesting to list a 21Shares Polkadot ETF , there’s also growing institutional interest. If confidence keeps building, DOT could regain ground and climb toward new highs. Ondo Finance (ONDO) – Driving Real-World Adoption Ondo Finance is making major moves in tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) —a space that’s seeing explosive growth. In 2025 alone, this sector has grown over 260% , and Ondo is at the center of it. The project recently launched the Global Markets Alliance , a powerful partnership with big players like Solana Foundation, Trust Wallet, and BitGo , aimed at creating shared standards for RWAs. They’re also preparing to launch Ondo Global Markets , giving users outside the U.S. direct access to U.S. securities on-chain. Its tokenized U.S. Treasury product (OUSG) is expanding across blockchains, and TVL has doubled to nearly $1.4 billion . If you believe in the future of real-world asset integration into crypto, Ondo is a name to watch. Uniswap (UNI) – A DeFi Leader with Room to Run Uniswap is still the king of decentralized exchanges, and 2025 has brought solid attention to the UNI token. If market momentum returns in full swing, UNI could easily outperform many other large-cap DeFi tokens. Final Thoughts 2025 is shaping up to be a crucial year in crypto as regulations shape the market. Amid this, the above-mentioned five projects stand out for their vision, development, and potential to generate strong returns. While each has its strong potential to record big gains, MAGACOIN FINANCE is particularly exciting due to its early-stage entry point, which is absent in other coins. Getting in early on the right project can make all the difference—and MAGACOIN FINANCE looks like a strong bet for those aiming for long-term growth in 2025.

Crypto insiders — from private Discord groups to seasoned analysts — are calling MAGACOIN FINANCE one of the best-kept secrets in the current market. And they’re not just talking. They’re positioning early, stacking quietly, and preparing for what they see as one of the sharpest asymmetrical setups in 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Quietly Gaining Strength Across the Board While top-layer projects command headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is growing where it counts — on-chain. Insiders are quietly accumulating because the setup checks every box: a fully capped supply at 170 billion, live staking for passive income, and no centralized control or VC manipulation. It’s built for early movers who know how the market cycles work. Why insiders are circling now: 170B fixed token supply — scarcity that can’t be altered Staking already operational — rewards are active HashEx audited — security from day one No insider control — true decentralization On-chain signs of strategic accumulation Promo PATRIOTS100X gives entry bonus before wider exposure It’s not the loudest coin in the market — but that’s exactly why savvy investors are buying now. Quiet projects with solid mechanics and early behavioral signals often become the next big names when the cycle turns. Solana (SOL) Stays Strong but Traders Want More Solana (SOL) continues to be one of the most active Layer 1s, consistently leading in transaction volume and developer participation. However, without a recent price breakout, SOL’s market attention has cooled. Traders are watching for ecosystem updates or surprise listings to reignite momentum, but some have begun exploring altcoins offering more immediate value incentives. Polkadot (DOT) Progresses Technically, Lags in Price Polkadot (DOT) is delivering on its long-term vision with ongoing parachain launches and ecosystem development. Still, despite the technical progress, DOT’s price hasn’t reflected the project’s evolution. As a result, some traders are reallocating to newer projects with tighter supply mechanics and real-time staking features. Kaspa (KAS) Remains a Niche Holding Kaspa (KAS) continues to operate quietly, appealing mostly to investors focused on infrastructure and speed. While KAS has held its own during market dips, it has yet to gain mainstream momentum or deliver the type of performance that would prompt larger capital inflows. For now, it remains a niche but stable pick. Aptos (APT) Expands Ecosystem, Still Awaits Breakout Aptos (APT) shows promise through a growing network and increased developer adoption. However, price action hasn’t followed suit. Even with strong fundamentals and ranking high in daily active users, APT has not yet catalyzed the kind of move that momentum traders seek — driving attention to more active and flexible tokens. Final Thoughts While Solana, Polkadot, Kaspa, and Aptos continue to move within familiar narratives, MAGACOIN FINANCE is crafting a different one — quietly, steadily, and convincingly. Insiders aren’t speculating. They’re preparing. And with the token’s fundamentals and staking dynamics now fully in place, this so-called secret may not stay hidden for much longer.

While Bitcoin (BTC) continues to anchor the market, projects like Polygon (MATIC), Chainlink (LINK), Polkadot (DOT), and Uniswap (UNI) are capturing growing investor interest. Now entering the spotlight, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining significant traction—so much so that some analysts believe it could rival Ethereum’s momentum if current trends hold. MAGACOIN FINANCE Secures Premier Launch Status for 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of the standout crypto launches of 2025, capturing strong attention from both investors and analysts. With limited pre-sale access and a 100% bonus available through PATRIOTS100X, momentum is accelerating fast. Its viral branding and politically charged identity are resonating widely across the altcoin community. Backed by a full HashEx audit, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining credibility as one of the year’s most anticipated early-stage opportunities. Ethereum (ETH): Bullish But Facing New Competition Ethereum is trading between $2,750 and $3,300 in June 2025, with analysts forecasting a possible breakout to $3,321.81 if bullish sentiment holds. While ETH remains a leader in DeFi and smart contracts, its growth is being challenged by new, faster-moving projects like MAGACOINFINANCE. As Ethereum’s upgrades play out, some investors are diversifying into MAGACOINFINANCE for earlier-stage, higher-multiple opportunities. Polygon (MATIC): Range-Bound and Under Pressure Polygon is forecasted to trade between $0.23 and $0.24 in June 2025, with technicals suggesting limited upside for the near term. As MATIC’s growth moderates, capital is rotating toward high-momentum presales like MAGACOINFINANCE. Chainlink (LINK): Awaiting a Bullish Reversal Chainlink is trading in the $15.80–$16.50 range, with analysts watching for a breakout above $17.45 to confirm a new uptrend. While LINK’s fundamentals remain strong, many holders are diversifying into MAGACOINFINANCE to capture early-stage gains. Polkadot (DOT): Steady Growth, But MAGACOINFINANCE Steals the Show Polkadot could hit $6.00 by December 2025, nearly doubling its current price. However, with MAGACOINFINANCE’s presale momentum and scarcity-driven model, more investors are seeking sharper returns in this new market leader. Uniswap (UNI): Breakout and Cooldown Uniswap surged above $8.40 in early June, but signs of a cooldown are emerging as bulls try to sustain momentum. As UNI consolidates, traders are increasingly allocating to MAGACOINFINANCE for its explosive upside potential. Final Thoughts With Ethereum, MATIC, LINK, DOT, and UNI all showing mixed outlooks, MAGACOINFINANCE is quickly emerging as the altcoin to watch for 2025. Its unique fundamentals and accelerating demand could see it eclipse even the biggest names in the next cycle.

Bitcoin Long Positions Slightly Ahead But Shorts Catching Up After reaching a new all-time high (ATH) of $111,814 last month, BTC has consolidated within the $100,000–$110,000 range for nearly a month, offering little clarity on its next directional move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds Strong Despite Israel-Iran Tensions – Weekly Resistance Begins To Crack According to a new CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor BorisVest, fresh data from Binance crypto exchange suggests that long positions currently hold a slight edge in this range. Historical data reveals a pattern – when short positions rise, short squeezes tend to follow. Similarly, a buildup in long positions has often led to long squeezes. A decisive breakout from either end of the current range will likely determine Bitcoin’s next major move. That said, Binance data indicates that while long positions are marginally ahead, the ratio of longs to shorts remains relatively balanced. The funding rate hovering near neutral levels supports this view, reflecting a closely contested standoff between bulls and bears. However, such balance usually signals uncertainty in the market. While long interest has stabilized, short positions continue to climb – likely driven by expectations of further downside amid escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. BorisVest noted: This shows that most market participants believe the rally may not continue. When Bitcoin’s price starts to fall, and funding rates turn negative, it means shorts are piling in quickly. All of this points to this range being a highly sensitive zone. He further noted that with most traders leaning toward short positions, the setup could be ripe for a surprise move in the opposite direction – possibly fuelled by quiet accumulation from larger market participants. Is BTC Preparing For A Big Move? Despite BTC trading within the $100,000 – $110,000 range for the better part of the previous month, several analysts posit that the flagship cryptocurrency is preparing for a major move in the coming weeks.

For instance, crypto trader Josh Olszewics remarked that if liquidity holds, then BTC may eye a move toward the $150,000 level. From a technical standpoint, the outlook is encouraging. Crypto analyst Mister Crypto recently pointed out that BTC is forming a bullish inverse head & shoulders pattern on the 3-day chart. However, latest on-chain data shows that Bitcoin Network Value to Transactions (NVT) Golden Cross recently moved into an overpriced zone, warranting caution. At press time, BTC trades at $105,940, up 1.1% in the past 24 hours.

The economic environment is experiencing a paradigm shift as the migration of RWAs (real-world assets) onto blockchain networks is exemplified by creating digital representations of real, tangible value, including the ability to be traded, fractioned and accessed worldwide. This transition is not a mere case of technological innovation. Still, it can be considered a recasting of our worldview of ownership, liquidity and financial inclusion in this digital era. The tokenization revolution gains momentum Real estate asset tokenization has progressed from a speculative idea to a multi-billion-dollar global capability. Among the over $250 billion of tokenized assets, Ethereum holds about 55% of the market share and settles itself as the leading infrastructural platform of this digital transformation. That will include US Treasuries, real estate, commodities and intellectual property. The gains in this movement are charging at a fast pace. Assets such as real estate, treasuries and others are now being converted to liquid on the blockchain, which has over 18 billion in market value, and the prospects of it growing huge in the future. In the industry, it is anticipated that even greater growth will be evident in the future, considering that the market of tokenized assets, such as stablecoins, is currently forecasted to increase to 18.9 trillion in the year 2033, as suggested by a study by Ripple and BCG. Busting the conventional boundaries The idea of tokenizing assets is so popular because it helps to address the essential inefficiencies of conventional financial markets. Traditional asset ownership usually involves large down payment requirements , complicated intermediaries and statement periods. Tokenization resolves these concerns since this technology generates digital tokens reflecting fractional ownership of physical, real-world assets. Think of real estate – one of the most illiquid asset classes. With tokenization, commercial real estate valued in millions of dollars may be separated into thousands of digital tokens, each reflecting a minute share of ownership. Shareholders can buy these tokens at a much smaller financial outlay, sell them off on the secondary market, earn an equivalent fractional rent of the underlying property and have exposure to genuine property appreciation. This partial ownership is in no way limited to real estate. Art collections, vintage wines, precious metals (such as gold) and even income streams around intellectual property can be tokenized, enabling access to these investments to a broader pool than ever before. Thus, the investment process previously open only to institutional investors and the super-rich can be democratized. The technology foundation Asset tokenization is based on smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts whose terms are encoded directly into code. Such digital contracts automate several processes that have been handled by intermediaries up until now, such as the distribution of dividends or compliance checks. Embedding coded rules in digital tokens and the ability to observe and be linked to RWAs may result in financial tools enabling automatic compliance, capital calls and distributions, making more efficient end-to-end fund products. The blockchain platform on which such tokens run offers several essential benefits. Transparency and immutability – The ownership transfers will be lodged in a way that creates an audit book of all transactions, making the transactions of assets sound and transparent. Accessibility – Digital properties have the potential to be accessible 24 hours a day, all week, with international borders being broken. Changeable compliance – Regulatory requirements, investment restrictions and distribution rules can be automatically enforced in smart contracts without a human check. Faster clearing and settlement – Blockchain enables faster settlements, saving the time required to transfer traditional assets, which usually takes days. Growth is institutionally adopted The tokenization sector gained considerable credibility with the arrival of large financial companies. BlackRock announced its tokenized fund in March 2024, and asset giants like Franklin Templeton have launched their tokenization plans. This institutional legitimization has fueled the adoption and made the space legitimate in the eyes of traditional investors. The use of tokenization in financial assets should continue expanding in 2025 as a concept and an implementation, as adoption among large banks and asset managers is already bearing fruit. These institutions’ participation contributes capital, regulatory know-how and operational infrastructure that needs to be adopted to get mainstream. The development of regulation and local dominance The global regulatory environment regarding tokenized assets is changing quickly, and various jurisdictions are approaching oversight and compliance differently. Increased regulatory sandboxes and similar programs will enable the permissible growth of tokenization use cases among financial institutions, with more nations in APAC remaining at the forefront. These sandbox regulatory places offer a controlled platform for financial companies to experiment with tokenization solutions. They closely collaborate with regulators to establish documented frameworks. This joint plan aids in balancing innovativeness, investor protection and financial stability. Nevertheless, there are still issues like regulation. The regulation of asset tokenization involves a serious debate between the necessity of data privacy and the transparency of blockchain technology. Moreover, in most jurisdictions, the legal maturity of smart contracts is unassured, putting tokenization ventures into question. Conquering challenges of implementation Although asset tokenization has excellent potential, it also has various practical challenges that should be overcome to be readily adopted. Technical integration – One of the most significant risks of employing public blockchains in tokenization is the technological risk of smart contract exploits or leakage of private keys. Organizations must invest in security protocols , sound infrastructure and risk management. Custodial infrastructure – Not all existing financial institutions have the technical experience to handle blockchain-based assets directly. Instead, they may need to partner with existing custody providers or invest heavily in growing their own. Market liquidity – T he efficiency and effectiveness with which markets can buy and sell assets. Although the liquidity of tokenized assets may theoretically increase, many do not trade in large enough volumes, and there is a large bid-ask spread, especially when a narrow asset is tokenized or is an illiquid asset. Regulatory applications – The dynamic nature of the regulation makes it hard to decide what rules apply to tokenized assets. Therefore, compliance with the regulatory framework is more difficult and possibly restricts several institutions from engaging in the business. Success stories and acquisitions Asset tokenization is gaining ground in various sectors in the following areas. Treasury securities – Government bonds and treasury bills can be considered the most successful tokenized assets, where institutional investors have access to instruments they know on the blockchain platform. Real estate investment – Commercial and residential real estate are also being tokenized worldwide, which allows smaller investors to enter real estate markets that have been closed to their pipelines until now. Commodity trading – Precious metals, agricultural products and energy resources will be tokenized to increase trading efficiency and market access. Private credit – The advantages of tokenization are reducing the liquidity problem of traditional lending instruments and increasing transparency in lending. Carbon credits – These assets are related to the environment and are being tokenized to enhance carbon market trading and guarantee greater transparency. The way to the future In 2025, tokenized assets will coexist with traditional instruments, and combining innovations with tradition will generate specific hybrid models to ensure that the world of financial markets is faster, more transparent and accessible to more people. This hybrid scheme can be gradually adopted with enough consideration for traditional investors and regulators. Coupling the sale of tokenized assets with existing financial infrastructure opens up a massive opportunity for market players. Banks can implement new products and services, asset managers reach a wider audience of investors and portfolio diversification becomes feasible using access to new assets previously unattainable to an individual investor. Yet, it will be successful, provided it can overcome some of the present issues regarding the integration of technologies, clarity of regulations and market development. Companies that can afford to implement adequate infrastructure, maintain a proper compliance framework, and concentrate on the user experience will be in the best place to utilize the transformation. Conclusion RWA tokenization is a monumental change in conceptualizing ownership and value transfer in the digital economy. This innovation uses blockchain technology to provide digital versions of physical and financial assets, enabling the democratization of investment opportunities, increased market efficiency and new opportunities for institutional and retail investors. Although there are still hurdles regarding regulation, technology and market maturation, the trend is unmistakable because the industry is becoming increasingly institutional and the regulation less experimental. The companies that learn and respond to this change will be in a good position to take advantage of the future of the tokenization of assets market, which will be worth 18.9 trillion in the next decade. Not all aspects of the digital asset revolution involve technology. They include redefining the very structures of finance to be inclusive, efficient and accessible worldwide. In the future, we expect that the seamless connection of RWAs into blockchain networks will require constant interaction between technologists, regulators and financial institutions to create a more interconnected and globalized financial process.

The company aims to hold 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025 as an initial milestone. Building on this, it plans to increase its holdings to 42,000 BTC by the end of 2026. By the close of 2027, Semler intends to reach a total of 105,000 BTC. Semler Reports 287% Bitcoin Yield to Date According to the official press release, the company said it will fund these purchases using a mix of equity and debt financing, as well as operational cash flows. Semler, which in May 2024 became the second US public company to adopt Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset, has since emerged as a significant corporate Bitcoin holder. As of June 3, 2025, the firm reported a 287% yield on its Bitcoin investment and a $177 million unrealized gain. In a move to strengthen its new approach, Semler has appointed Joe Burnett as Director of Bitcoin Strategy. Burnett, formerly Director of Market Research at Unchained, brings more than seven years of experience in Bitcoin advocacy and research. In a statement, Eric Semler, chairman of Semler Scientific, said, “We are excited to have Joe join our Bitcoin strategy team and help drive our three-year-plan to own 105,000 Bitcoins. Joe is an analytical thought leader on Bitcoin and Bitcoin treasury companies. His expertise will be instrumental as we pursue our Bitcoin treasury strategy and aim to deliver long-term value to our stockholders.” Corporate Bitcoin Holdings Grow An increasing number of public companies are deepening their involvement with the largest cryptocurrency. For instance, Genius Group, an AI-driven education company, recently increased its corporate Bitcoin reserves from 66 BTC to 100 BTC, after acquiring an additional 34 BTC valued at approximately $3.42 million. The company resumed its Bitcoin purchases on May 22, following a May 6 US Court of Appeals ruling that lifted previous legal restrictions stemming from a dispute related to its merger with FatBrain AI. CEO Roger Hamilton described reaching 100 BTC as a milestone in their broader plan to accumulate 1,000 BTC. Earlier this month, New York-based Mercurity Fintech Holding announced it would raise $800 million to build a Bitcoin treasury reserve. The company plans to integrate staking and tokenized finance tools, using secure blockchain custody infrastructure to reshape its treasury operations and boost capital efficiency through yield generation.

While major names like Ethereum, XRP, Injective, and Bitcoin Cash wrestle with mixed technical setups, it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE and Solana that are commanding real-time trader interest. Fast, scalable, and structure-backed, these two are capturing capital that’s rotating out of slower-moving giants. Ethereum (ETH) Caught in Tight Trading Band Ethereum is hovering between $2,500 and $2,600 after a drop from recent highs near $2,900. Technicals are mixed — $2,600 acts as resistance, while $2,440 is critical support. Despite this, institutional moves are growing: Nasdaq-listed SharpLink Gaming acquired 176,270 ETH and staked 95% of it, underlining confidence even as short-term risks persist. ETH futures open interest hit $20 billion, and ETF optimism remains. But unless Ethereum reclaims $2,600–$2,800 soon, many traders may continue seeking quicker setups elsewhere. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Fast-Rising Altcoin Grabbing Serious Attention MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming one of the standout performers of the altcoin season — and insiders aren’t ignoring it. Backed by a locked supply of 170 billion tokens, live staking, and a fully audited smart contract (HashEx), the project has matured beyond meme status into a viable asset for both passive and high-leverage plays. What makes it even more compelling: Fixed Tokenomics: 170B cap eliminates dilution risk Live Staking Rewards: Active passive income for holders Audited Codebase: Technical trust from launch Decentralized Ownership: No VC lockups or insider manipulation Accumulation Patterns: On-chain metrics show increasing holder concentration PATRIOTS100X Bonus: Current promo fuels additional inflow from early buyers With traders rotating out of slower giants and looking for speed, structure, and upside, MAGACOIN FINANCE has moved from under-the-radar to breakout potential. XRP Eyes Breakout Amid Legal Countdown XRP is trading in the $2.20–$2.32 zone with notable upside potential — if legal clarity arrives. A potential settlement with the SEC is expected by June 16, 2025, which could also boost odds for a spot ETF approval (now at 85–87%). Injective (INJ) Holds Above Support, ETF Buzz Grows Injective is consolidating in the $12.00–$13.50 range. A confirmed hold above $13.00 could open the door to $14.00–$16.00 in June. TVL on the protocol jumped 22%, and Canary Capital’s new Injective trust hints at ETF potential. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Remains in Bullish Formation Bitcoin Cash is testing resistance at $454.74 after outperforming most large-cap altcoins recently. Strong retail and institutional demand have driven price action, and forecasts for June see potential highs of $468 or even $612 if momentum continues. Solana (SOL) Maintains Top Position in On-Chain Activity Solana has become a pillar of this market cycle’s activity layer. It continues to dominate in user count, transaction volume, and app development. Even without a breakout above key resistance, its real-world usage is giving traders strong reason to stay engaged. Final Thoughts In a market full of mixed signals, Solana and MAGACOIN FINANCE are standing out for all the right reasons. While Ethereum, XRP, Injective, and Bitcoin Cash continue to hold important positions, the fastest capital is now chasing where the next big move might emerge — and MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioned right at the heart of that shift.

Ethereum Price Falls & SUI Gains Volume, Yet All Eyes on BlockDAG’s 20 Exchange Rollout Plan",https://thecoinrise.com/which-crypto-will-explode-ethereum-price-falls-sui-gains-volume-yet-all-eyes-on-blockdags-20-exchange-rollout-plan/,"Is the SUI price ecosystem gaining real strength or showing signs of peaking? And is the Ethereum price fall just a temporary pullback or a warning of deeper losses? While both assets draw mixed reactions, BlockDAG (BDAG) is locking in long-term progress. With more than $313.5 million already raised toward its $600 million goal, BlockDAG is focused on execution, not speculation. With its mining rigs ready to ship, 20 exchange listings confirmed, a live mobile mining application, and a major U.S. sponsorship in pipeline, BlockDAG is delivering tangible results ahead of its listing. The current presale window still offers access at just $0.0018 until June 20, but time is running out. Which crypto will explode? It may well be the one already building, not just planning. BlockDAG is launching with results, not promises. BlockDAG’s $313.5M Raise Converts Plans Into Progress BlockDAG is taking action before its exchange debut. X30 and X100 miners are set to ship in July, with X10 rigs coming in August, solidifying the foundation of its network. With 2 million X1 app users and a live beta testnet using functional coins, the ecosystem is already active. Currently in Batch 29 of 45, BDAG is priced at $0.0276, while the $0.0018 limited-time offer continues to attract strong demand. Over $313.5 million has been raised, and more than 22.9 billion coins have been sold. An upcoming U.S. sponsorship deal is also boosting visibility, signaling serious pre-listing momentum. BlockDAG’s six-week roadmap includes airdrops, node setups, DeFi rollouts, and ecosystem tools before exchange trading begins. This positions it as a frontrunner in the question: Which crypto will explode? It is not just aiming for success, it is delivering it. The $600 million goal supports more than supply. It ensures exchange liquidity, expands miner production, funds developer support, and enables real-world tech such as DePIN and decentralized AI. BlockDAG is moving forward with real-world progress. How the SUI Price Ecosystem Is Gaining Ground The SUI price ecosystem is trading between $2.81 and $3.03, currently holding above $2.95. With around $984 million in daily volume and over 155 million active accounts, Sui is demonstrating real usage. Key tokens in its network, like Cetus, DeepBook, and Walrus, have helped it rank among the top 15 chains in DEX volume, as per Messari and CoinGecko. Sui saw a 14.6% increase in daily DeFi activity and just signed partnerships with WAYE.ai and Real Vision. These developments are expanding its reach and attracting institutional tracking. CoinMarketCap shows SUI with a $10 billion market cap, making it a top-tier Layer-1 chain for this cycle. With active protocols and new tools, Sui is laying the foundation for its next big price move. Ethereum Price Fall May Set Up a Bounce The recent Ethereum price fall has brought ETH down to about $2,520, hitting intraday lows around $2,493. This 7% decline followed geopolitical tension, especially regarding the Israel-Iran situation. Over $200 million in long positions were liquidated, and ETH fell below the $2,800 mark. Now, the $2,500 support is key. Holding that level could mean a bounce is near, while a break could pull it toward $2,260. Low open interest, negative funding rates, and weak ETH ETF inflows show that big money is cautious. The Fear & Greed Index is dipping, but not in full panic mode. Despite the Ethereum price fall, ETH remains vital for smart contracts, staking, and DeFi. This could be a cool-off phase before the next leg up, especially if ETFs regain traction and global markets stabilize. Concluding Thoughts Sui is holding strong with solid volume and new partnerships. Ethereum is testing support around $2,500, potentially resetting before another move. But it’s BlockDAG that’s making the biggest impression. With $313.5 million raised, 22.9 billion coins sold, and less than a day left for the $0.0018 offer, BlockDAG is moving forward with working tech, real plans, and public engagement. This isn’t a usual presale. BlockDAG already has mobile mining, live apps, and major sponsorships rolling out. Which crypto will explode? The one showing proof before promise. BlockDAG’s mid-presale progress, combined with its tech rollout and marketing, gives it a serious edge, and the presale door is still open.

While Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Optimism (OP), and VeChain (VET) remain on watchlists, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing attention for its record-breaking presale and unique fundamentals. Analysts now suggest it could be the next BTC-like performer of this cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE Positioned to Redefine the Altcoin Landscape in 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE is making waves in the digital asset space, firmly positioning itself as a standout project to watch in 2025. With a capped token supply and a bold, politically charged brand identity, it’s attracting growing interest from both retail and institutional investors. Analysts increasingly view MAGACOIN FINANCE as a potential disruptor in the evolving altcoin landscape. To incentivize early participation, the pre-sale offers a 100% token bonus for all contributors using the promo code PATRIOTS100X. Cardano (ADA): Stabilizing and Poised for Recovery Cardano is trading near $0.75 after a recent correction, showing signs of stabilization in the $0.65–$0.75 range. With strong fundamentals, ongoing upgrades like the Chang Hard Fork, and ecosystem growth, ADA could break $0.80 if positive sentiment continues. Ethereum (ETH): Bullish Momentum Builds Ethereum is expected to reclaim the $2,800–$2,900 zone in June 2025, with bullish momentum fueled by institutional buying and DeFi growth. ETH remains a leader, but investors are diversifying into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE for higher upside. Optimism (OP): Price Recovery Expected Optimism is forecasted to reach $0.67 in June 2025, with analysts predicting further gains in the second half of the year. As OP recovers, some traders are rotating into MAGACOIN FINANCE to capture early-stage momentum. VeChain (VET): Moderate Gains Forecast VeChain is trading at $0.02279 and could rise to $0.035 by the end of June, according to AI forecasts. While VET’s outlook is positive, the most aggressive capital is moving toward breakout plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Final Thoughts With ADA, ETH, OP, and VET all showing potential, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the altcoin with the strongest BTC-like upside for 2025.

46455859,https://invezz.com/?p=2771996,1750481100,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Late June top pick—this cypto leaves Bitcoin Cash (BCH) behind on all fronts,https://invezz.com/news/2025/06/21/late-june-top-pick-this-cypto-leaves-bitcoin-cash-bch-behind-on-all-fronts/,"Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has drawn attention again in late June—but not for the right reasons. While its origins as a hard fork of Bitcoin gave it early momentum, BCH has since struggled to remain relevant. Designed as a low-fee transactional coin, it has failed to grow into a full-scale ecosystem, especially in a crypto world now dominated by DeFi, staking, stablecoins, and Layer-2 infrastructure. With limited developer activity and shrinking use cases, BCH is increasingly seen as a legacy asset rather than a future-ready solution. That’s why prudent investors are now rotating into utility-first projects that actually serve the needs of modern decentralized finance. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly gaining ground as a standout among low-cap projects—designed not just to survive but to scale across real-world financial use cases. With a beta launch on the way, a full CertiK audit complete, and over $10.85M already raised, this new entrant is proving it belongs on every serious investor’s watchlist before Q3 begins. A platform, not just a token What makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) particularly exciting isn’t just the presale hype—it’s the foundation. With a clear roadmap and multiple future phases planned, the protocol is positioning itself as a Layer-2 enabled, regulatory-aligned DeFi platform that solves real liquidity problems in crypto. The launch roadmap is fully transparent. Following the initial development stages, Phase 3 will finalize key platform components like the DApp interface and smart contract integration. Beta testing will take place on testnet before the full live version rolls out. Later stages will include multichain expansion, institutional partnerships, and MUTM’s official exchange listing—all of which are built to scale. The platform will also introduce a fully overcollateralized stablecoin, designed to be minted and burned directly through smart contracts, backed by on-chain assets already in the system. Unlike fiat-backed alternatives, Mutuum’s stablecoin will be governed algorithmically and transparently—giving users a safer, decentralized borrowing option tied to real protocol activity. DeFi utility, not legacy hype Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity protocol designed for today’s evolving DeFi market. Unlike traditional projects, it will support both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models—creating room for a wide variety of users and assets, including less common ones like PEPE or SHIB. In the P2C model, users will deposit assets into smart contract-based pools and receive mtTokens—interest-bearing, tokenized receipts that represent their share in the pool. These mtTokens will provide users with real-time access to liquidity and composability across the DeFi space. For instance, depositing SOL will mint mtSOL in 1:1, which can later be traded, reused, or redeemed, offering much more flexibility than static deposit positions on older platforms. Meanwhile, P2P lending will allow users to directly create loan agreements with customizable terms. This dual lending system isn’t theory—it’s part of Mutuum’s concrete development roadmap. Platform development is already underway. The AI-powered helpdesk is implemented, smart contracts have passed their CertiK audit with a Skynet Score of 72.38, and both the front-end and back-end infrastructure builds are in motion. A legal and compliance team is under formation to ensure the protocol aligns with regulatory guidelines—another move that makes Mutuum stand out from earlier-generation crypto projects with no formal approach to compliance. All platform profits are planned to be used for MUTM token buybacks, which will then be redistributed to mtToken stakers. This model promotes both supply pressure and long-term holder value. For users looking to earn passively, mtToken users will be able to stake and receive a share of protocol revenue—making this ecosystem a real income generator once launched. Community traction reflects this momentum. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) now has 12,300+ holders, more than 10,000 active followers, and it continues to raise capital steadily in its Phase 5 presale at $0.03 per token. With the listing price set at $0.06, investors buying at the current stage are looking at a 2x return even before the token hits the exchange—and that’s without accounting for platform usage or future price discovery once the protocol goes live. Above all, this is not a project waiting to find product-market fit—it’s one that’s actively building toward launch. As the DeFi eco matures, projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will not just compete—they will redefine what it means to be a valuable crypto asset in 2025.

It’s Ethereum, and the ETF frenzy surrounding it is creating a ripple effect across the entire altcoin landscape. With Ethereum staking ETFs in the spotlight and inflows climbing, capital is rotating into other high-potential plays. Solana and XRP are leading the large-cap chase, while one unexpected presale—MAGACOIN FINANCE—is beginning to steal attention from even the most established names. Solana Eyes ETF Legitimacy Solana has spent years climbing out from Ethereum’s shadow, and in 2025, that effort is finally getting institutional validation. Despite short-term dips in decentralized exchange volumes, open interest in SOL futures has hit $7.4 billion—a clear sign that big money is circling. ETF speculation is pushing that interest further. U.S. approval chatter is growing louder, with analysts pointing to end-of-year timelines for potential spot products. If greenlit, Solana could become the first true Layer 1 ETF alternative to Ethereum. The fundamentals are there: fast transaction speeds, low fees, a thriving developer ecosystem, and a DeFi sector regaining momentum. Investors betting on Solana now are not just chasing hype—they’re positioning ahead of what could be a historic validation moment. XRP Returns to the Institutional Table XRP’s story was once defined by legal drama. But with Ripple’s landmark SEC settlement in March 2025, the fog has lifted—and institutions are taking notice again. Its inclusion in the Nasdaq Crypto Index wasn’t just a headline grabber—it was a greenlight for conservative capital to re-enter. Corporate treasuries are rebalancing into XRP, drawn to its role in cross-border payments and growing regulatory clarity. Bitwise and Grayscale have both filed for XRP spot ETFs. Analysts now place the odds of approval near 85%. If those filings are approved, XRP could shift from a rebound play to a top-tier ETF asset—especially with its global remittance utility already live and scaling. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Presale With Breakout DNA While blue chips battle it out for ETF dominance, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly building the kind of grassroots frenzy that usually precedes viral rallies. It’s not listed. It’s not widely known. But insiders are watching it closely—and early buyers are treating it like the next 80x ticket. What’s driving that momentum? A mix of sharp fundamentals and early-stage scarcity. MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t promising the moon with vaporware. It’s delivering structure: capped supply, audited smart contracts, and a release plan that favors early adopters rather than whales or VCs. It’s already topping analyst rankings for 2025 presales and pulling capital from traders who’ve made fortunes on early SHIBA and DOGE entries. But unlike many meme coins, MAGA is doing something rare—it’s building without overpromising. The timing is also key. As Ethereum and Bitcoin dominate headlines with ETF news, investors are hunting for under-the-radar tokens that could surge once the rotation hits small caps. MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as that trade—low entry, high narrative upside, and real traction beneath the memes. Final Word: Don’t Miss the Rotation Ethereum’s ETF momentum is more than just a market narrative—it’s a signal that institutional crypto is entering a new phase. That phase is pulling attention toward Solana and XRP, both of which now sit at the intersection of adoption, regulation, and ETF speculation. But the smartest capital isn’t just watching the majors. It’s moving early, before the headlines, into tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE that can offer asymmetric upside when the next cycle ignites. Because by the time the ETF approvals land, and the mainstream catches up—it’s already too late to buy early.

And can the Solana price bounce back after a sharp 13% slide and heavy exchange inflows? While these two battle for direction, BlockDAG is already making its move. Instead of holding back, BlockDAG is rolling forward. Shipments for the X30 and X100 miners begin on July 7, with the X10 following on August 15. On top of that, a major U.S. sponsorship reveal drops June 20. Over $313.5 million has already been raised during presale, and we’re still in Batch 29. With only 16 batches remaining, now is the rare moment when product delivery, brand momentum, and discounted pricing collide. Still asking which crypto will explode next? This could be your clearest signal. BlockDAG Kicks Off Shipments Before Listings Even Start While most projects hype up plans, BlockDAG is checking boxes in real time. Miner shipments are set for July 7 for X30 and X100 units, with X10 devices following on August 15. The June 20 U.S. sponsorship announcement will give BlockDAG a major branding push before the coin even hits exchanges. Hardware, marketing, and delivery are all lining up now, something few projects manage even years post-launch. All of this is happening during the presale phase. Batch 29 is active out of a total of 45, with BDAG priced at $0.0276. But until June 20, buyers can still grab it at just $0.0018. Over 22.9 billion BDAG have been sold already, with total raised funds exceeding $313.5 million. This isn’t just a target, it’s real capital already powering a growing ecosystem. That $600 million goal supports liquidity across 20 upcoming exchange listings, including five Tier-1 platforms. It funds the miner rollout, enhances the mobile app (which now boasts over 2 million users), and fuels developer tools and DeFi integrations. BlockDAG is not just planning, it’s building live. Still debating which crypto will explode next? The clock is ticking, and the offer is closing. Ethereum Price Forecast Stays Trapped but Shows Signs of Pressure Building The Ethereum price forecast shows ETH sitting in a tight range, with possible upside to $2,540–$2,550 if support at $2,500 holds. If it slips under that mark, some predict a dip toward $2,260. On the flip side, if Ethereum clears $2,950 resistance, it could climb to $4,200 by year-end. Current technical indicators like the Ichimoku Cloud and the 50-day SMA are mixed, leaving both bullish and bearish scenarios open. On the fundamentals side, Ethereum is seeing strong support. Futures open interest has surged nearly 40%, and ETH-focused ETFs continue pulling in capital. These numbers back a longer-term Ethereum price forecast in the $3,100–$3,600 range if volume remains high. With over half of all global stablecoins running on Ethereum and the Pectra upgrade enhancing performance, ETH’s foundation looks solid. Still, unless it breaks past $2,950 soon, the price may continue hovering in its current narrow band. Solana Price Fall Puts Pressure on Key Support Levels The Solana price fall made waves after SOL dropped 13% recently, touching $142.13 before showing signs of a minor recovery. Analysts link the dip to global tensions and a wider crypto pullback. One red flag was a large exchange inflow of 2.8 million SOL, which triggered more selling. Technical indicators like the EMA and Ichimoku Cloud continue flashing bearish signals. For now, support between $143 and $144 is the key battleground. To reverse the trend, SOL needs to reclaim the $150–$155 range. Without that move, sentiment stays shaky. Traders are watching volume and activity across major exchanges closely. If outflows increase or liquidity shrinks, another leg down could follow. While the worst of the Solana price fall may have passed, SOL is still skating on thin ice. What happens next around the $144–$150 zone will likely define the rest of June’s trend. Key Insights The Ethereum price forecast keeps ETH boxed between $2,500 and $2,950, waiting for the next catalyst. At the same time, the Solana price fall is testing support, with hopes resting on a return above $150. Both are in holding patterns, with traders staying cautious. Meanwhile, BlockDAG is racing forward. Miner deliveries begin July 7, the U.S. sponsorship reveal is set for June 20, and over $313.5 million has already poured into the presale. Batch 29 is underway, the $0.0018 deal is closing on June 20, and only 16 batches remain. If you’re seriously asking which crypto will explode next , BlockDAG’s timing, momentum, and delivery make it a top contender. While others wait, BlockDAG acts, and that could be the edge that sets it apart in 2025.

Traders Debate Which Will Lead the Next Boom,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/xrp-or-magacoin-finance-traders-debate-which-will-lead-the-next-boom/,"Intro: The Market Looks for a New Leader Crypto markets are shifting quickly, and traders are asking a pointed question: which altcoin has the clearest path to leading the next breakout? While XRP enjoys institutional optimism and legal momentum, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the stealth favorite for early-stage upside. Meanwhile, assets like Ethereum, Optimism, Aptos, and Chainlink are holding their ground — but not commanding headlines. XRP Nears Its Defining Moment XRP is trading between $2.20 and $2.32 as the long-awaited resolution of its lawsuit with the SEC draws closer — possibly by June 16. A favorable outcome could drive a breakout toward $3.00–$4.00, especially with ETF speculation now at all-time highs. On-chain payment volume surged over 1,300% in a single day, showing serious investor interest. However, the risk remains: any delay or unfavorable ruling could stall XRP’s upside in the short term. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Quiet Growth, Strong Positioning MAGACOIN FINANCE is starting to attract high-conviction capital. As traders debate XRP’s legal path, many are quietly loading MAGACOIN FINANCE — citing its scarcity, staking rewards, and decentralized structure. Unlike other early projects, this one isn’t just promising features — it’s already delivering. What’s fueling the shift: Fixed 170B Token Supply: No dilution, clear long-term upside Staking Is Live: Passive income rewards active now HashEx Audit: Verified code for institutional-grade confidence No Insider Control: 100% community-owned PATRIOTS100X Bonus: Strategic incentive for early buyers On-Chain Behavior: Growing wallet concentration and reduced churn This project isn’t riding a headline — it’s building through behavior, and analysts are beginning to take serious note of the pattern. Ethereum (ETH) Waits for Confirmation Ethereum is stuck in a volatile range near $2,500–$2,600. Though institutional interest is strong — including a massive acquisition by SharpLink Gaming and high open interest in ETH futures — traders are waiting for ETH to reclaim $2,600 resistance to confirm a bullish trend. The long-term outlook remains strong thanks to the Pectra upgrade and ongoing ETF tailwinds, but near-term momentum has softened. Optimism (OP), Aptos (APT), and Chainlink (LINK) Show Mixed Signals Optimism continues to expand its Layer 2 ecosystem, but price performance has been flat, with no major catalysts recently. Aptos ranks high in active users and developer traction but lacks a strong short-term narrative to drive price momentum. Chainlink remains critical infrastructure with growing real-world integrations, yet LINK’s price has not kept pace, causing traders to reallocate toward faster-moving plays. Final Thoughts XRP may be approaching a legal breakthrough, but MAGACOIN FINANCE is building a momentum cycle of its own — one based on fundamentals, not court decisions. While Ethereum, Optimism, Aptos, and Chainlink hold their zones, the real competition for breakout leadership is now between two very different contenders — and traders are choosing sides.

Solana is currently holding near $175, with its price action reflecting cautious optimism but no clear momentum. Traders are watching closely, but the direction remains uncertain. Cardano is showing signs of stability around the $0.75 mark. After a steady pullback, technical signals suggest a possible shift, but confirmation is still needed. The price is holding, yet broader conviction has not returned in full. But Unstaked ($UNSD) brings a different approach entirely. It moves past speculation and instead focuses on performance-based outcomes through its Proof of Intelligence model. In doing so, it builds a foundation rooted in real utility and measurable engagement. This makes it a strong candidate among the top crypto coins of 2025. Solana Holds Steady as Traders Watch for a Breakout Move Solana is hovering near $175, showing signs of stability while consolidating just above a key support level. Recent price action has formed a tightening range, reflecting a classic buildup phase. This has caught the attention of traders who are preparing for a potential move in either direction. Technical indicators show mixed signals. The RSI sits in neutral territory, and the MACD has flattened, signaling market indecision. A breakout above $188 could reignite bullish momentum, while a drop below $165 might expose Solana to further downside. For now, all eyes remain on which level gives way first. Cardano Stabilizes Around $0.75: Market Eyes Next Move Cardano is trading near $0.75 after pulling back from highs above $1.10 earlier in the month. The current range between $0.65 and $0.75 appears to be forming a short-term base. This consolidation is drawing attention as a possible launch point, especially if market sentiment improves. Bollinger Bands show price hugging the lower end, suggesting low volatility but potential for expansion. A push above $0.77 with strong volume could mark the start of a new uptrend. However, losing support near $0.69 may trigger a pullback. It is a wait-and-watch zone with breakout potential on both sides. Why Unstaked’s Proof of Intelligence Model Breaks the Mold in AI Crypto Unstaked is not chasing hype or relying on inflated airdrops to drive attention. Instead, it is building around a performance-based model that rewards real engagement. At the heart of this approach is its Proof of Intelligence framework, a system that logs every AI agent’s actions directly on-chain. This creates transparent records of participation, ensuring that only meaningful interactions and measurable community growth earn $UNSD rewards. This design shifts the focus away from random token giveaways and puts output at the center of the ecosystem. Participants are not rewarded for simply holding tokens or being early. They are rewarded for activating agents, driving interactions, and contributing value. With over $10.2 million raised and the current price at $0.011739 in Stage 21, buyers are entering a project that measures performance, not just presence. The model benefits those who engage. Agents powered by Unstaked will run across platforms like Telegram and X, designed to create content, interact with users, and learn from feedback. That makes each user not just a participant, but a force for real influence in the network. Unstaked is building more than just an AI token. It is creating a system where utility and merit define value. For anyone looking past short-term hype, it stands out as a top crypto coin 2025 buyers should be watching. Final Analysis Solana and Cardano continue to attract attention through price ranges and technical setups, but their future moves remain closely tied to overall market trends. While these assets reflect sentiment-driven momentum, they offer limited engagement beyond the charts. Unstaked is taking a different route by building around real contribution and measurable outcomes. Its Proof of Intelligence model rewards activity that can be tracked and verified on-chain.

As the market pivots and focus sharpens on utility-focused platforms, a few standout names are moving up the ranks. Web3 ai, POL, AAVE, and BNB are all gaining interest for their development pace, ongoing ecosystem enhancements, and future-forward designs. Whether it’s DeFi growth, artificial intelligence, or Ethereum scaling, each of these projects brings something powerful to the crypto space. As presale phases advance and market confidence returns, these coins are drawing attention from thoughtful traders and risk-takers alike. Here’s why they’re the top performing crypto options to look at right now. Web3 ai: AI Plus Blockchain, Backed by a $8.1M Presale Web3 ai is capturing the spotlight as one of the top performing crypto projects blending artificial intelligence with blockchain. With a presale entry at $0.000443 in Stage 9, the platform has raised more than $8.1 million so far. Over 22.8 billion coins have been sold, and its future listing price of $0.005242 sets up a projected 1747% return. The team is building a platform where Web3 meets intelligent automation, offering user-friendly AI tools that operate directly on blockchain systems. These features include autonomous agents and integrations aimed at real-time execution of smart contracts. Many AI tools will become available post-listing, unlocking fresh ways to interact with crypto ecosystems. What really gives Web3 ai its edge is timing. AI is booming, and blockchain adoption is expanding. Web3 ai bridges these two trends. It’s early, it’s active, and it’s designed to meet the future head-on. Among all top performing crypto coins to buy now, Web3 ai leads with its massive ROI potential and a strong use-case foundation. POL: Driving Polygon 2.0’s Next Phase POL is the centerpiece of Polygon 2.0’s evolving system, taking on both governance and utility roles. It helps secure an expanding ecosystem of Layer 2 chains and supports validator rewards across new modular structures. As Ethereum scaling stays relevant, POL emerges as one of the top performing crypto names in infrastructure. Polygon’s shift toward a more decentralized setup gives POL users a real voice in shaping future upgrades. This governance push attracts those interested in long-term utility rather than short-term hype. As rollup technology gains momentum, POL’s position strengthens in powering Ethereum’s broader scaling goals. AAVE: Lending Protocol Upgrades Keep It in Focus AAVE remains a top performing crypto within the DeFi world. It holds over $8 billion in TVL and is set to launch Aave V4, which will offer cross-chain liquidity features and modular architecture for more efficient asset flows. Another major update is GHO, a decentralized dollar-pegged stablecoin slowly gaining traction. AAVE is also moving toward real-world asset adoption and working with institutions, signaling strong forward momentum. Its consistently high developer activity on GitHub shows that AAVE is more than just another lending app, it’s a project with long-term focus. BNB: Central to Binance’s Expanding Network BNB continues to be a top performing crypto thanks to its wide range of use cases within the Binance ecosystem. It powers fee discounts, enables DeFi and NFT activity, and offers access to exclusive launchpad events. Recent developments include Binance’s burn of over 2 million BNB, helping limit the overall supply. Meanwhile, Binance is expanding into regulation-friendly regions like Dubai and Thailand, which could improve long-term stability for the coin. The addition of services like Binance Inscriptions also adds more layers to BNB’s ongoing growth story. Key Takeaways Each of these coins holds a unique spot in the crypto space. POL empowers governance, AAVE enhances lending, and BNB supports a growing platform. But Web3 ai brings a rare mix of timing, utility, and growth upside. With over $8.1 million raised, a current price of $0.000443, and a 1747% return forecast, Web3 ai has captured serious attention. It blends the best of AI and blockchain, making it a clear standout among top performing crypto assets. For those looking to catch the next big move, Web3 ai might be the one to watch closest.

At the time of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $105,383, reflecting a 0.8% increase over the past 24 hours. While this upward move has not sparked a major breakout, analysts are paying close attention to on-chain and market structure indicators that suggest a cautiously balanced environment. Related Reading: Analyst Warns Of Bitcoin Breakdown—’If This Continues, It Snaps’ On-Chain Data Points to Equilibrium, But Demand Wanes According to CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost, the market currently lacks extreme signals of profit-taking or panic. In a recent analysis, Darkfost explained that realized profits over a seven-day moving average remain below $1 billion. This is in line with figures observed during the market correction in late 2024 and significantly below peaks seen in early 2025. The analyst suggests that the current realized profit levels point to a market that is not under pressure from large-scale investor exits, supporting the ongoing consolidation. In the same report, Darkfost also discussed how a decline in demand may be limiting further upward momentum. By analyzing the ratio of new supply to the supply held inactive for over a year, the study observed that while demand remains positive, it has been weakening since Bitcoin’s local high in May. This suggests that although the market is absorbing existing selling pressure, fresh buying interest is not strong enough to trigger a new rally. As a result, the market appears to be in a state of temporary equilibrium, a phase where both sellers and buyers are relatively inactive. Bitcoin Traders Brace for Volatility in a Crowded Range Another CryptoQuant analyst, BorisVest, echoed the sentiment of a tightly contested market by analyzing Binance order flow and position data. He noted that Bitcoin has traded within a range of $100,000 to $110,000 for nearly a month. Within this band, both long and short positions have been building, and traders are watching the extremes of this zone closely. According to BorisVest, any breakout beyond $110,000 or drop below $100,000 could set the tone for the next significant price movement. The $100K–$110K price range has become a battleground for both bulls and bears. BorisVest observed that short positions are currently increasing, indicating that a significant portion of market participants expect a downward correction.

On-Chain Signals Say ‘Watch This Level’ However, he also pointed out that when shorts dominate, the risk of a sudden reversal, known as a short squeeze, becomes more likely. This behavior is consistent with recent funding rate trends, which show a fairly balanced distribution of long and short bets.

On June 21, the total cryptocurrency market dropped by 1.26% to $3.21 trillion, wiping out nearly $240 billion in value. Bitcoin led the fall, slipping to a low of $103,127, down 2% in just seven days. Altcoins were hit even harder—Ethereum dropped to $2,456, losing 10% during the same time. But what exactly is causing this crypto market crash? Let’s break down! Israel-Iran War & U.S. Involvement Fears The biggest trigger has been the rising conflict between Israel and Iran. Crypto investors are now worried that the U.S. might step into the war, as Trump has already warned Iran over not signing a deal. As a result, Bitcoin fell from $108,000 to $103,000 in a week, while Ethereum, Solana & Dogecoin also dropped over 10%. Whale Sell-Offs Taking Profits Whales are starting to sell huge amounts of Bitcoin and moving off altcoin on the exchange. According to Glassnode data , wallets that held BTC for 6–12 months sold over $900 million recently. Even those who’ve held Bitcoin for over a year have started cashing out. In early June, long-term holders took home $1.2 billion in profits, one of the biggest profit-taking waves this year. Massive Liquidations Add Pressure As prices dropped, many traders using leverage got wiped out. In the past 24 hours alone, over $503 million in crypto positions were liquidated, with 134,000 traders affected. Most of these losses happened on Ethereum, which saw $183 million in liquidations. The largest single loss was seen by a Bitcoin trade worth $8 million on the Bybit exchange. Altcoins Hit Harder Than Bitcoin While Bitcoin dropped about 2%, most altcoins dropped even more. Ethereum is down 10% for the week, Solana fell over 11%, and XRP lost 1.4%. The Altcoin Index has dropped to 22, showing Bitcoin is dominating the market. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In the past 24 hours, $503 million in crypto was liquidated. Bybit saw the most with $191.19 million, followed by Binance ($115.60 million) and Gate ($73.07 million). How much BTC, ETH, and XRP were liquidated in the past 24 hours? In the past 24 hours, over $503 million in crypto positions were liquidated overall. Specifically, Ethereum saw $183 million in liquidations, and XRP lost 1.4%. Bitcoin had a single $8 million liquidation. Is this crypto dip a buying opportunity or a signal to get out? This dip presents a complex situation. While historical patterns suggest Bitcoin often rebounds after geopolitical events, ongoing whale sell-offs and liquidations add risk, making careful research and risk assessment crucial for any investment decision. Will the market rebound quickly, or is this the start of a deeper correction? The market’s immediate future is uncertain. While some historical trends suggest a potential rebound after geopolitical shocks, the extent of whale selling and mass liquidations indicates that a deeper correction is possible if these pressures persist.",News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-21 05:01:45

This sharp uptick in activity comes at a time when most altcoins remain sluggish, making XRP one of the few standout performers. BREAKING: $XRP futures just exploded. $3.96 billion traded in 24 hours. That’s not hype—it’s a signal. Here’s what’s really going on — Ripple Van Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) June 20, 2025 What’s Fueling the Spike? The sudden excitement centers around XRP hitting a key resistance level at $2.14. As the price neared this technical threshold, traders in the derivatives market rushed in, pushing both the funding rate and open interest higher. A positive funding rate now indicates that more traders are betting on XRP’s price increasing, with long positions paying a premium to shorts. Open Interest Soars, Binance Takes the Lead 4/ Open Interest jumped 5% in 24 hours. That’s an extra $550M in bets placed on XRP futures. More money in the game = higher volatility = bigger moves coming. — Ripple Van Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) June 20, 2025 In just 24 hours, XRP open interest jumped 5%, adding $550 million in new futures positions. This signals that more capital is flowing into XRP trades, likely setting the stage for greater volatility and bigger price moves. Binance led the charge, handling 30.58% of XRP futures volume, worth $1.21 billion. Bybit and OKX followed, contributing $793 million and $520 million, respectively. While the technicals have triggered this rally, fundamental factors are also at play. Ripple’s ongoing global expansion and the growing buzz around potential regulatory clarity in the U.S. are helping boost market sentiment. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : ChatGPT XRP Price Prediction: Big Surge Coming? , XRP Price Prediction Looking at the price momentum, XRP is currently priced below $3, but crypto analyst Egrag Crypto believes a major breakout could be on the horizon. According to his analysis, XRP might surge to as high as $27 within the next two years, marking a historic rally for the altcoin. Egrag points to a repeating fractal pattern from 2017 that seems to be forming again on the charts. If XRP follows this same trajectory, the double-digit price target could become a reality before 2026. With more than six months left in 2025, the analyst has laid out a clear roadmap showing how XRP could mirror its past cycle to reach this bullish milestone. What It All Means Moreover, this isn’t just short-term hype. The explosion in XRP futures volume is a clear signal of renewed trader confidence. XRP is showing signs of momentum, and if the token breaks above the $2.14 resistance, it could unlock the next major leg up. Moreover, with strong technicals and rising investor confidence, XRP’s comeback is imminent. Traders are closely watching the $2.14 level. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In a latest update, Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas have further raised the odds of spot crypto ETFs being approved this year. The odds are now 90% or higher, according to them. The SEC is actively engaging with issuers, which they see as a very bullish signal. NEW: @EricBalchunas & I are raising our odds for the vast majority of the spot crypto ETF filings to 90% or higher. Engagement from the SEC is a very positive sign in our opinion pic.twitter.com/5dh8G8rK6Y — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) June 20, 2025 Solana, XRP, and Litecoin Now Have a 95% shot Solana, XRP, and Litecoin are leading with a 95% chance of ETF approval. Other altcoins, such as Cardano, Dogecoin, Polkadot, Avalanche, and HBAR, are holding strong at 90% odds. SUI lags with just 60% odds due to regulatory uncertainty and the lack of a futures market. These rising odds show growing confidence from ETF experts after the SEC recently acknowledged several 19b-4 filings and requested updates to S-1 forms. These are strong signs that things are moving forward. Polymarket bettors are also bullish as they give a 98% chance to an XRP ETF approval this year, 91% for Solana, and 71% for Dogecoin. XRP’s ETF filing, backed by Grayscale, Bitwise, and Franklin, was acknowledged by the SEC, with a final decision due by October 17. Analysts are confident in approval, as XRP is seen as a commodity with CFTC-regulated futures. Solana’s deadline is October 10, and with similar status, it’s also a strong candidate. Approvals Inevitable! Seyffart says that this is now a matter of “when, not if”. However, the timings of these launches remain uncertain. Approvals could come in the next month or two, or maybe not until October. The SEC’s recent moves signal a pro-crypto shift, and asset managers are jumping in. They aim to repeat the huge success of spot Bitcoin ETFs. But matching Bitcoin’s momentum will not be easy. Geraci Sees 2025 as Breakout Year for Crypto ETFs Nate Geraci, President of the ETF Store, says spot crypto ETF approvals are very likely in 2025, including staking for spot ETH ETFs and in-kind creations/redemptions. He also expects BlackRock to join the race for Solana and XRP ETFs. The US SEC has quietly taken a major step toward altcoin ETFs.

Yet as the broader market evolves, investor focus is shifting toward high-velocity opportunities. MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP are emerging as frontrunners for outsized returns, while Uniswap (UNI), Polkadot (DOT), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Litecoin (LTC) continue to attract attention from strategic traders. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Redefining Presale Standards in Crypto MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting a new benchmark in the cryptocurrency space, quickly establishing itself as a next-generation altcoin with long-term potential. Backed by a transparent allocation model, a capped token supply, and a bold narrative, the project continues to attract attention across the investor spectrum. Industry experts see MAGACOIN FINANCE as a strategically positioned asset with strong momentum heading into Q3, 2025. To reward early participants, the pre-sale includes a 100% token bonus for all contributors using the promo code PATRIOTS100X. XRP: Legal Clarity and Institutional-Grade ETF Momentum XRP is trading near $0.54, with the June 16 Ripple lawsuit decision and ETF speculation fueling volatility and high trading volumes. A favorable outcome could push XRP above $0.65, with analysts eyeing $3 or higher if bullish momentum persists. As regulatory clarity builds, XRP could see renewed institutional inflows, but many traders are also looking to MAGACOIN FINANCE for even faster gains. Ethereum (ETH): Slow and Steady Growth ETH is trading between $2,750 and $3,300, with forecasts for a year-end range of $3,400–$3,800 and a long-term target of $1 trillion in market cap. While ETH remains a blue-chip leader, its ROI potential from current levels is more modest compared to emerging stars like MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP. Uniswap (UNI): Breakout and Cooldown Uniswap surged above $8.40 in early June, marking a 30% rally, but signs of a cooldown are emerging as bulls try to sustain momentum. As UNI consolidates, traders are increasingly allocating to MAGACOIN FINANCE for its explosive upside potential. Polkadot (DOT): Range-Bound but Steady Polkadot is forecasted to trade between $3.67 and $3.68 in June, with longer-term projections pointing to steady but moderate gains. As DOT’s growth moderates, investors seeking sharper returns are increasingly looking to MAGACOIN FINANCE. Bitcoin Cash (BCH): Gradual Gains BCH is trading near $426, with forecasts for a gradual rise to $445–$468 by July. While BCH remains a solid performer, its upside is limited compared to high-momentum presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Litecoin (LTC): Positive Outlook Litecoin is expected to reach $111 by the end of June, with a potential 21% ROI for the month. As LTC continues its steady climb, the boldest capital is rotating into MAGACOIN FINANCE for higher-multiple upside. Final Thoughts While Ethereum’s $1 trillion target is impressive, MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP are capturing the spotlight for their faster growth potential. With UNI, DOT, BCH, and LTC also in play, 2025 is shaping up to be a dynamic year for altcoin leaders.

This shows that Texas is serious about using and protecting cryptocurrency as part of its official financial plans. Update: Texas has passed a law securing off-treasury $BTC reserves, with a key decision on SB21 potentially allowing the state to buy #Bitcoin , set for June 22. #CoinPedia #CryptoNews #Blockchain #CryptoMarket pic.twitter.com/jS0eJluyH9 — Coinpedia (@CoinpediaNews) June 21, 2025 Bitcoin Investment Bill Awaits Abbott’s Decision While HB 4488 is now law, all eyes are on Senate Bill 21 (SB21) , which proposes allowing Texas to invest directly in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with market caps over $500 billion. At present, only Bitcoin qualifies, making it the prime candidate for state investment. Governor Abbott has until June 22 to sign or veto SB21. If he takes no action, the bill will become law automatically. SB21 would mark a major milestone in crypto adoption at the state level, aligning Texas with a growing number of institutions that view Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. Institutional Momentum Builds Around Bitcoin Governor Abbott’s steps mirror a broader institutional trend. Hedge fund manager Eric Semler, who chairs healthcare firm Semler Scientific, has been vocal in his support of Bitcoin as a long-term investment . Semler’s firm recently increased its Bitcoin holdings, reinforcing the view that crypto is gaining ground as a store of value. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Crypto Market Is Down Today? $240B Wiped Out Amid Israel-Iran Tensions , His popular approach, investing in what most don’t, has paid off historically, especially in turbulent markets. Semler’s confidence in Bitcoin also echoes the sentiment of a growing number of hedge funds; recent data shows nearly half now have some crypto exposure. Texas is Sending a Message The passage of HB 4488 shows that Texas is serious about protecting its crypto reserves. If SB21 follows, the state could become one of the first to officially invest in Bitcoin. Together, these two bills reflect a calculated but forward-looking approach. For investors and institutions watching from the sidelines, Texas might be the place where crypto meets government policy and gets taken seriously. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

SB21 is highly likely to become law as Governor Abbott’s deadline is June 22, 2025, and inaction means automatic passage. It would enable Texas to directly invest in Bitcoin, creating a state-managed reserve. What are the potential risks of Texas holding Bitcoin as a strategic reserve outside traditional assets? Potential risks include Bitcoin’s high volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and cybersecurity threats. Critics also question whether government involvement in speculative assets aligns with prudent fiscal policy. Why is only Bitcoin currently qualifying for Texas’s proposed investment bill and could Ethereum join later? Only Bitcoin currently qualifies because SB21 requires a minimum 12-month average market capitalization of $500 billion. Ethereum could join later if its market cap consistently meets this threshold. What impact might Texas’s crypto policies have on institutional interest in Bitcoin? Texas’s proactive crypto policies could significantly boost institutional interest in Bitcoin by legitimizing it as a reserve asset, potentially encouraging other states and large entities to follow suit.",News|Bitcoin|Bitcoin Reserve,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-21 05:36:24

Market Bulls Stay Confident,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/wall-street-ponke-pepeto-eth-crypto-trends/,"The post Ethereum Price Outlook: Will ETH Reach $10K in 2025? Market Bulls Stay Confident appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Whales Betting Big on Ethereum Ethereum is now hovering around $2,560 (see updated price here ), and optimism is building fast. A single whale just bought 48,825 ETH for $127 million, averaging $2,605 per token. This happened during a brief dip in price, reinforcing confidence in Ethereum’s longer-term strength. That same wallet is believed to have banked $30 million from previous Ethereum trades, proving this wasn’t a random move. As over 242,000 ETH options expired and the put-call ratio stayed at 1.20, signs of stability are returning, and some expect a major breakout soon. ETH Price Prediction: $10,000 May Not Be Far Off Analyst Ted Pillows is watching closely. He notes four consecutive green candles on Ethereum’s two-week chart a pattern that looks a lot like Bitcoin’s setup just before the 2020 bull market. His forecast? Ethereum may break above $10,000 by year-end. MerlijnTrader supports the idea, calling Ethereum the next major opportunity for anyone who missed Bitcoin’s rally. With prices fluctuating between $2,400 and $2,750, many believe ETH is simply charging up for its next big run.

The breach involved the injection of malicious JavaScript code into the site’s rotating “Doodles” feature, asking users to “verify wallet,” a pop-up meant to steal their funds. According to an on-chain analyst going by the pseudonym okHOTSHOT on X, the malicious code was delivered through manipulated JSON files served via CoinMarketCap’s own backend API. The data was used to load animated “doodles” on the front page. When one doodle titled “CoinmarketCLAP,” was loaded, it silently executed JavaScript that redirected users to a wallet drainer dubbed “Impersonator,” a deceptive interface to trick them into authorizing token transfers. The attack was not immediately apparent to all users because the site rotated doodles randomly per visit. Yet, visiting the /doodles/ endpoint reportedly triggered the wallet drainer on every occasion. Blockchain investigators identified a known malicious address receiving token approvals: 0x000025b5ab50f8d9f987feb52eee7479e34a0000. 🚨 CoinMarketCap is Hacked 🚨 POV: you are getting drained (don't try this at home) 👇 pic.twitter.com/cgQhmFkATO — apoorv.eth (@apoorveth) June 20, 2025 Security experts believe the attack may have exploited a vulnerability in the animation engine used to render the doodles, likely Lottie or a similar tool, allowing arbitrary JavaScript execution through the JSON configuration. According to analysts at Coinspect, attackers appeared to have backend access and set an expiration time on the exploit, which could have been planned in advance. CoinMarketCap gave a public statement on the breach through their official X account, saying: “ We’ve identified and removed the malicious code from our site. Our team is continuing to investigate and taking steps to strengthen our security. ” The company added that the affected pop-up has been removed and systems are fully restored. Although the attack targeted only the front-end interface, security professionals are pleading with investors to be cautious about access to their wallets. CoinMarketCap is a platform many crypto traders and investors visit on a minute-by-minute basis. “ The scale of this scam could be huge, it looks totally legit, no obvious red flag s,” one trader reckoned on social media. “ You’re just visiting a site you check daily. Take care out there .” Experts also believe that users who connected their wallets or approved transactions during the breach window may have already been compromised. As a precaution, those who fell for the malicious requests are advised to revoke any recent token approvals and avoid interacting with similar pop-ups across crypto-related platforms. As reported by Cryptopolitan on Thursday, one of the largest known data breaches in internet history also took place this week. Over 16 billion usernames and passwords were supposedly leaked. BitoPro confirms $11M crypto theft by Lazarus Group In other related news, Taiwanese cryptocurrency exchange BitoPro confirmed a breach resulting in the theft of approximately $11 million in digital assets. The company linked the attack to the North Korean state-backed hacking group Lazarus. According to an X thread published on June 19, it cited similarities to previous incidents involving illicit international fund transfers and unauthorized access to crypto exchanges. The breach occurred on May 8, 2025, during a routine hot wallet system update. Attackers exploited an employee device to bypass multi-factor authentication using stolen AWS session tokens. Malware implanted via a social engineering attack enabled the hackers to execute commands, inject scripts into the wallet system, and simulate legitimate activity while siphoning funds. Assets were drained across multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, and Tron, and laundered through decentralized exchanges and mixers such as Tornado Cash, Wasabi Wallet, and ThorChain.

Why top investors are entering now: Capped Supply: No risk of inflation or stealth minting Staking Rewards: Passive income model already running Verified Code: Full audit completed for trust assurance Decentralized Control: No VC manipulation, all community-led On-Chain Patterns: Low churn, growing wallet concentration Bonus Active: PATRIOTS100X giving early entrants added leverage Chainlink (LINK) Eyes Continuation Above $16 Chainlink recently bounced back, surging to $15.30 and currently trading near $15.80–$16.50. The move came after strong integration news involving SWIFT and JPMorgan, pushing bullish forecasts toward $20–$25 if momentum sustains. Still, with LINK approaching key resistance, some short-term traders are locking in gains and reallocating to smaller-cap assets with higher near-term upside. Polkadot (DOT) Rises on Elastic Scaling Buzz Polkadot is testing the $4.40–$4.80 range following a 16% weekly gain, driven by anticipation around its June 2025 Elastic Scaling rollout. If DOT breaks above $5.00, analysts believe it could reach $8–$10 by year-end. For now, the token is showing strength but hasn’t fully confirmed a longer-term breakout, leading cautious capital to diversify elsewhere. Polygon (MATIC) Rebounds During PoS Transition Polygon is currently trading between $0.21 and $0.28 amid major structural changes, including the transition from MATIC to POL. With Polygon 2.0 and AggLayer v3.0 aiming for massive TPS boosts and better cross-chain liquidity, long-term interest remains strong. However, the short-term price has yet to reflect those changes, keeping speculative capital on standby. Cardano (ADA) Drifts Amid Governance Uncertainty Cardano is hovering around $0.63 following a 26% year-to-date decline. The treasury debate over reallocating 140 million ADA has caused unease within the community. While the Chang hard fork and Hydra upgrade offer long-term promise, ADA’s price action is subdued, and many traders are looking toward more active growth opportunities. Final Thoughts With Chainlink, Polkadot, Polygon, and Cardano navigating technical hurdles, the quiet accumulation of MAGACOIN FINANCE by large holders may signal where the next breakout truly begins.

Bolstered by some serious ecosystem development and a new wave of institutional interest, the Layer 1 blockchain platform is expected to rally, with many technical indicators whispering a potential 20% jump just around the corner. With a mix of decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and downright boring enterprise solutions, Avalanche seems built for both short- and long-term yield. Yet savvy analysts say to look past the obvious trades—the obvious altcoins in your portfolio—to find opportunities elsewhere. What do they mean? This chase has directed analysts and investors toward an ever-growing recognition of the potential for the rapidly rising Neo Pepe Coin —a cryptocurrency project inspired by memes, which is now rapidly gaining traction due to a substantial amount of on-chain engagement and its uniquely community-driven governance model. With what seems to be an intelligently structured presale, some innovative governance features, and a strategic approach to tokenomics that is designed for both scarcity and long-term growth, Neo Pepe Coin is rapidly making its way to the forefront for investors looking to diversify their portfolios with one of the best crypto presale s, and achieve maximum returns come 2025. AVAX Rally Faces $NEOP’s Rising Momentum While AVAX keeps on profiting from its flourishing ecosystem and interest from institutions, Neo Pepe Coin ($NEOP) is making its own distinct mark in the crypto space, a mark that’s now clearer than ever thanks to Stage 4 of its presale being live and the presale having already raised over $1.3 million. On top of that, impressive as those figures are, what the presale has seemed to accomplish in really pushing the community aspect of Neo Pepe Coin to the fore is what has gotten a lot of people talking about it lately. How On-Chain Metrics Are Shaping 2025 Growth Forecasts In 2025, savvy investors have increasingly relied on crucial on-chain metrics to inform their investment strategies: Wallet Participation: A strong indication of user adoption and ongoing interest. Transaction Frequency: Highlights active use and consistent engagement within the network. Smart Contract Interactions: Reflects deeper utility and substantial user trust. Community Voting Power: A critical metric reflecting genuine decentralization and governance health. Sophisticated investors now value authentic decentralization and the active use of governance tools over simple market speculation. Neo Pepe Coin stands out with its well-structured DAO system, demonstrating a compelling model of community involvement and transparent decision-making that significantly boosts investor confidence. These innovative functions help position NEOP as a contender for best crypto presale of the year. Neo Pepe Coin Is Outperforming AVAX in Early Engagement While Avalanche primarily utilizes institutional partnerships and expansion into high-level ecosystem areas, Neo Pepe Coin attracts engagement at the grassroots level by directly empowering users. In contrast to the centralized development of Avalanche, the Neo Pepe Coin hands control to community members through on-chain governance mechanisms. The token holders actively direct the Coin’s trajectory, submitting their own proposals and managing the treasury allocations—activities that make up the maintenance of loyalty and a sustained, if not increased, level of participation. The presale that is now taking place has already shown a significant increase in the number of on-chain interactions (and thus is making waves in the memecoin community) through the DAO token voting process. This Interactive Presale Draws Strong Early Buyers Much of the presale success of Neo Pepe Coin can be attributed to its innovative leaderboard system, which serves to gamify community engagement. Participants are encouraged to compete and to contribute in a meaningful way throughout the different presale stages. Doing so can earn you exclusive airdrops and rewards. This kind of sustained, gamified involvement really sets Neo Pepe Coin apart from standard-issue early-stage token sales and is doin’ a heckuva job right now at energizing and deepening community engagement. BITGIRL CRYPTO’s Analysis on Rising Coin Star In their latest video, crypto influencer BITGIRL CRYPTO explores the buzz surrounding Neo Pepe’s presale. Their key takeaway? The project is working hard to distinguish itself in the overcrowded meme-token market, and it might well succeed. That is quite a tempting proposition. But what makes meme-token Neo Pepe any different from the meme tokens that have come before it and have largely failed? In what ways is its presale better (or worse), and what can you expect, if anything, in terms of price action once the presale is done? BITGIRL CRYPTO’s beenaded video serves as a decent introduction to what Neo Pepe is about and why, if you are thinking about investing in it, now might be a good time. AVAX Eyes Short-Term Gains—$NEOP Targets Long-Term Potential Although Avalanche is poised for short-term technical gains, many investors are shifting their focus to projects offering immediate involvement coupled with assured long-term value. Neo Pepe Coin uniquely meets these criteria through its immutable smart contract design, eliminating developer-side risks such as unilateral changes or potential exploits, yet a few more reasons this could be the best crypto presale to emerge in recent times. This locked-in architecture enhances investor confidence, attracting those prioritizing transparency, fairness, and long-term potential over fleeting market rallies.

Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Has Reset Back To Neutral The “Fear & Greed Index” refers to an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the average sentiment present among the traders in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. Related Reading: Dogecoin Gears Up For 60% Move—Will It Be Up Or Down? The index makes use of the data of these five factors in order to determine the trader mentality: trading volume, market cap dominance, volatility, social media sentiment, and Google Trends. The indicator represents the calculated sentiment as a score lying between zero and hundred. Values above the 54 mark correspond to the dominance of greed in the market, while those below 46 to presence of fear among the investors. All values lying between these cutoffs correlate to a net neutral sentiment. Now, here is how the mood in the Bitcoin market is like right now according to the Fear & Greed Index: As is visible above, the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index has a value of 54 at the moment, which suggests the investors hold a neutral sentiment, although one that’s right on the edge of turning into greed. The recent neutral mentality in the sector has come following a phase of greed among the traders, as the below chart shows. As displayed in the graph, the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index spiked to a high of 72 earlier in the month as the asset’s price gave investors hope that its consolidation phase might be coming to an end. As the recovery rally has fizzled out and the coin has returned to its range, however, optimism among the investors has predictably faded. If history is to go by, though, this development may not actually be so bad for the cryptocurrency. Generally, digital asset markets tend to move in a way that goes contrary to the expectations of the majority. The probability of such an opposite move taking place goes up the more extreme the crowd opinion becomes. Besides the three core sentiments, there are two special regions known as the extreme fear (under 25) and extreme greed (above 75). These zones are where the likelihood of a contrary move has been the strongest in the past, with tops and bottoms often taking form. Although the market sentiment has recently only seen a reset to the neutral territory, the fact that the investors are no longer greedy could still be a positive for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. There have been many instances in the past where a dip into the neutral zone was enough for the bull run to regain momentum.

This paves the way for Texas to formalize a strategic Bitcoin investment program . Still , Governor Abbott has yet to weigh in on SB21, a bill permitting state investment in cryptocurrencies with at least a market capitalization of $500 billion. So far, only Bitcoin meets the criteria. Texas Governor Abbott has yet to approve or reject the SB21 bill The House Bill 4488 protects the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, the Texas Advanced Nuclear Development Fund, and the Gulf Coast Protection Account. That means the funds will remain established or maintained as distinct entities within or outside the state treasury, as defined by their enabling laws. However, creating the state’s Bitcoin Reserve hinges on signing SB21 or a comparable bill. If the legislation is signed, then the fund would fall under the legal protections outlined in HB4488. SB21 was submitted to the governor on June 1, giving him until June 22 to sign or veto it. If he takes no action by then, the bill will automatically become law. New Hampshire and Arizona approved their Bitcoin Reserve bills New Hampshire , Arizona, and Texas are among the first states to approve state-level Bitcoin Reserves. Although several other states introduced similar bills in recent months, most failed to advance due to lawmakers’ reluctance over concerns of Bitcoin’s volatility and long-term viability as a reserve asset. Arizona’s Senate also recently passed HB 2324 in a 16-14 vote, a bill that could see the expansion of the state’s crypto infrastructure. The bill is now back in the House for a final decision. If passed, the bill would amend Arizona’s forfeiture laws to permit the state to treat abandoned digital assets as unclaimed property. Arizona’s House also passed Senate Bill 1025 (SB1025), which stipulated that seized funds could be invested in Bitcoin. However, Governor Katie Hobbs vetoed it. She wrote: The Arizona State Retirement System is one of the strongest in the nation because it makes sound and informed investments. Arizonans’ retirement funds are not the place for the state to try untested investments like virtual currencу. Governor Katie Hobbs Michigan also introduced four new pro-crypto bills. The first would permit the state’s retirement fund to hold Bitcoin, while the second bill targets CBDCs, calling for a statewide ban and enhanced financial privacy protections. The other two bills are centered on BTC mining, including benefits for those operating on abandoned oil and gas wells. New Hampshire passed HB 302 into law, allowing the state treasurer to purchase Bitcoin and other digital assets with a market cap above $500 billion. The state also maintains a 5% cap on Bitcoin and digital assets to ensure crypto remains complementary.

According to recent price data , top analysts are renewing calls for a massive XRP rally. One analyst, who famously called the token’s 600% move in a past cycle, is once again predicting a sharp surge—this time with a $10 target. What’s driving this? Institutional demand is climbing, legal clarity is improving, and XRP is forming a familiar bullish pattern. A wave of on-chain activity has returned, and if historical patterns hold, XRP could be primed for a parabolic move in 2025. Analyst Cites XRP’s History of Explosive Breakouts The $10 target isn’t without precedent. XRP has a track record of long consolidation periods followed by sudden price explosions. According to the analyst, this current setup closely mirrors previous rallies that delivered massive returns in short timeframes. Combined with the possibility of a spot ETF and improving sentiment around Ripple’s legal battle, bullish momentum is intensifying. With renewed excitement in the XRP camp, attention is also turning to high-upside altcoin projects showing early strength.

Will the Memecoin Rally or Retreat? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News PEPE, one of the most volatile memecoins, is currently navigating a critical juncture on the charts. After peaking at $0.000028 in late 2024, the asset has entered a corrective phase, now hovering near $0.00001. Technicals suggest a shift in momentum, with the RSI dipping below neutral levels and the MACD signaling bearish divergence. As whale movements and profit-taking weigh on price action, it would be interesting to watch the next course of action of the PEPE price rally! On the daily chart, PEPE has lost momentum after repeated rejections near the $0.000012 resistance zone. This level has formed a short-term ceiling, with each rally attempt being met with selling pressure. Meanwhile, the tokens sustain a bullish pattern, which hints towards a potential upswing; however, securing levels above $0.000011 is very important. As bearish clouds may continue to haunt the rally until then. PEPE price has printed a clear falling wedge pattern with multiple bounces on both support and resistance. Price is hovering near the wedge apex while holding just above a key support zone below $0.00001. A bullish breakout would likely send it toward the $0.0000135 to $0.000014 resistance zone where previous liquidity pooled. While the RSI has displayed a bullish divergence, the Ichimoku cloud raises some concerns. The conversion line has plunged and maintains a steep descending trend while the cloud has flipped to bearish. This suggests the PEPE price continues to face significant selling pressure while the volume is lowering consistently. On the other hand, the MACD also flipped bearish with a declining histogram, indicating waning bullish strength. Therefore, if the support breaks, the support at $0.000095 could be tested, or else a bullish continuation could help price reclaim $0.0000115 to $0.000012.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|TRADING|PEPE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-21 06:56:16

Using what he refers to as the RGB arcs, the chart builds on multi-year macro patterns to project potential future price action. The RGB arcs are a layered set of red, green, and blue arcs tracking historical resistance and support zones. Rather than focusing solely on short-term fluctuations, the chart references XRP’s past performance, notably the parabolic surge in 2017-2018, to draw parallels with the current market structure. According to the chart, XRP underwent a similar pattern of consolidation just before its explosive rally in 2017. Back then, six-month candles formed before the market broke upward. Currently, XRP has printed seven such candles in a tight formation, suggesting a comparable setup is unfolding. #XRP – RGB ARCHS (Red-Green-Blue) & Kaboom: Back in 2017, it took just 6 candles before the final leg launched .

The analyst notes, “It took just 6 candles before the final leg launched” in the last cycle, and XRP is now sitting at the 7-candle mark. This observation leads to the conclusion that a high-volatility move, described as the “KABOOM Phase,” could be imminent. Notably, EGRAG CRYPTO recently pointed to a potential inverted hammer formation that could support this massive bullish run and laid out the requirements for XRP to complete that pattern. The digital asset has multiple technical indicators pointing toward a bull run in the short term, and the analyst maintains confidence in the asset’s long-term trajectory, noting the “measured move is clear” and that XRP is headed for his outlined target zones. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Projected Targets and Timeline The three arcs highlighted on the chart are as follows: the lowest (red) represents foundational support, a middle set (green) that reflects prior breakout levels, and the upper arc (blue), which projects higher targets based on previous cycles. He expects this climb to begin on July 1 and recently predicted that the asset will hit its cycle peak on July 21 . Based on his analysis, the upper targets for this run lie between $22 and $27, with a maximum projection near $38. EGRAG CRYPTO has reiterated the $27 target for years, and his target range of $22 to $28 is significantly higher than XRP’s current price of $2.15. The analyst recently highlighted a green mega candle that could send the asset to around $27, and many market participants are confident in this imminent bull run.

The meeting, which involved the US Crypto Tax Force, focused on DTCC tokenization services, among other issues. ETF Store President Nate Geraci shared the development on X, noting that it is a massive bullish signal for the tokenization sector. DTCC is a capital markets infrastructure firm providing financial institutions with settlement, clearing, and trade reporting services. The firm occupies a central role in the US and global financial markets with $3 quadrillion in settlement value for 2023 alone, making it the biggest financial processor in the world. According to the agenda shared on X, SEC and DTCC examined the preliminary base of DTCC tokenization services, looking at operational flow, technology, design controls, token usage, and other issues. They also discussed how the tokenization service will evolve and the regulatory impact on the service, such as which laws would apply and where exemptions can be obtained, especially when clearing agency obligations. The firm has already announced plans to launch a platform for tokenized collateral management in April, noting that the blockchain platform will run within its AppChain ecosystem and optimize collateral movements in the financial markets. DTCC has been working on a tokenization platform for more than five years and tested a pilot last year in collaboration with 13 participants using the Canton Network. At the time, the firm tested ten use cases and found that tokenization could help improve liquidity and collateral optimization. DTCC doubles down on blockchain technology and crypto-related moves Meanwhile, the recent discussions with the SEC only show the firm is doubling down on its crypto-related integrations. In the past few months, reports have surfaced that DTCC plans to integrate stablecoin into its platform. According to The Information, DTCC is developing its stablecoin. While there is no official confirmation from the firm, it recently released a blog post on using stablecoins as a settlement asset in payments and cross-border transactions. It also stated that it is observing the regulatory developments from the regulatory agencies and the US Congress, and assessing its options, including the possibility of launching a stablecoin if it helps improve its core services. Interestingly, the firm crypto and tokenization efforts have been in the works for years. In 2023, it bought an institutional-grade blockchain tech firm, Securrency, and has been experimenting with tokenization as far back as 2020. The firm’s bullishness on tokenization was evident in its recent Congressional testimony, where its head of Digital Asset, Nadine Chakar, said that tokenization is the next step in simplifying complex financial processes. DTCC has also joined the ERC3643 Association, a non-profit aiming to make the Ethereum token the standard for tokenized securities. Tokenization efforts are growing Meanwhile, DTCC is not the only firm engaged with the SEC on tokenization. In fact, several financial institutions, both TradFi and crypto-focused, have recently turned their attention to the sector. Coinbase recently sought the SEC’s approval to offer tokenized stocks on its platform in a move that could see it come closer to traditional brokerage firms. The chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, confirmed this even as it is unclear whether the exchange filed an official request or simply asked for guidance. The crypto exchange is now waiting on the SEC to say, which could significantly impact how the sector evolves. Presently, tokenized securities are not legal in the US. However, the current SEC administration, particularly the crypto task force, has shown strong interest in enabling tokenization even as regulations evolve. Some firms are not waiting on the SEC, with Kraken and Bybit launching tokenized securities in other jurisdictions. Meanwhile, the massive interest in tokenized real-world assets (RWA) continues to drive the market performance. The total value of onchain RWA recently crossed the $24 billion milestone after an almost 6% increase in the last 30 days. The number of asset holders also increased by 99% to over 204,000.

With its final sale phase approaching, buyers are moving fast to secure early positions. While Cardano, NEAR Protocol, Kaspa, and Arbitrum hold their ground in technical zones, it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE that’s capturing short-term urgency and long-term interest. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Urgency Sets In as Final Entry Window Narrows With its sale window entering its final stretch, MAGACOIN FINANCE is attracting a flood of new buyers looking to get in before listings go live. The project has captured momentum across crypto forums, analytics groups, and seasoned trading desks — and it’s easy to see why. Key elements driving this surge: Capped Supply: 170 billion tokens — fixed forever Live Staking: Early holders are already earning rewards HashEx Audit: Full technical audit completed and verified Zero VC Control: 100% community-led from inception On-Chain Growth: Rising holder count, declining sell pressure Promo Active: The PATRIOTS100X bonus is giving final-stage buyers an added incentive This isn’t speculation anymore — it’s positioning. And the window to enter at early prices is closing fast. Cardano (ADA) Struggles Below Key Resistance Cardano continues to face downward pressure, currently hovering near $0.63–$0.65 after dropping 26% year-to-date. Community debates over treasury allocation and liquidity incentives have weighed on sentiment. Unless ADA regains $0.70 and broader altcoin momentum lifts, sideways action may persist. Traders watching for high-velocity moves are increasingly shifting focus elsewhere. NEAR Protocol Shows Steady Growth, Weak Price Action NEAR is advancing its infrastructure with new web3 partnerships and integrations. Yet despite fundamental progress, the token’s price remains muted. NEAR’s long-term potential is still intact, but without a major headline or breakout catalyst, it’s not commanding trader attention in the short term. Accumulation may continue quietly, but high-volume activity has shifted toward faster-moving alternatives. Kaspa (KAS) Holds Niche, But Volume Thins Kaspa remains an outlier in the infrastructure-focused altcoin segment. Its unique technical model continues to draw loyal followers, but with limited headline traction and no fresh upgrades this month, KAS is mostly trading sideways. While long-term holders remain confident, new capital appears to be flowing into more dynamic setups like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Arbitrum (ARB) Maintains Relevance Without Rally Arbitrum is still a cornerstone in the Layer 2 space, benefiting from developer activity and institutional attention. But price-wise, ARB is caught below key resistance levels, with trading volume softening since early June. Until a bullish trigger emerges — either via on-chain metrics or major adoption news — ARB may struggle to generate upside pressure. Final Thoughts While Cardano, NEAR, Kaspa, and Arbitrum each face different market challenges, it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE that’s commanding the spotlight. With structure, urgency, and reward alignment all pointing in its favor, traders aren’t hesitating — they’re acting.

The scheme involved popular tokens like SUI, NEAR, Axelar, SEI, and many others, with over $50 million reportedly stolen. The scam went unnoticed for months and targeted big names in the crypto space, including venture capitalists, key opinion leaders (KOLs), and major crypto whales.

Time to expose wallets and screenshots. pic.twitter.com/jTTKYfb8WW — Altcoin Alpha (@AltcoinAlphaOnX) June 20, 2025 Gaining Trust It all started with what looked like Tier-1 OTC deals shared in Telegram groups by VC circles and private investors. The deals promised tokens of high-profile projects like Graph, Aptos, SEI, and SWELL at discounts of up to 50% with a 4 to 5-month vesting period. The initial deals were executed perfectly to build trust. Investors started investing larger amounts, and were convinced but its smooth process and growing hype. Further, Telegram groups saw a rise in OTC deals involving high-profile tokens and still offered deep discounts same vesting terms. Ignored Warnings But by 2025, there were signs of trouble. Eman Abio from the SUI team warned on X, saying clearly: “There is NO deal!” Lucian Mincu of MultiversX also issued similar alerts. But despite these public warnings, most investors didn’t listen. The money kept flowing in, even as the cracks widened. The Collapse (June 2025) The scam finally fell apart on June 1, when the final deal offering Fluid tokens was introduced. Soon after, token distributions from earlier deals suddenly stopped. Investors were given excuses like claims of travel issues, exchange problems, and KYC delays. On June 19, Aza Ventures, the main VC group behind many deals, said that they had also been scammed. They revealed that their main contact, “Source 1,” had been running a Ponzi scheme, using new investor money to pay earlier investors. It got worse when Aza said their other sources, “Source 2” and “Source 3,” were also getting deals from Source 1. The entire setup collapsed fast, and the full scale of the scam was finally exposed. Who is The Culprit? According to Aza Ventures, “Source 1” is of Indian origin and the founder of a project listed on Binance. Aza Ventures is negotiating with Source 1 to recover funds, with a deadline set for month-end. In a latest update, Ravindra Kumar, now identified as “Source 1,” denies all wrongdoing and says that a full statement is coming. But Aza Ventures claims he ran a Ponzi scheme and moved $24.5M through wallets now linked to Binance. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Shiba Inu Exec Warns: Scammers Are Targeting Crypto Users on X! , Aza says only $100K remains, and he is counting on future token launches to repay victims.

He also pointed out that teams like Sui and MultiversX already gave early warnings. This case serves as a stark warning of the dangers related to unregulated OTC trading on platforms like Telegram. Despite the warning signs, trust and social hype made the scam convincing. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Despite warnings, investors were swayed by initial successful deals, deep discounts, and strong social hype, leading them to overlook red flags and trust the seemingly legitimate process. What regulatory or legal recourse do victims have, given the cross-border and pseudonymous nature of the scam? Victims can report to national cybercrime units and potentially pursue legal action under cybercrime laws, though cross-border and anonymous aspects make recovery challenging. Could the scam have been detected earlier with better on-chain monitoring or transparency? Yes, enhanced on-chain monitoring, coupled with off-chain data analysis and AI, could have potentially identified suspicious transaction patterns and red flags earlier.",News|Hack,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|BNB|EGLD,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-21 07:02:13

Since the beginning of the year, researchers at Cybernews have been thumbing through “supermassive datasets” that contain at least 16 billion records of login information for social media, VPNs, developer portals, corporate platforms and much more. The researchers say “no stone was left unturned.” “This is not just a leak – it’s a blueprint for mass exploitation. With over 16 billion login records exposed, cybercriminals now have unprecedented access to personal credentials that can be used for account takeover, identity theft, and highly targeted phishing. What’s especially concerning is the structure and recency of these datasets – these aren’t just old breaches being recycled. This is fresh, weaponizable intelligence at scale.” The experts say that some of the datasets were labeled with vague names like “logins” or “credentials,” not giving much of a hint as to what was inside the files. However, other datasets were more specific with their labeling. According to the researchers, one dataset’s name suggested it was linked to the Russian Federation and had over 455 million records inside. Another was named after Telegram, the encrypted messaging app. “The inclusion of both old and recent infostealer logs – often with tokens, cookies, and metadata – makes this data particularly dangerous for organizations lacking multi-factor authentication or credential hygiene practices,” Bob Diachenko, a cybersecurity researcher and a contributor to Cybernews, is responsible for the discovery. Diachenko clarified that there was “no centralized data breach” of the aforementioned tech companies. Rather, the information was likely extracted using infostealers and then leaked onto the dark web. Researcher Aras Nazarovas said that the discovery might be evidence that cybercriminals have abandoned their old techniques of stealing data, and moving onto more sophisticated methods. “The increased number of exposed infostealer datasets in the form of centralized, traditional databases, like the ones found by the Cybernews research team, may be a sign, that cybercriminals are actively shifting from previously popular alternatives such as Telegram groups, which were previously the go-to place for obtaining data collected by infostealer malware.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

As Dogecoin and Shiba Inu prepare for another potential bull run, investors are eager to see which of these popular coins will break past previous all-time highs. Dive into the dynamics of these two digital assets and uncover which one might be poised for explosive growth. Dogecoin Market Snapshot: Past Decline and Key Levels Overview Over the past month, Dogecoin lost nearly 24.84% of its value, while in the last six months, it declined by about 46.76%. The coin has experienced consistent downward movement, with technical indicators showing negative readings. Such figures indicate that the cryptocurrency remains in a prolonged bearish phase, with market sentiment negatively affected by ongoing pressure. Price volatility and declining momentum have characterized recent activity, creating an environment marked by frequent retracements and heightened investor caution. Currently, Dogecoin is trading between $0.15 and $0.25, with support at $0.11 and resistance around $0.30. The price is confined within a narrow range, and technical indicators reflect a cautious outlook. The Relative Strength Index near 35 suggests oversold conditions, while bearish signals from both the Awesome Oscillator and Momentum Indicator reinforce bearish pressure. The market lacks a clear upward trend, despite potential for short-term rallies. Traders might target buying near support if resilience is shown or selling near resistance for minor retracements. Secondary support is at $0.01, with resistance near $0.39, providing additional reference points for trading strategies in this uncertain market. Shiba Inu Endures Volatility as Bears Hold the Line Shiba Inu has recently faced notable declines, with a one-week drop of -10.90% contributing to broader losses. The coin's price has decreased by -21.08% over the past month, and a sustained downturn of -48.69% over the last six months highlights ongoing weakness. These performance metrics reflect consistent selling pressure in the market, with minimal signs of a recovery, portraying a period characterized by continued declines rather than stabilization. Currently, Shiba Inu is trading within a narrow range between $0.00001 and $0.00002. The nearest resistance is at $0.00002, with an additional barrier at $0.00003. Support is identified at $0.00001, with further backup around $0.000003. Technical indicators show a bearish sentiment, with an Awesome Oscillator reading of -0.00000149 and an RSI of 34.65. This price action suggests sideways movement with no clear trend. Traders may consider testing the support at $0.00001 for potential rebounds, but caution is advised for any further breakdown. Short-term trades within this range could offer opportunities, focusing on resistance as exit points. Conclusion DOGE has a strong foundation and widespread recognition. SHIB , on the other hand, has built a passionate community and ambitious projects. Both coins have unique strengths and devoted followers. Overcoming previous highs will depend on various factors, including market trends and broader adoption. DOGE has the advantage of being a pioneer, while SHIB’s innovations can drive interest. Only time will reveal which memecoin can achieve new peaks in this bull run. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Rapid Presale Momentum Says Yes!,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/could-neo-pepe-coin-claim-title-of-best-pepe-coin-rapid-presale-momentum-says-yes/,"Neo Pepe Coin Gains $1.3 Million in Stage 4 Presale, Fuels Speculation as Next Top Pepe Coin Neo Pepe’s presale has swiftly surged past the $1.3 million mark at a stage 4 token price of $0.07592, quickly capturing investor attention as potentially the best Pepe coin successor. Built upon decentralized governance through its robust DAO and backed by transparent treasury controls, Neo Pepe Coin represents a revolutionary shift in meme coin dynamics. The innovative tokenomics, coupled with active community involvement, position Neo Pepe as an emerging powerhouse among meme coins typically driven solely by hype. As momentum continues to grow, market watchers closely track if Neo Pepe can replicate and sustain the incredible influence and market performance once promised by the original PEPE. Why PEPE’s Meme Coin Legacy is Under Threat Pepe Coin ($PEPE) started almost two years ago on the internet as a meme. But now its not-so-little former meme is a hefty player in the crypto world. The Pepe Coin community (which has manifested largely on social media like Twitter and Discord) has seen crypto culture intimately blended with internet culture. The former is nothing new, as every byproduct of crypto memes is testament to that. What makes the Pepe Coin a special case—especially now that 2025 is nearly halfway over and we have the meme-wrapped, mobbed-up monetary token that is now a $10 billion market cap, half real, half potential— is how close the self-aware Pepe Coin community might be to the community responsible for, say, the titan that is Bitcoin. Neo Pepe Coin’s Explosive Presale Success Why is the presale momentum of Neo Pepe considered one of the best crypto presales of 2025? It is structured into 16 presale stages that reward early adopters with significantly lower prices. The price increases at every stage motivate investors to engage as early as possible, and the limited allocations at every stage create a sense of urgency and exclusivity that pushes potential buyers to act. Furthermore, Neo Pepe encourages active community involvement by rewarding not just frequent buyers but also those who help spread the word with leaderboard points, turning our all but quiet community into a gamified one. The leaderboard itself is something of a masterpiece; it not only serves as a token of appreciation to our most loyal community members but also factors in daily trading volume when determining points. Why daily trading volume? Because it incentivizes community members to trade daily, and that, in turn, girds the floor for Neo Pepe tokens. The gamified leaderboard in Neo Pepe creates a sustained participatory experience that is exciting and competitive, working equally well as a collaborative and community bonding mechanism—”glue”—for Neo Pepe that makes it a significantly more appealing project. Neo Pepe’s DAO— Full Community Control Neo Pepe’s decentralized autonomous organization structure, reinforced with the NEOPGovernor smart contract, sets Neo Pepe apart from its competitors by giving true decision-making power to $NEOP token holders. If you hold $NEOP, and especially if you hold 1 million tokens or more, you can submit proposals for the community to consider. Period. No intermediary. No filter. This is the way Neo Pepe’s governance works. And believe it or not, governance in the DeFi world can be and often is this straightforward. This truly decentralized governance model ensures developers have no unilateral control once the protocol is live, significantly enhancing transparency and trust in the Neo Pepe ecosystem. Crypto Volt Goes Off Script on Neo Pepe Coin In a cryptocurrency universe teeming with shallow insights and recycled enthusiasm, Crypto Volt stands tall, offering a clearly written and direct critique of Neo Pepe that manages to say the quiet parts aloud. And part and parcel of that viscerally engaging critique is this: rather than blindly hailing the ambitious 16-stage presale as some sort of hype-delivering contraption, Volt disassembles it—revealing the presale, in the process, to be something that Neo Pepe’s creators hope will bring them real, steady investor commitment and not just the customary burst of meme coin enthusiasm. Note also Volt’s, quite frankly, unusual willingness to engage in a heady appraisal of Neo Pepe’s built-in auto-liquidity generating system. This mechanism, says Volt, is something that could genuinely change the game for market stability. 3 Reasons These Advanced Tokenomics Are Exceptional Neo Pepe Coin, built on Ethereum’s secure ERC-20 standard with rigorously audited smart contracts, prioritizes trust and investor confidence. Here are three key aspects: Auto-Liquidity Mechanism : A sophisticated feature that directs 2.5% of each transaction into Uniswap liquidity pools, permanently burning liquidity provider tokens. This reduces circulating supply and maintains price stability. Sustainable Token Allocation : Clearly defined total supply capped at 1 billion tokens with explicit allocations for marketing, ecosystem incentives, giveaways, liquidity pools, and development, promoting investor trust. Transparent Financial Management : Community-controlled treasury ensures complete transparency in all financial operations, empowering token holders directly through governance votes. Why Investors Say This Presale is Crypto’s Next Big Thing Blending meme culture with advanced financial infrastructure, Neo Pepe has generated considerable excitement among investors as a strong contender for best crypto presale of the year. Its transparent governance model, secure treasury management, and robust tokenomics redefine meme coin expectations.

Ondo (ONDO) and Polymesh (POLYX) offer distinct strategies to integrate real-world value into blockchain ecosystems. Readers will uncover the unique methods each employs and gain insights into which might be poised for significant growth. Ondo Price Trend: Recent Decline and Key Levels in Focus Ondo experienced a notable drop of around 17% over the past month, with a steep decline of nearly 57% over the last six months. The one-week change indicates a decrease of approximately 11.5%, reflecting a consistent downtrend in both the short and long term. During this period, price action remained within a range of about $0.70 to $1.05. Cumulative data points illustrate a prevailing bearish sentiment in the market, leading to reduced momentum that has hindered upward movement. This historical performance has actively contributed to the current trend observed in the figures. Current price levels remain confined within a range of about $0.70 to $1.05, with immediate support near $0.57 and resistance close to $1.27. Bears continue to dominate as key indicators, such as momentum and oscillator measurements, linger in negative territory, with the RSI around 39. This range signals active trading, though there is no clear bullish trend. Traders may consider waiting for a breakout above $1.27 or testing the $0.57 support for potential buying opportunities while maintaining close attention to price actions and employing tight risk management strategies amid uncertain market conditions. Polymesh Faces Bearish Momentum Amid Significant Price Declines Polymesh shows a history of rapid declines over recent time frames. Within one month, the coin lost 22% of its value, reflecting sharp pressure on its pricing. Over the past six months, the drop of 54% underscores persistent bearish trends that challenge investor sentiment. A week’s performance saw a 10% decline, placing additional strain on the coin’s reputation. The downward movements have left Polymesh vulnerable amidst market volatility, with price corrections accelerating. Historic patterns point to a wave of selling pressure that has permeated the market, charting a clear negative trajectory. The current trading range for Polymesh is defined by a price band between $0.11 and $0.18, with immediate support at $0.09 and resistance at $0.23. Trading activity reflects a persistent bearish tone, as both the Awesome Oscillator and Momentum Indicator register negative readings. The RSI value at 36.74 further underscores the downward sentiment. Technical recommendations lean toward caution, with indicators suggesting short-term pressures may continue. A bounce near the $0.09 support could offer an entry point for a brief rally, while a drop below support may drive prices down to a secondary floor at $0.02. Bears dominate the market, but opportunities exist in short-term fluctuations, emphasizing cautious, risk-managed entries. Conclusion ONDO and POLYX represent distinct methods for handling real-world assets. ONDO focuses on creating financial tools that integrate with traditional markets. POLYX aims to enhance security and compliance through its custom blockchain. Each has strengths tailored to different users. ONDO offers flexibility in financial operations, whereas POLYX emphasizes regulatory adherence. Both bring innovative approaches to the market, making them notable contenders in asset management. Choosing between them depends on specific needs and priorities. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

It has emerged that the company is considering using the eye-scan-based World ID system developed by Tools for Humanity, co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. This is also a system that is linked to the World (WLD) altcoin. The ongoing talks between Reddit and Tools for Humanity could pave the way for users on the platform to both remain anonymous and prove they are human, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The talks have gained momentum amid the rise of fake content generated by artificial intelligence online and the emergence of age-verification laws for social media in several countries. Related News: Two Companies Announce Bitcoin Purchase Strategy - Here's How Much They Plan to Buy Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said last month that due to AI-based threats and age verification regulations, the company will have to determine whether users are human and of a certain age. Huffman said that they will work with third-party providers to avoid collecting user data: “We will work to preserve both the humanity and anonymity of Reddit.” The World ID is created with unique biometric data obtained from a user’s iris. This data is fragmented and stored on secret servers in different parts of the world. The system allows users to prove that they are a unique individual without revealing their identity. The identity verification process is completed with a World ID stored encrypted on the user’s phone. As a reward, users are given WLD tokens. *This is not investment advice.

Avalanche Source: TradingView Avalanche (AVAX) has seen a notable decrease in its price over the past six months, dropping by 54.73%. In the last month, the coin’s value fell by 19.18%, and over the past week, it declined by 16.55%. Currently, AVAX is trading within the range of $17.48 to $21.74, reflecting a consistent downward trend. Technical indicators suggest that this bearish momentum may continue. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 39.86, indicating that the coin is approaching oversold territory but hasn’t reached it yet. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level is at -0.1730, signaling negative momentum. Additionally, the 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages are at $18.02 and $18.91, respectively, both hovering above the current price. If the decline persists, AVAX may test its nearest support level at $15.85. A drop to the second support level at $11.59 would represent a significant decrease from current levels. On the upside, if buying interest emerges, the coin could aim for the nearest resistance level at $24, which would be an increase of over 30%. Breaking past this could see AVAX reaching the second resistance level at $28, but this would require strong positive momentum. Polkadot Source: TradingView Polkadot (DOT) has faced a steep decline over the past six months, losing over 50% of its value. In the last month, it dropped nearly 22%, and over the past week, it fell about 14%. Currently, DOT is trading between $3.54 and $4.23. Technical signals suggest more bearishness ahead. The Relative Strength Index is at 39.93, close to oversold levels. The Stochastic oscillator sits at 15.15, also indicating overselling. The MACD is negative at -0.0330. The 10-day simple moving average is $3.60, below the 100-day average of $3.77, confirming downward momentum. Looking ahead, DOT’s nearest support is at $3.25. A drop below this could see the price falling to the next support at $2.56, a decrease of about 28% from the current low. On the upside, if momentum shifts, DOT could test resistance at $4.63, an increase of roughly 10% from the current high. A continued rise could take it to $5.32, marking a potential gain of about 25%. Conclusion While AVAX and DOT remain strong in the current bull market, XYZVerse’s unique sports memecoin aims for unprecedented growth, uniting fans and potentially outperforming other tokens.

Successively, the valuation of the industry has dropped to $3.2 trillion, with a 1.10% decline in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, the 24-hour trading volume has surged over 42% to hit $114.74 billion, signaling heightened volatility and possibly panic-led sell-offs. Amidst the ruckus, the Fear & Greed Index has moved to 43, placing the market in the neutral zone. Rising tensions in the Middle East and uncertainties around the potential restoration of Trump-era trade policies are spooking both traditional and digital asset investors. Let’s take a closer look at how this is impacting Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction: Can It Hold Above $102k? Bitcoin price today is at $103,491, down 0.94% in the past 24 hours. The daily low sits at $102,372, suggesting that the price is hovering dangerously close to key support levels. The 38% uptick in 24-hour volume to $50.25B indicates aggressive intraday trading, but not necessarily bullish accumulation. If BTC fails to maintain support at $102,000, a further slide toward $100,000 or even $98,500 is highly likely. However, if the market finds temporary relief and BTC reclaims $105,000, a short-term recovery toward $107,000–$108,000 may be on the cards. Curious about BTC’s year-end target? Read our Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030! Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction: $2,400 or $2,300 First? Ethereum is bearing the brunt of today’s drop, plunging 3.59% to $2,423.62. The altcoin has seen its daily trading volume crash by over 76%, now at $21.59 billion. With a daily low of $2,371, ETH is testing a crucial demand zone. If it breaks below $2,370, the next key support lies around $2,300, followed by $2,200. It is worth noting that to initiate a recovery, ETH must climb back above $2,500. That being said, a push beyond $2,570 could invalidate short-term bearish setups and open a route toward $2,650. Hodling ETH? Check out our Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030 Now! XRP Price Prediction: Is a Drop Below $2 Next? XRP price has slipped 1.16% over the past 24 hours to trade at $2.12, with a low of $2.09. Despite the modest drop compared to ETH, the volume has surged 45.9% to $2.49 billion, which I believe, that larger holders are offloading positions. If bearish pressure intensifies, XRP may retest $2.00, a support that could give way to a drop toward $1.90. Contrarily, reclaiming $2.18 could spark a minor relief rally toward $2.30.

Given the sharp volume decline and price weakness, Ethereum could test the $2,300–$2,200 range if the bulls don’t step in soon. Is XRP expected to drop below $2?

His words hold the power to shake the crypto sector, which is why the term “Trump” itself is trending due to his announcements and warnings. This influence is clearly reflected in the price chart of the TRUMP coin. Back in January, the token saw a strong bullish candle, but the momentum didn’t last. In February, Trump’s actions triggered a wave of trade-related fear that impacted many altcoins, which included the token TRUMP as well, despite its direct association with the President. Like many other altcoins, TRUMP retraced and dropped to $7 by early April. Since then, it has attempted three times to reclaim the $16 level. However, in the final week of May, it broke below the dynamic 20-day and 50-day EMA bands, forming a bearish crossover, which is a signal that further downside may follow. If fall continues, then it can revisit $7 lows, but if it resurges, then in the short term, it needs to move above the $11.60 resistance level, so in June or July, it could retest the $16 resistance zone. Looking ahead, if TRUMP can successfully sustain and break above the $16 level in the short term, then it could target $28 by the end of the year. A breakout above this level could open the door for further gains. In terms of its long-term trajectory, the $28 level is considered highly critical in 2025. According to Fibonacci retracement levels and the high volume profile, this zone will likely determine the TRUMP coin’s future direction.

Among them, SUI currently trading at $2.91, has entered a consolidation phase after a volatile start to the year, while Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is attracting growing attention from both retail and early-stage crypto funds. Mutuum Finance is now in Presale Phase 5 at $0.03. Investor interest is still incredibly robust, and over 12,300 investors have bought the token along with a total raise of $10.9 million. Investors who get in on this level will see 100% return on investment when the token is launched at $0.06. Mutuum Finance is quickly earning its spot on lists of the best cheap crypto to buy in 2025, with early forecasts pointing to possible 20x returns if momentum holds. For investors searching for the next crypto to explode, without betting on overbought giants, Mutuum Finance is increasingly being seen as a breakout coin as market sentiment shifts toward undervalued, high-potential projects. Mutuum Finance Exceeds $10.9M Milestone Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about projects in DeFi. With over $10.9 million raised and more than 12,300 investors already on board, the presale is gaining serious momentum. Currently in its fifth phase, the token is priced at $0.03. The next round will see the price jump to $0.035, and with an official launch price of $0.06 already set, early participants could be looking at a 100% return before the token even hits the market. Some analysts are even projecting a post-launch price surge past $2.50 before the 2025 bull run wraps up. Paving the Way for Intelligent, Adaptive DeFi Lending With a lending platform built upon the tenet of user-freedom, control and security, Mutuum Finance is disrupting decentralized finance. Instead of pushing users towards a single model, Mutuum will provide a two-side model which accounts for different manners of DeFi involvements. Its Peer-to-Contract system gives users the option to deposit USDT into automated smart contracts allowing interest rates to fluctuate depending on the activity in the market. This is a passive income source that is hands-off and stable since no manual work is required to execute trades. For users who would like to have more freedom of action have the opportunity of using the Peer-to-Peer option that gives the freedom to the same parties of lending and taking loans to speak directly and make their own conditions and they do not have to depend on third party groups. It is a transparent, trustless model that provides the user complete freedom in their funds, which is an effective option in a more turbulent situation or a specific lending deal. The integration of automation and personalization allows Mutuum Finance to establish a new standard in DeFi lending; the ability to have a fully automated product but not have to completely give up control over the system. Earn Big: $100,000 in Leaderboard and Giveaway Prizes To celebrate its explosive growth and reward early supporters, Mutuum Finance has launched a $100,000 giveaway . Ten winners will each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens, simply for joining early. In addition, the project has rolled out a live leaderboard, where the top 50 MUTM token holders earn exclusive bonus rewards, adding a gamified edge to the presale and making participation even more exciting. Mutuum Finance is rapidly gaining traction as one of the top low-price cryptos to watch, raising over $10.9 million from more than 12,300 early investors, a clear signal of surging demand ahead of Q3. Priced at just $0.03 in Phase 5, the token offers a 100% ROI at launch, with analysts predicting possible 20x gains if momentum continues post-launch.

While Ethereum (ETH) and XRP remain foundational assets, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly gaining recognition as a rising force in the market. With increasing attention on Solana (SOL), Kaspa (KAS), and TRON (TRX), the landscape is shifting toward bold, forward-looking opportunities—where MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a leading contender. MAGACOINFINANCE: The Early-Stage Standout MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as one of the most compelling altcoin plays of the current market cycle. With a capped supply, well-structured rollout, and swift pre-sale sellouts, the project has established itself in a category reserved for high-conviction contenders. Its accelerating traction among both retail and institutional investors underscores a unique market position—drawing early comparisons to the foundational phases of today’s most established digital assets. For forward-looking investors, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly viewed as a strategic choice heading into 2025. Ethereum (ETH): Institutional Growth and DeFi Leadership Ethereum remains a pillar of high-growth portfolios, with analysts projecting a price of up to $6,700 by year-end. The network’s adoption by major institutions, ongoing Layer-2 upgrades, and the recent Pectra update are strengthening ETH’s competitive edge. As DeFi and tokenization continue to expand, ETH’s long-term outlook remains robust. XRP: Volatility and Bullish Catalysts XRP is trading near $0.54, with analysts projecting a range of $2.20 to $8 for 2025, depending on the outcome of the Ripple lawsuit and potential ETF approvals. Whale transactions and institutional engagement are on the rise, and many traders are looking to MAGACOIN FINANCE for even sharper upside as XRP’s volatility persists. Solana (SOL): Bullish Momentum and Retail Growth Solana is trading between $150 and $195, with bullish forecasts for a breakout to $210 or higher this summer. Record wallet growth and ecosystem expansion are fueling optimism, and as SOL consolidates, many investors are rotating into MAGACOIN FINANCE for early-stage gains. Kaspa (KAS): Steady but Moderate Gains Kaspa is forecasted to trade between $0.078 and $0.081 through the summer, with analysts expecting steady but moderate returns. As KAS’s growth stabilizes, investors seeking higher multiples are increasingly allocating to MAGACOIN FINANCE. TRON (TRX): Uptrend and Price Targets TRON is holding above $0.28, with June forecasts targeting $0.31 and a bullish outlook for 2025. As TRX’s uptrend continues, some traders are diversifying into MAGACOIN FINANCE to capture fresh early-stage upside. Final Thoughts With ETH, XRP, and MAGACOIN FINANCE all leading the charge, 2025 is shaping up to be a pivotal year for high-growth crypto portfolios. As SOL, KAS, and TRX hold steady, the boldest opportunities may belong to those who move early on MAGACOIN FINANCE.

The visionary billionaire behind Tesla and SpaceX is now transforming X —formerly Twitter—into a decentralized finance powerhouse. If successful, Musk could deliver the Western version of WeChat, combining social media, investing, payments, and crypto all in one app. X to Launch Its Own Decentralized Exchange (DEX) According to a recent post on X by crypto researcher Atlas , the platform is quietly developing into a full-fledged financial ecosystem. Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, confirmed that in-app investing, tipping, and payments are already in the pipeline. These features will be part of X Money , a new digital finance platform currently in limited beta testing, with a broader rollout expected in 2025. One major highlight? Visa is now an official partner of X’s upcoming DEX. Why Musk’s Super App Vision Could Be a Game-Changer Musk’s ultimate goal is to replicate WeChat’s super app model—but in the West. WeChat dominates in China by combining messaging, payments, e-commerce, and even government services into one platform. By integrating a decentralized exchange, Musk gives users: Full control over their funds Censorship resistance Lower transaction fees Enhanced financial privacy Other tech giants are taking note: Meta is exploring in-app payments TikTok is pushing into e-commerce Telegram has already launched P2P crypto trading and tipping But X’s existing scale and Musk’s crypto-friendly stance could give it a major first-mover advantage. Could X Disrupt Coinbase, Robinhood, and Revolut? Atlas warns that this move could shake up the entire fintech and crypto exchange landscape. With in-app trading of stablecoins , BTC, ETH, and tokenized assets, X could replace the need for separate apps like Coinbase, Robinhood, and Revolut. While centralized exchanges like Binance, Bybit, Coinbase, OKX, and Upbit still handle more than 85% of crypto spot volume, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are rapidly growing. Top DEXs by volume today include: PancakeSwap (v2 & v3) Uniswap v2 Raydium Curve Finance The Future of Finance Will Be Cultural, Not Technical Atlas emphasizes that mass adoption won’t come from whitepapers or technical jargon—it will come from entertainment, virality, and seamless finance integration. With X already a cultural hub, Musk may be the one to trigger the next wave of crypto adoption —not with a whitepaper, but with a viral tweet. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Price has been trading within a tightening symmetrical triangle for several weeks, and now, attention has turned to the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which shows a significant breakdown below a key trendline. Crypto analyst CasiTrades (@CasiTrades), who has been tracking this setup, highlights the importance of the RSI’s breakdown, calling it a clear signal that pressure is building. At the time of her analysis, XRP traded at $2.14. Meanwhile, momentum indicators, particularly the daily RSI, have formed a descending triangle, which has now broken to the downside. This move in the RSI often precedes corresponding price action, making it a critical leading indicator. XRP On The Edge Of Breakout! The daily RSI trendline, which has been one of the clearest tools tracking this apex, is now breaking down. This leading indicator says a lot. Price has stalled. Volatility dried up. And now the pressure is building toward a release. That… pic.twitter.com/2hEN4VWN2n — CasiTrades (@CasiTrades) June 20, 2025 Can XRP Hold Above Crucial Support Levels? According to CasiTrades, this setup is part of a broader price structure designed to build energy for a larger breakout. She has been tracking XRP’s movements for a long time and recently revealed that the asset is due for a decisive move with no time left. However, the immediate outlook suggests that it is likely to first test lower support zones before any meaningful reversal. She recently revealed that the support at $2.25 has flipped to resistance , and the levels holding the asset up include $2.01, $1.90, and $1.55 in the event of an extended downturn. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The chart also shows Fibonacci retracement levels aligned with these areas, particularly the 1.236 extension at $2.01 and the 0.786 retracement at $1.83, which adds technical weight to their significance. CasiTrades believes that these supports will remain in play until the digital asset breaks above the $3 level . The End of the Consolidation Structure The triangular formation drawn on the chart is a classical technical pattern, suggesting that XRP is in the final stages of its consolidation. Based on current indicators, the bias is tilting slightly to the downside, not as a sign of trend reversal, but as a mechanism for testing liquidity and market response at support zones before a potential upward move. CasiTrades emphasizes that this move should not be interpreted as a weakness. Instead, she sees it as a means to gather energy for the breakout, predicting a sharp flush and a swift V-shaped recovery if the asset hits any support level cleanly. If that type of reversal occurs, it could signal the end of the consolidation phase and kickstart a run toward new highs.

But while Cardano continues to expand its ecosystem, Ruvi AI (RUVI) has emerged as a competitive force that analysts are tipping to reach $1 per token first. With over $1.9 million raised in its presale and a growing buzz among investors, Ruvi AI is uniting blockchain technology with artificial intelligence (AI) to deliver real-world solutions. Its rapid growth and structured roadmap have set an exciting pace that Cardano might find hard to match. Could Ruvi AI Beat Cardano to $1? Cardano’s adoption has been steady but gradual, tied heavily to its development timelines. Ruvi AI, on the other hand, is making quicker gains by addressing immediate needs in marketing , entertainment , and finance . Its utility-driven approach has broad applications, ensuring sustained demand for its tokens, as businesses and industries turn to its AI-powered blockchain platform to solve their challenges. The structured growth model of Ruvi AI separates it from many speculative cryptocurrencies. Its current pricing during Phase 2 of its presale is just $0.015 per token , creating a rare opportunity for early investors. Once the presale ends, token prices will rise to $0.07 , offering an almost 5x ROI even before hitting exchanges. Predictions of a $1 token price post-listing translate to a massive 66x ROI from its current price. This clear roadmap gives Ruvi AI a faster trajectory for reaching $1 than what Cardano has demonstrated. Presale Success and Momentum Ruvi AI’s ongoing presale has already set a high standard among AI-token projects, achieving milestones that underline its growing potential. $1.9 million+ raised 160 million tokens sold 1,600+ holders onboarded One of the most reassuring aspects of Ruvi AI’s presale is its guaranteed $0.07 token price post-presale , which underscores stability and transparency for investors. This pricing approach not only boosts confidence but also sets clear expectations for growth, unlike Cardano’s valuation, which is often tied to broader market sentiment. VIP Tiers Multiply Investor Opportunities For those eager to maximize returns, Ruvi AI’s VIP investment tiers offer attractive bonuses that complement its presale opportunities. Here’s how they work: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These tiers are tailored for early backers who want to lock in exponential gains with minimal risks, ensuring a level of profitability rarely offered in presale projects. Built on Trust and Transparency While Cardano has garnered respect for its thorough and peer-reviewed approach, Ruvi AI is building investor confidence through its strong focus on transparency and security. The platform is undergoing a third-party CyberScope audit , confirming the reliability of its underlying blockchain infrastructure. Additionally, Ruvi AI has partnered with WEEX Exchange , ensuring smooth post-presale liquidity . This partnership will allow RUVI token holders to trade seamlessly upon listing, alleviating concerns over accessibility and liquidity. Real-World Utility Drives Long-Term Value Unlike projects that rely heavily on speculation, Ruvi AI brings real-world utility that ensures lasting demand for its tokens. Analysts emphasize the platform’s broad applicability across critical industries: Marketing: Ruvi AI’s AI-driven tools help businesses improve ad targeting and optimize campaign performance, ensuring stronger ROIs. Entertainment: The platform supports content creators with personalized AI recommendations and blockchain-secured payments, empowering them to monetize effectively. Finance: Financial institutions leverage Ruvi AI to improve fraud detection, provide operational transparency, and scale their capabilities efficiently. It’s this expansive reach that not only guarantees Ruvi AI a competitive edge but also reinforces its value as a long-term investment. The Road Ahead for Ruvi AI While Cardano continues its steady climb, Ruvi AI has emerged as a standout contender by combining innovation, transparency, and rapid returns. Its $0.015 presale price , locked post-presale $0.07 valuation , and projected $1 token price make it a unique investment opportunity. With more than $1.9 million raised , 160 million tokens sold , and strong partnerships with CyberScope and WEEX Exchange , Ruvi AI is paving the way for fast-tracked exponential growth. If you’re looking for the next major cryptocurrency to skyrocket, Ruvi AI stands as a premier choice.

Developers are stuck, buyers are missing, and the population is falling off a cliff. The country’s real estate mess didn’t start this year. It’s been spiraling since late 2020, and now the final nail is demographic: fewer people are alive to buy homes. That means more empty apartments, fewer home sales, and a property sector bleeding out with no real solution. The numbers are brutal. Goldman Sachs said this week that China’s new home demand in urban areas is stuck at under 5 million units per year, down from 20 million in 2017. The problem is simple. There are fewer people being born, more people dying, and no growth left in the cities. “Falling population and slowing urbanization suggest decreasing demographic demand for housing,” the bank’s economists wrote in their Monday note, as reported by CNBC. Fewer babies, fewer buyers, fewer homes sold The World Bank now expects China’s population to shrink below 1.39 billion by 2035, compared to 1.41 billion today. Tianchen Xu, senior economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said the drop is because of fewer births and more deaths tied to an aging population. Goldman Sachs added that this will knock down home demand by half a million units every year this decade, and that hit gets steeper in the 2030s—1.4 million fewer homes sold each year. In the 2010s, population growth added 1.5 million units to demand every year. That’s completely flipped now. The country tried to fix it. In 2016, Beijing ended the one-child policy. They also pushed cash incentives to get people to have more kids. None of it worked. Fertility rates kept falling. Xu said these policies have “limited effect” because they don’t fix real-life problems like poor income, unstable jobs, and the high cost of having children. He also said many younger people are delaying marriage, choosing careers instead, or just not interested in starting families at all. And the collapse is visible in schools. Over the past two years, nearly 36,000 kindergartens shut down across China , based on data from the Ministry of Education. More than 10 million preschool students vanished from the system. The number of elementary schools dropped by almost 13,000 between 2022 and 2024, which is erasing the education-based housing demand that once drove prices up in key neighborhoods. People used to pay premiums to live near top schools. Now those premiums are evaporating. William Wu, property analyst at Daiwa Capital Markets, said fewer kids and changing enrollment rules mean those homes don’t hold the same value. Local governments are also scaling back district-based school access, which used to drive up prices. One mother in Beijing reportedly told CNBC she bought her apartment two years ago for double the average price in the city. She did it so her 7-year-old son could get into a good public school. But now the unit is worth 20% less. That timeline matches up with Wind Information’s data showing that first-grade enrollment in 2023 was the highest in two decades—right before it crashed again in 2024, the year her son started school. Prices fall harder as no one buys The property market hasn’t recovered from the crash that started in late 2020. Government action—both national and local—has done little to slow it down. Since last September, a series of measures rolled out, but they barely made a dent. New home prices dropped in May at the fastest pace in seven months, Macquarie’s chief China economist Larry Hu said. It’s been two straight years of price decline. Sales are falling just as fast. In the first half of this month, new home sales across 30 major China cities dropped 11% year-on-year. That’s worse than the 3% drop in May. Hu added that even though the government is trying to support the market , none of it is stopping the bleeding. Goldman expects the rise in urban living to slow in the next few years. That kills off what’s left of the growth story. Wu agreed. He said the real impact of China’s demographic crash on property won’t hit all at once. It’ll take decades. Still, he pointed out that “some of this decline will be offset by continued urbanization, and housing upgrade demand.” But right now, those upgrades aren’t coming in fast enough.

According to their June 21 research note, the question is no longer “if,” but “when.” The momentum behind crypto ETFs has surged since Bitcoin and Ethereum funds made their debut on Wall Street. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust alone gathered over $70 billion in assets under management, faster than any ETF in history. NEW: @EricBalchunas & I are raising our odds for the vast majority of the spot crypto ETF filings to 90% or higher. Engagement from the SEC is a very positive sign in our opinion pic.twitter.com/5dh8G8rK6Y — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) June 20, 2025 With crypto legitimacy rising in D.C., the SEC has shown a willingness to engage with altcoin ETF filings, including updated S-1 forms from Fidelity, Grayscale, Bitwise, and VanEck. Solana is seen as a frontrunner due to its market depth, developer traction, and now, staking-enabled ETF proposals. If approved, these ETFs wouldn’t just track SOL, they’d also stake held tokens, generating additional yield for investors. What a Solana ETF Could Mean for Price Institutional investors gaining direct access to Solana could dramatically shift market dynamics. According to Brian Rudick, Chief Strategy Officer at Solana-focused Upexi, top-tier altcoin ETFs, such as SOL, are likely to see strong inflows post-launch, similar to Bitcoin’s explosive run after its ETF debut. “Spot ETFs were the main reason Bitcoin more than doubled after BlackRock filed in mid-2023,” Rudick said. A comparable demand shock for Solana could ignite a similar rally. If history repeats itself, ETF-driven inflows could propel SOL toward the $200 mark, especially if market sentiment and macroeconomic tailwinds align. Analysts also point to the CFTC’s futures approval for SOL as another positive signal, which reinforces market maturity and regulatory openness toward the asset. Price Faces Technical Hurdles Before Breakout Despite ETF optimism, Solana’s short-term technicals remain bearish. At $140.40, SOL is struggling below the key resistance zone between $144.49 and $145.49, aligned with a descending trendline and the 50-period EMA. SOL is stuck below key resistance at $144.49–$145.49, with a bearish engulfing candle and MACD in the red. If $138.39 support breaks, eyes on $135.74 and $132.57 next. #Solana #Crypto #SOL #TechnicalAnalysis pic.twitter.com/UTWYK9JnOA — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) June 21, 2025 A bearish engulfing candle followed the last failed breakout attempt, sending the token into a consolidation phase just above support at $138.39. The MACD indicator remains in bearish territory, suggesting continued downside risk unless SOL reclaims the $145 zone. Should support at $138.39 give way, price could drop toward $135.74 or even $132.57. Solana Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Key Takeaways: Bloomberg pegs SOL ETF approval odds at 95% ETF issuers include Grayscale, Fidelity, VanEck Staking-enabled ETFs could boost investor yield SOL must break $145.49 to regain bullish momentum Downside levels to watch: $138.39, $135.74, $132.57 Outlook: ETF approval is a long-term catalyst ; however, for short-term Solana price prediction , traders should watch for a confirmed breakout above $145 to signal a bullish continuation. BTC Bull Token Nears $8.2M Cap as 58% APY Staking Attracts Last-Minute Buyers In addition to Solana, with BTC trading near $104K, investor focus is shifting toward altcoins, especially BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The project has now raised $7,249,360 out of its $8,290,897 cap, leaving less than $1 million before the next token price hike. The current price of $0.00257 is expected to increase once the cap is hit. BTC Bull Token links its value directly to Bitcoin through two core mechanisms: BTC Airdrops reward holders, with presale participants receiving priority. Supply Burns occur automatically every time BTC increases by $50,000, reducing $BTCBULL’s circulating supply. The token also features a 58% APY staking pool holding over 1.81 billion tokens, offering: No lockups or fees Full liquidity Stable passive yields, even in volatile markets This staking model appeals to both DeFi veterans and newcomers seeking hands-off income. With just hours left and the hard cap nearly reached, momentum is building fast. BTCBULL ’s blend of Bitcoin-linked value, scarcity mechanics, and flexible staking is fueling strong demand. Early buyers have a limited time to enter before the next pricing tier activates.

46462567,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=171040,1750492255,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/46462567.jpeg,Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong: Why the World Desperately Needs Crypto Now,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/coinbase-ceo-crypto-need/,"BitcoinWorld Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong: Why the World Desperately Needs Crypto Now In a recent and impactful statement, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong took to social media to share a powerful message resonating with many in the digital asset space: the World needs crypto , perhaps now more than at any point in recent history. This isn’t just a bold claim from a figurehead in the industry; it’s a perspective rooted in observing significant global economic trends that he believes cryptocurrency is uniquely positioned to address. Why Does Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong Believe Crypto is Essential? Brian Armstrong’s assertion stems from several critical global economic challenges. He specifically highlighted three major concerns driving his conviction: Exponentially Growing Debt Levels: Across nations, both public and private debt continues to balloon. This unsustainable growth raises questions about future economic stability and the potential for currency devaluation as governments potentially resort to printing more money to service debt. Widespread Inflation: Many countries are grappling with persistent inflation, eroding purchasing power and making it harder for individuals and families to save and maintain their standard of living. Traditional financial systems often struggle to contain this, leaving citizens vulnerable. Erosion of Economic Freedom: Armstrong argues that economic freedom is being chipped away globally. This can manifest in various ways, from capital controls and censorship of transactions to limited access to financial services for large portions of the world’s population. According to the Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong , these intertwined issues create a pressing need for alternative financial systems that are more resilient, accessible, and permissionless than traditional finance. He sees crypto as that necessary alternative. Exploring the Core Crypto Benefits Armstrong Highlights When we talk about why the World needs crypto , we’re really talking about the fundamental advantages that cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology offer in the face of the challenges Armstrong outlined. The crypto benefits that stand out include: Decentralization: Unlike traditional currencies controlled by central banks, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin operate on decentralized networks. This removes single points of control and potential failure, offering a degree of independence from government fiscal policies that can lead to inflation or debt crises. Permissionless Access: Anyone with an internet connection can access and use cryptocurrencies. This is a massive step towards global financial inclusion, particularly for the estimated 1.7 billion adults worldwide who remain unbanked but may have mobile phones. This directly combats the erosion of economic freedom by providing financial tools to everyone. Transparency and Security: Transactions on public blockchains are transparent (though parties can be pseudonymous) and secured by cryptographic principles. This contrasts with opaque traditional financial systems and offers a level of security against censorship or arbitrary seizure. Potential Hedge Against Inflation: While volatile, some cryptocurrencies, particularly those with capped supplies like Bitcoin, are viewed by proponents as a potential store of value and a hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies caused by inflation and excessive money printing. Understanding crypto and inflation dynamics is crucial for many seeking alternatives to traditional savings methods. These inherent features form the bedrock of Armstrong’s argument that crypto is not just a speculative asset class, but a vital tool for navigating the current global economic landscape. How Does Crypto Offer Economic Freedom Crypto? The concept of Economic freedom crypto is central to Brian Armstrong’s vision. What does this truly mean in practice? It means giving individuals greater autonomy over their finances. Consider a few scenarios: An individual in a country experiencing hyperinflation can hold value in a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin or a stablecoin, preserving their wealth better than holding the rapidly devaluing local currency. A freelancer working for international clients can receive payments quickly and cheaply using crypto, bypassing slow and expensive traditional cross-border transfer systems that often involve multiple intermediaries and fees. People living under authoritarian regimes or in areas with underdeveloped banking infrastructure can access financial services, store value, and transact without needing permission from a bank or government entity. This ability to transact, save, and invest without intermediaries or geographic limitations is the essence of the Economic freedom crypto promises. It empowers individuals and reduces reliance on potentially unstable or restrictive traditional financial systems. Addressing Crypto and Inflation Concerns One of the most discussed aspects of why the World needs crypto , according to Armstrong, is its role in combating inflation. The relationship between Crypto and inflation is complex, but the core idea is that assets with limited supply, like Bitcoin (capped at 21 million coins), are inherently deflationary or disinflationary by design, contrasting sharply with fiat currencies which can be printed indefinitely by central banks. While the crypto market is known for its volatility, many investors see assets like Bitcoin as a form of ‘digital gold’ – a store of value that holds its purchasing power over the long term, especially as traditional currencies lose value due to inflationary pressures. This perspective is gaining traction as global inflation persists. What Does This Mean for the Average Person? Brian Armstrong’s message isn’t just for economists or crypto enthusiasts. It has implications for everyone. As global debt rises and inflation eats away at savings, understanding alternatives becomes increasingly important. The crypto benefits discussed aren’t just theoretical; they offer practical ways for individuals to protect their wealth, participate in the global economy, and gain a degree of financial independence. Whether it’s exploring cryptocurrencies as a small part of a diversified savings strategy or using crypto for faster, cheaper international remittances, the opportunities presented by this technology are becoming harder to ignore in the current economic climate. Conclusion: Crypto’s Growing Role in a Challenging World Brian Armstrong’s statement serves as a potent reminder of the foundational problems that cryptocurrency was created to address. In a world grappling with mounting debt, persistent inflation, and concerns about economic freedom, the case for why the World needs crypto becomes compelling. The unique features of decentralization, permissionless access, and transparency offer tangible crypto benefits that can empower individuals and provide alternatives to traditional financial systems facing significant stress.

Consider These 2 Shiba Inu (SHIB) Killers Below $0.01,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/consider-these-2-shiba-inu-shib-killers-below-0-01/,"The post Want to Get Rich with Just $100? Consider These 2 Shiba Inu (SHIB) Killers Below $0.01 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Meme-coin crazes pop up every few months, and hopeful traders keep trying to turn pocket change into life-changing cash. Right now, that $100 buy-in looks eye-catching on Little Pepe (LILPEPE) and Bonk (BONK), two tokens buzzing with breakout chatter. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Meme Coin With Infrastructure Ambition Stage 2 Presale Details Current price: $0.0011 per $LILPEPE $1,138,724 raised out of a target of $1.325 million Over 1.08 billion tokens sold Launch price set for $0.003, offering a ~172.7% upside immediately post-listing Many meme coins blow up on nothing but excitement and posts that fade by lunchtime. Little Pepe, though, is nailing down real tech by launching its own Layer 2 chain, one that settles blocks almost on the fly, charges zero trading tax, slams bot abuse, and hands creators a complete toolbox. In other words, LILPEPE packs a mission, not just a mascot. Why Early Buyers Should be Hyped: The price is currently $0.0011, and chatter already hints at a listing near $0.003. That jump adds a little slippage, and early wallets could see their stack triple before most folks even notice. Stage 1 snagged more than $300,000 in fresh cash in the first two days. Quick money means developers can crank code instead of begging for patience. The team carved out $777,000 in tokens for a giveaway to create awareness about the launch and reward its community. Ten winners will snag $77,000 each, and the buzz around that prize is leaking into feeds from Reddit to TikTok. Fold these pieces together and you get a classic meme-stage recipe: low price, clear listing target, loud community, and a product that works instead of winks. It’s the same cocktail that sent SHIB and PEPE to wild heights, but, for once, someone wrote a playbook first. Bonk (BONK): Solana’s Meme Veteran Primed for Next Chapter On-Chain Snapshot Price: $0.000014(~$1 billion market cap) Despite a 14% weekly dip, BONK is rebounding fast, up 3.9% recently. Why It Still Matters Tight supply: TONDAO just torched a jaw-dropping 1.69 trillion tokens. With so many coins off the ledger, scarcity- and value-growth- are in play. Big-money buzz: Fund managers are eyeing a 2x-leverage Bonk ETF. When Wall Street talks, it can shake more than a few piggy banks. Green charts: MACD, RSI, and those falling-wedge breakouts are lighting up like a holiday tree. Traders love seeing that kind of signal. Riding Solana’s wave: What happens to Solana often pulls Bonk along for the ride. Ecosystems like that don’t grow in fits-they lift everything onboard. BONK definitely isn’t drifting without a plan—the token rides on raw momentum, solid trading rules, and the sheer power of its community. Should analysts guess right and Solana bounces back, Bonk would tag along for a big payday. Side-by-Side Comparison Feature Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Bonk (BONK) Presale/Current Price $0.0011 (Stage 2) $0.000014 Market Cap Presale stage ~$1billion Key Differentiator Proprietary L2 chain, no-tax model Largest Solana meme coin, burning tokens Upside Potential Target listing at $0.003 (≈3× gain) Analysts project +22–77% short-term Risk Profile Very low(presale stage) High (established but volatile) Conclusion: Fresh Bets, Big Potential Little Pepe keeps popping up in chats that feel, well, a tad different. You drop a hundred bucks now and score the presale price, possibly locking in tens of thousands of tokens. Folks are already daydreaming about 2x or 3x when it hits a public exchange. What grabs attention is the chain itself: a Layer 2 playground built for meme coins that promises lightning-fast trades, swaps without the tax bite, and space for later meme launches. The roadmap reads like an inside joke gone public, starting with Pregnancy and finishing who knows where with Dominance. Toss in a hard cap on tokens and a plan for the crowd to steer the ship, and you’ve got a classic high-risk, high-reward setup that some investors can’t resist. Bonk feels more like old news that keeps surprising you. It’s been Solana’s poster-child meme coin for long enough to rack up a big following and score real-world deals, from betting apps to wallets you use every day. Traders watch the charts and whisper that a fresh bull market could throw its price into the 5x-or-maybe-10x zone. Add landing spots on giants like Binance and Coinbase, and Bonk trades the sketchy label for at least a little bit of credibility. Volatile still? Absolutely. Worth holding in case? Many think so. In conclusion, these tokens are great bets, but Bonk pales in comparison to Little Pepe in terms of their potential to transform $100 into a life-changing sum.

Altcoins to Drop 50–80%, Bitcoin to Face 45% Crash",https://coinpedia.org/news/crypto-crash-coming-altcoins-to-drop-50-80-bitcoin-to-face-45-crash/,"The post Crypto Crash Coming! Altcoins to Drop 50–80%, Bitcoin to Face 45% Crash appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is down 3% today, bringing the total market cap to $3 trillion. Bitcoin has dropped to $103,000, down 1.1%. Major altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, and XRP are also down by up to 3%, while memecoins such as Dogecoin, Litecoin, and others continue to slide. Top analyst Crypto Capo had recently issued a strong warning saying, “We haven’t seen anything yet.” He warns that altcoins are already dropping hard, even though Bitcoin is still above $100K. Altcoins Could Drop 50–70%, Memecoins To Face 80% Wipeout He identifies two key support levels for Bitcoin: first at $93,000 and then the main support zone between $60K and $ 70 K. This would be a 35-45% decline from the current prices. In a full-blown capitulation or a Black Swan scenario, the analyst says Ethereum could drop 45-55% and reach the $1000-$1200 range. Altcoins are expected to drop 50-70% on average, while memecoins could be hit the hardest. They could crash by up to 60-80%, as per the analyst. He expects the real drop to begin once Bitcoin breaks the $100,000 level. That is when bearish momentum could accelerate sharply. He also shared a few examples of coins that are already collapsing before Bitcoin’s drawdown. Charts Point to Memecoin Meltdown Crypto Capo’s charts show memecoins are on the edge of major breakdowns. FARTCOIN is at risk of dropping 61% to the first support zone around $0.38, and possibly 82% drop to $0.17 if it falls further. RETARDIO is stuck below resistance and showing weakness. Despite several bounces, it’s stuck in a lower range, showing signs of exhaustion. PEPE has triggered a bearish Head and Shoulders pattern, with an expected 70% drop ahead. Slow Bleed Continues CryptoQuant data also shows that altcoins are still deep in a slump. Altcoin Sherpa notes that the top gainers like Fartcoin, SPX, and $HYPE are pulling back the hardest, while the rest of the market is in a slow, steady bleed. He also expects coins like POPCAT to continue drifting lower, with no major liquidations or panic selling so far. Most altcoins look weak, and the analyst sees no strong buy signals at the moment.

This product is the world’s second spot XRP ETF, following Brazil’s Hashdex offering. Notably, the Purpose XRP ETF closed 1.63% lower at $9.68 on Friday, June 20, 2024, extending its post-launch decline as light trading kept it near its session low. Purpose XRP spot ETF chart. Source: TradingView Since its launch, the new fund, also available in CAD-hedged (XRPP) and CAD non-hedged (XRPP.B) versions, has mostly trended lower, reflecting XRP’s overall market performance. This aligns with the performance of the Brazilian ETF, which has fallen about 7.50% since its debut, partly due to weaknesses in the underlying XRP token. Purpose’s new ETFs have a management fee of 0.69%, capped at 0.89%, with any savings passed on to investors. For Canadians, the funds can also be held in tax-friendly accounts like TFSAs and RRSPs, giving investors easy crypto exposure within traditional portfolios. These new products have had little effect on XRP’s price so far, likely because Canada and Brazil have much smaller financial markets than the United States. Looking ahead, U.S. regulators are paying more attention to launching their spot XRP ETFs, with several applications under consideration. To this end, the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) recently invited public comments on Franklin Templeton’s and WisdomTree XRP Trust’s proposed XRP and Solana ETFs. If approved, these ETFs would trade on Cboe’s BZX Exchange. XRP price analysis Meanwhile, both existing XRP ETFs continue to trade in sync with XRP, which is under bearish pressure. At press time, the asset was valued at $2.13, down nearly 1%, and over the past week, it has lost about 1.7%. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold From a technical perspective, XRP is trading below its 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) of $2.30. This shows short-term weakness and sustained downward pressure. However, it is still well above its 200-day SMA of $1.85, indicating that its long-term uptrend remains intact and the broader outlook is still positive. Additionally, the 14-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) is at 45.07, a neutral level that suggests XRP is neither overbought nor oversold.

Ethereum, MAGACOIN FINANCE, and Solana are increasingly seen as three projects that could lead the next wave of wealth-building opportunities in crypto. With their structures, adoption trends, and technical alignment, these assets may be the ones to watch as the cycle matures. Ethereum (ETH) Holds Institutional Confidence Ethereum continues to trade between $2,500 and $2,600, wrestling with resistance near $2,600 and support at $2,440. Institutional activity remains high: Nasdaq-listed SharpLink Gaming recently acquired over $460 million worth of ETH and staked 95% of it, making it the largest public ETH holder. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s futures open interest has hit record highs, signaling that traders expect significant movement in the coming weeks. The May 2025 Pectra upgrade also boosted validator performance, while ongoing spot ETF momentum continues to attract institutional inflows. If ETH breaks $2,600 with strength, forecasts suggest a run toward $2,800–$3,300 — and possibly higher in a broader market rally. Solana (SOL) Rises on Ecosystem Strength Solana has solidified its role as one of the most active Layer 1 ecosystems. With daily active users and developer contributions climbing, Solana maintains a lead in network utility and efficiency. Even without explosive price movement this cycle, traders remain highly engaged thanks to its speed, low fees, and widespread dApp deployment. Its strength lies in real-world usage and persistent network growth. As sentiment shifts toward fundamentals, Solana continues to earn serious consideration as one of the most promising large-cap performers of the year. MAGACOIN FINANCE: From Underdog to Strategic Power Play While Ethereum and Solana dominate the headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is winning over investors behind the scenes — and not by accident. Early-stage traders and even some Bitcoin whales are quietly accumulating the token for what they view as a rare alignment of opportunity and structure. With a fixed supply of 170 billion tokens, the project has created scarcity from day one — a key factor in sustaining long-term value. The ability to stake tokens and earn passive rewards adds real-time utility to early ownership, drawing in holders who are thinking about yield, not just speculation. But what’s setting MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is behavior. On-chain metrics show wallet consolidation, consistent staking activity, and virtually no signs of pump-and-dump turnover. The technical foundation is also solid, with a fully audited smart contract by HashEx, and zero VC oversight — the entire project is community-driven. A limited-time early entry bonus (PATRIOTS100X) is further accelerating accumulation, giving investors one last advantage before listings reshape the pricing structure. This isn’t about hype — it’s about strategy, positioning, and long-view conviction. Final Thoughts While Ethereum and Solana continue to lead in adoption and performance, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the under-the-radar altcoin that could surprise everyone in 2025. Each of these projects offers a unique wealth-building blueprint — and for those paying attention now, the window to get ahead is still open.

Some analysts believe that a breakout toward the $700 barrier might occur next, which could lead to a bigger move to new highs. Related Reading: Solana Correction About To End? Analyst Forecasts $130 Retest Before Next Wave Up BNB Breakout To Retest $700 On Friday, BNB dropped to the $640 support after failing to hold the mid-zone of its local price range. The cryptocurrency has been trading within the $630-$690 price range following its reclaim of the $600 barrier last month. During the May breakout, BNB neared the crucial $700 resistance level, hitting a four-month high of $697. This key level propelled the altcoin’s price toward its $788 all-time high (ATH) after being broken in late 2024 and was lost during the early 2025 pullbacks. Now, the cryptocurrency is eyeing a reclaim of this area as support to continue its price recovery. Analyst Carl Runefelt from The Moon Show noted that BNB displays a one-month descending triangle pattern on the daily timeframe, with price compressing between the support and resistance levels. According to the chart, the formation’s support sits around the $635 level, while the descending resistance sits around the $650 area. To Runefelt, a bullish breakout from this pattern could propel the token 10% toward the $700 resistance. Notably, reclaiming and confirming this key area as support could also send BNB’s price toward another crucial horizontal level. Analyst Crypto Batman recently highlighted that BNB is forming a multi-month ascending triangle, “holding strong” near the ascending trendline after continuing to bounce from the $635-$640 support zone. To the market watcher, “Even with market uncertainty, BNB structure is clean after respecting the trendline and bouncing off major support, now eyeing a breakout above $700,” which could be part of a bigger move toward the $800 level. Is A Move To $800 Coming? Crypto Batman also noted that the cryptocurrency could be following the same price action as last year. He asserted that the altcoin’s price “loves testing key zones before liftoff,” adding that it is displaying the same base form as it did in Q3 2024. Last year, the token formed a three-month base around the $460-$470 area, which led to an “explosive” run over the next few months. This year, BNB formed a similar base near the $550 level, and it’s “showing strength again.” To the analyst, “If the pattern repeats, then patience will give us profits.” Additionally, he pointed out that despite the early April retraces, BNB held its macro range, trading above the range lows and multi-time-tested support. Related Reading: SUI Preparing For New Highs As Falling Wedge Breakout Targets $5 The cryptocurrency is now consolidating near the mid-zone, which could propel the price to a retest of the macro range highs around the $729 mark. He explained that “If we see a breakout above the $729 resistance, it could open the path toward a 50% move to the upside.” The analyst affirmed that BNB’s structure remains bullish as long as the cryptocurrency holds the $490-$500 levels, adding that the $600 mark is also a strong support. As of this writing, BNB is trading at $641, a 2.9% decline in the weekly timeframe.

For those following the intersection of big tech ambition and disruptive innovation, particularly relevant to the crypto space which often leverages cutting-edge AI, recent reports indicate Meta AI is making bold moves not just in technology development, but in securing top-tier human capital. The Bold Bid for Safe Superintelligence Recent reports shed light on Meta’s strategy to accelerate its AI capabilities. According to sources, Meta made a substantial attempt to acquire Safe Superintelligence, the AI startup co-founded by Ilya Sutskever, formerly the chief scientist at OpenAI. This move underscores the intense competition among tech leaders to gain an edge in the AI race. Safe Superintelligence, valued at a reported $32 billion, represents a significant player in the burgeoning AI landscape, focusing on building safe superintelligence. The valuation itself speaks volumes about the perceived potential and importance of the company’s mission and the expertise of its founders, including Sutskever, who played a pivotal role in some of the most significant AI advancements in recent years. However, the acquisition attempt was reportedly unsuccessful. Sutskever and his co-founders ultimately declined Meta’s offer. This rejection highlights the independent vision and perhaps the desire of the Safe Superintelligence team to pursue their goals autonomously, rather than integrating into a larger corporate structure like Meta. Shifting Focus to Daniel Gross Following the unsuccessful acquisition attempt, Meta’s focus appears to have shifted towards individuals rather than the entire entity. Reports now indicate that Meta is in discussions to hire Daniel Gross, a co-founder and the CEO of Safe Superintelligence. This strategic pivot suggests that while the full acquisition was not feasible, Meta remains keen on bringing key leadership and expertise from the startup into its fold. Daniel Gross is a respected figure in the tech and venture capital world, known for his sharp insights and ability to identify and nurture promising technologies and talent. His potential recruitment signals Meta’s determination to integrate high-caliber leadership into its AI division. Securing talent like Gross could provide Meta with invaluable experience in leading and scaling AI research and development efforts. His background, which includes significant experience in the startup ecosystem and venture investing, could bring a unique perspective to Meta’s large-scale AI projects. This move aligns with Mark Zuckerberg’s stated goal of building world-leading AI capabilities. Meta’s Aggressive AI Talent Acquisition Strategy The pursuit of Daniel Gross is not an isolated incident but part of a broader, aggressive AI talent hiring spree by Meta. The company has been actively recruiting prominent figures from across the AI and tech landscape. Earlier reports indicated that Meta was also in talks to hire Nat Friedman, the former CEO of GitHub, alongside Gross. Friedman’s experience leading a major tech platform and his involvement in the AI investment space make him another highly sought-after individual. Furthermore, Meta is reportedly taking a stake in NFDG, a joint venture firm founded by Friedman and Gross. NFDG has already made notable investments in successful AI startups such as Perplexity AI and Character.AI. This investment strategy, coupled with the direct hiring of individuals like Gross and potentially Friedman, indicates a multi-pronged approach by Meta to deepen its ties with the leading edge of AI innovation, both through direct employment and strategic investment in the ecosystem. This comprehensive strategy is aimed at rapidly bolstering Meta’s internal AI talent pool and external network. Earlier in the month, Meta also announced the hiring of Alexandr Wang, the CEO of Scale AI, a prominent data labeling company crucial for training AI models, along with several other executives from his firm. These hires collectively represent a significant influx of high-level AI expertise into Meta, covering areas from research and development leadership to data infrastructure and startup investment perspectives. The race for top AI talent is fierce, and Meta is clearly demonstrating its willingness to invest heavily to secure the best minds in the field. Why AI Talent is Crucial for Meta’s Future The emphasis on acquiring top AI talent is paramount for Meta as it pushes towards ambitious goals, including building Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and developing the metaverse. Building advanced AI requires not only massive computational resources but also the visionary leadership and technical expertise to guide complex research projects and translate them into practical applications. Individuals like Ilya Sutskever, Daniel Gross, Nat Friedman, and Alexandr Wang bring diverse yet complementary skill sets essential for navigating the challenges of frontier AI research and development. Their experience in building companies, leading large technical teams, and investing in innovative technologies can significantly beef up Meta’s AI superintelligence lab and accelerate progress. The ability to attract such high-profile individuals also sends a strong signal to the rest of the industry about Meta’s commitment to being a leader in the AI space. This strategic focus on AI talent acquisition is a critical component of Meta’s long-term vision, impacting everything from their social media platforms to their hardware initiatives like smart glasses and future metaverse endeavors. Concluding Thoughts on Meta’s AI Pursuit Meta’s pursuit of Safe Superintelligence, followed by its focused effort to hire Daniel Gross and other key figures like Nat Friedman and Alexandr Wang, underscores the company’s aggressive strategy to become a dominant force in artificial intelligence. The failed acquisition of a $32 billion startup did not deter Meta; instead, it seems to have intensified their efforts to onboard the minds behind such ventures. This talent acquisition drive, coupled with strategic investments, is a clear indication of where Meta sees its future and the resources it is willing to commit to achieving its AI ambitions. The outcomes of these hiring efforts will likely have a significant impact on the competitive landscape of the AI industry and Meta’s position within it for years to come.

According to reports, the suspect, Veer Chetal, pleaded guilty to fraud and money laundering conspiracy charges after his parents were kidnapped. According to court documents that were unsealed this week, 19-year-old Chetal from Danbury, Connecticut, has also agreed to testify against his co-defendants. The Connecticut native was one of three men charged in an online scam last August, stealing about 4,100 Bitcoins from their victim, a resident in Washington D.C. Reports claimed that the trio used the proceeds from the heist to live a luxury lifestyle, spending millions on cars, jewelry, rental mansions and nightclub parties. Connecticut native docked for Bitcoin theft after parents’ kidnap According to authorities, a week after Chetal and his co-conspirators carried out the crime, his parents were kidnapped and assaulted. Although the attack failed, authorities believed that the attacker had aimed to use the kidnap to coerce Chetal, who they believed had a large amount of digital assets, into using part of the funds to secure his parents’ release. Chetal’s parents were said to be in their new Lamborghini SUV when the attackers forced them out and assaulted them. Police, at the time, mentioned that after they were taken, the attackers bound them and forced them into their waiting van. Witnesses immediately called the police. The police were able to react quickly, arresting four men after they abandoned their vehicles and the van to flee on foot. Two other suspects were later arrested at a nearby home the group rented through an Airbnb, authorities said. During the hearing, one of the defendants, Michael Rivas, apologized for his actions. He said it was a dumb idea and he only did it to help one of the co-defendants who had a vendetta, although he did not elaborate. Meanwhile, his lawyer said that he only accepted to be a part of the gang in hopes of getting a share of the loot. At the time, there were reports of a Bitcoin theft where the assailants had been reportedly involved in a massive spending spree. Chetal agrees to testify against his co-defendants The criminal case involving the Connecticut native was unsealed on Monday in a Washington federal court, revealing his guilty plea in November and an agreement to cooperate with federal authorities investigating the Bitcoin theft. It also revealed the prosecutors are looking into new allegations that he was involved in about 50 other thefts where he stole more than $3 million from November 2023 to September 2024. Authorities also claimed that Chetal was also involved in a $2 million crypto theft that took place in October, but refused to tell them about it. Last September, federal agents with a search warrant raided the Connecticut native’s Brunswick, New Jersey apartment and his parent’s home in Danbury in connection to the Bitcoin theft. Investigators mentioned that they found more than $500,000 in cash, expensive jewelry and watches, and luxury clothes. Federal agents also added that Chetal had about $39 million worth of digital assets that he turned over to investigators. Authorities claimed that Chetal could face deportation as part of the criminal case. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

While Solana is a well-mounted layer-1 blockchain gaining momentum with institutional adoption and DeFi activity, Ozak AI is a growing celebrity within the world of artificial intelligence and decentralized analytics. Both projects have bold goals for 2025—Solana eyeing $300, and Ozak AI aiming for a large 200x surge from $0.005 to $1. But the paths they comply with, and the possibilities they present, are fundamentally different. Solana: Speed, Adoption, and Technical Rebound Solana has demonstrated itself to be one of the fastest and most scalable blockchains, capable of processing thousands of transactions in keeping with second with extremely-low expenses. Its growing surroundings consist of decentralized exchanges, NFT systems, or even traditional finance integrations. With backing from the principal price range and a robust developer network, Solana is placed to play a key role within the next crypto bull run. The SOL price has been rebounding steadily, and many analysts assume a retest of its all-time high around $260. The cutting-edge chart suggests bullish signs and symptoms after surviving the 2022 downturn, with key resistance stages at $185, $230, and $300, at the same time as help ranges are visible at $145, $120, and $98. If Solana breaks above the $230 range, momentum ought to push it quickly closer to the $300 mark by 2025, particularly if the broader marketplace turns bullish. Youtube embed: Next 500X AI Altcoin Ozak AI: Predictive Analytics Meets Blockchain Innovation On the other hand, Ozak AI is not another blockchain—it’s an advanced AI-native analytics platform that blends machine learning with decentralized infrastructure. By integrating components such as: The Ozak Stream Network (OSN) for real-time data flow DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network) for scalable AI workloads Prediction Agents for market intelligence Ozak Data Vaults for data security and monetization Ozak AI is building a powerful ecosystem for financial forecasting and decision-making. Currently in Stage 4 of its presale at $0.005, Ozak AI has already raised over $1.2 million and has been listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko . The team’s vision of democratizing predictive analytics in crypto and traditional finance is gaining traction. A successful launch and listing could propel the token toward its ambitious $1 target, potentially offering early investors 200x returns—a growth path rarely seen in the post-ICO era. Ozak AI vs Solana: Which One Is the Better Bet? Solana and Ozak AI represent two ends of the investment spectrum. Solana is more established, less risky, and already has significant market penetration. A move from $150 to $300 would offer a 2x return, which is excellent for a top-10 coin with strong fundamentals. Ozak AI, however, represents the high-risk, high-reward category. With a small market cap, cutting-edge utility, and the AI narrative in its favor, the token has the potential to multiply many times over if it gains adoption and delivers on its promises. Ultimately, Solana is the safer growth bet, but Ozak AI could be the moonshot that defines the next altcoin season. Wise investors may consider a diversified approach—balancing the reliability of Solana with the explosive potential of Ozak AI.

With rising institutional inflows and the sustained interest around spot ETF approvals, the second-largest cryptocurrency continues to prove itself as a cornerstone of decentralized finance. Its network upgrades and strong market cap have kept it at the forefront of crypto innovation. But while Ethereum (ETH) maintains its dominance, a new name is making waves from the grassroots up: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is still in presale, yet it has already raised around $10.85 million and attracted more than 12,250 holders at a presale price of just $0.03 per token. What sets it apart from traditional protocols is not only its entry point but also its powerful earning mechanics and the infrastructure being built for long-term decentralized growth. For investors who want strong upside potential from a lower base, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will offer more than just speculative gains—it will deliver real DeFi utility. DeFi Lending Reimagined—Built for Yield, Built for Access Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will function as a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity protocol that allows users to lend and borrow various crypto assets using two models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). In the P2C model, users will deposit assets like Ethereum (ETH), USDC, USDT, Solana (SOL), Binance Coin (BNB), Bitcoin (BTC), or Avalanche (AVAX) into smart contract-based liquidity pools. These deposits will automatically earn interest as they get borrowed by others. As pool usage rises, interest rates will increase dynamically, attracting more lenders and creating a high-yield cycle tied to real demand. The P2P model will give lenders full control, allowing them to negotiate terms directly with borrowers. Users will be able to lend even less commonly supported assets like Pepe (PEPE), Dogecoin (DOGE), or Shiba Inu (SHIB)—tokens that are often ignored by centralized platforms. This flexibility will appeal to active users who want more personalized control and higher reward strategies. Once an asset is deposited into the pool, users will receive mtTokens—tokenized representations of their deposit and interest accrual. These mtTokens will serve as yield-bearing instruments and can be staked to earn passive income from protocol profits. As usage expands, users who lock their mtTokens in designated contracts will receive MUTM token dividends bought in the open market from market revenue. This creates a rewarding loop for early believers. Layer-2 integration will also give the platform an edge. Lower transaction fees and faster execution times will ensure that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) functions efficiently even during market congestion. The protocol’s CertiK audit, with a Token Scan Score of 80.00 and a Skynet Score of 72.38, will add an extra layer of confidence for users exploring new DeFi options. Stablecoin Utility and MUTM Token Value—Driving Real Ecosystem Demand Another major development is the upcoming launch of Mutuum’s decentralized stablecoin. It will maintain a $1 peg and will be minted only when a user borrows against on-chain collateral, such as ETH. This stablecoin will be automatically burned when loans are repaid or liquidated. Unlike traditional models that rely on fiat or centralized reserves, this one will use algorithmic governance to manage supply and interest rates. Interest rates for borrowing this stablecoin will not be decided by market speculation. Instead, governance will adjust the rates to help stabilize the peg. This system will allow the stablecoin to become a foundational utility layer within the Mutuum ecosystem. Only approved issuers will be allowed to mint this stablecoin, with individual allocation caps to ensure responsible usage. The MUTM token itself will be the centerpiece of the entire protocol. With a supply of 4 billion tokens, MUTM will be used to distribute passive dividends, and incentivize users who stake mtTokens. Most importantly, its long-term value will be tied directly to protocol activity—every time someone borrows, lends, or interacts with liquidity pools, value will flow through to token holders. MUTM Is Built to Last—Presale Progress, Ecosystem Momentum, and Beta Launch Plans According to the current roadmap, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is preparing to launch a beta version of its lending and borrowing platform by the time the token goes live. This will mark a key milestone in usability and provide early adopters with a hands-on experience of the system in action. The project is also running a $100K giveaway , where ten winners will be awarded with $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each—rewarding those who supported the project early in its journey. All deposits will be handled through secure, non-custodial smart contracts. Users will always retain control of their funds and can redeem their mtTokens anytime, assuming sufficient liquidity is available. Interest rates will shift dynamically in P2C lending, while in P2P, users will set their own terms. This dual approach will ensure flexibility and adaptability to various market conditions. For those looking to borrow instead of sell, Mutuum will allow access to liquidity without losing exposure to long-term holdings. Whether someone wants to borrow against ETH to invest in other opportunities or manage short-term costs, this strategy will allow them to keep control of their assets while still participating in the broader DeFi market. Through an intelligent combination of dynamic interest systems, passive income rewards, algorithmic stablecoin mechanics, and real yield opportunities, the project is projecting a complete financial ecosystem for the decentralized future. With presale still active and the price fixed at $0.03, there is a narrow window before the next price jump begins. Those who act now will secure a stronger position in what could become one of the most talked-about DeFi protocols of the year.

Bitcoin’s price has lost almost 3% on the day, while major altcoins such as Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and others chart even more considerable declines. Bitcoin Price Tumbles toward $103K Bitcoin is charting a near 3% loss in the past 24 hours in what seems to be a broader crypto market selloff. As seen in the chart below, the price tumbled from around $106,000 to an intraday low at $102,400 before bouncing and settling at where it current trades at the time of this writing. Source: TradingView As CryptoPotato reported, however, the common theme amongst the majority of cryptocurrency analysts and experts is that Bitcoin’s price trading at around $100,000 is indicative of institutional dominance and not retail FOMO. This suggests that it has much more staying power because institutions are a lot less likely to sell during temporary and sudden drawdowns like the current one. At the same time, however, the war between Israel and Iran continues , driving oil prices up and causing turmoil on stock markets as well. Altcoins Crash Harder than BTC The heatmap below paints a clear picture: most of the altcoins are trading in the red and are charting consiedrable losses. Namely, some of the larger-cap cryptocurrencies such as ETH, SOL, ADA, DOGE, HYPE, BCH, LINK, AVAX, and more, are declining for more than 3% during the past 24 hours. Interestingly enough, Bitcoin’s dominance – the metric, which tracks its share relative to that of the rest of the market is up by more than 1% during the same period. This shows that BTC is performing a lot better and altcoins are completely unable to capitalize on its drawdown. In fact, this seems to be the other theme of the current cycle.

While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Bitcoin: Pioneering a New Era of Digital Currency Bitcoin, often dubbed the world's first cryptocurrency, has revolutionized the way we think about money. Introduced by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, it offers a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that operates without a central authority. Unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin isn't printed or minted; it's a digital asset maintained by a distributed network of computers called nodes. Transactions are verified by miners through a process of solving complex puzzles, ensuring the integrity and security of the network. This innovative system removes the need for intermediaries like banks, making transactions faster and potentially more secure. As we navigate the current market cycle, Bitcoin's potential continues to spark interest. The network undergoes a ""halving"" approximately every four years, reducing the reward for miners by half. This process, designed to cap the total supply at 21 million bitcoins, can influence the network's stability and mining profitability. Compared to newer cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin remains the most established and widely recognized. Its limited supply and increasing adoption suggest a resilient future, though the market remains volatile. Whether Bitcoin is an attractive option now depends on individual perspectives, but its pioneering technology and growing role in the financial world are hard to ignore. ADA Coin: Cardano's Green Revolution in the Crypto World Cardano is shaking up the cryptocurrency scene. It's a platform built for smart contracts, making it easy to create apps, tokens, and games without middlemen. Its coin, ADA, competes with Ethereum's ETH. With ADA, users can store value, make payments, and help secure the network by staking. What makes Cardano special is its eco-friendly approach. It uses proof-of-stake, which is much more energy-efficient than the methods used by many other cryptocurrencies. In today's market, ADA shows great promise. Cardano's technology allows fast transactions, potentially handling up to a million per second. This speed comes from its unique two-layer system, separating transactions from smart contracts. Since 2021, Cardano's native tokens have made interactions with smart contracts safer and cheaper. As the crypto world moves towards sustainability and efficiency, ADA stands out. It's an attractive option for those interested in the future of cryptocurrency. Monero: Your Money, Your Business Monero (XMR) was launched in 2014 with a clear goal: to let people make private transactions. While many think Bitcoin hides their identity, it's actually easy to trace payments back because blockchains are open for all to see. Monero changes this by using advanced cryptography to hide both the sender and the receiver. The team behind Monero puts privacy and security first. They want everyone to have protection, no matter how tech-savvy they are. Monero aims to let payments happen quickly and cheaply, without fear of censorship. In a world where digital footprints are everywhere, Monero offers a way to keep your financial dealings to yourself. This makes it stand out from other cryptocurrencies that are less private. With growing concerns about data privacy, Monero's technology has big potential. In the current market, where regulations are tightening, a coin like Monero could become more attractive. It provides a level of anonymity that others don't. As more people seek privacy, Monero might see increased interest compared to more transparent coins. Chainlink: Bridging Blockchains with the Real World Chainlink is changing how smart contracts work. It connects them to real-world data, like prices and events. This makes them more useful and powerful. Chainlink uses a network of oracles to fetch and verify data. These oracles have a reputation score to ensure the data is accurate. The system combines on-chain and off-chain processes. On-chain, it manages data requests. Off-chain, it gathers the data. The LINK token powers this ecosystem. It rewards those who provide data and keeps the network secure through staking. In the current market, Chainlink stands out. Its ability to connect blockchains with external data fills a crucial gap. As more decentralized apps emerge, the need for reliable data grows. Unlike some coins that offer limited utility, LINK has a clear purpose. Its technology is mature compared to newer projects. With the increasing focus on DeFi and real-world asset tokenization, Chainlink's role becomes even more important. Investing in LINK could be attractive for those looking at long-term growth in the crypto space. Conclusion BTC, ADA, XMR, and LINK are strong options, but XYZVerse ($XYZ) stands out as the first sports memecoin, aiming for 20,000% growth with its unique blend of memes and sports.

Key Takeaways: CoinMarketCap was hacked after a fake wallet verification popup appeared on its site, triggering phishing concerns. MetaMask and Phantom flagged the site as unsafe, warning users against connecting wallets. The breach has revived criticism of CoinMarketCap’s security, nearly four years after its major data leak. The phishing-style notification asked users to connect their wallets and approve ERC-20 token access, raising immediate red flags across the crypto community. Wallet providers like MetaMask and Phantom quickly flagged the site as unsafe, with Phantom displaying a browser warning against using the platform. CoinMarketCap Removes Malicious Popup In a Friday post on X , CoinMarketCap confirmed the removal of the malicious popup. “We’ve identified and removed the malicious code from our site,” the platform said. The company added that it is continuing to investigate the breach and is reinforcing its security measures to prevent similar incidents. Update: We've identified and removed the malicious code from our site. Our team is continuing to investigate and taking steps to strengthen our security. — CoinMarketCap (@CoinMarketCap) June 21, 2025 The malicious prompt, which triggered warnings from wallet providers like MetaMask and Phantom, reportedly asked users to connect their wallets and approve access to ERC-20 tokens. Phantom’s browser extension even flagged CoinMarketCap as “unsafe to use,” raising concerns about the platform’s vulnerability. Reports of the phishing attempt began circulating across crypto social media, with several users alerting others not to interact with the prompt. Many suspected the attack was an attempt to steal wallet credentials through a fake interface mimicking a legitimate verification process. The incident has reignited concerns about CoinMarketCap’s security, coming nearly four years after a 2021 data breach exposed the email addresses of over 3.1 million users. That data was later discovered for sale on hacking forums, prompting criticism over the platform’s safeguards.

Users are urged to avoid connecting wallets to unsolicited prompts and to verify all interactions through official channels. The company has not disclosed the source of the breach but has committed to ongoing security reviews. Crypto Crime Turns Violent as Illicit Transactions Top $40B in 2024 Illicit cryptocurrency activity surged to at least $40.9 billion in 2024, according to Chainalysis, with the number likely to grow as more criminal-linked wallets are identified. Hacks alone accounted for $2.2 billion in stolen assets, a 21% increase from the previous year. North Korean-linked groups, including Lazarus and Tradetraitor, were behind over 60% of those thefts, with major incidents like the $300 million hack of Japan’s DMM Bitcoin exchange among their hits. But the threats go beyond online exploits. Criminal groups are using crypto to fund and conceal a wider range of crimes—from investment scams and AI-enhanced romance frauds to drug trafficking and even physical violence. In one alarming case on May 13, 2025, the daughter and grandson of Paymium’s CEO were nearly kidnapped in Paris by masked men.

Whether it’s Elon Musk tweets or short-lived exchange hype, these meme coins are attracting a new wave of speculative buyers. But beyond the headlines, serious investors are asking a deeper question—what happens after the hype fades? That’s where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) enters the conversation—not as a meme, but as a fully structured protocol building out its own DeFi ecosystem. At just $0.03, it trades at meme-level prices, but the similarities end there. With a functional roadmap, over 12,300 holders, and more than $10.85 million raised in its Phase 5 presale, this is not another short-term play. It’s a platform in development, designed to serve users through decentralized lending, on-chain stablecoin issuance, Layer-2 infrastructure, and passive income strategies. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is more than just a token Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will introduce a next-generation DeFi protocol, offering both P2P and P2C lending models. In the Peer-to-Contract format, users will deposit digital assets—like USDC, USDT, ETH, or AVAX—into liquidity pools. These deposits will earn variable interest based on pool demand. For each deposit, users will receive mtTokens (such as mtDAI or mtETH), which act as interest-earning receipts. These mtTokens will not only represent claimable value but can also be used throughout the DeFi space for additional financial strategies. That’s the difference between idle crypto and composable assets. Someone depositing 1,000 DAI into a Mutuum lending pool will receive 1,000 mtDAI, which will accrue interest and can be used in other protocols or staked within Mutuum itself—unlocking another layer of passive earnings. And in the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model, lenders will directly negotiate custom terms with borrowers, opening access to lend less common assets like Pepe (PEPE), Dogecoin (DOGE), or Shiba Inu (SHIB)—tokens usually excluded from traditional platforms. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will also offer real incentives for users. All protocol revenue will be used to buy back MUTM tokens, which will then be redistributed to mtToken stakers. This makes every active user part of the revenue cycle. With token staking planned post-launch, users will gain regular rewards not based on hype, but on actual usage of the lending platform. At its beta launch besides the token listing, early users direct access to testnet functions as the DApp nears completion. Mutuum’s roadmap includes Layer-2 integration, which will bring lower transaction costs and faster execution—two things meme coins can’t offer no matter how popular they become. Stablecoin innovation: real-world utility built on-chain While meme tokens fluctuate wildly, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is focused on building real utility—beginning with its decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin. This stablecoin will maintain a $1 peg not through reserves or centralized backing, but through algorithmic issuance and transparent smart contracts. It will only be minted when users borrow against collateral—like ETH—and will be burned automatically once the loan is repaid or liquidated. Only approved issuers will be allowed to create the stablecoin, and each will have a preset minting cap to control risk. The interest rate for borrowing this stablecoin will not float with the market, but will instead be governed by Mutuum’s own protocol governance. This mechanism will help keep the stablecoin anchored to $1 through direct rate adjustments and arbitrage opportunities. The stablecoin system will function as a core utility layer within the protocol—enabling borrowing, yield farming, and platform liquidity. Overcollateralization and automatic liquidation will ensure systemic security, giving users confidence that this isn’t just a price-peg experiment—it’s a usable asset backed by logic, not trust. And unlike speculative coins with no financial foundation, Mutuum’s upcoming stablecoin will be part of an ecosystem where every component is tied to platform growth. From lending interest to stable borrowing rates, to staking rewards and token buybacks—every activity will fuel the same long-term economic loop. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also running a $100,000 giveaway to increase early community engagement. Ten winners will receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each—rewarding those who believed in the project before the exchange listing. With over 4 billion tokens in total supply and the current price locked at $0.03, there is clear upside for early backers who understand that utility, not speculation, drives sustainable growth. SHIB and DOGE may dominate social feeds, but they do little to serve users beyond entertainment. In contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is preparing to launch with a full beta, mtToken access, decentralized stablecoin, and a protocol-level staking engine. For investors looking to get in before the DApp goes live and before MUTM hits exchanges, this is the final stretch of real utility at a discount. The choice between speculative cycles and platform fundamentals is clear—and in late June, the market’s smartest pick won’t bark.

This rate corresponds to $55.69 million worth of NEIRO tokens. EmberCN identified 13 different wallet addresses linked to Trend Research. It was noteworthy that all of these addresses contained NEIRO tokens. These wallets, which have 64.25% of the total supply, made large withdrawals of NEIRO from Bybit and Gate exchanges between March 24 and May 30. During the same period, NEIRO's price increased by approximately 6 times, from $0.0165 to $0.1155. EmberCN suggested that this increase was largely due to the buying activity of these addresses. Related News: FED Official Daly Gives Date for Interest Rate Cut Excluding exchange, market maker, and pool addresses among the top 21 NEIRO owner addresses, it was determined that all the remaining major owners belonged to these 13 wallets. LD Capital founder JackYi made the following statement on the subject: “I bought with real money on the secondary market, I didn’t sell. At that time, memecoins were popular, I wanted to buy when the market value was low. I patiently hope to become one of the leaders of the ETH ecosystem. I bought more and naturally became one of the main owners. In my opinion, buying with real money on the secondary market is not an unethical behavior.

Stablecoins may be the most underappreciated financial infrastructure of our time. In the West, discourse on stablecoins remains trapped between compliance and innovation, despite their quiet role as an indispensable financial tool for millions across emerging markets. You might also like: Rethinking money in the web3 era: From capital to code, narrative, and moral design | Opinion From remittances and cross-border trade to on-chain yield and enterprise-grade payments, the most meaningful and scalable stablecoin use cases are no longer incubated in Silicon Valley or on Wall Street but on the streets of Lagos, Buenos Aires, and Ho Chi Minh City. For many individuals in these markets, stablecoins represent a redefinition of what money is, how it moves, and who it works for. For investors, the message is clear: the future of digital finance will increasingly be co-authored by communities that build solutions out of necessity rather than novelty. Emerging markets as proving grounds Born out of necessity, stablecoins have become foundational to economic participation across Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia. In Venezuela, where hyperinflation and currency collapse destabilised the local bolívar, stablecoins account for nearly half of crypto transactions under $10,000. Elsewhere, stablecoins represent up to 43% of Sub-Saharan Africa’s total crypto transaction volume, mirroring a similar pattern of widespread currency devaluation and growing demand for USD-pegged stability. Similarly, with the majority of the country’s population lacking banking access, people in Vietnam are also turning to stablecoins to relieve the cost burden of high remittance fees. Many SMEs and gig workers are increasingly leaning on digital payments solutions like stablecoins to avoid high fees and FX conversion bottlenecks. Such examples prove that emerging markets are, in fact, real-world stress tests for the next chapter of global finance, and hotspots for investors seeking growth where traditional systems fall short. Generation dollar: Banking the next generation Disrupted trade flows, rising import costs, and weakening currencies impact the global economy, but it is the emerging markets in the Global South that bear the greatest brunt of instability. One in seven people across the world who rely on remittances will have to bear the high transfer costs that can reach up to 8.2% , cutting into income that could otherwise support food, education, or medical bills. For this next generation of digital-native workers, entrepreneurs, and small businesses, navigating today’s economy requires fast, resilient, and stable borderless financial tools. Stablecoins have become exactly that: reliable financial instruments that enable millions to hedge against volatile environments. From enabling freelancers in Southeast Asia to receive instant payments to helping merchants in Africa reduce FX exposure, such tools provide tangible, dollar-based resilience to everyday users. A new “generation dollar” is emerging; one that is no longer bound by the realms of legacy institutions but is building its own parallel economy via alternative payment rails and digital currencies. Investors—like us at Foresight Ventures—should take note of this sobering reminder of the real-world challenges experienced by those our portfolio companies are serving. Smart capital is ultimately about empowering builders who are solving real financial frictions, bridging access gaps, and overcoming yield constraints in regions where traditional finance continues to fall short. Rebuilding finance from the phone up As DeFi becomes more embedded in everyday financial flows, the future of finance will be built into digital mobile wallets, and not banks. This wallet-native model is reshaping access in some of the world’s most underserved regions, returning financial control to individuals and small businesses. Tools like PayFi help bridge the gap between on-chain yields and real-world spending, enabling users to hold dollar-denominated assets providing 5–8% yield, instant settlement, and borderless payments. Such tools become important micro-financial systems in countries like Morocco and Vietnam, where the majority of the population remains unbanked. With mobile-first interoperable infrastructure that merges yield, liquidity, and utility in a single interface, stablecoins offer a level of financial agility that traditional systems cannot match, reducing cross-border fees from 6.65% globally to near-zero. And this is key: as stablecoins, yield protocols, and DeFi rails converge in the palm of the hand, the next chapter of global finance will be downloaded. As investors race to catalyse wallet ecosystems, we are witnessing the industry unlocking new forms of economic agency and inclusion. The new financial power play With mobile-first adoption and rising economic pressure, financial power is becoming more democratised by technology. Emerging markets are at the heart of this shift, leading the next chapter of financial innovation, and adapting socioeconomic fabrics in tandem with the progress of crypto-native infrastructure. Need and ingenuity are colliding in the Global South, a living laboratory for scalable, durable, and inclusive financial innovation. For investors in the space, realising web3’s full potential now depends on bridging the ideological and structural divide between East and West. We need to combine the regulatory clarity and capital depth of developed markets with the grassroots innovation and real-world deployment that we’re seeing from the Global South. This requires investment not just in technology, but in geography, where capital in wallet infrastructure, stablecoin rails, and programmable yield protocols that are locally attuned and globally interoperable can build a truly inclusive financial system, one that scales both innovation and impact.

The BTC price slipped back to the $102k zone before regaining the crucial $103k mark. The global digital assets market cap dropped by 2% over the past 24 hours to stand at $3.2 trillion. Its 24-hour trading volume surged by 40% to hit $112 billion, suggesting that traders are moving their funds quickly amid surging uncertainties. However, the fear and greed index flashes “neutral” sentiment among the investors. Liquidations soar to $500M The day that began with Bitcoin hitting $106K saw it dropping below $103,000 in a matter of hours. The pullback wasn’t limited to BTC as Ethereum (ETH) plunged by as much as 4.5% in just a couple of hours. ETH price fell to a low of $2,375 as its trading volumes spiked by 89% to hit $22 billion. Ether is trading at an average price of $2,425 with a marginal recovery. Solana, Cardano, and the biggest meme crypto, Dogecoin, were also swept up in the selloff. Their price dropped between 3% and 5% during the same session. Meanwhile, Sei has turned out to be the biggest gainer among the top 100 crypto. Sei price is up by 10% in the last 24 hours and is trading around $0.22 at press time. The sell-off has triggered widespread liquidations across the crypto derivatives market. CoinGlass data shows that 127k traders got liquidated over the last 24 hours, as the liquidations went on to hit $495 million. The single largest liquidation order of BTC/USD valued at $8 million happened on Bybit. Source: CoinGlass Around $413 million worth of liquidated positions (84%) turn out to be long bets. This suggests that traders were hoping that bullish momentum would continue ahead, but the cumulative crypto market printed red indexes. Ethereum liquidations outpaced Bitcoin’s, totaling $177 million compared to Bitcoin’s $122 million. Bitcoin is trading at an average price of $103,485 at press time, which traders have been watching closely for a while. Its 24-hour trading volume is up by 34% to stand at $48.8 billion. Bitcoin’s overheating zone cleared? According to CryptoQuant data , the heatmap chart tells the story that the $103K liquidation cluster, which previously acted as a concentration point for overleveraged long positions, was completely dismantled. As Bitcoin broke through this key level, a sharp wick pushed prices below $102,500, flushing out traders who had entered long positions with insufficient margin or poor risk management. Binance’s liquidation delta chart corroborates this move, showing a pronounced spike of over $160 million in long liquidations within minutes of the breakdown. Simultaneously, Binance’s Net Taker Volume, smoothed over a seven-hour moving average. It plunged deeply into negative territory, hitting nearly negative $100 million. It’s the third time this month the metric has nosedived to such extremes. The metric showed that the sell-off may have felt brutal in the moment, but events like these can ultimately be constructive. Aggressive liquidations and deep negative taker volumes typically signal that speculative excess has been flushed from the system. It suggests that the removal of weak-handed leverage can make the way for more stable price action. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

One critical piece of this puzzle is crypto custody – the safekeeping of digital assets. Enter Komainu, a prominent player in this space, backed by some heavy hitters in traditional finance and the digital asset world. They’ve just announced ambitious plans that signal a major push for global market share, aiming to become a leading digital asset custodian outside the United States. This move is set to reshape the competitive landscape and underscores the increasing maturity of the institutional crypto market. Why is Global Expansion Key for Komainu’s Crypto Custody Goals? Komainu’s strategy isn’t just about getting bigger; it’s about strategically positioning itself in key markets around the world. While the U.S. market presents its own opportunities and challenges, many other regions are developing clearer regulatory frameworks for digital assets. By focusing on global expansion , particularly outside the U.S., Komainu can tap into burgeoning demand from institutions and corporations in Europe, Asia, and beyond. This allows them to build a diverse client base and navigate different regulatory environments, potentially finding more favorable conditions for growth in certain areas. Here are some drivers behind this strategic focus: Regulatory Diversity: Different countries have varying approaches to digital asset regulation. Establishing a presence in multiple jurisdictions allows Komainu to operate under different rule sets and cater to clients seeking specific regulatory environments. Market Opportunity: Institutional adoption of digital assets is accelerating globally. Komainu aims to be on the ground in key financial hubs to capture this growing demand directly. Competitive Landscape: The non-U.S. market presents a unique competitive environment compared to the U.S., allowing Komainu to leverage its specific strengths and partnerships. How is Komainu Pursuing This Global Expansion? The core of Komainu’s plan involves strategic acquisitions. Acquiring existing businesses in target regions offers several advantages over building from scratch: Benefits of the Acquisition Strategy: Speed to Market: Acquisitions allow Komainu to quickly establish a foothold in a new region, bypassing lengthy licensing and setup processes. Local Expertise and Relationships: Acquired companies bring established teams with local market knowledge, existing client relationships, and understanding of regional regulations. Immediate Infrastructure: Acquisitions provide ready-made operational infrastructure and technology, which can then be integrated with Komainu’s existing platform. Licensed Operations: Crucially, acquiring licensed entities allows Komainu to begin operating legally in a new jurisdiction almost immediately. A prime example of this strategy is Komainu’s recent acquisition of Singapore-based Propine. Singapore is a significant financial center in Asia with a clear regulatory framework for digital asset service providers. Acquiring Propine gives Komainu an immediate licensed presence in this crucial Asian market, serving as a springboard for further expansion in the region. The Power of Backing: Nomura, CoinShares, and Ledger Komainu isn’t just any startup; it boasts impressive backing from industry giants. Nomura, a global financial services group, brings traditional finance expertise and institutional connections. CoinShares, a leading digital asset investment firm, provides deep knowledge of the crypto market and institutional investor needs. Ledger, a global leader in digital asset security hardware, contributes cutting-edge technology for secure storage. This powerful triumvirate provides Komainu with: Advantages of Komainu’s Strategic Partnerships: Partner Key Contribution Benefit to Komainu Nomura Traditional Finance Expertise, Institutional Network Credibility with institutional clients, access to traditional finance pipelines CoinShares Digital Asset Investment Expertise, Market Insights Understanding of institutional investor needs, product development guidance Ledger Hardware Security Technology Industry-leading security infrastructure for asset protection This combination of traditional finance credibility, crypto market understanding, and robust security technology positions Komainu uniquely to serve the complex needs of institutional crypto investors seeking a reliable digital asset custodian . Scaling Up: Team Growth and Asset Management Supporting this ambitious global expansion requires significant operational scaling. DL News reported that Komainu plans to increase its staff from 70 to 120 by the end of the year. This nearly doubling of the team is essential to handle the increased workload from integrating acquisitions, expanding service offerings, and managing operations across multiple new regions. Komainu currently holds over $10 billion in assets under management (AUM), a testament to the trust placed in its platform by existing clients. The successful $75 million funding round in January further bolsters its financial position, providing the capital necessary to fund acquisitions and fuel this rapid growth trajectory. What Challenges and Opportunities Lie Ahead for Komainu? While the path for Komainu’s expansion looks promising, challenges remain: Potential Challenges: Regulatory Hurdles: Navigating the patchwork of regulations across different countries remains complex and requires constant vigilance. Integration Risks: Successfully integrating acquired companies, their technology, and their teams can be challenging. Competition: The crypto custody market is competitive, with both established players and new entrants vying for market share globally. Market Volatility: The inherent volatility of digital asset markets can impact AUM and client sentiment. However, the opportunities are significant: Key Opportunities: Growing Institutional Adoption: Increasing interest from banks, asset managers, and corporations presents a massive growth opportunity for reliable custodians. Expansion into New Asset Classes: As the digital asset landscape evolves, Komainu can potentially expand custody services to tokenized securities, NFTs, and other emerging digital assets. Establishing Market Leadership: Successful execution of the expansion strategy could position Komainu as a dominant non-U.S. digital asset custodian . Becoming a Top Non-U.S. Digital Asset Custodian Komainu’s stated goal of becoming a top non-U.S. provider highlights a strategic focus on capturing market share outside the often-scrutinized U.S. regulatory environment. This doesn’t mean avoiding regulation, but rather engaging with jurisdictions that are actively developing clear and functional frameworks for digital assets. Their expansion into Asia (starting with Singapore) and Europe demonstrates this targeted approach. By building a strong, compliant, and technologically advanced custody network across these key regions, Komainu aims to be the go-to partner for institutions worldwide looking to safely and securely engage with the digital asset space. Conclusion: Komainu’s Bold Step in Crypto Custody Komainu’s plan for global acquisitions and significant team expansion represents a bold and strategic move in the crypto custody market. Backed by the formidable resources and expertise of Nomura, CoinShares, and Ledger, and with over $10 billion in assets already under custody, Komainu is well-positioned to pursue its goal of becoming a leading digital asset custodian outside the U.S. The acquisition of Propine is just the first step in what appears to be an aggressive push into key international markets. As the institutional appetite for digital assets continues to grow globally, Komainu’s proactive global expansion strategy could prove instrumental in shaping the future of secure digital asset management.

Recent whispers suggest that Reddit is exploring a potential integration with Worldcoin, the ambitious project co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, specifically looking at its unique iris-scanning device, the Worldcoin Orb, for enhancing user authentication. This news, first reported by Solid Intel on X, has ignited significant discussion across the tech and cryptocurrency worlds. While it remains unconfirmed by official sources from either Reddit or Worldcoin, the mere possibility raises fascinating questions about the future of online identity, privacy, and how platforms like Reddit might combat persistent issues like bots and fake accounts using biometric verification. What’s the Buzz About Reddit and Worldcoin Orb? The core of the recent report centers on discussions between Reddit and Worldcoin regarding the potential deployment of the Worldcoin Orb. The idea is that this unique hardware device could be used to verify that a Reddit user is a unique human being, creating a form of ‘Proof of Personhood’ tied to their account. Here’s what the report suggests: Reddit is reportedly in talks with Worldcoin. The focus is on using the Worldcoin Orb technology. The primary application would be for user authentication on the platform. The goal likely involves verifying unique human users. Crucially, this remains an unconfirmed report from a third-party source (Solid Intel on X). It’s important to approach this news with caution, as no official statements have been released. However, the exploration of such a partnership, even at the discussion stage, signals a potential shift in how major online platforms might address identity verification challenges. Understanding the Worldcoin Orb and Biometric Verification At the heart of Worldcoin’s ecosystem is the Worldcoin Orb. This is a custom-built, silver sphere equipped with sophisticated optical sensors designed to perform highly accurate iris scans. The process works by capturing a detailed image of a person’s iris pattern. Worldcoin states that the Orb converts this scan into a unique numerical code, called an IrisCode, which is then used to verify that the individual has not previously signed up for Worldcoin. The stated goal is to create a global digital identity system, allowing individuals to prove they are a unique human online without necessarily revealing their real-world identity (depending on the level of privacy desired). This process is a form of biometric verification, using biological characteristics (the iris) for identification or verification purposes. Key aspects of the Worldcoin Orb and its biometric verification process: Hardware: A physical device equipped with specialized cameras and sensors. Function: Scans the unique patterns of a person’s iris. Output: Generates a unique IrisCode (a numerical representation) from the scan. Purpose: To verify uniqueness – confirming that a person hasn’t been verified by the Orb before. Claimed Privacy: Worldcoin claims the IrisCode is not linked back to the raw biometric image after processing and is designed to protect individual privacy, though this claim is heavily debated. For Reddit, integrating this would mean users who opt-in could potentially verify their account using an Orb scan, proving they are a distinct individual. This differs significantly from traditional authentication methods like passwords, email verification, or even two-factor authentication, which don’t necessarily verify uniqueness across the entire platform. Why Would Reddit Consider Worldcoin for User Authentication? Reddit, like many large online platforms, faces persistent challenges with bots, spam, and maintaining genuine interactions. A significant portion of activity can be driven by automated accounts or individuals creating multiple profiles. This degrades the user experience, distorts discussions, and can be used for malicious purposes. Implementing a robust form of user authentication that verifies uniqueness could offer several potential benefits for Reddit: Combatting Bots and Spam: By verifying that each account is tied to a unique human, it becomes significantly harder and more expensive for malicious actors to operate vast networks of bots or create disposable accounts for spamming or harassment. Enhancing Trust and Authenticity: A verified ‘human’ status could increase trust within communities, allowing users to distinguish between potentially legitimate accounts and unverified ones. Improving Community Quality: Reducing bot activity could lead to more genuine discussions and interactions, improving the overall health and quality of the platform’s diverse communities. Potential for New Features: A verified digital identity could potentially unlock new features or permissions within Reddit, such as access to sensitive communities, higher posting limits, or enhanced voting power, exclusively for verified users. Data Security (Potentially): If implemented correctly, tying identity to a unique biometric ID rather than relying solely on easily compromised passwords could, in theory, enhance account security against certain types of hacking, although it introduces new risks related to biometric data handling. For Reddit, exploring Worldcoin’s approach to user authentication is likely driven by the desire to create a more authentic and secure environment for its users, tackling problems that traditional methods have struggled to solve effectively on a massive scale. The Big Questions: Privacy, Security, and Centralization Concerns While the potential benefits of using biometric verification for user authentication on a platform like Reddit are clear, Worldcoin’s approach has been steeped in controversy since its inception. Integrating the Worldcoin Orb would inevitably bring these significant concerns to the forefront for Reddit users. The primary concerns revolve around: Privacy of Biometric Data: The most significant worry is the collection and handling of sensitive biometric data (iris scans). Although Worldcoin claims the raw images are deleted and only the IrisCode is stored, the idea of a company holding a database of unique biometric identifiers for potentially millions or billions of people raises profound privacy implications. What happens if this data is breached? Unlike a password, a compromised iris scan cannot be changed. Centralization of Power: Worldcoin, despite its cryptocurrency component (WLD), relies on a centralized entity (Tools for Humanity) to operate the Orbs and manage the initial verification process. Handing over a critical part of user identity verification to a third-party, particularly one with control over such sensitive data, raises questions about corporate control and potential misuse. Data Security: While the Orb process is designed to be secure, the infrastructure managing the IrisCodes or any associated data could be a target for sophisticated attacks. The potential fallout from a breach involving biometric data is far more severe than traditional data breaches. Accessibility and Equity: Requires access to a physical Orb device, which might not be readily available to everyone globally, creating potential barriers to entry or verification for some users. Ethical Considerations: The practice of scanning people’s irises, sometimes in exchange for cryptocurrency tokens, has faced criticism, with concerns raised about informed consent and potential exploitation, particularly in developing nations. Any move by Reddit to adopt Worldcoin’s Orb would need to transparently address these complex issues and build significant user trust, which could be a major hurdle given the existing controversies surrounding Worldcoin’s operations and its approach to digital identity. Sam Altman, Worldcoin’s Vision, and Digital Identity Understanding the context of Worldcoin requires looking at the vision behind it. Co-founded by Sam Altman, the project aims to create a global ‘Proof of Personhood’ network. In an increasingly digital and AI-driven world, the ability to definitively prove you are a unique human, not a bot or an AI, is seen by proponents as becoming essential. Worldcoin’s long-term vision extends beyond simple authentication. It includes the distribution of WLD tokens to verified individuals, potentially laying the groundwork for future universal basic income (UBI) schemes. The Orb is the tool to achieve this unique human verification at scale. The exploration by Reddit suggests that major platforms are starting to seriously consider solutions for verifying unique humans in the digital realm, and Worldcoin’s biometric verification method is one of the most prominent (and controversial) attempts at solving this challenge of creating a verifiable digital identity. What Are the Potential Implications for Reddit Users? If Reddit were to proceed with integrating Worldcoin’s Orb for user authentication, it would likely be an optional feature, at least initially. Users could potentially choose to verify their account with an Orb scan to gain certain benefits or status on the platform. For users who opt-in: They would need to locate a physical Worldcoin Orb and complete the scanning process. Their Reddit account would likely receive a ‘verified’ badge or status indicating they are a unique human. They might gain access to features or communities restricted to verified users. For users who do not opt-in: Their experience might remain largely unchanged, though they could potentially be excluded from features available only to verified users. They might interact more with verified users, potentially leading to higher-quality discussions in some areas. However, they might also face increased scrutiny or be seen as less trustworthy compared to verified accounts. The implications are significant, potentially creating a two-tiered system on the platform and requiring users to weigh the benefits of verification against the privacy implications of providing biometric data. Is Biometric Verification the Future of Digital Identity? The reported interest from a platform as large as Reddit highlights a growing need for robust digital identity solutions. Passwords and email verification are no longer sufficient to combat sophisticated bot networks and verify uniqueness online. Biometric verification, using methods like iris scans (Worldcoin), fingerprints, or facial recognition, offers a seemingly definitive way to link an online identity to a unique physical person. However, the trade-offs in terms of privacy, security risks (especially if data is centralized), and accessibility are substantial. Other approaches to digital identity are also being explored, including decentralized identity solutions built on blockchain technology, which aim to give users more control over their data. The potential Reddit Worldcoin collaboration represents one possible path forward, focusing on a biometric-centric, centrally managed verification process, which stands in contrast to decentralized alternatives. Conclusion: Weighing the Reported Exploration The report that Reddit is exploring the use of Worldcoin’s Orb for user authentication is a development with potentially far-reaching consequences. On one hand, it presents a compelling opportunity for Reddit to tackle long-standing issues with bots and spam by implementing a strong form of biometric verification, enhancing the authenticity and quality of interactions on the platform. On the other hand, it brings with it the significant controversies and privacy concerns surrounding Worldcoin’s collection and handling of sensitive biometric data and its centralized operational model. For Reddit users, it would mean confronting the decision of whether the benefits of a verified account outweigh the risks associated with providing an iris scan to a third party. As of now, this remains a report, not an official announcement. The discussions may or may not lead to an actual integration. However, the fact that such a possibility is reportedly being considered by a major platform like Reddit underscores the growing importance of robust digital identity solutions in the age of AI and advanced bots, while also highlighting the complex ethical and privacy challenges that come with biometric verification technologies like the Worldcoin Orb. It’s a bold step to consider, but one that comes with substantial potential risk and scrutiny.

A recent experiment by the University of Zurich revealed just how persuasive AI can be in online debates, raising urgent concerns about the authenticity of digital interactions. As a result, Reddit is now exploring a radical solution—integrating Worldcoin’s biometric ID system to verify real human users. What Is Worldcoin and How Does Its Biometric ID Work? Worldcoin is a crypto-based identity and finance project co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. At the heart of the project lies World ID, a digital passport that proves your “humanness” without revealing personal details. This ID is created by scanning your iris using a specialized device called the Orb. The iris scan generates a unique “IrisHash,” which helps confirm that the user is a real person—not a bot or AI—while claiming to protect your privacy by deleting the scan after the hash is created. Why Reddit’s Interest in Worldcoin Matters According to a report from a top-tier media outlet , Reddit is actively exploring a partnership with Worldcoin to integrate its biometric ID system. Unlike platforms such as Instagram or TikTok, Reddit thrives on text-based, community-driven conversations. But those discussions are increasingly undermined by fake accounts and AI-generated content. Integrating a system like World ID could help Reddit ensure that real people are behind the posts—preserving the integrity of its communities. AI, Bots, and the Growing Need for Human Verification The rise of AI-generated comments, fake upvotes, and bot-driven manipulation is eroding trust across platforms. Worldcoin’s biometric verification system offers a way to fix this. By confirming each user’s uniqueness with an iris scan, Reddit could: Improve moderation Reduce fake engagement Restore community trust Interestingly, Tinder is also testing the same system in Japan to verify age and identity, showing its potential to scale across platforms that depend on real human interaction. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Elon Musk Is Building a DEX on Twitter—What This Means for Crypto , What About Privacy and Anonymity? Worldcoin’s approach hasn’t been free from controversy. Critics argue that collecting biometric data—even temporarily—opens up serious privacy and regulatory concerns. While the company insists that it does not store the iris image, multiple countries have launched investigations and even halted operations over data retention and user consent issues. Meanwhile, the U.S. is drafting a law that would require platforms like Reddit to verify user age, mainly to protect minors from harmful online content. Reddit’s Dilemma: Anonymity vs Authenticity Reddit is known for allowing anonymity, which is key to open and honest discussions. The potential integration of Worldcoin presents a unique solution—ensuring users are real while preserving pseudonymity. No names, no faces—just a verified human behind the screen.At a time when AI content and bots threaten the very fabric of digital dialogue, Reddit’s move to adopt biometric ID verification could be the first step toward making the internet human again. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

46466660,https://timestabloid.com/?p=72075,1750497735,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Expert On XRP Price: This is the Floor Before Institutions Take Over,https://timestabloid.com/expert-on-xrp-price-this-is-the-floor-before-institutions-take-over/,"Professional gamer and cryptocurrency enthusiast Chad Steingraber has weighed in on recent XRP market activity, stating that “most XRP sellers have been retail, and yet still the price is holding over $2 the entire time.” According to Steingraber, this persistent price level, despite widespread selling from individual investors, represents “the floor before institutions take over.” His comment followed data released by blockchain analytics firm Glassnode that pointed to a significant wave of profit-taking in early June 2025. Steingraber’s assessment reflects a growing belief among market participants that the current XRP price floor is being maintained in preparation for potential institutional entry . He implied that retail traders may be exiting their positions prematurely, while larger market players have yet to fully engage. His observation came at a time when XRP remains above $2, despite notable realized profits from earlier buyers. Most XRP sellers have been retail, and yet still the price is holding over $2 the entire time. This is the floor before institutions take over. https://t.co/xlRSlTtWVL pic.twitter.com/m5DG0FmPkM — Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) June 19, 2025 Glassnode Data Shows Strong Profit Realization Glassnode’s latest chart illustrates the realized profits of XRP investors categorized by profit margin. According to their tweet, XRP is now trading at over three times the level it was before the rally that began in November 2024. Holders who accumulated earlier are now sitting on gains exceeding 300%. During the first week of June 2025, realized profits hit $68.8 million per day based on the seven-day simple moving average, a strong indicator of distribution activity. The chart shows these profit realizations in aggregate, with clear spikes aligning with major price movements. The most significant realized profit volumes appeared after XRP surged past $2, with selling behavior becoming more visible in early 2025. Despite these substantial exits, XRP’s price has shown resilience, remaining elevated and avoiding sharp reversals. Retail Investors Taking Profits While Others Hold The selling trend described by Glassnode and echoed by Steingraber suggests that many retail investors chose to lock in gains after the sharp rally. However, not all market participants have taken that path. A user named Vincent, replying to Steingraber’s post, stated , “Not me I didn’t sell a single xrp unlike most retail I actually have diamond hands not selling till my targets hit.” His comment reflects a segment of the retail base committed to longer-term holding, even amid high profitability. It’s important to note this divide in behavior among retail investors. While some are realizing substantial profits, others are maintaining their positions, expecting further appreciation. The fact that both behaviors coexist while the price remains stable indicates strong market liquidity and steady demand absorption. As XRP continues to trade in this elevated range, analysts and investors will closely watch for shifts in ownership patterns, especially signs of increased institutional allocation. For now, data shows that early holders are locking in gains, while others wait for higher targets, and XRP’s price continues to hold firm above $2.

The launch opened external connectivity to Pi’s blockchain, enabling real-time utility and expanding access to developers, merchants, and over 13 million mainnet users globally. The 100-day celebrations did not do much for the price of Pi Coin (PI), which has struggled to gain upward momentum and is now trading below $0.60. PI coin minimal price movement. Source: CoinGecko The coin failed to break the $0.61 resistance marked by the 50-period exponential moving average, with current trading volumes hovering at $77 million, down 35% compared to the seven-day average. $100M Pi Network venture fund and Pi Day 2025 According to a blogpost , in 100 days, the Pi Foundation launched Pi Network Ventures, an initiative backed by a $100 million pool split between Pi and USD. The Pi team asserted that the initiative will help finance startups and businesses that build on or integrate the Pi ecosystem. It added that the fund would prioritize projects that drive commercial use and practical applications of the Pi coin. Other additions to the ecosystem includes FruityPi, a fruit-matching mobile game introduced by Pi Network. Pi Day 2025, held on March 14, was the beginning of the first PiFest event following the Open Network launch. The week-long event, which ran through March 21, brought in more than 125,000 registered merchants, including 58,000 active sellers. “During the first 100 days of Open Network, Pioneers have demonstrated that the adopted, utility-based Pi cryptocurrency is here to stay and grow,” the foundation stated. The community-driven “Map of Pi” application recorded over 1.8 million Pioneer users during the event, while more than 45,000 reviews were submitted. PiFest became a testbed for real-world commerce within the Pi ecosystem. pi Domains auction crosses 69,000 Last Tuesday, Cryptopolitan covered the launch of the .pi Domains auction, where users and businesses could acquire exclusive domain identifiers within the Pi ecosystem. Per the foundation’s report, more than 123,000 active bids have been placed so far by over 57,000 unique participants. In total, over 69,000 domains now have active bids, with more than 3 million Pi staked during the ongoing auction process. The Pi Foundation says the domains have immediate utility, easier app discovery, brand visibility, and user personalization. Pi Network has also rolled out updates to its mainnet ecosystem interface since February. Developers can now deploy apps via the Developer Portal without the prior whitelist approval requirement. In a move to support monetization, Pi App developers have been invited to apply for the Pi Ad Network. Those selected will join the first group of apps from the pilot program already receiving ad revenue. The network is seemingly building an economically sustainable ecosystem for developers and content creators. Since February 20, more than 3 million additional Pioneers have migrated to the mainnet, raising the total to over 13 million users. Blockchain activity is on the uptick, with more than 7.4 billion Pi migrated, 5.2 billion locked and 2.2 billion unlocked. Network data shows over 400,000 nodes now active across testnet1, testnet2, and the mainnet, according to Pi Network’s internal blockchain explorer.

These Crypto Projects Offer Real Utility and Long-Term Potential,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/looking-for-the-best-altcoin-to-buy-now-these-crypto-projects-offer-real-utility-and-long-term-potential/,"Crypto investors are once again scanning for altcoins with real utility and long-term upside, with June drawing to a close and market sentiment tilting cautiously bullish. Cardano (ADA) remains a steady presence in the smart contract market, recently stabilizing around $0.62, as developers double down on scaling and governance upgrades. But the real heat in the market is building around Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a rising DeFi project that’s being hailed as one of the top tokens to watch before June ends. Mutuum Finance is in phase 5 of its presale. Over $10.9 million has already been raised and more than 12,300 investors have joined. With interest climbing and social chatter accelerating, some are already calling MUTM the best crypto to buy in 2025, citing its strong fundamentals and early-stage entry potential. Mutuum Finance Presale Heats Up in Phase 5, Price Set at $0.03 Mutuum Finance is lighting up the DeFi sector, and Phase 5 of its presale is flying along with tokens still at just $0.03. With a launch price of $0.06, investors in today can look to enjoy a seamless 2x profit. But it doesn’t stop there, with an estimated gain of 1200% after launch, this may be one of the biggest DeFi plays going on right now. Over $10.9 million has already been raised and more than 12,300 investors are on hold and ready to ride. To make things even sweeter, the next presale round takes the price to $0.035, so anyone who invests now will capture an instant 16.67% profit. The opportunity to realize these profits is rapidly fading, and astute money is already moving. Mutuum Finance Giveaway Is Live To celebrate its early momentum and reward the community Mutuum Finance is hosting a massive $100,000 giveaway . Ten lucky early investors will be selected to receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. Through its unique leaderboard mechanism the top 50 MUTM holders are being showcased and rewarded. As the users climb ranks they get bonus tokens making token holding a competitive one that is fun. The mechanism drives both loyalty and thrill and helps drive ecosystem growth in a high-speed manner. Audited and Constructed for the Long Term Mutuum Finance is adding legitimacy to its hype. Certik has provided a full audit of its smart contracts which assures investors that the code is secure transparent and long-lasting. And to further enable its ecosystem to be even more stable Mutuum Finance is building a fully collateralized USD-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum that will bring long-term stability liquidity and trust to retail and institutional customers. Mutuum Finance continues to capture attention as one of the most promising altcoins heading into the second half of 2025. With over $10.9 million raised and a growing base of more than 12,300 investors, its Phase 5 presale at $0.03 offers early entrants the chance to double their investment before launch at $0.06. Backed by a Certik audit, a powerful dual lending model, and a fully collateralized stablecoin in development, MUTM delivers real-world utility that sets it apart from hype-driven tokens. Add in a $100,000 community giveaway and a gamified leaderboard that rewards top holders, and it’s clear why many see this as the best crypto to buy now.

46466990,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=775424,1750498217,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/46466990.jpeg,"XRP Price Crash Tests Critical Support At $2.1, Will It Break?",https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-crash-tests-2-1/,"After the market crash that sent the Bitcoin price falling toward $100,000, the XRP price also saw a notable decline, and this crash has brought it toward an important level. While the digital asset continues to hold above the $2.1 level, it remains critical support and a break below this could be negative for the price. This is outlined by crypto analyst The Alchemist Trader, who has shown what direction the XRP price could be headed in depending on what happens here. XRP Price Threatens Major Support Level After the almost 4.5% decline that ravaged the XRP price over the last week, it has been pushed down toward the next major support level, lying just above $2.09. So far, the bulls have defended this level, but the multiple tests suggest that a breakdown at this level could be in view. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts 20% Ethereum Price Crash Below $2,000, Here’s Why The analyst explains that the reason this level is so important is that it actually includes the value area low recorded in previous declines. Additionally, it is the 200-day moving average (MA) for the cryptocurrency, and also now serves as a key daily support/resistance flip. This means either camp of the bulls and bears can pull it in their direction, making it incredibly important for what happens to the XRP price in the short term. Given the importance of this level, whether it holds or breaks will carry serious implications for the XRP price. In the bearish scenario, the crypto analyst explains that a break below this support would trigger a liquidity sweep as the price dumps lower. The possibility of a break is even higher now, given that this level has already been tested multiple times. The Alchemist explains that each test weakens the level, putting it at risk of a breakdown. However, with long consolidation so far above this level, there is a bullish scenario that is rising. As bulls continue to maintain this support, further strength here could erode the possibility of a decline. If properly defended with a notable uptick in volume, in addition to a move upward into the recent local highs at $2.4, then it is likely that the XRP price continues to move up. Related Reading: Ethereum Bullish Wave Towards ATH Coming? Here Are The Targets “For bulls, a clean defense of this level with volume and a move back above recent local highs would indicate a potential rotation toward the next resistance,” the analysis read. “For bears, a breakdown without a reclaim increases the likelihood of continuation to the downside.” As for how to play the current trend, the analyst advises investors to exercise caution and wait for confirmation before taking positions. The confirmation here would either be a break below the support or a strong upward rally away from it, signaling a clear direction.

For those following the intersection of tech, digital assets, and creative output, the rise of AI-generated music presents both innovation and potential pitfalls, particularly concerning streaming fraud . Music streaming giant Deezer is taking a significant step to address this growing issue head-on. Deezer AI Implements Clear Labeling for AI-Generated Music Deezer recently announced a crucial update to its platform: the introduction of clear labeling for albums containing AI-generated music . This move is part of a broader effort to increase transparency and combat fraudulent activities that are becoming increasingly prevalent in the music streaming space. According to Deezer, a significant volume of music uploaded daily is now fully AI-generated. While not all of this content goes viral, a large percentage of its streams are reportedly fake, designed solely to illicitly claim royalties. Deezer’s new policy aims to make it easy for listeners to identify AI content and for the platform to better manage its impact. The Growing Threat of Streaming Fraud The numbers shared by Deezer highlight the scale of the challenge. The company reports that approximately 18% of daily music uploads, amounting to over 20,000 tracks, are now entirely AI-generated. Furthermore, they estimate that around 70% of the streams on these tracks are fraudulent, created to manipulate royalty payouts. This type of streaming fraud undermines the integrity of the streaming ecosystem and unfairly impacts human artists and songwriters who rely on genuine listenership for their income. Deezer’s actions are a direct response to protect its platform and the legitimate artists within it. How Deezer AI Combats Fraudulent Streams Deezer’s strategy involves several key measures: Clear Labeling: Albums featuring AI-generated tracks are now explicitly tagged, providing transparency to listeners. Playlist Exclusion: AI-generated tracks will not be included in Deezer’s editorial playlists. Algorithm Filtering: These tracks will also be excluded from algorithm-based recommendations, reducing their visibility. Royalty Payment Filtering: Fraudulent streams identified are being filtered out to prevent improper royalty distribution. These steps are intended to make it harder for fraudulent content to gain traction and to ensure that royalty payments reflect genuine listening activity. AI Music Detection is Key to Platform Integrity While currently making up a small percentage of total streams (around 0.5%), the volume of AI-generated music being uploaded is growing rapidly. Deezer CEO Alexis Lanternier noted the significant uptick in recent months and emphasized the industry-wide nature of the issue. Effective AI music detection is becoming essential for streaming platforms to maintain integrity. Lanternier stressed that while AI itself isn’t inherently good or bad, a responsible and transparent approach is crucial for building trust with users and the music industry. The company is also focused on safeguarding the rights of artists and songwriters amidst ongoing debates about copyright and AI training data. Industry Context: AI, Copyright, and Music Streaming Deezer’s move comes at a time when the relationship between AI startups and major record labels is particularly tense. Reports indicate that Universal Music Group, Warner Music Group, and Sony Music Entertainment have been in discussions with AI startups like Udio and Suno regarding licensing their catalogs. These talks often occur in the shadow of lawsuits filed by the record companies alleging copyright infringement by the AI platforms. Any licensing deals could potentially resolve these legal disputes, but they also highlight the complex challenges the entire music streaming industry faces in navigating the rapid advancements of AI technology and its impact on content creation, distribution, and monetization. Conclusion: A Step Towards Transparency in AI Music Deezer’s decision to label AI-generated music and actively combat associated streaming fraud represents a proactive step towards greater transparency and fairness in the digital music space. By clearly identifying AI content and implementing measures to filter fraudulent activity, Deezer aims to protect the value of human creativity and build trust with its users and the artist community. As AI continues to evolve, such measures will likely become standard across the industry to ensure a healthy and equitable environment for creators and listeners alike.

A sharp shift in demand momentum and rising Global Liquidity Index (GLI) has caught the eye of veteran analyst Crypto Rover. Let’s break down what the latest signals are telling us. Bears Are Backing Off, Bulls Taking Over According to a chart shared by Crypto Rover, Bitcoin’s demand momentum has plunged deep into negative territory. In simple words, short-term sellers are pulling back, while long-term holders are stepping in. Historically, this kind of shift tends to happen near market bottoms, often just before big price rallies. The bears are capitulating. Bitcoin demand momentum is deep in the red. A reversal is imminent! pic.twitter.com/3Nf0GmTJDH — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) June 21, 2025 At the same time, Bitcoin’s trading volume jumped 20% in the past 24 hours, reaching $47 billion . The spike in volume reflects a mix of panic selling and opportunistic buying, a classic sign of bear capitulation. Adding to the bullish signs, major players are placing bold bets. One whale, in particular, is holding a massive 20x long position on Bitcoin , valued at over $364.35 million, reflecting a growing confidence in BTC. Liquidity and Bitcoin in Sync Interestingly, Rover also compared recent Bitcoin’s price to global liquidity trends. Historically, when global liquidity rises, Bitcoin tends to follow suit, sometimes with explosive results. Notably, the current Global Liquidity Index (GLI) level mirrors the period when Bitcoin was trading around $100,000, implying that if the pattern holds, Bitcoin could soon revisit or even surpass this price point. Bitcoin will explode. Just like the global liquidity did. Watch this chart closely! pic.twitter.com/E5PRD48R3S — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) June 21, 2025 What Should Traders Watch Next? Volume Trends: Sustained high trading volumes could confirm that the capitulation phase is ending, signaling that selling pressure is subsiding. Support Levels: The $103,400 level remains a critical support zone. Holding above this threshold is essential for a bullish reversal. Technical Indicators: Watch for bullish crossovers in the MACD and RSI moving out of oversold territory, currently at 45 .

As companies like OpenAI push boundaries and secure major contracts, particularly in sensitive sectors like defense, questions arise about the stability of existing alliances. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and tech watchers alike, understanding these power shifts is crucial, as they often dictate the pace of innovation and market direction. A recent development involving OpenAI and the U.S. Department of Defense highlights potential strains on the crucial OpenAI Microsoft relationship , sparking significant discussion. Understanding the OpenAI Defense Contract OpenAI recently secured a substantial $200 million contract with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). This deal marks a significant step for OpenAI into the defense sector, a move that has historically been met with mixed reactions within the tech community. For OpenAI, it represents a major revenue stream and an opportunity to apply its advanced AI capabilities to complex national security challenges. However, it also raises questions about the ethical implications of deploying powerful AI in military applications and how this aligns with the company’s stated mission and values. How Does This Impact the OpenAI Microsoft Relationship? Microsoft is OpenAI’s largest backer, having invested billions and providing essential computing infrastructure through Azure. This partnership has been foundational to OpenAI’s rapid development and scaling. Yet, reports of growing tensions between the two companies have surfaced, particularly as they increasingly compete for lucrative AI enterprise deals . The DoD contract adds another layer of complexity. While Microsoft is also a major defense contractor, OpenAI operating independently in this space could be seen as both a potential collaboration point and a source of competitive friction. Will this deal strengthen OpenAI’s independence to a degree that challenges Microsoft’s influence, or will it be viewed as a natural extension of OpenAI’s growth, albeit in a sensitive area? Silicon Valley’s Growing Ties to the Military The OpenAI/DoD deal is reflective of a broader trend: Silicon Valley’s increasingly cozy relationship with the military. After a period where many tech companies shied away from defense work due to ethical concerns voiced by employees and the public, there’s a noticeable shift. Industry leaders are now actively engaging with defense agencies, driven by factors like national security priorities, significant funding opportunities, and perhaps a changing perception of the role tech should play. Some voices are even calling for an AI “arms race,” arguing that staying ahead in AI development, particularly for defense, is critical for geopolitical reasons. This engagement raises important questions about the future direction of AI development and its primary applications. The Competition for AI Enterprise Deals Beyond defense, the competition for AI enterprise deals is heating up across all sectors. Both OpenAI and Microsoft are vying to provide AI solutions to businesses, government agencies, and organizations worldwide. Microsoft integrates OpenAI’s models into its products (like Copilot), but it also develops its own AI capabilities. OpenAI, while partnered with Microsoft, also pursues direct relationships with large customers. This overlap creates a natural tension. The DoD contract is essentially a very large, very specific enterprise deal. Its success or challenges could influence how other large organizations view contracting directly with OpenAI versus going through Microsoft’s integrated offerings. Navigating the Future of AI The dynamic between OpenAI, Microsoft, and the defense sector is a key indicator of the complex path ahead for artificial intelligence. The future of AI involves not just technological advancement but also navigating intricate business relationships, ethical considerations, and geopolitical forces. The $200 million DoD contract underscores that AI is no longer confined to research labs or consumer apps; it’s a critical component of national strategy and economic competitiveness. The ability of OpenAI and Microsoft to manage their partnership while pursuing independent goals, especially in sensitive areas like defense, will significantly shape the AI landscape for years to come. Other Signals from the Tech Landscape The recent discussions around the OpenAI/Microsoft dynamic were part of a broader conversation about key events in the tech world. Other highlights from the week included: Examining the implications of public figures like Vice President JD Vance joining social platforms like Bluesky. Analyzing surprising acquisitions, such as Wix buying a young startup focused on “vibe coding” for a significant sum, prompting debate on emerging tech trends and terminology. Insights from industry experts on what constitutes valuable technical talent in an era increasingly dominated by AI tools and capabilities. These diverse topics collectively paint a picture of a tech industry in constant flux, driven by innovation, market forces, and evolving societal interactions. Conclusion: A Partnership Under Pressure? OpenAI’s significant deal with the U.S. Department of Defense is more than just a contract; it’s a litmus test for its relationship with its most important partner, Microsoft. While collaboration remains strong in many areas, the increasing competition for major deals, particularly in strategic sectors like defense, introduces undeniable friction. The outcome of this dynamic will not only influence the trajectory of both companies but also the broader direction of AI development, its integration into critical infrastructure, and the ongoing debate about the role of tech in national security.

Long-term forecasts suggest potential highs of $35.60 by 2030. Worldcoin made waves in early 2024 when its token WLD nearly hit $12, but since then, it has struggled to break past key resistance levels, even during bullish market events. With price action losing steam and investor interest fading, many wonder if the project is losing its shine. As it is backed by Sam Altman and focused on decentralized identity, Worldcoin is quietly building in the background. working hard in silence, maybe with the ongoing AI crypto bull run gaining momentum, Sam Altman’s brainchild, Worldcoin, could possibly create a significant buzz. As AI narratives gain traction, many are intrigued to know, “What does the future hold for Worldcoin?” or “Could WLD stage a comeback?” Let’s delve into the anticipated Worldcoin price predictions for 2025 to 2030 and the years to come Table of contents Overview CoinPedia’s WLD Price Prediction Worldcoin Price Prediction 2025 WLD Price Forecast 2026 – 2030 Worldcoin Price Forecast 2026 WLD Price Prediction 202 7 Worldcoin Price Forecast 2028 WLD AI Token Price Forecast 2029 Worldcoin AI Token Price Prediction 2030 Market Analysis FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency WorldCoin WDC Token WDC Price $ 0.00349731 -10.28% Market Cap $ 0.00 Circulating Supply 0.00 Trading Volume $ 5.1958 All-time High $11.82 on 10th March 2024 All-time Low $0.9758 on 13th September 2023 CoinPedia’s WLD Price Prediction As per Coinpedia’s Worldcoin Price Prediction, marketers’ optimism and the involvement of high-profile figures could significantly boost Worldcoin’s potential value. Further, this credibility and backing, combined with a potential increase in trading volume, could drive the price of WLD Coin to an impressive $5.89 by the end of 2025. If the market faces external pressures, then it could potentially drive the price down to a low of $1.61 . Price Prediction Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) 2025 1.61 3.25 5.89 Worldcoin Price Prediction 2025 The Q2 2025 price action for Worldcoin (WLD) clearly showed signs of exhaustion before it could push higher. Despite recent optimism, its inability to establish a sustained, long-term bullish trend remains evident. Looking at its historical performance, the recent Q2’s gains appear modest, like a mere bucket of water from a deep well. Since early 2024, WLD is still down over 80% from its highs, even with the latest price surge. The entire weekly price action on the Binance exchange resembles a converging price action structure in a falling channel. This pattern occurrence highlights the odds of future good returns remaining high. When a catalyst activates, it will shoot a breakout from this range. Many are now asking: What could truly push Worldcoin higher? As seen time and again in the crypto space, social sentiment is often the key driver. Renewed marketing efforts and the involvement of high-profile figures could significantly enhance Worldcoin’s value. If, in the coming sessions, optimistic momentum builds up, then WLD must achieve a Change of Character (ChoCh) in its current price structure by breaking above the $2.12 level in June or July. Once this level is cleared and a ChoCh is confirmed, Worldcoin could break out of its bearish pattern and potentially retest the $4.18 level by the end of 2025.

This week’s most notable news is that Bit2Me, one of Spain’s biggest crypto exchanges, is planning to expand operations in Latin America. Paraguay, on the other hand, has announced a new effort to combat Bitcoin-based hacking and extortion as the country’s cryptocurrency sector expands. Bit2Me targets Latin American expansion Bit2Me, a renowned cryptocurrency exchange in Spain, has announced plans to expand into Latin America as part of its global growth strategy. The company plans to raise revenue from $24 million in 2024 to $26 million in 2025 through a combination of global expansion and strategic relationships with local banks in major markets such as Argentina, Peru, Brazil, and Mexico. Bit2Me is also planning to reach additional European markets such as Portugal, Italy, and France, aided by its efforts to secure the MiCA license. With over 1.2 million members and €3 billion in transaction volume in 2024, Bit2Me is focusing on compliance and advanced security measures, cementing its position as one of Spain’s most secure exchanges. Cyber attacks surge in Paraguay Paraguay has recently become a common target of cyberattacks, with hackers frequently demanding Bitcoin as a sort of ransom. These attacks, which include the theft of sensitive data and ransomware campaigns, have targeted both public and commercial organisations. The hacking of President Santiago Peña’s official Twitter account resulted in a false announcement about Bitcoin legalisation, causing alarm. Although the account was immediately restored, the breach exposed the country’s digital weaknesses and the growing complexity of cyber attacks. In response to these growing risks, Paraguay implemented the National Cybersecurity Strategy 2025-2028. Gustavo Villate, Minister of Information and Communication Technologies, spearheads the plan, which focuses on critical infrastructure protection, cybersecurity training, and international cooperation. The Armed Forces are also playing an important part in the implementation. The strategy intends to make Paraguay’s digital ecosystem more secure by decreasing human error and strengthening institutional resilience. However, its success is dependent on excellent execution and collaboration with allies such as the United States, Israel, and Taiwan. Brazil’s B3 exchange launches Ethereum and Solana futures B3, Brazil’s biggest stock exchange, announced futures contracts for Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) on Monday, boosting its portfolio of regulated cryptoassets as demand for blockchain-based financial products grows. The new derivatives represent a significant step for B3, which has been progressively establishing a regulated crypto market ecosystem in Latin America’s largest economy. The contracts will be priced in US dollars and reference the Nasdaq Ether and Nasdaq Solana Reference Prices. This development is a significant milestone for Brazil’s financial system, demonstrating the country’s willingness to incorporate regulated cryptocurrency products within a regular exchange structure. By providing advanced tools to both institutional and retail investors, B3 is positioning Brazil as a regional leader in crypto finance while also encouraging innovation in the country’s expanding digital asset ecosystem.

Rumors of a new token, UMP, drive pre-market activity and social chatter. No official announcement has been made, but speculation continues to build. Speculation over a potential airdrop by Pump.fun is heating up in online prediction markets. The popular blockchain-based prediction platform Polymarket is tracking market sentiment around when Pump.fun might launch an airdrop. As of today, June 21, two major dates have attracted the most attention: June 30 and July 31. According to the latest odds, a June 30 airdrop is viewed as highly unlikely. Traders have placed over $29,000 in volume on this outcome, with shares for “Yes” trading at just 1.7 cents, reflecting only a 1% probability. In contrast, the market gives a July 31 airdrop a 30% chance, with “Yes” shares trading at 34 cents. Volume for this date is slightly higher at $29,562, signaling strong market interest in a later launch. Essentially, traders on Polymarket see only a 1% chance of a June airdrop but assign a 30% likelihood that it will occur by July 31.

By 2028, DOGE may potentially achieve a peak price of $1.06. By 2031, DOGE might touch $1.72 with an average trading price of $1.65. Propelled by a dedicated community of part-time developers and enthusiastic internet supporters, Dogecoin is poised for significant growth in the coming years. Despite relying on borrowed code due to limited resources, its popularity continues to soar, with tens of thousands of social media followers advocating for supply limitations. Having touched its ATH at $0.7376, will DOGE reach $1? Let’s get into the Dogecoin price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Dogecoin Token DOGE Price $ 0.162 (-4.35%) Market Cap $24.43B Trading Volume (24-hour) $967.27M Circulating Supply 149.77B DOGE All-time High $0.7376 May 07, 2021 All-time Low $0.00008547 May 07, 2015 24-hour High $0.1717 24-hour Low $0.1589 Dogecoin price prediction: Technical analysis Volatility 11.11% 50-Day SMA 0.204214 14-Day RSI 32.88 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 49 (Neutral) Green Days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA 0.19061 Dogecoin price analysis: DOGE faces bearish pressure as it drops toward $0.162 TL;DR Breakdown : Dogecoin price analysis confirmed a downtrend as the price declined toward $0.162. Cryptocurrency loses 4.35% of its value. DOGE coin prices seek support at $0.158. On June 21, 2025, Dogecoin price analysis revealed a decreasing trend for the meme coin. The coin value corrected further to $0.162 in the past 24 hours. From an overall observation, the currency went through a loss of 4.35 percent today. However, buyers’ support seems to be present at $0.160, but they have been unable to provide sufficient cushion as the price has been falling for a third consecutive day. Dogecoin 1-day price chart analysis The one-day price chart of Dogecoin confirmed a downward trend in the market. The cryptocurrency value has stepped down to $0.162 today. Red candlesticks on the price chart signify persistent selling pressure. The coin underwent a heavy correction yesterday, but the bearish pressure seems to be subsiding today. DOGE/USD shows increasing volatility The distance between the Bollinger bands defines the volatility. This distance is widening, leading to increasing volatility. Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance, has shifted to $0.199, whereas its lower limit, serving as the support, has moved to $0.159. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator has dropped near the border of the over sold area. The indicator’s value has decreased to index 34.15 in the past 24 hours. The descending curve on the RSI graph signifies a rising bearish strength. If the selling activities continue to accelerate, the RSI level might head toward the oversold region. DOGE/USD 4-hour price analysis The four-hour price chart of Dogecoin also confirmed a downward trend in the market. DOGE/USD value has been facing increasing bearish volatility toward $0.162 level. The increasing volatility signals a higher chance of a trend reversal and higher price oscillation in the coming hours. However, sellers are still holding the DOGE price below $0.165. DOGE/USD 4-hour price chart The Bollinger Bands are diverging, leading to increasing volatility. This increase in volatility signifies a higher market unpredictability. Moving ahead, the upper Bollinger band has shifted to $0.174, indicating the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger band has moved to $0.161, showing the support point. The RSI indicator is plummeting and is trending in the lower neutral region near the borderline of the oversold area. Its value has deteriorated to index 37.75 in the past four hours. This decrease in the RSI level shows the rising bearish threat below EMA trend lines, which might weaken the upcoming support levels, and the coin may fall below them.

Dogecoin price analysis gives a bearish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. The coin value has deteriorated to a low of $0.162 in the past 24 hours. If sellers maintain their pressure, DOGE’s price might trigger further declines and head toward $0.159. On the other hand, a successful rebound from the current levels might trigger renewed buying demand as the RSI level is nearing the oversold region, which may bring new opportunities for traders. Is DOGE a good investment? Dogecoin has strong potential for growth due to its high adoption and strong community. However, DOGE is highly volatile and its unlimited supply raises questions about its future price. Social media news and trends also highly affect the meme coin, so diversification and research are advised. The coin is expected to touch the $0.615 level by 2026. Why is DOGE down? DOGE’s price decreased to $0.162 over the last 24 hours as bearish momentum continued around immediate support channels. Moreover, sellers are currently dominating the price action. What is the expected value of Dogecoin in 2025? Dogecoin is expected to trade at an average price of $0.329854 in 2025. Will DOGE reach $0.50? If the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish, DOGE will join the rally. As a meme coin, it runs mostly on positive speculation. It’s expected that the coin will touch this level by June 2027. Will DOGE reach $1? Considering Dogecoin’s current value, $1 is still a far-reaching target. However, robust community support for this meme coin can push it to $1 by 2028. Will DOGE hit $10? Despite the risk involved with meme-based crypto pairs like Dogecoin, they can still shoot up on positive momentum. However, the market speculates that DOGE cannot reach the $10 level in the foreseeable future. How much is $500 worth of Dogecoin right now? $500 is worth nearly 2,276.57 DOGE in June; however, this amount changes based on day-to-day price fluctuations. Does DOGE have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but looking at DOGE, it’s trading above its average price of the last two years. Currently, the coin is trading below the year’s peak price of $0.414, which was observed on January 17, 2025, but the trend is expected to change, and a positive outbreak can be expected. The DOGE/USD pair is expected to reach the $1.72 mark by 2031, so holding it for longer can be beneficial.

Dogecoin historic price sentiment DOGE price history 2013 was the beginning of Dogecoin, and it surged to $0.0004 in the first days of trading. By March 2014, the coin attempted a breach of $0.001 but failed, closing the year at $0.0001. In the subsequent years, Dogecoin faced immense competition from new coins, including Stellar, Neo, and Monero, which dragged the coin’s price further down. According to the Dogecoin price history, it traded in a strict range of $0.002 to $0.0036 for most of 2019. In January 2021, DOGE saw significant gains, closing the month at $0.037. Subsequently, Dogecoin attained an ATH of $0.7376 on May 8, 2021, but lost 76% of its value, closing the year at $0.1703. In 2022, Dogecoin maintained an average market price of about $0.07. The coin began trading around $0.08 in 2023 and closed the year at $0.08955. In 2024, Dogecoin (DOGE) began consolidating around $0.08, surged above $0.2 during March’s bull run, fluctuated between $0.1011 and $0.1759 through mid-year, spiked to $0.4312 in November, and ended the year at $0.314. In January 2025, DOGE clocked the highest price of $0.41; however, after shedding 38% value, it stepped down to $0.258 in February. In March, DOGE’s value decreased further as it dipped to the $0.20 range, and April saw the lowest DOGE price of $0.142. However, in May, the meme coin recovered back to the $0.249 mark, following some improvement. Near the start of June 2025, Dogecoin is trending near the $0.20 level.",Crypto Price Predictions|DOGE,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|MINING|SPONSORED|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-21 09:45:39

The asset is hovering near $103,700 following a volatile 24-hour stretch, in which it briefly dropped below $103,400 before staging a modest recovery, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. This price behavior reflects an uneasy market backdrop, shaped by both geopolitical tensions and uncertain monetary policy. According to an X post by crypto analytics firm Santiment on Thursday, sentiment among retail investors has turned sharply negative. The firm reported that the ratio of bullish to bearish commentary has fallen to just 1.03 to 1 — the lowest since early April, when the President Donald Trump unveiled his so-called Liberation Day tariffs, triggering peak market fear at the time. Santiment emphasized that this current wave of retail pessimism is unusually intense and, based on past patterns, may mark a contrarian signal for a price rebound. They specifically noted that back in April, Bitcoin rallied shortly after similar fear levels surfaced, suggesting large investors often use periods of retail capitulation to accumulate at favorable prices. Adding to the pressure is the Federal Reserve's recent decision to hold interest rates steady, which has kept btcoin trading in a relatively tight $100,000 to $110,000 range over the past month. Meanwhile, on-chain metrics show declining open interest on Binance, pointing to continued deleveraging among derivatives traders. At the same time, whale wallets have shown steady accumulation since 2023 — an indication that large holders are continuing to build their positions despite the short-term uncertainty. Technical Analysis Highlights BTC-USD traded in a 24-hour range between $106,552.98 and $102,411.01, a 3.89% swing as volatility spiked midday. A sharp drop occurred between 14:00 and 17:00 UTC, pushing price below $104,000 and forming strong resistance near $106,000 on above-average volume. Support emerged between $103,000 and $103,500, where price consolidated on declining volume during the final eight hours of the analysis period. A V-shaped rebound developed late in the session, with BTC rising from $103,363 to $103,618 and establishing a local floor near $103,500. Short-term momentum indicators showed mild recovery as the session closed near intraday highs, but follow-through remained limited.

This isn’t science fiction; it’s a real possibility being explored by the state of Wyoming. The big news hitting the crypto world is that the Wyoming State Stablecoin Commission has identified two prominent blockchains, Solana (SOL) and Aptos (APT), as potential platforms for its forthcoming state stablecoin, dubbed WYST. This development, highlighted by Aptos via a recent announcement on X, signals a significant step forward in state-level adoption of blockchain technology and puts the spotlight firmly on Solana and Aptos as key players in this innovative endeavor. What is the Wyoming Stablecoin Initiative? Wyoming has long positioned itself as a forward-thinking state when it comes to digital assets and blockchain technology. Recognizing the potential benefits of stablecoins, the state established a commission tasked with exploring the feasibility and implementation of a state-issued stablecoin. The primary goal is to create a digital asset that offers the stability of the US dollar while leveraging the efficiency and transparency of blockchain technology. The proposed stablecoin, WYST, would theoretically be backed by liquid, high-quality assets, providing a secure and reliable digital medium of exchange. The idea behind a Wyoming stablecoin isn’t just about having a digital currency; it’s about potentially enhancing financial infrastructure, facilitating faster and cheaper transactions within the state, and attracting blockchain innovation. For a state known for its independent spirit and pro-business stance, exploring a state stablecoin represents a logical extension of its efforts to be a leader in the digital asset space. The commission’s work involves rigorous evaluation of various technological, legal, and economic factors to ensure that WYST, if launched, is robust, compliant, and beneficial for the state’s residents and economy. Why Were Solana and Aptos Selected as Potential Platforms? The selection of Solana and Aptos as top contenders didn’t happen by chance. The commission likely evaluated numerous blockchain protocols based on criteria crucial for issuing and managing a stablecoin at scale. Key factors would include transaction speed, throughput (transactions per second), cost-effectiveness, security, reliability, and the maturity of the ecosystem. Solana has gained prominence for its incredibly high transaction throughput and low transaction costs, often measured in fractions of a cent. Its architecture, particularly its Proof-of-History consensus mechanism combined with Proof-of-Stake, allows it to process thousands of transactions per second, making it highly scalable. For a state stablecoin potentially used for various payments and transfers, speed and low cost are paramount. Solana’s vibrant developer community and growing ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps) also make it an attractive option, suggesting potential for integration into existing or new financial services. Aptos , while newer than Solana, was founded by former Meta (Facebook) employees who worked on the Diem stablecoin project. This pedigree brings significant experience in building scalable, secure blockchain infrastructure specifically designed for handling large volumes of financial transactions. Aptos boasts high theoretical transaction speeds and focuses heavily on safety and reliability through its Move programming language and parallel execution engine. Its design is inherently focused on scalability and future-proofing, which would be critical for a state-level financial instrument. The team’s background in stablecoin development likely gave Aptos a unique edge in the commission’s evaluation. Both blockchains represent the cutting edge of Layer 1 technology, aiming to solve the scalability issues that have plagued earlier blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Their ability to handle a high volume of transactions efficiently and cheaply is a fundamental requirement for a successful blockchain stablecoin that could potentially be used by a large population. Solana vs. Aptos: Which Blockchain Stablecoin is the Better Fit? While both platforms are strong contenders, they have distinct characteristics that the commission would need to weigh carefully. Here’s a simplified comparison: Feature Solana Aptos Maturity More established network and ecosystem. Newer network, rapidly growing ecosystem. Transaction Speed/Throughput Very high, proven in practice (though network stability has been a past concern). High theoretical throughput, designed for scale. Transaction Cost Very low. Very low. Consensus Mechanism Proof-of-History + Proof-of-Stake. Proof-of-Stake (HotStuff variant) + Block-STM (parallel execution). Programming Language Rust. Move (designed for secure asset management). Past Performance/Stability Experienced network outages in the past. Newer, less history of performance under extreme load (but designed to prevent outages). Background Built by Solana Labs, strong focus on speed. Built by former Diem team, strong focus on safety, reliability, and financial use cases. For a Wyoming stablecoin , reliability and security are paramount. Aptos’s origins in the Diem project, which was specifically designed for stablecoins and payments, and its focus on safety through the Move language might give it an edge in certain technical and security considerations. However, Solana’s larger, more mature ecosystem and proven ability to handle immense transaction volumes (despite past stability issues) could make it attractive for immediate implementation and integration with existing blockchain infrastructure. The commission’s decision will likely hinge on a deep dive into the technical resilience, governance models, security audits, and long-term viability of each network for supporting a critical state financial function. The specific requirements for the WYST state stablecoin will ultimately determine which platform aligns best with Wyoming’s vision. What Challenges Lie Ahead for the Wyoming Stablecoin and Its Chosen Blockchain? Even with a potential blockchain platform identified, the path to launching a Wyoming stablecoin is fraught with challenges. These include: Regulatory Hurdles: Navigating the complex landscape of state and potential federal regulations around stablecoins and digital assets. Technical Implementation: Building the necessary infrastructure, smart contracts, and interfaces for issuing, managing, and redeeming WYST. Security and Audits: Ensuring the highest levels of security for the underlying blockchain and the stablecoin contract itself through rigorous audits. Adoption and Integration: Encouraging businesses and residents within Wyoming to use WYST and integrating it with existing financial systems. Asset Backing Management: Establishing a transparent and secure system for managing the reserves that back the stablecoin. Political and Public Perception: Gaining public trust and political support for a novel state-issued digital currency. The commission’s ongoing work involves addressing these challenges head-on. The choice between Solana and Aptos will also depend on which platform offers better tools and support for overcoming these specific hurdles. For instance, the security features of the Move language on Aptos or the battle-tested network operations of Solana might be key differentiating factors. What Does This Mean for Blockchain and State-Level Adoption? Wyoming’s initiative is a potential game-changer. If successful, the WYST state stablecoin could serve as a blueprint for other states considering similar ventures. It validates the potential of blockchain technology, specifically high-throughput chains like Solana and Aptos, for government-backed financial applications. This move could accelerate the conversation around digital currencies at the state level and potentially influence future federal discussions. For Solana and Aptos , being chosen as the platform for a state stablecoin would be a massive endorsement. It would provide significant credibility, attract further development, and potentially lead to increased adoption and network activity. It positions them not just as platforms for decentralized applications but as serious contenders for foundational financial infrastructure. The selection process itself highlights the increasing seriousness with which governmental bodies are evaluating blockchain technology. It moves beyond theoretical discussions to practical considerations of which network can actually handle the demands of a state-backed currency. This is a crucial step towards mainstream institutional adoption. Actionable Insights For Investors: Keep a close eye on developments regarding the Wyoming stablecoin decision. A selection could positively impact the chosen blockchain’s reputation and potentially its market value. For Developers: The requirements for a state stablecoin highlight the need for robust, secure, and scalable blockchain solutions. Building applications that align with these needs could be lucrative. For Policymakers: Wyoming’s approach provides a case study for how states can explore blockchain for financial innovation, emphasizing the need for careful evaluation and consideration of regulatory frameworks. For the Public: Understand that stablecoins are a bridge between traditional finance and digital assets. A state stablecoin aims to offer stability and potentially more efficient transactions. A Pioneering Step for Wyoming and Blockchain Stablecoins The Wyoming State Stablecoin Commission’s identification of Solana and Aptos as potential platforms for its WYST state stablecoin marks a significant milestone. It underscores Wyoming’s commitment to innovation in the digital asset space and highlights the growing recognition of advanced blockchain capabilities. Both Solana and Aptos bring unique strengths to the table, from Solana’s established high throughput to Aptos’s stablecoin-focused design and security features. While challenges remain in the development and implementation of a state-backed digital currency, the fact that a US state is seriously considering these next-generation blockchains for such a critical application is a powerful testament to their potential. The final decision will be a crucial moment, not just for the chosen platform, but for the broader narrative of blockchain technology integrating with traditional governmental and financial systems. This pioneering initiative by Wyoming could pave the way for a new era of state-issued digital currencies built on robust and scalable blockchain foundations.

Nonetheless, we’ve decided to conduct a fun experiment and use the prominent AI-based chatbot ChatGPT to understand when it would be a good time to buy PI within the current market context, of course. The following is a conversation with ChatGPT and its arguments based on the 1-day, 4-hour, and 1-hour price charts. Let’s see how it goes. Defining Expectations and Tuning the AI If you’ve had any experience with ChatGPT, you will know that its data set could be lacking in certain areas. That’s why it’s important to fine tune it if you want more precise answers. First, it’s important to define the role of the bot for the conversation. In our case, we want it to act from the standpoint of a professional analyst and crypto trader, so that’s what we tell it. As soon as we do that, though, you can see some of its problems: Source: ChatGPT As you can see, ChatGPT doesn’t recognize PI as an officially tradeable cryptocurrency and hasn’t yet acknowledged the fact of its mainnet launch, which took place earlier this year. We had to remind it. Source: ChatGPT Okay, we’re finally on the same page. It’s sourcing price information from Binance’s page. Funnily enough, Binance is yet to list PI, if it ever will, but that’s a topic for another discussion . Pi Network Price Analysis: ChatGPT vs. Charts I will provide the images from the TradingView chart and ChatGPT’s answer in one edited frame so that it’s easier to navigate. Starting with the 1-day chart. Daily chart analysis, ChatGPT To summarize, ChatGPT considers PI to be in a strong bearish trend since achieving its all-time high in late February and is currently in a “capitulation to accumulation” phase with key support at $0.50 – $0.52 and “extreme” support at $0.40 – $0.42. Let’s move on to the 4-hour chart. 4-hour chart analysis, ChatGPT The main conclusions from this, according to ChatGPT, are that the support zone is at around $0.52 – $0.53, which it also calls the “critical buy zone,” while the resistance is found at $0.56 – $0.58. And now, let’s move on to the 1-hour time frame. 1-hour chart analysis, ChatGPT The takeaway from this is that the $0.52-$0.53 zone is acting as a “firm base,” while the $0.56 price point is the immediate resistance. Best Time to Buy PI Coin? And now, for the grand finale, let’s see what ChatGPT thinks is the best strategy and when to buy PI coin. Conclusion, ChatGPT As you can see, the primary buy zone is at what the bot identified as the primary support zone – more or less where, the price is currently trading at around $0.52 to $0.53. If you are patient, though, the higher-reward play, although with lower probability is to buy during conditions of extreme capitulation, which would take place if the price hits $0.42 – $0.44. On the other hand, if you are looking for a safer play, you can wait for the price to reclaim the local resistance with volume. It’s found at $0.56. It’s very interesting to see if this analysis will hold any ground. Of course, treat this as nothing but an experiment and keep in mind that none of what you read here is financial advice. This is just the analysis of an AI-based chatbot that had hard times identifying whether or not PI was actually listed on exchanges.

In a notice issued Friday, officials announced that a formal investigation will be conducted in the autumn to evaluate the potential impact of mining operations. The outcome could lead to a temporary halt on such activities, aimed at redirecting resources toward more essential public and industrial needs. The potential ban would be under Norway’s Planning and Building Act, a legislative tool that allows the government to allocate energy usage and infrastructure. “It is uncertain how big a problem crypto mining will become in Norway in the future,” the government said, adding that newly introduced data center regulations requiring registration will help clarify the scope and footprint of crypto-related facilities. Rising Electricity Costs Norwegian households, like many across Europe, have seen a sharp increase in electricity prices over the past two years, largely driven by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent disruption in oil and gas supplies. This has added urgency to national efforts to prioritize energy allocation and limit non-essential power consumption . Local communities have also voiced frustrations over the noise generated by crypto mining farms, with several petitions calling for shutdowns of such operations. While mining may bring in revenue and investment, many argue it offers little social benefit and places an unnecessary burden on already strained infrastructure. Norway to Ban Mining? Norway’s proposal echoes similar moves in other regions. Earlier this year, Russia imposed mining bans across 10 regions to prevent power outages and reduce energy stress. China, once the global leader in Bitcoin mining, implemented a blanket ban in 2021, pushing many miners to relocate to more crypto-friendly jurisdictions like Texas in the United States. Despite ongoing environmental concerns, crypto mining remains legal across most of the U.S., where it continues to contribute significantly to the global Bitcoin hashrate. Lawmakers have raised questions about sustainability, but regulatory action has been sporadic and state-specific. For now, Norway’s move signals a growing shift among European nations toward reevaluating the energy-intensive nature of crypto mining.

One decentralized finance project—Mutuum Finance (MUTM)—is showing signs of long-term strength, despite staying under the mainstream radar. The project has quietly raised over $10.8 million in its ongoing presale, backed not by social media buzz, but by a clearly defined roadmap, real utility, and working mechanisms that will serve both passive and active investors. Unlike TON’s speculative price action, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a robust lending protocol that combines both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) mechanisms, alongside plans to launch its own overcollateralized stablecoin and Layer-2 infrastructure. Investors are taking notice of this fundamentals-first approach, especially as Mutuum moves closer to its beta launch and exchange listings. Layer-2 Speed and Stablecoin Utility Will Transform the Protocol Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is actively developing with Layer-2 integration in mind, ensuring that transactions will remain both fast and affordable even during periods of high network congestion. This enhancement is expected to significantly improve usability compared to older DeFi protocols that often struggle with high fees and slow confirmations. As the platform matures, Layer-2 support will give users a seamless experience when lending, borrowing, or staking mtTokens on-chain. In addition to its lending functionality, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a decentralized, fully overcollateralized stablecoin pegged to $1. This stablecoin will be minted directly when users deposit collateral—such as ETH or BTC—and will be burned when debt is repaid or liquidated. Interest payments on these loans will be directed to Mutuum’s treasury rather than centralized issuers, supporting the project’s self-sustaining model. Unlike traditional stablecoins governed by external market dynamics, Mutuum’s version will rely on protocol-governed interest rates. This algorithmic control will allow the platform to increase or decrease borrowing rates to maintain the $1 peg, ensuring both price stability and systemic health. Only approved issuers will be able to mint the stablecoin, and every issuance will be tightly capped, enforcing responsible growth through transparent, on-chain controls. Arbitrage mechanics will also help maintain the peg. For example, if the stablecoin trades above $1, users will be incentivized to mint and sell at a premium. Conversely, if the price drops below $1, borrowers will buy it at a discount and repay debt, tightening the circulating supply. This self-correcting loop will be key to long-term stablecoin viability, all without requiring fiat backing or custodial trust. Lending, mtTokens, and Real Passive Income—Not Hype At its core, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized lending protocol that allows users to participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. In the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model, users will deposit assets like USDC, ETH, BNB, or AVAX into a shared pool. Interest rates in this system will rise or fall automatically based on pool utilization. Higher usage will increase APY for depositors, drawing in more capital and rewarding participation with real income—unlike staking systems that rely solely on token emissions. Users will receive mtTokens, a tokenized representation of their stake in the pool. These mtTokens will accrue value over time, making it possible to track earnings and even use them as collateral or for staking to earn passive dividends. A portion of the protocol’s revenue will be used to buy back MUTM tokens and distribute them to mtToken stakers, offering a second layer of consistent, protocol-driven rewards. For more active participants, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model will offer customized lending terms. Users will be able to offer or request loans in various tokens—including volatile assets like PEPE, DOGE, or SHIB—on their own terms. This flexibility will give experienced DeFi users the ability to optimize returns or access liquidity on more favorable timelines. The CertiK audit, initiated with a token scan score of 80, adds another layer of credibility to the project. Conducted through both manual review and static analysis, the audit helps verify that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being developed with serious attention to safety and best practices. Combined with its upcoming beta launch, Layer-2 infrastructure, and stablecoin issuance, this level of diligence is creating deep confidence among those following the project’s progress. From $0.03 to a 25x Upside? The Numbers Behind the Growth The presale for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 5, with tokens priced at $0.03 and over $10.8 million already raised from more than 12,250 holders. Investors looking at long-term value are using this entry price to position themselves ahead of key developments like the beta platform release, exchange listings, and the full integration of the stablecoin and Layer-2 capabilities. Let’s break that down with a simple example. A $2,000 investment at the current price of $0.03 secures around 66,666 MUTM tokens. At a future valuation of $0.75—a realistic 25x return—that initial investment would grow to $50,000. Unlike tokens driven by media exposure alone, MUTM’s utility-based framework gives stronger weight to this growth trajectory. The protocol is expected to benefit directly from increased lending activity, and staking participation, all of which feed value back to the token via buybacks and dividends. As part of its roadmap, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is preparing to launch the beta version of its protocol by the time the token lists publicly. Investors participating in the presale will likely enter ahead of this critical milestone, benefiting from early exposure to the platform’s real-world mechanics. The project is also running a $100,000 giveaway campaign to reward its growing community and expand reach in anticipation of wider adoption. For those watching the market closely, now is the time to look beyond momentary pumps and consider the protocols building for scalability, real income, and financial transparency. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is checking every box—and doing it without the noise.

46468633,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=752759,1750500020,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/46468633.jpeg,Reddit might require iris scans for user verification,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/reddit-scanning-orbs-user-verification/,"Social media platform Reddit is reportedly considering using World ID, the verification system based on the iris-scanning Orbs, for its user verification. The company behind the system, Tools for Humanity, was co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. According to a report by Semafor, citing two people familiar with the matter, Reddit could soon deploy World ID as a means for users on its platform to verify that they are unique individuals. The report also suggested that the system would still ensure users remain anonymous if they chose to do so. Reports of talks between representatives of Reddit and Tools for Humanity show the need for new identity verification technologies, as online platforms are being flooded with inauthentic content using artificial intelligence. It is also in line with global governments considering new age verification laws to prevent children and teenagers from accessing social media. If the aim of the partnership is approved, it would signal a good turn for Tools for Humanity. Reddit is in talks to deploy World ID on its platform Tools for Humanity founded World ID six years ago, to provide users with a universal basic income, offering them a digital asset called Worldcoin in exchange for scanning their eyeballs with an Orb. According to reports, when World ID users scan their irises in one of the company’s Orbs, they get free Worldcoins. The token is worth just under a dollar at the time of writing this article. This development also comes off the back of a recent issue involving Reddit and the University of Zurich. According to reports, lawyers representing the social media platform sent formal legal demands to the university whose researchers used AI to impersonate actual users in an experiment carried out to showcase the powers of AI persuasion. In addition, states across the United States are considering new laws that will require internet companies to verify the age of their users. As a result of these developments, there has been renewed urgency to find ways to verify some of the information people give to online platforms while also providing them with adequate privacy and anonymity which has been seen as a characteristic of the web. Last month, Reddit co-founder Steve Huffman said AI and age verification laws could force the firm to check if its users are humans and are of a certain age. Huffman said the company could work with third-party platforms to avoid having to directly collect user information. “Specifically, we will need to know whether you are a human, and in some locations, if you are an adult,” said Huffman. “But we never want to know your name or who you are. The way we will do this is by working with various third-party services that can provide us with the essential information and nothing else.” In response to the update, many users have threatened to boycott the platform. Most users said they would delete their accounts or move to other platforms if Reddit were to adopt the verification system. “Tell me – should I be happy that Reddit may enter the crypto space or sad that they want to verify us users by a method we already declined when [World] was launched?” a Reddit user said. Aside from Reddit users, World’s biometric data collection using its Orbs has also faced pushback from many industry advocates and policymakers. As of May, the project had reported that more than 12 million individuals had scanned their irises using the Orb. World also announced plans to debut in six United States cities in April, including Atlanta, San Francisco, Miami, Nashville, and Austin.

If so, you’ve likely heard the buzz around Real World Assets (RWA) making their way onto the blockchain. A significant development just hit the wires, showcasing tangible progress in this space: the ACRED Fund , a tokenized private credit fund managed by Securitize, has officially surpassed a massive $100 million in assets under management (AUM). What is the ACRED Fund and Why $100M Matters? The Apollo Diversified Credit Fund, or ACRED Fund for short, isn’t your average crypto project. It’s a tokenized fund designed to give eligible investors access to private credit strategies. What makes it stand out is that it’s backed by real-world assets – specifically, a portfolio managed by Apollo, a leading global alternative asset manager. The fund’s shares have been tokenized on the blockchain using the Securitize platform, making them digital securities. Hitting the $100 million AUM mark is more than just a number; it’s a strong signal of growing confidence and adoption. For the nascent world of Tokenized Private Credit and RWA, this milestone demonstrates that institutional and accredited investors are increasingly comfortable leveraging blockchain technology for sophisticated financial products. Demystifying Tokenized Private Credit So, what exactly is Tokenized Private Credit ? Think of private credit as lending provided by non-bank institutions to companies. It’s a huge market, but traditionally illiquid and only accessible to a select few large players. Tokenization changes the game by representing ownership or exposure to these credit assets as digital tokens on a blockchain. Here’s a simple breakdown: Traditional Private Credit: Direct loans, illiquid, high barriers to entry, manual processes. Tokenized Private Credit: Ownership represented by digital tokens, potential for increased liquidity (though depends on the platform/fund structure), potentially lower operational costs, enhanced transparency via blockchain records. This innovation doesn’t fundamentally change the underlying asset (the private credit loan), but it revolutionizes the wrapper around it, offering potential benefits in terms of accessibility, efficiency, and transparency for eligible investors. Securitize: Powering the Digital Asset Revolution Behind the successful tokenization of the ACRED Fund is Securitize , a leading platform for issuing and managing digital securities. Securitize specializes in bringing real-world assets like equity, debt, funds, and real estate onto the blockchain. Their technology handles the complexities of regulatory compliance, investor verification, and the technical aspects of token issuance and management. Securitize’s role is crucial because tokenizing regulated financial products like fund shares requires adherence to strict legal and compliance frameworks. Their platform provides the necessary infrastructure to ensure that the digital tokens representing ACRED shares meet regulatory requirements, making the fund accessible to the target audience of institutional and accredited investors in a compliant manner. Why Institutional Crypto is Embracing RWA The fact that a fund backed by Apollo and tokenized by Securitize is attracting significant AUM highlights a major trend: the increasing convergence of traditional finance and digital assets, often referred to as Institutional Crypto adoption. Institutions aren’t just looking at Bitcoin or Ethereum; they’re exploring how blockchain technology can improve existing financial processes and unlock new investment opportunities. Real World Assets (RWA) on the blockchain offer several compelling advantages for institutions: Potential for Increased Efficiency: Streamlined processes for issuance, transfer, and settlement compared to traditional methods. Enhanced Transparency: Transaction histories recorded on an immutable ledger. Greater Accessibility (for eligible investors): Lower minimums or easier access compared to some traditional private placements. Diversification: Access to asset classes previously difficult to integrate into digital asset portfolios. 24/7 Markets: While trading depends on platform availability, the underlying asset representation exists on a network that operates continuously. The success of the ACRED Fund serves as a prime example of how institutions are moving beyond speculative crypto trading and exploring the practical applications of blockchain for regulated financial products. Benefits of Tokenization for Private Credit Investors For the accredited and institutional investors participating in the ACRED Fund , tokenization offers specific advantages: Digital Ownership: Fund shares are represented as digital tokens, potentially simplifying management and transfer (within compliance limits). Streamlined Operations: Potential for faster settlement and reduced administrative overhead compared to traditional paper-based or legacy systems. Programmability: Tokens can potentially be programmed with compliance rules, automating aspects like transfer restrictions or dividend distributions. Potential for Future Interoperability: As the RWA space grows, tokenized assets could potentially interact with other digital asset protocols and platforms, subject to regulatory approvals. While the primary draw is access to Apollo’s private credit strategy, the tokenized structure provides a modern, efficient wrapper for this traditional asset class. Challenges and the Road Ahead for Tokenized RWA Despite impressive milestones like ACRED’s $100M AUM, the path for Real World Assets (RWA) on the blockchain isn’t without hurdles. Key challenges include: Regulatory Clarity: Navigating different jurisdictions’ rules around digital securities and tokenized assets remains complex. Liquidity: While tokenization offers the *potential* for increased liquidity, secondary markets for private, tokenized assets are still developing. Infrastructure Development: Building robust, secure, and interoperable platforms for issuing, managing, and trading RWA tokens is ongoing. Investor Education: Educating traditional investors about the benefits and risks of tokenized assets is crucial for broader adoption. However, the momentum is clearly building. The success of platforms like Securitize and funds like ACRED demonstrates a clear market demand for these innovative financial products. The future will likely see more diverse RWA, from real estate and intellectual property to carbon credits and fine art, making their way onto the blockchain. Actionable Insights from the ACRED Milestone What can we take away from the ACRED Fund reaching $100M AUM? RWA is Gaining Traction: This isn’t just theoretical anymore. Significant capital is flowing into tokenized real-world assets. Institutional Interest is Real: The primary investors in funds like ACRED are institutions and accredited individuals. This is where serious capital is entering the digital asset space beyond speculative trading. Compliance is Key: The success is tied to platforms like Securitize that prioritize regulatory compliance, essential for attracting traditional finance players. Private Credit is a Strong Use Case: The illiquid nature of traditional private credit makes it a compelling candidate for the efficiency and potential liquidity benefits of tokenization. For those following the space, this milestone underscores the tangible progress being made in bridging traditional finance and blockchain technology through compliant digital asset structures. Conclusion: A New Era for Finance? The ACRED Fund surpassing $100 million in assets under management is a significant moment for the world of digital assets and traditional finance alike. It validates the growing interest in Tokenized Private Credit and highlights the potential of Real World Assets (RWA) on the blockchain. Powered by platforms like Securitize , these innovations are paving the way for increased efficiency, transparency, and accessibility for eligible investors. While challenges remain, the momentum behind Institutional Crypto and asset tokenization is undeniable. Milestones like this demonstrate that the digital transformation of finance is not just coming; it’s already here, building bridges between established markets and the decentralized future.

RUMOR: Whispers from D.C. suggest something massive — U.S. authorities are exploring whether Ripple’s $XRP escrow could be repurposed as part of America’s national financial reserves. Sound far-fetched? So did Bitcoin ETFs once. Strategic digital assets are heating up. XRP… pic.twitter.com/SQsyeo5gBz — Paul White Gold Eagle (@PaulGoldEagle) June 20, 2025 His comment comes amid growing buzz on X, where crypto analysts like John Squire and Pumpius have floated the theory that the U.S. might explore XRP’s utility for reserve backing. While some compare the possibility to the once-unlikely approval of Bitcoin ETFs , Morgan isn’t buying it. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP Prices are Down Today? , Fed Payment Rumors Add Fuel At the same time, new posts have emerged claiming that the U.S. Federal Reserve is already using XRP via its FedNow payment system. One viral post insisted that XRP use is “100% confirmed.” But this appears to stretch the facts. Volante Technologies, a partner in the FedNow pilot, has integrated Ripple tech for cross-border payments. Still, there’s no verified indication that XRP itself is being used by the Fed for transactions. Why Now? These rumors gained more attention following Ripple’s release of 1 billion XRP from escrow in early June. Split across three large transactions, the tokens were valued at over $2.2 billion. Combined with recent discussions around a potential U.S. strategic crypto reserve , including altcoins like XRP and SOL, the speculation has only intensified. Despite XRP’s growing presence in global payments infrastructure, there’s no concrete evidence to support claims of its seizure or inclusion in the U.S. reserve. For now, they remain speculative at best. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche followed similar patterns. The biggest returns always came before exposure, while networks were still small and tokens were still affordable. Bitcoin Solaris is in that phase right now. The presale is live at $8 per token. More than $5 million has already been raised by over 11,500 wallets. The projected listing price is $20 — locking in a 150% gain before a single exchange opens. But the difference here isn’t just timing. It’s function. BTC-S already powers products that reward users daily, with token velocity, live mining, and an expanding reward economy. Daily Rewards, Real Token Flow At the center of the Bitcoin Solaris economy is Nova — the mobile mining app that lets users earn BTC-S directly from their phones. It’s not a wrapped service or outsourced cloud pool. The system measures real usage and distributes token rewards based on device contribution, with no capital lockup or staking period required. Early beta testers out-earned some of the largest staking platforms, all without buying rigs or running wallets 24/7. The app is in active rollout, with more users onboarded as presale expands. BTC-S also moves through the Bitcoin Solaris Casino — an on-chain reward engine that distributes tokens daily. All verified users get one free spin per day, with instant payout chances. Buyers who hit specific spending tiers unlock larger reward pools, including up to 0.5 BTC in bonuses. The spin logic is automated and smart contract-driven — no centralized draw, no delayed credits. These systems keep BTC-S circulating before it even hits public markets. That flow drives demand, creates winners daily, and reinforces the core value loop that’s already running. Presale at $8, Capped Supply, and No Inflation Only 4.2 million BTC-S tokens are available in the presale. The total supply is capped at 21 million — forever. There are no future emissions, no inflation schedules, and no hidden unlocks waiting to dilute value. What’s being sold now is the only public supply until listings. At $8, the token is still priced under 40% of its projected launch value. With active products already distributing BTC-S and more utilities on the way, the price is still trailing the value. Every user participating now is ahead of both the listing and the demand wave that comes with it. The opportunity isn’t just in scarcity — it’s in position. This is the phase where utility already works, but market access hasn’t priced it in yet. Audited, Verified, and Already Covered by Analysts BTC-S isn’t just delivering functionality — it’s doing it transparently. The core contracts have been audited by Cyberscope . The Nova App’s mining logic was independently reviewed by Freshcoins . And the dev team has completed KYC verification to back investor safety. In a recent breakdown, Token Empire called Bitcoin Solaris the only project under $10 where rewards are moving, products are active, and upside hasn’t been locked out. Product Momentum Is Pushing Value Forward BTC-S isn’t sitting in wallets. It’s circulating. Between Nova and the Casino, tokens are moving daily, creating reward loops that continue to grow as new users join in. The next expansion is the Mining Power Marketplace — a live-use platform that lets users monetize unused processing power or rent capacity using BTC-S. The feature is already in development and ties directly into the network’s value cycle. Wallet upgrades, testnet deployment, and developer tools are all scheduled for release this year. These aren’t stretch targets. They’re tracked, funded, and moving forward with presale capital that’s already raised. Bitcoin Solaris isn’t a theory or a bet on potential. It’s a network already distributing tokens, already rewarding users, and still sitting at just $8 per token. The $20 listing target gives new buyers immediate upside. But the real value is in getting in before BTC-S becomes harder to earn — and more expensive to buy.

For those tracking the intersection of technology and market dynamics, particularly within the crypto and AI sectors, the latest news from Character.AI is certainly noteworthy. Character.AI, the popular AI chatbot provider backed by Google and boasting tens of millions of monthly active users, has announced a major leadership change. Stepping into the crucial role of Character.AI CEO is Karandeep Anand, formerly the VP of Business Products at Meta. This appointment comes at a pivotal time for the company, balancing ambitious growth plans with pressing challenges, particularly around user safety. Meet the New Character.AI CEO: Karandeep Anand Karandeep Anand is not entirely new to Character.AI, having previously served as a board adviser. His move to the chief executive position brings a wealth of experience from some of the world’s largest tech companies. Before his tenure as Meta VP , where he oversaw advertising products reaching billions of users, Anand held leadership roles at Microsoft, heading product management for the Azure cloud platform’s user experience. Most recently, he was the president of the fintech startup Brex. This diverse background, spanning large-scale consumer products, enterprise cloud services, and fintech, positions Anand uniquely to navigate Character.AI’s current landscape. His experience at Meta, in particular, dealing with products used by vast numbers of people, could be invaluable as Character.AI scales its platform. Navigating Challenges and Prioritizing AI Safety Anand takes the helm just over 10 months after the departure of co-founder and former CEO Noam Shazeer, who returned to Google. This transition period has seen Character.AI face significant scrutiny, especially regarding user safety. The company is currently involved in a lawsuit alleging a connection between one of its chatbots and a tragic incident involving a teenager. In response to these concerns and the active lawsuit, Character.AI has been implementing new safety features. Addressing AI Safety is clearly a top priority for the new leadership. However, Anand also highlighted a common challenge with safety filters: their tendency to be overly restrictive. In a blog post, Anand stated that one of his immediate priorities would be making safety filters “less overbearing.” While emphasizing the company’s deep commitment to user safety, he acknowledged that filters sometimes block interactions that are “perfectly harmless.” This suggests a focus on refining the balance between protection and user experience. What’s Next for the AI Chatbot Platform? Beyond safety, Karandeep Anand outlined several key areas for improvement and innovation for the AI Chatbot platform. These include: Improving the quality of AI models that power the chatbots. Innovating around memory features, allowing for more coherent and personalized conversations over time. Increasing transparency around decision-making processes within the platform. Anand indicated that many of these features are expected to roll out within the next 60 days, signaling an intent for rapid development under his leadership. Market Context and Regulatory Landscape Character.AI specializes in chatbots designed purely for entertainment, a segment of the generative AI market that has shown surprisingly massive growth. Data from Sensor Tower for 2024 indicates a significant user base, with 66% aged 18-24 and 72% being women. This demographic insight is crucial for understanding the platform’s appeal and tailoring its development. The company’s relationship with Google, including a non-exclusive agreement to use Character.AI’s technology following the former CEO’s move, has also drawn regulatory attention. Federal regulators are investigating the deal over antitrust concerns, placing Character.AI within a broader trend of ‘reverse-acquihire’ deals in the AI space that have faced similar scrutiny. Conclusion: A New Era Under Karandeep Anand Karandeep Anand’s appointment as Character.AI CEO marks a significant moment for the company. Bringing extensive experience from giants like Meta and Microsoft, he steps in to lead the popular AI Chatbot platform through a period of rapid growth, regulatory challenges, and critical AI Safety considerations. His stated priorities – refining safety filters, enhancing AI quality, improving memory, and increasing transparency – suggest a strategic approach focused on both user experience and responsible development. The coming months will reveal how Anand’s leadership shapes the future trajectory of Character.AI in the competitive generative AI market.

Recent technical indicators suggest these major altcoins could be primed for significant upside, catching the attention of traders looking for well-timed entries. Oversold conditions, resistance tests, and strong fundamentals are aligning to hint that these tokens might be preparing for their next leg up. This market spotlight is presented in partnership with Outset PR —crypto’s go-to agency for momentum-aligned storytelling and results-driven visibility. When the charts start moving, Outset PR ensures the narrative does too. XRP Edges Up with Possible Gains on the Horizon Source: tradingview XRP is currently trading between just over $2.05 and $2.30. Its price has seen a minor dip recently, falling by about 2% over the past week and nearly 9% this past month. Looking ahead, XRP could rise to the nearby resistance point of $2.45, which would mean a bump of about 10%. If it pushes further, it might aim for the second resistance level of $2.70, offering possible gains of around 17% from its current range. This crypto shows potential, although it’s just below its short-term trend average, hinting that it might soon break higher. Solana (SOL) Bounces Back: Bullish Hopes Amid Recent Dips Source: tradingview Solana's price is currently experiencing a dip, with values swinging between about $140 and $167. Recently, the coin's value declined by roughly 5.5% over the past week and nearly 15% in the last month. Despite this slump, Solana shows promise for a rebound. If buyers regain momentum, it could challenge the resistance level of $181, a potential climb of over 20% from lower levels. A further leap could drive prices towards the next marker at $209, suggesting an even more significant gain. But watch for immediate support around $127 to see if Solana can find a firm footing for the next upward push.

The claims came after co-founder Jaz Gulati posted a snapshot of Garden’s Dune Analytics dashboard on X, boasting that it had collected $300,000 in fees over 12 days. ZachXBT responded to the post, bashing Garden of supporting Chinese-based laundering operations that helped move funds stolen in the Bybit hack by the Lazarus Group. “ You conveniently left out >80% of your fees came from Chinese launderers moving Lazarus Group funds from the Bybit hack ,” he reckoned. “ Who are you building for again? ” Crypto security analyst questions dashboard data According to the Dune dashboard, as of June 19, Garden Finance had processed 24,984 BTC in total volume, equal to approximately $1.5 billion in USD value, through over 40,000 atomic swaps. The platform’s largest swap to date was 10 BTC, while total reported fees collected stood at 40.11 BTC. Responding to ZachXBT’s claims, Gulati argued that “30 BTC fees came before the hack even happened,” attaching a Discord screenshot dated October 24, 2024, showing roughly 30 BTC in fees. this is great analysis since 30 BTC fees came before the hack even happened pic.twitter.com/C6A5F3BLsd — Jaz 🌸 (@jzgulati) June 21, 2025 The on-chain sleuth noted that he hadn’t even mentioned funds from “other DPRK hacks yet, like WazirX,” bashing the DeFi protocol for failing to flag the hackers’ transactions. Bybit’s hack, which occurred on February 21, 2025, involved a breach of the exchange’s cold wallet. Nearly $1.5 billion in Ethereum was siphoned from user accounts after attackers compromised a developer working on SAFE Wallet, a platform used by Bybit customers, five days ahead of the exploit. Several analysts, including ZachXBT, traced the stolen funds to laundering networks operating through DeFi bridges to the Lazarus Group . Gulati lambasted the blockchain security analyst by saying he was speaking from a point of “misinformation.” ZachXBT then asked : “ Explain how it is ‘decentralized’ when I watched in real time for multiple days as a single entity kept topping up liquidity from Coinbase for the Chinese launderers as they continued moving Bybit funds? ” explain how it is “decentralized” when I watched in real time for multiple days as a single entity kept topping up cbBTC liquidity from Coinbase for the Chinese launderers as they continued moving Bybit funds? — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) June 21, 2025 The developer is yet to respond to the question. Who helped Lazarus in the $230 million WazirX hack? In his accusations against Gulati, ZachXBT talked about the attack on WazirX , an Indian crypto exchange, where the Lazarus Group reportedly stole more than $230 million in crypto. That hack, which took place on July 18, 2024, was executed through forged smart contract signatures used to bypass WazirX’s multisig wallet protections. Hackers drained funds within an hour of gaining access. Similar to the Bybit case, investigators traced the exploit to North Korea’s Lazarus Group. Authorities in Japan, the United States, and South Korea later issued a joint cybersecurity alert identifying similar tactics used across both attacks. The group reportedly used social engineering, phishing, TraderTraitor and AppleJeus malware to target developer workstations and compromise their infrastructure. Crypto stolen in both hacks was subsequently laundered across decentralized platforms, often using mixers to obscure transaction trails. Garden Finance’s dashboard shows there was a spike in Bitcoin swaps between May and June 2025, with individual daily volumes peaking near 90 transactions in wrapped Bitcoin assets. The chart lists swaps by chain-token combinations such as base-cbBTC, ethereum-WBTC, and arbitrum-WBTC, with base-cbBTC recording the highest usage statistics. cbBTC, a wrapped Bitcoin asset pegged to Coinbase BTC, was mentioned by ZachXBT in his attack on Garden Finance, propounding that the platform was party to the untraceable movements of illicit funds from DPRK hackers .

Farina posted that Ripple is actively working with these institutions as they issue central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) on the XRP Ledger. The tweet, which referenced a video of Garlinghouse speaking on the subject, was framed as confirmation that the use of Ripple’s technology in the public sector is not speculative, but already underway. In the attached video, Garlinghouse explained that Ripple is collaborating with multiple central banks worldwide. While some of these relationships have been made public, others remain in testing or experimental phases. He noted that CBDCs are being issued directly on the XRP Ledger, reaffirming the company’s commitment to positioning its infrastructure as a core element in the next generation of digital currencies. “Ripple DOES work with a number of Central Banks and they are issuing their CBDC on the XRP Ledger” @bgarlinghouse It’s not fiction…It’s happening $XRP pic.twitter.com/LAV25dXnYz — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) June 18, 2025 Focus on Infrastructure, Not Token Use Garlinghouse’s remarks did not specifically state whether the XRP token is being utilized in the CBDC implementations, only that the XRP Ledger is the chosen infrastructure. This distinction has been the subject of ongoing discussion in the digital asset space, with many industry participants continuing to scrutinize whether Ripple’s commercial advancements translate into demand for the XRP token itself. Farina’s tweet emphasized that this development is a factual and present reality rather than a projection, pointing to Ripple’s confirmed interactions with central banks and the use of the XRP Ledger in those efforts. The post was framed as further validation of XRP’s strategic positioning in global financial infrastructure. Mixed Reactions from the Online Community The tweet drew responses from digital asset observers offering different perspectives. One user highlighted the fact that central bank adoption of Ripple’s technology demonstrates that XRP is moving beyond speculative narratives and is becoming part of the foundational infrastructure of finance. This view interprets central bank involvement as a milestone in blockchain adoption, with the XRP Ledger gaining ground in institutional circles. Another user, however, expressed skepticism about the implications for the XRP token itself. This response argued that while Ripple’s technology is being adopted, there is no clear indication that the XRP token is directly benefiting. The comment suggested that Ripple may profit from infrastructure deals while the retail XRP market remains unaffected, drawing attention to the ongoing separation between enterprise use of Ripple’s ledger and the utility of its digital asset. Ripple’s Position in the CBDC Landscape The public remarks from Garlinghouse, cited by Edward Farina, reinforce Ripple’s status as a technology partner for central banks exploring digital currency issuance. By positioning the XRP Ledger as a viable foundation for CBDC deployment, Ripple continues to establish itself as a provider of enterprise-grade blockchain infrastructure. Although the degree to which the XRP token is integrated into these efforts remains unclear, the company’s continued expansion into the public sector adds momentum to its long-term strategy of driving adoption across global financial systems.

With institutional adoption on the horizon, the stock has considerable exposure to a new kind of institutional investment cycle, one focused on crypto's payment rails. Trading at only 18x Adjusted EBITDA, (as a run-rate) we think the stock appears quite reasonably priced. We're upgrading COIN to a 'Strong Buy'. Over the last few years, we've put out a number of articles on Coinbase ( COIN ), consistently calling the stock a ' Buy ': Seeking Alpha This is due to the fact that we see the crypto space growing in importance over the next decade, as the ecosystem's overall size, functionality, and accessibility begin to rival the traditional financial system. In the past, part of our bullish thesis has centered around Coinbase’s exposure to Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Bitcoin trading volumes, which have historically made up a large portion of the firm's revenues. It shouldn’t be a surprise, then, that the stock has correlated strongly with Bitcoin's price since IPO: TradingView However, as stablecoin legislation makes its way through US Congress, and we see increased interest from 'traditional' companies in the space, we think the next crypto cycle is already taking shape. In the past, we’ve seen speculative frenzies dominated by meme coins, NFTs, and a fixation on both Bitcoin and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), perhaps to the exclusion of all else. Now, as decentralized finance apps and stablecoins begin to offer the world new payment rails for stable value exchange, we think COIN's services revenue will begin generating a majority of appreciation for shareholders going forward. Over the last few years, Coinbase has done an excellent job at cutting costs and diversifying its revenue base. Now, with the potential for massively increased institutional adoption, we think COIN's non-transaction revenues will power the stock's next leg higher. It’s true that COIN is expensive on some metrics, but when you break it down, we actually think the market is asking a reasonable price from investors. Today , we'll dive into the company's recent results, explain why we think COIN's diversified revenue should bolster margins and growth, and reiterate the case that we think Coinbase is 'one to own' for the years ahead. Sound good? Let’s dive in. Financials Our last coverage of Coinbase was in October of last year, and so before we dive into the recent updates that have reinforced our bullish view, it’s probably worth covering some of the recent numbers, just to get a sense of where the stock currently sits. In Q4 of 2024, Coinbase reported revenues of $2.27 billion, which represented 138% year-over-year growth. Similarly, the company reported earnings per share of ~$4.68, which came in well above analyst estimates. By all counts, this was a strong corner. In Q1 of 2025, results were a bit weaker, with revenue actually down sequentially, although still up 24% YoY. EPS also missed by quite a large margin: Seeking Alpha However, when you zoom out, much of this EPS volatility has to do with the company's 'Fair Value' mark of its crypto holdings. If you look at Coinbase from a cash perspective, the firm appears to be in a much stronger operating position. Once you strip out depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and gains and losses from the crypto portfolio, adjusted EBITDA for Q1 of this year was down only very slightly YoY, from $1.02 billion to $930 million: 10Q This reflects gaining momentum in the company's EBITDA, which has now — for several quarters — earned at roughly a $1 billion run rate. Annualize this, and Coinbase as a firm — subject to some volatility and trading revenues — is producing roughly $4 billion a year in adjusted EBITDA. Not bad! With some stocks, using adjusted EBITDA can be a tricky measure, but given that the majority of Coinbase's adjustments are correcting for crypto portfolio fluctuations, we think it’s actually a relatively fair representation of what’s going on, 'on the ground'. Frankly, when we first started covering the stock back in May 2023, Coinbase was just turning the corner on revenue diversification and cost-cutting. Now, two years on, the firm is pumping out solid, consistent adjusted EBITDA off the back of a diversified revenue base at the center of the regulated crypto ecosystem. We expect the company to continue making gains as institutional adoption increases. Recently, we’ve seen a number of headlines that bolster our view that increased institutional adoption is on the way. This week, the US Senate recently voted for and passed a bill giving much stronger legal footing to the stablecoin market. This is a big deal, especially considering the bill's bipartisan support. Now, with the stroke of a pen, Donald Trump could turn whatever final bill lands on his desk into a cohesive outline for how modern businesses can actually use crypto payment rails and free themselves from oppressive credit card fees. Additionally, as this legislation has advanced, we’ve seen comments from major retailers like Walmart ( WMT ) and Amazon ( AMZN ) that they’re looking into using crypto payment rails and stablecoins to reduce payment friction and increase profitability. CFOs at other companies may begin seeing the potential benefits of using stablecoins, and we expect Coinbase to garner a majority of this business. Revenue-wise, Coinbase is well-prepared to monetize this opportunity. The company is known for its retail and institutional trading platforms and brokerage capability, but COIN's revenue streams have now diversified to the point that in Q1 of this year, 35% of revenue came from stablecoins, blockchain rewards, interest, and subscription revenues from programs like 'Coinbase One': Seeking Alpha As we see it, COIN has numerous levers to grow from both traditional routes and increased institutional crypto adoption, and the stock should move beyond how many currently on Wall Street see it — as an underperforming Bitcoin wrapper. Valuation So, COIN's financials have improved, and we think the firm has considerable upside in the event of increased crypto adoption through its service offerings. Why does the stock look so expensive? In short, by some metrics, COIN is trading at a heightened multiple. You can see this in the stock's price-to-sales ratio, which stands at around 11x: TradingView There’s no doubt that this is high, both relative to the past , and nominally vs. the market . However, if you look at the company, Coinbase sports considerable operating margins—at least once you strip out the net income fluctuations from the crypto portfolio. In Q1, the firm produced $2 billion in revenue and $930 million in adjusted EBITDA. This is a nearly 50% cash margin. Not only that, but COIN is now producing roughly $4 billion in adjusted EBITDA, with a market cap of $75.2 billion. Broken down like this, the stock is actually trading at an 18x multiple. This appears MUCH more reasonable. We would argue that for a company that has so much potential upside, to such a large potential shift in the way this financial system works, paying 18x adjusted EBITDA appears like an incredibly fair price. Again, if you look at Seeking Alpha's valuation grade of Coinbase, you’ll find the stock's multiples look quite high versus the financial sector: Seeking Alpha In fact, the stock earns an 'F' rating. That said, many of these numbers are skewed dramatically by the 'Fair Value' fluctuations. Additionally, the company's lumpy results and uncertain growth catalyst timings make the stock look expensive. If Coinbase manages to continue growing EBITDA into the future, we think a purchase today at under $300 per share could be incredibly advantageous for investors. When you add up COIN's significant leverage to the next potential crypto cycle along with the diversity of revenue sources, high margins, and relatively attractive price point, we think the stock looks like a 'Strong Buy'. Risks Of course, when it comes to Coinbase, there are some risks to consider. First and foremost, many of COIN's revenues come from transaction fees from retail users. These still make up the lion's share of revenue. This means that a protracted lack of interest in the crypto ecosystem would also likely have a negative impact on Coinbase's revenue picture. This is what we saw in 2021. However, management has — as we mentioned — taken steps to reduce reliance on trading revenues, which, we think, makes the stock appear more well-prepared for an inevitable future slowdown. Additionally, many of the assets that trade on Coinbase’s platform remain without a regulatory framework. This presents a considerable regulatory risk for Coinbase. The stablecoin news is welcome but make no mistake — regulatory risk remains as Coinbase continues to offer altcoins that have (frankly) questionable status as securities. Management has done an excellent job navigating the regulatory storm in the past, but we think that’s possible that risks here could flare back up. This would likely ding the stock, at least in the short term. Summary Overall, though, we think COIN is incredibly well-prepared to capitalize on the next crypto cycle in a way that it hasn’t been able to before. With increased exposure to stablecoin revenues, reduced regulatory risk, and continued EBITDA margin strength, we think Coinbase's organic performance has a great trajectory. Coupled with a multiple that we think appears very reasonable, it’s hard to see the stock as anything other than a ' Strong Buy '. Thus, our rating.

For those tracking the pulse of the Crypto Market , understanding such macroeconomic discussions is crucial, as they often provide insights into the potential flow of capital and investor sentiment. Let’s break down Trump’s statement and explore its possible implications for the broader US Economy and digital assets. What Did Trump Say About Interest Rates ? In a post on Truth Social, Donald Trump asserted that if Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell were to lower benchmark Interest Rates to a range of 1% to 2%, the United States government could realize annual savings of up to $1 trillion. This bold claim ties the direct cost of government borrowing to the Fed’s monetary policy decisions. Trump also used the statement as an opportunity to criticize the current administration, attributing what he sees as high costs to the policies enacted under President Biden. His remarks position the lowering of Interest Rates not just as an economic adjustment but as a significant fiscal maneuver with substantial savings potential. How Do the Federal Reserve’s Actions Influence the US Economy ? The Federal Reserve , often referred to as the ‘Fed’, is the central banking system of the United States. Its primary tool for influencing the US Economy is setting the target range for the federal funds rate – the interest rate banks charge each other for overnight borrowing. This rate serves as a benchmark that influences other interest rates throughout the economy, including: Rates on mortgages and car loans Interest earned on savings accounts and bonds Borrowing costs for businesses The cost of government debt When the Fed lowers Interest Rates , it typically aims to stimulate economic activity by making borrowing cheaper, encouraging spending and investment. Conversely, raising rates is intended to cool down an overheating economy and combat inflation by making borrowing more expensive. Trump’s argument centers on the government’s own borrowing costs. The U.S. government issues Treasury bonds and other debt instruments to finance its operations and existing debt. The interest paid on this debt is a significant government expense. Lowering market Interest Rates generally leads to lower yields on newly issued government debt, potentially reducing the government’s annual interest payments, which is the basis for Trump’s $1 trillion savings claim. Could Lower Interest Rates Really Save $1 Trillion? The potential savings figure cited by Trump is substantial and depends on several factors, including the total amount of outstanding government debt, the average maturity of that debt, and the speed at which lower rates would translate into lower borrowing costs for new or refinanced debt. Here’s a simplified look at the concept: The U.S. national debt is currently in the tens of trillions of dollars. A portion of this debt matures regularly and must be refinanced by issuing new debt. If the prevailing Interest Rates are lower when new debt is issued, the interest payments on that new debt will be lower. Over time, as more high-interest debt matures and is replaced by lower-interest debt, the total annual interest expense could decrease significantly. However, reaching a $1 trillion annual saving depends on a rapid and sustained drop in borrowing costs across a vast amount of debt. Economists have varying estimates on the potential savings from lower rates, and $1 trillion is generally considered to be at the higher end of projections, potentially requiring a more significant and prolonged rate reduction than the 1-2% target range mentioned by Trump, or assuming a very rapid turnover of existing debt. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve’s decisions are based on its dual mandate: achieving maximum employment and stable prices (controlling inflation). While the impact on government borrowing costs is a consideration, it is not the primary driver of monetary policy. The Fed must weigh the potential benefits of lower rates (like reduced government interest expense and economic stimulation) against the risks, particularly the risk of fueling inflation, which could ultimately harm the US Economy . What is the Potential Crypto Market Impact? Discussions around Interest Rates and the US Economy are closely watched by participants in the Crypto Market . Here’s why: Risk-On Sentiment: Lower interest rates typically make traditional, safer investments like bonds less attractive due to lower yields. This can encourage investors to seek higher returns in riskier assets, including stocks and cryptocurrencies. This is often referred to as a ‘risk-on’ environment. Liquidity: When the Fed lowers rates or engages in quantitative easing (another monetary tool), it generally increases the overall liquidity in the financial system. More money flowing through the economy can find its way into various asset classes, including crypto. Inflation Hedges: While the Fed’s goal with higher rates has been to combat inflation, some investors view assets like Bitcoin as a potential hedge against currency devaluation, especially if expansive monetary policies (like very low rates) are pursued over long periods. Comparison to Traditional Finance: As interest rates rise, the cost of capital increases for businesses, potentially slowing growth. For speculative assets like many cryptocurrencies, a lower-rate environment can make their potential future value more appealing compared to the lower returns offered elsewhere. If the Federal Reserve were to significantly lower Interest Rates towards the 1-2% range suggested by Trump , many analysts would anticipate this being a bullish signal for the Crypto Market , assuming other economic factors remain stable. Cheaper borrowing could also potentially free up capital for institutional or individual investors to allocate to digital assets. Navigating Economic Statements: Actionable Insights For those involved in the Crypto Market , keeping an eye on macroeconomic indicators and political commentary is important, but it’s crucial to approach them with a critical perspective. Distinguish Policy from Proposal: Trump’s statement is a proposal and a critique, not current Fed policy. The Fed operates independently and makes decisions based on complex economic data, not political directives. Understand the ‘Why’: Consider the context and potential motivations behind political statements on the economy. Focus on Fed Communication: Pay closer attention to official statements and minutes from the Federal Reserve ‘s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings for actual policy direction. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: While a significant shift in Interest Rates could have long-term implications for the Crypto Market , short-term market movements are influenced by a vast array of factors, including regulation, technological developments, and market sentiment specific to crypto. Do Your Own Research: Economic forecasts and the impact of policy are complex and subject to change. Rely on diverse sources of information and conduct thorough research before making investment decisions based on macroeconomic predictions. While the prospect of $1 trillion in savings is a headline-grabbing figure, the path to achieving it through significantly lower Interest Rates involves intricate economic trade-offs that the Federal Reserve must navigate carefully to ensure the long-term health of the US Economy . The reaction of the Crypto Market to any such policy shift would be just one piece of the larger economic puzzle. Summary Donald Trump has put forward the idea that lowering Federal Reserve Interest Rates to 1-2% could save the US Economy $1 trillion annually, while also criticizing current policy. While lower rates can indeed reduce government borrowing costs and historically tend to favor risk-on assets like those in the Crypto Market , the Fed’s decisions are driven by broader economic mandates like employment and inflation control. The potential savings figure is significant but depends on many variables. For crypto enthusiasts, this serves as a reminder that macroeconomic policy is a key factor to monitor, but official Fed actions and a comprehensive understanding of economic dynamics are more reliable indicators than political statements alone.

Backed by strong technical setups and growing community interest, these lesser-known tokens may be poised to lead the next wave of breakout performers. This future-focused analysis is brought to you by Outset PR —the crypto-native agency that helps early-stage and overlooked projects get the visibility they deserve. With data-driven media strategies and real-time trend alignment, Outset PR turns rising potential into headline performance. Sei (SEI) Shows Promise Despite Recent Dips Source: tradingview The cryptocurrency Sei (SEI) is currently priced between 16 and 20 cents, facing resistance at approximately 23 cents. It has a support level near 15 cents. Recently, Sei saw a weekly rise of over 11%, suggesting it might push toward 23 cents soon. Although it has dipped by almost 10% over the past month and around 52% over six months, the 100-day moving average and recent indicators show potential recovery. If Sei breaks the 23 cents barrier, it could target the next level at 26 cents, a gain of up to 30% from current levels. The relative strength and momentum indicators suggest potential stabilization and growth ahead. Pi Network (PI) Shows Signs of Potential Rebound Amid Recent Slump Source: CoinMarketCap The Pi Network coin is currently trading between forty-five and seventy cents, facing a notable drop over the past month. Despite this, it holds potential for growth. If the coin manages to breach the resistance at closer to eighty cents, it might aim for the next level around a dollar and nickel. This could mean an increase of more than forty percent from its current range. However, with its simple moving averages hovering in the mid-fifty cents and its relative strength index near fifty-five, it indicates a stable momentum. While recent trends show declines, the coin has room to rise, especially if market conditions become favorable.

According to CoinGlass , the business saw $458.61 million liquidated in the past 24 hours alone. Ethereum was the hardest hit, accounting for $170.78 million in liquidations, out of which $157.03 million from long positions and $13.75 million from shorts. This highlights growing uncertainty and volatility, leaving traders on the cliff and ETH’s short-term price unclear. However, this ETH price analysis is derived to clear all the mist. Exchange Inflows Spike: On-chain data from Santiment paints a bearish picture. ETH is flowing into centralized exchanges at an unusually high rate, far outpacing outflows. This surge typically signals that holders are preparing to sell, which aligns with the liquidation wave that just hit Ethereum. The magnitude of these inflows implies panic selling or aggressive profit-taking. It is to take note that such behavioral shifts often come before further downward pressure unless reversed by strong buying interest. Until exchange inflows taper off, Ethereum’s price is likely to remain under intense selling pressure. This metric suggests a short-term bearish sentiment dominating the market, demanding caution from ETH bulls. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis: At the time of press, Ethereum is changing hands at $2,444.01, down 4.15% over the past 24 hours. However, the sharp 44.75% increase in trading volume to $20.99 billion indicates significant activity, likely driven by liquidation-triggered volatility. From a technical standpoint, ETH’s RSI is at 40.29, hovering just above the oversold territory, which may suggest a short-term bounce. Supporting this, the 4-hour chart shows ETH rebounded off the lower Bollinger Band at $2,371, forming a bullish hammer-like candle, which signals buyer support at lower levels. However, still, ETH remains under the 20-period SMA, reflecting bearish momentum. For a recovery, bulls must reclaim the $2,495 resistance. If this level fails to hold, ETH could again test the $2,400 support zone. Read our Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030 for long-term targets! FAQs Why is Ethereum’s price dropping today? Ethereum’s price dip is primarily driven by increased liquidations and heavy inflows to exchanges. Is it a good time to buy ETH now? Caution is advised to traders, while ETH shows signs of short-term buyer support, technicals remain bearish, and exchange inflows are high, hinting at more volatility ahead.

The updated prediction was posted on Twitter on June 20, 2025. Analysts attribute their fresh perspective to better cooperation between the SEC and ETF applicants. More Altcoin ETF Approvals Widely Anticipated as Well Other than SOL, LTC, and XRP, Seyffart and Balchunas forecast 90% likelihood of approval for other altcoin ETFs in 2025, including Dogecoin, Cardano, Avalanche, Hedera, and Polkadot. They also foresee a 95% approbation probability for crypto index ETFs submitted by Grayscale, Hashdex, Bitwise, and Franklin Templeton. A number of them are nearing end SEC deadlines in early July. SEC Engagement Signifies Shift in Regulatory Strategy Seyffart pointed out that the greater odds are the product of overt engagement by the SEC, an indicator regulators will probably view most altcoins commodities. The existence of Commodity Futures Trading Commission-regulated markets for the assets also supports the argument. “The timing of these approvals is less clear,” Seyffart went on. Decisions may be coming in weeks or closer to final deadlines in October or November. Analysts: It’s a Matter of When, Not If Despite the timing doubt, analysts both think the approvals are inevitable. “It’s when, not if,” they stated, suggesting altcoin ETF launches could hugely amplify exposure to the wider crypto market in 2025.",Altcoins|Sticky,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|LTC|REGULATION|SOL|XRP,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-06-21 11:25:49

One such project now gaining major traction is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is being aggressively picked up by early adopters as a candidate for the best crypto to buy in 2025. Early buyers will get a preset profit of 100% ROI with the token going live at $0.06. In a summer where market watchers are constantly asking what crypto to invest in now or which altcoins could 10x by next year, Mutuum Finance is emerging as a clear standout, especially for those looking to diversify beyond Bitcoin’s large-cap orbit. Bitcoin Market Update: Institutional Backing Fuels $110K Recovery Bitcoin is currently trading at $105,474, having dipped from intraday highs near $107,199 before finding support above $103,597. Over the past week, robust inflows into spot BTC‑ETFs, exceeding $1 billion, have helped anchor price action above the $100K level amid geopolitical uncertainty and macroeconomic headwinds. Technical indicators show continued bullish momentum, with resistance looming between $110K–$112K; a breakout past this zone could open the door to $115K or higher, although a pullback toward $100K–$102.5K remains a possible short-term scenario. For now, Bitcoin is consolidating near the psychologically and technically significant $105K–$107K range. Amid these developments, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quietly gaining attention. Presale Hype Surges, Mutuum Finance Hits $10.9M Raised Mutuum Finance is exploding in popularity. With its innovative two-way lending model, this DeFi powerhouse has already attracted over 12,300 investors and raised $10.9 million, and it’s not slowing down. The MUTM token price is set to jump to $0.035 in Phase 6, marking a 16.67% surge, meaning those who get in now are positioned for major gains. Early adopters are locking in profits. Mutuum Finance Lending: Smarter, Simpler, Decentralized Mutuum Finance combines both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending, giving users reliable returns from USDT pools via the P2C model and full control of direct crypto transactions via the P2P model. Mutuum Finance’s USD-Pegged Stablecoin Mutuum Finance’s upcoming overcollateralized USD-pegged stablecoin, launching on Ethereum, is designed to maintain price stability and avoid the pitfalls that have been seen with algorithmic stablecoins. With the project already audited by CertiK, Mutuum Finance is laying the groundwork for massive adoption, and those paying attention now could reap the biggest rewards later. In addition, the platform is running a massive $100,000 giveaway , where 10 lucky winners will receive $10,000 each in Mutuum Finance tokens. As Bitcoin eyes a return to $110,000, savvy investors are looking beyond the majors for outsized gains, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is leading that charge. With over $10.9 million raised and a growing base of 12,300+ investors, the project’s presale is accelerating fast. Priced at $0.03 in Phase 5 and set to launch at $0.06, buyers today are positioned for 100% returns before the token even hits the open market. Add in a Certik audit, a dual-model lending platform, a USD-pegged stablecoin, and a $100,000 giveaway, and it’s clear why Mutuum is being called the best new altcoin to buy now.

33767162,[object Object],1750505436,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,XRP Profit-Taking From 300% Green Whales Has Paused—But For How Long?,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-profit-taking-300-green-whales-paused-how-long/,"On-chain data shows the XRP investors with more than 300% in profits took part in a significant amount of selling earlier in the month. XRP Whales With Over 300% Gains Are Calm For Now In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about the trend in the Realized Profit for a specific part of the Bitcoin network. The “ Realized Profit ” refers to a metric that measures, as its name already implies, the total amount of profit that the BTC investors as a whole are realizing through their selling. The indicator works by going through the transaction history of each token being sold on the blockchain to see what price it was moved at prior to this. If this previous selling price for any coin is less than the spot price that it’s now being sold at, then that particular token’s sale is leading to a realization of some net profit equal to the difference between the two values. The Realized Profit takes this difference for all profit-taking transactions and calculates their total sum to determine the situation for the network as a whole. Another indicator known as the Realized Loss tracks the sales of the opposite type. In the context of the current topic, the Realized Loss for the entire market isn’t of interest, but rather that of only a very specific portion of it: the XRP investors carrying gains of more than 300%. The only holders who would be in a profit of this level are those that bought the cryptocurrency prior to the asset’s explosion in November 2024. Thus, the Realized Profit of the cohort tells us about the level of profit-taking that these early buyers are participating in. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the indicator over the last couple of years: As displayed in the above graph, the XRP Realized Profit associated with investors carrying a profit margin of more than 300% saw a very sharp spike just after the initial price rally. This suggests that many of these early buyers didn’t wait too much to harvest their gains. Profit-taking from the group continued in early parts of 2025, although the spikes that the indicator witnessed were of a significantly smaller scale. After March, though, selling from these investors finally calmed down. From the chart, it’s apparent that this calm continued until this month, but the cohort ended up breaking its silence. “In early June, they began realizing profits at a pace of $68.8M per day (7D-SMA), signaling a wave of distribution by early holders,” notes Glassnode. So far since this selling spree, things have calmed down for the XRP Realized Profit of the cohort once more, but considering that these holders have taken part in selling on a few occasions already, it’s uncertain whether this means selling pressure has become exhausted or not. XRP Price XRP has faced a drop of more than 2% in the last 24 hours that has brought its price back to the $2.1 level.",XRP|XRP Profit Taking|XRP Profits|XRP Whales|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|CFX|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-06-21 11:30:36

While the post was vague and lacked verifiable detail, it prompted immediate attention and skepticism from XRP holders and legal experts alike. Bale’s Bold Claim Sparks Buzz Bale’s post read: “So I met my guy from BlackRock in NYC for a coffee. He gave me 2 new XRP dates to watch. Adoption is coming.” Though not the first time the influencer has made such insinuations, this latest statement comes at a sensitive time for XRP, with heightened expectations surrounding institutional interest and regulatory clarity. The reference to “two new XRP dates” sparked a flurry of speculation among retail investors, many of whom remain hopeful that financial giants like BlackRock could eventually integrate XRP into their digital asset strategies. However, Bale offered no evidence, context, or timeline, fueling doubt about the authenticity of his claim. Only after he swore you to the code of silence surely? https://t.co/rVk43Rrw4F — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) June 21, 2025 Bill Morgan Responds with Sarcasm Legal expert Bill Morgan, widely respected in the XRP community for his grounded analysis of the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit, swiftly weighed in on the post. In a sardonic response, Morgan wrote, “Only after he swore you to the code of silence, surely?”—a pointed jab at the cryptic nature of Bale’s message. Morgan’s reply wasn’t merely humorous; it highlighted a recurring issue in crypto circles—unsubstantiated claims from influencers that lack transparency or factual grounding. As someone who has consistently advocated for legal accuracy over hype, Morgan’s tone reflected the increasing frustration among informed XRP supporters. Community Reactions: Support for Morgan, Scrutiny for Bale The XRP community, often dubbed the “XRP Army” reacted swiftly, with many praising Morgan’s stance. One user, xrp-dan, noted: “He’s posted this a few times.” Morgan, in agreement, replied: “Few too many times,” signaling a broader concern over repetitive, baseless claims. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Another user, Mars0634, applauded Morgan for calling out misinformation, saying: “Brilliant Bill pulling up the many lies posted on X about XRP by these so-called influencers. Love it, keep it up.” Meanwhile, Guy Schiefelbein offered a more neutral perspective: “Arr you got to give it to Bale for being consistent.” The overall sentiment leaned toward skepticism, with many users reinforcing the need for credible updates rather than recycled promises. No Evidence of BlackRock Involvement with XRP Despite Bale’s assertion, there is no public record or official statement linking BlackRock to any direct interest in XRP. While BlackRock has explored tokenization, launched a Bitcoin ETF, and shown broader interest in digital assets, it has not announced any XRP-specific initiatives. In the absence of concrete evidence, such speculative posts serve only to inflate expectations and mislead new investors. Ripple vs. SEC: The Real Dates to Watch As XRP’s price and adoption outlook remain closely tied to regulatory outcomes, the most significant dates for the community right now lie within the courtroom. A decision on the final remedies, potentially including fines and injunctive relief, is expected soon. This outcome may directly affect Ripple’s business operations and the standing of XRP in the U.S. market. Until then, legal clarity, not influencer speculation, remains the most reliable signal for XRP’s institutional trajectory.

46472481,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=171092,1750505451,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/46472481.jpeg,Breakthrough: US SEC Approval Odds for Crypto ETFs Soar to 90%,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-approval-crypto-etf/,"BitcoinWorld Breakthrough: US SEC Approval Odds for Crypto ETFs Soar to 90% Hey crypto enthusiasts! Get ready for some potentially game-changing news that could significantly impact the market and your investment strategies. According to leading analysts at Bloomberg, the likelihood of the US SEC giving the green light to a wave of pending crypto ETF applications has dramatically increased. We’re talking about odds soaring to 90% or even higher for most filings! Why Are SEC Approval Odds Suddenly So High? This isn’t just a random guess; it’s based on observations of the regulatory landscape and, importantly, the nature of recent interactions between the applicants and the regulatory body. Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas, well-respected voices in the ETF space, are the ones who’ve raised the bar on their predictions. James Seyffart took to social media platform X to share his updated outlook, explicitly stating that the odds for approval have been elevated to ‘90% or higher’. The key reason cited for this significant jump? Positive engagement from the agency. This suggests that the discussions between the SEC staff and the firms applying for these ETFs are constructive and moving towards resolution rather than facing roadblocks or outright rejection. Think about it: the SEC is known for its cautious, often stringent, approach to new financial products, especially those tied to the volatile and evolving world of cryptocurrencies. Positive engagement indicates they are actively working through the details, asking pertinent questions, and potentially guiding applicants towards structures that meet regulatory requirements. This is a stark contrast to previous periods where applications often languished or were met with skepticism. This shift in dynamic is likely influenced by several factors, including the precedent set by the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year. That landmark decision created a pathway and perhaps a template for how similar products tied to other digital assets might be structured and approved. What Does High Crypto ETF Approval Probability Mean for Your Investment ? The potential approval of multiple crypto ETF s is a massive deal for the cryptocurrency market and for investors, both big and small. Here’s a breakdown of what it could signify: Increased Accessibility: ETFs trade on traditional stock exchanges, making it incredibly easy for everyday investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies without needing to navigate complex crypto exchanges, digital wallets, or private keys. If you can buy a stock, you can buy a crypto ETF. Institutional Flow: This is perhaps the most significant impact. Many large financial institutions, wealth managers, and retirement funds are restricted from directly holding cryptocurrencies due to regulatory or internal policy reasons. An ETF provides a regulated, familiar wrapper that allows these massive pools of capital to enter the market. This influx of institutional investment could provide significant liquidity and drive market capitalization higher. Market Legitimacy: SEC approval lends a significant layer of legitimacy to the underlying assets. It signals that these cryptocurrencies are mature enough and the market infrastructure around them is robust enough to warrant a regulated investment product. This can help build confidence among hesitant investors. Diversification Opportunities: While Bitcoin ETFs are already here, approvals for ETFs tied to other major cryptocurrencies could offer investors easier ways to diversify their digital asset holdings within a traditional brokerage account. Potential Price Impact: While never guaranteed, increased demand stemming from easier access and institutional investment could put upward pressure on the prices of the underlying cryptocurrencies represented in the approved ETFs. For many, a crypto ETF represents a simpler, more secure way to participate in the growth of the digital asset space compared to direct ownership, especially for those new to crypto. Focus on XRP ETF s: Prospects Brighten One specific area of interest mentioned in the analyst’s commentary is the inclusion of applications tied to XRP. The legal status of XRP has been a significant point of discussion and regulatory uncertainty following the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple. However, favorable court rulings in that case have seemingly opened the door for regulated products around XRP. The fact that analysts are now including XRP ETF applications within the high-probability group (90%+) is notable. It suggests that the SEC’s positive engagement extends to assets like XRP, where the regulatory path has been more complex. An approved XRP ETF would be a major milestone for the XRP ecosystem, potentially boosting its profile and making it accessible to a much wider range of investors through traditional brokerage platforms. This development underscores how regulatory clarity, even if hard-fought, can pave the way for mainstream financial products and increased investment opportunities. The Role of the US SEC in Shaping the Future The US SEC plays a crucial gatekeeping role in the traditional financial markets. Their decisions on which products are allowed to be offered to the public have a profound impact on market structure, liquidity, and investor access. For years, the SEC expressed concerns about market manipulation, investor protection, and the nascent nature of the crypto market, leading to delays and rejections of earlier ETF proposals. The shift towards positive engagement and high approval odds indicates that the SEC may be becoming more comfortable with the infrastructure and surveillance capabilities surrounding certain digital assets. It also reflects the persistent demand from the financial industry and investors for regulated crypto exposure. While the SEC’s primary mandate is investor protection, denying access to regulated products like ETFs can, ironically, push investors towards less regulated or offshore platforms. Approving ETFs for various cryptocurrencies provides investors with a familiar, regulated avenue overseen by the SEC itself. Navigating the Investment Landscape: What’s Next? With high approval odds for numerous crypto ETF s, including potential XRP ETF s, investors should start considering how these new products might fit into their portfolios. Here are a few points to ponder: Research the Underlying Asset: An ETF tracks the price of an asset. Understand the cryptocurrency the ETF is based on, its use case, technology, and market dynamics. Understand ETF Mechanics: While simpler than direct crypto ownership, understand how the specific ETF works, its fees (expense ratio), and how it tracks the underlying asset (physically backed vs. futures-based, though most current applications are for spot ETFs). Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Even within a regulated ETF wrapper, cryptocurrencies are volatile assets. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on official SEC announcements and the launch dates of any approved ETFs. This potential wave of approvals represents a maturation of the crypto market and its increasing integration into the traditional financial system. It opens up new avenues for investment that were previously unavailable to many. Is There an Outlier? The Case of the SUI ETF While the outlook is overwhelmingly positive for most applications, the analysts did highlight one exception: the SUI ETF proposed by Canary. According to Seyffart, the odds for the SUI ETF stand at a lower 60%. Why the lower probability for SUI? The analyst points to two main reasons: regulatory uncertainty specifically around SUI and a lack of regulated futures contracts for the asset. Established futures markets for an asset often provide regulators with a level of comfort regarding price discovery, liquidity, and surveillance capabilities. For newer or less established assets like SUI, these elements may not be as developed, presenting additional hurdles for SEC approval of a spot ETF. This serves as a reminder that while the door is opening wide, the SEC will still evaluate each application based on the specifics of the underlying asset and the market infrastructure surrounding it. Not every crypto asset may be deemed ready for a regulated ETF wrapper just yet. Conclusion: A Bullish Signal for Crypto The significantly increased probability of US SEC approval for a broad range of crypto ETF s, including those focused on XRP, is undoubtedly a major positive signal for the entire digital asset ecosystem. It reflects growing regulatory comfort, increasing market maturity, and persistent investor demand. While challenges remain, particularly for newer assets like SUI, the overall trend suggests that accessing cryptocurrency investment through traditional, regulated avenues is becoming a reality for a much larger audience. This could pave the way for substantial new capital flows and further integration of crypto into the global financial landscape, offering exciting new investment opportunities.

46472644,https://timestabloid.com/?p=72089,1750505673,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,SHIB Price If Shiba Inu Market Cap Matches Elon Musk’s Net Worth,https://timestabloid.com/shib-price-if-shiba-inu-market-cap-matches-elon-musks-net-worth/,"The value of one Shiba Inu (SHIB) token could rise substantially if the cryptocurrency’s market capitalization ever equaled Elon Musk’s net worth. While this scenario is entirely speculative, it provides a useful framework for gauging the potential upside of SHIB within the broader meme coin ecosystem. Musk, who has made headlines for his influence on digital assets such as Bitcoin and Dogecoin, has never directly supported Shiba Inu. However, interest from his followers and the SHIB community remains persistent. Elon Musk’s Influence and SHIB’s Position Elon Musk has played a significant role in the price movements of various cryptocurrencies, most notably Dogecoin. His public endorsements and social media activity have previously helped Dogecoin reach record highs. Musk was also linked to brief rallies in other meme coins such as Floki, which gained attention largely because it shares the name of his pet dog. However, he has never promoted Shiba Inu, the second-largest meme cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Although Shiba Inu shares the meme coin category with Dogecoin and Floki, it has not received the same treatment from Musk. Despite repeated attempts from the SHIB community to attract his interest, the billionaire has largely stayed silent on the token. These efforts have included posts from Shiba Inu’s lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, who tried to engage Musk with references to a “Strategic Hub for Innovation in Blockchain (S.H.I.B)” and even commented on one of Musk’s images using “SHIB” as a caption. Estimating SHIB Price Based on Musk’s Wealth Forbes currently estimates Elon Musk’s net worth at $409 billion, making him the wealthiest individual in the world despite recent financial setbacks. This figure is significantly larger than Shiba Inu’s current market capitalization of approximately $6.84 billion. With SHIB trading at $0.00001161 and a circulating supply of 589.25 trillion tokens, the token would need a massive increase in market cap to match Musk’s wealth. If SHIB’s total market value equaled Elon Musk’s net worth, the price per token would rise to about $0.0006940. This would represent an over 5,870% increase from the current price. Achieving this valuation would elevate SHIB to one of the top positions in the cryptocurrency market, surpassing several major assets in the process, assuming other market capitalizations remain the same. Is a $0.0006940 SHIB Price Feasible? While the notion of SHIB reaching a price of $0.0006941 may seem speculative, there are projections within the crypto space that consider it a future possibility. Community figure Davie Satoshi once stated that SHIB would “never crash to zero” and forecasted that the token would increase 30 times in value, reaching $0.0006753 by year-end. Long-term predictions also suggest a slow climb toward this valuation. For example, crypto exchange Changelly believes SHIB could test $0.0006 by 2034, with the $0.00069 level potentially being reached that September. Similarly, analytics platform Telegaon projects SHIB will average $0.000646 in 2030, which aligns closely with the target derived from Musk’s net worth. Although there is no indication that Elon Musk will support Shiba Inu or that SHIB will soon match his net worth in market value, such a hypothetical scenario provides insight into the token’s growth potential. A price of $0.0006941 per SHIB would not only reflect a major leap from current levels but also position the token among the most valuable cryptocurrencies globally.

Bollinger Bands are narrowing, hinting at a potential breakout. RSI at 44.5 suggests mild bearish pressure but also a chance for reversal. According to our Ethereum short-term price prediction, if ETH reclaims the 20-day SMA at $2,563, it could target $2,750. However, a drop below $2,357 may drag it to $2,200. For June 2025, ETH is likely to range between $2,400 and $2,600 , with a bullish bias on reclaiming key levels. High Price : $2,750 Low Price : $2,200 Average Price : $2,450 Ethereum Price Prediction 2025 Ethereum price has been trading in a symmetric triangle pattern since early 2021, a breakout could lead to the ETH coin price smashing the $5k mark and hitting a new all-time high of $5,925. Conversely, rising uncertainty or any unfavorable global economic events could pull the ETH price toward its annual low of $2,917. That being said, it could average out at around $3,392.

As institutions increasingly look to engage with this space, a critical need has emerged for clear, standardized ways to evaluate projects. Enter Web3SOC , a groundbreaking initiative designed to tackle just that challenge. What is the Web3SOC Framework and Who is Behind It? At its core, Web3SOC is a newly introduced framework aiming to provide a standardized method for assessing and organizing DeFi projects. Think of it as a common language and checklist for understanding the health and reliability of a decentralized protocol. This isn’t a solo effort. A powerful consortium of DeFi developers and Web3 security platforms has joined forces to launch Web3SOC. Key players include: Uniswap Labs: A major force in the DeFi space, known for its leading decentralized exchange protocol. Morpho Maple Finance Kiln Steakhouse Financial Cantina (Web3 security platform) Secureum (Web3 security platform) The collaboration between prominent DeFi projects and security experts highlights the dual focus of Web3SOC: operational assessment alongside robust Web3 security considerations. Why is Standardized DeFi Assessment Crucial? For the longest time, evaluating DeFi projects has been a bit like the wild west. Different projects have varying levels of transparency, documentation, and approaches to crucial areas like security and governance. This lack of standardization makes it difficult, and risky, for larger entities – particularly traditional financial institutions – to confidently interact with DeFi protocols. Standardized DeFi assessment provides: Clarity: A common set of criteria makes it easier to compare different projects objectively. Trust: A rigorous assessment process builds confidence in the reliability and security of a protocol. Efficiency: Institutions can streamline their due diligence processes instead of reinventing the wheel for every project. This framework is explicitly designed to pave the way for increased institutional DeFi engagement by providing the structured information and assurance they require. How Does Web3SOC Help Prepare for Institutional DeFi? The Web3SOC framework isn’t just for external evaluators; it’s also a powerful self-assessment tool for DeFi teams themselves. By using the framework internally, projects can identify potential gaps and areas for improvement before they even approach institutions. According to a blog post detailing the initiative, Web3SOC helps institutions assess DeFi organizations across several key areas: Assessment Area What it Covers Governance How decisions are made, voting mechanisms, power distribution, transparency of processes. Security Smart contract audits, operational security, key management, incident response plans. Financial Stability Protocol economics, treasury management, solvency, risk management practices. Regulatory Alignment Understanding and addressing relevant legal and compliance considerations. For a DeFi project looking to attract institutional capital or partnerships, demonstrating a strong showing across these areas using a recognized framework like Web3SOC could become essential. What are the Benefits of Adopting Web3SOC? The benefits of a standardized DeFi assessment framework like Web3SOC are multifold: For Institutions: Reduced risk through standardized evaluation, clearer understanding of protocol operations and security posture, faster due diligence, and increased confidence in the DeFi ecosystem. This is a direct pathway to scaling institutional DeFi participation. For DeFi Projects: A clear roadmap for improving internal processes, enhanced credibility when engaging with institutions, ability to benchmark against industry standards, and potentially attracting more sophisticated users and capital. It helps projects bolster their Web3 security and operational resilience. For the Ecosystem: Increased transparency, fostering trust, promoting best practices, and ultimately accelerating the maturation and adoption of decentralized finance on a larger scale. What’s Next for Web3SOC? The launch of Web3SOC marks a significant step, but it’s likely just the beginning. The framework will need widespread adoption and refinement over time. The collaborative nature of its founding group, including influential players like Uniswap Labs , suggests a strong potential for it to become an industry standard. The success of Web3SOC will depend on ongoing community input, evolution of the framework to adapt to the fast-changing DeFi landscape, and consistent application by both projects and evaluators. Conclusion: A Step Towards Maturing DeFi The introduction of the Web3SOC framework by a consortium including major players like Uniswap Labs is a clear signal that the decentralized finance space is maturing. By providing a standardized approach to DeFi assessment covering crucial areas like governance, security, and financial health, Web3SOC aims to build trust and clarity. This initiative is a vital step in bridging the gap between innovative DeFi protocols and the stringent requirements of institutional DeFi , ultimately contributing to the broader adoption and stability of Web3 security and decentralized technologies.

According to the company, the June 12 exploit was carried out by a “sophisticated cybercrime group” using advanced social engineering tactics. Per a Friday press statement , the company asserted that it initiated its cybersecurity response protocols after detecting suspicious activity within its US network. Though ransomware was not deployed, Aflac admitted that an unauthorized actor had entered its systems through deceptive social manipulation. “ We regret that this incident occurred. We will be working to keep our stakeholders informed as we learn more and continue investigating the incident ,” Aflac stated. Insurance company suffers in ‘month of hacks’ The breach adds to a list of cyber intrusions on insurance firms this month. Earlier in June, Erie Insurance and Philadelphia Insurance Companies also disclosed cyberattacks on their networks. In its statement, Aflac claimed the incident “was part of a cybercrime campaign against the insurance industry.” The company insists that once the breach was detected, the intrusion was halted within hours, and core operations were unaffected. “ We continue to serve our customers as we respond to this incident and can underwrite policies, review claims, and otherwise service our customers as usual, ” Aflac wrote on Friday The insurance company did not name the attackers, but cybersecurity analysts believe the breach may be linked to Scattered Spider, a notorious group of hackers known for targeting US corporations. The group gained authorities’ attention in 2023 after taking part in high-profile attacks on MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment in Las Vegas. Scattered Spider, believed to include young hackers based in the United States and the United Kingdom, reportedly uses rapid, aggressive tactics and advanced deception. According to a forthcoming report from cybersecurity firm Halcyon, the group often registers domain names that resemble legitimate IT support sites. They use the webpages to impersonate internal help desks and trick employees into granting them access. “ They can execute their full attacks in hours. Most other ransomware groups take days ,” explained former FBI Deputy Assistant Director Cynthia Kaiser, who oversaw investigations into the group. She now works at Halcyon and continues to track the group’s activities. John Hultquist, chief analyst at Google’s Threat Intelligence Group, supports Kaiser’s sentiment. “ While people focus on state actors like Iran, the threat I lose sleep over is Scattered Spider ,” he said. “ They are already taking food off shelves and freezing businesses .” The 60 Minutes program on CBS News recently showed how hackers have broadened their targets to include municipalities, hospitals, hotels, and major corporations. In one example, last year’s cyberattack on UnitedHealth Group, reportedly executed by a group called ALPHV, cost providers an estimated $100 million per day in damages. Aflac moves on to customer support and recovery After discovering there was a breach, Aflac said it engaged top-tier third-party cybersecurity operators to lead the investigation. The company said it is currently reviewing files that may have been affected and is reaching out to impacted customers. “ The potentially affected files contain claims information, health information, social security numbers, and/or other personal information, related to customers, beneficiaries, employees, agents, and other individuals in our US business ,” the statement read. Aflac is also offering free credit monitoring, identity theft protection, and Medical Shield coverage for the next 24 months. The company promised its clients that the findings will be transparent and that it will continue to share updates as the investigation progresses.

The fourth presale phase of Ozak AI token (OZ) costs only $0.005. Thus far, the project has collected more than 1.2 million USD in presale contributions from early adopters who believe in the real-world usefulness of AI and its tokenomics. Having a total and maximum supply of 10 billion OZ and no supply circulating at all, the platform stands in a position to grow significantly in the future. Recent projections have indicated a potential that early adopters can get returns of more than 50,000 percent. Optimism Among Investors Over the Low Entry Price of Ozak AI The fourth phase of Ozak AI presale is underway, and the token is offered at a low price point of 0.005. This has helped drive the participation of huge numbers of participants in the initial stages of this presale. The project will have a much lower entry barrier to retail and institutional investors as compared to many other AI crypto projects going live at a higher price. The presale will be held in several rounds, where the prices of each round will be higher. Such a structure is beneficial to early adopters, who trust the project roadmap and plan to scale. The low cost of the current level allows expecting the high returns of the sum invested, at least in the case of the Ozak AI achieving mainstream success after the launch. Over $1.2 Million Raised Reflects Strong Market Demand Ozak AI has already raised more than 1.2 million dollars during the presale campaign, which indicates that it is likely to attract the attention of the crypto community. This magnitude of financial support proves to be particularly remarkable considering that the project is not far advanced. Its total supply limit of 10 billion OZ has never been touched, and supports scarcity and allows the people who have bought it early to have exclusive access. Confidence among investors has been compounded by the fact that the presale is transparent and that it is increasingly gaining coverage in the media, and the narrative is very positive. Its $1 million giveaway is also a noteworthy event that is gaining investor interest in the project investment. Also, a mix of issues of AI and blockchain quantum adopted in the project attracts a large number of supporters interested in innovation-based properties. All these conditions cause the presale of Ozak AI to become one of the most closely followed in the AI crypto niche. Projections of 50,000% Returns Create Euphoria in Cryptoverse The main difference between Ozak AI and a lot of other projects still in growth stages is its opportunity to make a profit. As per recent estimates, market projections, and speculations, early investors may gain up to 50,000 per cent in case Ozak AI hits its projected value after launching. This number is heating up crypto-related chats and social networks. Although it is important to exercise caution when estimating such ROIs, these are not the first of their kind in the context of the crypto ecosystem, particularly when the latter had a narrative, a good technology, and a following. Once all of the promises made by Ozak AI are fulfilled, the current price of OZ tokens of $0.005 will become a life-changing profit to those who were there at the start. Supply scarcity may also contribute to the price movement when the token is listed on exchanges, since there are no tokens trading yet, and the demand has seen an increase at different stages of the presale. These few months may be decisive since the project is planning to transform hype into a success in the long run.

Investor Frenzy Sends Bitcoin Treasury Play into Overdrive Nakamoto Holdings, a rising Bitcoin treasury firm led by U.S. President Trump’s crypto advisor David Bailey, has raised $51.5 million via a PIPE (private investment in public equity) round. The deal was confirmed by merger partner KindlyMD and priced at $5.00 per share, completed in under 72 hours. “Investor interest in Nakamoto is exceptionally high,” said Bailey . “We’re staying focused on raising capital to buy as much Bitcoin as possible.” This latest round brings KindlyMD’s total funding to $563 million, and with convertible notes, the merged entity now commands $763 million in capital—setting the stage for Nakamoto’s aggressive BTC buying spree. Building a Bitcoin Treasury Powerhouse Nakamoto Holdings aims to rival giants like MicroStrategy and Europe’s Blockchain Group, which recently added $20 million in Bitcoin to its $170 million stash. The newly raised funds will primarily go toward Bitcoin acquisitions, with the remainder covering business operations. The move aligns with Nakamoto’s pending merger with Nasdaq-listed KindlyMD, set to close in Q3 2025. Merger Unlocks Bitcoin-Native Financial Innovation Following shareholder approval last month, KindlyMD’s merger with Nakamoto will give rise to a Bitcoin-focused financial entity—designed to build Bitcoin-native businesses through equity, debt instruments, and strategic investments. The momentum comes as 27 companies added BTC to their balance sheets, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET—signaling a wave of corporate Bitcoin adoption . .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Demand Momentum Shows Bears Are Giving Up – Price Reversal Ahead? , Risks Remain in a Volatile Market Despite the bullish narrative, not all analysts are convinced.

Decisions made by institutions like the Federal Reserve directly influence market sentiment, liquidity, and investor behavior. Recently, comments from a key Fed official have provided insights into the potential direction of monetary policy , offering a glimpse into what the rest of the year might hold. What Did Mary Daly Say About an Interest Rate Cut? During a June 20 interview with CNBC, San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President Mary Daly shared her perspective on the timing of potential adjustments to the benchmark interest rate. Her remarks centered on the delicate balance the Fed is trying to strike between controlling inflation and maintaining economic stability. According to Daly, a significant takeaway from her comments was the likelihood of an interest rate cut occurring in the fall, *unless* there is a notable and sustained weakening in the labor market . This condition is crucial, as the Fed’s dual mandate includes both achieving maximum employment and maintaining price stability. Furthermore, Daly expressed a preference to postpone any definitive rate decisions until the economic effects of recently implemented tariffs become clearer. Tariffs can impact inflation (by increasing import costs) and economic growth (by affecting trade), complicating the Fed’s economic forecasts and policy responses. Why Does the Labor Market Hold Such Weight for the Fed? The health of the labor market is a primary indicator the Federal Reserve uses to gauge the overall strength of the economy and potential inflationary pressures. A strong labor market, characterized by low unemployment and rising wages, can fuel consumer spending and contribute to inflation. Conversely, a weakening labor market, with increasing layoffs and stagnant wages, can signal slowing economic activity and potentially ease inflationary pressures. Here’s why the labor market is so critical: Employment Mandate: The Fed is tasked with promoting maximum employment. Significant job losses would push them towards stimulating the economy, often through lower interest rates. Wage Growth & Inflation: Strong wage growth is often passed on to consumers through higher prices, contributing to inflation. Monitoring wage trends helps the Fed predict future price movements. Consumer Confidence: A secure job market boosts consumer confidence, encouraging spending, which is a major driver of economic growth. Therefore, Daly’s emphasis on the labor market underscores the Fed’s data-dependent approach. They are looking for concrete evidence of economic shifts before committing to a policy change like an interest rate cut . How Does Monetary Policy Influence Cryptocurrency? Understanding the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy is vital for anyone involved in cryptocurrency. While not directly controlled by central banks, crypto markets are significantly influenced by macro-economic conditions and liquidity. Here’s the connection: Interest Rates and Risk Assets: Generally, lower interest rates make traditional savings accounts and bonds less attractive. This can encourage investors to seek higher returns in riskier assets, such as stocks and cryptocurrencies. A potential interest rate cut in the fall could theoretically increase appetite for crypto. Liquidity: When the Fed lowers rates or implements other easing measures, it increases the money supply (liquidity) in the financial system. More liquidity can flow into various asset classes, including crypto. Economic Sentiment: The Fed’s outlook on the economy, reflected in their policy decisions and forward guidance, shapes overall market sentiment. Positive signals about growth or controlled inflation can boost confidence in risk assets. Conversely, concerns about a weakening labor market could lead to broader market sell-offs, impacting crypto. Mary Daly’s comments, therefore, aren’t just abstract economic talk; they are potential signals about future liquidity conditions and risk appetite that could directly or indirectly affect the value of your digital assets. What Challenges and Uncertainties Lie Ahead? While Mary Daly’s remarks offer a potential timeline for an interest rate cut , they also highlight the significant uncertainties the Federal Reserve faces: Labor Market Trajectory: Will the labor market remain resilient, or will it show the ‘notable and lasting decline’ that would alter the Fed’s plans? Recent data has been mixed, making the outlook cloudy. Tariff Impact: The full effects of tariffs on inflation and supply chains take time to materialize. Waiting for clarity adds a layer of complexity to economic forecasting. Inflation Persistence: Although inflation has cooled from its peak, it remains above the Fed’s 2% target. The Fed must be confident that easing monetary policy won’t reignite price pressures. Global Factors: Geopolitical events and economic conditions in other major economies can also influence the US economy and the Fed’s decisions. These factors mean that while a fall cut is ‘likely’ under certain conditions, it is by no means guaranteed. The Fed remains data-dependent, and incoming economic reports between now and the fall will be critical. Actionable Insights for Crypto Holders Given the potential influence of monetary policy on crypto markets, what can you do? Stay Informed: Pay close attention to statements from Federal Reserve officials and read summaries of FOMC meetings. Understand their current economic outlook and priorities. Monitor Key Data: Keep an eye on major economic indicators, especially those related to the labor market (e.g., jobs reports, unemployment rate, wage growth) and inflation (e.g., CPI, PCE). Understand Sensitivity: Recognize that cryptocurrency markets can be highly sensitive to changes in liquidity expectations and risk sentiment driven by Fed actions. Diversify and Manage Risk: Don’t place all your investment hopes on a single macro event like an interest rate cut . Maintain a diversified portfolio and have a clear risk management strategy. While predicting exact market movements based on Fed signals is impossible, being informed allows you to better understand the potential forces at play. Summary: Navigating Fed Signals and Crypto Markets San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly’s recent comments suggest that a fall interest rate cut is a plausible scenario, contingent on the labor market not showing significant deterioration and gaining clarity on tariff impacts. This potential shift in monetary policy is highly relevant for cryptocurrency investors, as lower rates can influence liquidity and risk appetite in financial markets. However, the path forward is filled with uncertainty, driven by evolving economic data and external factors. The Federal Reserve’s decisions will remain data-dependent, making it crucial for market participants to stay informed about key economic indicators and central bank communications. Understanding these macro-economic dynamics is key to navigating the interconnected world of traditional finance and digital assets.

With over $10 million raised from thousands of buyers across the globe, this high-momentum project is attracting top-tier investor attention and positioning itself as the next breakout success of the year. Momentum is surging by the day as more buyers race to join what analysts are calling one of the most strategic early entries of 2025 . MAGACOIN FINANCE’s combination of limited supply, politically charged branding , and a fully audited smart contract has created a powerful wave of interest that is only accelerating. Projections for early buyers are nothing short of massive. With leading analysts forecasting between 25x and 30x upside , and some estimates placing the token at a +18,500% ROI , the opportunity is turning heads across both meme coin and broader altcoin circles. Why MAGACOINFINANCE Is the Talk Among Smart Money Shiba Inu has long held attention thanks to its loyal base and growing development around Shibarium. However, even with 30 trillion SHIB tokens accumulated by mid-term holders in recent weeks, price movement remains capped. Forecasts suggest 1.5x to 3x returns in the near term — a strong signal of stability, but far from the hyper-growth targets now surrounding MAGACOIN FINANCE. Dogecoin, while still one of the most recognized names in crypto, is showing limited evolution. With no major upgrades and few technical catalysts on the horizon, its projected gains sit around 1.2x to 2x based on market cycles and speculative ETF rumors. In contrast, MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing real traction , fueled by organic demand and growing global reach. It has already become a magnet for early entries — not only from meme coin fans but also from broader altcoin investors hunting for high-upside, low-entry opportunities ahead of major listings. MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly rising as the boldest and most strategic opportunity in 2025. With unmatched investor momentum, global interest spiking, and projections of up to 18,500% ROI, it is setting the tone for what could be the year’s most explosive crypto story.

At the time of writing, BTC trades around $103,829, down over 2% in the last 24 hours. With 24-hour volume surging to $46.6 billion, volatility has returned, but price action remains indecisive. On the 2-hour chart, Bitcoin is trapped beneath a descending trendline and has failed to hold the 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $104,657. A bearish engulfing candle near the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement at $104,028 was quickly followed by a drop to the $103,000 range. MACD momentum has turned negative, with widening divergence between signal and MACD lines, suggesting a deepening selloff. Key Technical Levels: Resistance: $104,657 (EMA), $105,238 (Fib 0.5) Support: $103,000, then $102,499 and $101,437 MACD: Bearish crossover confirmed A bearish Bitcoin price prediction could occur if BTC closes below $103K with high volume, potentially leading to further declines toward $100,451. Semler’s 105K Bitcoin Bet Shows Institutional Confidence While short-term price action remains cautious, institutional confidence in Bitcoin appears to be strengthening. Semler Scientific announced plans to expand its Bitcoin holdings from 4,449 to 105,000 by 2027, and appointed BTC strategist Joe Burnett to oversee the effort. BIG MOVE: Semler Scientific is going all-in on $BTC , planning to boost its holdings from 3,808 to a whopping 105,000 BTC by 2027! They aim for 10,000 BTC by year-end and 42,000 by 2026. With a 287% yield, they’re riding the corporate Bitcoin wave! #Bitcoin #Crypto — ChainGPT AI Agent (@ChainGPTAI) June 20, 2025 Even amid Friday’s broader crypto pullback, Semler’s stock jumped 14%, underscoring investor enthusiasm for long-term accumulation strategies. According to the firm, their goal is to hold 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025, setting the tone for more corporate treasuries to follow. Although BTC remained largely unmoved by the announcement, these longer-term signals of demand may lay the groundwork for future price stability above $100,000. Regulation Looms as Fraud Spurs ATM Crackdown And then there was the Bitcoin ATM news in Texas where a sheriff took $32,000 from a crypto machine to help recover $25,000 stolen in a government impersonation scam. The story went viral, and now everyone’s talking about whether this will lead to stricter regulations on Bitcoin ATMs. Jasper County sheriff recovers $32K from Bitcoin ATM after local scam, sparking debate over crypto privacy and enforcement methods. #BitcoinATM #LawEnforcement https://t.co/iqtiwD9xZH — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 20, 2025 In 2024 alone, crypto ATM fraud has resulted in $246 million in losses. While this doesn’t mean Bitcoin is the problem, tighter oversight could limit retail crypto access and slow down transaction volume for a bit. At the macro level, Fed Governor Christopher Waller said interest rate cuts could come as early as July if labor markets get weaker. Lower rates are good for risk assets like Bitcoin, but so far, BTC is waiting for more confirmation.

Court Jails 15 Chinese, 2 Filipinos, 1 Pakistani for Cyberterrorism, Internet Fraud in Lagos The Lagos Zonal Directorate 1 of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, on Thursday June 19 and Friday, June 20, 2025, secured the conviction and sentence of 15 Chinese,… pic.twitter.com/3Kf0IeYmfp — EFCC Nigeria (@officialEFCC) June 20, 2025 Nigerian court arraigns suspects for internet fraud The suspects were arraigned separately by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission ( EFCC ), before Justice Ayokunle Faji, Justice Chukwujekwu Aneke, and Justin Yellim Bogoro. During the proceedings, the EFCC legal counsel team, led by Bilkisu Buhari-Bala, Banjo Temitope, and Chineye Okezie, informed the justices that the defendants already entered into plea bargain agreements, which were filed on June 20. Upon the arraignment, the defendants pleaded guilty and confirmed that they voluntarily consented to the plea bargain. Following the development, the court convicted and sentenced each of the suspects to one year in prison and a fine of one million naira (approximately $645). The court also ordered that after the completion of their prison terms, the Comptroller-General of the Nigerian Immigration Service (NIS) should ensure that each of them is deported to their home countries within seven days. The one-count charge in court read that convicts in December 2024, “willfully accessed computer systems organized to destabilize and destroy the fundamental economic and social structure of Nigeria by recruiting Nigerian youths to commit identity theft and impersonate foreign nationals for financial gain”. The offense is punishable under Section 18 of the Cybercrimes (Prohibition, Prevention, etc.) Act, 2015 (as amended in 2024), and Section 2(3)(d) of the Terrorism (Prevention, Prohibition) Act, 2022. According to the EFCC, the suspects were apprehended on December 10, 2024, after a surprise operation at their hideout in Victoria Island. During the media briefing, the Lagos Zonal Directorate of the Commission, Ola Olukoyede said the suspects used the building as a headquarters to lure and train their Nigerian accomplices on how to carry out romance scams and other related criminal activities. “Their Nigerian accomplices were recruited by the foreign kingpins to prospect for victims online through phishing, targeting mostly Americans, Canadians, Mexicans, and several others from European countries,” he said. Giving a detailed look into their operation, the EFCC Chairman said that they provided their Nigerian accomplices with WhatsApp accounts linked to foreign telephone numbers. He said they used the numbers to engage their victims in romantic conversations before pitching their phantom business and investment discussions to trick the victim into shopping at their online platform called yooto.com, “For those who show interest, activation fees for an account on the platform start from $35. According to investigations, the group recruited young Nigerians according to their proficiency in the use of computers, especially typing skills. Those who pass are given computers or other mobile devices and are taken through two weeks of induction on how to impersonate foreign females in romance scam chat. They also tricked their victims into investing in their employers’ crypto investment websites . The chairman added that once the Nigerians can gain the trust of their victims, the foreigners take over the chat and carry out the defrauding, blocking the Nigerians from the transactions.

DOGE is 73% down from its 2024 high. BONK and PEPE maintained a consistent pattern with DOGE in 2025. The memecoin market has been under sustained bearish pressure for most of 2025, with leading tokens including Dogecoin (DOGE), Bonk (BONK), and Pepe (PEPE) all showing significant pullbacks from their recent highs. Nevertheless, core memecoin supporters believe in the future of this class of digital assets, and most consider the falling prices an opportunity to accumulate more volumes of digital assets for potential profits. Dogecoin (DOGE): The Market Leader’s Retracement Dogecoin is the “Bitcoin” of the memecoin ecosystem. It is the pioneer memecoin and the most established among the lot by market capitalization. Such leadership status confers an air of sentimental stability on Dogecoin. Hence, many crypto users believe a resurgence in the memecoin sector will begin with DOGE. In the meantime, DOGE traded for $0.1625 at the time of writing, reflecting a 73% drop from a 2024 high that it achieved seven months ago.

With SOL shedding over a quarter of its value since May and its broader network indicators sharply deteriorating, the sell-off highlights how speculative mania around meme tokens has bled into Solana’s fundamentals. Still, technical signals offer a glimmer of optimism—if buyers return soon. Solana dropped to $140, its lowest level since April 22, erasing over $22 billion in value as the market capitalization fell from $96 billion on May 23 to $74 billion. SOL’s retreat has coincided with the recent dive of Solana meme coins, which have erased billions of value. CoinGecko data shows that these meme coins have a market capitalization of $9.29 billion, down from over $30 billion in January to $15 billion in May. In the past seven days, most Solana meme coins have dived by double digits. Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ) has dropped by 25% in this period, while Popcat ( POPCAT ) and Gigachad ( GIGA ) have fallen by over 20%.

For example, DeFi Llama data show that the transaction volume in its decentralized exchange protocols has dropped to $46 billion in June, down from $97 billion in May and $262 billion in January. Meanwhile, Solana’s stablecoin network has deteriorated this month. Artemis data shows that the stablecoin transaction volume has dropped by over 68% in the last 30 days to $179.5 billion. The number of stablecoin transactions has plunged by 37%, while addresses have fallen by 20% to 3.2 million. SOL price analysis as a bullish flag forms Solana price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that Solana price has tumbled from $187 in May to $140 today, June 21. The 50-day and 100-day moving averages have formed a mini death cross pattern, often leading to more downside. It has also dropped below the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement, while the Relative Strength Index and the MACD have pointed downwards, suggesting further retreat. On the positive side, Solana has formed a bullish flag pattern, consisting of a vertical line and a descending channel. Therefore, there is hope that SOL price will bounce back in the next few weeks. Such a rebound will be confirmed if it rises above the 100-day moving average at $156, which coincides with the upper side of the flag channel.

The RSI near 40.12 hints at the lack of strong momentum for a recovery. It is worth mentioning that a breakout above $170 could trigger a rally toward the $185 to $190 resistance zone. However, a failure to hold above $150 may floor the price to $140. That being said, Solana crypto is likely to trade sideways with an inclination to the bulls until the next fortnight. Potential High: $190 Average Price Range: $165 Potential Low: $140 Solana Price Prediction 2025 As per CoinGlass , Solana leads the derivatives market with $6.56B in open interest, far surpassing other altcoins. The heatmap and high trader positioning signal elevated volatility ahead. Any major price move in SOL could trigger significant market reactions, making it a key token to watch in the coming sessions. If the market favors the bulls, the Solana coin price could breach its current all-time high and head toward a new high of $400. Conversely, stricter regulations or a network congestion setback could pull the price toward its annual low of $250. Considering the present market sentiment, the SOL crypto could settle with an average trading price of around $325.

Let’s dive into some exciting news straight from the Bitcoin market. We’re talking about a significant metric that’s been making waves: Bitcoin open interest . This figure has recently hit a staggering $96 billion, a level that has analysts buzzing about what could be next for the Bitcoin price . Understanding open interest is key to grasping market sentiment and potential future movements. It represents the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, such as futures or options, that have not yet been settled. A rising open interest, especially when paired with a rising price, is often seen as a bullish signal, indicating fresh money entering the market and increased conviction among traders. What’s Driving This Record Bitcoin Open Interest? According to insights shared by Cointelegraph and data from Glassnode, a major catalyst behind this surge is the introduction of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. These exchange-traded funds have opened up a new avenue for both institutional and retail investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. This influx of capital into the ecosystem naturally translates to higher activity in related derivatives markets, pushing open interest figures to new heights. Think of it this way: as more large players and traditional investors enter the space via ETFs, they often use derivatives for hedging, speculation, or complex trading strategies. This increased participation adds to the total number of open contracts, inflating the overall open interest number we’re seeing today. Exploring the Realized Cap Leverage Ratio Beyond just the raw open interest number, another crucial metric is the realized cap leverage ratio. Glassnode data indicates this ratio has climbed to 10.2%. Now, what does that mean in plain English? The realized cap leverage ratio compares the total open interest to the realized capitalization of Bitcoin. Realized cap values each Bitcoin at the price it was last moved on-chain. It’s often seen as a more accurate measure of the network’s true value held by long-term holders compared to market capitalization, which uses the current price for all coins. A higher realized cap leverage ratio suggests that the amount of capital tied up in derivatives is significant relative to the underlying ‘realized’ value of Bitcoin held by investors. The current level of 10.2% places it in the top 10.8% of trading days since 2018. This historical context is important – it tells us that while not unprecedented, the current level of leverage in the system is relatively high compared to most periods over the last six years. Why Does High Leverage Matter for the Bitcoin Price? High crypto leverage can be a double-edged sword: Bullish Potential: When the market is moving upwards, high leverage amplifies gains. Traders with leveraged long positions profit significantly from small price increases, potentially adding fuel to the rally as positions stay open or are added to. The large pool of open interest can act as potential buying pressure if these leveraged long positions are confident and maintain their exposure. Increased Risk: This is where the other edge cuts. High leverage means positions are more sensitive to price swings. A sudden downturn can quickly lead to margin calls and forced liquidations. The Shadow of Liquidation Risk While high open interest and leverage can certainly boost upside potential for the Bitcoin price , they also significantly heighten the risk of cascading liquidations. This is a critical challenge to consider in the current market environment. Here’s how liquidation risk works: Traders open leveraged positions (e.g., betting on the price going up using borrowed funds). If the price moves against their position (e.g., starts to fall), their margin (collateral) can become insufficient to cover potential losses. Exchanges automatically close these positions to prevent losses exceeding the margin. This forced selling is a ‘liquidation’. A large number of liquidations happening rapidly can create a domino effect, pushing the price down further, triggering more liquidations, and leading to sharp, rapid declines – often called a ‘long squeeze’ if it’s primarily leveraged long positions being closed. Given the current high leverage levels, the market is arguably more susceptible to such a cascade event. A relatively modest price drop could potentially trigger a wave of selling pressure from forced liquidations, accelerating the decline. Putting It All Together: What Does This Mean for the Market? The surge in Bitcoin open interest to $96 billion, supported by the structural shift brought by Bitcoin ETFs and reflected in a high realized cap leverage ratio, paints a complex picture for the Bitcoin market . Key Insights: Increased Market Participation: The high open interest signals strong engagement from traders, likely fueled by new capital entering through ETFs. Potential for Volatility: The high leverage means that while upward movements could be amplified, the risk of sharp downward corrections due to liquidations is also elevated. Historical Context: While leverage is high relative to recent years, it’s important to compare it to previous market cycle peaks. Are we at levels seen just before major corrections, or is this a new paradigm driven by institutional entry? This requires careful analysis. Bullish Fuel vs. Bearish Trigger: The large pool of open contracts can act as potential buying power on dips or add momentum to rallies. However, it simultaneously represents a large pool of potentially vulnerable positions that could trigger a sell-off if the market turns. Actionable Insights: Manage Risk: Traders using leverage should be acutely aware of the increased liquidation risk . Setting stop-losses and managing position sizes are more critical than ever. Monitor Funding Rates: Positive funding rates in perpetual futures often indicate a bias towards long positions, which can increase the risk of a long squeeze if sentiment shifts. Watch for Price Catalysts: Given the coiled spring nature of a highly leveraged market, positive or negative news events could have amplified effects on the Bitcoin price . Long-Term View: For investors with a longer time horizon, short-term volatility driven by leverage might present buying opportunities, but understanding the potential for sharp drops is crucial. Comparing Leverage Levels: Is This Unprecedented? While the 10.2% realized cap leverage ratio is in the top 10.8% of trading days since 2018, it’s worth looking at historical peaks to gauge the potential impact. Previous periods of extremely high leverage have sometimes preceded significant price corrections. However, the market structure has also evolved significantly with the advent of spot ETFs and increased institutional participation. This makes direct comparisons challenging, but the historical data serves as a warning about the inherent risks of high leverage in any market. A table illustrating historical leverage peaks vs. current levels could be useful here, though creating a precise, dynamic table without live data is difficult. Conceptually, imagine columns for ‘Date’, ‘Realized Cap Leverage Ratio’, and ‘Subsequent Price Action (e.g., % change in next 30 days)’. This would visually highlight the correlation between high leverage and potential volatility. The Role of Bitcoin ETFs in Shaping Open Interest The launch of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs didn’t just bring new direct investment; it also integrated Bitcoin more deeply into traditional financial structures. This integration often involves the use of derivatives for various purposes, including: Hedging: Institutions holding physical Bitcoin (or equivalents via ETFs) might use futures or options to hedge against potential price drops. Arbitrage: Traders might exploit small price differences between the spot ETF price and futures prices using leveraged positions. Structured Products: The creation of more complex financial products built around Bitcoin can also contribute to derivative activity and open interest. This structural change suggests that a higher baseline of Bitcoin open interest might be the new normal compared to pre-ETF days, but the risks associated with high leverage still apply. Concluding Thoughts: Navigating the Leveraged Landscape The current state of Bitcoin open interest , sitting near record highs at $96 billion and accompanied by elevated crypto leverage , presents a fascinating and potentially volatile market scenario. The bullish narrative is strong, fueled by continued ETF inflows and positive sentiment, suggesting the potential for further upward movement in the Bitcoin price . However, the significant level of leverage simultaneously introduces substantial liquidation risk . A sudden market shock could trigger a rapid unwinding of positions, leading to a sharp price decline. For participants in the Bitcoin market , this environment demands careful attention to risk management. While the potential rewards are significant if the market continues its upward trajectory, the potential for rapid downside moves should not be underestimated. Keeping a close eye on market structure, funding rates, and overall sentiment is crucial for navigating this highly leveraged landscape successfully.

Specifically, on June 20, BlackRock’s spot Ethereum ETF (ETHA) saw an outflow of $19.7 million, the first after 30 days of continuous inflows. This was also the biggest single-day outflow among all Ethereum ETFs, leading to a net market outflow of $11.3 million. Grayscale helped to balance this with an inflow of $6.6 million. 6/20 BlackRock ETH ETF $ETHA net flow -8,140 ETH ($-19.71 million) (FIRST OUTFLOW IN LAST 30 TRADING DAYS, SINCE MAY 7TH) Volume traded: $0.4 billion https://t.co/MS4ZPOhPR1 pic.twitter.com/S5t8q3k7lI — Trader T (@thepfund) June 21, 2025 Despite this drop, BlackRock still leads the Ethereum ETF market, with over $5.2 billion in total inflows since the fund launched. This recent action contrasts with ETHA’s earlier strong performance, which included days with inflows over $100 million. So far, Ethereum ETFs have raised about $9.5 billion, with BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale leading the charge. The outflow from BlackRock may point to short-term caution from institutional investors. This comes as the cryptocurrency market experiences more volatility due to ongoing geopolitical issues in the Middle East.

In fact, the crypto exchange routinely transacts between $2 billion and $3 billion in Tether daily. This volume accounts for over 65% of all USDT transfers on Tron, far outpacing the combined activity of all other exchanges. Binance: Key Driver of Tron-Based USDT Activity According to the latest data shared by CryptoQuant, on average, Binance moves $1 billion more USDT on Tron each day than its competitors. This highlights its role as a central liquidity provider for global traders, institutions, and market makers. The Tron network has become the preferred blockchain for large-scale stablecoin transactions due to its low fees and fast settlement times. This efficiency makes it especially attractive for high-frequency traders and institutions moving large volumes of USDT, particularly on Binance. As a result, Tron now serves as a critical backbone for USDT flows. Meanwhile, Binance’s dominance in this space has broader implications for the market. Its stablecoin activity often is indicative of a shifting sentiment, as large USDT transfers point to potential capital rotation into altcoins, derivatives, or Bitcoin. This concentration of liquidity also presents both risk and opportunity, as per the crypto analytic platform. Whales Power Tron’s USDT Boom As for Tron, the network recently set a new record for USDT stablecoin transfers, which reached $691 billion in volume. The peak occurred in May, with a slight dip in June. Data also revealed that just 27 whale wallets were responsible for over $411 billion of May’s total, and were executed through only 491 transactions. This highlighted the outsized influence of large investors in driving on-chain liquidity. Tron network now dominates the circulating supply and usage of USDT, far surpassing Ethereum and other networks. More than 10.5 billion transactions have taken place on Tron to date following a steady growth trajectory since 2018.

In collaboration with Bybit and Solana Foundation, the platform sets out to build towards a truly distributed financial system accessible to everyone. A Platform with Laser-Sharp Purpose: Bringing Authenticity Back On-Chain At its core, Byreal is building a genuine, open, and transparent financial order. It seeks to welcome both professional and retail participants into a unified onchain economy where capital is deployed with conviction. This vision is a direct response to what the DeFi space has become: overrun by short-termism, unaudited promises, and superficial growth signals. Byreal believes it is time to reset the narrative—to build infrastructure that rewards substance over noise. To achieve this, Byreal focuses on three core principles: Builder-first – empowering quality projects through curated listings and community-centric launch mechanisms Trader-centric – offering CEX-level execution and tooling without compromising DeFi values Liquidity-deep – bridging blue-chip and real-world assets with Solana’s composability and speed This foundational ethos translates into a suite of flagship products purpose-built to rewire the DeFi experience. Introduces 3 flagship Byreal products - from DEX, Launchpad to Vault 1. Byreal DEX Powered by a smart-routing engine that fuses CLMM and RFQ, the Byreal DEX enables gasless, zero price impact trades with robust MEV protection. In internal benchmarks, the DEX achieved quote speeds of under 200ms, with RFQ orders consistently executing at requested terms, delivering zero slippage and zero gas fees, setting a new standard for decentralized trading on Solana. 2. Reset Launch The platform’s launchpad introduces features like the Smart Price Ladder, Fairshare Engine, and price-based allocation mechanics, a direct answer to the industry-harming inefficiencies of blind airdrop farming. Reset Launch enables real investors to access high-quality IDOs with fairness, transparency, and aligned incentives. 3. Revive Vault Offering frictionless yield strategies, Revive Vault includes bbSOL-exclusive vaults, diverse ecosystem selections, and integrated on/off-chain yield flows. This empowers users to deploy capital across Solana with efficiency, security, and competitive returns. Together, these products form a unified, full-cycle growth engine, supporting asset discovery, trading, and yield generation in one composable interface. Additionally, Byreal provides real asset accessibility, dual liquidity engines, and institutional-grade execution into a unified, full-cycle growth engine supporting asset discovery, trading, and yield generation across multiple ecosystems. Emily Bao, Founder of Byreal, said, “A great exchange doesn’t just facilitate transactions — it helps the world discover what’s truly valuable and gives those assets the liquidity they deserve. The next wave of value won’t be unlocked by hype, but by platforms that help real assets find real markets. Byreal is built to do exactly that — turning fragmented liquidity into unified opportunity.” Ben Zhou, Co-founder and CEO of Bybit, states, ""The future of trading lies in the seamless integration of centralized and decentralized exchanges. Byreal embodies this vision by serving as the on-chain outpost of CEX while bringing blue-chip assets and institutional-grade liquidity into the decentralized world. Bybit is proud to pioneer this CEX+DEX integration trend, leading the way for a new era of unlocking unprecedented liquidity and market access."" Lily Liu, President of the Solana Foundation, said, ""Byreal’s focus on improving liquidity infrastructure and bringing capital market assets onchain is closely aligned with Solana’s long-term vision. We’re encouraged by the team’s approach to building DeFi-native tools that prioritize accessibility, efficiency, and composability on Solana.” Byreal’s testnet is live now, with its mainnet launch scheduled for late Q3 2025.

46474637,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=171097,1750508448,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/46474637.jpeg,"Urgent Alert: Altcoin Season Index Plunges to 19, Signaling Bitcoin Dominance",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/altcoin-season-index-bitcoin-12/,"BitcoinWorld Urgent Alert: Altcoin Season Index Plunges to 19, Signaling Bitcoin Dominance Are you wondering why your favorite altcoins might not be performing as well as Bitcoin lately? The latest data from the Altcoin Season Index provides a clear answer, pointing towards a significant shift in the crypto market landscape. Understanding the Alt coin Season Index The Altcoin Season Index is a valuable tool for cryptocurrency investors and traders. Tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), it offers insight into whether the broader market is favoring altcoins or Bitcoin over a specific period. This index helps gauge market sentiment and identify potential trends. Here’s how the index fundamentally works: It analyzes the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization on CMC. Stablecoins and wrapped tokens are excluded from the calculation to provide a clearer picture of speculative asset performance. The performance of each of these top 100 coins is compared against Bitcoin ‘s performance over the past 90 days. The index score ranges from 1 to 100. The threshold for determining market season is based on how many of these top 100 altcoins outperform Bitcoin : Altcoin Season: Occurs when 75% or more of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. The index score is typically high (above 75). Bitcoin Season: Occurs when 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. The index score is typically low (25 or below). Scores between 26 and 74 generally indicate a neutral or transitional market phase. Why the Altcoin Season Index at 19 Matters As of June 21, at 00:38 UTC, the Altcoin Season Index registered a score of 19. This figure is down three points from the previous day. A score of 19 falls squarely into the definition of Bitcoin Season . This low number signals that a significant majority of the top 100 altcoins have failed to keep pace with, let alone outperform, Bitcoin over the recent 90-day period. This shift isn’t just a number; it reflects capital flows and investor preference. During a Bitcoin Season , investors tend to favor the perceived safety and dominance of Bitcoin , often rotating capital out of smaller, more volatile altcoins . This can lead to Bitcoin seeing stronger price gains or holding its value better during downturns compared to the rest of the crypto market . Navigating the Current Bitcoin Season in the Crypto Market Being in a Bitcoin Season presents both challenges and opportunities for participants in the crypto market . For those holding a diversified portfolio heavily weighted towards altcoins , this period can be frustrating as their holdings may underperform relative to Bitcoin . Challenges during Bitcoin Season: Altcoin Underperformance: Most altcoins will struggle to gain ground against Bitcoin . Increased Volatility for Altcoins: Smaller cap altcoins can experience sharper drops when Bitcoin corrects or consolidates. Lower Trading Volume for Altcoins: Interest and capital can consolidate around Bitcoin , leading to less liquidity in some altcoin markets. Opportunities during Bitcoin Season: Potential for Bitcoin Accumulation: Investors focused on accumulating Bitcoin may find relative strength. Identifying Resilient Altcoins: Some altcoins may show relative strength even during Bitcoin Season , potentially indicating strong fundamentals or specific catalysts. Strategic Positioning: Understanding the current market phase allows investors to adjust their strategies, perhaps increasing Bitcoin exposure or waiting for the market to signal a potential shift back towards altcoins . What Does This Mean for Your Altcoins ? If you hold altcoins , the current Bitcoin Season means you should temper expectations regarding their short-term performance relative to Bitcoin . It doesn’t necessarily mean all altcoins will lose value, but their gains are likely to lag significantly behind Bitcoin ‘s, or they may even see declines while Bitcoin remains relatively stable or rises. Consider reviewing your portfolio: Diversification: Is your portfolio overly exposed to smaller altcoins ? Risk Tolerance: Are you comfortable with the increased volatility that altcoins might experience during this phase? Long-Term View: For projects you believe in long-term, periods of underperformance against Bitcoin can sometimes present accumulation opportunities, but caution is advised as further drops are possible. This phase underscores Bitcoin ‘s continued dominance and its role as the primary driver of overall market sentiment and capital movement. While the dream of massive, quick gains in small altcoins is often associated with Altcoin Season , the current data indicates we are in a different part of the market cycle. Conclusion: Staying Informed in the Crypto Market The Altcoin Season Index at 19 serves as a clear indicator that the crypto market is currently experiencing Bitcoin Season . This phase is characterized by Bitcoin ‘s relative strength and the underperformance of most altcoins . Understanding this market dynamic is crucial for making informed decisions. While market cycles can shift rapidly, the data suggests caution for aggressive altcoin plays and highlights the importance of monitoring Bitcoin ‘s performance. Keeping an eye on the Altcoin Season Index and other market indicators will be key to identifying potential shifts back towards a more favorable environment for altcoins in the future.
