Why Analysts Compare MAGACOIN FINANCE to Early SHIBA INU Growth,https://timestabloid.com/1000x-potential-why-analysts-compare-magacoin-finance/,"In 2021, Shiba Inu (SHIB) stunned the world with historic gains, turning a meme coin into a multi-billion-dollar ecosystem almost overnight. Now in 2025, crypto analysts are eyeing a new contender: MAGACOIN FINANCE —a rising altcoin in presale that some believe could deliver 1000x returns , just like SHIB did in its early days. While Shiba Inu works to evolve from speculation to real utility, MAGACOIN FINANCE is entering the market with momentum, community energy, and a scalable roadmap—sparking comparisons to SHIB’s breakout phase . Let’s break down what’s happening with SHIB, and why MAGACOIN FINANCE may be one of the best altcoins to buy in 2025 for exponential gains. Shiba Inu Faces Technical Hurdles — But Remains Long-Term Focused Shiba Inu finds itself at a crossroads. One of the signals that the technical analysts gave on August 18, 2025, is the emergence of a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern on their charts. Besides the pattern, the data showed that the number of new wallet addresses was decreasing and that the TVL (Total Value Locked) for Shibarium had dropped by 95%. Besides this, the activity of the whales has also decreased considerably, which is indicative of the lack of strength in the market for the near future. Key Issues: Potential 20% downside if SHIB breaks below $0.00001027. Whale and retail engagement dropping amid macro uncertainty. Bearish sentiment despite solid community size. However, SHIB’s development team is actively working to improve fundamentals: A new developer hub launched on Mintlify to attract builders. Shibarium still handles 4M daily transactions, showing ongoing network use. Over 264 million addresses have been created on Shibarium to date. ShibDAO governance, RPC improvements, and DeFi SDKs have been implemented to improve the ecosystem. SHIB’s perspective for quite a while is positive; however, a lot of investors are beginning to ask themselves whether the next 1000x project will be in another place. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Why Analysts See 1000x Upside Potential The current presale of MAGACOIN FINANCE offers ultra-low entry prices , echoing SHIB’s earliest moments—before its breakout to billions in market cap. Analysts say that if the coin maintains this pace of adoption and hits mainstream exchanges, a 1000x return isn’t just hype—it’s possible , particularly if sentiment shifts in its favor during the next bull run. SHIB proved it was possible with its historic run in 2021, and now MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining attention for its strong community, early-stage momentum, and low entry price—offering similar high-reward potential. Most investors wish they had gotten into SHIB before the hype. But many waited for confirmation—by then, 90% of the gains were already priced in. With MAGACOIN FINANCE , investors are still early. The project is: In presale at a steep discount. Gaining momentum with retail and viral interest. Backed by a vision to combine meme culture with real-world financial tools . If you missed SHIB’s rocket ride, this may be your next best shot. Final Thoughts While Shiba Inu evolves into a Layer-2 project with real DeFi utility, the days of 1000x gains from SHIB may be behind us. But MAGACOIN FINANCE is still in its earliest stages —just as SHIB was when only the boldest believed in its potential. With meme energy, strategic utility, and low presale pricing , MAGACOIN FINANCE is fast becoming one of the most talked-about early-stage cryptos of 2025. If history repeats—or even rhymes—this could be the next great crypto success story.

50308367,559080,1755558048,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50308367.jpeg,$500M Liquidations Rock Ethereum and Bitcoin: Is the Crash Fueling Whale Accumulation?,https://bitcoinist.com/500m-liquidations-rock-ethereum-and-bitcoin-crash/,"The crypto market faced a brutal correction on Monday, with nearly $500 million in liquidations rattling traders across Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). According to CoinGlass data, over 115,000 traders were liquidated as Bitcoin slipped to $115,000 and Ethereum plunged toward the $4,200 danger zone. The cascade was fueled by high leverage exposure, creating a domino effect of forced selling across exchanges. Bitcoin’s sharp drop erased more than $3,000 in value within hours, pulling major altcoins into the red. ETH fell nearly 5%, while Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE) each dropped 4–5%. XRP tested the critical $3 support level, underscoring the market-wide fragility. Interestingly, Chainlink (LINK) bucked the trend, posting a daily 5% gain despite the turmoil. Ethereum Faces a Liquidation Cliff Ethereum appears particularly vulnerable if its price breaks below $4,200. Data from Hyperdash shows that more than 56,000 ETH long positions, worth about $236 million, sit at risk of liquidation near $4,170. Additional liquidation clusters are positioned around $3,940 and $2,150–$2,160, levels that could amplify volatility if triggered. Andrew Kang, founder of Mechanism Capital, warned that ETH could fall as low as $3,600 if the liquidation cascade continues. He added that overall ETH liquidations across exchanges could reach $5 billion, potentially driving prices even lower before stabilizing. Bitcoin Whale Accumulation or General Market Breakdown? Despite the sell-off, some analysts argue the crash may be setting up a whale accumulation phase. Crypto analyst CrypNuevo noted that Bitcoin recently printed a new all-time high before a sudden $1 billion liquidation event, a move he believes was engineered to flush out retail traders. He suggested that one whale absorbed much of the forced selling, signaling that institutional players may be scooping up BTC at discounted prices. If whales are indeed accumulating, the dip could serve as a springboard for the next rally once leveraged positions reset and selling pressure eases. However, with geopolitical uncertainty and fragile support levels, traders should remain cautious. The coming days will determine whether Bitcoin stabilizes above $115,000 and Ethereum holds $4,200, or if another wave of liquidations drags the market deeper into correction.

However, it is advised to do your own research and conduct expert opinion before investing in the volatile crypto market. Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Source: Coinmarketcap Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana’s (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150. In May the price continued to rise and ended the month above the $165 price level, a trend that could not extend through June as the month saw a decline falling below the $150 price level to end the month. July saw a sharp rise to the asset’s volatility with SOL crossing the $200 mark. However, the price could not be maintained and SOL ended the month below the $180 level.",Crypto Price Predictions|Solana,EN,0,0,SOL|TRADING|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-18 23:10:00

50306832,https://timestabloid.com/?p=79136,1755559217,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,SEC Delays Decision on Grayscale Spot XRP ETF. Here’s New Timeline,https://timestabloid.com/sec-delays-decision-on-grayscale-spot-xrp-etf-heres-new-timeline/,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has delayed its decision on the application to list and trade shares of the Grayscale XRP Trust as a spot XRP exchange-traded fund. The application was initially submitted by NYSE Arca on January 30, 2025, with an amendment filed on February 10 . Following these submissions, the amended proposal was published in the Federal Register on February 20, which marked the beginning of the SEC’s review process. On March 11, the Commission extended the review period, and by May 20, it issued an Order Instituting Proceedings to allow for further analysis and additional public comments. This order did not signal approval or rejection; it reflects the need for a deeper examination of whether the exchange’s proposal aligns with the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act, including provisions designed to prevent fraud, manipulation, and to protect investors. SEC’s Reason for Delay Under the Securities Exchange Act, the SEC is required to decide within 180 days after publishing a proposed rule change. However, it can extend it by an additional 60 days if more time is deemed necessary. In its most recent notice on August 18, 2025, the Commission announced that it was exercising this option, extending the deadline for action to October 18, 2025. The agency explained that this extension was appropriate to provide more time for thorough consideration of the filing and the issues raised in the record. This decision aligns with the Commission’s approach to similar digital asset ETF applications, where delays are common as part of the standard review process. By pushing the deadline forward, the SEC has given itself until mid-October to issue a final approval or disapproval of the Grayscale proposal. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Outlook for October The delay does not alter the substance of the application but indicates that the SEC will use the full timeframe allowed under law before making its decision. Between now and the new deadline, the Commission will continue reviewing whether the safeguards and structures proposed by NYSE Arca and Grayscale adequately address investor protection standards and market integrity requirements. As of now, the Grayscale spot XRP ETF remains pending and has not received approval. Trading on NYSE Arca cannot proceed unless the Commission issues a favorable order. The October 18, 2025, deadline represents the final statutory date for action, meaning the SEC must either approve or reject the proposal at that time. Until then, the application remains under review, with the outcome depending on the Commission’s assessment of the full record.

50307322,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=787175,1755559265,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50307322.jpeg,Texas is investigating Meta and Character.ai for marketing chatbots as therapists,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/meta-and-character-ai-face-investigation/,"Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has opened an inquiry into Meta and Character.ai on whether the tech firms promote their chatbots as mental health experts and therapists without proper qualifications. In a statement on Monday, Paxton’s office stated it is examining Meta and Character.AI over possible “deceptive trade practices.” The office argued that the chatbots have been marketed as “professional therapeutic tools, despite lacking proper medical credentials or oversight.” “By posing as sources of emotional support, AI platforms can mislead vulnerable users, especially children, into believing they’re receiving legitimate mental healthcare,” Paxton mentioned. The move lands as consumer-facing AI products face rising questions about how well they protect vulnerable users, and minors in particular, from harmful or graphic material, the risk of compulsive use, and privacy lapses tied to the large volumes of data needed to train and run these systems. Texas’s action follows a separate Senate inquiry into Meta reported by Cryptopolitan earlier on Friday, after internal leaked files suggested the company’s rules allowed its chatbot to engage in “romantic” and “sensual” conversations with users under 18. Senator Josh Hawley told Zuckerberg in a letter that the Senate will probe into the possibility of the tech firm’s generative AI tools enabling harm to children. “Is there anything — ANYTHING — Big Tech won’t do for a quick buck?” Hawley wrote on X. Is there anything – ANYTHING – Big Tech won’t do for a quick buck? Now we learn Meta’s chatbots were programmed to carry on explicit and “sensual” talk with 8 year olds. It’s sick. I’m launching a full investigation to get answers. Big Tech: Leave our kids alone pic.twitter.com/Ki0W94jWfo — Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) August 15, 2025 Meta says that its policies ban harm to children Meta said that its policies ban content that harms children in such ways. It added that Reuters first reported the “internal materials” leaked, which “were and are erroneous and inconsistent with our policies, and have been removed.” Zuckerberg has committed billions toward building “personal superintelligence” and positioning Meta as an “AI leader.” The company has released its Llama family of LLMs and rolled out the Meta chatbot across its social apps. Zuckerberg also described a potential therapeutic use case for the technology. “For people who don’t have a person who’s a therapist, I think everyone will have an AI,” he said in a podcast with Ben Thompson in May. Character.ai makes chatbots with distinct personas and lets users design their own. The platform includes many user-created therapist-like bots. One bot, called “Psychologist,” has recorded over 200 million interactions. The company has also been named in lawsuits brought by families who claim their children were harmed in the real world after using the service. Paxton’s office mentioned that Character.ai and Meta chatbots may impersonate licensed health professionals and invent new credentials, making it seem like the interactions are confidential, even though the companies themselves mention that all conversations get logged. These conversations are also “exploited for targeted advertising and algorithmic development,” Paxton’s office said. Paxton’s office issued a Civil Investigative Demand The attorney general has issued a Civil Investigative Demand requiring the companies to provide information that could show whether they violated laws related to Texas consumer protection. Meta said it marks AI experiences clearly and warns users about limitations. The company added, “We include a disclaimer that responses are generated by AI — not people. These AIs aren’t licensed professionals and our models are designed to direct users to seek qualified medical or safety professionals when appropriate.” Similarly, Character.ai said it uses prominent notices as a reminder that AI personas are not real and should not be viewed as professionals. “The user-created Characters on our site are fictional, they are intended for entertainment, and we have taken robust steps to make that clear,” the company said. The dual struggles, a state probe in Texas and a Senate review in Washington, place fresh pressure on how AI chatbots are built, marketed, and moderated, and on what companies tell users about the limits of automated support.

Ethereum and HBAR remain staples for steady growth, while MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining traction as a hidden presale contender with explosive upside potential. Together with Solana, Litecoin, and PEPE, these tokens form a list of seven cryptos analysts believe are well-positioned for high-multiple returns in the next cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE — Breakout Presale Contender Ethereum and HBAR are strongholds, but analysts say MAGACOIN FINANCE could outperform with 35x growth potential . Its combination of scarcity-driven tokenomics and accelerating whale inflows is pushing MAGACOIN FINANCE onto analyst watchlists as one of 2025’s hottest early-stage opportunities. Already raising millions and with allocations running low, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly emerging as a presale standout for investors seeking high-multiple growth. Also Investors who use PATRIOT50X can secure a 50% EXTRA presale bonus, available for a short time on the platform. Ethereum (ETH) — Market Leader Despite Selloffs Ethereum is currently priced at $4,375.53, down 2.23% in the last 24 hours after facing aggressive selling pressure. Over the past day, ETH has traded in a range between $4,227 and $4,484, reflecting volatility fueled by significant liquidations as investors line up to unstake tokens. Despite these short-term headwinds, Ethereum maintains a market cap above $526 billion, underlining its strength as the second-largest cryptocurrency. Analysts emphasize that while ETH may see near-term fluctuations, its long-term outlook remains intact thanks to strong institutional inflows, over 1.7 million daily transactions, and its critical role in powering DeFi and smart contracts. Hedera (HBAR) — Institutional Utility Play HBAR trades near $0.246, slightly lower after a 2% daily dip. Backed by enterprise-grade partnerships and an average 50-day price of $0.23, Hedera remains resilient even in volatile conditions. With its energy-efficient hashgraph technology and growing use cases in tokenization and payments, HBAR continues to attract institutional adoption, making it a compelling long-term hold. Solana (SOL) — Ecosystem Resilience Solana trades at around $185 following a 3% daily decline but remains well-supported above its 50-day average of $172. With strong DeFi activity, NFT adoption, and upcoming ETF decisions drawing institutional attention, Solana continues to be one of the most watched long-term plays in the market. Litecoin (LTC) — The Veteran Performer Litecoin remains steady at $118, trading within a stable range and comfortably above its 50-day average of $106. As one of the longest-standing cryptocurrencies, LTC is known for its reliability and liquidity, providing a consistent option for investors seeking stability within a diversified portfolio. Shiba Inu (SHIB) — Community-Driven Growth Shiba Inu remains one of the most recognized meme coins, supported by an expansive community and ongoing ecosystem upgrades. Its currently trading around $0.00001267 and its move into Shibarium, its Layer-2 scaling solution, has given it a utility-driven narrative beyond meme status. As adoption grows and token burns accelerate, SHIB is being positioned as a long-term meme asset with significant upside potential. PEPE — Meme Coin with Staying Power PEPE trades around $0.00001067 with over $600 million in daily trading volume, underscoring its continued relevance. Despite volatility, PEPE’s community-driven momentum and liquidity profile make it a speculative but viable addition for long-term investors looking to capture meme coin cycles. Conclusion — Building a Balanced Portfolio Ethereum, with its $526 billion market cap and central role in DeFi, remains the anchor for institutional portfolios. HBAR offers enterprise utility, Solana brings ecosystem growth, Litecoin delivers veteran stability, and PEPE captures speculative upside. But among these, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly highlighted as the hidden gem with 35x potential , making it a strategic addition for investors seeking outsized returns in the 2025 cycle.

The satellite internet service run by Elon Musk’s SpaceX stopped working for thousands of users on Monday night. Reports poured in through Downdetector , the go-to platform for tracking tech outages. Users across the globe said their connections just dropped out, no warning, nothing. Starlink already had a major blackout just two weeks ago, dragging on for hours. According to SpaceX VP of Starlink Engineering Michael Nicolls, it happened because of a “failure of key internal software services that operate the core network.” No updates were shared this time, at least not by press time. SpaceX sends more satellites up as California pushes back That July 24 crash hit right after T-Mobile launched its new Starlink-based service. The carrier promised direct-to-cell connectivity for areas with no signal at all. According to T-Mobile, this new setup should work “in places no carrier towers can reach.” It’s supposed to let phones connect straight to the satellite system without any ground infrastructure. Starlink currently serves over six million users in 140 countries, according to SpaceX’s own website. But the company doesn’t publish any numbers about how many users stick around or how many leave. That means nobody outside SpaceX really knows how stable or profitable the customer base is. What is public, though, is the sheer size of the Starlink fleet. Research from astronomer Jonathan McDowell shows that more than 7,000 broadband satellites are actively working in orbit right now. That’s way more than any other company trying to do the same thing. And SpaceX isn’t stopping. On the same day users were facing problems, SpaceX launched another group of Starlink satellites from Vandenberg Space Force Base in Southern California. The timing was almost too perfect, down on Earth, users were cut off from the internet In space, more satellites were flying out to join the constellation. According to the company’s plans, launches from Vandenberg are expected to double soon, from 50 to around 100 each year. But not everyone is on board. Last Thursday, the California Coastal Commission voted unanimously to block the U.S. Space Force’s application to allow SpaceX to ramp up those launches. The issue? Nobody has properly looked into what that kind of activity could do to the environment. The commission said SpaceX and the Space Force failed to submit reports about the impact of more launches on nearby communities and local wildlife. Noise, vibrations, chemical use; it all adds up. And they’re not willing to greenlight 100 launches a year without answers. This vote directly affects how quickly SpaceX can expand Starlink through Vandenberg. And while that drama was happening, another piece moved in Washington. Donald Trump signed an executive order to weaken environmental regulations that companies like SpaceX say are slowing them down. The new rule is meant to make it easier for commercial space firms to launch rockets without all the red tape. Whether that’ll help Elon in California remains to be seen, since state-level commissions don’t always bow to federal orders. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

The FIU said it will conduct stablecoin-related research via external contractors. It will then compile its findings in December this year before drafting a set of guidelines for stablecoin operators and issuers. Per The Bell Korea , the regulator is likely to recommend amendments to the Specific Financial Information Act, with “significant changes” in store. The South Korean National Assembly Building in Seoul, South Korea. (Source: National Assembly [KOGL Type 1]) South Korean Regulator Readies Stablecoin Regulations The regulator is likely to impose entry restrictions and business conduct regulations. Many of these will likely focus on the security of the assets that underpin any South Korean stablecoins, as well as data reporting criteria. An FIU official said that December’s research report would “serve as a foundation for developing AML response measures in response to changes in the virtual asset industry and the institutionalization of stablecoins.” The official added that the measures would help “improve and supplement the existing system.” The FIU currently plays a key role in policing domestic crypto exchanges and ensuring their AML compliance. And the reorganization appears to suggest it expects to become the top AML regulatory authority for stablecoin issuers, despite plans to scrap its parent organization, the Financial Services Commission (FSC). President Lee Jae-myung has previously announced his intention to do away with the FSC. He wants to merge its operations with those of the finance ministry and the Financial Supervisory Service. President Lee Jae Myung’s approval rating has dropped for the second straight week, sinking to a record low of 51.1 percent, a poll showed Monday. The slide comes amid growing controversy over his Liberation Day pardons. https://t.co/VYWndBDJoZ — The Korea JoongAng Daily (@JoongAngDaily) August 18, 2025 However, recent government plan announcements have made no further mention of scrapping the FSC . And the Blue House has even assigned it crypto-related tasks for 2025. FIU Set for Important Regulatory Role? The FIU’s plans, which involve conducting a study on international stablecoin regulations, appear to suggest the regulator expects to police the industry ahead of the rollout of legislation. Several stablecoin bills are on the agenda at the National Assembly. However, lawmakers are yet to fine-tune the details of these draft laws. They continue to deliberate matters like the possible launch of stablecoin lending services. Critics note that the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and other organizations have warned that stablecoin adoption can lead to increased money laundering risks. The Bell Korea noted that many countries, including the United States, have been “quick to develop countermeasures.” Conversely, it noted, South Korea, is a “latecomer,” in this regard, as it “still lacks a comprehensive system.” The media outlet also added that South Korea “still lacks a clear legal definition of stablecoins.” Thus far, most AML-related legislation (including the Special Financial Transactions Act) and regulations relate to exchanges and crypto wallet operators. Big Businesses Ready to Make Stablecoin Moves While lawmakers are yet to form a firm consensus on stablecoin legislation, both major parties agree that businesses should be allowed to issue or make use of KRW-pegged coins. The headquarters of the South Korean tech giant Naver. (Source: Maskkwon [CC BY-SA 4.0]) Some of the country’s biggest banks and tech firms have responded by registering stablecoin-related trademarks. Others have already launched dedicated stablecoin business units as they await the National Assembly’s green light.

The report, conducted in partnership with The Harris Poll, surveyed 615 developers in the US, South Korea, Norway, Finland, and Sweden in late June and early July. Most of the respondents said AI agents were easing the burden of repetitive or technical work, per the report . Forty-four percent said they were using agents to optimize content and process information at speed, enabling them to focus on more creative responsibilities. Ninety-four percent expect AI to bring down development costs in the long run, though nearly a quarter of the respondents said it remained difficult to quantify return on investment, particularly given the high upfront costs of integration. The video game industry is in crisis The relationship between video game developers and AI hasn’t exactly been rosy. Between 2022 and May 2025, more than 35,000 workers were laid off across the global games business, with large publishers such as Embracer Group, Electronic Arts, Unity, Microsoft , and Sony all cutting staff. According to industry trackers, it is the most sustained wave of job losses in the sector’s history. At Microsoft, which shed around 9,000 gaming jobs, workers and union organizers have accused management of prioritizing investment in AI initiatives over staff retention. In one highly controversial case, about 200 developers at King, the Activision Blizzard subsidiary known for Candy Crush, were reportedly replaced by AI tools they had helped design, sparking outrage among colleagues and industry peers. Unions have become increasingly vocal. Blizzard’s narrative design team last month voted to unionize, one week after workers on the Call of Duty franchise did the same. Opinions are divided on AI as industry ponders way forward While most developers in the Google study cited efficiency gains, most of them still agree that there are some gray areas that need better clarification. 63% of respondents expressed concern over data ownership, with questions unresolved about whether studios or creators hold rights to AI-generated content. The “State of the Game Industry” survey, published in January ahead of the Game Developers Conference, painted a more skeptical picture. It found that more than half of studios were already experimenting with generative AI, but nearly a third of respondents characterized its impact as negative. They warned of homogenized content, algorithmic bias, and potential job erosion. At July’s Develop conference in Brighton, panelists argued that human oversight remained essential to authenticity and inclusion in storytelling, stressing that AI tools should not replace lived experience or cultural nuance. For many workers, AI represents not only a technical shift but a profound restructuring of how games are made and who gets to make them. Unions are expected to expand as staff seek to safeguard pay and creative input. Meanwhile, investors and executives are betting that the cost savings promised by automation will outweigh legal, reputational, and cultural risks.

New installs on Google Play are consistently falling year over year. In July 2025, new installs of X on Google Play fell 44% year over year worldwide, while downloads from Apple’s App Store rose 15%, highlighting a widening gap between the two mobile platforms. TechCrunch reported that the slump on Android is dragging down the service’s overall momentum. Appfigures reports that total mobile downloads in July were down 26% from a year earlier. The picture had looked worse a month prior, when total installs were off by 35% year over year as Android downloads at the time had dropped by nearly half, at 49%. X’s Android app has long been seen as a problem point, with users complaining about crashes and instability. Nikita Bier, recently appointed as X’s head of product and known for growing teen-focused apps like Gas and TBH before selling them, has suggested that the company will tackle Android performance head-on. On X, Bier announced hiring for an “Android Dream Team” charged with rebuilding the Android client. He also said the iOS app just logged a record week for installs, a data point that underscored Apple-side momentum even as Android lagged. Where those missing Android users might be going is not apparent. Bluesky’s growth has cooled, and its Google Play app collected only 119,000 downloads in July, far below the millions who install X on iOS or Android in a typical month. Meta’s Threads, however, has been narrowing the gap with X in daily active users on mobile, suggesting some Android users may be shifting attention there. The reduced installs on Google Play are hurting X revenue Appfigures found that X generated $16.9 million in net revenue in July, down from $18.8 million in March 2025. July was slightly better than June’s $16.8 million, but the broader trend has been hard to ignore. Most of X’s overall revenue still comes from advertising rather than premium subscriptions sold inside the apps. Falling demand for Android likely explains part of the revenue pressure. Another factor is that Grok now offers its own stand-alone app, attracting users who previously paid for X subscriptions mainly to unlock AI features. Those customers may be switching to Grok directly. Appfigures said the July snapshot reflects performance across devices, giving a clear view of how Android and iOS are diverging. Musk’s SpaceX continues expansion despite setbacks Meanwhile, SpaceX’s Starlink service experienced a separate setback. The satellite internet network was reported down for users around the world, according to Downdetector, which flagged issues beginning at about 1:30 p.m. ET. Affected customers described sluggish speeds, drop-offs in connectivity, and, in many cases, total service blackouts. Despite the rough patch, expansion plans are still on the calendar. Cryptopolitan recently reported that SpaceX’s BTC holdings have crossed $1 billion, which is undoubtedly a win for the space firm. SpaceX has also listed Uzbekistan as a 2026 launch market for Starlink on the service’s website, pointing to a new foothold in Central Asia next year. And in a near-term move, Kazakhstan’s government has announced a start date for service. “Starting from 13 August 2025, Starlink will officially begin providing satellite internet services in the territory of the Republic of Kazakhstan.” the Ministry of Digital Development, Innovation and Aerospace Industry of Kazakhstan reported.

The OpenAI CEO told a few reporters in San Francisco that Donald Trump’s latest ban on advanced chips won’t stop China from pushing forward in artificial intelligence. According to CNBC, Sam met journalists over Mediterranean food in the Presidio and laid out how bad the situation really is. “I’m worried about China,” he said. He warned that this isn’t some race where one side pulls ahead and wins. “There’s inference capacity, where China probably can build faster,” Sam said. “There’s research, there’s product; a lot of layers to the whole thing.” He explained that the U.S. is focused on just one piece, blocking chip exports, while China is working on the entire stack. And despite growing controls, Sam doesn’t think any of it is actually helping. “My instinct is that doesn’t work,” he said when asked if fewer GPUs reaching China would be a win. Trump blocks chips, but Sam says the policy is failing Trump, now back in the White House, signed off on a full stop of high-end chip exports to China in April 2025. That went even further than the earlier rules from President Joe Biden, which had already added restrictions to slow China’s access to advanced AI hardware. Trump’s new policy stopped even modified chips, the ones designed to pass Biden’s rules, from going out. But just last week, Washington changed the rules again. Under a new deal, Nvidia and AMD can now sell certain “China-safe” chips again. But they have to give 15% of their China revenue from those sales to the U.S. government. Sam didn’t talk about that deal directly, but he made it clear that trying to manage AI progress through policy alone isn’t realistic. “You can export-control one thing, but maybe not the right thing… maybe people build fabs or find other workarounds,” he said. “I’d love an easy solution,” he added. “But my instinct is: That’s hard.” He made it clear that this isn’t just about the chips. Chinese firms are already working with their own suppliers like Huawei. The controls from Washington haven’t stopped China. If anything, they’ve made Chinese companies move faster. While the U.S. stays dependent on Nvidia and AMD, Chinese labs are building alternatives. China’s rise pushes OpenAI to release new models Sam said that China’s progress in AI also pushed OpenAI to start opening up its own models. For years, the company refused to release full models, choosing to lock everything behind APIs. But now, with China releasing more open tools like DeepSeek, OpenAI is changing direction. “It was clear that if we didn’t do it, the world was gonna head to be mostly built on Chinese open source models,” Sam said. “That was a factor in our decision, for sure. Wasn’t the only one, but that loomed large.” OpenAI just released two new models: gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b. These are its first open-weight models since GPT-2 dropped in 2019. The new ones aren’t fully open source, the training data and source code are still locked, but the weights are now public. That means developers can download and run them, even offline. The goal, Sam said, was to support people building locally-run coding agents. Sam admitted these models won’t blow anyone away. Some developers say they’re missing key features. He didn’t argue. The team built them for one thing only, he said, and if needs change, they’ll adjust. “If the kind of demand shifts in the world,” he said, “you can push it to something else.” Right now, OpenAI is the only major U.S. company going this route. Meta had gone open with its Llama models before, but CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently said they might stop. That puts OpenAI out front, at least for now, as Chinese labs keep releasing flexible tools that anyone can use. Sam once said that locking up models had put OpenAI “on the wrong side of history.” This new decision looks like an effort to fix that. But it’s also a way to keep developers inside OpenAI instead of losing them to Chinese labs offering more freedom.

No damage has been reported yet, but history suggests that extensive losses could occur once the harm has been done. Taking Over Control The cryptocurrency exchange Kraken has temporarily stopped Monero deposits to the platform due to the ongoing 51% attack against the privacy-focused blockchain. This attack is made possible when a single mining entity controls over 50% of the network’s hash rate (the computational power needed to validate transactions), allowing them to double-spend (i.e., unauthorized production and spending of money) and reorder transactions on the blockchain ledger. This was flagged by the exchange on Friday, and as of the time of writing, there has been a new update posted: “Monero (XMR) deposits have been re-enabled and now require 720 confirmations before crediting. Given the current uncertainty around the security of the Monero network due to significant consolidation of hash rate under a single entity, Kraken may halt deposits at any time and delay crediting at its discretion.” The mining pool responsible for the disruption is Qubic, a blockchain that hosts an AI model called AIGarth. According to a post on their blog, this was an experiment they conducted earlier last week, and they claimed this was possible via unique consensus models available on their chain. This was aimed at proving that Monero’s network is not secure enough and that Qubic’s validators should be responsible for securing it going forward. They further stated that the “Monero network’s core functionality remains intact. Its privacy, speed, and usability have not been compromised.” The team behind the blockchain network has not yet confirmed or denied any aftereffects of the attack. At press time, the native token, XMR, trades at around $276, even up 4% on the day, unaffected by the event. Source: CoinMarketCap Previous Examples Of Such Attacks While it’s still early to determine if this controversial attack will have any effects on the blockchain, there have been past scenarios where the consequences have been quite detrimental. Ethereum Classic (ETC), a split from the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain we know today, is the “classic” version of the chain that was initially launched in 2015. Between 2019 and 2020, the network suffered two 51% attacks involving double-spending, resulting in over $6 million in losses. Another spin-off, Bitcoin Gold (BTG), the “user-friendly” alternative to Bitcoin (BTC), underwent a double-spend attack in 2018, resulting in a loss of around $18 million. The majority of this type of attack has subsided in recent years, primarily due to technological advancements, blockchain upgrades, and improvements in consensus models. As noted above, we have yet to see the impact of this most recent network security breach.

Cardano, XRP, Ethereum, Avalanche, and MAGACOIN FINANCE are each drawing attention for unique reasons — from technical setups to community-driven traction. Here’s why they are at the center of discussions for 2025. Cardano Nears the Bull Market Door Cardano (ADA) has been building momentum, gaining nearly 20% last week and more than 30% across two consecutive weeks. The asset briefly flipped Tron, reclaiming the ninth-largest spot in market cap rankings. Analysts point to the $1.25 price level as a critical threshold — what they call the “bull market door.” If ADA sustains above this region, analysts expect a major rally phase that could redefine its valuation in 2025. Historical patterns show ADA facing resistance near this zone in 2022 and 2023, but breaking past it would signal a structural shift. Analyst Dan Gambardello has emphasized that a breakout above this point opens the path to higher levels, with projections running into double digits. Adding to the case, futures market activity has surged, with volumes hitting $7 billion in a single week — the highest in five months. That level of activity highlights growing conviction in ADA as one of the top altcoins to watch closely heading into 2025. XRP Price Stalls After SEC Case Ends Ripple’s XRP settled its long-running legal battle with the U.S. SEC last week, a case that stretched nearly five years. The resolution briefly lifted XRP to $3.38, but it has since retraced to $2.95, leaving many questioning the subdued response. The lack of follow-through suggests that most of the optimism was priced in earlier. Analysts note that XRP surged fivefold in the weeks following Trump’s re-election, anticipating a more crypto-friendly policy stance. With that run-up already in place, the actual case dismissal triggered a “buy the rumor, sell the news” effect. Still, longer-term expectations remain high. Analysts like Dark Defender dismiss the idea that XRP will remain near current levels for long, instead projecting multi-fold gains if adoption accelerates. Many argue that for XRP to move higher, Ripple must convert its regulatory win into practical adoption by financial institutions. With tokenization services and partnerships on the agenda, XRP remains on analysts’ radar as a top altcoin to watch for 2025. Ethereum and Avalanche Strengthen Institutional Appeal Ethereum continues to dominate institutional discussions, with ETH closing above $4,400 — its strongest weekly finish since 2021. A wave of ETF-driven demand has pushed inflows past $2.9 billion in a single week, according to CoinShares. BlackRock’s ETHA product alone now holds nearly $15 billion in ETH. This surge in institutional interest comes alongside record network usage, with July recording over 46 million transactions across stablecoins, DeFi, and Layer 2 solutions. These fundamentals set Ethereum apart as not just the largest altcoin by market cap but also one of the most widely integrated in real-world finance. Analysts suggest that if ETF inflows continue at this pace, Ethereum could be positioned for new all-time highs in the cycle ahead. Avalanche (AVAX), meanwhile, is building its case as a programmable payments platform. Recent developments include a $250 million real-world asset tokenization deal and Visa’s integration for stablecoin settlements across multiple currencies. Daily transactions on the Avalanche network have doubled in the past two weeks, highlighting rising utility even as prices faced pullbacks. Institutional endorsements add weight to Avalanche’s long-term role. Notably, Norway’s $1.7 trillion sovereign wealth fund has indirect exposure through crypto-linked firms tied to AVAX. Although short-term volatility remains, both Ethereum and Avalanche are cited by analysts as top-tier altcoins to monitor for 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE Attracts Thousands of Holders MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly become one of the best altcoins to buy now, drawing thousands of holders with demand rising by the hour. Millions has already flowed in, making it one of the most active launches in the space this year. Analysts highlight MAGACOIN as a standout due to its pace of adoption and fast-rising price traction. With over 12,000 wallets already in, MAGACOIN is being positioned alongside bigger names for 2025 discussions. Its growing visibility across X and Telegram has also fueled urgency among early buyers who see this as the entry point before wider exchange listings. Main Takeaway Cardano, XRP, Ethereum, Avalanche, and MAGACOIN FINANCE are all in focus as altcoins to watch for 2025. Each brings a different driver — from institutional inflows to surging community adoption. For those looking at entry points, MAGACOIN FINANCE is seeing rapid demand right now, with its price gaining traction every hour. Access MAGACOIN FINANCE via the official website.

While Bitcoin is widely regarded as the leading cryptocurrency with long-term stability, Shultz’s calculations indicate that XRP could deliver substantially higher gains under certain scenarios. Bitcoin’s Potential At the time of analysis, Bitcoin was trading near $120,643. A $5,000 investment at this price would purchase approximately 0.041 BTC. If Bitcoin were to reach $1 million per coin within five years, that position would be valued at around $41,400, representing a gain of roughly 730%, or just over eight times the original investment. Although this return is significant, it may not offer the same upside potential as some alternative cryptocurrencies. Influential figures like Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson and former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey have predicted that Bitcoin could surpass $1 million by 2030, supporting its long-term appeal. $5,000 in Bitcoin or XRP?

A $5,000 investment would acquire approximately 1,558 tokens. If XRP were to reach $100 within five years, the investment would be worth about $155,800, more than 30 times the initial price and roughly five times the projected profit from Bitcoin. Shultz emphasized that focusing solely on absolute price targets can be misleading. While Bitcoin’s million-dollar goal captures public attention, XRP’s lower entry price allows for a much higher percentage gain if it achieves substantial growth. For investors seeking maximum returns in a five-year timeframe, XRP presents a compelling case, assuming its price rises significantly. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Is $100 for XRP Realistic? Achieving $100 would require XRP to increase by over 3,000% from its current level. Opinions within the crypto community differ widely. Matthew Brienen , COO at CryptoCharged, considers reaching $100 highly likely by 2030. Conversely, a report by Bitwise projects a more conservative scenario, with XRP potentially reaching only around $29. Some community analysts hold even more aggressive views. Javon Marks suggests XRP could reach $100 within the current year, while Xena claims potential to hit $1,000 per coin, potentially creating more individual millionaires than Bitcoin would at $1 million. Both Bitcoin and XRP offer opportunities for substantial gains, but the scale of potential returns differs. Bitcoin remains the industry leader and carries strong backing from influential figures, yet its current high price limits upside relative to lower-priced assets. XRP, while requiring a dramatic increase to reach $100, could generate far higher returns on a $5,000 investment within the next five years if optimistic forecasts materialize. Investors should consider both the stability of Bitcoin and the high-growth potential of XRP when making strategic decisions.

The company’s aggressive ETH accumulation strategy, led by Tom Lee, mirrors MSTR’s BTC playbook and could unlock staking and DeFi opportunities. Risks include ETH price volatility, share dilution from capital raises, and regulatory uncertainty, making BMNR a high-risk, high-reward investment. I am bullish on BMNR as a leveraged ETH play, believing mass adoption and regulatory clarity could drive substantial shareholder returns over time. Bitmine Immersion Technologies ( BMNR ) has gained a lot of steam as Tom Lee from Fundstrat has transformed what was once a company focused on Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining to a leading Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) treasury company globally. BMNR’s strategy is designed to accumulate ETH through capital raises and strategic purchases and mirror what Michael Saylor has done through Strategy Inc. ( MSTR ). BMNR’s goal is to acquire up to 5% of all the ETH in circulation. While I am not favoring BMNR over holding ETH directly as I currently do, I believe BMNR has the potential for explosive growth as there is leveraged upside potential, which can receive a large premium on the net asset value (NAV) of its ETH holdings. As BMNR acquires more ETH, its NAV will increase, and investors could experience amplified returns if ETH is in an upward trend. If BMNR does reach its goal of owning 5% of the total ETH in circulation, it could enhance network effects and scarcity, which would allow BMNR to outperform the returns of just owning ETH directly, which is reflected in how BTC treasury firms have historically outpaced BTC’s price appreciation. BMNR still maintains some of its prior BTC operations, but the value is becoming more correlated toward ETH, which I am more bullish on because I see BTC as a store of value with minimal to no utility. The move into ETH will provide BMNR with broader crypto ecosystem exposure, which could include large staking rewards and DeFi integrations. As of August 11th, BMNR became the largest ETH treasury globally as it added 316863 ETH over the course of one week, going from 833,137 to 1.15 million, and it is now the 3rd largest crypto treasury globally. As of the current price, BMNR has a NAV of $5.2 billion just on its ETH holdings with a market cap of $6.33 billion. I am bullish on ETH and believe that over the next several years its price per token will have the ability to experience large amounts of appreciation, which is bullish for BMNR as it should trade at a premium to its ETH holdings. BMNR is likely to continue its capital raises, which will expand its NAV and the amount of ETH it holds, which should also lead to tremendous expansion from the levels it’s at today. Seeking Alpha Risks to investing in BMNR Just because I am bullish on ETH and BMNR does not mean that BMNR will produce positive returns in the future. Investing in BMNR is an indirect investment in ETH, as it’s holding 1.15 million ETH with plans to own 5% of the ETH in circulation. BMNR has become the world’s largest holder of ETH, which is still a highly speculative asset that is extremely volatile. If ETH’s price declines, then BMNR could see drastic declines in its share price as it’s the main asset on BMNR’s books. BMRN is frequently issuing new shares using market offerings and public sales, which can lead to significant dilution. As BMNR adds shares to fund its ETH acquisitions, the amount of ETH each share represents could decline and cause the share price to decline in the future. There are also unknown regulatory risks for BMNR as U.S. and global rules could change in the future. There could be risks for ETH as central bank digital currencies may compete with ETH. If mass adoption with ETF doesn’t occur from stablecoins being built on top of it and tokenization of assets becomes a flop, then the utility appeal of ETH will decline, which could cause a massive drop in ETH prices and correlate to large losses for BMNR. Investors should do their own due diligence on ETH and BMNR before allocating any capital toward BMNR, as this is not a traditional equity and it comes with much larger risks. Why I have become very bullish on BMNR BMNR has gone from specializing in immersion-cooled BTC mining to aggressively amassing an ETH treasury under the leadership of Tom Lee, who is a veteran Wall Street analyst and crypto advocate. This strategic pivot has led to substantial capital raises, including a recent expansion of stock offerings to $24.5 billion and their positioning themselves to acquire 5% of the ETH in circulation. BMNR launched its ETH treasury on June 30th, and it's already the largest ETH treasury in the world as it owns 1.15 million ETH with a value of $5.2 billion. BMNR is still operating its ongoing mining operations and hosting services, which provide diversified revenue streams that will complement the ETH focus that BMNR is embarking on. By leveraging equity issuances to fund ETH purchases, BMNR emulates MSTR’s playbook and adapts it to ETH’s smart contract ecosystem, which could unlock staking yields and DeFi integrations to enhance shareholder value. When MSTR started, it was trading at $13.49 while BTC traded for $11,000, and by the end of June 2025, BTC increased by 11x to $118,000 and MSTR increased by 30x to $407.76. BMNR had increased by 9.5x at the end of June, while ETH experienced a 1.5x increase, and the current treasury strategy could lead to larger gains in BMNR’s share price compared to ETH going forward. Bitmine Immersion Technologies ETH is an open-source blockchain platform that is decentralized, which allows end users to create and execute smart contracts and decentralized applications ((dApps)). ETH operates as a peer-to-peer network where participants maintain a shared ledger of transactions without relying on intermediaries like banks or governments, which is secured by a global network of computers operating Ethereum software. The smart contract aspect is a self-executing program stored on the blockchain that automatically runs when predefined conditions are met, which can include transferring funds or executing trades. They power dApps, which can range from decentralized finance platforms to games and social networks. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are designed to maintain a consistent value and bridge traditional finance and crypto by enabling fast, low-cost transactions while preserving stability. ETH has become a primary platform for building and issuing stablecoins due to its widespread adoption. ETH’s smart contract system allows stablecoins to be programmed with automated mechanisms for maintaining their peg, such as collateralization, algorithmic adjustments, or reserves managed via decentralized autonomous organizations. USDC , which is issued by Circle ( CRCL ), is built on ETH because of its secure and scalable environment that supports high liquidity and interoperability. The ERC-20 token standard simplifies creation and integration, which makes it easy for stablecoins to interact with DeFi protocols, exchanges, and wallets on the network. As the leading smart contract blockchain, I believe that ETH will expand its current utilization rate as it is already powering thousands of dApps, DeFi protocols, and stablecoins. There is also the ability to tokenize real-world assets like bonds and real estate, which would position ETH for mainstream integration. We’re seeing mainstream interest surge as BlackRock just purchased an additional $338 million of ETH and SharpLink Gaming ( SBET ) has acquired over $3 billion of ETH since May. There is currently $410 billion worth of value secured on ETH, and the largest institutions are buying large amounts of ETH as more assets become tied to it. I am very bullish on BMNR because it provides leveraged exposure to ETH, and it should trade at a larger premium to NAV in the future. As an ETH Treasury, BMNR can outperform direct ETH holdings as it would generate network effects from its underlying ETH through staking and creating scarcity in the marketplace. While this may sound silly, I believe that BMNR trading as a traditional equity on the NYSE is bullish because it can be bought through standard brokerage accounts, which avoids complexities of crypto exchanges, such as wallet management, private key security, or custody risks. BMNR may also appeal to institutions that don’t want direct exposure to crypto and would rather allocate capital toward an ETH Treasury for exposure to the asset class. The GENIUS Act , which was recently signed into legislation, is the first comprehensive federal regulatory framework for stablecoins, and it aims at fostering innovation in the crypto space. I believe this is bullish for ETH due to its dominant role in the stablecoin ecosystem, and it will pave the way for increased liquidity as ETH will be looked at as a compliant hub for tokenizing real-world assets and payments. We are still in ETH’s infancy, and depending on how widespread the use case gets, ETH could see its price expand considerably, which would be very bullish for BMNR as it should get a levered premium on its trove of ETH. Bitmine Immersion Technologies Conclusion My bull case for BMNR is tied to increased utilization across the ETH ecosystem. The GENIUS Act has paved the way for mass adoption, and we are in the infancy of what ETH can be used for in the future. The past decade has shown us that everything is going digital, and ETH could be the bridge to tokenizing asset markets and stablecoin issuance on ETH, which would encourage institutional adoption. Tom Lee has labeled ETH as the biggest macro trade over the next 10–15 years and believes that it could hit $25,000 per ETH by 2028. An investment in BMNR is very risky, but if mass adoption across decentralized finance platforms occurs, we could see ETH catch a large bid considering BTC is trading for around $118,000 and has limited utility compared to ETH. If this occurs, then there could be a lot of value to be unlocked in shares of BMNR as it is positioned to be the largest holder of ETH and should trade at a premium to its NAV, which could allow investors to experience large gains from buying ETH independently. I am purchasing BMNR as an indirect play on ETH, as I believe this strategy will generate substantial returns for shareholders over the next several years.",ETH-USD|BMNR,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-08-19 00:00:30

The filing , accepted by the SEC on August 15, 2025 under the registrant name Gemini Space Station, Inc., details the registration and supporting exhibits for the deal. The Role Of Ripple In Gemini’s IPO The core of the arrangement is straightforward: Ripple has committed a $75 million secured revolver to a Gemini financing vehicle, with room—subject to performance triggers—to rise to $150 million. The agreement allows borrowings above the base commitment to be funded not only in dollars but, at Gemini’s request and Ripple’s consent, “in the RLUSD equivalent of US Dollars,” explicitly defining RLUSD as Ripple’s US-dollar stablecoin. Minimum draw size is “at a minimum equivalent to $5,000,000,” and the document states for clarity, “For the avoidance of doubt, the Commitment shall not exceed $150,000,000.” Where the filing becomes market-relevant is less about the legal plumbing and more about IPO positioning. Gemini confirms it plans to list on Nasdaq under the ticker GEMI, with Goldman Sachs and Citigroup as lead bookrunners. Proceeds are earmarked for general corporate purposes and repayment of third-party debt—signals that the company is seeking balance-sheet flexibility rather than financing growth solely through equity. The S-1 paints a mixed operating picture heading into the roadshow. For the six months ended June 30, 2025, Gemini posted $68.6 million in revenue and a $282.5 million net loss—worse than the year-earlier period. Still, management is taking the company public into a friendlier tape for crypto listings, following debuts by Bullish and Circle . Broad reach remains a selling point: as of June 30, Gemini cites 14.6 million verified users and $12 billion in assets under custody. Strategically, the Ripple line reads as a liquidity shock-absorber for an issuer operating in a volatile asset class. It gives Gemini the option to tap a traditional dollar facility and, when capacity expands, to draw in RLUSD—folding a stablecoin rail directly into a regulated credit instrument. That is a distinctive pre-IPO narrative hook for investors comparing exchange models and treasury toolkits, especially as the filing positions GEMI alongside Coinbase and the recently listed Bullish as the cohort of US-traded exchanges grows. What’s next? Gemini has not disclosed deal size or pricing. Watch for the first amendment to the S-1 to set an initial range, updated financials, and any refinements to use-of-proceeds and risk disclosures. The SEC docket already shows the full exhibit list—including the Ripple credit agreement—under Accession No. 0001104659-25-079323, confirming the company’s path toward a Nasdaq debut as GEMI once market and regulatory conditions align.

XRP May Visit These Levels Of A Parallel Channel Next In an X post on Sunday, analyst Ali Martinez pointed out how XRP was at risk of observing a further drop if it couldn’t reclaim the $3.3 level. Below was the chart shared by the analyst. In the graph, Martinez highlighted a Parallel Channel that XRP has followed since late last year. A Parallel Channel is a TA pattern that forms whenever the price of an asset consolidates between two parallel trendlines. The upper line of the channel is likely to be a point of resistance, while the lower one that of support. A breakout of either of these bounds can trigger a continuation of the trend in that direction. Related Reading: Institutions Buying The Bitcoin Dip? Coinbase Premium Shoots Up From the chart, it’s visible that the asset slipped below the lower line of the Parallel Channel back in April, but this breakdown lasted only briefly, with the coin swiftly recovering back into the channel. Similarly, the cryptocurrency saw a breakout above the pattern last month, but once again the signal couldn’t sustain as its price returned below the upper line. Since then, XRP has made a couple of retests of this line situated at $3.3, but each attempt has been rejected. On Sunday, the analyst warned that the coin could face a further drawdown if it failed to recover to this level. Today, Martinez quoted the chart, noting that the asset has just lost another support level: $3. This line is located a quarter of the way down the Parallel Channel. Now, what could be next for XRP? According to the analyst, the coin may be heading to $2.6, corresponding to the midway line of the channel, or even $2, which represents its lower bound. These are just the support levels available to the cryptocurrency from a TA perspective. Another major support level could perhaps be hinted at by on-chain data, as Martinez shared in another X post. In the chart, the data for the recent Cost Basis Distribution of XRP is shown. According to this indicator, investors last accumulated around 1.7 million tokens of the cryptocurrency at the $2.81 level. Since the spot price is trading above this mark right now, these holders would be sitting on some gain. Generally, if the market mood is bullish, investors in profit react to retests of their cost basis by buying more. This is because they may look at the drawdown as just a ‘dip.’ Related Reading: Dogecoin Bullish Signal: Whales Buy 2 Billion DOGE The more concentrated a level is with supply, the stronger this reaction is. As such, the $2.81 level with its dense supply could play the role of a major support level for XRP in the event of a retrace to it. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is trading around $2.99, down over 6% in the last week.

Large holders appear focused on long-term positioning, even as retail traders react to price swings and short-term volatility. At the same time, large investors are quietly accumulating MAGACOIN FINANCE, an emerging altcoin analysts say every smart investor must have in their portfolio. This wave of accumulation highlights long-term conviction in leading assets, while retail traders remain cautious during periods of volatility. Ethereum Accumulation Despite Volatility Ethereum (ETH) continues to demonstrate why it is considered the backbone of the crypto market. While short-term volatility and liquidations can unsettle traders, the long-term trend remains positive. Institutions have steadily increased their exposure to Ethereum, with inflows into ETH-based products often surpassing Bitcoin’s. Large investors have also continued accumulating ETH, reinforcing confidence in its future growth. With Ethereum powering the majority of decentralized finance and maintaining the largest share of value locked, many analysts still view it as one of the best altcoins to buy now for long-term portfolios Solana Draws Institutional Inflows Solana (SOL) trades between $181–$195 after profit-taking, but whale and institutional buying continue. Solana continues to attract some of the largest institutional inflows in the altcoin market, with investment products tied to the network consistently ranking among the biggest weekly gainers. Solana continues to draw institutional attention, with new ETFs attracting fresh capital and major funds expanding their holdings. This steady inflow highlights growing confidence in Solana’s long-term role in both staking and DeFi. MAGACOIN FINANCE Picked as the Smart Investment MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining attention alongside Ethereum and Solana as whales and retail investors who are selling established tokens pick it as the next crypto market opportunity. Thousands of smart investors have already bought into the token ahead of the upcoming bull run. Analysts highlight MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the few new projects with structured token limits and growing investor accumulation. A limited-time 50% presale bonus with the code PATRIOT50X has fueled urgency, with investors aiming to secure positions before the token’s supply runs out. Analysts predict MAGACOIN FINANCE will outperform in 2025 and is definitely a must-have for every smart investor hoping to make massive returns. With both whales and smaller buyers active in the project, MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to draw attention as investors look for opportunities beyond established tokens. Conclusion Ethereum and Solana remain whale favorites, but MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly positioning itself as the best altcoin of 2025 , thanks to its capped supply, surging presale activity, and early investor bonuses. For those looking beyond the market’s short-term fear, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the standout choice for long-term growth.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index provides a unique snapshot of investor sentiment, acting as a vital barometer. Recently, this key indicator registered 56, firmly placing it in the ‘Greed’ zone despite a slight dip. What does this mean for you and your crypto journey? What Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Reveal? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , developed by software development platform Alternative, offers a clear numerical representation of market sentiment. It operates on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 signifies “Extreme Fear” and 100 denotes “Extreme Greed.” This index helps investors gauge whether the market is overly optimistic or excessively pessimistic, often serving as a contrarian indicator. When the index leans towards “Extreme Fear,” it might suggest a buying opportunity for brave investors. Conversely, an “Extreme Greed” reading could signal a potential market correction or an opportune time to consider profit-taking. It’s about understanding the crowd’s collective emotion. Decoding Current Crypto Fear & Greed Index Sentiment: Why 56 is Significant As of August 19, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index registered a value of 56. This marks a four-point decrease from the previous day, yet it comfortably remains within the “Greed” territory. A reading of 56 suggests that while some exuberance might have slightly receded, the overall market mood is still positive and confident. This sustained ‘Greed’ level indicates that investors are generally feeling optimistic about cryptocurrency prices. However, it’s a subtle reminder that sentiment can shift quickly. Monitoring these movements provides valuable insights into potential market directions and helps inform your strategy. How Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculate Sentiment? The index is not just a random number; it’s a sophisticated aggregation of several crucial market factors. Each factor contributes a specific weight to the final score, providing a comprehensive view of sentiment. Understanding these components is key to appreciating the index’s utility. Here are the primary factors influencing the Crypto Fear & Greed Index : Volatility (25%): Measures current Bitcoin volatility and maximum drawdowns compared to average values. Higher volatility often correlates with fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Analyzes current market volume and momentum compared to long-term averages. Strong buying volume indicates greed. Social Media (15%): Scans various social media platforms for crypto-related hashtags and analyzes the sentiment of posts. Increased positive mentions can indicate greed. Surveys (15%): Polls a large group of investors to gauge their sentiment directly. (Note: This component is currently paused). Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Assesses Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. A rising dominance can sometimes signal fear in altcoins, as investors flock to perceived safety. Google Trends (10%): Examines search query trends for crypto-related terms. Sudden increases in “Bitcoin price manipulation” searches, for example, could signal fear. Navigating Market Volatility with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index For both seasoned traders and new entrants, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a powerful tool for strategic decision-making. It’s not a buy or sell signal on its own, but rather a guide to understanding the prevailing emotional climate of the market. Using it wisely can help you avoid emotional pitfalls. Actionable Insights: Counter-Trade Opportunities: When the index hits “Extreme Fear,” consider it a potential opportunity to buy when others are panicking. Prudent Profit-Taking: If the index enters “Extreme Greed,” it might be a good time to consider taking some profits or re-evaluating your positions. Risk Management: Use the index to inform your overall risk appetite. High greed could mean higher risk of correction. However, remember that the index is just one tool. Always combine its insights with fundamental analysis, technical indicators, and your personal financial goals. The crypto market remains dynamic and unpredictable. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index provides a compelling window into the collective psyche of the crypto market. Its current reading of 56 in the ‘Greed’ zone highlights an ongoing optimistic sentiment, even with a slight reduction from previous days. By understanding its components and implications, investors can gain a crucial edge in navigating the volatile yet exciting world of digital assets. Stay informed, stay strategic, and let market sentiment guide, not dictate, your decisions. Frequently Asked Questions About the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Here are some common questions about this important market indicator: What does a high Crypto Fear & Greed Index score mean? A high score, typically above 50 and especially above 75, indicates “Greed” or “Extreme Greed.” This suggests that investors are feeling very optimistic and confident about the market, which can sometimes precede a price correction. Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index a reliable buy or sell signal? No, it’s not a direct buy or sell signal. Instead, it’s a sentiment indicator that helps you understand the prevailing emotional state of the market. Many traders use it as a contrarian tool: buying during extreme fear and considering selling during extreme greed. Which factors influence the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The index considers six main factors: volatility, market momentum/volume, social media sentiment, surveys (currently paused), Bitcoin dominance, and Google Trends data. Each factor contributes a specific weight to the overall score. How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? The index is updated daily by Alternative, providing a fresh snapshot of market sentiment for investors to consider. Can I use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index for altcoins? While the index is primarily focused on Bitcoin, as Bitcoin’s dominance is a factor, its general sentiment often reflects the broader cryptocurrency market. However, specific altcoin projects may have their own unique sentiment drivers. Found this analysis of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index insightful?

50309625,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=787207,1755563335,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50309625.jpeg,Starling bank snaps up accounting startup to power SME tax tools,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/starling-bank-snaps-up-accounting-startup/,"Starling Bank has acquired British accounting software startup Ember, aiming to strengthen its suite of services for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The challenger bank plans to offer business clients integrated tax and bookkeeping tools alongside its core banking products. The deal’s financial terms were not disclosed, though sources familiar with the transaction said it was valued at under £10 million (around $13.5 million). Declan Ferguson, Starling’s chief financial officer, described the acquisition as a natural extension of the bank’s existing offerings. He noted that combining invoicing, accounting, and tax software with traditional banking services like loans and credit facilities made strategic sense. Starling braces for new era of tax rules Mergers are crucial for small businesses and self-employed workers in Britain. From next year, HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) will implement new rules forcing about 780,000 sole traders and landlords to update the taxman on their income and expenses every three months rather than annually. The move is part of the government’s Making Tax Digital project. For a small business owner, the pressure to comply will also increase with these new, quarterly filings. By embedding Ember’s tools, Starling aims to make tax compliance painless for its close to 500,000 small business customers. The financial firm’s small-business portfolio has expanded rapidly in recent years. The bank was among the most active lenders under the government-backed schemes to support business through the pandemic, allowing it to develop close ties with small companies and entrepreneurs up and down the country. Ember, founded in 2019, marketed itself as a modern, digital-first accounting platform. It enables entrepreneurs to automate bookkeeping, keep up-to-date with expenses, and handle taxes on a mobile-friendly interface. Last year, the company also raised £5 million via funding led by Valar Ventures — the venture capital firm funded by Peter Thiel and Shapers. Previously, Ember has worked with heavyweights including HSBC, Revolut, Barclays, and Lloyds in banking to provide integrated accounting functionality. These partnerships will, however, phase out by 2026, as Ember becomes part of Starling’s ecosystem. The startup will cease its accounting advisory services as part of the acquisition. There will be the opportunity for around 30 Ember employees to join the financial firm, providing continuity in knowledge. Co-founders Daniel Hogan and Aaron Shaw will join the bank and drive integration. The deal will close Ember’s time as an independent entity, but its technology will now be able to cater to a much broader range of SMEs via Starling’s banking infrastructure. Starling soldiers on despite regulatory setbacks The deal comes at a difficult time for Starling. The bank was fined £29m by regulators in October last year for what was described as “shockingly lax” controls over high-risk customers between September 2011 and November 2013. Certainly, Starling is operating under an FCA voluntary restriction. This action prevents the bank from bringing on certain types of customers until it fixes deficiencies in its compliance systems. Even so, Starling has pursued further products and tech investment. Outside the UK, Starling was said to be eyeing international expansion. Bloomberg reported in June that the bank was considering the purchase of a nationally chartered bank in the United States. It was also reported that Starling had entered talks to hire senior US bankers during the summer to advise on the process, although the bank declined to comment. The lender’s chief financial officer, Declan Ferguson, noted that there was a real opportunity to establish a regulated business model in the US. Starling puts itself out as more than just a digital bank by taking hold of Ember. It’s evolving into a hub for small businesses requiring banking, accounting, and tax services on one platform. The move indicates Starling’s ambition to take on high street banks and fintech competitors such as Tide and Revolut, which are extending their SME offerings. The merger, for small businesses that already were navigating tighter rules, more reporting requirements, and surging costs, could mean simplicity at last.

Recently, the South Korean internet giant Naver made headlines with a significant financial move concerning its WEMIX tokens , highlighting the volatile nature of the crypto market. This event serves as a crucial reminder that even established corporations face unique risks when engaging with cryptocurrencies. What Exactly Happened with Naver’s WEMIX Tokens ? Naver, a household name in South Korea’s tech landscape, has officially written off its holdings of WEMIX tokens . This wasn’t a small adjustment; the company recorded a full impairment of 866,700 WEMIX, which translates to approximately $2.4 million. This substantial write-off occurred in the first half of this year, signaling a notable financial decision. An impairment, in accounting terms, means that the book value of an asset is reduced because its market value has declined below its carrying value. Essentially, Naver acknowledges that its investment in these WEMIX tokens is no longer worth what it initially paid. Why Did Naver Hold WEMIX Tokens in the First Place? Many might wonder why an internet giant like Naver would possess a significant amount of WEMIX tokens . The answer lies in a strategic partnership established back in 2020. Naver acquired these tokens as part of an agreement that designated it a WEMIX Block Partner. This collaboration aimed to explore the potential of blockchain technology and its integration into Naver’s vast ecosystem. Such partnerships are common in the crypto space, where traditional companies seek to leverage decentralized technologies for new services or enhanced user experiences. Therefore, Naver’s initial acquisition of WEMIX tokens was a strategic investment, not merely a speculative one. What Does This Mean for the Future of WEMIX Tokens and the Crypto Market? Naver’s decision to impair its WEMIX tokens after nearly five years raises important questions for the broader digital asset landscape. While specific reasons for the impairment haven’t been fully detailed beyond the financial accounting, it underscores the inherent risks associated with holding volatile cryptocurrencies. For investors and developers in the WEMIX ecosystem, this news serves as a reminder of market fluctuations and corporate strategy shifts. It highlights that even long-term holdings by major entities are subject to re-evaluation based on performance and market conditions. Consequently, the impairment could influence investor sentiment around similar blockchain-based gaming and platform tokens. Lessons Learned from Naver’s WEMIX Tokens Experience This event offers several key takeaways for anyone involved in the crypto space, whether you’re an individual investor or a large corporation considering digital asset integration: Due Diligence is Crucial: Before engaging with any digital asset, thorough research into its fundamentals, team, and market viability is essential. Understanding the project’s long-term vision and potential pitfalls can prevent costly write-offs like those involving WEMIX tokens . Risk Management: Companies and individuals holding cryptocurrencies must have clear strategies for managing potential losses, including impairment policies and diversification. Setting clear entry and exit points is vital. Long-Term Vision vs. Volatility: Even strategic partnerships involving WEMIX tokens or other digital assets can face challenges due to market volatility or evolving business priorities. What seems promising today might require re-evaluation tomorrow. Transparency: Financial reporting like Naver’s impairment provides valuable transparency into corporate crypto holdings, which can influence market sentiment and inform future investment decisions. Naver’s $2.4 million impairment on its WEMIX tokens serves as a powerful illustration of the dynamic and sometimes unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. It highlights that even major corporations are not immune to the financial adjustments required when digital asset values shift. As the crypto world continues to evolve, such events reinforce the importance of cautious investment and robust risk assessment. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What are WEMIX tokens? WEMIX tokens are the native cryptocurrency of the WEMIX platform, a blockchain-based gaming and entertainment ecosystem developed by Wemade. They are used for transactions, governance, and rewards within the ecosystem. 2. Why did Naver acquire WEMIX tokens? Naver acquired WEMIX tokens in 2020 as part of a strategic partnership agreement. This made Naver a WEMIX Block Partner, aiming to explore and integrate blockchain technology into its services. 3. What does “impairment” mean in this context? In accounting, an impairment means that the value of an asset on a company’s balance sheet has decreased below its original cost. Naver’s impairment of WEMIX tokens signifies that the company has reduced the recorded value of its holdings to reflect a decline in their market price. 4. Does this impairment affect the WEMIX platform directly? While Naver’s impairment is a financial decision by one of its partners, it does not directly impact the operational functionality of the WEMIX platform. However, such news from a prominent partner can influence market sentiment and investor confidence in WEMIX tokens. 5. What can we learn from Naver’s decision regarding WEMIX tokens? This event underscores the volatility and risks inherent in cryptocurrency investments, even for large corporations. It highlights the importance of thorough due diligence, robust risk management strategies, and transparency in reporting digital asset holdings.

What Exactly Happened with This Large ETH Withdrawal? In the early hours, a fresh, previously inactive digital wallet initiated and completed a significant transaction. This wallet pulled 15,752 Ethereum tokens directly from FalconX, a prime broker for institutional digital asset trading. The sheer volume of ETH involved, equating to tens of millions of dollars, immediately caught the attention of on-chain analytics platforms, including Onchain Lens, which quickly disseminated the information. Transaction Details: 15,752 ETH moved. Value: Approximately $68.24 million at the time of withdrawal. Origin: FalconX, a well-known institutional trading platform. Destination: A newly created, unidentified wallet. This kind of large ETH withdrawal is not an everyday occurrence. It raises questions about the identity of the recipient and the underlying reasons for such a substantial transfer. Why Does a Massive ETH Withdrawal from FalconX Matter? Understanding the implications of this large ETH withdrawal is crucial for anyone following the crypto market. When institutional platforms like FalconX see such considerable outflows, it can suggest several possibilities, each with different potential impacts: Institutional Reallocation: A large entity, such as a hedge fund or an investment firm, might be moving assets to a different custody solution, preparing for an over-the-counter (OTC) trade, or shifting capital between strategies. This often happens quietly and is part of routine asset management. Security Concerns: While less common for established platforms, sometimes large withdrawals can occur if an entity is moving funds due to perceived security risks or a desire for greater self-custody. However, FalconX is generally considered a secure platform. Market Speculation: The movement could precede a significant market event, such as a large sell-off or a strategic accumulation. Traders often interpret such movements as signals, though correlation does not always imply causation. The lack of immediate public information about the wallet’s owner adds to the intrigue, prompting analysts to delve deeper into the on-chain data for clues. What Are the Potential Market Implications of This ETH Movement? A large ETH withdrawal of this magnitude naturally leads to speculation about its potential impact on Ethereum’s price and broader market sentiment. While one single transaction, even a large one, rarely dictates market trends, it can contribute to a narrative or confirm existing suspicions. For instance, if the funds are being moved to a self-custody wallet with no immediate intent to sell, the impact might be minimal. Conversely, if the wallet is linked to an exchange or a known over-the-counter desk, it could signal an impending large sell order, which might exert downward pressure on ETH’s price. However, it’s equally possible that the funds are being prepared for staking, DeFi participation, or entry into new institutional products. Key Takeaways for Investors: Stay Informed: Monitor on-chain analytics for further movements from this wallet. Avoid Panic: Do not make rash decisions based on a single transaction. Evaluate the broader market context. Diversify: Large individual transactions highlight the volatility and unique dynamics of the crypto market. The crypto community will undoubtedly be watching this wallet closely for any subsequent movements that might reveal its purpose. This event underscores the transparency of blockchain technology, where every significant transaction is publicly visible, even if the parties involved remain anonymous. In conclusion, the recent large ETH withdrawal of $68.24 million from FalconX by a new wallet is a significant on-chain event that demands attention. While the precise reasons remain speculative, such movements are integral to understanding the flow of institutional capital within the crypto ecosystem. Whether it signifies a strategic repositioning, a security measure, or a precursor to market action, its sheer scale makes it a key data point for analysts and investors alike. Keeping an eye on subsequent movements from this wallet will provide further clarity on its ultimate intent and potential market ramifications. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is FalconX? FalconX is a cryptocurrency prime broker that offers institutional investors and trading firms a comprehensive suite of services, including trading, credit, and clearing, for digital assets. It facilitates large-volume transactions for professional clients. Q2: Why is a “newly generated wallet” significant? A newly generated wallet often means it’s a fresh address created specifically for this transaction or for a new entity. It makes it harder to immediately identify the owner compared to movements from known exchange wallets or long-standing institutional addresses. Q3: Could this large ETH withdrawal impact Ethereum’s price? While a single transaction of this size can cause short-term speculation, its long-term impact on Ethereum’s price depends on the ultimate intent of the funds. If they are moved for selling, it could create downward pressure; if for holding, staking, or new products, the impact might be neutral or even positive in the long run. Q4: How can I track such large crypto movements? You can track large crypto movements using on-chain analytics platforms like Etherscan, Arkham Intelligence, or services like Onchain Lens, which monitor and report significant transactions across various blockchains.

Recently, the Altcoin Season Index, a key metric tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), registered 43. This specific reading at 00:27 UTC on August 19, a five-point drop from the previous day, clearly indicates that the market is currently in a Bitcoin Season . But what exactly does this mean for your crypto portfolio? What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? To truly grasp the current market dynamics, it’s essential to understand the Altcoin Season Index. This valuable metric, provided by CoinMarketCap, helps investors gauge whether altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin or vice versa. It specifically excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens, focusing on the pure performance of independent cryptocurrencies. Here’s how it works: The index compares the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin over the past 90 days. For a market to be in an Altcoin Season, a significant majority—at least 75%—of these top 100 altcoins must have outperformed Bitcoin. Conversely, a Bitcoin Season is declared when 25% or fewer of these altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin. The index scores range from 1 to 100, with lower scores indicating a stronger Bitcoin Season. A score of 43, as we’ve seen, firmly places us in this phase. Understanding this index is vital for strategic investment decisions, especially during a pronounced Bitcoin Season . Why Are We in Bitcoin Season Right Now? The current Altcoin Season Index reading of 43 signals a strong period of Bitcoin Season . This trend often emerges when investors gravitate towards Bitcoin, the largest and most established cryptocurrency, as a perceived safe haven or a primary growth driver. Several factors can contribute to this shift: Market Uncertainty: During periods of broader economic or crypto market uncertainty, investors often de-risk by moving funds from more volatile altcoins into Bitcoin. Its larger market capitalization and longer track record offer a sense of stability. Dominance Resurgence: Bitcoin’s dominance, which is its market cap share relative to the total crypto market, tends to increase during these periods. This means a larger portion of new money flowing into crypto goes directly into Bitcoin. Pre-Halving Cycles: Historically, Bitcoin often sees strong performance leading up to its halving events, drawing capital away from altcoins. Institutional Interest: Increased institutional adoption or major positive news specifically related to Bitcoin can also lead to a Bitcoin Season , as large players primarily focus on BTC. The recent drop in the index score from 48 to 43 within a day underscores the rapid shift towards Bitcoin’s dominance, making it a critical time to observe market movements. Navigating the Bitcoin Season: What Does This Mean for Investors? For many crypto enthusiasts, a clear Bitcoin Season presents both opportunities and challenges. It requires a nuanced approach to portfolio management: Focus on Bitcoin: During this period, Bitcoin often offers more stable gains compared to altcoins. Investors might consider increasing their BTC holdings or rebalancing their portfolios to reflect Bitcoin’s stronger performance. Altcoin Caution: While some altcoins might still perform well, the overall trend suggests that a majority will struggle to keep pace with Bitcoin. This doesn’t mean avoiding altcoins entirely, but rather being more selective and cautious. Risk Management: It’s a good time to review your risk exposure. High-cap altcoins might be more resilient than smaller, more speculative ones. Diversification within altcoins, if you choose to hold them, remains important. Market Reassessment: Use this period to research potential altcoins for the next Altcoin Season. Projects with strong fundamentals and innovative technology might be good long-term holds, even if they are underperforming Bitcoin currently. Ultimately, understanding the market’s current phase, especially during a strong Bitcoin Season , empowers investors to make informed decisions and adapt their strategies accordingly. In conclusion, the Altcoin Season Index at 43 unequivocally points to a prevailing Bitcoin Season . This signifies a period where Bitcoin is largely outperforming the broader altcoin market, driven by various market dynamics and investor sentiment. By staying informed about these cycles and adjusting your strategy, you can navigate the crypto landscape more effectively. The crypto market is dynamic, and understanding these shifts is paramount for success. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index is a metric that tracks whether altcoins (cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin) are outperforming Bitcoin. It compares the performance of the top 100 coins over the past 90 days, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens. Q2: How is a Bitcoin Season determined? A Bitcoin Season occurs when 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. The Altcoin Season Index will typically be low, often below 50, during this period. Q3: What does an Altcoin Season Index of 43 signify? An Altcoin Season Index of 43 strongly indicates that the market is currently in a Bitcoin Season . This means Bitcoin is generally performing better than most altcoins, and investor focus has shifted towards BTC. Q4: How should investors adjust their strategy during Bitcoin Season? During a Bitcoin Season , investors might consider increasing their exposure to Bitcoin, being more selective with altcoin investments, and focusing on risk management. It’s a good time to re-evaluate portfolios and potentially rebalance towards BTC dominance. Q5: Does Bitcoin Season mean altcoins will never perform well? No, a Bitcoin Season doesn’t mean altcoins will never perform well. It signifies a current market trend. Altcoins can still see individual pumps or perform well in specific niches, but the broader market trend favors Bitcoin’s outperformance. Market cycles change, and an Altcoin Season may follow.

Ethereum and Chainlink whales have been diversifying into smaller projects while keeping core positions intact. Avalanche whales are also joining this move, signaling a wider trend across altcoins. Analysts note that MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the standout presale, drawing strong interest during this rotation. Whale Rotation Strengthens Presale Demand Over $1.4 billion has been rotated by whales in the past week. Most of this capital still sits in Ethereum, Avalanche, and Chainlink. However, a growing share is now moving into early-stage projects with higher upside. MAGACOIN FINANCE is at the center of this trend. The strategy looks clear. Whales build stability with ETH and AVAX, then use a portion of those gains to target faster growth plays. By spreading risk, they balance safety with exponential upside. This approach explains why MAGACOIN is gaining momentum so quickly. MAGACOIN FINANCE Presale Momentum Builds Early adopters are rushing in as MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a 50% EXTRA BONUS with the code PATRIOT50X, fueling presale momentum. This has created a wave of new attention from both retail investors and whales. Analysts point to MAGACOIN’s strong foundation. The project is built on Ethereum and integrates DeFi staking features. Its smart contract has been certified and is undergoing further audits. These factors make it appealing to conservative whales who want safety, as well as growth-focused investors chasing upside. The demand for Ethereum-based assets has risen due to ETF-driven adoption. This has tightened exchange supply and increased institutional holdings. Since MAGACOIN aligns directly with Ethereum’s ecosystem, it stands to benefit from this growing demand. Projections suggest gains of 43x to 70x, depending on exchange listings and market momentum. Altcoin Cycle Setup This whale rotation is part of a larger altcoin cycle. When blue-chip assets like ETH, AVAX, and LINK rally, whales often recycle profits into new tokens. It allows them to stay ahead of the next breakout. With MAGACOIN positioned as a smaller cap, it fits this pattern perfectly. Whales see it as a chance to ride the next wave before it hits major exchanges. Final Thoughts The trend is clear. Whales are keeping core positions in ETH and LINK while directing fresh capital into MAGACOIN. Avalanche investors are following the same path. With strong fundamentals, presale demand, and whale backing, MAGACOIN FINANCE looks like one of the best crypto presale opportunities in 2025.

50310510,559132,1755565217,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50310510.jpeg,Crypto Funds See $3.75B Weekly Surge – Ethereum Claims 77% of It,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-funds-see-3-75b-weekly-ethereum-77-of-it/,"Global crypto asset investment products saw a significant rebound in investor interest last week, with inflows totaling $3.75 billion, according to CoinShares’ latest fund flows report . The figure marks the fourth-largest weekly inflow on record, highlighting renewed activity following several weeks of muted sentiment across the sector. James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, noted that inflows were heavily concentrated: “Unusually, almost all inflows were directed into a single provider, iShares, and one specific investment product. Following recent price gains, total assets under management reached an all-time high of $244 billion on August 13.” While inflows were widespread across multiple digital assets, Ethereum stood out as the dominant contributor, far surpassing Bitcoin in both weekly and year-to-date (YTD) commitments. Ethereum Leads with Record Inflows Ethereum investment products attracted $2.87 billion last week, accounting for roughly 77% of all inflows during the period. This performance brought Ethereum’s YTD inflows to $11 billion, setting a record and underscoring its growing role in institutional portfolios . The scale of capital moving into Ethereum also meant that, relative to assets under management, inflows represented 29% of total Ethereum AuM, compared with Bitcoin’s 11.6%. By comparison, Bitcoin products recorded $552 million in inflows during the week. Although still a substantial figure, it lagged considerably behind Ethereum. Other altcoins also attracted investor attention, with Solana seeing $176.5 million and XRP recording $125.9 million in inflows. Conversely, some assets experienced outflows : Litecoin lost $400,000, while Toncoin saw $1 million withdrawn. The report emphasized that the surge in Ethereum inflows occurred against a backdrop of elevated trading volumes and price strength, bringing ETH close to its historical highs. It is suggested that the concentration of inflows into Ethereum could reflect growing confidence in its evolving role as the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi) and broader blockchain applications . Regional Breakdown and Market Context Geographically, the United States accounted for 99% of all inflows, totaling $3.73 billion. Other markets recorded modest figures: Canada registered $33.7 million, Hong Kong added $20.9 million, and Australia saw $12.1 million. On the other hand, Brazil and Sweden bucked the trend, recording outflows of $10.6 million and $49.9 million, respectively. The heavy US concentration highlights the ongoing dominance of North American institutions in driving digital asset fund flows. Butterfill as aforementioned already pointed out that while the strong inflow numbers are encouraging, the unusual concentration into a single provider highlights the uneven distribution of institutional demand across the sector. Looking ahead, it should be worth monitoring whether Ethereum can sustain this momentum and whether Bitcoin inflows begin to catch up. The record growth in total assets under management across crypto investment products suggests that despite recent volatility, institutional interest in digital assets continues to expand.

Long-Term Holders Send Mixed Signals,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/is-bitcoin-bull-run-nearing-its-end-long-term-holders-send-mixed-signals/,"Bitcoin’s momentum has slowed after reaching a new all-time high above $124,000 last week. The cryptocurrency has since moved lower, with its price slipping by nearly 10% from that peak. At the time of writing, BTC is trading around $115,424, reflecting a 2.5% decline in the past 24 hours. The retracement has drawn attention to on-chain activity and investor behavior, particularly among long-term holders (LTHs). A CryptoQuant analyst has been monitoring realized profit and loss metrics to gauge whether the current cycle is approaching its peak or if more upside potential remains. Data released by the analyst sheds light on how seasoned holders are reacting to Bitcoin’s latest rally. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulls Must Survive Brutal September Before Q4 Hope, Analyst Predicts Long-Term Holder Trends Across Market Cycles CryptoQuant contributor PelinayPA shared an assessment of Bitcoin’s long-term holder realized profit and loss (RPL) metric, which tracks when investors who have held coins for extended periods decide to sell. According to the analyst, this indicator has historically been reliable in signaling both cycle tops and bottoms. The analysis highlights key phases across multiple market cycles. During the 2017 bull market, a surge in LTH realized profits coincided with Bitcoin’s peak. By contrast, in the 2018–2019 bear market, profit realization slowed dramatically, while losses surfaced, reflecting the market bottom. A similar pattern was observed in 2021, though the profit realization was more gradual, suggesting that selling pressure was spread across the market rather than concentrated in short bursts. When Bitcoin entered the 2022–2023 downturn, realized losses increased significantly as the asset fell into the $15,000–$20,000 range. That period was characterized by panic selling among longer-term holders. In the current market, however, PelinayPA notes that while profit-taking is visible, it remains moderate compared with past peaks. This indicates that, although selling is occurring, it has not yet reached the levels typically associated with a cycle top. What the Current Data Suggests for Bitcoin The current phase of moderate profit realization suggests caution but does not confirm that Bitcoin has fully topped out. PelinayPA explained that: Historically, sharp increases in LTH profit realization (large green spikes) align with bull market tops. Current selling (mid-2025) is measured and gradual, which implies BTC may still be in the late stages of a bull cycle. If LTH selling accelerates, it could mark the next peak. This measured approach by long-term holders could mean that the market retains some room for additional upward movement, provided selling pressure does not intensify. At the same time, the data highlights that a shift toward heavier profit-taking would be an important warning signal for traders and institutions watching the market closely. Related Reading: Bitcoin 30-Day CDD Down: Market Absorbs LTH Selling Without Breaking Support On-chain analytics firms frequently point to these long-term holder behaviors as leading indicators. While Bitcoin’s price action continues to consolidate below its record high, how these investors act in the coming weeks could set the tone for the next stage of the cycle. For now, the data suggests that the rally has not yet reached conditions historically associated with a definitive top, but market participants are advised to watch profit realization closely.

He emphasized Ripple’s banking charter application and substantial XRP holdings as factors that could position the company among the world’s top financial institutions. SWIFT Faces Potential Strain Gilbertie raised concerns about the long-term stability of SWIFT, the decades-old system that enables banks to transmit cross-border payment messages. During an interview on the Paul Barron Show, he indicated that the network could experience significant disruption shortly. According to Gilbertie, Ripple’s technological infrastructure, coupled with its move toward a banking license , could allow it to assume a dominant role in international finance. He highlighted Ripple’s holdings of approximately 40 billion XRP tokens and speculated that if the company secures a banking charter, it could utilize these assets to become one of the largest capitalized banks globally. The CEO underscored that such a shift could introduce efficiencies currently absent in traditional banking systems, including eliminating the need for pre-funding accounts in both sending and receiving countries for cross-border transfers. Blockchain Efficiency and Market Impact He further emphasized the operational advantages blockchain offers for international banking. He suggested that Ripple’s ledger system could unlock significant liquidity currently tied up in banks’ balance sheets. By moving transactions from SWIFT to a blockchain-based network, banks could potentially streamline payments, reduce costs, and improve transparency. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 He noted that as global financial standards such as ISO 20022 are adopted, Ripple’s network may handle an increasing share of cross-border transaction volume, challenging SWIFT’s longstanding dominance. He indicated that early adopters would likely begin public reporting of transaction volumes conducted via blockchain, which could highlight the growing role of distributed ledger technology in financial markets. He also discussed the evolving regulatory landscape for XRP. He predicted that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might approve spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) before the end of the year. His firm previously launched the first leveraged XRP ETF in the United States in April, reflecting growing institutional interest in the digital asset. Market Performance and Short-Term Challenges Despite these positive projections, XRP has experienced recent market volatility. As of August 18, the token traded just below $3.00, but quickly rebounded to $3.06, marking a 3.91% decline over the past week. Analysts have indicated that XRP’s near-term performance will depend on maintaining key technical support levels. Failure to surpass resistance at $3.30 could expose the token to further declines, while preserving support at $2.81 is critical to sustaining its bullish outlook. While currently trading below its July peak of $3.65, XRP remains up more than 430% year-on-year, reflecting strong performance relative to broader market trends. Gilbertie’s perspective highlights the potential for Ripple and XRP to reshape cross-border payments, though near-term price fluctuations continue to present risks for investors.

U.S. President Donald Trump signed the crypto legislation into law last month, much to the appeasement of key players in the blockchain sector . “Let me say, the entire crypto community, for years you were mocked and dismissed and counted out,” the president continued. “You were counted out as little as a year and a half ago—but this signing is a massive validation.” The move reinforces that the GENIUS Act isn’t just symbolic — it’s now becoming the framework for America’s digital asset strategy .

This funding will come through an offering of 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2031, with the primary goal of accelerating its TeraWulf Expansion strategy. This financial maneuver aims to bolster the company’s data center capabilities and support general corporate purposes, as detailed in a Globe Newswire press release. What Does This TeraWulf Expansion Entail? This massive capital injection is not just about growing; it’s about strategic positioning within the competitive Bitcoin mining landscape. TeraWulf’s decision to issue convertible notes highlights a clear intent to scale operations significantly. But what exactly are these notes, and why are they a preferred funding method? Convertible Senior Notes: These are a type of debt instrument that can be converted into a specified number of common shares of the issuing company under certain conditions. For investors, they offer the security of a bond (fixed interest payments) combined with the potential upside of equity (conversion to shares if the stock performs well). Purpose of Funds: The proceeds are earmarked for two critical areas: enhancing data center infrastructure and covering general corporate expenses. This dual focus ensures both physical growth and operational stability. The company is clearly setting its sights on a larger footprint, aiming to capture more of the Bitcoin mining market share. Why is Data Center Expansion Crucial for Bitcoin Mining? For a Bitcoin mining operation like TeraWulf, data centers are the beating heart of their business. These facilities house the powerful mining rigs that solve complex computational puzzles to validate transactions and earn new Bitcoin. Therefore, expanding these centers directly translates to increased mining capacity and and, potentially, higher revenue. The significance of this TeraWulf Expansion can be understood through several lenses: Increased Hash Rate: More data center capacity means more mining rigs can be deployed, leading to a higher ‘hash rate’ – the total computational power used for mining. A higher hash rate improves the chances of solving blocks and earning Bitcoin rewards. Operational Efficiency: Larger, purpose-built data centers often allow for better cooling, more efficient power distribution, and optimized maintenance, all of which reduce operational costs per Bitcoin mined. Strategic Advantage: In a volatile market, companies with robust infrastructure are better positioned to weather price fluctuations and capitalize on favorable conditions. This investment signals TeraWulf’s long-term commitment and confidence in the Bitcoin ecosystem. This move is a strong indicator of TeraWulf’s confidence in the future profitability of Bitcoin mining, even amidst market fluctuations. What Are the Implications of This $850M Raise? Raising such a substantial amount through convertible notes has several implications for TeraWulf, its investors, and the broader Bitcoin mining industry. It demonstrates the company’s ability to attract significant institutional capital, a testament to its perceived growth potential and operational strength. For investors, the 1.00% interest rate offers a steady return, while the conversion feature provides an opportunity to participate in potential equity appreciation. However, it also introduces dilution risk if the notes are converted into shares, which could impact existing shareholders. The successful execution of this TeraWulf Expansion could: Boost Market Position: Solidify TeraWulf’s standing as a major player in the North American Bitcoin mining scene. Enhance Competitiveness: Allow the company to deploy cutting-edge hardware and optimize energy sources, potentially lowering its cost of production. Signal Industry Confidence: Large capital raises like this can inspire confidence across the entire Bitcoin mining sector, suggesting a positive outlook for the industry’s future. This funding round is a clear signal that TeraWulf is gearing up for a significant leap forward. Looking Ahead: The Future of TeraWulf’s Operations The coming years will reveal the full impact of this ambitious funding initiative. TeraWulf’s ability to effectively deploy this capital into state-of-the-art data centers and optimize its operations will be key to its success. The focus on general corporate purposes also suggests a holistic approach to growth, ensuring that all facets of the business are prepared for expansion. As the Bitcoin halving events continue to reduce block rewards, efficiency and scale become paramount for miners. This TeraWulf Expansion positions the company to remain competitive and sustainable in an evolving landscape. Investors and industry observers will be closely watching how TeraWulf leverages these funds to achieve its strategic objectives and contribute to the overall stability and growth of the Bitcoin network. This bold step underscores TeraWulf’s commitment to long-term growth and its belief in the enduring value of Bitcoin mining. Summary: TeraWulf’s Strategic Growth TeraWulf’s announcement to raise $850 million via convertible senior notes marks a pivotal moment for the company. This substantial capital infusion is specifically designed to fuel significant data center expansion and support broader corporate objectives. By strengthening its infrastructure and increasing its mining capacity, TeraWulf aims to solidify its position as a leading Bitcoin miner. This strategic financial move not only reflects the company’s confidence in its future but also highlights the ongoing growth and investment within the digital asset mining sector. It’s an exciting development for both TeraWulf and the wider crypto community. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are convertible senior notes? Convertible senior notes are a type of debt security that pays interest like a bond but can be converted into shares of the issuing company’s common stock under certain conditions, offering investors both income and potential equity upside. Why is TeraWulf raising $850 million? TeraWulf is raising $850 million primarily to fund its data center expansion, which will increase its Bitcoin mining capacity and efficiency. The funds will also be used for general corporate purposes to support overall business growth. How will this expansion impact TeraWulf’s Bitcoin mining operations? The TeraWulf Expansion is expected to significantly increase the company’s hash rate, allowing it to mine more Bitcoin. It should also improve operational efficiency through better infrastructure, potentially reducing costs and enhancing profitability. What are the potential risks for investors in these notes? While convertible notes offer interest payments, potential risks include market volatility affecting the stock price (which impacts conversion value), the company’s ability to execute its expansion plans, and potential dilution for existing shareholders if the notes are converted. Where will TeraWulf’s new data centers be located? While the press release mentions general data center expansion, specific new locations are typically disclosed by the company as part of their detailed expansion plans or quarterly reports. This announcement focuses on the funding mechanism. Did you find this article insightful?

The regulatory agency aims to take cautionary measures before allowing new ETF products to exist in the country. This announcement was made public after the SEC highlighted that it had extended its decision on the 21Shares Core XRP Trust from the set deadline of August 20, adding 60 days, setting the new deadline for October 19. The delay will provide the regulatory agency ample time to seek public opinion on the proposal and assess any regulatory concerns associated with the Exchange Act, typically known as the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The 21Shares Trust initially filed its proposal on February 6, followed by an updated Amendment No. 1 submission on February 12. If the SEC ultimately disapproves of the 21Shares application after the October 19 deadline, it would represent a significant setback in the regulator’s legal review process for this product. The SEC delays making a decision on XRP ETF proposals Like the 21Shares XRP ETF proposal, the SEC has postponed its decisions on Grayscale, CoinShares, and Bitwise XRP ETF filings. The regulator’s new deadline for all these proposals remains October 19, with analysts anticipating the agency may handle them consistent with previous Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF reviews. If this expectation holds, the SEC could issue final decisions on all eight pending spot ETF applications—including Franklin Templeton , REX-Osprey, WisdomTree, and five others—by October 18, the initial final deadline set for these unsettled funds. Speculation also suggests that multiple ETFs, including Solana-based funds, could launch simultaneously, as the SEC has extended its review for Solana ETFs to align with the October deadline. Despite the optimism that a decision will be made soon, BlackRock, the biggest asset manager in the world, announced just recently that it will not apply for an XRP ETF. Other pending applications for cryptocurrencies include Cardano, Hedera, Litecoin, Avalanche, Dogecoin, and PENGU. The SEC extends review of altcoin ETFs A similar approach was applied to several altcoin ETFs and various filings, according to reports from a reliable source, the SEC had extended the deadline for its review period for Truth Social’s Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF. These funds are not the only funds that will expose investors to Bitcoin and Ethereum because the agency had earlier approved Hashdex and Franklin Templeton’s funds, which have similar functions. In addition, before the August 24 deadline, the agency had earlier delayed its decision on the CoinShares Litecoin ETF. Considering the above Scenario, October 23 seems to be the final deadline for the SEC to decide whether to approve or disapprove this fund. Canary Capital and Grayscale are among the firms that have submitted an LTC ETF application. The deadline will also feature the regulatory body’s decision on staking for the 21Shares Ethereum ETF and Grayscale’s Dogecoin ETF. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

In 2021 it was Shiba Inu (SHIB), turning small investments into fortunes. Now, in August 2025, analysts are drawing parallels between SHIB’s legendary run and the rise of MAGACOIN FINANCE. With forecasts projecting up to 18,000% upside, and viral meme momentum colliding with structured tokenomics, early adopters see this as one of the rare chances to ride a new retail wave before allocations vanish. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Why Analysts Are Watching MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly become one of the year’s most talked-about presale tokens. Its appeal lies in the combination of meme-driven virality and scarcity-focused design — two traits that have historically defined breakout tokens. Analysts say MAGACOIN is “engineered” for the kind of exponential growth that could define the 2025 bull cycle, much like SHIB did four years ago. With entry prices still below $0.01, MAGACOIN is being framed as a ground-floor opportunity. Several projection models peg the token at potential multiples of 18,000%, depending on adoption, liquidity at listing, and how aggressively retail and whales pile in once the token goes live. Why the SHIB Comparison Matters The comparison to SHIB isn’t made lightly. SHIB’s early holders enjoyed a 100,000%+ run as the coin went from obscurity to global headlines, fueled entirely by community-driven hype. Analysts argue MAGACOIN FINANCE is in a similar position today — leveraging its political branding, viral marketing, and presale buzz to ignite a massive FOMO loop. If momentum continues, $1,000 invested during the presale could, in bullish scenarios, return $18,000 or more. While not every forecast is this extreme, the alignment of whale interest, retail excitement, and cultural virality makes the SHIB comparison a powerful narrative that’s already spreading across Telegram groups and trading forums. Market Catalysts Driving the Buzz Three factors stand out in MAGACOIN FINANCE’s case: Presale Positioning: Tokens are still cheap, and allocations are disappearing quickly. Investors who remember SHIB’s earliest stages say MAGACOIN’s current entry levels feel “pre-hype,” offering asymmetric upside. Viral Branding: MAGACOIN leans heavily into politics-meets-finance messaging, a cultural narrative that resonates strongly with online communities. This gives it a marketing edge over purely speculative meme tokens. Whale and Retail Convergence: Both whales and grassroots buyers are piling in, creating a unique mix of large-ticket confidence and small-investor excitement. This dual momentum has historically been critical for breakout meme coins. Conclusion — The Next SHIB or Just Hype? MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a presale contender with the kind of explosive upside that has defined past crypto bull markets. Analysts’ projections of up to 18,000% gains underscore the speculative opportunity, while its viral narrative and capped supply structure give it an edge over meme tokens that rely solely on hype. Whether MAGACOIN can truly replicate SHIB’s legendary run will depend on adoption and delivery. But for investors seeking the next meme-driven breakout, the presale represents a window of opportunity that may not last long.

Regulators have issued administrative guidance, effectively initiating a South Korea crypto lending ban on new lending products from exchanges. This move is a crucial step towards safeguarding investors and stabilizing the market. This directive highlights growing concerns over the proliferation of high-risk, leveraged products being offered without adequate investor protections. It’s a clear signal that authorities are prioritizing consumer safety in the rapidly evolving digital asset space. Why the South Korea Crypto Lending Ban? Addressing Key Concerns The primary driver behind the South Korea crypto lending ban is a commitment to mitigate investor losses. Financial regulators observed a concerning trend: crypto exchanges were launching sophisticated lending products that carried substantial risks, often without fully informing users of the potential pitfalls. Here are the core reasons for this decisive action: Investor Protection: Many leveraged products expose investors to magnified losses, particularly in volatile crypto markets. The guidance aims to prevent scenarios where individuals could face severe financial harm. Market Stability: Uncontrolled high-risk offerings can amplify market volatility. By reining in these products, regulators seek to foster a more stable and predictable environment. Lack of Safeguards: Regulators identified a deficit in sufficient safeguards accompanying these new lending services. This left investors vulnerable to opaque terms and potential exploitation. Authorities have made it clear: firms ignoring this guidance will face consequences, including on-site inspections and other supervisory measures. This underscores the seriousness of the South Korea crypto lending ban . What Does the South Korea Crypto Lending Ban Mean for Exchanges? For cryptocurrency exchanges operating in South Korea, this administrative guidance marks a significant shift. They must now immediately halt the development and launch of any new lending products. This directive compels exchanges to: Review Existing Products: While the guidance specifically targets new products, exchanges may feel pressure to review their current offerings to ensure they align with the spirit of the regulation. Prioritize Compliance: Compliance departments will need to work closely with legal teams to understand the full scope of the guidance and implement necessary changes. Innovate Responsibly: The focus will likely shift towards developing more secure, less leveraged products that meet regulatory standards, rather than pushing high-risk options. This proactive stance by regulators demonstrates their intent to maintain a tight grip on the digital asset market, ensuring that growth does not come at the expense of investor well-being. How Does the South Korea Crypto Lending Ban Affect Investors? For investors, the South Korea crypto lending ban is largely a protective measure. While it might limit some high-yield opportunities, it significantly reduces exposure to potentially devastating losses. Investors can expect: Reduced Risk: Fewer highly leveraged and complex lending products will be available, leading to a safer investment landscape. Greater Transparency: As regulators scrutinize offerings, there is an expectation that any future lending products will come with clearer terms and better safeguards. Increased Confidence: Stronger regulatory oversight can instill greater trust in the crypto market, potentially attracting more mainstream participants over time. Ultimately, this guidance aims to foster a healthier investment environment where participants are better protected from the inherent volatility and risks of the crypto space. Broader Implications of the South Korea Crypto Lending Ban The decision by South Korean regulators sends a strong message globally. It highlights a growing trend among jurisdictions to regulate the crypto industry more closely, especially concerning products that mirror traditional financial services but lack similar oversight. This could influence other nations to: Adopt Similar Measures: Other countries might look to South Korea’s approach as a blueprint for managing crypto lending risks. Increase Regulatory Scrutiny: The focus on investor protection could lead to broader discussions about comprehensive frameworks for decentralized finance (DeFi) and other emerging crypto services. Foster Responsible Innovation: Regulators worldwide are balancing innovation with the need for consumer safety, pushing the industry towards more sustainable and compliant growth. The South Korea crypto lending ban is a pivotal moment, underscoring the ongoing global effort to integrate digital assets into a regulated financial system. In conclusion, South Korea’s directive to halt new crypto lending products is a significant regulatory intervention aimed squarely at investor protection and market stability. By addressing concerns about high-risk, leveraged offerings, regulators are sending a clear message to exchanges: responsible innovation is paramount. This move will likely shape the future of crypto product development in the region and may influence regulatory approaches worldwide, ultimately fostering a safer environment for all participants in the digital asset economy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the core reason for the South Korea crypto lending ban? The primary reason is to protect investors from high-risk, leveraged crypto lending products that lack sufficient safeguards, which could lead to significant financial losses and increased market volatility. Does this ban affect existing crypto lending products in South Korea? The administrative guidance specifically directs exchanges to halt the launch of new lending products. While it doesn’t explicitly ban existing ones, it signals increased scrutiny and potential future reviews. What happens if an exchange ignores the South Korea crypto lending ban guidance? Regulators have warned that firms ignoring the guidance and causing user harm will face severe supervisory measures, including on-site inspections and other enforcement actions. How will this impact investor choice in South Korea’s crypto market? While it may limit access to certain high-yield, high-risk products, the ban aims to create a safer environment, potentially increasing overall confidence and attracting more secure investment options in the long run. Is this part of a broader global trend in crypto regulation? Yes, many countries are increasing their regulatory oversight on crypto activities, particularly those that resemble traditional financial services, to enhance investor protection and maintain market integrity.

Recently, a significant report from iM Securities, cited by Money Today, highlighted a crucial development: stablecoins are poised to threaten XRP’s market position as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. This insight offers a compelling look into the shifting power structures within the digital asset space. What’s Driving the Stablecoin Surge? The stablecoin market has experienced explosive growth, now reaching an approximate value of $270 billion. An analyst from the South Korean brokerage firm, iM Securities, points to the anticipated launch of a crypto-friendly Trump 2.0 administration as a key catalyst for this rapid expansion. This political shift is perceived to foster an environment more conducive to digital asset innovation and adoption, particularly for stable, fiat-pegged cryptocurrencies. Policy Influence: A favorable regulatory climate can significantly accelerate market growth. Increased Adoption: Businesses and individuals find stablecoins appealing for transactions due to their predictable value. Market Confidence: Regulatory clarity often boosts investor and user confidence, leading to greater capital inflow. How Do Stablecoins Threaten XRP’s Market Position? The core of the challenge lies in the fundamental difference between stablecoins and volatile assets like XRP. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a 1:1 peg with traditional fiat currencies, such as the US dollar. This peg effectively eliminates price volatility risk, making them highly suitable for various financial activities, especially international remittances and daily transactions. Conversely, XRP’s market position is currently defined by its role as a bridge currency for cross-border payments. However, like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), XRP’s value is subject to significant fluctuations driven by market supply and demand. This inherent volatility makes it less than ideal for situations where price stability is paramount, such as large-scale international transfers where a sudden drop in value could lead to substantial losses for senders or recipients. XRP’s Role in Remittances: A Closer Look While XRP has been championed for its speed and low transaction costs in international remittances, its price volatility presents a practical hurdle. Imagine a business sending a large sum of money across borders using XRP; a significant price swing during the transaction could impact the final received amount. This risk is precisely what stablecoins mitigate. Their consistent value offers a reliable medium of exchange, which is highly attractive for institutional and commercial use cases requiring predictability. The analyst’s warning underscores that while XRP has its strengths, the rise of stablecoins offers a compelling alternative for its primary use case. This competitive pressure could inevitably impact XRP’s market position in the long run. What Does This Mean for XRP’s Future? The growing prominence of stablecoins necessitates a re-evaluation of XRP’s strategy and value proposition. For XRP to maintain or strengthen its market position, it may need to emphasize other unique benefits or adapt to the changing competitive landscape. The market is increasingly prioritizing stability for certain applications, and stablecoins perfectly fit this demand. This trend suggests that while XRP remains a key player, it faces a formidable challenge from a category of digital assets designed specifically to address volatility concerns. The evolving market dynamics mean that investors and users should carefully consider the distinct advantages and disadvantages of each asset. Understanding these differences is crucial for navigating the future of cryptocurrency investments and adoption, especially concerning XRP’s market position and its potential evolution. In conclusion, the rapid expansion of the stablecoin market, fueled by potential policy shifts, presents a significant and crucial threat to XRP’s market position . While XRP has long held a prominent spot, its inherent volatility stands in contrast to the price stability offered by stablecoins, which are becoming increasingly favored for their reliability in international transactions. This competitive pressure highlights the ongoing evolution of the crypto landscape and the need for digital assets to adapt to emerging market demands. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a stablecoin? A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to minimize price volatility. It achieves this by being pegged to a stable asset, like the U.S. dollar, gold, or another fiat currency, typically at a 1:1 ratio. Why are stablecoins growing so rapidly? Stablecoins are growing due to their utility in providing stability in volatile crypto markets, making them ideal for transactions, remittances, and DeFi applications. Anticipated crypto-friendly policies, such as those from a potential Trump 2.0 administration, also contribute to increased confidence and adoption. How does XRP differ from stablecoins? XRP is a cryptocurrency that experiences price fluctuations based on market supply and demand, similar to Bitcoin and Ethereum. Stablecoins, however, are designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency, minimizing volatility. Why might stablecoins be preferred over XRP for international remittances? Stablecoins offer price predictability, which is crucial for international remittances. Their stable value ensures that the amount sent remains consistent throughout the transaction, unlike XRP, whose value can fluctuate significantly, introducing risk for both senders and recipients. Will XRP lose its market position completely? While stablecoins pose a significant challenge, XRP’s future is not entirely predetermined. Its network efficiency and existing partnerships still offer value. However, it will likely face increased competition and may need to adapt its strategy to maintain its relevance and XRP’s market position in the evolving crypto ecosystem.

50311905,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=787222,1755566746,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50311905.jpeg,Figure Technology files for Nasdaq IPO after 22% revenue surge,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/figure-technology-files-for-nasdaq-ipo/,"Blockchain lender Figure Technology Solutions has filed to go public on Nasdaq, following a strong first half of 2025 marked by revenue growth and a return to profitability. The New York-based firm disclosed the plan in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Monday, announcing it will seek to list its shares under the ticker “FIGR.” Goldman Sachs, Jefferies, and Bank of America Securities are set to serve as lead underwriters for the offering. Figure reported $191 million in revenue for the six months ending June 30, a 22.4% increase from last year. The company also posted a $29 million profit, rebounding from a $13 million loss during the first half of 2024. The results reflect growing demand for blockchain-based lending and financial services. Since its founding in 2018, Figure has originated over $16 billion in home equity loans. Figure’s IPO filing emphasized that its blockchain platform allows it to introduce liquidity to traditionally illiquid markets. The company aims to reduce costs and expand access to financial products by tokenizing assets such as loans. Figure Technology joins crypto IPO wave Figure’s IPO is the latest wave of interest in digital asset companies accessing public markets in 2025. Circle, which contains a stablecoin called USDC, staged in January one of the largest stock offerings by a company in the crypto industry, indicating strong investor appetite despite turbulence across broader markets. Last week, the Winklevoss twins’ Gemini exchange filed for an IPO in New York. Analysts expect a wave of blockchain-driven companies—ranging from infrastructure builders to platforms enabling tokenization of virtually any asset—to follow suit in the coming months. This momentum, market watchers say, has been fueled by a change in the regulatory climate. Officials of the Trump administration have been relatively friendly toward digital assets, helping to clear up some of the uncertainty that had hung over businesses involving cryptocurrencies in prior years. Regulations on innovation and investment in blockchain have thus made it easier for enterprises to raise public funding. This atmosphere is remaking Wall Street’s relationship with crypto. Traditional banks, which once shunned blockchain startups, are now committing to underwriting IPOs, offering custody solutions, and backing financing rounds. Three other underwriters on Figure’s IPO, Goldman Sachs, Jefferies, and Bank of America Securities, are also broadening digital asset services offered. Analysts noted that the current wave of listings could shape how investors value blockchain companies going forward. Josef Schuster, the founder of IPOX, said crypto was becoming one of the main pillars of the IPO market and added that, in addition to IPOs, several firms were also pursuing de-SPAC mergers as a quicker route to access capital markets. With Circle’s blowout debut and Gemini’s filing grabbing attention, Figure is entering a market where crypto firms are no longer fringe players. They are becoming one of the fastest-growing categories in US listings, rivaling tech and biotech in size and momentum. Figure aims for IPO with strong leadership and blockchain-focused growth Figure was co-founded in 2018 by Mike Cagney, the prominent fintech entrepreneur who once ran SoFi. Cagney has been an early mover in popularising disruptive fintech for mainstream audiences. Under his leadership at Figure, the company has been among the most aggressive blockchain lenders in the United States. According to a prospectus filed with the IPO, its chairman and chief executive, Kevin Cagney, will have majority voting control once listed. This dual-class share structure will let him remain in control of company strategy, as tech founders at Google and Meta did after their companies went public. Investors say that this structure empowers Cagney to keep the company on a long-term track but also begs questions about shareholder control. Figure had raised $200 million seven months ago, in 2021, placing it at a $3.2 billion valuation. The company has not disclosed how much it intends to be valued in the IPO, but analysts anticipate high demand, with the firm back in the black and at the intersection of fintech and blockchain.

But whereas DOGE gets short-term buzz, the actual hype throughout the crypto space is gathering around Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a growing project that’s stealthily setting itself up as a top contender for 2025. Mutuum Finance token price in presale stage 6 is $0.035. It will rise by 14.29% to $0.04 in presale stage 7. Early investors will receive minimum 400% returns when the token goes live. Mutuum Finance already stands with over $14.6 million raised and over 15250 investors. The other tokens in the meantime just continue trading steadily, offering contrast to the heightened speculation surrounding Dogecoin (DOGE) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Dogecoin Price Prediction: Still Steady, Probable Movements Forward Dogecoin is at about $0.2305 on 16th August 2025, relatively flat in the $0.22–$0.23 price range. Recent technical setups in the golden-cross configurations and whale accumulation have triggered bullish investor sentiment, but limited price action prevails. As traders wait for a break higher over resistance levels like $0.24, stray momentum shifts can be imagined in the near term. Mutuum Finance Presale Flourishes, Receives 95.00 Trust Rating during Audit Mutuum Finance is proving to be very efficient in the DeFi sector. The project has a 95.0/100 trust score, audited and assured by Certik. It is offering a secure platform to perform DeFi transactions. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is combining established lending functionality with the security of a forward-thinking ecosystem that is defined by a clear DeFi focus. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also developing an Ethereum, overcollateralized USD-pegged stablecoin. It will offer long-term liquidity, trust, and stability to any client type. Mutuum Finance Presale Begins Phase 6 Mutuum Finance is gaining traction with its presale rounds closing in a rush. The project is already at phase 6 at $0.035. Its next phase’s price will be 14.29% higher at $0.04. Investment interest is gathering pace with the project having raised more than $14.6 million and already boasting more than 15250 token holders. Enhancing DeFi Security through Giveaway and $50,000 Bug Bounty Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has just announced a recent $100,000 giveaway . 10 lucky winners get $10,000 MUTM tokens. The team also initiated a top 50 token holder leaderboard that will reward bonus tokens to holders. As yet another step towards security of its platform, Mutuum Finance also introduced a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program in partnership with CertiK. It will be rewarding and paying for each bug at four different tiers, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low. The Next Generation of DeFi Lending MUTM gives users an effective and secure double lending channel. Peer-to-Contract model smart contracts render lending human-free. Peer-to-Peer infrastructure enables middleman elimination and gives lenders and borrowers direct access to each other. Dogecoin’s $1 target remains undecided, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is going forward with more promising prospects in the short term. Now at presale stage 6 at $0.035, the price will go up 14.29% to $0.04 at stage 7. Having accumulated over $14.5M from 15300+ investors, a 95.0 CertiK trust score, USD-pegged stablecoin proposals, dual lending structures, and a $100K giveaway, MUTM offers early buy-in opportunities for a potential 400%+ returns post-launch. Momentum is picking up rapidly, so this is a great time to buy before the next price breakout.

U.S. investment bank TD Cowen recently made a bold prediction, suggesting that MicroStrategy (MSTR), often seen as a proxy for Bitcoin investment, could amass an incredible 900,000 Bitcoin by the close of 2027. This projection highlights the growing confidence in MicroStrategy’s unique strategy and the potential for significant Strategy BTC holdings in the coming years. What Drives This Massive Strategy BTC Holdings Projection? TD Cowen has set a price target of $680 for MicroStrategy shares, a significant indicator of their bullish outlook. The firm’s recent acquisition of 430 BTC, valued at $51.4 million through a preferred stock issuance, underscores their continued commitment to Bitcoin accumulation. This substantial purchase further solidifies MicroStrategy’s position as a leading corporate holder of the digital asset. Their consistent buying strategy is a key factor in TD Cowen’s optimistic forecast for future Strategy BTC holdings . Why Does TD Cowen See 900,000 BTC as Achievable? Reaching 900,000 BTC by 2027 would mean MicroStrategy holds approximately 4.3% of Bitcoin’s total supply. TD Cowen points to several powerful catalysts that could drive this ambitious accumulation: Growing Corporate Bitcoin Adoption: More companies are considering or actively adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. This trend could validate MicroStrategy’s pioneering approach. Potential S&P 500 Inclusion: If MicroStrategy were to join the S&P 500, it would significantly boost its visibility and potentially attract more institutional investment, indirectly supporting further Strategy BTC holdings . Advances in Cloud Technology: MicroStrategy’s core business in cloud software continues to evolve, providing a stable revenue stream that can be used for Bitcoin acquisitions. Clearer Tax Treatment for Crypto: As regulatory frameworks mature, clearer tax guidelines could reduce uncertainty for corporate Bitcoin holders, encouraging more companies, including MicroStrategy, to increase their exposure. These factors combine to create a compelling narrative for MicroStrategy’s continued Bitcoin accumulation. The current closing price for MicroStrategy shares on August 18 was $363.60, providing a baseline for these future projections. What Are the Implications of Such Large Strategy BTC Holdings? Should MicroStrategy achieve this monumental goal, the implications for both the company and the broader Bitcoin ecosystem would be profound. Holding such a significant portion of Bitcoin’s supply could: Enhance Bitcoin’s Legitimacy: A major public company holding nearly 5% of Bitcoin’s supply would further legitimize Bitcoin as a global reserve asset. Influence Market Dynamics: While not a majority, such a large holding by one entity could influence market sentiment and potentially reduce supply on exchanges, impacting price dynamics. Solidify MicroStrategy’s Niche: It would cement MicroStrategy’s identity as a primary vehicle for investors seeking indirect Bitcoin exposure, strengthening its unique market position based on its Strategy BTC holdings . This projection isn’t just about MicroStrategy; it’s a testament to the evolving landscape of corporate finance and digital assets. It showcases how a traditional company can successfully pivot and thrive in the new digital economy by embracing Bitcoin. Challenges and Considerations for Strategy BTC Holdings While the outlook is overwhelmingly positive, it is also important to consider potential challenges. Market volatility remains a key factor in the crypto space. Regulatory changes, while potentially beneficial in the long run, could also introduce short-term uncertainties. Furthermore, the ability to consistently acquire such large amounts of Bitcoin without significantly impacting market prices will be a continuous strategic consideration for MicroStrategy. However, MicroStrategy has consistently demonstrated a robust and well-thought-out approach to its Bitcoin acquisition strategy. Their leadership has openly communicated their long-term vision, building trust and confidence among investors in their commitment to increasing Strategy BTC holdings . The Road Ahead: A Bitcoin-Centric Future? TD Cowen’s projection paints a fascinating picture of MicroStrategy’s future. It suggests a future where corporate balance sheets increasingly feature digital assets, with Bitcoin leading the charge. This vision aligns with the broader trend of institutional adoption and the growing recognition of Bitcoin’s value proposition. MicroStrategy’s journey, driven by its aggressive accumulation of Bitcoin, serves as a compelling case study for other corporations contemplating similar moves. The potential for 900,000 Strategy BTC holdings by 2027 is a powerful indicator of the transformative impact Bitcoin could have on traditional finance. In conclusion, TD Cowen’s ambitious projection for MicroStrategy to hold 900,000 BTC by 2027 highlights a significant shift in corporate asset management. Driven by catalysts like increasing corporate adoption, potential S&P 500 inclusion, and clearer regulatory environments, MicroStrategy continues to lead the charge in institutional Bitcoin accumulation. This forecast not only underscores MicroStrategy’s bold strategy but also signals a promising future for Bitcoin’s role in the global financial landscape. The journey towards these massive Strategy BTC holdings will be keenly watched by the entire crypto community. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1.

In collaboration with The Harris Poll, the study highlights the growing dependence on AI in the gaming industry amid rising budgets, extended development timelines, and frequent workforce reductions. The survey, which included 615 developers from the U.S., South Korea, Norway, Finland, and Sweden between late June and early July, found that 87% already use AI tools to streamline and automate their workloads. AI accelerates game development For game studios , the allure of artificial intelligence is simple: It saves time and money and opens new creative horizons. Developers say AI is now used to do work that once took weeks or even months of human labor. Common applications of AI in gaming include debugging complex code, testing game mechanics, and checking for errors that could delay releases. Many studios also use AI to generate dialogue for additional characters, produce realistic character voices, and even design entire in-game worlds—fueling a growing AI-driven competition among developers and studios. Tasks that once required teams of writers, artists, and testers can now be completed far more quickly with AI’s assistance, sparking widespread speculation about the future of gaming. By offloading task-based, or at least repetitive, work onto AI systems, developers can focus on the aspects that define gaming: storylines, characters with depth, game worlds, and in-game innovation. This change is immensely helpful in an industry where gamers crave ever-tighter visuals and more engrossing gameplay. The study found that 44% of respondents already use AI agents to rapidly analyze and optimize huge volumes of data, including text, audio, video, and code. Not only do these agents speed up pipelines, but they also create greater developer empowerment to act quickly. In practice, this makes it possible for content to go from concept to testing and release far more quickly. This speed is crucial for an industry under pressure to deliver bigger, slicker games. Big publishers now invest hundreds of millions of dollars in blockbuster games, many of which take more than five years to make. AI offers a means of shortening these cycles without compromising the quality level. And there is strong confidence in AI’s long-term impact. 94% of surveyed developers expect AI to reduce total development costs sooner or later. With budgets ballooning and profit margins pinching, to a great many in Hollywood, AI is much more than a handy tool; it’s a financial lifeline that could decide which studios live to see the light of the next decade or two. AI adoption sparks cost, legal, and job concerns in gaming and media However, there are also risks associated with the rise of AI. Almost one in four developers found it hard to determine the real return on investment from AI tools. Introducing AI systems comes with a costly investment and an already stretched budget. Even more disturbing is a grey zone of copyright and data ownership. Roughly 63% of respondents were worried about who owns AI-generated content. With laws and licensing systems murky at best, studios could face legal challenges over assets produced with the help of AI tech. The anxiety is not new. Last year, video game performers went on strike along with Hollywood actors, partly based on concerns that AI might eventually replace human effort and diminish pay. Meanwhile, over 10,000 gaming industry jobs were lost globally as sizable studios were downsized or shut down.

A powerful Bitcoin investor, often referred to as a ‘whale’ due to their immense holdings, has just made a striking move, signaling potential confidence in Bitcoin’s trajectory. This significant transaction, involving a large sum of Bitcoin, provides valuable insights into the current market sentiment among major players. Understanding Whale BTC Accumulation: What Does It Mean? When we talk about Whale BTC Accumulation , we are referring to instances where individuals or entities holding vast amounts of Bitcoin acquire even more. These ‘whales’ typically possess enough capital to significantly influence market dynamics with their trades. Their actions are closely watched by analysts and investors alike because they often precede notable market shifts. Market Influence: Whales can move markets due to the sheer volume of their transactions. Sentiment Indicator: Their accumulation often signals a bullish outlook on Bitcoin’s future price. Strategic Positioning: Large buys might indicate long-term conviction rather than short-term speculation. Therefore, observing such large-scale buying activity provides a unique lens through which to understand underlying market forces and potential future trends. Unpacking the Latest FalconX Transaction: A Deep Dive into This Bitcoin Whale Activity The latest episode of significant Whale BTC Accumulation involves an address identified as bc1qgf. This address recently received a staggering 300 BTC, valued at approximately $34.85 million, from FalconX just eight hours ago. This particular transaction was highlighted by Lookonchain on X, a well-known on-chain analytics platform. What makes this even more compelling is the broader context: Over the past month, this same whale has amassed a total of 1,521 BTC. The cumulative value of these holdings stands at an impressive $179.4 million. The average acquisition price for these Bitcoins during this period was $117,921. FalconX, in this scenario, functions as a prime broker, facilitating large-volume institutional trades. This suggests that the whale is likely a sophisticated entity, possibly an institution or a very high-net-worth individual, utilizing professional trading infrastructure to execute such massive transactions discreetly. What Drives Such Enormous Whale BTC Accumulation? The motivation behind such substantial Whale BTC Accumulation is often multifaceted. Generally, these large-scale purchases are not impulsive but are rather strategic decisions based on thorough analysis and a strong belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. For instance, whales might accumulate during periods of market consolidation or perceived dips, viewing them as opportune moments to increase their holdings before an anticipated price surge. Consider these potential drivers: Long-Term Conviction: A strong belief in Bitcoin as a store of value or a hedge against inflation. Strategic Positioning: Anticipation of future market events, such as institutional adoption or regulatory clarity, that could boost Bitcoin’s price. OTC Deals: Utilizing platforms like FalconX for over-the-counter (OTC) trades helps execute large orders without causing immediate market impact, indicating a strategic approach to accumulation. These whales often possess unique market insights or are simply executing a predetermined long-term investment strategy. Implications for the Market: Decoding Whale BTC Accumulation Signals The continuous Whale BTC Accumulation by significant players sends a powerful signal to the broader cryptocurrency market. Such persistent buying can be interpreted as a strong vote of confidence in Bitcoin, potentially influencing the sentiment of retail investors and other institutional players. When whales are actively accumulating, it can suggest that they foresee significant upside potential, which in turn might encourage others to buy. However, it’s also important to consider the dual nature of these movements: Bullish Indicator: Persistent accumulation can support price stability and upward momentum. Potential Volatility: While accumulation is positive, large holdings also mean whales have the power to sell, which could lead to significant price drops if they decide to liquidate. Nevertheless, the current trend of this specific whale’s activity points towards a bullish long-term outlook, reinforcing Bitcoin’s position as a preferred asset for substantial capital deployment. In conclusion, the recent Whale BTC Accumulation by the bc1qgf address via FalconX underscores a significant belief in Bitcoin’s future. This ongoing accumulation, totaling over 1,500 BTC in just one month, highlights the strategic moves of major players in the crypto space. As these large investors continue to position themselves, their actions offer compelling insights into the potential trajectory of the world’s leading cryptocurrency. It serves as a reminder that despite market fluctuations, conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value remains strong among its most substantial holders. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a Bitcoin whale? A Bitcoin whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of Bitcoin, typically enough to significantly influence the market with their buying or selling activities. Their transactions are closely monitored for insights into market trends. What is FalconX and why do whales use it? FalconX is a cryptocurrency prime broker that offers institutional-grade trading, credit, and clearing services. Whales and institutions often use platforms like FalconX for over-the-counter (OTC) transactions, which allows them to execute large orders without impacting the open market price. How does whale accumulation affect Bitcoin’s price? Whale accumulation is generally seen as a bullish signal. It indicates strong demand from large holders, which can support Bitcoin’s price, reduce available supply on exchanges, and foster positive market sentiment. However, their eventual selling could also lead to price drops. What does the average price of $117,921 for this whale’s BTC imply? The average price of $117,921 for this whale’s accumulated BTC indicates that these purchases were made at significantly higher price points than Bitcoin’s recent trading range. This could imply a long-term investment strategy where the whale is not concerned with short-term fluctuations, or it might reflect the nature of OTC deals which sometimes involve premium pricing for large, discreet transactions. Where can I track whale activity? You can track whale activity using on-chain analytics platforms like Lookonchain (as mentioned in the article), Glassnode, CryptoQuant, and Arkham Intelligence.

While established tokens like Litecoin, XRP, TRX, Chainlink, and Stellar remain strong contenders, one presale project — MAGACOIN FINANCE — is quickly becoming the surprise favorite among breakout candidates for 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE — The Breakout Contender Analysts are highlighting a new wave of altcoins with explosive upside, and MAGACOIN FINANCE leads the list. With forecasts of 18,000% ROI, it’s being called one of the most powerful breakout candidates heading into 2025. Backed by whale accumulation, scarcity-driven tokenomics, and rapid presale traction, the project is quickly gaining attention among both retail investors and institutions. Funding inflows are rising sharply, and with allocations running out, momentum is building faster than expected. Analysts suggest that this combination of scarcity and investor conviction could make MAGACOIN FINANCE one of the most impactful early-stage stories of the next market cycle. Litecoin (LTC) — Testing Critical Support Litecoin has dropped slightly by 2.32% and now trades at $118. Although whale participation is less, the retail demand has kept the token at key trendlines. LTC may progress towards $150 in the coming months if retail momentum continues, analysts note. Due to its position as one of the oldest cryptocurrencies in existence, users regard it as credible while its liquidity and a resilient network make it a reliable long-term play. XRP — Consolidating Around $3.00 XRP is nearly $3.05, which is a minor dips consolidation level and strong support at $2.90. Demanding rumor and institutional sensing have buoyed sentiment over XRP’s appraisal as a long-term global payments leader. According to analysts, XRP is one of the only assets that can grow in a bull or corrective phase because it is a settlement token. TRON (TRX) — Steady But Cautious Momentum TRON is stable, trading at $0.349, a tad lower on the day. It remains above the 50-day av. of $0.316. TRX remains part of the discussion in the market because it has a strong transaction volume and a strong blockchain. Analysts think that momentum has slowed down, however, there may still be some upside if the overall altcoin sentiment improves. Chainlink (LINK) — Infrastructure Strength Chainlink price of $25.18 has remained stable following a recent rally on the back of strong partnerships, and continuing infrastructure build-up. With analysts eyeing $26–$30 imminently, LINK continues to be one of the leading altcoins behind DeFi and linking blockchains. As adoption grows, there will always be demand as an oracle provider. Stellar (XLM) — Institutional Interest Holding Ground Stellar is priced at $0.413 after a 2.79% decline but remains supported near the $0.41 level. With institutional interest and real-world payment applications backing its use case, analysts expect Stellar to maintain a moderately bullish outlook. Its role in cross-border payments gives it a strategic place among altcoins positioned for steady growth. Conclusion — Positioning Ahead of the Breakout Litecoin, XRP, TRON, Chainlink, and Stellar all provide unique advantages, from infrastructure strength to institutional adoption. But the emerging narrative points to MAGACOIN FINANCE as the standout contender , with forecasts projecting explosive growth potential. For investors seeking high-multiple upside in 2025, positioning early in these assets could provide the strongest opportunity before the next market surge.

Solana DeFi TVL Soars 30% According to market analysis firm Messari, the total value locked in DeFi on the Solana ecosystem surged by 30.4% quarter-over-quarter, reaching $8.6 billion. This growth solidified Solana’s position as the second-largest network in DeFi TVL. However, the quarter was not without its challenges. Average daily spot decentralized exchange (DEX) volume experienced a sharp decline of 45.4%, dropping to $2.5 billion, attributed to the waning excitement surrounding memecoins. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulls Must Survive Brutal September Before Q4 Hope, Analyst Predicts The stablecoin market on Solana also faced headwinds, with its market cap decreasing by 17.4% to $10.3 billion, positioning it third among networks. A significant portion of this growth earlier in the year was fueled by the launch of the official TRUMP token on January 17, which injected substantial liquidity into the ecosystem and created high-liquidity trading pairs utilizing Circle’s USDC stablecoin. Despite the decline, the stablecoin market’s sustained growth indicates that much of the new capital has remained within the Solana network, according to the firm’s findings. By the end of Q2 2025, USDC’s market cap stood at $7.2 billion, reflecting a 25.2% decline and a 69.5% market share. Meanwhile, Tether’s USDT maintained its position as the second-largest stablecoin on Solana, holding a steady $2.3 billion. Network Activity In terms of staking, Solana’s liquid staking rate rose to 12.2%, an increase of 16.8% from the previous quarter. With 64.8% of SOL’s circulating supply now staked, this growth in liquid staking enhances the DeFi ecosystem, supporting yield-bearing opportunities for SOL holders. Solana’s circulating market cap also grew by 29.8% to $82.8 billion, placing it sixth among all cryptocurrencies, behind Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Tether, XRP, and Binance Coin (BNB). The non-fungible token (NFT) market, however, faced a downturn, with average daily trading volume plummeting by 46.4% to approximately $979,500 in Q2. Despite this decline, Solana’s NFTs continue to lead in creator royalties. Related Reading: Ethereum Hits $4,350 Liquidity Pool: Can Demand Hold? Network activity remained relatively stable, with average daily fee payers decreasing slightly by 1.4% to 3.9 million, while non-vote transactions rose by 4% to 99.1 million. The average transaction fee saw a significant drop of 59.6%, settling at just $0.01. On a broader scale, total staked value hit an all-time high of $102 billion on January 18, coinciding with SOL’s peak price of approximately $295. By the end of Q2, the total staked SOL had increased by 25.2% to $60 billion. Messari’s analysis hints that while the Solana ecosystem is navigating through a phase of “adjustment,” its foundational metrics and continued development might signal a promising outlook for the future. As of this writing, SOL’s price stands at $184.50, recording a 4.4% drop in the past 24 hours. When compared to its $293 record reached earlier this year, SOL’s price trades nearly 40% below.

50313635,559212,1755568825,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50313635.jpeg,Stablecoin Shift: Japan Eyes Approval Of Yen-Backed Token,https://bitcoinist.com/stablecoin-shift-japan-eyes-approval-of-yen-backed-token/,"Japan is inching towards the approval of its first yen-backed stablecoin, with regulators likely to approve it as soon as October. Nikkei reports that the token, named JPYC, will be issued by Tokyo fintech company JPYC and will be backed by the Japanese yen with reserves like bank deposits and government debt. Stablecoin Target Remittances And Corporate Payments The forthcoming launch follows a 2023 revision of Japan’s Financial Services Agency’s legal requirements classifying stablecoins as “currency-denominated assets.” With this regulation, only licensed money transfer companies, trust companies, and banks may issue them. JPYC is in the process of registering as a money transfer company within the month, which will enable selling tokens shortly afterward. The company’s goal is ambitious. Within the next three years, it plans to sell 1 trillion yen’s worth of JPYC, roughly $6.8 billion at the current rate of 147 yen per dollar . Japan to greenlight first yen-based stablecoin. The Financial Services Agency will approve the issuance of Japan’s first yen-denominated stablecoin as early as autumn, with the aim of using it for international remittances and more. — World of Statistics (@stats_feed) August 18, 2025 The tokens might be utilized for cross-border remittances, corporate payments abroad, or trading in decentralized finance markets. News also indicates hedge funds dealing in cryptocurrencies and family offices handling money of rich investors are already evincing interest. Carry Trades Attract Institutional Interest Market observers think that JPYC can also find use in carry trades, which exploit the disparity in interest rates among currencies. That prospect has attracted institutional interest at a point when stablecoins are becoming popular worldwide. Dollar-backed tokens continue to hold sway, with the overall value of all stablecoins recently hitting more than $250 billion. Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC continue to be used the most for trading and settlements. Yet, Japan’s attempt to launch a regulated yen-backed token may signal the way toward increased regional adoption in Asia, where dollar-denominated stablecoin alternatives are being monitored closely. Regulated Path Offers Predictability JPYC’s approval would highlight Japan’s stricter but clearer approach compared to many other countries. Analysts say the framework gives companies more certainty as they test blockchain-based settlement systems without fear of regulatory ambiguity. According to estimates, the global stablecoin market could swell to nearly $4 trillion by 2030, more than 10 times its current size. And if yen-pegged instruments, such as JPYC, gain traction, they could capture some of that growth and resonate with Asian investors looking for alternatives to dollars. The Japanese move also comes as governments across the globe heighten their monitoring of stablecoins due to fears about financial stability.

His message was accompanied by a video featuring Tom Farley, the CEO of Bullish, who spoke extensively about the evolving dynamics of the cryptocurrency market and the increasing role of institutional investors. Farley’s Insights on Bullish and Institutional Engagement In the video , Farley began by outlining the scope of Bullish’s operations. He stated that the company runs both an exchange and a data business, which includes CoinDesk, BD Alpha, and a conference arm. According to him, the company’s core mission centers on servicing institutional clients, with the strategy of aligning its business model to their needs. Farley noted that Bullish currently works with over 1,000 customers, which he emphasized as a significant figure in the still-maturing cryptocurrency industry. He went on to point out that the present environment appears favorable for crypto adoption, citing legislative developments such as the Genius Act from Congress and the Clarity Act from the House. Farley explained that these measures provide clearer pathways for institutions to access and participate in the digital asset space. He contrasted the past decade of cryptocurrency growth, which was largely driven by retail activity, with the emerging trend of large-scale institutional involvement . FINAL WARNING #XRP HOLDERS! pic.twitter.com/KKnbyd1jrU — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) August 16, 2025 Institutional Wave and Its Implications Farley was clear in his assessment that the so-called institutional wave is no longer in its early stages but has already arrived. He described it as an ongoing development whose scale remains to be seen, yet he suggested confidence in its potential. He linked this perspective to the strong reception Bullish has observed in connection with its initial public offering, which he characterized as evidence of significant institutional interest . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This emphasis on institutions entering the market represents a critical shift in the narrative around crypto adoption. Farley underscored that the attention and capital from large financial entities could define the next phase of industry growth, setting it apart from the predominantly retail-led expansion that marked earlier years. Rietveld’s decision to highlight Farley’s comments suggests a view that the entry of institutions into crypto may accelerate developments that retail participants cannot ignore. His statement to XRP holders indicates that he considers the matter urgent and directly relevant to their investment strategies.

When big wallets shift billions, smaller investors usually pay attention — and the patterns right now are hard to miss. XRP is seeing some of the heaviest accumulation in months, SEI has clawed its way back into breakout territory, and MAGACOIN FINANCE has burst onto the scene with one of the fastest-selling presales of 2025. Alongside blue-chip names like Ethereum, Solana, Toncoin, and Avalanche, these tokens are shaping the shortlist of coins that traders say could lead the next bull run. XRP — Whales Absorb the Panic Despite August’s turbulence, XRP’s chart tells a different story behind the scenes. More than 440 million XRP changed hands into whale wallets during recent sell-offs — a sign of quiet confidence from the biggest players. The token currently hovers between $2.95 and $3.14, with analysts eyeing a rebound to the $4.00–$4.47 zone if market sentiment steadies. The thesis is simple: when whales lean in this heavily, they’re often preparing for a breakout. Ripple’s growing role in cross-border payments only strengthens that view. SEI — Quietly Building Momentum SEI isn’t the loudest name in the room, but it’s making noise in the right circles. The Layer-1 token has snapped out of a long downtrend, drawing smart money inflows and renewed optimism from traders. Due to this, market forecasts suggest gains of up to 160%, with targets around $0.90 in 2025. Undoubtedly, EI’s appeal lies in speed and scalability, the same qualities that once propelled Solana. For those who can stomach risk, SEI is emerging as one of the higher-upside plays outside the top 20 coins. MAGACOIN FINANCE — The Crypto Presale That Won’t Slow Down XRP and SEI might be showing strength, but MAGACOIN FINANCE has something neither of them does, which is a crypto presale that’s already rewriting expectations. Wallet activity is surging, allocations are selling out fast, and both retail and whale buyers are jumping in before listings. Analysts project as much as 35x upside, citing MAGACOIN’s viral branding and capped supply as the twin forces behind its rise. Notably, the project blends meme energy with DeFi-style tokenomics, positioning it as the most aggressive new entrant of 2025. It’s not for the faint of heart, but for those chasing asymmetric bets, MAGACOIN is quickly becoming the coin speculators don’t want to miss. Ethereum — Shrinking Supply, Growing Demand Ethereum continues to play its role as the bedrock of DeFi and stablecoin. With exchange balances at multi-year lows and institutional ETFs pulling in steady inflows, ETH is showing the slow, relentless accumulation pattern of a blue-chip asset. So, investors looking for stability with upside still treat the top crypto asset as a must-own. Solana — Proving It’s Not a Fad Solana has had its setbacks, but the network’s developer ecosystem hasn’t slowed. Gaming and NFTs remain strong points, and whale activity is beginning to reflect that optimism. Essentially, SOL still has a seat at the table for traders who want exposure to high-performance chains. Toncoin — The Social Network Play Few projects can tap into an existing user base the size of Telegram’s 800 million accounts. Toncoin does just that. By embedding its wallet directly into the app, TON has turned itself into a native payments and DeFi rail with instant distribution. That kind of reach makes it unique among altcoins. Avalanche — Betting on Infrastructure Avalanche’s subnet architecture keeps attracting builders, giving it a long-term edge as an infrastructure play. After retracing in previous cycles, AVAX now sits undervalued relative to its potential, making it a contrarian bet for investors who prefer the “picks and shovels” side of blockchain. The Bottom Line Each coin on this list offers something different: XRP has whale confidence, SEI is clawing back into form, and Ethereum and Solana bring scale and credibility. Toncoin and Avalanche cover real-world integration and infrastructure growth. But the wildcard is clear: MAGACOIN FINANCE is the new entry that’s turned heads this quarter. It combines an energetic crypto presale frenzy with whale momentum, giving it a unique position on the list of 2025’s best crypto bets. If XRP brings clarity and SEI brings speed, MAGACOIN FINANCE brings the early-stage energy that often sparks the biggest gains.

This innovative concept is gaining traction, promising to enhance network security and unlock new yield opportunities. In a move set to bolster the Ethereum ecosystem, ETH Strategy, a prominent treasury protocol, has announced a pivotal partnership with EtherFi, a leading liquid restaking platform. This collaboration is a game-changer for participants interested in leveraged exposure to Ethereum. Unpacking the ETH Restaking Partnership This exciting alliance brings together two key players in the Ethereum landscape. ETH Strategy operates as a treasury protocol, offering users leveraged exposure to Ethereum (ETH). This means it allows participants to amplify their potential returns on ETH holdings, albeit with associated risks. Their strategic approach aims to optimize capital efficiency within the DeFi space. On the other side, we have EtherFi (ETHFI), an innovative platform focused on ETH restaking . EtherFi distinguishes itself by providing a decentralized, non-custodial liquid restaking service. It allows users to stake their ETH and receive eETH, a liquid restaked token, which can then be used across various DeFi protocols while still earning staking rewards and potential restaking rewards. As part of their new partnership, ETH Strategy will strategically allocate a portion of its treasury funds to EtherFi. This allocation directly supports EtherFi’s operations and contributes to the growing volume of ETH being restaked on the platform. This mutual support strengthens both protocols and enhances the overall robustness of the Ethereum network. Why This ETH Restaking Collaboration Matters The collaboration between ETH Strategy and EtherFi carries significant implications for the broader Ethereum ecosystem. Firstly, it enhances the security of the Ethereum network. By increasing the amount of ETH restaked through EtherFi, more capital is committed to securing various AVSs (Actively Validated Services) built on top of Ethereum, making the network more resilient against attacks. Secondly, this partnership opens up new avenues for yield generation. ETH Strategy’s leveraged exposure, combined with EtherFi’s restaking rewards, could potentially offer attractive returns for participants. It allows for a compounding effect, where initial ETH exposure is amplified, and the underlying assets are simultaneously earning rewards through restaking. This innovative approach to yield optimization is a key benefit. Enhanced Network Security: More ETH committed to restaking strengthens the underlying infrastructure. Optimized Capital Efficiency: ETH Strategy’s leveraged model complements EtherFi’s yield-bearing liquid tokens. Increased Liquidity: EtherFi’s eETH token maintains liquidity for restaked assets, a crucial feature in DeFi. Broader Ecosystem Growth: The partnership fosters innovation and integration within the Ethereum DeFi landscape. Navigating the Future of ETH Restaking The emergence of ETH restaking as a dominant narrative in the Ethereum space signals a maturation of its staking ecosystem. Protocols like EtherFi are at the forefront, pioneering new ways to utilize staked ETH beyond traditional validation. This partnership exemplifies how specialized protocols can synergize to create more robust and rewarding opportunities for users. For individuals and institutions considering participation, understanding the mechanics of both ETH Strategy and EtherFi is crucial. While the potential for amplified returns is appealing, it is essential to conduct thorough due diligence and assess the associated risks, particularly with leveraged positions. The transparency and non-custodial nature of EtherFi’s approach provide a solid foundation for trust, however. This collaboration is a testament to the dynamic and interconnected nature of DeFi. It highlights a trend where specialized protocols are joining forces to build more comprehensive and efficient financial primitives. The future of ETH restaking looks promising, with more innovative partnerships expected to emerge, further solidifying Ethereum’s position as the leading smart contract platform. In conclusion, the strategic partnership between ETH Strategy and EtherFi marks a significant milestone in the evolution of ETH restaking . By combining leveraged exposure with liquid restaking capabilities, this alliance promises to deliver enhanced security, innovative yield opportunities, and greater capital efficiency within the Ethereum ecosystem. It’s an exciting time for those watching the growth of decentralized finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is ETH restaking?

The cryptocurrency world is always dynamic, and recently, a significant event has captured the attention of many: an early Ethereum whale made a substantial move. This transaction highlights the immense wealth accumulated by long-term holders and raises questions about market sentiment. Who is This Ethereum Whale and What Did They Do? On-chain data reveals a major transaction involving an address identified as an early Ethereum whale . This particular investor wallet recently sold a staggering 8,576 ETH, which amounted to approximately $37.02 million at the time of the sale. On-chain analyst @ai_9684xtpa first reported this activity on X, drawing immediate attention from the crypto community. What makes this sale particularly noteworthy is the wallet’s history. Ten years ago, this address received a substantial 20,756 ETH from an Ethereum Foundation-related wallet. The average acquisition price was an astonishingly low $0.875 per ETH. Today, even after this significant sale, the wallet still holds 10,209 ETH, indicating a massive unrealized profit from its initial investment. Initial Acquisition: 20,756 ETH at $0.875 (10 years ago) Recent Sale: 8,576 ETH for $37.02 million Current Holding: 10,209 ETH remaining Despite the connection, the Ethereum Foundation has consistently denied ownership of this specific address, adding a layer of mystery to the identity of this powerful Ethereum whale . Why Do Ethereum Whales Make Such Significant Moves? Understanding the motivations behind large sales by an Ethereum whale is crucial for market participants. These early investors often possess a deep understanding of the market and project cycles. Their actions can sometimes signal broader trends or shifts in confidence. Several reasons might prompt such a substantial sale: Profit Taking: After holding for a decade, the current market price represents an immense profit margin for this investor. Taking profits is a natural financial strategy. Portfolio Rebalancing: Whales may sell off one asset to diversify their holdings, invest in other cryptocurrencies, or allocate funds to traditional assets. Market Outlook: Sometimes, large sales can indicate a whale’s bearish short-term outlook, anticipating a potential market correction. Conversely, they might sell to prepare for future buying opportunities at lower prices. Liquidity Needs: While less common for such large amounts, personal or institutional liquidity needs can also drive sales. It’s important to remember that a single whale’s action, while significant, does not always dictate the entire market’s direction. However, monitoring these moves provides valuable insight into the flow of capital within the ecosystem. What Are the Market Implications of This Ethereum Whale Activity? When an Ethereum whale sells such a large quantity of ETH, it inevitably creates ripples across the market. In the short term, a sudden influx of supply can exert downward pressure on prices, especially if liquidity is thin. However, the Ethereum market is vast and resilient, often absorbing such sales without catastrophic impact. The psychological impact on retail investors can be more pronounced. News of a major sale by an early holder might trigger fear or uncertainty, leading some to reconsider their own positions. Conversely, strong buying demand can quickly absorb the supply, demonstrating market strength. For Ethereum, the long-term outlook remains tied to its fundamental developments, network upgrades, and increasing utility. While a large sale like this grabs headlines, the continuous growth of DeFi, NFTs, and Layer 2 solutions built on Ethereum often overshadows individual transactions in the grand scheme. Key Takeaways from the Ethereum Whale Sale Monitor On-Chain Data: Tools tracking whale movements offer valuable insights into potential market shifts. Understand Context: A single sale is a data point, not the entire picture. Consider the broader market trends and Ethereum’s fundamentals. Long-Term Perspective: Early investor moves, while impactful, are part of the market’s natural cycle. Ethereum’s robust ecosystem continues to evolve. This substantial sale by an early Ethereum whale serves as a vivid reminder of the incredible wealth creation potential within the crypto space. It also underscores the importance of staying informed about significant on-chain movements and their potential, albeit often temporary, effects on market dynamics. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is an Ethereum whale? An Ethereum whale refers to an individual or entity holding a very large amount of ETH, enough to potentially influence market prices through their buying or selling activities. Why is this particular ETH sale significant? This sale is significant because it involves an early investor who acquired ETH at a remarkably low price ($0.875) ten years ago. The sheer volume ($37.02 million) and the historical context make it a noteworthy event in the crypto community. Does a whale sale always cause a market crash? No, a whale sale does not always cause a market crash. While large sales can create short-term price pressure, the broader market’s liquidity, demand, and overall sentiment often determine the long-term impact. The Ethereum market is quite resilient. How can I track Ethereum whale movements? You can track Ethereum whale movements using on-chain analytics platforms and blockchain explorers. These tools provide transparency into large transactions and wallet activities, helping you monitor significant flows of ETH. What is the Ethereum Foundation’s role in this? The wallet that initially sent ETH to this address was described as ‘Ethereum Foundation-related.’ However, the Ethereum Foundation has publicly denied direct ownership or control over this specific address, adding to the mystery of the whale’s identity.

In a new YouTube analysis focused on altcoin rotation, he frames DOGE as a top-10 laggard that has yet to print a new all-time high this cycle—precisely the kind of setup that has historically preceded its biggest moves. Dogecoin Could Still Rip 500% This Cycle The analyst’s core thesis is structural rather than narrative-driven: Dogecoin advances in compressed bursts, with most of the cycle’s gains arriving in just a handful of outsized monthly candles. “If you look at it on the monthly… the majority of Doge’s move happens in like two different monthly pops,” he says, citing prior surges of “six, seven hundred percent,” followed by another consolidation and a second leg of roughly “five hundred percent.” By contrast, the largest single monthly gain so far this cycle sits near “about 150%,” a magnitude he views as small relative to DOGE’s historical blow-off dynamics. From a momentum perspective, he highlights a looming inflection on high-timeframe oscillators: “The monthly RSI is potentially about to cross bullish also,” adding that DOGE has “either wicked or got close to the oversold area” twice on the monthly. In his read, those conditions have coincided with DOGE’s most explosive phases: “The oversold area is when all the violent price action happens on the monthly or the weekly… for cryptos generally.” Related Reading: After Monero Hit, Qubic Group Puts Dogecoin On Target List Price mapping and targets are explicit. Assuming a repeat of DOGE’s typical impulse size, the analyst sketches a 500% scenario that would “take us up to like $1.40,” with a staged take-profit ladder beginning “at like $1.18.” He stresses this is a path consistent with DOGE’s historical cadence rather than a call on exact timing: the coin tends to grind, then erupt, compressing multiple hundreds of percentage points into one or two monthly candles. The setup he prefers is rooted in range structure and risk-reward. Across majors and large-cap alts, he observes a similar pattern: form a base, run to a range high, retrace to the base, and compress. “At the bottom of the range is where the best risk-reward is,” he notes, emphasizing that asymmetric entries come when price returns to prior support and sentiment is fragile. He applies the same logic to DOGE, arguing the current structure resembles past pre-acceleration phases rather than distribution. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bullish Signal: Whales Buy 2 Billion DOGE Rotation is the second pillar of the call. The analyst expects capital to continue sliding down the risk curve from Bitcoin into large-cap altcoins and then into high-beta names like DOGE. He points out that even a modest replication of recent capital flows into a single top-10 asset can reprice peers dramatically, and he uses market-cap arithmetic to illustrate the point. With Dogecoin around the mid-$30 billion range by his count, a few hundred billion dollars rotating across the complex—as seen elsewhere this cycle—would imply multi-fold upside for laggards. “That’s where market cap has a bit of an issue in crypto,” he cautions, but the example underlines how quickly prices can gap when liquidity chases momentum. The crux of the trade, he argues, is to stay aligned with the prevailing trend and use pullbacks to build long exposure: “Pullbacks are for buying in trending bull markets and that is what we’re in.” In his framework, the invalidation sits below established range lows, while the upside tails are long if DOGE repeats its signature monthly expansions. As for timing, he refrains from precision. Instead, he reiterates the behavioral pattern: DOGE’s cycle gains typically arrive in a short, violent window after prolonged compression. With a potential monthly RSI turn, a still-muted largest monthly candle compared to prior cycles, and a wider backdrop of alt rotation, he concludes that the conditions for Dogecoin’s next act are falling into place. “It’s probably crazy season,” he concluded, adding that investors who wait for unambiguous confirmation often find “when it’s happened, it’s too late.” At press time, DOGE traded at $0.2217.

Metaplanet Has Expanded Its Bitcoin Treasury Holdings As revealed by Metaplanet president Simon Gerovich in a new post on X, the company has acquired another 775 BTC. The purchase occurred at an average price of $120,006 per token, meaning that the firm spent a total of $93 million on the stack. This buy has taken Metaplanet’s holdings to 18,888 BTC, with a total cost basis of $1.94 billion. At the current price, the company’s reserve is worth around $2.17 billion, implying a positive unrealized gain of just under 12%. CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has shared a chart that shows how the firm’s buys have looked since it adopted a treasury strategy last year: The latest acquisition has come after the firm last week reported that Q2 2025 was its strongest quarter ever, with huge turnarounds occurring in ordinary profit and net income. Though, despite this performance, the stock price of Gerovich’s company remains 50% down since the all-time high (ATH) set back in June. The OG Bitcoin treasury company, Strategy , has also just unveiled a new purchase. According to Chairman Michael Saylor , the acquisition has involved 430 BTC bought for a total of $51.4 million. This has taken the total reserve of the company to 629,376 BTC with a cumulative cost of $46.15 billion. Saylor usually hints at purchases a day in advance by posting the Strategy BTC portfolio tracker with a cryptic caption. This time was no different, as the chairman made a post on Sunday sharing the tracker with the words: “Insufficient Orange.” Strategy is currently the largest holder of the cryptocurrency among both companies and governments. Here is a chart shared by institutional DeFi solutions provider Sentora in its report on BTC treasuries, which puts into perspective how the firm compares to Metaplanet and others: As displayed in the graph, Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings are significantly higher than those of the next largest holder, the US government. The difference is more gradual from there, with third-placed China sitting just $1 billion under the US. Metaplanet is all the way down in the thirteenth position, but if its accumulation remains as consistent as it has been lately, it might be able to climb up a couple of spots in the near future. BTC Price While treasury companies may be busy accumulating Bitcoin, the asset’s price has plunged to the $115,100 mark.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Metaplanet|Metaplanet Bitcoin,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-19 03:00:43

Analysts Compare It to SHIB’s Explosive Run,https://timestabloid.com/could-magacoin-finance-deliver-1000x-returns-analysts/,"The crypto market is moving again, and this time it isn’t just about Bitcoin or Ethereum. Following years of dominance by Ethereum and Bitcoin, attention is shifting toward early-stage projects that combine scarcity, strong community backing, and surging retail demand. MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly gained traction, with many suggesting it could mirror the explosive rallies that made tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu household names among investors. Ethereum and Bitcoin Still Dominate Ethereum is trading around the $4,200 mark, and Bitcoin continues to hold steady after recent highs. Both remain the giants of crypto, with billions flowing in from institutions. But here’s the truth: the days of seeing a 100x return on ETH or BTC are long gone. They’re stable, sure, but they’re no longer life-changing plays for the average investor. That’s why so many eyes are shifting toward newer, smaller coins with real upside — and MAGACOIN FINANCE is topping that list. Analysts Compare MAGACOIN FINANCE to SHIB’s Run Analysts are drawing comparisons between MAGACOIN FINANCE and Shiba Inu’s legendary breakout, noting that early-stage positioning, capped supply, and accelerating whale inflows give it a similar setup. With funding milestones already surpassed and demand rising, market watchers suggest MAGACOIN FINANCE could become one of the best altcoins of 2025 , with projections pointing to a possible 1000x upside . Just like SHIB rewarded its early believers with massive returns, experts believe MAGACOIN FINANCE has the same explosive ingredients — only this time, the window for early entry is still open. Why Timing Matters Crypto history has proven one thing: early movers win big. The people who bought Shiba Inu in its presale saw unbelievable returns, while latecomers caught only the scraps. Right now, MAGACOIN FINANCE is in that early sweet spot — enough traction to show it’s real, but still cheap enough that average investors can load up. Analysts calling it one of the best altcoins to buy now aren’t just hyping it — they’re pointing to so many factors which have in the past determine the winners and losers in the crypto market. Conclusion Ethereum and Bitcoin may stay safe bets, but the chance to see explosive growth lies elsewhere. With talk of 1000x upside and comparisons to SHIB’s legendary run, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being spotlighted as the best altcoin to buy now for anyone who doesn’t want to miss the next breakout. For traders on the lookout for their first breakout in the crypto market, analysts say MAGACOIN FINANCE has what it takes to deliver.

This growing backlog of validators seeking to exit their staked positions has captured the attention of the crypto community, raising questions about its implications for the network and the broader market. This situation highlights the dynamic nature of a proof-of-stake blockchain. Understanding the ETH Unstaking Queue Phenomenon Recent data highlights a remarkable surge in the ETH unstaking queue , reaching a record 910,461 ETH, valued at approximately $3.91 billion. This figure, reported by Wu Blockchain citing validator tracking site validatorqueue, represents the largest accumulation of exit requests since Ethereum transitioned to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) with the Merge and the subsequent Shapella upgrade enabled withdrawals. When validators decide to withdraw their staked Ether, they enter this queue, awaiting processing based on network capacity. The length of this queue is not static; it fluctuates based on the number of validators wishing to exit and the network’s processing capabilities. Ethereum is designed to handle these withdrawals in a controlled manner. This controlled release mechanism ensures that the network remains stable and secure, even during periods of high demand for unstaking, preventing sudden shocks to the system. Why Are Validators Joining the ETH Unstaking Queue? Exploring the Reasons Several factors can contribute to validators joining the ETH unstaking queue . Market Volatility: Periods of significant price swings or bearish market sentiment can prompt some validators to re-evaluate their investment strategies. They might seek to reduce their exposure or reallocate capital. Profitability Adjustments: Changes in staking rewards, operational costs, or the availability of more attractive yields in other DeFi protocols can influence a validator’s decision to unstake. Portfolio Rebalancing: Many large stakers or institutional participants regularly adjust their crypto portfolios. Unstaking ETH might be part of a broader rebalancing strategy. Operational Needs: Validators might need access to their funds for various reasons, including covering operational expenses, personal liquidity, or exiting the validator business entirely. It’s important to note that joining the queue does not automatically imply a bearish outlook. It often reflects strategic financial decisions or a natural cycle within the staking ecosystem. How Does the Unstaking Process Work on Ethereum? Ethereum’s design includes a structured process for unstaking to maintain network stability and security. Validators must explicitly signal their intent to exit, after which they enter the exit queue. The network processes these requests in a controlled manner, preventing sudden, large-scale withdrawals that could impact liquidity or the integrity of the consensus mechanism. The number of validators that can exit per epoch (a 6.4-minute period) is capped, ensuring an orderly release of staked ETH. This mechanism balances validator flexibility with network integrity. The current size of the ETH unstaking queue directly impacts the waiting time for validators, which can range from days to weeks, depending on the volume of pending requests. This design prevents a “bank run” scenario on the staking pool. Potential Impacts of a Growing ETH Unstaking Queue A substantial ETH unstaking queue can have various implications for the Ethereum ecosystem and its participants. Market Dynamics: While a large volume of unlocked ETH could potentially increase selling pressure, historical data suggests that a significant portion is often restaked, redeployed into other DeFi protocols, or simply held. The market typically absorbs these releases without major disruption. Validator Behavior: The queue length can influence new validators considering staking. A longer wait time for exit might deter some potential participants. However, the overall appeal of Ethereum staking remains strong due to its fundamental role in securing the network. Network Perception: While a long queue might appear concerning, it also demonstrates the network’s ability to manage withdrawals effectively and maintain its security mechanisms. It shows that the system is working exactly as designed, providing a controlled exit path for participants. This transparency builds trust in the protocol. Actionable Insights for Ethereum Stakers and Investors For those involved in or considering Ethereum staking, understanding the ETH unstaking queue is crucial. Monitor Queue Lengths: Keep an eye on validator queue metrics from reliable sources like validatorqueue.info to gauge current wait times for unstaking. Understand Your Strategy: If you are a validator, factor potential exit times into your liquidity planning. For investors, understand that ETH unstaking is a normal part of the PoS cycle and not necessarily a bearish signal. Stay Informed: Follow official Ethereum development updates and reputable crypto news sources to stay abreast of network changes and market trends. Conclusion: A Sign of Maturity, Not Alarm The record-breaking ETH unstaking queue , while significant in raw numbers, should be viewed within the broader context of Ethereum’s evolving Proof-of-Stake model. It highlights the flexibility offered to validators and the network’s capacity to manage large-scale movements of capital. Rather than a sign of distress, it represents a mature, functional system where participants can freely manage their staked assets. This ongoing process is vital for the health, decentralization, and long-term stability of the Ethereum blockchain. The network continues to prove its resilience and adaptability. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the ETH unstaking queue? A1: The ETH unstaking queue is a waiting list for validators who wish to withdraw their staked Ethereum (ETH) from the network. After the Shapella upgrade, validators can signal their intent to exit, and their requests are processed in a controlled manner. Q2: Why has the ETH unstaking queue reached a record high? A2: The queue can grow due to various factors, including market volatility prompting rebalancing, changes in staking profitability, portfolio adjustments by large stakers, or individual operational needs requiring access to funds. Q3: How long does it take to unstake ETH? A3: The time it takes to unstake ETH depends on the length of the queue and the network’s processing capacity. It can range from a few days to several weeks, as Ethereum caps the number of validators that can exit per epoch to maintain stability. Q4: Does a large unstaking queue impact ETH’s price? A4: While a large volume of unlocked ETH could theoretically increase selling pressure, historical data shows that much of the unstaked ETH is often restaked, redeployed into other DeFi protocols, or simply held. The market typically absorbs these releases without significant disruption. Q5: Is a long ETH unstaking queue a bad sign for Ethereum? A5: Not necessarily. A long queue indicates a high demand for unstaking, but it also demonstrates that Ethereum’s withdrawal mechanism is functioning as designed, managing large capital movements in a controlled and secure manner. It’s a sign of a mature and resilient network. Did you find this analysis helpful?

U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF products, alongside their Ethereum counterparts, recorded significant net outflows on August 18. This development marked the second consecutive day of such movements, drawing attention from investors and market observers alike. Understanding Recent U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETF Movements On August 18, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF products collectively registered a net outflow of $121.73 million. This trend signals a period of investor caution, following a similar pattern from the previous trading day. Analyzing these figures helps us understand the immediate sentiment within the crypto market. Several key players in the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF space were impacted: BlackRock’s IBIT led the outflows, experiencing a significant $68.64 million departure. ARK Invest’s ARKB also saw substantial outflows, totaling $65.75 million. Interestingly, Bitwise’s BITB bucked the trend, recording a modest $12.66 million inflow, indicating some diversified investor interest. Ethereum ETFs Also Witness Withdrawals It wasn’t just Bitcoin that felt the pressure; U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs also faced considerable withdrawals. These products collectively saw a net outflow of $196.34 million, mirroring the consecutive outflow days observed in their Bitcoin counterparts. This indicates a broader trend across major digital asset ETFs. The Ethereum ETF landscape saw outflows from multiple funds: BlackRock’s ETHA was hit hardest, with $86.87 million in outflows. Fidelity’s FETH followed closely, registering $78.40 million in net withdrawals. Other notable outflows included Grayscale’s ETHE ($18.70 million), Franklin Templeton’s EZET ($6.63 million), VanEck’s ETHV ($4.80 million), and Bitwise’s ETHW ($0.94 million). The remaining Ethereum ETFs reported no change in their holdings for the day. This suggests a concentrated outflow from specific major players in the market. What Drives These Significant ETF Outflows? Understanding why these outflows occur is crucial for investors. Several factors can contribute to a decrease in holdings for U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF and Ethereum ETF products. These movements are often a reflection of the broader market environment and investor behavior. Common reasons for such trends include: Market Sentiment: Broader cryptocurrency market trends often influence ETF flows. If there’s a general downturn or uncertainty, investors might pull back their capital. Profit-Taking: After periods of significant gains, some investors may choose to realize profits, leading to redemptions from their ETF holdings. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic indicators, such as interest rate changes or inflation concerns, can push investors towards perceived safer assets, away from more volatile investments like crypto ETFs. Regulatory Landscape: Shifting regulatory discussions or uncertainties surrounding digital assets can also impact investor confidence in these products. These outflows highlight the dynamic nature of the digital asset market, where investor behavior can rapidly respond to various internal and external cues. Navigating the Landscape of U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs For those invested in or considering U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF products, recent outflows serve as a reminder of market volatility. It is essential to monitor these trends, but also to consider the broader context. While two consecutive days of outflows are noteworthy, they do not necessarily indicate a long-term bearish trend. ETF flows are a snapshot of daily activity, influenced by a multitude of factors. Investors should: Diversify Portfolios: Avoid putting all investments into a single asset class, even within crypto. Spreading investments can mitigate risks. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, regulatory updates, and economic indicators. Knowledge empowers better decision-making. Consider Long-Term Goals: Short-term fluctuations are common in the crypto space. Focus on your long-term investment strategy rather than reacting to every daily change. The emergence of a U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF has provided new avenues for traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin. However, with this accessibility comes the need for informed and strategic decision-making. The recent net outflows from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF and Ethereum ETF products on August 18 highlight the ever-present volatility and responsiveness of the digital asset market. While specific funds like BlackRock’s IBIT and ETHA saw significant withdrawals, it’s crucial to view these movements within the broader context of market dynamics and investor sentiment. Staying informed and maintaining a balanced perspective are key to navigating the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency investments. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF? A U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF is an exchange-traded fund that directly holds Bitcoin, allowing investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without actually owning the cryptocurrency itself. It trades on traditional stock exchanges. Why are ETF outflows significant? ETF outflows are significant because they indicate that more shares of the fund are being redeemed than created, meaning investors are pulling money out. This can reflect a negative sentiment towards the underlying assets or broader market conditions. Are these outflows common for crypto ETFs? Yes, daily inflows and outflows are common for all types of ETFs, including crypto ETFs. The crypto market is known for its volatility, so larger fluctuations in ETF flows can occur in response to market news or price movements. How can investors stay informed about ETF trends? Investors can stay informed by regularly checking financial news outlets, market data providers, and official reports from ETF issuers. Following reputable crypto analysts and financial journalists can also provide valuable insights. Did you find this analysis of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF outflows insightful?

Interestingly, the surge was almost entirely tied to iShares and one particular product under its umbrella. With market prices pushing higher, total assets under management (AuM) reached a historic peak of $244 billion on August 13. Amidst this momentum, Ethereum continued to steal the show. ETH Inflows Smash Records In its latest edition of ‘Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report,’ CoinShares revealed that Ethereum attracted a record $2.87 billion in inflows last week, which accounted for 77% of total market inflows. This pushed its year-to-date figure to a whopping $11 billion. Ethereum’s inflows also dominate relative to assets under management, as it made up 29% compared to Bitcoin’s 11.6%. Inflows into Bitcoin reached $552 million, comparatively smaller than Ethereum’s haul. Short-bitcoin investment vehicles nevertheless gained traction, securing an additional $4 million. Investors continued spreading capital across other assets. For instance, Solana brought in $176.5 million, XRP $125.9 million, followed by Sui at $11.3 million, Chainlink at $1.2 million, and Cardano with $0.8 million. Multi-asset products managed a minor $0.4 million inflow. However, not all assets fared equally. Litecoin experienced outflows of $0.4 million, while Ton registered the steepest reversal, with $1 million withdrawn from funds during the same period. Of the $3.73 billion inflows, the US captured nearly all – about 99%. Other countries contributed smaller portions. Canada followed with $33.7 million, alongside Hong Kong’s $20.9 million and Australia’s $12.1 million. Switzerland also contributed $4.2 million. On the other hand, Sweden reported $49.9 million in outflows, while Brazil recorded $10.6 million exiting investment products over the past week. The subsequent week, however, painted a different picture as markets slid sharply. Crypto Markets Face Fresh Sell-Off Digital asset markets faced turbulence on 18th August as Bitcoin fell from $118K to $115K and Ethereum also dropped from $4,500 to $4,300, triggering over $400 million in long liquidations. The sell-off extended last week’s decline, when Bitcoin retreated 5% from all-time highs amid $1 billion in DeFi liquidations and profit-taking. Funding rates had already hinted at stress, with BTC perpetuals softening since Friday. Deribit’s funding rate, above 20% for most of last week, turned negative by Saturday and echoed a pattern seen before the August 1 drop to $112K. With Jackson Hole looming, QCP Capital stated that traders view the move as pre-event de-risking. Options markets now tilt bearish, and puts are favored across maturities. Still, corporate buyers remain active. Tokyo-listed Metaplanet, for one, added 775 BTC over the weekend.

For traders engaging in derivatives, understanding the concept of crypto perpetual futures liquidation is absolutely crucial. This process can lead to substantial, sudden losses for those who trade with leverage. Grasping the mechanics behind these liquidations is vital for anyone participating in the high-stakes futures market. What Exactly is Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation? Crypto perpetual futures liquidation occurs when a trader’s leveraged position is forcibly closed by an exchange. This action happens because the trader’s margin balance has fallen below a predefined maintenance margin requirement. Exchanges initiate these liquidations automatically to prevent a trader’s account balance from going negative and to ensure that potential losses are covered. Perpetual futures contracts are a unique type of derivative. They allow traders to speculate on a cryptocurrency’s future price without needing to own the underlying asset directly. Unlike traditional futures contracts, perpetual futures have no expiry date. This feature, combined with the use of leverage, makes them incredibly popular but also inherently risky. When market prices move sharply against a trader’s position, especially with high leverage, liquidation becomes a very real and often sudden threat. The Shocking Breakdown: 24-Hour Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation The past 24 hours have witnessed a significant volume of crypto perpetual futures liquidation across several major cryptocurrencies. These figures clearly highlight the market’s recent volatility and the profound impact on leveraged positions. Many traders, particularly those holding long positions, faced unexpected and immediate closures of their trades. Bitcoin (BTC): A staggering $64.81 million in BTC perpetual futures was liquidated. A vast majority, specifically 79.87%, were long positions. This indicates a sharp downturn in Bitcoin’s price, catching bullish traders by surprise. Ethereum (ETH): Ethereum saw the largest liquidation volume, totaling an astonishing $173.52 million. Of this substantial amount, 68.68% were long positions. ETH’s recent price action clearly triggered significant losses for those betting on its upward movement. Solana (SOL): Solana also experienced considerable liquidations, amounting to $20.94 million. An overwhelming 85.02% of these were long positions, showcasing a strong negative price swing for SOL in a short period. These compelling figures underscore the inherent and magnified risks of trading perpetual futures. Even experienced traders can face liquidation if they do not manage their risk effectively. The market’s often unpredictable nature means that sudden price drops can wipe out highly leveraged positions with alarming speed. Why Do These Liquidations Happen So Quickly? Liquidations are a direct and unavoidable consequence of combining leverage with market volatility. When traders utilize leverage, they essentially borrow funds to amplify their potential trading power. While this can dramatically magnify profits during favorable market movements, it equally magnifies losses when the market turns unfavorable. A relatively small price movement against a highly leveraged position can quickly deplete the initial margin a trader has put up. Cryptocurrency exchanges maintain a “maintenance margin” level for all leveraged positions. If your position’s value drops to this critical point, the exchange will typically issue a margin call, requesting you to add more funds. If you fail to add additional capital, or if the price continues to move unfavorably, the exchange automatically liquidates your position. This automated process is designed to protect both the exchange and other traders from significant financial losses. Understanding this fundamental mechanism is absolutely vital to avoid sudden crypto perpetual futures liquidation . Smart Strategies for Navigating Crypto Futures How can traders better manage the substantial risks associated with crypto perpetual futures liquidation ? Effective risk management is not just important; it is paramount. Traders should always meticulously consider the amount of leverage they are using. Higher leverage invariably means a higher and more immediate risk of liquidation. It is often advisable, especially for beginners, to start with significantly lower leverage. Implementing strict stop-loss orders is another crucial and proactive strategy. A stop-loss order automatically closes your position when the price reaches a predetermined, unfavorable level. This action effectively limits potential losses before a full liquidation can occur. Diversifying your portfolio and avoiding the temptation to put all your capital into one highly leveraged trade can also significantly mitigate overall risk. Furthermore, continuously educating yourself on market analysis and understanding broader macroeconomic factors that influence crypto prices can provide a distinct edge in these volatile markets. The recent wave of crypto perpetual futures liquidation serves as a powerful and undeniable reminder of the inherent volatility and magnified risks within the digital asset market. While perpetual futures undoubtedly offer exciting opportunities for amplified gains, they simultaneously demand a rigorous and disciplined approach to risk management. Traders must prioritize a deep understanding of leverage, diligently setting appropriate stop-losses, and continuously monitoring dynamic market conditions to protect their hard-earned capital. Staying informed, exercising extreme caution, and adhering to a well-defined trading plan are unequivocally key to navigating these turbulent waters successfully. Frequently Asked Questions About Crypto Futures Liquidation Here are some common questions about this critical market event: What causes crypto perpetual futures liquidation? Liquidations primarily occur when a trader’s leveraged position loses enough value that their margin balance falls below the exchange’s maintenance margin requirement, often due to significant price movements against their trade. How can I avoid liquidation in futures trading? To minimize liquidation risk, use lower leverage, set stop-loss orders, maintain sufficient margin, and continuously monitor market conditions. What is the difference between perpetual futures and traditional futures? The main difference is that perpetual futures have no expiry date, allowing traders to hold positions indefinitely as long as they meet margin requirements, unlike traditional futures which have a set settlement date. Why were long positions liquidated more in the last 24 hours? The higher liquidation of long positions suggests a dominant downward price movement across BTC, ETH, and SOL during that period, causing traders betting on price increases to lose their margin. Is crypto futures trading suitable for beginners? Crypto futures trading, especially with leverage, carries high risk and is generally not recommended for beginners without a thorough understanding of market dynamics, risk management, and the specific mechanics of derivatives.

In 2028, Floki Inu is predicted to reach a maximum price of $0.000708. FLOKI price can reach a maximum level of $0.000381 and an average trading price of $0.0032 in 2031. Floki Inu is a meme coin driven by its community, the Floki Vikings. Inspired by Shiba Inu, Floki Inu aims to democratize power in the crypto space, pivoting the crypto market away from traditional financial entities. The Floki project ecosystem is diverse. It includes Valhalla, a blockchain combat game that rewards players with Floki tokens, and Floki Places, a store for merchandise and NFTs where purchases can be made using Floki tokens. Additionally, Floki University provides educational resources on the cryptocurrency market and blockchain technology. The recent launch (June 30, 2025) of the Valhalla mainnet of opBNB, coupled with DeFi partnerships like Chainlink, collectively enhances Floki Inu’s value and future potential by driving demand and expanding its use.

Indicators favour sellers, confirming the possibility of a further downtrend for FLOKI. FLOKI on the daily timeframe: Floki Inu sees persistent downtrend with weakening momentum FLOKI’s 1-day chart for August 19 reveals the price has been trapped in a prolonged downward trend, consistently making lower highs and lower lows. The Bollinger Bands are contracting, with the token now trading near the lower band at $0.00009714, indicating oversold conditions that haven’t yet attracted meaningful buying interest. FLOKIUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD’s deep negative territory is most concerning, with the histogram showing red bars that confirm selling momentum remains intact despite the token’s already depressed levels. Volume patterns show sporadic spikes to 21.93M but lack consistency, indicating that neither bulls nor bears show sustained conviction at current levels. FLOKI on the 4-hour timeframe: Short-term indicator reveals consolidation near critical support The 4-hour chart suggests FLOKI has found some stability around the $0.000102 level, forming a horizontal support zone that has been tested multiple times over recent sessions. FLOKIUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The 21-day SMA at $0.00010487 acts as immediate resistance, creating a narrow trading corridor. The Balance of Power shows sellers maintaining a slight edge. Likewise, the on-balance volume reflects the gradual erosion of buying interest.

Any recovery attempt must first overcome the 21-day SMA resistance at $0.000105 before challenging the more significant $0.00011 level. Is Floki Inu a good investment? FLOKI INU could be a big win or a big loss. It’s backed by a strong Floki community and consistent ecosystem developments, which can drive short-and long-term gains. But it’s risky, with price swings and unclear long-term value. Only invest if you’re comfortable with the risk. Will FLOKI reach $0.001? Expert analysis suggests that the $0.001 price point is achievable, provided utility grows and investor interest increases enough to drive FLOKI up ~9x its current market cap. Will Floki reach $0.01? FLOKI would need a $100 billion market cap to hit $0.01, over 100x its current value. Only the top six cryptos have surpassed this level, making it a major challenge without massive growth in adoption and demand. While possible, it’s unlikely in the short term. Does FLOKI have a good long-term future? According to expert analysis, FLOKI has a promising long-term future with consistent growth potential. The coin could reach up to $0.002 within the decade.

50316753,https://square.htx.com/?p=45676,1755575486,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/100/default.png,HTX Ventures Report: Are Tokenized Stocks A Treat or A Trap? A Complete Guide,https://square.htx.com/htx-ventures-report-are-tokenized-stocks-a-treat-or-a-trap-a-complete-guide/,"Foreword Singapore, 15 August, 2025 – Tokenized stocks are rapidly becoming the newest focal point where crypto meets traditional finance. With platforms such as Kraken and Robinhood stepping in, the market is moving to bring U.S. equities, ETFs, and other real-world assets (RWAs) on-chain, aiming to create a 24/7 global capital market powered by blockchain.This surge is fueled by the combined forces of stablecoin adoption, the rise of the global “shadow dollar” system, and the broader wave of real-world asset tokenization. The core logic is straightforward: stablecoins have already built a global shadow dollar network, and tokenized stocks are its natural extension, enabling non-U.S. users to access “shadow Wall Street” directly with USDT, bypassing account openings, remittance barriers, and cross-border settlements. This model not only opens new liquidity channels but also brings regulatory and compliance challenges into sharper focus. Meanwhile, the reverse pathway is also taking shape, with on-chain assets entering traditional markets through compliant restructuring. In a notable move, a Nasdaq-listed company recently rebranded as Tron Inc., integrating its public chain ecosystem and TRX token into its core strategy, a clear sign that the fusion of crypto assets and mainstream finance is no longer just theoretical but is materializing within formal regulatory frameworks. Golden opportunity or hidden trap? The answer depends on whether the loop can be closed: Can real-stock backing and transparent custody be guaranteed? Can liquidity and market-making be sustained long term? Can regional compliance keep pace with innovation? HTX Ventures will break down the business model, market players, regulatory landscape, typical risks, and future evolution in this report, helping you determine whether tokenized stocks are the golden gateway to RWAs or merely a grayscale trap in the capital markets. I. Why Are Crypto Investors Interested in Stocks? Since blockchain’s inception, almost every asset that can be tokenized has either already been or is in the process of being brought on-chain. From the earliest stablecoins to traditional financial assets such as real estate, bonds, and funds, and now the increasingly popular tokenized stocks, every innovation milestone has sought to break down the hurdles and barriers in traditional finance through blockchain. At its core, tokenized stocks are about converting stock assets in the traditional financial market into digital tokens on the blockchain. In this way, 24/7 global trading, fractional share purchases, and more efficient cross-border transactions could become a reality. The reason why this model has drawn much attention is that it directly addresses long-standing pain points faced by retail investors globally, especially those from emerging markets, such as the difficulty in opening accounts, remittance hurdles, and mismatched trading hours. However, tokenized stocks are not a new concept. They first appeared briefly in 2020, when exchanges like FTX and Binance all tried to launch such products but ultimately failed under intense regulatory pressure. II. Lessons from Early Attempts at Tokenized Stocks: FTX and Binance In 2020, FTX was one of the first exchanges to explore tokenized stocks. It partnered with the German securities firm CM-Equity to purchase real shares for custody and then issued tokenized versions of those stocks as ERC-20 tokens, representing companies such as Tesla, Apple, and Coinbase. These tokenized stocks were then sold to global users on its platform. FTX’s initial rollout was impressive and attracted many retail investors from emerging markets. But this model quickly caught the attention of securities regulators in Europe and the U.S. Germany’s BaFin and the U.S. SEC both issued stern warnings that such offerings qualified as public sales of securities, which mandated them to comply with securities regulations and obtain relevant licenses. Unable to meet these compliance requirements, FTX was forced to swiftly delist its tokenized stock products. In 2021, Binance introduced a similar product and used almost the same model to trade tokenized stocks of Tesla, Coinbase, and Apple. However, Binance’s effort was also short-lived and was shut down soon afterward under pressure from regulators across multiple countries. The setbacks faced by FTX and Binance sent a clear signal: the primary challenge facing tokenized stocks is not technology but compliance and regulation. III. Why Are Tokenized Stocks Back in the Spotlight? Despite having previously faced strong regulatory pushback, tokenized stocks made a comeback in 2024–2025, once again becoming the center of market attention. There are four primary reasons behind this: Policy and Political Factors: In 2024, Donald Trump openly endorsed crypto development, fueling market expectations about a more lenient regulatory climate. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce also expressed interest in a regulatory sandbox environment, suggesting a gray zone in policy interpretation. Entry of Traditional Financial Institutions: Traditional giants like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton have begun tokenizing funds, bonds, and other assets through blockchain. Their participation serves as an example, encouraging other traditional players to test the waters. Mature Technical Conditions: Unlike in 2020, rapid advancements in blockchain technologies like Solana, Base, and Arbitrum have slashed on-chain transaction costs, improved speed, and made liquidity easier to achieve. Persistently Strong Demand from Retail Users: Retail investors in regions such as Southeast Asia, South Asia, and the Middle East still have a strong appetite for U.S. stocks. These users hold substantial amounts of USDT but are locked out of traditional U.S. stock markets. Tokenized stocks directly fill this gap. IV. Why Are Tokenized Stocks Closely Tied to the Shadow Dollar System and the Stablecoin Hype? As a “second-layer evolution” of on-chain dollars via stablecoins , tokenized stocks directly convert retail users’ shadow dollars into shadow U.S. stocks, transforming RWAs from “assets in static custody” into “composable dynamic assets”. The hotter stablecoins get, the more room this model has to grow, but at the same time, regulators’ concern over the shadow dollar will rise accordingly. Stablecoins Are Essentially the Global “Gray Channel” of the Shadow Dollar System ● Dollar-pegged stablecoins (USDT and USDC) are no longer just “crypto payment tools”; they now function as “dollar proxies” that bypass traditional cross-border clearing networks. ● In many emerging markets, stablecoins act as local users’ shadow claims on the dollar. In countries like the Philippines, Pakistan, Argentina, and Vietnam, users may not hold local currencies, but with stablecoins, they effectively hold “dollars”. ● Therefore, from a retail investor’s perspective, holding USDT is almost equivalent to having dollar deposits, only more flexible . Users can move in and out of the crypto market at any time and even swap directly into tokenized stocks. ● As soon as tokenized stocks entered the picture, they naturally became a new use case for stablecoins : USDT and USDC could directly represent the on-chain shadow prices of Apple and Tesla, eliminating the need to convert to fiat currency or open an account with a U.S. broker. The Hotter Stablecoins Get, the More Room RWAs Have to Grow ● With a circulation of over $115 billion at one point in 2024, USDT has become the world’s largest “dollar alternative” , circulating much faster than traditional dollar wire transfers. ● With tremendously liquid stablecoins, on-chain RWAs (bonds, funds, real estate, and stocks) naturally need new “reservoirs” ; otherwise, USDT would remain locked in CEXs for futures trading, disconnected from real-world assets. ● Tokenized stocks are one of the most accessible and liquid RWAs in the world. Retail users are already familiar with the underlying assets, and market makers can price them based on actual secondary-market quotes, making them far easier to trade than real estate, art, or accounts receivable. Shadow Dollar System + Tokenized Stocks Turn U.S. Stocks Into Second-Layer Dollar Assets On-Chain ● From a regulatory standpoint, the pairing of tokenized stocks and stablecoins effectively creates a “shadow U.S. capital market”: ○ Stablecoins act as a shadow substitute for the dollar; ○ Tokenized stocks turn the equity returns of U.S. companies into shadow assets; ○ Together, they allow non-U.S. residents to trade “shadow U.S. stocks” with “shadow dollars” 24/7. ● This combination circumvents the U.S. brokerage system, the SWIFT network, and even the U.S.’s direct tax reporting framework (in theory). ● That’s why regulators are highly sensitive to it. What they’re keeping an eye on isn’t just the mechanics of the tokens, but the “spillover of dollar influence “. This Explains Why Kraken, Bybit, Robinhood, and Backed Dare to Make a Comeback in 2024–2025 ● Stablecoins have proven themselves worldwide with fast transactions and convenient cross‑border payments, while on‑chain RWAs now enjoy an endorsement from prominent companies such as BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. ● Platforms like Kraken and Bybit see this “shadow dollar” system as their chance to bring retail users in from the gray zone. ● Robinhood’s pilot launch of tokenized stocks in the EU reflects its confidence in USDT-driven traffic in non-U.S. markets , where it can tap into user groups it previously couldn’t reach through on‑chain notes. V. The Three Main Models of Tokenized Stocks Although “tokenized stocks” sounds simple, it follows more than one path in actual implementation. Depending on whether actual stocks are held in custody and how the tokens are issued and traded on-chain, there are three mainstream approaches in the market: The first is Real Stocks in Custody + On-Chain Token Issuance , the second is the Contract for Difference (CFD) model , and the third is pure DeFi synthetic assets . The three models have respective pros and cons, and the regulatory pressure they are facing, their liquidity design, and user-fit scenarios are also notably different. Understanding these differences is key to making sense of the entire tokenized stock sector. Model 1 | Real Stocks in Custody + On-Chain Token Issuance This is the mainstream approach currently adopted by Kraken and Bybit, and it is the most robust approach from a compliance standpoint. How It Works ● Licensed issuers or brokers (such as Backed Finance or Dinari) purchase real stocks (e.g., Apple or Tesla) from the traditional secondary market. ● These stock assets are then held in custody by regulated custodians (such as BitGo or Anchorage), ensuring that all holdings are authentic and verifiable. ● Based on the shares held in custody, issuers mint corresponding tokens on-chain at a 1:1 ratio. For example, 1 Apple share = 1 AAPLx (or bAAPL), which are deployable on networks like Solana or Base. ● Users can purchase these tokens on platforms like Bybit and Kraken using USDT, thereby indirectly gaining the on-chain assets pegged to real stocks. Key Features This seemingly ideal model actually comes with the following limitations: ● Though pegged to real stocks, most tokens do not grant voting rights or dividends. Platforms like Robinhood and Kraken clearly state on their websites: “This is not shareholder rights.” ● If users wish to redeem tokens for actual stocks, they typically must complete rigorous KYC verification, follow the custodian’s redemption process, and possibly pay extra fees. Some issuers even disallow retail users from redeeming fractional shares. ● Therefore, the vast majority of users purchase these tokens purely to capitalize on stock price fluctuations, and very few actually exercise shareholder rights. Why Are Kraken and Bybit Still Doubling Down on This Model? ● Compliance Buffer : Since the tokens are backed by real stocks held in transparent custody, it is possible to shift most of the responsibility to issuers (e.g., Backed) when under regulatory pressure. ● DeFi Composability : Tokens are transferable on-chain and composable across chains. For example, Kraken’s AAPLx can be sent to a Solana wallet and used for liquidity provision on Jupiter or for yield farming on Kamino. ● Stronger Appeal to Retail Users : Compared to CFDs or synthetic assets, tokenized stocks backed by real stocks sound more authentic, which helps lower users’ psychological barriers and makes market education easier. Special Case | Robinhood’s Full-Chain Integration Approach Robinhood takes an even bolder path. With its U.S. broker license, it is already capable of handling real stock trading and custody in-house. The company is currently developing Robinhood Chain to link stock accounts directly on-chain. It aims to integrate in-house custody, on-chain issuance, and matching, while connecting to Bitstamp for global liquidity. This model is essentially a “brokerage version of Binance Chain”, where Robinhood controls the entire process from note issuance and market-making to data flow, keeping all profits, users, and traffic within its own ecosystem. However, it is worth noting that such a highly closed compliance framework and technical barriers make this model not easily replicable by ordinary exchanges or wallet providers in the short term. The investment required to build this ecosystem is far beyond the reach of smaller players. Model 2 | CFDs: A Simple Wrapper with a Classic Approach Compared with real stocks in custody, CFDs (Contracts for Difference) may seem the simplest but are one of the most widely adopted approaches by exchanges today. How It Works ● Typical players like Bybit CFD and PrimeXBT employ similar structures. ● Users select products like “Apple CFD” via MT5, MT4, or Bybit’s built‑in CFD page and open positions based on expected price movements. ● The counterparty to each trade is the platform itself or an external liquidity provider (LP), without needing to hold the underlying stock or keep physical items in custody. ● Spreads, slippage, and leverage parameters are set entirely by the platform. Trades are essentially bets on prices against the platform or its LPs, without stock delivery or shareholder registration. Why Are CFDs So Popular? ● Fast Deployment : Upon connection to mature LPs and real-time stock data, trading starts once orders are listed. ● Lower Compliance Pressure : In most jurisdictions, CFDs are classified as derivatives. As long as there is no physical stock delivery, they typically fall outside the strictest securities regulations. ● High User Acceptance : Most crypto traders are already familiar with BTC and ETH futures and can switch to U.S. stock futures without extra learning, as the operational logic is identical. Bybit’s Dual-Track Strategy Bybit’s moves in recent months provide a typical example: ● On the one hand, it has partnered with Backed to introduce xStocks (like AAPLx and TSLAx), catering to users who prefer “real-stock backing” and competing directly with platforms like Kraken and Robinhood. ● On the other hand, Bybit has continued to offer its traditional CFD products to meet demand from speculative traders seeking high leverage and around-the-clock opportunities to profit from price swings. This dual-track hybrid model enables Bybit to serve both conservative users who prefer the assurance of real stock-backed assets and high-frequency speculators pursuing leveraged volatility within a single trading system, thus maximizing both liquidity sources and user base. Risks: What Users Should Watch Out For While CFDs are simple and accessible, the risks associated with them must not be overlooked: ● No Shareholder Rights : CFDs grant no voting or dividend rights and are not tied to any shareholder register. ● Counterparty Is the Platform or LPs : User profits mean losses for the platform or LP. If trades are too precise, some platforms may manage their risk through slippage or forced liquidation mechanisms, creating the possibility of negative equity and widened slippage. ● Essentially a Regulated Betting Market: Therefore, CFDs are better suited for short-term trading on price fluctuations and do not share the long-term value characteristics of stocks. Model 3 | Pure On-Chain DeFi Synthetic Assets Compared with the first two models, pure on-chain DeFi synthetic assets represent the most fundamental approach to decentralization. Representative projects include early-stage Mirror Protocol and the currently active Synthetix. How It Works ● Users stake stablecoins (such as UST or sUSD) in smart contracts as collateral to mint synthetic assets. ● The protocol calls oracles to fetch real-time stock prices of underlying assets. For example, Apple stock is traded at $180. ● Based on oracle data, smart contracts automatically mint synthetic tokens for corresponding stocks such as “mAAPL” or “sTSLA”. These tokens only track stock prices and do not represent actual stock ownership. ● Users can use tokens for liquidity provision (LP) through on-chain DEXs (such as Terraswap, Uniswap, Curve), trade freely, or build indices or apply leverage. Key Advantages ● Fully On-Chain : These assets are not reliant on centralized matching or custody, with issuance, circulation, and burns all executed by smart contracts. ● Flexible Composition : These assets can be combined with other modules in the DeFi ecosystem to derive collateralized loans, options, structured products, and more. Limitations and Risks ● No Real-Stock Backing : Synthetic assets depend entirely on oracle-fed prices and have no backing from actual stock ownership. ● High Systemic Risk : If an oracle is compromised or malfunctions, the price peg will fail, and the contract may lose its repayment capacity. ● Liquidity Depletion Risk : Unlike centralized market making, the market depth of on-chain LP hinges on continuous order placement and profit distribution from users. Without sustained incentives, liquidity can drop rapidly. Mirror Protocol’s failure is a classic example: after the collapse of the Terra ecosystem and UST’s depeg, all synthetic stocks on Mirror, like mAAPL and mTSLA, became worthless. Synthetix is still running, with some sAAPL and sTSLA circulating on Optimism and its main protocol as collateral or in synthetic debt pools. However, both its user base and TVL have shrunk dramatically from their peak. Purely DeFi-based tokenized stocks are far less popular than stablecoins and leveraged ETH products. Three Models of Tokenized Stocks Three Models of Tokenized Stocks VI. Players Breakdown: Who Are Involved in this Sector The current wave of tokenized stocks has already formed a clear supply chain, linking upstream issuance, custody, platform liquidity, and end-user distribution . Backed Finance: The Core Issuer Behind the Scenes ● Headquartered in Switzerland, Backed is one of the leading issuers of tokenized stocks. It is purchasing real stocks through traditional brokers and uses Chainlink’s Proof of Reserve (PoR) to disclose custodial details on-chain in real time. ● Its major clients include Kraken, Bybit, and Ondo. Backed’s tokenized stocks are considered “compliant spot assets eligible for listing” that CEXs can list quickly for retail traders. ● The core logic is that issuers bear the responsibility for securities compliance and custody, while CEXs handle only frontend KYC/AML to minimize direct exposure to securities issuance liabilities. Ondo & Securitize: Alliance-Oriented Player and Traditional Digital Securities Service Provider ● Ondo spearheaded the “Global Stocks Alliance”, partnering with Solana Foundation, BitGo, Fireblocks, Jupiter, and others to develop standards for cross-chain operations, custody, and liquidity. ● Securitize is an early player in digital securities, primarily serving traditional enterprises by offering equity tokenization and connecting them with qualified investors. Positioned toward the B2B market, it does not directly target retail users. Dinari: Tackling U.S. Compliance Head-On ● Based in the U.S., Dinari aims to deliver truly compliant tokenized stocks, “dShares”, by obtaining compliant licenses such as Reg D and Reg CF and securing ATS (Alternative Trading System) qualification. ● Unlike Backed, Dinari hopes to offer users optional shareholder privileges (e.g., dividends) in the future. However, the extremely high cost of U.S. compliance poses major challenges, requiring sustained investment in broker licenses, custodial infrastructure, and legal counsel. ● Dinari currently follows a B2B model, partnering with wallets or exchanges to introduce tokenized stocks as white-label products. Kraken: A Leading Compliant CEX ● Kraken has long positioned itself as a compliance-focused CEX, supported by European and U.S. users’ trust in licenses and compliance. ● Its xStocks module works closely with Backed: Backed is responsible for the custody of real stocks, while Kraken provides matching, listing, wallets, and API integration. Its PoR is publicly verifiable, and the tokens can be transferred on-chain to networks like Solana for secondary liquidity through LPs and DEXs. ● Kraken pays special attention to compliance boundaries, implementing IP blocking and timezone-based KYC restrictions for U.S. users to stay clear of SEC red lines. Bybit: Dual-Track Hybrid Strategy Balancing Spot and Derivatives ● The biggest difference between Bybit and Kraken lies in the fact that Bybit operates two parallel product lines: tokenized real stocks and CFDs (Contracts for Difference). ● CFDs are offered by Bybit through integrations with external liquidity providers (such as IS Prime and Finalto) and the MT5 system, catering to the needs of high-frequency speculative traders and generating revenue from spreads and fees. ● For tokenized real stocks, Bybit partners with Backed to list xStocks (like AAPLx and TSLAx), serving users who prefer “real-stock backing”. Both user groups can be converted simultaneously on the platform. Robinhood: Integrated Chain of Proprietary Brokerage ● Robinhood holds a U.S. broker-dealer license, which allows it to offer real stock trading and custody. ● It has developed the Robinhood Chain, moving stock accounts on-chain, supported by its proprietary wallet and trading/matching systems. Pilot programs have been launched in the EU (Robinhood Europe), where over 200 stocks and ETFs are packaged into token products for EU users to trade, thus bypassing U.S. regulation. ● Bitstamp provides a liquidity bridge, allowing users to later use the tokens as collateral or incorporate them into structured products in DeFi scenarios. ● This “internal broker chain” approach enables Robinhood to close the loop across issuance, custody, matching, and liquidity, dramatically improving user retention and data control. However, it requires strong compliance credentials and substantial capital, making it challenging for smaller players to replicate in the short term. Republic: Specializing in Rare Non-Listed Equity ● Unlike other projects that target publicly listed stocks, Republic focuses on tokenizing rare private equity in non-listed companies (such as SpaceX and OpenAI). It typically adopts an SPV (Special Purpose Vehicle) note model, allowing retail investors to invest indirectly in equities that were previously out of reach. ● The risk lies in potential authorization issues for certain private equity tokens. For instance, OpenAI has publicly stated that related products launched by Robinhood Europe were unauthorized, and the SEC has launched an investigation. VII. Global Regulatory Overview U.S.: Securities Law as a Hard Constraint ● Core Principle : Tokenized stocks ≠ non-securities. As long as stocks are mirrored into tokens, and related products and services are offered to U.S. users, SEC securities regulations are automatically triggered. ● Compliance Requirements : Issuing and selling tokenized stocks requires a broker-dealer license, ATS (Alternative Trading System) license, and a custody and information disclosure architecture in line with securities law. Meanwhile, compliance counsel is also required to review the issuance documentation. ● Regulatory Stance: The SEC has always made its stance clear – “Tokenization doesn’t change the nature of the underlying asset.” ● Lessons Learned : FTX and Binance attempted tokenized stock offerings in 2020–2021, but they lacked proper compliance credentials. Under pressure from the SEC, FINRA, and BaFin, they were ultimately forced to delist the products. EU: Dual Oversight under MiFID II and MiCA ● MiFID II : Any product that involves securities sales and targets retail or institutional investors must strictly comply with the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive. It is prohibited to label something a “token” to evade existing obligations under securities law. ● MiCA : MiCA primarily governs crypto assets and stablecoins, but tokenized stocks with real equity backing may also fall under its regulatory framework. ● Regional Practice : Robinhood Europe has carried out pilot programs in the EU, offering tokenized stock products through an SPV structure. Once a token is deemed to represent an actual security, additional exemptions should be applied for or information should be fully disclosed as per local requirements. Asia and the Middle East: Active Gray-Zone Pilots ● Regulators, including Singapore’s MAS, Switzerland’s FINMA, and the UAE’s ADGM/DFSA, have created regulatory sandboxes for RWAs (real-world assets), allowing small-scale pilot tokenization programs, provided they mainly target non-U.S. clients and qualified regional investors. ● Hong Kong remains cautious on security tokenization. Most RWA activity there centers on bonds, funds, and structured notes, with large-scale tokenized stock operations yet to be approved. VIII. Real-World Use Cases | How Global Retail and Institutions Are Participating The adoption of tokenized stocks extends beyond retail investors. From individual traders to high-frequency speculators, from small and medium-sized CEXs and regional wallets to traditional brokers and DeFi protocols, everyone can find their own entry points and viable paths in this sector. 1. Ordinary Retail Investors ● The most straightforward use case is to buy small amounts of xStocks, using USDT to access tokenized stocks of companies like Apple and Tesla and track their price fluctuations. ● The primary demand is to address the pain point of users who don’t have U.S. brokerage accounts but want a low-barrier way to get started. ● Key Understanding : It is important to clarify that holding tokens does not confer shareholder rights such as dividends or voting rights. 2. High-Frequency Speculators ● This group focuses on tokenized stocks in order to exploit short-term price spreads and volatility arbitrage. ● CFDs are the most suitable, as they support leverage, flexible hedging, and T+0 position closing. ● Key Understanding : Traders must grasp slippage, leverage risk, and counterparty trading mechanisms where positions are taken against them to avoid forced liquidation or negative equity. 3. Small and Medium-Sized Exchanges/Regional CEXs ● Without full broker-dealer licenses, these platforms can adopt a hybrid model combining CFDs and tokenized partnerships. ● They provide spot and CFD matching at the frontend and partner with issuers like Backed and Dinari at the backend to onboard real note-backed tokens, capturing gray-zone traffic and earning fee revenue. ● Key Understanding : It is essential to define reasonable service regions to steer clear of strictly regulated markets like the U.S. 4. Traditional Brokers ● Brokers with mature legal and financial capabilities favor a model combining self-built chains and proprietary licenses. ● Robinhood and Bitstamp are already exploring this path in European and U.S. markets: On-chain accounts and in-house custody allow them to profit from both matching and custody. ● Key Understanding : Mature licensing systems, compliant custody, and multi-jurisdictional legal support are needed. 5. Wallets/Agents ● In emerging markets, some wallets or OTC teams prefer to use white-label tokenized products and list notes from issuers like Kraken or Backed into their own apps or mini-programs to capture traffic and earn matching commissions. ● This model works especially well in regions like Pakistan or the Philippines where retail investors face high barriers to opening accounts and gray-market demand is high. ● Key Understanding : It is critical to find credible issuers and ensure compliance to mitigate local regulatory risk. 6. DeFi Protocols ● Tokenized stock assets can be combined with on-chain bonds or stablecoins to serve as essential building blocks for composite derivatives within the DeFi ecosystem. ● Common use cases include providing bilateral liquidity in LP pools or serving as collateral and leverage within lending protocols like Aave and Compound. ● Key Understanding : The security of oracles and clearing mechanisms must be ensured to avoid oracle attacks or price failures that hit projects like Mirror. How Different Investors Participate in Tokenized Stocks IX Risk Points | Truths and Common Pitfalls While tokenized stocks may seem to offer global users a convenient channel to trade U.S. stocks, the underlying risks and operational hurdles are often underestimated. Below are the five key risks to watch out for: Risk 1 | Most Tokens Do Not Grant Shareholder Rights Platforms such as Robinhood, Backed, and Kraken clearly state in their official FAQs: “This token does not represent actual shareholder rights.” In other words, users only hold on-chain instruments pegged to stock prices and are not shareholders in the traditional sense. ● Users cannot automatically access companies’ annual reports, participate in AGMs (Annual General Meetings), or vote as shareholders; ● Dividends are generally excluded unless the issuer has explicitly designed a profit-sharing mechanism, which is extremely rare in reality. Therefore, for most users, what they hold is merely a price proxy , rather than an actual shareholder stake. Risk 2 | Redeeming Real Stocks Is Far More Complicated Than It Seems Although most tokenized note products theoretically support 1:1 redemption, the barriers are high in practice: ● There is usually a minimum redemption threshold (e.g., at least 1 share, with some products requiring 100 shares or more); ● Cooling-off periods are often imposed, ranging from 30 to 90 days; ● Users must redo full KYC, submitting documents like proof of address; ● Most redemptions incur additional fees, typically ranging from 0.5% to 2% of the face value. As a result, the vast majority of retail users rarely opt for redemption in practice. Risk 3 | Insufficient Liquidity Can Lead to “Empty Pools” Although tokenized stocks are traded through on-chain liquidity pools or CEXs, actual order book depth is often limited: ● For example, the main LP pools of Backed’s AAPL and TSLA on Solana generally hold only a few million dollars; ● Day-to-day market-making is largely sustained by orders from a small number of liquidity providers such as Kraken or Bitstamp; ● Once mainstream market makers pull out or an exchange delists a token, users may have to offload their holdings through OTC or other non-mainstream channels, significantly heightening liquidity risk. Risk 4 | Oracle Failures Pose Critical Hidden Threat to On-Chain Synthetic Assets Pure DeFi synthetic assets rely on oracles like Chainlink and Pyth to feed real-time stock prices. In cases of false pricing attacks, API errors, or oracle manipulations, the synthetic tokens minted by smart contracts will no longer be accurate: ● A classic example is the Mirror Protocol in the Terra ecosystem: After UST depegged and LUNA collapsed, oracle failures caused many synthetic assets like mAAPL and mTSLA to plunge to zero. Risk 5 | Cross-Border Compliance and Regulatory Crackdowns Can Happen Anytime Tokenized stock projects can trigger oversight from regulators such as the SEC and FINRA as soon as they target U.S. residents or involve cross‑border securities sales: ● Robinhood Europe launched tokenized shares of OpenAI and SpaceX without official authorization. Regarding this, OpenAI has publicly denied issuing such shares, and a regulatory investigation has been triggered. ● Cases like Binance and FTX offer valuable lessons. The former was forced to delist, while the latter ultimately faced bankruptcy liquidation due to compliance failures. X. Future Outlook | Three Potential Evolution Paths As part of RWAs, tokenized stocks are just getting started. Over the next three years, it may evolve along three primary paths: Scenario A | Brokers Go On-Chain with Proprietary Closed Loops Robinhood is highly likely to double down on its all-in strategy: building its own blockchain, securing compliance licenses, managing custody of real stocks in-house, issuing tokens on-chain, and integrating matching and settlement into a proprietary system. If the SEC allows for greater flexibility in compliance pathways, Robinhood could achieve a fully integrated “broker + wallet + blockchain” stack. If successful, this path would resemble a “compliant Binance Smart Chain”, with the key distinction that its underlying assets would be real stocks and ETFs rather than crypto-native tokens. Scenario B | Breakthroughs First Made in Regional Gray Markets Regions such as Abu Dhabi, Singapore, and Switzerland have already incorporated RWAs into their official innovation pilots, opening the door for early experimentation with the implementation models of tokenized stocks and other gray-zone assets. In the future, we may see more region-specific models: ● Americas and the EU will primarily rely on local licensing systems and domestic brokers; ● Emerging markets in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Africa are poised to become major distribution hubs for tokenized stocks operating in regulatory gray zones worldwide. Kraken, Bybit, Ondo, and other platforms are expected to intensify their presence in these regulatory gray zones, focusing on non-U.S. user traffic and the opportunities created by licensing flexibility. Scenario C | DeFi Composition and Modular Pathways If the DeFi space continues to gain momentum in the new cycle, tokenized stocks may evolve into composable financial Lego blocks, becoming an integral part of on-chain RWA composition strategies. ● For example, tokenized bonds (e.g., Ondo T-bills), tokenized stocks (e.g., Backed AAPLx), and stablecoins (e.g., USDC) can be bundled into structured on-chain notes or index products. ● Tokenized stocks can also be added to liquidity pools (LPs) for bilateral market-making, providing greater depth for on-chain funds. ● Users can also use these assets as collateral in lending protocols such as Aave and Compound to enable higher leverage, creating more complex, yield-generating strategies within the DeFi ecosystem. Once this DeFi composition pipeline is fully operational, on-chain RWAs will no longer be simply about note issuance or unidirectional transfers; they will form a closed-loop liquidity system that is collateralizable, composable, and redistributable. Scenario D | Non-Compliant Perpetual Futures and Gray-Zone Matching Apart from mainstream compliance pathways and on-chain DeFi composition, a gray-zone branch remains active in the market and should not be overlooked: If regulatory pressure fails to create globally consistent constraints, we may see the rise of small and medium-sized trading platforms offering non-compliant perpetual stock futures . ● These platforms may operate as CEXs or depend on anonymous on-chain derivatives protocols, directly tapping retail capital flows and offering matching services for perpetual stock futures with USDT. ● Perpetual futures function much like traditional CFDs but can be designed with higher leverage, automatic renewal, and no requirement for holding real stocks or custodial assets. They are purely instruments for price speculation. ● Some projects may encapsulate their frontends on-chain (e.g., cross-chain DEXs or anonymous derivatives pools), leveraging on-chain liquidity and anonymous accounts to attract risk-seeking users while minimizing the cost of compliance traceability. Once the market’s demand for short-term leverage on tokenized stocks continues to rise, these non-compliant matching and perpetuals may quickly gain traction in regional markets, serving as a gray-zone workaround that circumvents regulation and satisfies the needs of high-frequency speculators. Nonetheless, this branch is also extremely risky: Any involvement of cross-border fund flows or U.S. users may trigger compliance actions from regulators such as the SEC, CFTC, or other jurisdictional bodies at any time. Users then face potential losses from sudden liquidity crunches, platform shutdowns, or extreme slippage. XI. Reverse Integration: When On-Chain Assets Begin Entering the Stock Market If tokenized stocks represent the migration of traditional financial assets onto the blockchain, something that happened recently may mark the beginning of a reverse trend: On-chain assets are now attempting to penetrate the traditional financial system , seeking to establish their credibility in mainstream capital markets through more compliant and structured means. On July 25, a Nasdaq-listed company formerly known as SRM Entertainment officially rebranded as Tron Inc. and adopted a new ticker symbol, TRON. The company announced the divestment of its toy business and restructured its core assets around a TRX treasury strategy to support the development of the TRON DAO ecosystem, using TRX, the native token of the TRON blockchain, as its primary strategic reserve asset. It currently holds more than 365 million TRX, which are staked and managed through on-chain protocols such as JustLend to generate returns. The day the news broke, Tron Inc.’s stock price surged by more than 55% , becoming the talk of the market. This not only represents a high-profile comeback of a crypto firm through a backdoor listing but also signals that on-chain native assets are exploring new avenues for building compliant financial structures. It is worth noting that this is not the first time a publicly listed traditional company has disclosed its crypto holdings. Back in 2020, MicroStrategy became the exemplar of “crypto-holding listed company” for its ongoing BTC purchases, which were fully reflected in its financial reports. Companies like Tesla, Block, and Coinbase have also reported holdings of BTC, ETH, or stablecoins in their financial reports. What sets Tron Inc. apart from these companies is that: ● It is among the few listed companies whose core assets are public-chain tokens (TRX), with a corporate strategy centered on building an on-chain ecosystem. ● The project team does not hold direct equity but exerts “shadow control” through DAO governance and advisory structures, seeking to bridge on-chain governance with traditional equity structures under a compliant framework. ● Its asset operations rely more heavily on on-chain protocols (e.g., JustLend), and its yield mechanisms are more natively Web3. This type of operation is no longer mere capital maneuvering but an active reshaping of the narrative: transforming tokenized assets into financial units that are recognizable, measurable, and compliantly tradable in traditional financial structures. Following stablecoins and crypto treasuries, this may become the next proving ground for connecting public blockchain ecosystems with TradFi. Thus, we are now witnessing a “two-way embedding” between tokenized stocks and equitized on-chain assets: ● On the one hand, real-world assets like U.S. stocks and bonds are being brought on-chain, enriching the on-chain finance ecosystem and strengthening its ties to reality; ● On the other hand, native crypto assets are making their way into mainstream capital markets through compliant pathways, gaining additional liquidity and institutional backing. This trend is no longer just an idea on paper. Instead, it is gradually materializing through cases such as exchanges like Kraken and Bybit promoting the tokenization of real stocks, and Tron Inc. going public via a backdoor listing. Together, they sketch out an early blueprint of an “on-chain Wall Street”: a bridge between decentralized asset structures and traditional market architectures. Whether this ecosystem will eventually form a closed loop will depend on market-making capabilities, the regulatory climate, and the resilience of its institutional design. However, one thing is certain: the line between tokens and stocks is being redrawn. XII. Conclusion | Treat or Trap? It All Comes Down to the Closed Loop and Structural Design From the tokenization of real stocks driven by Kraken, Bybit, and Robinhood, to the compliant token issuance roles undertaken by Backed, Dinari, and Ondo, and finally to the reverse entry of on-chain assets into traditional markets represented by Tron Inc., the real competitive edge in this round of asset restructuring has never been just about smart contracts or product design; it lies in whether a complete on-chain financial closed loop can be built and sustained. From a macro perspective, this model is a second-layer extension of the stablecoin system: Stablecoins have enabled global retail traders to bypass traditional bank settlement networks, while tokenized stocks now connect these shadow dollars to “shadow U.S. stocks”. Together, the two form a kind of on-chain “Gray Wall Street”, breaking apart the closed-off capital markets of the real world into a 24/7, modular, composable on-chain marketplace. For this model to truly take root, it requires a clear chain of accountability and strong compliance backing: Real equity backing is essential to preventing hollow arbitrage; transparency in custody and issuance is critical to maintaining user trust; sustained market-making and liquidity are needed to support on-chain trading depth; and regional licenses together with cross-border compliance mechanisms are required to mitigate constraints imposed by the SEC, the EU, and other regulators worldwide. Any slip in this process could render users’ notes worthless, turning them into stranded assets that grant no rights and cannot be redeemed. For retail traders, tokenized stocks may be nothing more than a speculative channel for testing gray-zone pathways, while genuine shareholder status and long-term returns remain rooted in traditional brokerage systems. For small and medium-sized CEXs, wallets, OTC desks, and DeFi protocols, this may be the fastest way to activate dormant stablecoin liquidity in the wallets and rapidly plug into the RWA sector. Conversely, Tron Inc. has provided a radical yet pragmatic possibility: bringing crypto into traditional capital markets and establishing an institutional connection with stocks. Whether it’s a treat or a trap ultimately hinges on who can build a bidirectional, composable, and operational closed-loop structure. Those who successfully navigate this path may be the ones to lead the next wave of assets and liquidity. —————————————- About HTX Ventures HTX Ventures, the global investment division of HTX , integrates investment, incubation, and research to identify the best and brightest teams worldwide.

With hype building around the next big memecoin and the promise of Layer 2 scalability, many analysts are speculating that $LBRETT could be the next 100x altcoin. The project’s ongoing crypto presale and staking rewards have drawn significant investor interest, especially as traditional coins like SOL see sentiment shaken by the recent ETF delay. Could this be the moment when Ethereum Layer 2 innovation leaves legacy chains behind? Solana price prediction and the Layer Brett effect The Solana Price Prediction narrative has shifted as investors react to the ETF delay and growing competition from Layer 2 projects. SOL, often praised for its high throughput and ecosystem upgrades, now faces a fresh wave of competition as new Layer 2 crypto solutions like Layer Brett gain traction. While SOL has seen periods as a top gainer crypto and remains a favorite among DeFi coin enthusiasts, the emergence of Ethereum Layer 2 projects is causing some to reconsider their long-term positions. Many are watching to see if SOL can maintain its market cap lead or if it will cede ground to newer, faster altcoins offering low gas fee crypto transactions and dynamic staking crypto rewards. Recent market activity suggests that the focus is shifting toward platforms that blend meme culture with real blockchain utility. The rise of Layer Brett is a clear example, as its presale momentum and unique value propositions draw investor attention away from even established coins like SOL.

This latest transaction highlights a shrewd strategy that has yielded remarkable returns for the firm. The recent sale involved 5,000 ETH, valued at an impressive $21.56 million, undertaken specifically to secure profits. How Does Longling Capital Manage Its ETH Holdings? Over the past two years, Longling Capital has demonstrated a clear and consistent approach to managing its Ethereum assets. Their strategy involves calculated withdrawals and deposits, timed to maximize gains from market fluctuations. This long-term engagement with the ETH market has allowed them to accumulate significant wealth. Initially, the firm withdrew a staggering 123,405 ETH from Binance. This large sum, valued at approximately $290 million at the time, was acquired at an average price of $2,349 per ETH. Their disciplined approach involved holding these assets through various market cycles, waiting for opportune moments to optimize their positions. Unpacking Longling Capital’s Astounding Profit The recent Longling Capital sale is just one piece of a much larger, highly profitable puzzle. The firm has successfully re-deposited a substantial portion of its holdings back onto exchanges, demonstrating a clear profit-taking mechanism. This careful management has resulted in a truly impressive financial outcome. Longling Capital later deposited 70,800 ETH back onto exchanges. These deposits were made at a significantly higher average price of $3,502 per ETH , valuing them at $248 million. Based on these figures, the estimated profit secured by Longling Capital stands at an astounding $184 million . This figure underscores the success of their strategic trading. What Can We Learn from Longling Capital’s Strategy? The actions of firms like Longling Capital offer valuable insights into sophisticated crypto investment strategies. Their ability to consistently withdraw and deposit large sums, securing substantial profits, provides a case study for market participants. It emphasizes the importance of long-term vision combined with timely execution. This approach involves: Market Observation: Closely monitoring price trends and market sentiment to identify opportunities. Strategic Entry and Exit Points: Identifying optimal times to acquire assets at lower prices and sell them at higher valuations. Profit Realization: Actively taking profits rather than solely holding assets indefinitely, ensuring capital gains are secured. While the scale of Longling Capital’s operations is immense, the underlying principles can be adapted by individual investors. Understanding market cycles and having a clear profit-taking strategy are crucial elements for success in the volatile crypto space.

50317042,547523,1755576018,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50317042.jpeg,15-Week Crypto Inflow Streak Ends with a $223M Shock Withdrawal,https://bitcoinist.com/15-week-crypto-inflow-streak-ends-with-a-223m/,"The crypto asset investment market experienced its first weekly outflows in over three months, according to the latest data released by CoinShares, a leading European asset manager specializing in cryptocurrencies. The firm’s weekly report shows that digital asset investment products recorded net outflows of $223 million during the past week , halting a 15-week streak of positive inflows. CoinShares attributed the shift to changing investor sentiment in the second half of the week, particularly following key US macroeconomic events. James Butterfill, Head of Research at CoinShares, explained that the market started on a strong note with $883 million in inflows, but sentiment turned negative after a hawkish Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting and stronger-than-expected US economic data dampened risk appetite. “The reversal came swiftly, with over $1 billion in outflows recorded on Friday alone,” Butterfill noted in the report. Bitcoin Sees Largest Outflows Amid Market Reactions Bitcoin, which has historically been the most sensitive crypto asset to monetary policy changes, bore the brunt of last week’s negative flows. The asset saw $404 million in outflows, marking one of the largest weekly pullbacks in recent months. Despite this, year-to-date inflows remain strong , standing at $20 billion, signaling sustained long-term interest from institutional investors. CoinShares highlighted that the sudden shift could be partly due to profit-taking following a period of significant market inflows. Over the last 30 days alone, digital asset products attracted $12.2 billion, representing half of the total inflows for 2025 to date. The report suggested that after such a sharp accumulation phase, it is not uncommon for investors to lock in gains amid increased macroeconomic uncertainty . Altcoins Maintain Resilient Inflows Despite Market Pullback While Bitcoin experienced notable outflows, other leading altcoins continued to attract capital. Ethereum recorded $133 million in net inflows, marking its 15th consecutive week of positive investment flows, which is seen as a sign of growing confidence in its long-term adoption prospects. Other assets, including XRP ($31.2 million), Solana ($8.8 million), and SEI ($5.8 million), also posted positive inflows, suggesting that investor interest in diversified crypto exposure remains intact. Aave and Sui saw smaller but still positive inflows of $1.2 million and $0.8 million, respectively. Despite last week’s overall outflows, CoinShares maintains that broader sentiment toward digital assets remains constructive, with total assets under management for crypto investment products still well above last quarter’s levels. The report emphasized that digital asset products are likely to remain highly sensitive to macroeconomic policy developments, particularly US Federal Reserve decisions on interest rates. The report also highlighted that the combination of strong year-to-date inflows and occasional profit-taking is likely to persist as investors adjust positions based on shifting economic signals .

50317063,https://timestabloid.com/?p=79131,1755576035,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"7 Best Crypto Investments Right Now — XRP, SEI and MAGACOIN FINANCE Backed by Whales",https://timestabloid.com/7-best-crypto-investments-right-now-xrp-sei-and-magacoin/,"Crypto markets are still choppy, but that hasn’t stopped whales from moving. When big wallets shift billions, smaller investors usually pay attention — and the patterns right now are hard to miss. XRP is seeing some of the heaviest accumulation in months, SEI has clawed its way back into breakout territory, and MAGACOIN FINANCE has burst onto the scene with one of the fastest-selling presales of 2025. Alongside blue-chip names like Ethereum, Solana, Toncoin, and Avalanche, these tokens are shaping the shortlist of coins that traders say could lead the next bull run. XRP — Whales Absorb the Panic Despite August’s turbulence, XRP’s chart tells a different story behind the scenes. More than 440 million XRP changed hands into whale wallets during recent sell-offs — a sign of quiet confidence from the biggest players. The token currently hovers between $2.95 and $3.14, with analysts eyeing a rebound to the $4.00–$4.47 zone if market sentiment steadies. The thesis is simple: when whales lean in this heavily, they’re often preparing for a breakout. Ripple’s growing role in cross-border payments only strengthens that view. SEI — Quietly Building Momentum SEI isn’t the loudest name in the room, but it’s making noise in the right circles. The Layer-1 token has snapped out of a long downtrend, drawing smart money inflows and renewed optimism from traders. Due to this, market forecasts suggest gains of up to 160%, with targets around $0.90 in 2025. Undoubtedly, EI’s appeal lies in speed and scalability, the same qualities that once propelled Solana. For those who can stomach risk, SEI is emerging as one of the higher-upside plays outside the top 20 coins. MAGACOIN FINANCE — The Crypto Presale That Won’t Slow Down XRP and SEI might be showing strength, but MAGACOIN FINANCE has something neither of them does, which is a crypto presale that’s already rewriting expectations. Wallet activity is surging, allocations are selling out fast, and both retail and whale buyers are jumping in before listings. Analysts project as much as 35x upside, citing MAGACOIN’s viral branding and capped supply as the twin forces behind its rise. Notably, the project blends meme energy with DeFi-style tokenomics, positioning it as the most aggressive new entrant of 2025. It’s not for the faint of heart, but for those chasing asymmetric bets, MAGACOIN is quickly becoming the coin speculators don’t want to miss. Ethereum — Shrinking Supply, Growing Demand Ethereum continues to play its role as the bedrock of DeFi and stablecoin. With exchange balances at multi-year lows and institutional ETFs pulling in steady inflows, ETH is showing the slow, relentless accumulation pattern of a blue-chip asset. So, investors looking for stability with upside still treat the top crypto asset as a must-own. Solana — Proving It’s Not a Fad Solana has had its setbacks, but the network’s developer ecosystem hasn’t slowed. Gaming and NFTs remain strong points, and whale activity is beginning to reflect that optimism. Essentially, SOL still has a seat at the table for traders who want exposure to high-performance chains. Toncoin — The Social Network Play Few projects can tap into an existing user base the size of Telegram’s 800 million accounts. Toncoin does just that. By embedding its wallet directly into the app, TON has turned itself into a native payments and DeFi rail with instant distribution. That kind of reach makes it unique among altcoins. Avalanche — Betting on Infrastructure Avalanche’s subnet architecture keeps attracting builders, giving it a long-term edge as an infrastructure play. After retracing in previous cycles, AVAX now sits undervalued relative to its potential, making it a contrarian bet for investors who prefer the “picks and shovels” side of blockchain. The Bottom Line Each coin on this list offers something different: XRP has whale confidence, SEI is clawing back into form, and Ethereum and Solana bring scale and credibility. Toncoin and Avalanche cover real-world integration and infrastructure growth. But the wildcard is clear: MAGACOIN FINANCE is the new entry that’s turned heads this quarter. It combines an energetic crypto presale frenzy with whale momentum, giving it a unique position on the list of 2025’s best crypto bets. If XRP brings clarity and SEI brings speed, MAGACOIN FINANCE brings the early-stage energy that often sparks the biggest gains.

The token’s seven-day retracement likewise sits at 4.50%, and it is down about 35.5% year-to-date while trading outside the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap. At the time of reporting, SHIB’s market price was $0.00001261. Related Reading: After Monero Hit, Qubic Group Puts Dogecoin On Target List Shiba Inu Weekly Support Levels Hold Analyst MMB Trader has pointed to two weekly support lines at $0.000010 and $0.000007 that have repeatedly absorbed selling pressure. SHIB dropped to $0.00000714 in July 2022 after an 88% fall from its 2021 peak of $0.00008854, and buyers pushed it back up. The popular memecoin came back to that area in June and October 2023 and regained footing. This year, the token revisited around $0.000010 in March, April, and June and bounced each time. Those moves suggest there are price zones where demand has shown up. Analyst’s Targets And Recent History Based on reports, the analyst laid out a step-up of targets if SHIB clears its descending trendline. The first target is $0.00003364, a close to 170% rise from $0.00001249 at the time of reporting. The next level is $0.00005480, an increase of approximately 330%, and a distance benchmark at $0.00007716 suggests around 500% increase. SHIB’s own past provides some background: it climbed from $0.00000967 to $0.00004567 on March 5, 2024, on a meme-coin frenzy, and regained to $0.00003343 in December 2024 before again retreating. Models also give more modest short-term views; one forecast puts SHIB at $0.00001324 by September 17, 2025. Big swings have happened here before, but they came with heavy volume and wide attention. Related Reading: XRP’s Toughest Bull Run Could Lead To Big Gains, Analyst Claims Market Snapshot And Close Current sentiment measures look mixed. The Fear & Greed Index reads 60, which sits in the Greed zone, while technical indicators show a Bearish tilt at the moment. SHIB recorded 14/30 green days (47%) and roughly 7.02% price volatility over the last 30 days. Traders should note that those readings can flip quickly. If weekly support holds and a catalyst pushes volume up, the mood could shift. If those supports fail, the picture could darken fast. Meanwhile, volume and on-chain flows will be crucial going forward. A breakout candle that lacks rising volume may not last. Watch exchange inflows and whale transfers because large moves onto exchanges often precede selling.

For a long time, the crypto world operated with minimal oversight, leading to concerns about investor safety. However, a significant shift is underway, particularly in Illinois, where groundbreaking efforts are strengthening crypto consumer protections . This move marks a pivotal moment, setting a precedent for how states can safeguard their citizens in the rapidly expanding digital economy. Why Are Crypto Consumer Protections So Important? In the past, the lack of clear regulations in the crypto space often left consumers vulnerable. Fraud, hacks, and insufficient recourse for victims were common issues. This created an environment where trust could be easily eroded. Therefore, robust crypto consumer protections are not just about compliance; they are about building a secure and trustworthy ecosystem where individuals can engage with digital assets confidently. These new laws aim to bridge the gap between traditional financial safeguards and the innovative world of cryptocurrency. Governor JB Pritzker of Illinois recently took a decisive step, signing two crucial bills into law. These legislative actions reflect a commitment to creating a safer environment for anyone interacting with digital assets, ensuring that Illinois residents benefit from the innovation of crypto without facing undue risks. This progressive stance contrasts sharply with previous federal approaches that favored deregulation, signaling a clear direction for the state’s financial future. Unpacking the Digital Assets and Consumer Protection Act One of the cornerstone pieces of legislation is the Digital Assets and Consumer Protection Act (DACPA). This act grants significant authority to the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (IDFPR) over crypto exchanges and businesses operating within the state. The goal is to bring these digital asset firms in line with the standards expected of traditional financial institutions. Key provisions of DACPA include: Financial Safeguards: Firms must maintain adequate financial reserves to protect customer funds. Cybersecurity Measures: Strict protocols are required to prevent data breaches and unauthorized access. Anti-Fraud Measures: Companies must implement robust systems to detect and prevent fraudulent activities. Risk Disclosure: Businesses must clearly inform consumers about the inherent risks associated with crypto investments. Customer Service Standards: Companies are expected to provide responsive and effective customer support, mirroring traditional finance. This comprehensive approach to crypto consumer protections ensures that firms are accountable and that consumers have clear avenues for assistance and recourse. Regulating Crypto ATMs: The Digital Asset Kiosk Act Beyond exchanges, the second bill, the Digital Asset Kiosk Act, specifically targets the growing number of crypto ATMs. These kiosks, while convenient, have sometimes been exploited for scams, leaving victims with little recourse. Illinois is now stepping up to regulate this segment, enhancing crypto consumer protections at the point of transaction. The new regulations for crypto ATMs include: Operator Registration: All crypto ATM operators must register with the state, increasing transparency. Refund Obligations: Operators are now mandated to provide refunds to victims of scams facilitated through their kiosks. Fee Cap: A significant measure is the 18% fee cap on transactions, preventing exorbitant charges. Daily Transaction Limit: For new users, a $2,500 daily transaction limit is imposed, acting as a safeguard against large, potentially fraudulent transactions. These measures are designed to curb illicit activities and ensure fair practices for individuals using crypto ATMs, making them a safer entry point into the digital asset world. What Do These Crypto Consumer Protections Mean for You? For residents of Illinois, these new laws bring a much-needed layer of security and trust to the crypto landscape. Whether you are an experienced investor or new to digital assets, you can now interact with greater confidence, knowing that specific safeguards are in place. The state’s proactive stance on crypto consumer protections serves as a model for other jurisdictions considering how to regulate this dynamic industry effectively. Governor Pritzker emphasized that these are “common-sense protections for investors and consumers.” This legislation highlights a growing recognition among policymakers that while innovation is vital, it must be balanced with robust oversight to prevent harm. As the crypto market continues to mature, such regulatory frameworks will play a crucial role in fostering broader adoption and ensuring long-term stability. Summary of Enhanced Security Illinois has truly set a benchmark with its comprehensive approach to digital asset regulation. By signing the Digital Assets and Consumer Protection Act and the Digital Asset Kiosk Act, Governor Pritzker has championed significant crypto consumer protections . These laws not only provide clarity for businesses but also empower consumers with greater security, transparency, and recourse. This proactive legislative action is a testament to Illinois’ commitment to fostering a responsible and secure digital economy for everyone. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are the two new crypto bills signed in Illinois?

Whale wallets added 1.1 million LINK this week, showing strong confidence despite minor pullbacks. Chainlink leads RWA development with new ETF data feeds, boosting its institutional adoption narrative. Breakout Clears Long-Term Resistance Chainlink (LINK) has gained over 18% in the past week and is currently trading around $25. The move followed a breakout above a key resistance area between $20 and $21. This zone had previously rejected the price multiple times since early 2025. Notably, the breakout came with strong volume, pushing the asset well above the 200-day moving average. The green zone on the chart marked a supply region, which is now acting as support. The current structure shows price consolidating after the breakout, holding above support for now. Targets and Scenarios Analysts expect a move to $29 if the broader market holds steady. Crypto analyst Emperor said , “If BTC holds $115,000 and LINK consolidates, I expect this to move toward $29.” The chart shows that $29 marks a weekly resistance level. A pullback scenario is also possible if market sentiment weakens. “A retest of $20 could happen if there’s a slow bleed in altcoins,” the same trader added. However, due to the speed of the recent move, a sharp drop appears less likely unless broader conditions shift. Whale Accumulation on the Rise On-chain data shows a rise in large holder activity. Whale wallets have added over 1.1 million LINK in the last seven days—valued at around $27 million. Smart money addresses also increased holdings by over 12% during the same period. Source: Nansen This activity has been backed by renewed accumulation from the top 100 LINK wallets. These shifts suggest that large buyers are stepping in while the token gains momentum. Chainlink Expands Role in RWA Sector Development around real-world asset (RWA) tools is drawing attention. Chainlink has launched data feeds for U.S. equities and ETFs. One analyst posted , “Chainlink is delivering what institutions need for tokenized markets.” He added, “The LINK era is here. This is just the beginning.” The project is now ranked first in RWA development activity, according to Santiment. Chainlink’s price remains near short-term highs, with $29 in focus as the next possible resistance zone. Traders are watching price action closely as the broader altcoin market looks for direction.

This strategic pricing, designed to cater to a vast and diverse user base, marks a pivotal moment in making advanced AI tools accessible to millions across the nation. For anyone following the rapid advancements in AI, this development signals a clear intent from OpenAI to deepen its roots in key global markets, starting with India’s immense digital population. Unveiling ChatGPT GO : A Game-Changer for India’s Digital Landscape OpenAI’s latest offering, ChatGPT GO, is priced at an attractive ₹399 per month (approximately $4.60), making it significantly more affordable than the existing ChatGPT Plus Plan, which costs ₹1,999 (about $23) monthly. This new tier is not just about a lower price point; it’s about enhancing accessibility and utility for everyday users. OpenAI has also enabled local currency pricing across all its plans and, critically, integrated UPI (Unified Payment Interface) support, a widely adopted payment framework in India, ensuring seamless transactions for a vast user base. So, what exactly does ChatGPT GO offer? Nick Turley, VP at OpenAI and head of ChatGPT, highlighted several key benefits that dramatically improve upon the free tier: 10x higher message limits: Engage with ChatGPT more frequently without hitting usage caps. 10x more image generations: Unleash your creativity with significantly more AI-generated images. 10x more file uploads: Process and analyze more documents and data directly within ChatGPT. 2x longer memory retention: Enjoy more personalized and contextually aware responses over extended conversations. As Turley shared on social media, “We just launched ChatGPT Go in India, a new subscription tier that gives users in India more access to our most popular features: 10x higher message limits, 10x more image generations, 10x more file uploads, and 2x longer memory compared with our free tier. All for Rs. 399. ” This move directly addresses a key user request for more affordable access, and India has been chosen as the initial rollout market to gather crucial feedback before a potential global expansion. Why OpenAI Chose India First: A Strategic Move OpenAI’s decision to launch ChatGPT GO first in India is a testament to the country’s rapidly expanding digital footprint and its immense potential as an AI market. India boasts an internet user base exceeding 850 million, making it one of the largest and fastest-growing digital economies globally. This vast pool of users presents a unique opportunity for AI companies to scale their services. The data underscores India’s importance: according to app analytics firm AppFigures, India has emerged as the leading country for ChatGPT app downloads across platforms, accounting for over 29 million downloads in the last 90 days alone. Despite this impressive adoption rate, the app generated only $3.6 million in revenue from Indian users during the same period. This discrepancy highlights a clear demand for AI tools coupled with a need for pricing structures that align with local economic realities. OpenAI’s move directly targets this gap, aiming to convert a significant portion of its free user base into paying subscribers by offering an accessible and feature-rich plan. The company’s global user base has also seen remarkable growth, with ChatGPT now serving over 700 million weekly users worldwide, up from 500 million just a few months prior. The Rise of AI in India : A Competitive Arena OpenAI’s strategic pricing in India is not happening in a vacuum; the country’s AI landscape is becoming increasingly competitive. Other major AI players have also recognized the immense potential of the Indian market and have made their own moves to attract and retain users. For instance, last month, Perplexity AI partnered with network provider Airtel to offer free Perplexity Pro subscriptions to its users, providing advanced search and summarization capabilities. Similarly, Google has extended a free AI Pro plan for one year to India-based students, aiming to foster AI literacy and adoption among the next generation. While OpenAI’s ChatGPT GO isn’t a free offering, its highly localized and affordable pricing strategy is designed to achieve a similar outcome: driving significant subscription conversion rates by making premium AI features accessible to a broader demographic. This competitive environment ultimately benefits Indian consumers, who now have a growing array of powerful and affordable AI tools at their fingertips, accelerating the adoption and integration of AI in India across various sectors. Embracing Affordable AI : What This Means for Users The introduction of affordable AI solutions like ChatGPT GO holds transformative potential for a diverse range of users in India. For students, it means access to a powerful learning companion that can assist with research, writing, and problem-solving. For small businesses and startups, it provides a cost-effective tool for content creation, customer support, and data analysis, leveling the playing field against larger enterprises. Content creators, developers, and researchers can leverage the enhanced message limits, image generation, and memory retention to boost their productivity and innovation. This localized pricing strategy is more than just a marketing tactic; it reflects a deeper understanding of the market’s needs and purchasing power. By removing financial barriers, OpenAI is empowering millions to explore the capabilities of advanced generative AI, fostering digital literacy, and potentially sparking a wave of innovation. The ability to pay via UPI further simplifies the process, making it incredibly convenient for the average Indian user to subscribe and utilize these cutting-edge tools. The focus on better memory retention also ensures more personalized and relevant interactions, making the AI feel more like a true assistant rather than just a chatbot. Conclusion: A New Era for AI Accessibility in India OpenAI’s launch of ChatGPT GO in India marks a pivotal moment in the global push for AI accessibility. By offering an affordable, feature-rich subscription plan tailored to the Indian market, OpenAI is not only strengthening its presence but also setting a precedent for how advanced AI can be democratized in emerging economies. This move is poised to significantly boost subscription rates, accelerate AI adoption, and empower millions of new users to leverage the transformative power of artificial intelligence. As India continues to solidify its position as a global digital powerhouse, initiatives like ChatGPT GO will be crucial in shaping a future where AI is not just a luxury, but an accessible tool for everyone.

The venture capitalist, often dubbed the “SPAC King,” filed late on Monday for an initial public offering of American Exceptionalism Acquisition Corp. A. The company will seek to merge with a business operating in what he describes as his “historical areas of business expertise.” In the filing, Palihapitiya identified sectors such as artificial intelligence, decentralized finance ( DeFi ), defense robotics and energy innovations like nuclear and solar power. He wrote that these industries could be vital in “maintaining US global leadership for the next century.” NASDAQ-LISTED $ETH TREASURY FIRM BTCS $BTCS TO PAY ETH DIVIDEND AND LOYALTY BONUS TO DETER SHORT SELLERS — The Wolf Of All Streets (@scottmelker) August 19, 2025 Palihapitiya Sees DeFi Enter Next Phase The document adds that innovation in these areas depends on sustained private funding and a willingness from technology firms to list publicly, expanding access to investors. Palihapitiya has long been vocal about digital assets. He singled out DeFi, saying the next phase will involve tighter links between traditional markets and blockchain -based systems. He cited Circle’s listing and the broader adoption of stablecoins as evidence of momentum. Two-Year Window to Secure Merger Partner The SPAC has 24 months to find a merger candidate. If it succeeds, it would mark Palihapitiya’s first new deal since he shuttered two large vehicles in 2022 after failing to identify suitable partners. At the height of the SPAC frenzy, he raised 10 blank-check firms, though not all delivered. Four never completed mergers, while others, including the high-profile listings of Virgin Galactic and Clover Health, came under intense scrutiny. ‘No Crying in the Casino,’ Filing Warns His latest effort arrives as the market shows signs of life, with more than $16b raised across 81 SPACs so far this year, according to SPAC Research. The new structure marks a shift from earlier SPAC models. Importantly, the offering will not include warrants, which were once a common feature for early buyers. Instead, founder shares will still be granted. However, they will only vest if the stock rises at least 50% above the $10 IPO price. Palihapitiya said this design aims to better align with shareholder interests. The sponsor, AEXA Sponsor LLC, has committed $1.75m in a private placement.

The filing has drawn attention as it officially kick-starts a formal review, positioning SEI at par with Solana and Ethereum in the staked exchange-traded funds race. According to the Sei team: This CBOE filing initiates the SEC’s formal review process of the Staked SEI ETF, joining ETH and SOL as one of the few staked ETF digital assets at this stage.

($/acc) 12:45 AM · Aug 19, 2025 401 Reply Copy link Read 32 replies The move underscores growing institutional momentum around Sei, especially with the increasing interest in regulated investment products linked to blockchain. Moreover, the development reflects the soaring appetite for altcoin ETFs as fintech firms seek diversity. Companies are exploring alternative crypto exchange-traded funds beyond the leading Bitcoin and Ethereum. Meanwhile, the SEC has been slow to authorize these financial instruments. It recently delayed a decision on three Solana ETF proposals . Nevertheless, Bitcoin’s spot ETF approval in January 2024 and Ethereum’s in 2025 opened the gates for broader adoption of crypto funds. SEI’s rise into the spotlight The L1 network has gained traction in recent months, with its stable performance drawing institutional players. The Sei mainnet went live two years ago, promising high-performance infrastructure for digital currency markets. It has handled over 3.4 billion transactions, 162 million blocks, and 115 million unique wallets. Sei has carved a niche that prioritizes speed and scalability in the blockchain industry. A staked SEI exchange-traded fund would bolster investor exposure and validate the project’s appeal and long-term potential. That will enrich institutional adoption as traditional companies explore regulated ways to join the cryptocurrency bandwagon. For the Sei community, the CBOE’s filing is crucial as it positions the altcoin among the few considered assets for staking ETFs. With the review process underway, SEI has joined the league of Solana and Ethereum in the altcoin exchange-traded funds race. Such developments magnify confidence in a project’s future potential. By supporting staked Sei ETFs, CBOE wants to offer mainstream investors an opportunity to gain exposure to SEI without additional tasks like interacting with staking protocols, exchanges, and wallets. If approved, the SEI ETF could enrich demand for the altcoin by making it accessible to a massive investor base. SEI price outlook The alt hovers at $0.3218, reflecting the broad market weakness with a 1.8% slide in the past 24 hours. SEI gained over 5% in the previous week, but prevailing sentiments suggest further corrections before bounce-backs. Chart by Coinamrketcap The 16% decline in trading volume suggests dwindling interest in the token. Also, the RSI and MACD indicate weakening momentum. Nonetheless, enthusiasts predict imminent uptrends. For instance, Sei Intern highlighted $0.32 as a crucial level for the digital coin.

By harnessing the power of artificial intelligence and data analytics, LgMining ensures that its users receive maximum profitability while minimizing energy waste and operational costs. Harnessing the Power of Renewable Energy The environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining has been a growing concern for many in the industry. Traditional mining operations often rely on non-renewable energy sources, leading to a significant carbon footprint. LgMining, however, is taking bold steps to minimize its environmental impact by utilizing renewable energy sources, specifically solar and wind power, to fuel its mining operations. By incorporating solar and wind energy into its mining facilities, LgMining not only reduces its reliance on traditional power grids but also takes a major step toward creating a greener and more sustainable mining process. Solar energy, with its scalability and reliability, is an ideal choice for mining operations. LgMining’s mining facilities are equipped with advanced solar panels that harness the power of the sun to run the mining rigs, reducing both energy consumption and overall operational costs. Moreover, LgMining also incorporates wind power as a complementary energy source. Wind energy provides a constant and renewable power supply, ensuring the mining facilities continue to operate smoothly even when sunlight is limited. By using a combination of these renewable sources, LgMining is able to provide a consistent and cost-effective energy solution for its mining farms, all while reducing the platform’s overall carbon footprint. Not only does the use of renewable energy contribute to environmental sustainability, but it also offers users the advantage of lower operating costs. Traditional mining operations, which rely heavily on non-renewable power sources, are often subject to fluctuating energy prices. In contrast, the stability of renewable energy offers LgMining a competitive edge in terms of cost efficiency, which directly benefits users through reduced fees and higher profit margins.

The company plans to list its Class A shares on the Nasdaq under the ticker FIGR, with Goldman Sachs, Jefferies, and BofA Securities serving as lead underwriters. Figure's path to public markets has been years in the making. In 2021, it launched a special purpose acquisition company , Figure Acquisition Corp. I, with a $250 million raise aimed at acquiring growth-stage businesses using Provenance as an efficiency layer, however in the end this SPAC did not bring Figure to market. A friendlier regulatory stance under the Trump administration and buoyant crypto and stock markets have set the stage for a surge of digital asset firms tapping the equity markets, including crypto exchange Bullish which is the owner of CoinDesk. The company last month merged with Figure Markets, a blockchain marketplace also launched by Cagney that issues YDLS , a yield-bearing stablecoin structured as a tokenized money market fund. Financials disclosed in the S-1 show revenue up 22.4% in the first half of 2025 to $190.6 million, with net income of $29 million compared with a $13 million loss a year earlier.

According to analysts, Cardano (ADA) , NEAR Protocol , and MAGACOIN FINANCE are among the top altcoins to watch —each offering a unique mix of strong fundamentals, ecosystem growth, and early-stage value. If you’re looking for the best altcoins to buy before the next bull run, these five hidden gems—especially MAGACOIN FINANCE—could deliver up to 50x returns as momentum builds. Cardano (ADA): ETF Catalyst and Ecosystem Upgrades Signal Breakout Potential Cardano is positioning itself as one of the top altcoins to watch , especially with the SEC’s pending decision on Grayscale’s Cardano spot ETF expected by late August 2025. Approval odds are currently estimated at 75%, and a positive verdict could spark a surge in institutional inflows—similar to Ethereum’s recent ETF boom. Why Cardano Is One of the Best Altcoins to Buy: Massive $71 million upgrade fund approved by governance for Hydra scaling and Project Acropolis. Over 17,000 Plutus smart contracts and DeFi volume hitting new highs. 66% of ADA supply staked , indicating deep holder conviction and strong decentralization. Key resistance at $1.25 could confirm a bull breakout, with upside targets at $2.10+. Despite short-term volatility, Cardano’s fundamentals remain rock-solid, making it one of the best altcoins to buy for mid- to long-term investors. NEAR Protocol: Post-Upgrade Ecosystem Growth Points to Major Upside NEAR Protocol just completed a significant network upgrade and hard fork on August 18, 2025—successfully implemented by Binance. While short-term price action was affected by institutional sell-offs, analysts remain optimistic thanks to growing ecosystem activity and community engagement. Why NEAR Is a Top Altcoin to Watch: Active wallets up 60% in the last 30 days, showing rising adoption. New $10 million developer grant fueling DeFi, cross-chain, and NFT growth. Strategic partnerships, including Subzero Labs’ $20M Rialo network , boost infrastructure depth. RSI nearing oversold territory, hinting at possible bounce from current levels around $2.57–$2.69 . NEAR is considered by analysts as one of the best altcoins to buy for exposure to a scalable, developer-friendly Layer 1 with strong governance. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The 50x Presale Power Play Everyone’s Talking About If there’s one project drawing comparisons to early SHIBA INU and PEPE, it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE . Currently in presale , this emerging meme-meets-utility coin is being described as a “hidden gem” with 50x potential by crypto analysts watching early-stage inflows and virality. The project is labelled by analysts as one of the top altcoins to watch for 2025 and beyond. The countdown is officially live, and the MAGACOIN FINANCE presale is almost sold out, with only a small number of tokens left. Investors are moving fast to secure their positions before the next pump phase begins. This could be the final opportunity to grab MAGACOIN at presale prices before listings and major momentum hit. XRP: Regulatory Clarity Brings Renewed Confidence Ripple’s ongoing legal saga is finally nearing resolution. On August 7, Ripple and the SEC filed to withdraw all remaining appeals, clearing the way for ETF speculation and institutional accumulation. Key XRP Insights: Trading in a tight range around $2.94–$3.12 , with key resistance at $3.50 . Analysts forecast $5.50 by the end of 2025 and $8–$12+ in future bull scenarios. Positive ETF decisions and Court of Appeals approval could be massive catalysts. While XRP may not deliver 50x returns, its blue-chip status and regulatory clarity make it a top altcoin to watch for solid, scalable growth. Dogecoin (DOGE): Whale Activity and ETF Rumors Fuel Comeback Hopes Dogecoin is showing signs of life despite recent declines. Trading at $0.2236 , it has fallen below short-term EMAs but remains supported by significant whale accumulation and ETF filing activity . Bullish Drivers for DOGE: Whales added ~$150 million in DOGE during August. ETF applications by Grayscale, Bitwise, and 21Shares pending approval. Potential rally to $0.36 if volume returns and $0.25 resistance is breached. Dogecoin remains a top altcoin to watch for traders betting on meme coin ETF approval and community-driven rallies. Final Thoughts As the market sets up for its next bull cycle, early positioning in the best altcoins to buy can make all the difference. While Ethereum and Bitcoin remain solid picks, hidden gems like MAGACOIN FINANCE, NEAR, and Cardano offer far greater upside for those who act early. If you’re serious about uncovering top altcoins to watch , start with the projects still under the radar— because that’s where 50x returns are born .

The firm updated its Ether holdings figures to 1.52 million ETH worth around $6.6 billion. Even with the asset’s retreat, that huge stash is worth more than the $5.88 billion in Bitcoin that MARA holds. The firm stated that it now holds 373,110 more ETH than a week ago, and its stash is $1.7 billion higher than a week ago. 1/6 BitMine today announced ETH holdings of 1,523,373 tokens: – ETH holdings of 1,523,373 is valued at $6.6 billion ($4,323 ETH) – 373,110 more ETH than a week ago – $1.7 billion higher than a week ago link : https://t.co/xUgJ1TadQ6 — Bitmine BMNR (@BitMNR) August 18, 2025 Super-aggressive Accumulation “In just a week, BitMine increased its ETH holdings by $1.7 billion to $6.6 billion, as institutional investors have expressed interest and support for our pursuit of the ‘alchemy of 5%’ of ETH,” said Fundstrat’s Tom Lee, who is also the Chairman of BitMine. “As we continue to say, we are leading crypto treasury peers by both the velocity of raising crypto NAV per share and by the high trading liquidity of our stock.” Lee echoed comments he made last week, stating that Ethereum is one of the biggest macro trades over the next 10-15 years. “Wall Street and AI moving onto the blockchain should lead to a greater transformation of today’s financial system,” he said before adding that “the majority of this is taking place on Ethereum.” Ether is emerging as a direct way to gain exposure to the “expected meteoric growth” in stablecoins as the Ethereum network hosts most of these assets, JP Morgan analysts wrote in a note last week. Ethereum currently has more than 55% market share of total tokenized real-world assets on-chain value, including stablecoins, according to RWA.xyz. BitMine has 37% market dominance in the Ethereum treasury sector, which is currently worth $17.6 billion with more than 4 million ETH accumulated by corporations, according to SER. The firm has targeted a $20 billion Ether treasury. Meanwhile, BTCS Inc. became the first public company to issue a dividend in ETH this week. ETH Price Retreats ETH prices have continued to retreat, however, as the crypto market correction deepens and the chances of it hitting an all-time high this month dwindle. Ether recovered from Monday’s low of $4,250 but failed to move higher than $4,380, retreating back below $4,300 again during the Tuesday morning Asian trading session. The asset has now corrected 10% from its 2025 high and is currently trading around support levels. A breakdown from here could result in a fast fall below $4,000, however.

The firm will actively issue MSTR shares when the market NAV multiple (mNAV) is above 4.0x. When mNAV sits between 2.5x and 4.0x, it will issue shares to buy more BTC. If mNAV falls below 2.5x, the company says it will prioritize paying interest on debt and funding preferred equity dividends. There is also a note that the company may consider using credit to repurchase MSTR shares when mNAV is below 1.0x. That guidance matters because issuing shares affects equity holders. Reports present this as a tool the company intends to use depending on market conditions. Market Moves And Stock Reaction Bitcoin pulled back in the last week and the company’s stock fell alongside it. Bitcoin is down almost 5% in the past seven days and slid below the psychological $115,000 mark at one point. MSTR stock dropped more than 8% over the last five days, slipping from a prior close of $365 to roughly $357 in recent trading.

X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) shared the news on X, revealing that both 21Shares and CoinShares now face extended waiting periods as regulators conduct additional analysis of their proposed cryptocurrency ETFs. More XRP ETF Delays CoinShares submitted its XRP ETF application targeting a Nasdaq listing in early February, with the SEC now scheduling its final determination for October 23. The London-based asset manager initially filed its rule change proposal on February 7, followed by official publication three weeks later. 21Shares faces a slightly earlier deadline of October 19 for its Core XRP Trust, which would trade on Cboe BZX Exchange if approved. The SEC acknowledged the 21Shares ETF application in February, but delayed its decision on this proposal in May. This decision to further delay this decision was not received well by many community members. However, X Finance Bull has a different perspective. Speculation on the Reason for the Delay X Finance Bull suggests that the extensions represent calculated timing rather than genuine regulatory roadblocks. According to him, the SEC can’t stop XRP ETF approval, but it’s buying time with this delay. He believes the SEC is using this tactic to cause XRP’s price to drop, so its members can buy the dip before the approval drives the digital asset’s price significantly higher. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 In June, Bloomberg raised the probability of an XRP ETF approval to 95% , and XRP supporters echoed X Finance Bull’s sentiment, viewing the extensions as confirmation that approval remains inevitable. Many interpret the delays as creating prime accumulation opportunities before the anticipated price surge. Bullish Expectations for XRP X Finance Bull boldly set a $1000 target for XRP, reflecting extreme bullish sentiment following the delay. XRP is trading at 3.06, down 1.33% from yesterday. He also announced plans to purchase additional tokens during the dip. X Finance Bull is treating the regulatory extensions as a buying signal rather than a setback, and many community members share this belief, planning to accumulate tokens as well. While the delay may cause a temporary dip, other experts have shared bullish targets for XRP once the ETFs go live , and this might be the last opportunity to accumulate tokens at the current low prices.

The second-largest digital asset by market capitalization briefly touched $4,776 last week, just shy of the $4,878 record set in 2021, before retreating. At the time of writing, ETH trades at $4,280, reflecting a 5.7% decline in the past 24 hours and nearly $500 below its recent peak. The pullback comes as analysts closely watch trading activity in derivatives markets. According to data shared by CryptoQuant analyst CryptoOnchain, retail participation in Ethereum’s futures market has surged significantly in recent sessions. This heightened activity, combined with elevated open interest levels, has sparked debate about whether the market is approaching a tipping point. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Pulls Back Again, Will Buyers Step In at Critical Levels? Ethereum Futures Market Shows Overheating Signals CryptoOnchain noted that Ethereum’s futures trading frequency has entered what he describes as the “Many Retail” and “Too Many Retail” zones, thresholds that historically appear near the late stages of strong uptrends. “Retail participation has sharply increased as ETH prices moved above $4,500,” he explained, adding that such conditions often bring greater volatility and sudden pullbacks. Additional indicators support this cautious outlook. The analyst highlighted Ethereum’s Futures Volume Bubble Map, which currently shows clusters of large red bubbles near recent price highs. These patterns, he said, have frequently preceded either sharp breakouts or rapid corrections when excessive leverage unwinds. Meanwhile, open interest (OI) on Binance futures climbed to nearly $12 billion before easing back to around $10.3 billion. While still at historically high levels, the recent dip suggests some traders may already be reducing exposure. “Extreme open interest expansion near price peaks can either provide fuel for further upside or trigger squeezes when the market turns,” CryptoOnchain wrote. He also pointed out that Binance’s taker buy/sell ratio has remained below 1, indicating selling pressure has dominated trading activity in recent days. Spot Market Dynamics Offer a Different Perspective Not all analysts see the current pullback as an immediate sign of market stress. In a separate post, CryptoQuant contributor Woominkyu observed that funding rates for ETH perpetual futures remain flat around zero. This contrasts with previous bull runs in 2020–2021 and early 2024, when funding rates spiked above 0.05–0.10, signaling overheated long positions. “ETH just pushed above $4.2K, but funding is still sitting flat,” Woominkyu explained. “That suggests the rally has been driven more by spot buying rather than leverage.” Related Reading: Ethereum Demand Grows As ETFs Break Records With $2.85B Weekly Inflow According to the analyst, this dynamic indicates a relatively healthier market environment compared to past rallies, as it reduces the risk of forced liquidations. He added that a funding rate surge above 0.05 would be the level to watch for potential short-term tops.

The company announced on August 8 that it acquired an additional 1,565 Solana (SOL) tokens. This strategic acquisition brings its total Solana holdings to an impressive 14,194 SOL, valued at approximately $2.7 million at the time of the announcement, according to a report from SolanaFloor on X. This move solidifies SOL Treasury Corp’s position as the first publicly traded entity in Europe to hold Solana (SOL) as a primary treasury asset, marking a notable milestone in corporate crypto adoption. Why is SOL Treasury Making This Strategic Investment? Acheter-Louer.fr (ALALO) is a well-established player in the digital real estate advertising sector, providing a robust platform for property listings. Its subsidiary, SOL Treasury Corp, was specifically created to manage and diversify the group’s treasury assets, venturing into the burgeoning digital asset space. The decision to allocate a substantial portion of its treasury to Solana is a calculated one, reflecting a forward-thinking approach to corporate finance. Diversification: Companies often seek to diversify their treasury holdings beyond traditional fiat currencies and bonds to mitigate risks and explore new avenues for growth. Inflation Hedge: In an environment of economic uncertainty, some businesses view cryptocurrencies as a potential hedge against inflation, preserving purchasing power over time. Growth Potential: Solana, with its high-speed and low-cost blockchain, represents a promising technology with significant growth potential, offering a compelling investment opportunity for forward-looking entities like SOL Treasury . Understanding Corporate Treasury Crypto Holdings Holding cryptocurrencies as treasury assets is a relatively new but growing trend among public companies. Pioneered by firms like MicroStrategy, which famously adopted Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset, this strategy involves converting a portion of a company’s cash reserves into digital currencies. For SOL Treasury , choosing Solana specifically highlights a belief in the network’s long-term viability and its distinct advantages within the blockchain ecosystem. What makes Solana particularly appealing for a corporate treasury? Speed and Efficiency: Solana boasts incredibly fast transaction speeds and low fees, making it an attractive platform for various decentralized applications and potentially for future corporate uses. Scalability: Its architecture is designed for high throughput, addressing concerns about network congestion that can plague other blockchains. Growing Ecosystem: Solana has a rapidly expanding ecosystem of DeFi projects, NFTs, and dApps, indicating strong developer and user adoption. These attributes suggest that SOL Treasury Corp views Solana not just as a speculative asset, but as a foundational technology with practical applications and significant future value. What Are the Potential Benefits and Risks for SOL Treasury ? The acquisition of Solana tokens by SOL Treasury Corp brings a mix of potential benefits and inherent risks. On the upside, being an early mover in holding SOL as a primary treasury asset can provide significant visibility and a competitive edge. If Solana’s value appreciates, it could substantially boost the company’s balance sheet, creating additional value for shareholders. However, the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies presents clear challenges: Price Volatility: The value of SOL can fluctuate dramatically, potentially leading to significant paper losses if the market turns unfavorable. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally, which could impact the legal and operational aspects of holding digital assets. Security Concerns: Storing digital assets securely requires robust cybersecurity measures to prevent hacks and theft. Despite these risks, the continued investment by SOL Treasury suggests a calculated approach, likely involving risk management strategies and a strong conviction in Solana’s long-term prospects. Implications for Corporate Crypto Adoption The move by SOL Treasury Corp is more than just an isolated investment; it signals a broader trend in corporate finance. As more publicly traded companies explore and embrace digital assets for their treasuries, it lends further legitimacy and institutional validation to the crypto market. This could encourage other European and global firms to consider similar strategies, driving mainstream adoption of blockchain technologies and digital currencies. The commitment of SOL Treasury to Solana, specifically, also highlights the increasing diversity of cryptocurrencies being considered by institutional players beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. This diversification speaks to the maturing crypto market and the growing recognition of various blockchain ecosystems’ unique strengths. It sets a precedent, potentially paving the way for more companies to explore alternative digital assets as part of their financial strategies. In conclusion, SOL Treasury Corp’s latest acquisition of 1,565 SOL tokens is a landmark event. It not only significantly increases their Solana holdings but also reinforces their pioneering status as the first European publicly traded company to embrace SOL as a core treasury asset. This bold decision underscores a growing confidence in digital currencies among traditional financial entities and points towards a future where cryptocurrencies play an increasingly vital role in corporate balance sheets. This strategic move by SOL Treasury may well inspire other companies to follow suit, further integrating the exciting world of blockchain into mainstream finance.

The Asia FX Outlook , in particular, offers a fascinating barometer of market sentiment, often reflecting the subtle shifts driven by international diplomacy and central bank actions. As markets remain steady, the collective gaze turns towards two pivotal events: potential Russia-Ukraine talks and the highly anticipated Federal Reserve symposium. How will these seemingly disparate forces shape the future of currency markets and, by extension, the broader financial landscape? Let’s delve into the currents guiding Asia’s currencies. Asia FX Outlook: A Glimpse into Regional Stability Despite the backdrop of global uncertainties, the Asia FX Outlook has largely presented a picture of remarkable stability. This steadiness isn’t merely coincidental; it’s a testament to several underlying factors that bolster the region’s currencies against external shocks. Many Asian economies have demonstrated robust trade surpluses, healthy foreign exchange reserves, and prudent fiscal management, creating a buffer against volatility. Consider the performance of key Asian currencies: Japanese Yen (JPY): Often viewed as a safe-haven asset, the JPY’s performance is closely watched, particularly in times of global stress. Its movements are often influenced by interest rate differentials and risk sentiment. Chinese Yuan (CNY): As the currency of the world’s second-largest economy, the CNY’s stability is crucial. Managed by the People’s Bank of China, its movements reflect China’s economic health and trade relations. Korean Won (KRW): Highly sensitive to global trade and technology cycles, the KRW’s trajectory offers insights into the health of the tech sector and broader manufacturing. Singapore Dollar (SGD): Known for its strong fundamentals and a monetary policy managed by exchange rate rather than interest rates, the SGD typically exhibits resilience. This collective resilience underscores the growing maturity and diversification of Asian economies, which are increasingly less dependent on single external drivers and more reliant on strong domestic demand and intra-regional trade. However, this stability is not immune to significant external pressures, particularly those emanating from geopolitical hotspots and major central bank policy shifts. Geopolitical Impact: The Shadow of Russia-Ukraine Talks on Global Currencies The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine continues to cast a long shadow over global financial markets, and currency valuations are no exception. The mere prospect of renewed Geopolitical Impact , especially in the form of potential peace talks, can trigger significant shifts in investor sentiment and, consequently, currency flows. When tensions escalate, investors typically flock to traditional safe-haven currencies like the US Dollar (USD), Japanese Yen (JPY), and Swiss Franc (CHF), causing other currencies, including some in Asia, to depreciate. Conversely, any credible sign of de-escalation or a diplomatic resolution tends to encourage a “risk-on” environment, leading to a reversal of these flows. The implications for Asia FX are multifaceted: Commodity Prices: Russia is a major exporter of oil, gas, and other raw materials. Conflict-driven supply disruptions or fears thereof have historically led to spikes in commodity prices. For net commodity importers in Asia (like Japan, Korea, and India), this translates to higher import bills and inflationary pressures, potentially weakening their currencies. A resolution could stabilize or lower these prices, offering relief. Supply Chains: Global supply chains, already fragile post-pandemic, have been further strained by the conflict. Any improvement in the geopolitical landscape could ease these pressures, benefiting export-oriented Asian economies. Investor Confidence: Reduced geopolitical uncertainty can boost overall investor confidence, encouraging capital flows back into emerging markets, including those in Asia, strengthening their currencies. Market participants are therefore keenly observing any diplomatic overtures, understanding that the outcome of these talks could dictate short-term volatility and long-term directional trends for a range of currencies. Federal Reserve Policy: Decoding the Jackson Hole Symposium’s Influence Another monumental event on the financial calendar is the Federal Reserve’s annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. This gathering of central bankers, economists, and financial market participants often serves as a crucial platform for policymakers to signal future monetary policy direction. The anticipation surrounding Federal Reserve Policy announcements at such events is palpable, as the Fed’s decisions reverberate across global financial markets, directly influencing interest rates, bond yields, and, crucially, currency valuations. What makes the Fed’s stance so impactful on Asia FX? Interest Rate Differentials: When the Fed raises interest rates, the yield on US dollar-denominated assets becomes more attractive relative to those in other countries. This incentivizes capital to flow into the US, strengthening the dollar. Conversely, a dovish Fed stance can weaken the dollar, making Asian assets relatively more appealing. Global Liquidity: The Fed’s quantitative easing (QE) or quantitative tightening (QT) policies directly impact global dollar liquidity. A tightening of liquidity can create funding pressures globally, often leading to a stronger dollar and weaker emerging market currencies. Risk Sentiment: The Fed’s outlook on inflation and economic growth shapes global risk sentiment. A confident Fed can boost risk appetite, potentially benefiting higher-yielding Asian currencies, while a cautious stance might lead to a flight to safety. The “dollar smile” theory often comes into play here: the dollar tends to strengthen when the US economy is performing exceptionally well (leading to rate hikes) or exceptionally poorly (triggering safe-haven demand). Asian currencies often find themselves on the other side of this smile, weakening during periods of extreme dollar strength. Therefore, every nuance of the Fed’s communication is dissected for clues about future rate paths and balance sheet adjustments, which will undeniably ripple through the Currency Market Trends across Asia. Currency Market Trends: Navigating Volatility and Opportunity in Asia The global Currency Market Trends are a complex tapestry woven from a multitude of threads, including inflation differentials, interest rate expectations, trade balances, capital flows, and geopolitical events. For Asia, these trends present both significant challenges and compelling opportunities. While the overall outlook for Asia FX has been one of relative stability, specific currencies can experience considerable volatility based on localized factors and global shifts. Key trends influencing Asia FX include: Inflationary Pressures: Global inflation, driven by supply chain disruptions and energy costs, impacts purchasing power and central bank responses. Asian central banks are balancing growth with price stability, and their differing approaches create divergence in currency performance. Trade Dynamics: Asia remains a global manufacturing and export powerhouse. Strong export performance generally supports local currencies, while trade disputes or a slowdown in global demand can exert downward pressure. Capital Flows: Investor appetite for Asian assets, influenced by interest rate differentials and economic growth prospects, dictates capital inflows and outflows, directly affecting currency strength. Divergent Monetary Policies: While the Fed’s policy is a major driver, Asian central banks pursue their own independent monetary policies based on domestic conditions. This divergence can create attractive carry trade opportunities for investors. For investors, understanding these trends is crucial. Diversification across a basket of Asian currencies can mitigate risk, while selective exposure to currencies with strong economic fundamentals and supportive central bank policies can yield positive returns. The challenge lies in accurately predicting the interplay of these global and regional factors. Economic Stability: Asia’s Pivotal Role in the Global Puzzle Ultimately, the steadiness of Asia’s currencies is deeply intertwined with the region’s broader Economic Stability . Asia, encompassing diverse economies from the tech-driven powerhouses of Northeast Asia to the burgeoning markets of Southeast Asia and the subcontinent, represents a significant engine of global growth. Its resilience against recent global shocks, including the pandemic and inflationary pressures, highlights its growing importance in the global economic architecture. How does Asia contribute to and navigate global economic stability? Diversified Growth Drivers: Many Asian economies are moving beyond traditional manufacturing, investing heavily in technology, services, and domestic consumption, making them less susceptible to single-sector downturns. Regional Trade Integration: Initiatives like the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) foster stronger intra-regional trade, creating a buffer against external demand fluctuations. Demographic Dividends: Several Asian nations benefit from young, growing populations, promising future labor force expansion and consumer markets. Prudent Policymaking: Many Asian governments and central banks have demonstrated a commitment to fiscal discipline and inflation management, which builds investor confidence. However, challenges persist. Rising debt levels in some nations, the ongoing impact of climate change, and the need for continuous structural reforms remain critical areas of focus. The interplay between global events—like geopolitical tensions and the Fed’s monetary stance—and Asia’s inherent strengths will continue to define the region’s economic trajectory and, by extension, the performance of its currencies. As global markets evolve, Asia’s role as a pillar of stability and growth becomes ever more pronounced, making its currency movements a key indicator for the health of the broader financial world. Actionable Insights for Navigating Asia FX For those looking to engage with Asia FX, here are some actionable insights: Monitor Central Bank Communications: Pay close attention not only to the Federal Reserve but also to the monetary policy statements from the Bank of Japan, People’s Bank of China, Bank of Korea, and others. Their forward guidance on interest rates and inflation targets will be crucial. Track Geopolitical Developments: Keep abreast of headlines related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and other potential flashpoints. Escalations can lead to risk aversion, while de-escalation can boost sentiment. Analyze Commodity Price Trends: For commodity-importing Asian economies, sustained high energy or food prices can be a significant headwind for their currencies. Assess Trade Balances: Nations with persistent trade surpluses tend to have stronger currencies over the long term, reflecting healthy external demand for their goods and services. Consider Diversification: Given the diverse economic landscapes within Asia, a diversified approach across several Asian currencies can help mitigate risk and capture broader regional growth. Challenges and Opportunities Challenges: External Shocks: Asia remains vulnerable to global economic slowdowns, sudden shifts in capital flows, and unforeseen geopolitical events. Inflationary Pressures: While some inflation is manageable, runaway inflation could force aggressive monetary tightening, potentially dampening growth. China’s Economy: As a major trading partner and economic influencer, any significant slowdown or policy shift in China can have ripple effects across the region. US Dollar Strength: A persistently strong US dollar can make dollar-denominated debt more expensive for Asian borrowers and draw capital away from the region. Opportunities: Strong Fundamentals: Many Asian economies boast robust growth prospects, sound fiscal policies, and large domestic markets. Technological Advancement: Asia is at the forefront of technological innovation, driving productivity gains and new industries. Regional Integration: Increased economic integration within Asia can create a more resilient and self-sustaining economic bloc. Yield Differentials: For investors, the potential for attractive yield differentials compared to developed markets can make certain Asian currencies appealing for carry trades. Conclusion: Asia FX – A Barometer of Global Interconnectedness The seemingly steady performance of Asia FX Outlook is far from static; it is a dynamic reflection of a complex interplay between global geopolitical currents and the powerful forces of central bank policy. As markets continue to eye potential Russia-Ukraine talks and the Federal Reserve symposium, the resilience of Asian currencies will be tested, but also affirmed. These events underscore the profound interconnectedness of our global financial system, where a diplomatic breakthrough or a central bank’s nuanced statement can send ripples across continents, influencing everything from trade flows to investment decisions. For investors, businesses, and indeed anyone tracking the pulse of the global economy, the movements in Asia FX offer invaluable insights. They tell a story of regional strengths, external vulnerabilities, and the ongoing dance between risk and opportunity. Navigating this landscape requires vigilance, a deep understanding of macroeconomic fundamentals, and an appreciation for the subtle signals that shape the world’s currency markets. As Asia continues to solidify its position as a vital engine of global growth, its currencies will remain a crucial barometer for Economic Stability and global financial health.

Key Takeaways: FSC halts crypto lending as South Korean exchanges must suspend services until formal rules are introduced. Investor risks exposed with 27,600 users borrowing $1.1B and 13% forced into liquidation in one month. Guidelines coming soon as regulators promise a rulebook to protect users and stabilize the market. The Financial Services Commission (FSC) confirmed on Tuesday that it issued administrative guidance to exchanges, instructing them to halt operations that allow users to borrow against cryptocurrencies or fiat deposits. The order takes effect immediately and will remain in place until new lending rules are finalized. Rapid Growth, Rising Risks Crypto lending services had surged in popularity since early July. Upbit introduced a program enabling users to borrow up to 80% of the value of their deposits in Korean won or digital assets, using Tether (USDT), Bitcoin, and XRP as collateral. Rival Bithumb rolled out a similar product, offering loans worth up to four times the value of a customer’s holdings. Other local platforms quickly followed. The launches coincided with the ruling party’s proposal of the Digital Asset Basic Act, which seeks to formally authorize lending services within exchange operations. However, the FSC warned last month that the products operated in a regulatory gray zone and posed significant risks. In its latest release, the regulator disclosed that roughly 27,600 investors borrowed 1.5 trillion won ($1.1 billion) in the first month of one company’s lending program. About 13% of borrowers were forced into liquidation due to market volatility, the FSC said. It also highlighted an unusual sell-off in USDT triggered by the lending services, which temporarily disrupted stablecoin pricing on Korean platforms. South Korea confirms that the only “investment” the U.S. is getting out of them is in the form of high interest rate loans. Just like Japan. pic.twitter.com/REDeuP8DvC — Spencer Hakimian (@SpencerHakimian) August 4, 2025 The FSC stressed that it intends to create a clear rulebook for digital asset lending. “We will move swiftly to prepare guidelines to protect users and ensure stability in the market,” the agency said, adding that existing loans can still be repaid or extended under current contracts. Exchanges that fail to comply with the suspension order face on-site inspections. Both Upbit and Bithumb had already paused lending once in July, though Bithumb resumed operations under stricter terms before the new suspension. South Korea Eases Crypto Curbs, Paves Way for First Spot ETFs The crackdown comes amid South Korea’s broader pivot toward regulated crypto adoption. Authorities are lifting restrictions on institutional trading and preparing to approve the country’s first spot crypto ETFs . President Lee Jae Myung’s administration is also working on a stablecoin framework pegged to the Korean won, signaling a more open approach to digital finance despite the latest curbs. Last week, Dunamu, the operator of South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange Upbit, unveiled a new custody service aimed at corporate and institutional clients, as regulatory green lights for virtual asset investments spark growing demand for secure storage solutions. The service stores all deposited digital assets in cold wallets, entirely offline and insulated from internet-based threats, to shield holdings from cyberattacks and other external breaches.

The blockchain firm becomes the latest in a growing flurry of crypto-focused companies eyeing a public listing. Figure Reports 22% YoY Growth The New York-based company stated in a filing with the US SEC that its revenue soared 22% year-over-year to $191 million in the first half of 2025. Figure Tech also reported a net income of $29.1 million. The company incurred a net loss of $15.6 million on revenue of $12.5 million in the same period a year earlier. The initial public offering will list the company’s Class A common stock on the Nasdaq under the ticker ‘FIGR.’ Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Jefferies Financial Group Inc. and Bank of America Corp. are the lead underwriters. FIGR Lines Up for a Big Debut, IPO Momentum Builds Figure, which develops blockchain technology to facilitate loans, initially announced its IPO plans early this month.

Further, the 2024-2025 bull market has been particularly attractive due to a wave of industry IPOs. Crypto exchange operator Bullish made an impressive debut, pricing its IPO at $37 per share , valuing the exchange at $5.4 billion and raising $1.1 billion. Earlier, stablecoin issuer Circle and Bitcoin-friendly design platform Figma went public, with Circle planning to launch a national trust charter . “The IPO is one step in a long process to bring blockchain to all aspects of capital markets,” Cagney said in the Monday filing, adding that blockchains can do more than disrupt existing markets. “By taking historically illiquid assets – such as loans – and putting these assets and their performance history on-chain, blockchain can bring liquidity to markets that have never had such,” he added.

A sharp selloff in the final trading hour saw the asset dip 1% on surging volume, suggesting institutional distribution and stop-loss liquidations driving price action. Technical Analysis Shows Mixed Signals XRP traded within a $0.11 range between $2.94 and $3.10 across the 24-hour session from August 18 05:00 to August 19 04:00, representing nearly 4% intraday volatility. A bullish breakout during the 17:00 trading hour on August 18 pushed prices from $2.97 to $3.10, supported by heavy volume of 131 million—double the 24-hour average of 66.8 million. This established short-term support near $3.00. Momentum faded quickly, however. The token rejected multiple times at $3.09, sliding into consolidation around $2.99. An aggressive pullback unfolded during the 03:00 hour on August 19, when XRP dropped from $3.04 to $2.99. Key Market Movements • XRP declined 1% in the final 60 minutes, sliding from $3.03 to $2.99 as volumes spiked to 5.26 million—five times the hourly average • Distribution pressure accelerated around the $3.00 psychological threshold, triggering stop-loss liquidations during the 03:43–03:46 interval • A bullish surge earlier in the session (August 18 17:00) lifted XRP from $2.97 to $3.10 on 131 million volume, far above average activity Market Dynamics Drive Sharp Reversal The late-session breakdown confirmed institutional selling near $3.00, erasing the earlier breakout’s momentum. While $2.99 provided intraday stabilization, the volume-backed rejection at $3.09 highlights growing resistance pressure. XRP now sits at a crossroads: holding above $2.99 could allow bulls to retest the $3.08–$3.09 cluster, while failure risks a deeper correction toward the $2.96 demand zone. Technical Indicators Summary • Range: $0.11 (3.8%) between $3.10 peak and $2.94 trough • Resistance: $3.09, rejected repeatedly through evening sessions • Support: $3.00 psychological level, tested under high-volume distribution • Risk: Breakdown toward $2.96 demand zone if $2.99 fails • Signal: Bullish triangle structure intact, but momentum fading under profit-taking",Markets|XRP|AI Market Insights|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-19 05:25:22

The delays come as demand for crypto ETFs surges, with Ethereum funds breaking records and BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust keeping up its market dominance. SEC Postpones ETF Rulings The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) once again pushed back decisions on several high-profile cryptocurrency exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposals, extending their review deadlines into October. In filings that were made on August 18, the agency set Oct. 8 as the new date to rule on NYSE Arca’s Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF, Oct. 16 for Solana ETF applications from 21Shares and Bitwise, and Oct. 19 for the 21Shares Core XRP Trust. The Truth Social ETF was submitted in June, and is structured as a commodity-based trust holding Bitcoin and Ethereum directly, despite being branded under former President Donald Trump’s social media platform. Meanwhile, 21Shares and Bitwise are seeking approval for what would be the first US spot Solana ETFs. The SEC also extended its review of 21Shares’ Core XRP Trust, which is designed to hold XRP directly. These delays are consistent with the SEC’s pattern this year. Since March, the regulator postponed decisions on multiple altcoin-related ETFs, including products tied to XRP, Litecoin and Dogecoin. It also extended its review of Bitwise’s request to allow in-kind creations and redemptions for its spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, with that decision expected in September. Analysts noticed that the SEC almost always uses its full extension period to gather feedback before issuing a final ruling. Bloomberg’s James Seyffart said earlier this year that most filings will see final deadlines fall in October. The cluster of deadlines is set against a backdrop of booming ETF demand. Crypto-related exchange-traded products saw $3.75 billion in inflows this year alone, with Ethereum ETFs recently breaking records. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust still dominates the market by controlling more than $87 billion in assets under management, dwarfing rivals. Globally, over 100 crypto ETFs are now listed, and the industry is increasingly intersecting with mainstream financial markets.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|XRP|SOL|BTC,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-19 05:30:00

This week’s focus is the Fed’s August 21-23 Jackson Hole symposium, where Chair Jerome Powell is due to speak on the economic outlook and the central bank’s policy framework. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped by 0.2% on early Tuesday. Japan’s Nikkei shares hit a record high on Monday, rising 0.7% to 43,683.56. Market await policy hints from the Fed’s upcoming annual meeting All eyes turn to Jackson Hole this week as Fed Chair Jerome Powell is set to deliver what may be his most important — and possibly final — policy speech.

A 5% plunge in SoftBank Group also caused a drop in the stock index after the firm announced a $2 billion stake in struggling U.S. chipmaker Intel. The greenback continued moving higher amid traders’ policy hints of anticipation from the Fed ahead of its annual meeting in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Kyle Rodda, an analyst at Capital.com, acknowledged that markets are cautious for potential market volatility in the wake of the Fed’s Jackson Hole symposium. “A dovish shift is being priced in, with further strength in equity markets – and weakness in the U.S. dollar – reliant on the Fed meeting these expectations.” -Kyle Rodda, Senior Financial Market Analyst at Capital.com. According to CME FedWatch, there’s an 83.6% chance of the Fed cutting rates by 25 basis points at its September 17 meeting. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan, last week’s inflation data led to a rise in the probability of a potential September rate cut. The dollar didn’t move much, maintaining its price at 147.78 yen. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of currencies, gained by 0.2% in the previous session to 98.171. U.S. crude prices plummeted by 0.2% to $63.29 a barrel. Spot gold traded higher at $3,338.67 per ounce. The euro also traded steady at $1.1658 amid heightened geopolitical tensions in the region as traders evaluated promising diplomatic signals toward ending hostilities between Russia and Ukraine. European futures climbed higher, with German DAX futures rising by 0.2%, while the Pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 futures and the FTSE futures each added 0.3%. Trump meets with Zelenskyy in Washington European futures gained after U.S. President Donald Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, together with other EU leaders and NATO partners in Washington, D.C. Zelensky acknowledged that security guarantees for his country will likely be worked out within 10 days after the talks. He also called for the release of Ukrainian children forcibly taken by Russian forces, as well as the release of prisoners of war and other civilians. Trump revealed that he spoke with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen regarding the problem of the missing children. He said he hopes to return missing kids to their families. Von der Leyen also mentioned that every single Ukrainian child abducted by the Kremlin must be returned to their families. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Ukraine and Russia would need to make some concessions and that land would be part of the conversation. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said on Monday that the meeting was very successful. He expects security guarantees between Ukraine and Russia as part of a peace deal, adding that they are important to consider what’s next for Ukraine’s territory and also to prevent Putin from ever trying again to invade parts of Ukraine. The meeting came as Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin met in a summit in Alaska last week, but didn’t reach an agreement on ceasing hostilities in the Ukraine war. Trump also hinted at a trilateral summit afterwards among the three heads of state.

At the same time, a new viral memecoin —Layer Brett—is attracting attention in the crypto presale scene with its low $0.0044 entry price and ambitious $1 target for 2025. The excitement around this next-generation Ethereum Layer 2 project is growing fast, with bold claims that LBRETT could be the next 100x altcoin in the upcoming crypto bull run 2025. With the presale live and staking APYs rivaling anything else in the space, both seasoned and new investors are watching these altcoins closely. ADA’s outlook: What’s driving the Cardano price prediction? ADA is back in the spotlight as the latest Cardano Price Prediction indicates a potential rally to $1.50 by September. This optimism is fueled by recent smart contract upgrades, ecosystem expansion, and a surge in Cardano news coverage. Recent Cardano upgrades focus on boosting scalability and DeFi coin utility, which could push ADA even higher if momentum continues. However, some investors are seeking higher returns than Cardano’s traditional staking can offer. This shift is driving interest toward trending cryptocurrencies and the next big crypto, especially among those looking for the best crypto to buy now. LBRETT: The next 100x meme coin disrupting Layer 2 crypto While ADA delivers steady growth, Layer Brett is making noise as a low cap crypto gem that blends meme energy with real tech utility. Built on Ethereum Layer 2, LBRETT offers lightning-fast transactions and ultra-low gas fees—often under $0.01 compared to Ethereum’s $2.80+. This innovative DeFi coin is currently in Crypto Presale at just $0.0044 per token, positioning early buyers for explosive gains if price targets are met. Unlike most meme tokens, LBRETT fuses meme culture with real blockchain scaling, aiming to be the top gainer crypto and best crypto presale of 2025. Its roadmap and community-first approach target dominance in the Layer 2 blockchain arena, making it a top altcoins contender for both meme and utility-driven investors. Why investors are looking towards LBRETT after disappointing Cardano price predictions While the Cardano Price Prediction suggests moderate growth, many investors are pivoting to LBRETT for its outsized upside and meme-fueled momentum. ADA remains a reliable ERC-20 token and smart contracts leader, but its staking rewards and price projections pale compared to the high-yield, high-utility promises of Layer Brett. With LBRETT trending on Google and crypto Twitter, and no credible scam reports, FOMO is building as more look for the next 100x meme coin and best long-term crypto. As presale supplies dwindle, urgency is high for those wanting to secure low entry and stake for massive passive income. Conclusion The 2025 crypto bull run is shaping up as a battle between established altcoins like ADA and disruptive newcomers like Layer Brett. With the Cardano Price Prediction pointing to incremental growth and LBRETT offering viral meme power, low cap potential, and up to 7500% APY for early stakers, the choice is clear for risk-tolerant investors. Layer Brett is still in presale , but not for long—don’t miss out on what could be the most scalable meme token launch on Ethereum. Where meme meets mechanism, the next top meme coin may be just a click away.

50320861,https://cryptonews.com/?p=410629,1755582163,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/50320861.jpeg,Judge Backs Logan Paul’s Bid to Dismiss CryptoZoo Class-Action Lawsuit,https://cryptonews.com/news/judge-backs-logan-pauls-bid-to-dismiss-cryptozoo-lawsuit/,"A Texas magistrate judge has recommended dismissing most of a proposed class-action lawsuit against YouTuber Logan Paul over his collapsed NFT venture, CryptoZoo, in a ruling that could sharply weaken the case. Key Takeaways: A Texas magistrate judge recommended dismissing most claims in the CryptoZoo class-action lawsuit against Logan Paul. The judge permanently rejected the commodity pool fraud claim, calling plaintiffs’ arguments “dizzying.” Plaintiffs may amend 26 other claims, but failed to show evidence tying Paul personally to CryptoZoo’s collapse. Magistrate Judge Ronald Griffin advised an Austin federal court on Thursday that the plaintiffs, a group of CryptoZoo buyers, had failed to establish direct ties between Paul and their financial losses. The lawsuit, filed in February 2023, accused Paul and his co-defendants of orchestrating a “rug pull” by promising features and rewards that never materialized. Commodity Pool Fraud Claim Tossed In his 75-page report, Griffin concluded that one of the group’s 27 claims, alleging Paul engaged in commodity pool fraud, should be dismissed permanently. Plaintiffs had argued that CryptoZoo NFTs functioned like option contracts, since buyers initially purchased “egg” NFTs that later “hatched” into animals which could be bred into hybrids. “The mental gymnastics required to come to this conclusion are truly dizzying,” Griffin wrote. He added that plaintiffs failed to show how such purchases amounted to option contracts or contracts for future delivery. The judge did, however, recommend that the plaintiffs be given an opportunity to amend the remaining 26 claims, which span fraud, unjust enrichment, negligence, breach of contract, and violations of state consumer laws. Central to Griffin’s recommendation was the lack of evidence tying Paul personally to CryptoZoo’s downfall. He noted that much of the complaint relied on “fragments of facts” and vague attributions to “Defendants” rather than demonstrating Paul’s direct involvement or personal gain. “In some instances, plaintiffs attempt to jam together two pieces of different puzzles in the vain hope of producing a final, cohesive product,” Griffin wrote, emphasizing that legal precedent does not support such tactics. The lawsuit also names CryptoZoo co-founders Eduardo Ibanez and Jake Greenbaum. Paul has maintained that the pair misled him, leading to the project’s collapse, a claim the court previously signaled it was unlikely to accept. In January 2023, Paul pledged to reimburse buyers, setting aside $2.3 million for refunds. Claimants were compensated 0.1 ETH, roughly the original mint price of a CryptoZoo NFT in 2021, provided they agreed not to pursue legal action. Logan Paul Sues Coffeezilla Over CryptoZoo Defamation Claims Meanwhile, Paul has filed a defamation lawsuit against YouTuber Stephen Findeisen, known as Coffeezilla. Paul argues that Findeisen’s reports on CryptoZoo falsely portrayed him as defrauding his audience. Logan Paul says me interviewing people who lost money in CryptoZoo is ""milking the shit out of it"", and if I continue to do so and call this a scam: it's going to be worse for me in his lawsuit. pic.twitter.com/quDUrd4ELm — Coffeezilla (@coffeebreak_YT) January 4, 2023 The lawsuit, filed on June 27 in a San Antonio, Texas District Court, stems from videos Findeisen produced about Paul’s failed CryptoZoo non-fungible token (NFT) project in 2022. The lawsuit alleges that Findeisen “maliciously and repeatedly published false statements accusing Paul of operating a scam in connection with a troubled blockchain project called CryptoZoo.” Paul seeks to hold Findeisen accountable for his actions and the significant damage caused to his reputation through the intentional spread of defamatory falsehoods, as stated in the court filing.

MoonBull Emerges as the New Meme Coin to Beat, While Pepe Unchained and Goatseus Maximus Keep Rising",https://timestabloid.com/dreaming-of-big-gains-moonbull-emerges-as-the-new-meme-coin/,"Ever wonder how it feels to catch lightning in a bottle before the rest of the crowd even shows up? In the wild west of crypto, those who move first often walk away with the fattest bags, while latecomers are left holding peanuts. Investors across the Americas still talk about how meme coins like Doge and Shiba Inu turned early players into legends. Now the spotlight is shifting, and a brand-new chapter is unfolding with MoonBull, Pepe Unchained, and Goatseus Maximus. Right now, the new meme coin making serious noise is MoonBull . Its whitelist has just gone live, and crypto enthusiasts across the Americas are rushing to grab spots. Whitelist access means cheaper entry prices, bonus allocations, and exclusive staking perks before the public even gets a taste. For anyone who missed the past rocket rides of meme coins, MoonBull’s first-come, first-served whitelist could be the second chance they’ve been waiting for. MoonBull ($MOBU) Whitelist Madness: Why Early Access Changes the Game MoonBull is setting the stage for something bigger than a hype wave. This Ethereum-based new meme coin is built with one thing in mind: rewarding degens and meme coin lovers who know the power of being early. The whitelist is live now, and it’s not just about being first in line. It’s about locking in the lowest possible price, unlocking secret staking rewards, and even receiving private hints about future roadmap reveals before the rest of the market catches on. Scarcity is at the heart of MoonBull’s allure. Only a limited number of whitelist spots exist, and they’ll vanish as quickly as peanuts at a bull run festival. This first-come, first-served rush speaks directly to the psychology of investors who know that being first can change their financial lives. Stage One of the presale isn’t locked to whitelist members alone. Still, those who secure whitelist access get the golden ticket: the exact launch date ahead of time, private notifications, and exclusive allocations. That’s the kind of head start that can’t be ignored. How Whitelist Spots Trigger Investor Instincts Human nature is wired to crave scarcity. When something is limited, the emotional urgency skyrockets. In the crypto world, this scarcity fuels adrenaline-driven decisions, turning cautious traders into risk-takers ready to charge like bulls at a rodeo. Whitelists tap into this behavior perfectly. Nobody wants to be the penguin waddling at the back while others are flying off with the rewards. Investors know that when whitelist spots are gone, they’re gone for good, and missing out can sting harder than a market crash. MoonBull’s design capitalizes on this energy. Built on Ethereum for security and DeFi integration, it combines trustworthiness with viral meme appeal. Whitelist members get secret staking perks, bonus tokens, and exclusive roadmaps hidden from the public until launch. For traders who thrive on momentum, this isn’t just another coin. It’s a bull charging straight at the market with its horns down and eyes locked on massive gains. No wonder Moon Bull is quickly being called the new meme coin to watch this season. Is Pepe Unchained Still Worth the Hop? Pepe Unchained is the frog trying to hop its way back to glory. The token currently trades just above half a cent, with daily volume moving around the mid-six figures. Activity slipped by roughly 8% in the past day, showing signs of cooling momentum, yet the frog still sits more than 10% above its lowest point. Its market cap floats close to $7 million, which may look small compared to top-tier coins, but it still gives Pepe Unchained a stage to play on. While growth isn’t guaranteed, traders know that meme coins thrive on culture and community as much as on charts. The frog carries one of the most recognizable internet legacies, and that cultural crown still shines. Over the past week, Pepe Unchained slipped around 10% while the broader crypto market ticked up slightly. It’s like watching a penguin slide across the ice while the rest of the flock waddles forward. Yet, for many in the U.S., Mexico, and Brazil, the nostalgia of Pepe is irresistible. Fans love its unpredictability, and the wild swings are exactly what make it an adrenaline-packed play. It may not be the new meme coin leading the herd, but it’s still hopping right in the middle of the conversation. Goatseus Maximus: The Self-Proclaimed GOAT of Meme Coins Now enter Goatseus Maximus, a coin with a name that roars as loud as its market action. Trading just under ten cents, the project recently saw daily volumes surge past $13 million, a clear signal that traders are paying attention. Despite the buzz, it remains far below its past peak above the dollar mark, reminding everyone how brutal meme coin swings can be. With a market cap circling around $94 million, Goatseus Maximus already commands more weight than many smaller meme plays. Still, in the last week, its price slipped by double digits, showing that even the so-called GOAT can stumble mid-charge. For traders, that volatility is both the risk and the reward, the kind of action that can either pad a portfolio or empty it in a flash. The brand itself, though, has the meme magic that excites communities across North and South America. A coin called “GOAT” is made to attract attention, and that hype isn’t fading anytime soon. With liquidity strong and the narrative catchy, Goatseus Maximus has the raw ingredients to keep itself in the spotlight. The only question is whether it charges back toward former highs or continues grazing at current levels. Either way, it stays on the radar as one of the most unpredictable meme coins of the year. Conclusion Based on the latest research and market trends, MoonBull stands out as the most exciting new meme coin in today’s conversation. Its whitelist is live now, offering exclusive perks, low-entry access, and a rare opportunity to catch the bull before it charges into the public spotlight. The combination of scarcity, staking rewards, and secret roadmap hints makes it a once-in-a-cycle chance for early adopters. Pepe Unchained continues to fight for relevance, leaning on its cultural roots while struggling against market dips. Goatseus Maximus shows high activity and liquidity but faces challenges with price declines. Both projects have potential, but neither matches the urgency and exclusivity surrounding MoonBull’s whitelist. For anyone scanning the horizon for the next chance at massive returns, MoonBull isn’t just another option. It’s the charging bull everyone’s watching right now. For More Information: Website: https://www.moonbull.io/ Telegram: https://t.me/MoonBullCoin Twitter: https://x.com/MoonBullX FAQs Why is MoonBull considered the top new meme coin right now?

Pepe Unchained has strong cultural recognition but weaker trading momentum, making it less explosive compared to MoonBull’s whitelist hype. What makes Goatseus Maximus different from other meme coins? Goatseus Maximus combines high trading volume with extreme volatility, branding itself as a “GOAT” project with heavy liquidity. Which meme coin will explode in 2025? MoonBull is emerging as the front-runner, with massive community buzz and early investor interest suggesting it could be the breakout meme coin of 2025.

The redesigned electric SUV is larger and more spacious with a longer range, and deliveries are expected to start rolling out of the Giga Shanghai facility in September. Tesla teased the Model Y L in a video posted on the Chinese social media platform Weibo. The company told its Chinese Tesla fans to stay tuned, claiming that the six-seater electric SUV was coming soon to the local market. Compared to the standard Model Y variant, the Model Y L features a wheelbase extended by nearly 8 inches. Tesla claims the added length creates more space for adult passengers in the second and third rows. Cryptopolitan reported in July that Tesla decided to update the Model Y for the Chinese market because of dwindling sales. Declining shipments from its Shanghai facility also meant the company lagged in wholesale growth within the local EV industry. The company hopes to appeal to the local customers and divert attention from cheaper domestic EVs with similar or more features. Merritt joins the online hype to promote the Model Y L in China BREAKING: Tesla has officially introduced the Model Y L in China. • Starting price: 339,000 yuan ($47,000 USD) • Range: 527 miles (CLTC). 327 miles EPA (estimate) • 4.5s 0-62mph • 89.6cubic feet of storage • Deliveries start September 2025 in China pic.twitter.com/xDU9RZkDoZ — Sawyer Merritt (@SawyerMerritt) August 19, 2025 Sawyer Merritt, a Tesla investor, influencer, and Model Y owner, joined the Tesla online brigade to hype the official introduction of the updated Model Y L in China. The Model Y L introduces many firsts for Tesla, including retracting armrests for the second row and air-cooled wireless phone charging systems. The company put small vents under the charging pad to address the overheating issue common with high-speed wireless charging in other Teslas. The new charger supports charging speeds of up to 50W, while the previous system supported 30W speeds. Tesla has equipped the Model Y L with technology upgrades, including ventilated seats for the driver and front passenger, both with adjustable under-thigh support and headrests. Under the hood, the car comes with an 82kWh battery that delivers nearly 751 km of CLTC range. It also has a dual-motor All Wheel Drive (AWD) system with 142kW at the front and 198kW in the back. The Model Y L outperforms many competitors, including the Nio Onvo L90 and the Li Auto i8, which max out at 605 km and 720 km, respectively. Merritt also reminded his over 900K X followers that Tesla was introducing a “turn signal stalk retrofit” for the Model 3 in China. He mentioned that the fix would cost about $350. The Tesla enthusiast pointed out that the product will only be available for the leverless Model 3s produced after February 7, 2025. Those produced before will get the retrofit option later. Tesla introduces longer-range Model 3 in China Tesla also introduced its longest-range EV yet in China, the Model 3 variant, which can travel up to 515 miles (~830 km) on a single charge. The new Model 3s will have a base price of $37.49K (~RMB 269.5K), and they will expand the company’s Model 3 China offerings to four versions. The single-motor, rear-wheel-drive EV is also expected to start deliveries in September. The new Model 3s add to Tesla’s entry-level variant with rear-wheel drive and a CATL lithium iron phosphate battery. The other Model 3 has a dual-motor, an all-wheel drive system, and a longer range. An all-wheel drive performance version completes the Model 3 lineup. The long-range Model 3s will feature the LG Energy Solution 78.4kWh battery, which allows the car to accelerate from 0 to 100km/h in 5.2 seconds and maintain a top speed of 200km/h. Tesla confirmed on Weibo that all Model 3s in China have received upgrades in 2025 as part of the company’s strategy to revamp its lineup. The company also hopes to boost sales of its Model 3s by introducing a five-year interest-free financing scheme, discounts on paint jobs, and insurance subsidies, among other perks.

Following record-breaking rallies in the previous week, these cryptocurrencies have seen notable losses, with Ethereum down 5.2%, XRP dropping 3.8%, and Solana (SOL) slipping 6%. Even memecoin Dogecoin (DOGE) has not been spared, losing 5.2% of its value. Crypto Market Faces New Downturn According to a recent report by Barron’s, the recent downturn can be attributed to a combination of macroeconomic factors that have dampened investor optimism. Wholesale price data has also raised concerns about the potential for sustained high interest rates, while Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed that the US government does not plan to expand its Bitcoin reserves. Related Reading: Ethereum Hits $4,350 Liquidity Pool: Can Demand Hold? Antonio Di Giacomo, analyst at XS, emphasized the impact of macroeconomic indicators on cryptocurrency prices. He pointed out that Bitcoin’s pullback after reaching an all-time high illustrates the volatility that can accompany such rapid price movements, even as institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies continues to rise. The analyst believes that the digital asset market now appears to be balancing optimism with caution, navigating both structural demand and speculative exposure. Looking ahead, market analysts are closely watching upcoming statements from Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair Jerome Powell at the Jackson Hole Symposium. Any hints of hawkishness or delays in rate-cut expectations could further pressure risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Conversely, dovish signals may help sustain the current momentum in the market. September Challenges For Bitcoin In a recent social media post on X (formerly Twitter), market expert Doctor Profit has shared insights regarding the next price trajectory for Bitcoin. He forecasts a sideways movement within a narrow range of approximately 8% leading into September. While the medium-term outlook remains bullish, he anticipates a significant correction in September, warning that it could be a challenging month for the crypto market. Profit advises that now is the time to prepare for potential short positions, as he expects prices to decline in the coming weeks, allowing traders to buy back at lower levels. Related Reading: After Monero Hit, Qubic Group Puts Dogecoin On Target List Despite the current pullback, on-chain data reveals continued accumulation by larger wallets, indicating that major investors remain optimistic about the long-term potential of cryptocurrencies. The expert also highlighted that the funding rates also appear healthy, suggesting that the market is not facing immediate selling pressure despite the recent Bitcoin and Ethereum price declines leading the current downturn. As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $115,630, registering a 6.5% gap from the recently achieved $124,000 record. Ethereum on the other hand, has been inching closer to its all-time high with the drop stopping at the $4,300 support.

50321523,559331,1755583236,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50321523.jpeg,3 Crypto IPOs In The Pipeline Post Circle (CRLC) And Bullish (BLSH) Stellar Debut,https://bitcoinist.com/3-crypto-ipos-in-the-pipeline-post-circle/,"The recent surge in interest and adoption of digital assets has catalyzed a shift in the financial landscape, leading to a wave of successful crypto initial public offerings (IPOs). With three notable debuts on the horizon, the trend is gaining traction, driven by the impressive performance of recent market entrants. Crypto IPO Boom In the past few months, Circle (CRCL), the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, and Bullish (BLSH), a crypto exchange backed by Peter Thiel, have both experienced significant demand, resulting in substantial increases in their stock prices. This resurgence follows the earlier successes of Coinbase (COIN) and Robinhood (HOOD), which have seen their shares spike nearly 500% and 60%, respectively, over the past year. In addition, the recent market rally which saw Bitcoin (BTC) reached a new record price beyond $124,000, has created a sense of urgency among crypto and fintech operators, as highlighted by a report from The Street, which noted a growing fear of missing out (FOMO) in the sector. This renewed interest is further buoyed by favorable pro-crypto policies emerging from the US and President Donald Trump’s vision of making the country the “crypto capital of the world,” alongside rising prices. As a result, numerous firms are now vying for a spot on Wall Street. Grayscale, Gemini, And BitGo One of the frontrunners in this wave is asset manager and crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuer Grayscale. Known for its role in bringing crypto investments to mainstream finance through its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and Grayscale Ethereum Trust, the firm manages over $33 billion in assets. With plans to capitalize on its robust management fee revenue, Grayscale has confidentially filed for an initial public offering, marking an important step in its ongoing journey in the digital asset space. Next in line is Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange founded by the Winklevoss twins. After a decade of attempting to launch a Bitcoin fund, the twins pivoted to establishing their own exchange, which has since become one of the largest in the market. With crypto demand on the rise, Gemini aims to leverage its strong market position by filing for an IPO, seeking to reflect the valuation it achieved during a funding round in November 2021, which was around $7.1 billion. BitGo, a major player in crypto custody, is also preparing to join the ranks of firms seeking to go public. Custodying over $100 billion in assets, BitGo has positioned itself as a key service provider for exchanges, asset managers, and other businesses, offering a range of services including staking and trading. The firm’s substantial growth in assets suggests it is ready for a larger presence in the market, although further details will emerge once its confidential IPO filing becomes public. The recent success of Circle and Bullish underscores the potential for crypto IPOs. Both companies saw their stock prices soar upon debut, with Bullish’s shares opening at $90—a 143% increase from its IPO price—and Circle’s stock launching at $69, reflecting a 168% rise from its initial offering of $31. However, it’s worth noting that Circle’s stock has since seen a significant decline, dropping more than 50% toward its current valuation of $147, from its peak of $298 reached in June. BLSH on the other hand trades at $64, representing a 45% drop from its $117 record.

Cardano (ADA), long known as a community-driven blockchain with ambitious scalability goals, remains in the spotlight. But what has taken analysts by surprise is that one of the fastest-rising under-$1 coins, Remittix (RTX), is now being highlighted by both traders and AI-driven analysis tools as a top contender for growth. With investors seeking the best crypto to buy now , this duo of ADA and Remittix is suddenly looking like a powerful combination. Cardano’s Steady Climb: Long-Term Holders’ Bet Cardano has a disciplined, research-based approach, a loyal community, and fundamental DeFi building blocks. In August, Cardano bulls are watching keenly for developments around interoperability and the scaling upgrades planned in its roadmap. Analysts believe these could reignite momentum and potentially push Cardano back into the top tier of altcoins by market cap. However, despite its strengths, ADA’s measured growth rate leaves room for faster-moving alternatives to catch investor attention, and that’s where Remittix enters the picture. The Under-$1 Gem: Remittix Gains Momentum While Cardano has long enjoyed recognition, Remittix is the emerging altcoin that’s catching fire this August. Still priced under $1 in its presale, Remittix is being hailed as one of the best crypto opportunities of 2025 thanks to its straightforward utility in global payments and remittances . What sets Remittix apart is its Ethereum-based foundation, giving it access to one of the most secure and scalable networks in crypto. So, Remittix isn’t just talk. With a Q3 beta wallet launch, whales see imminent utility. Add its upcoming first listing on BitMart, plus other CEXs, and the upside looks sharp in comparison to the long development timelines of projects like Cardano. Whale investors are already beginning to take notice, shifting some of their focus away from established players in favor of this presale gem. The reason is simple: buying early into a payment-focused project with clear real-world use cases often translates into higher upside compared to holding only legacy altcoins. Why ChatGPT’s Pick Matters for Traders You’ve seen how the talk about AI is everywhere, and the crypto market is no exception. Today, we have numerous AI tools that offer AI-driven market insights; they can analyse sentiment, adoption trends, and tokenomics to identify coins with breakout potential.

Wedson noted that both institutional and speculative capital are accumulating LINK, creating a strong expectation for prices to rise. “Those who say the altcoin season is over don't understand good metrics,” Wedson said in his statement. “LINK will soon shine in the market. But by the time the crowd starts talking, smart investors will already be selling. You should pursue the real opportunity yourself and not listen to baseless claims from outsiders.” Related News: Altcoin Whales Have Been Very Active in Recent Hours: Here Are Their Transactions The analyst also touched on the relationship between the crypto market and macroeconomic indicators. Wedson stated that he is particularly closely monitoring ICE BofA Option-Adjusted Spreads (OASs) data. He noted that this metric has historically been a key indicator of market sentiment for Bitcoin, saying, “When OASs rise rapidly, Bitcoin typically forms local bottoms.” The ICE BofA OAS indicator measures the performance of bonds rated below investment grade (BB or lower) in the U.S. compared to Treasury bonds. According to Wedson, sudden movements in this indicator can provide important signals to buy the dip in the cryptocurrency market. *This is not investment advice.

Peter Todd, who contributed to Bitcoin’s early development, endorsed the “HAHA” Pump Fun token on X on Aug. 17. His post read, “One bad day… one good pump. Laugh your way to the moon. #HAHA.” Todd Discloses $5,000 Solana Payment For Meme Coin Promo Todd later revealed he received $5,000 in Solana for the promotion, which he immediately converted into Bitcoin. He admitted he did not know who paid him, describing the source only as “some random twitter user.” He also explained he was not required to disclose the payment as an advertisement, but did so voluntarily. Specifically, I mean someone paid me $5k USD to post the above (they didn't ask for the #Ad hashtag and notice). Dunno who they actually are. Some random twitter user. — Peter Todd (@peterktodd) August 17, 2025 “Marking paid advertisements with #Ad is a legal requirement in many countries. And it’s the honest thing to do. They didn’t negotiate an NDA on how much they paid. So there was no reason for me not to disclose that too,” he added. The token surged by 1,500% to $0.00008 immediately after his post, only to collapse 95% minutes later in a classic rug pull seen across Pump Fun launches. Within 24 hours, however, the coin staged a dramatic rebound, soaring nearly 3,900% to reach $0.0002, pushing its market cap to $225,000. Speculation Links Todd To Bitcoin’s Mysterious Creator Todd is no stranger to the crypto spotlight. He is best known for his contributions to Bitcoin Core, including writing the code that modified the OP_RETURN data carrier limit. Over the years, he has been one of the most outspoken developers in the space, often taking contrarian stances on scaling debates and industry trends. The controversy over his latest move comes against a backdrop of longstanding speculation about his identity . In Cullen Hoback’s HBO documentary Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery , Todd was even named as a potential candidate for Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin’s anonymous creator. It is a claim he firmly rejects . Hoback’s case rested on Todd’s teenage experiments with digital currency and a disputed forum post from 2010, where he allegedly forgot to switch accounts between his own name and Satoshi’s. The filmmaker also pointed to similarities in posting times, suggesting they mirrored an academic calendar. The theory, however, has been widely dismissed as speculative by most in the crypto community. Reactions to Todd’s meme coin promotion were mixed. Critics accused him of lacking integrity, while others praised his blunt disclosure, calling it a “10/10” move. Despite the uproar, Todd appeared unfazed. The polarizing response shows the uneasy balance between credibility and opportunism in crypto’s freewheeling culture.

The firm, widely recognized as a significant corporate holder of Bitcoin, completed a smaller purchase than some of its previous large-scale buys. This development has led prominent short-seller James Chanos to offer a compelling interpretation, suggesting a potential shift in the company’s financing dynamics. This situation raises important questions about the evolving MicroStrategy Bitcoin strategy and its underlying financial mechanisms. What Does a Smaller MicroStrategy Bitcoin Buy Signal? On August 18, Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor announced the firm acquired 430 BTC, valued at $51.4 million. While still a substantial investment, this figure is notably smaller compared to MicroStrategy’s prior, more aggressive Bitcoin purchases. James Chanos, a renowned short-seller famous for his successful bet against Enron, quickly weighed in on X (formerly Twitter). Chanos suggested this reduced acquisition size reflects fading demand for MicroStrategy’s preferred stock. Preferred stock is a key financing tool MicroStrategy has utilized to fund its extensive Bitcoin accumulation. A perceived weakness in demand for this stock could imply challenges in raising capital through this specific avenue for future MicroStrategy Bitcoin buys. This observation from a seasoned market analyst adds a layer of scrutiny to the company’s financial health and its ongoing commitment to Bitcoin. How Has MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Funding Strategy Evolved? The context for this smaller purchase is crucial. Following its Q2 2025 results, MicroStrategy outlined a policy regarding its stock issuance. The company stated it would issue stock below 2.5 times its market-to-net asset value (mNAV) only for specific purposes: To cover existing debt obligations. To pay preferred dividends. Significantly, not explicitly for buying more Bitcoin. The mNAV is defined as the company’s market capitalization divided by its Bitcoin holdings and operating assets. However, a more recent investor presentation introduced a new, more flexible phrase: “when otherwise deemed advantageous.” This subtle but significant addition has drawn criticism. Critics argue that this new phrasing provides management with greater leeway to sell equity, even at lower multiples, potentially impacting shareholder value. This shift directly influences how MicroStrategy Bitcoin acquisitions are funded and perceived by the market. Is Demand for MicroStrategy Bitcoin Holdings Fading? Chanos’s commentary directly addresses the implications of this financing evolution. If demand for MicroStrategy’s preferred stock is indeed weakening, it could present a challenge for the company’s ability to continue its aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy through this particular method. This scenario compels market observers to consider the potential reasons behind such a decline in demand, whether it’s broader market sentiment or specific concerns about MicroStrategy’s valuation. The company’s ability to efficiently raise capital is paramount to its long-term strategy of accumulating Bitcoin. Therefore, any perceived difficulty in doing so, especially through its established preferred stock mechanism, becomes a point of concern. This also highlights the intricate relationship between corporate finance and cryptocurrency investment, particularly for a firm so deeply invested in MicroStrategy Bitcoin holdings. Navigating the Future of MicroStrategy Bitcoin Investments Despite the recent smaller purchase and Chanos’s observations, MicroStrategy’s overall commitment to Bitcoin remains clear. The firm’s co-founder, Michael Saylor, has consistently championed Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. However, the methods and terms of future capital raises will be closely monitored by investors and analysts alike. The market will be watching to see if the “when otherwise deemed advantageous” clause leads to further equity sales and how these sales impact the company’s stock performance relative to its Bitcoin holdings. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for anyone tracking institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. MicroStrategy’s approach offers a unique case study in leveraging traditional finance tools for digital asset accumulation. The ongoing narrative around MicroStrategy Bitcoin strategy continues to provide valuable insights into the evolving landscape of corporate crypto integration. In conclusion, MicroStrategy’s recent smaller Bitcoin purchase, coupled with James Chanos’s insightful commentary, underscores a dynamic period for the company. While its dedication to Bitcoin remains a core tenet, the mechanisms for funding these significant acquisitions are clearly under increasing scrutiny. This situation offers valuable lessons on the complexities of corporate cryptocurrency strategies and the ever-present interplay between market perception and financial maneuvers. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is MicroStrategy’s primary strategy regarding Bitcoin? A1: MicroStrategy’s primary strategy is to acquire and hold Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset, believing it offers a superior long-term store of value compared to traditional fiat currencies. Q2: Who is James Chanos and why are his comments significant? A2: James Chanos is a renowned short-seller known for identifying overvalued companies. His comments are significant because they offer an experienced market analyst’s critical perspective on MicroStrategy’s financing methods and the implications for its Bitcoin acquisition strategy. Q3: How does MicroStrategy typically finance its Bitcoin purchases? A3: MicroStrategy has primarily financed its Bitcoin purchases through various methods, including issuing convertible senior notes and, as highlighted in this article, selling preferred stock. Q4: What is the significance of the “when otherwise deemed advantageous” clause? A4: This clause in MicroStrategy’s investor presentation suggests greater flexibility for management to sell equity (issue stock) even at lower market multiples, potentially to fund operations or acquisitions beyond previously stated restrictions, which critics view as a broadening of their financing options. Q5: What is the “market-to-net asset value (mNAV)”? A5: The market-to-net asset value (mNAV) is a metric MicroStrategy uses, defined as its market capitalization divided by the combined value of its Bitcoin holdings and its operating assets. It helps assess the premium or discount at which the company’s stock trades relative to its underlying assets. Share Your Thoughts!

Traders buy and sell contracts on Kalshi, a regulated US prediction market where people bet on real events. The “best AI model of 2025” bet will close on Dec. 31, 2025, and the result will come from the LM Arena Leaderboard, a public platform that ranks and compares top AI models. Kalshi traders raise Gemini above ChatGPT and Grok People are placing real money on the outcome of the AI race, and Gemini’s odds rose to 59% on Tuesday from 48.1% just a day earlier. These results show just how much traders have confidence in its potential. OpenAI’s ChatGPT saw its bets drop to 20% from 25.4%, while Elon Musk’s Grok went from 18.8% to 15%. Users and investors now believe Gemini will catch up and surpass its rivals due to Google’s consistent release of updates . On the other hand, betters have lost confidence in ChatGPT and Grok, and their ability to lead the market in the long term because of their setbacks. These signals make more sense than regular predictions because Kalshi’s contracts are tied to money, meaning traders weigh risks and rewards whenever odds change. This AI race is getting a lot of attention from traders, investors, and tech watchers, as seen in the $7.4 million in trading volume generated from the “best AI model of 2025” contracts on Kalshi. Larger trading volumes in the market reduce the risk of bias and strengthen the reliability of the outcome because they prove that many different participants are responsible for setting the odds and not a small group. Traders who put their money on Google’s model may receive payouts based on their positions if Gemini maintains its current lead until the contracts close on December 31, 2025. Those who backed ChatGPT and Grok, on the other hand, may lose their stakes. Google strengthens Gemini while rivals struggle to keep pace Google’s steady updates attract user interest and confidence from the market. At its recent annual I/O developer conference, Google revealed that its advanced Gemini AI assistant will soon be integrated into vehicles . This latest expansion brings Gemini’s capabilities to cars supporting Android Auto and Android Automotive. Swedish automaker Volvo, a longtime Google partner, is set to be the first to implement Gemini across its entire model lineup via the Android Automotive system. Volvo confirmed it will be the reference hardware platform for Google’s automotive AI development. The company also announced multiple improvements on August 15, like the new storybook mode for creating interactive narratives and an upgraded reasoning model for the system to provide accurate answers. It also introduced temporary chats that don’t store user history. These new features show that Gemini is evolving quickly to meet people’s needs, while also addressing concerns about privacy and personalization to make it more useful for everyday users. For OpenAI, the release of ChatGPT-5 did not live up to user expectations. CEO Sam Altman even had to defend the model on X after users complained about performance, usefulness, and overall quality . Elon Musk’s xAI also struggled to convince users that it can compete with larger, more established models. However, people accuse Grok of being biased because it has produced political content that users claim favors one political side. New competitors in the market are also proving that they can compete with Google, OpenAI, and xAI, as Perplexity has offered a massive $34.5 billion cash offer to buy Google’s Chrome browser. This move shows that smaller players can also influence how people access AI services in the future. China’s DeepSeek also released a model that can solve advanced mathematical problems called Prover 2, making it a serious competitor and the AI contest even more unpredictable.

At the same time, XRP and fast-rising altcoin MAGACOIN FINANCE are catching attention from traders seeking the best altcoins to buy now, with analysts eyeing 20x price moves this cycle. Bitcoin ETFs Push Volume to $40 Billion Bitcoin ETFs just logged their most active trading week to date, with combined Bitcoin and Ether products surpassing $40 billion in weekly turnover. ETF analyst Eric Balchunas described it as the “biggest week ever,” pointing to Ether’s contribution after months of dormancy. Bitcoin itself reached a new all-time high of $124,000 before retracing to $117,659. Despite the dip, market watchers believe ETF-driven flows will keep interest high. The scale of demand mirrors Bitcoin’s initial ETF launch in January 2024, which drove prices upward for weeks. With trading activity accelerating, Bitcoin continues to dominate market headlines while reinforcing the growing influence of ETFs in crypto adoption. Ethereum and XRP Hold Spotlight Ethereum’s performance has been driven by surging ETF inflows. Ether ETFs recorded their best-ever week with $17 billion in trading volume, including a single-day net inflow above $1 billion. Analysts suggest this surge has parallels with Bitcoin’s ETF-driven rally earlier in the year. On August 13, Ethereum closed at $4,475, its best weekly finish since late 2021, reflecting renewed institutional confidence. At the same time, Ethereum’s daily network usage remains high, with nearly 47 million transactions recorded in July, supported by stablecoins, DeFi protocols, and layer-2 activity. With ETF products absorbing large amounts of supply, many traders now view Ethereum as the best altcoin to buy now. XRP, meanwhile, is under the microscope following the conclusion of Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC. The token rallied briefly above $3.30 but has since corrected to $2.95. Market voices note that earlier optimism was already priced in, leaving the coin in need of stronger adoption catalysts. Analysts remain divided: some expect XRP to hover near current levels, while others believe broader crypto market growth could push it to $10–$12 or even higher before the end of 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Traction as Altcoin Pick Amid the spotlight on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly climbing watchlists. Analysts point to its growing presence as one of the best altcoins to buy now, with forecasts ranging from 35x to as high as 15,000x. Prices are increasing every hour during its current cycle, creating urgency among those looking for early entry before exchange listings. MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing attention not only as a meme coin but also for its DeFi use cases, making it a unique contender in the fast-moving altcoin space. Main Takeaway With Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs driving record-breaking inflows and XRP navigating post-lawsuit uncertainty, attention is turning toward altcoins that could deliver outsized gains this cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE is firmly on that list, with analysts calling it one of the best altcoins to buy now as prices accelerate quickly. Access MAGACOIN FINANCE via the official website.

Among them are Cardano, DOGE, XRP, XLM, LINK, TRX, and the fast-rising MAGACOIN FINANCE. While large-cap names remain critical to the market, these smaller altcoins are gaining traction as some of the most compelling high-upside plays for the next cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE — Presale Momentum Accelerates With ADA and SOL in focus, analysts are spotlighting MAGACOIN FINANCE as the standout. Forecasts of 50x returns and accelerating whale inflows mean allocations are running out quickly. Already raising millions in presale funding, the project is being recognized as one of the fastest-growing small-cap opportunities in the market. Backed by scarcity-driven tokenomics and mounting demand, MAGACOIN FINANCE is earning comparisons to early-stage breakouts like SHIB and Solana during their formative growth phases. Analysts suggest that its unique narrative and rising market visibility could make it one of the most powerful performers in the upcoming cycle. Cardano (ADA) — Smart Contract Growth Story Despite the volatility in the broader crypto market, Cardano is holding strong around $0.95 as it continues to consolidate. ADA is favored for a breakout with whale inflows and institutional adoption on the rise if it clears resistance at 0.98. Analysts believe Cardano could shoot towards $1.25 in the short term and maybe $2+ in the next full cycle amid its rising DeFi and smart contract ecosystem. Dogecoin (DOGE) — Meme Power Remains Strong DOGE remains one of the most traded cryptos, with whales continuing to accumulate and momentum cooling. It remains relevant as a speculative asset with a potential to surprise owing to its community strength and integration in the payment network. According to analysts, DOGE has the potential to once again become one of the best-performing altcoins of 2025. XRP — Institutional Payments Leader XRP takes the lead in cross-border payments and is one of the most well-positioned assets. With reinforcement above $2.90, XRP has been the recent target of institutional flows and ETF speculation believed to be a long-term hold for whales building on large positions as it trades near $3.05. Stellar (XLM) — Expanding Real-World Use Cases XLM trades around $0.41 and continues to secure adoption in the remittance and payments sector. Its partnerships with financial institutions support long-term stability, and analysts expect the token to deliver consistent growth as utility-driven adoption expands. Chainlink (LINK) — The Oracle Powerhouse LINK is trading near $25, supported by a growing network of partnerships and infrastructure expansion. With bullish targets between $26 and $30, Chainlink’s role as the leading blockchain oracle solution ensures lasting demand, making it one of the most dependable mid-cap picks for long-term growth. TRON (TRX) — Transaction Throughput Leader TRX trades around $0.349, with whale support helping it maintain momentum above its 50-day average of $0.316. Its consistently high transaction throughput and utility in blockchain applications provide stability, even as broader market sentiment fluctuates.

Regulators pointed to a recent incident at Bithumb where more than 27,000 customers tapped lending services in June, with 13% forced into liquidation after collateral values swung against them. The move by the FSC comes days after analysts at Galaxy Digital published a report where they flagged the growing amount of leverage in crypto markets as a concern. The administrative guidance, from the FSC allows existing loans to run their course but bars the rollout of new lending services. Officials said that if platforms ignore the directive, on-site inspections and other supervisory actions will follow. Formal lending guidelines are expected in the coming months. Korea's crackdown lands as crypto leverage globally surges back toward bull-market levels. Galaxy's report shows crypto-collateralized loans jumped 27% in Q2 to $53.1 billion, the highest since early 2022. Last week’s $1 billion liquidation wave , sparked by bitcoin’s retreat from $124,000 to $118,000, highlighted how quickly overstretched bets can unwind. Analysts warn that stress points are already showing across the system: DeFi liquidity crunches, ETH staking exit queues, and widening spreads between on-chain and over-the-counter dollar lending rates. However, not everyone agrees with the approach the Korean authorities are taking. DNTV Research's Bradley Park argues that better safeguards are needed, and not a shutdown. “The rational approach is to upgrade UI/UX, risk disclosures, and LTV controls to manage exposure safely,” Park told CoinDesk in a note, noting that most exchange lending is in stablecoins used to build short positions. He added that the regulator’s real concern may be market-structure distortions, such as the negative kimchi premium, rather than the service itself. Park said that transparency gaps also complicate oversight: Bithumb discloses the scale of its lending activity , but Upbit, the country’s largest exchange, does not. That opacity could make it harder for regulators to judge systemic risks and may be a key factor behind the blanket suspension. “Until these structural issues are addressed, reopening may take time; priority should be understanding the mechanism and adopting a data-driven design, rather than blanket restrictions,” he concluded.

This movement suggests a potentially bullish shift in investor behavior, even amidst fluctuating market conditions. Understanding these outflows is crucial for anyone tracking Bitcoin’s next move and anticipating market shifts. What Do Bitcoin Withdrawals Signify? When investors pull their Bitcoin off centralized exchanges, it often indicates a shift from short-term trading to longer-term holding. Crypto analyst Axel Adler Jr. recently highlighted a notable increase in net outflows from these platforms. The 30-day average has seen a significant drop, moving from -1,700 to -3,400 BTC per day. This trend means that more Bitcoin is leaving exchanges than entering them. Essentially, investors are moving their assets into personal wallets, such as hardware wallets or cold storage, where they have full control. This action typically suggests an intent to hold rather than sell immediately, reducing the readily available supply on exchanges. Why Are These BTC Outflows Bullish? In a falling or sideways market, a surge in Bitcoin withdrawals can act as a strong bullish signal. Axel Adler Jr. specifically pointed out that this pattern, when seen during a market downturn, can signal a “bullish divergence.” But what does that truly mean for Bitcoin’s price trajectory? A bullish divergence occurs when the price of an asset is declining or consolidating, but an underlying metric, like exchange outflows, indicates growing strength or accumulation. It suggests that despite the current price action, smart money or long-term holders are actively buying the dip and securing their assets off-exchange. This often precedes a price recovery or a new upward trend. Accumulation Phase: Investors are using lower prices as an opportunity to buy more Bitcoin, seeing it as a long-term investment rather than a quick trade. Reduced Selling Pressure: With less BTC available on exchanges, there is less immediate supply that can be quickly sold, potentially leading to price increases when demand eventually rises. Long-Term Conviction: Moving coins off-exchange signifies a belief in Bitcoin’s future value, indicating a strong conviction from holders who are less likely to sell during short-term volatility. Is This a Crucial Indicator for Bitcoin’s Future? The increasing trend of Bitcoin withdrawals is indeed a crucial indicator for market observers. Historically, periods of significant net outflows have often preceded price rallies or marked the end of bearish cycles. While past performance is not indicative of future results, this pattern provides valuable insight into investor sentiment and supply dynamics, offering a glimpse into underlying market strength. Consider the broader implications: if a substantial amount of Bitcoin is being withdrawn and held, it reduces the circulating supply readily available for trading on exchanges. This supply squeeze, combined with consistent demand, can create significant upward pressure on Bitcoin’s price, potentially leading to a bullish surge. What Should Investors Consider Regarding Bitcoin Withdrawals? While the current trend of Bitcoin withdrawals is encouraging, it is important for investors to consider a holistic view of the market. No single indicator guarantees future price movements. Other factors such as macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments, and institutional adoption also play significant roles in shaping the cryptocurrency landscape. For those looking to act on this information, here are some actionable insights to consider: Monitor On-Chain Data: Keep an eye on exchange flow metrics and other on-chain indicators regularly to track shifts in investor behavior. Diversify Your Portfolio: Do not rely solely on one signal; spread your investments across different assets and strategies to mitigate risk. Practice Self-Custody: If you plan to hold Bitcoin long-term, consider moving your assets to a secure personal wallet. This aligns with the trend of increased withdrawals and enhances your control over your digital assets. In conclusion, the rising net outflows of Bitcoin from centralized exchanges, as highlighted by analyst Axel Adler Jr., offer a compelling case for a potential bullish divergence. This pattern suggests that investors are actively accumulating BTC, moving it off platforms, and signaling a strong long-term conviction in the asset. While the market remains dynamic, this trend provides a powerful glimpse into the underlying strength of Bitcoin’s investor base, potentially setting the stage for future positive price action. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly are Bitcoin withdrawals from exchanges? A1: Bitcoin withdrawals refer to the movement of BTC from centralized cryptocurrency exchanges (like Binance or Coinbase) to private, non-custodial wallets. This means the investor takes direct control of their coins, rather than leaving them on the exchange. Q2: Why are increased Bitcoin withdrawals considered bullish? A2: Increased withdrawals are often seen as bullish because they indicate that investors intend to hold their Bitcoin for the long term (HODL) rather than sell it. This reduces the immediate selling pressure on exchanges and can signal an accumulation phase, especially during market downturns. Q3: Who is Axel Adler Jr. and what is his analysis based on? A3: Axel Adler Jr. is a crypto analyst who uses on-chain data to identify market trends. His analysis on Bitcoin withdrawals is based on tracking the net flow of BTC in and out of centralized exchanges, observing significant shifts in the 30-day average. Q4: Does this mean Bitcoin’s price will definitely go up soon? A4: While increased Bitcoin withdrawals are a strong bullish indicator, no single metric guarantees future price movements. The crypto market is influenced by many factors, including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory news, and overall market sentiment. It suggests a higher probability of bullish movement but is not a certainty. Q5: How can I track Bitcoin exchange outflows myself? A5: You can track Bitcoin exchange outflows using various on-chain analytics platforms like Glassnode, CryptoQuant, or Santiment. These platforms provide detailed data on exchange balances and net flows, allowing you to monitor these trends in real-time.

As of August 2025, TVL has grown more than 45% year-over-year. The protocol now dominates its category. It’s not a side play anymore. It is the yield layer of DeFi. The mechanics drive the growth. Pendle splits a yield-bearing asset into two parts: Principal Token (PT): The base. Redeemable at maturity. Yield Token (YT): The stream. Claims all yield until maturity. This split is simple but powerful. PTs give asset exposure. YTs isolate yield. Farmers, hedgers, and traders all find their angle. Impermanent loss shrinks. Strategies expand. Capital works harder.

Users lock tokens for up to two years. Locked supply earns: Governance rights Protocol fee share Boosted rewards Currently, 37% of total supply is locked. That’s long-term conviction. Emissions drop 1.1% weekly until 2026, then stabilize at 2% inflation per year. The curve rewards early holders and sustains liquidity. Roadmap: What’s Next For Pendle Pendle is not done building. Boros: Tokenizing perpetual futures funding-rate yield. A move into a derivatives market with $150B+ in daily open interest. Citadels: Institutional-grade yield. KYC-compliant. Shariah-compliant. Bridges traditional and Islamic finance into DeFi rails. Multi-Chain Expansion: Beyond Ethereum. Building on Solana, TON, and Hyperliquid. Non-EVM ecosystems are next. Every step expands reach. Every step adds new demand. Meanwhile: • Pendle just hit $515M in @hyperliquidx HyperEVM after 2.5 weeks, making us the #3 largest DeFi protocol now on HyperEVM • @kinetiq_xyz has also grown to be our 2nd largest protocol at $410M TVL • @boros_fi continues to build good traction, with $35M of daily OI… — TN | Pendle (@tn_pendle) August 18, 2025 Pendle’s integrations keep climbing.

Boros itself shows momentum, $35M daily OI and $183M total notional trading volume. These are not pilot programs. These are real flows. Market Outlook Analysts call for PENDLE to reach a maximum of $4.87 by end of 2025. That’s the conservative line. With TVL compounding and new products going live, upside could break those projections. Pendle is evolving into the fixed income backbone of crypto. It’s not just about farming yield anymore. It’s about structuring yield. Tokenizing it. Trading it. And giving DeFi what traditional finance has had for decades: fixed income markets. Final Take Every maturity looks like a stress test. Each time billions exit, the protocol absorbs it. And each time, Pendle climbs back, stronger, with a higher ATH. In just two years, Pendle went from an unknown to a DeFi giant. The metrics prove it. The ecosystem proves it. And the market keeps rewarding it. Pendle isn’t chasing hype. It’s building rails. And every bounce higher shows those rails are working.

A pseudonymous South Korean trader, known only as AOA, certainly seems to have cracked a code, reportedly transforming a modest 5,000 USDT into an astonishing 300 million USDT by 2024. His incredible journey has captivated the crypto community, and now, he’s shared some invaluable insights. At the heart of his philosophy lies a simple yet powerful strategy: learn to buy the dips . Mastering the Crypto Market: Why Buy the Dips? AOA recently held a brief Q&A session on a local online forum, shedding light on his trading principles. He emphasized that while traditional technical analysis (TA) still holds considerable value for understanding chart patterns and price action, understanding broader macroeconomic factors is now paramount for making informed trading decisions. This shift reflects the increasing maturity and complexity of the crypto market, where global economic trends, interest rates, and geopolitical events can significantly influence price movements. One of AOA’s core beliefs is to avoid the common pitfall of chasing market rallies. Instead, he advocates for a disciplined and patient approach: waiting for significant price corrections or pullbacks and then strategically buying when assets are cheaper. This strategy of “buy the dips” is designed to maximize potential gains by acquiring assets at lower entry points, rather than succumbing to the fear of missing out (FOMO) and buying into euphoria at peak prices. It’s about being contrarian when others are fearful. Risk Management: The Unchanging Rule for Crypto Success Regardless of market conditions or personal trading style, AOA stresses that robust risk management remains the fundamental, unchanging rule of trading. This principle is absolutely paramount for preserving capital and ensuring long-term sustainability in such a high-stakes environment. Without strict risk management protocols, even the most promising strategies or fortunate market calls can lead to significant, irreversible losses. It’s about understanding your capital, setting stop-losses, and never over-leveraging. He also observed a notable shift in the crypto landscape: the increasing presence of institutional inflows. While these large-scale investments from hedge funds and corporations bring greater stability and legitimacy to the market, AOA believes they have also reduced the number of “retail success stories” like his own. This suggests that the early, wild west days of easy, outsized gains for individual traders might be evolving, making strategic discipline, like knowing precisely when and how to buy the dips , even more critical for success. Navigating Altcoins and Entry Points: When to Buy the Dips? When questioned about specific assets, AOA shared his current perspective on Ethereum (ETH), viewing it as currently too expensive to buy at its present levels. This highlights his disciplined approach to valuation – he patiently waits for significant pullbacks or more attractive entry points rather than buying at what he perceives as inflated prices. He also mentioned holding no significant altcoin positions, though he conceded that altcoins could still see substantial pumps if the broader Bitcoin bull run continues its momentum. AOA’s own financial journey provides a compelling, real-world example of navigating market cycles. His assets under management (AUM) peaked at an impressive 340 billion won (approximately $245 million) in early 2022, subsequently dropped to 130 billion won ($93.6 million) in 2023 during the bear market, and have since largely recovered. This demonstrates the volatile nature of cryptocurrency investments and the immense importance of either holding through downturns or strategically re-entering during “dips” for recovery and growth. Perhaps the most sobering insight from AOA is his belief that the absolute best entry points for this current cycle might already be gone. He reiterates a timeless investment adage that applies universally: buy when cheap, sell when overpriced . This fundamental wisdom underpins the entire “buy the dips” philosophy – identifying undervalued opportunities and capitalizing on them before the broader market recognizes their true potential. It’s about foresight and patience. In conclusion, AOA’s extraordinary success story offers invaluable lessons for any crypto enthusiast looking to navigate the complex digital asset landscape. His core message is crystal clear: prioritize a deep understanding of macro factors, implement strict and unwavering risk management, and most importantly, resist the urge to chase parabolic rallies. Instead, cultivate the patience and discipline to strategically buy the dips . This approach, while seemingly simple, demands foresight, conviction, and a long-term perspective, potentially leading to remarkable outcomes even in the unpredictable world of cryptocurrency. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Who is AOA? AOA is a pseudonymous South Korean crypto trader who reportedly grew 5,000 USDT into nearly 300 million USDT by 2024, sharing his insights on crypto trading strategies. What is AOA’s main crypto trading strategy? AOA’s primary strategy is to skip chasing market rallies and instead, patiently wait to buy the dips – acquiring assets during price corrections when they are cheaper. Why does AOA emphasize risk management? AOA stresses risk management as the unchanging, fundamental rule of trading to preserve capital and ensure long-term sustainability in the highly volatile cryptocurrency market. Does AOA recommend buying altcoins? Currently, AOA holds no significant altcoin positions and views Ethereum (ETH) as too expensive. He notes altcoins could pump if the bull run continues, but his focus is on disciplined entry points. What does AOA mean by “best entry points may already be gone”? This suggests that the most favorable opportunities to buy assets at very low prices during the current market cycle might have passed, reinforcing his advice to always “buy when cheap, sell when overpriced.” Did AOA’s insights resonate with your crypto trading philosophy?

The most significant of these was undoubtedly the passage of the GENIUS Act (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins), which regulates tablecoins. The GENIUS law, which went through the necessary stages, finally came before US President Donald Trump and was signed into law by Trump. While the approval of the GENIUS law is welcomed, it is stated that the stablecoin market will experience incredible growth and reach trillions of dollars. At this point, South Korean investment bank iM Securities said that they expect stablecoins to threaten XRP's number 3 position in the future. iM Securities analysts said in a recent report that the stablecoin market, currently valued at around $270 billion, will grow rapidly, increasing competition in the cryptocurrency sector. Analysts noted that with the start of the crypto-friendly Trump 2.0 administration, the stablecoin market has rapidly reached nearly $270 billion. Analysts have warned that this growth in stablecoins poses a threat to XRP. At this point, it was stated that stablecoins will experience a rapid rise with factors such as increasing growth and usage, and XRP could threaten its status as the third-largest cryptocurrency. While stablecoins are pegged 1:1 to fiat currencies, limiting the risk of price volatility, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and XRP are subject to fluctuations driven by market supply and demand, making them less suitable for international money transfers. At this point, given the growing market around stablecoins and other positive factors, stablecoins are expected to threaten XRP's status as the third-largest currency.” *This is not investment advice.

There are officially only 6 weeks left until the inaugural SPiCE Central Asia 2025 – the premier summit for stakeholders tracking one of today’s most intriguing gaming markets! Join us in Tashkent, Uzbekistan from 25 – 26 September 2025 , where key players across the gaming industry, policy circles, and technology sectors will come together to explore the pivotal shift in Central Asia’s gaming ecosystem, as regulation begins to take shape alongside exciting economic and technological opportunities. With Uzbekistan positioning itself on the cusp of becoming a significant player in the global gaming arena, SPiCE Central Asia 2025 will offer rare and valuable insights into the region’s rapidly developing market dynamics and the frameworks that could guide its sustainable growth. Expert View: George Mamulaishvili on SPiCE Central Asia’s Potential to Transform the Market As we approach the summit, George Mamulaishvili , Head of Administration at the Georgian Gambling Association and a leading speaker, is sharing exclusive insights on regulation, collaboration, and growth strategies that could shape the future of the region’s gaming industry. On the role SPiCE Central Asia 2025 will play in transforming Uzbekistan’s gaming market, he said: “Any industry conference held in the region provides an additional boost to sectoral development. SPiCE has already established itself as a reliable brand and offers a platform for building sustainable communication between business and regulators. Government representatives always closely monitor market dynamics, and every professional event helps to strengthen trust in the sector. SPiCE is exactly the kind of platform that brings together a wide range of experts and can make a meaningful contribution to the future growth of the industry.” He further explained how responsible regulation can boost the region’s gaming growth while ensuring safety and long-term sustainability: “Every regulated sector, especially the gaming industry, contains delicate balances: sound regulation can stimulate the growth of the legal segment, while excessive restrictions may instead create conditions for the illegal market to expand. Missteps, such as over-regulation or sharp tax increases, may deliver short-term fiscal gains but often lead to long-term damage, reduced investor confidence, and capital flight. That’s why governments must engage in ongoing dialogue with the industry and listen to expert opinions. The responsibility for sustainable growth should be shared between the state and the private sector.” On bridging gaps between regulators, operators, and industry stakeholders: “A conference is, first and foremost, a platform for open dialogue. Experts participating in SPiCE share their experience and perspectives on key issues – from regulatory frameworks to responsible gaming. This enables regulators to engage in constructive discussion, hear real-world case studies, and potentially adapt best international practices to local contexts. Such interaction brings stakeholders closer together and helps form a mature and sustainable market environment.” George’s advice for those preparing to enter Uzbekistan’s and the wider Central Asian regulatory environment: “[In] my view, one thing deserves special attention: operators and suppliers should not compete for regulatory influence individually but should instead unite and build a constructive dialogue on behalf of the industry. Collaborative engagement with regulators tends to yield far better results than isolated efforts.” Here’s why he considers SPiCE Central Asia 2025 a can’t-miss event for those leading the industry: “SPiCE in other regions has already demonstrated that even new events can bring enormous value. This will be an excellent opportunity to come together, discuss current challenges, share experiences, learn something new, and – importantly – position oneself as a professional. Such events foster new relationships, strengthen existing ones, and even enable constructive interaction with competitors. SPiCE is not just a conference; it’s an investment in growth. Even industry leaders need to keep evolving and stay on top of trends, as this sector changes rapidly. SPiCE Central Asia provides precisely the environment where one can learn, grow, and influence the future of the industry.” Get Ready to Network with These Influential Industry Experts: Asad Kambarov , CEO/CMO, iGlow Media Bibigul Baidildanova , Legal Counsel Dea Nebieridze , Partnerships and Community Manager Džangar Jesenov , Head of Compliance, Endorphina Ekaterine Lomsadze , Account Manager George Mamulaishvili , Head of Administration, Georgian Gambling Association George Paliani , Co-Founder, Futurum Giorgi Tsamalaidze , CLO, Random Systems Georgia Göktuğ Boğaç Ögel , Head of Technology & Product Lasha Kiladze , CMO, Luxeya Max Yarmukhametov , SEO Team Lead Mukhammad Murodov , Product Owner, Brofist Partners Natalia Moskvina , Founder & General Manager, Lexonix Orkhan Zakirov , General Manager, Adigy Agency Valentin Rash , SEO Lead AND MANY MORE!

To shore up its finances, the exchange has secured a $75 million credit line from its rival, Ripple. The deal comes as the Winklevoss-led company makes a high-stakes gamble on going public. Crypto exchange Gemini is turning to a surprising source for a lifeline as it prepares to go public: its rival, Ripple Labs. The Winklevoss-led exchange has secured a $75 million credit line from Ripple, a deal disclosed in Gemini’s S-1 filing with the SEC that comes as the exchange is grappling with major losses. Details on the Ripple-Gemini Deal According to the filing , Gemini can borrow in increments of $5 million or more under the credit agreement, with interest rates reaching up to 8.5% annually. While the current borrowing cap stands at $75 million, it may be increased to $150 million subject to certain conditions. Initially, Gemini can only draw in US dollars, but additional borrowing may be denominated in Ripple USD (RLUSD), a stablecoin Ripple launched in December 2024.

Here’s What Crypto and Nasdaq Market Breadth Indicates,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/08/19/is-bitcoin-s-bull-run-losing-steam-here-s-what-crypto-and-nasdaq-market-breadth-indicates,"Market breadth, a key indicator used to understand the overall health of a market or an index, indicates that both the crypto market and Wall Street's tech-heavy index, the Nasdaq, are experiencing short-term weakness within a long-term uptrend. Breadth is typically measured by comparing the number of advancing stocks or cryptocurrencies to those declining. Traders also analyze the number of assets trading above or below key moving averages—such as the 50-day and 200-day SMAs—to assess both short-term and long-term market trends. This article focuses specifically on these moving average-based breadth indicators. As of writing, 63 of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market value, including bitcoin (BTC), traded above their respective 200-day simple moving average (SMA), according to data source TradingView. The top 100 coins have market capitalizations of over $1 billion and are less prone to price manipulation than their smaller counterparts. At the same time, 50 coins traded below their 50-day SMAs. Interestingly, Nasdaq, which comprises 100 stocks, displayed a similar profile on Monday, with 61 stocks trading above their 200-day SMAs and 49 below their 50-day SMAs. Implications The data indicates that the long-term trend for both markets remains bullish with a clear majority of assets trading above their 200-day SMAs. The 200-day average is widely tracked as a barometer for long-term trends by both retail and institutional investors. That said, the immediate outlook is steadily worsening as 50% of assets in both markets trade below the 50-day SMA, which is a short-term trend indicator. A price below this average suggests a recent loss of momentum and a potential short-term downtrend. The identical market breadth of the two markets suggests that the short-term weakness is not an isolated event, but a widespread phenomenon affecting both cryptocurrency and traditional markets. Perhaps, traders in both markets are de-risking their portfolios ahead of the impending speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell at the Jackson Hole symposium this week.

Positioned at the forefront of decentralized finance innovation, Mutuum Finance is trending with its unique staking model and lending platform, drawing comparisons to early crypto giants. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is standing at $0.035 as it is still in presale phase 6. MUTM early investors are set for rapid 500% gains when the project launches. In addition, analyst projections forecast 1000x growth in the long run to match Bitcoin’s rise. Mutuum Finance has already raised more than $14.6 million from more than 15400 investors. While mainstream media remains fixated on BTC’s past surges, insiders are keeping a close eye on emerging protocols like Mutuum that could redefine the next wave of crypto growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Two-Tier DeFi Lending Structure Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a new non-custodial decentralized DeFi protocol. The protocol enables Peer-to-Contract lending and Peer-to-Peer lending with efficiency and flexibility as the aim. Peer-to-Contract makes use of the smart contract functionality to forward loans with minimal or no human intervention. Peer-to-Peer eliminates intermediaries and has lenders and borrowers trade directly with each other. The model is rather easy to manage risky assets like meme coins. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Enters Token Presale Phase 6 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is picking up steam as its presale makes the news. It is currently in phase 6 at $0.035. Its price in the next phase will be increased by 14.29% to $0.04. Investment interest is growing with the project already raising over $14.6 million and already having over 15400 token holders. Mutuum Finance to Introduce USD-Pegged Stablecoin Mutuum Finance is launching its overcollateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. With a robust foundation that can survive the collapse of algorithmic designs, the stablecoin has the capacity to maintain stability and consistency over a long period of time. The project is also backed by a 95.0 trust rating from Certik. Mutuum Finance has recently launched its Bug Bounty Program with the reward pool value amounting to $50,000 USDT. It has four severity levels: critical, major, minor, and low. Mutuum Finance Giveaway Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently hosting a $100,000 giveaway where the project community is built upon. 10 investors will be eligible to win $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. A Strategic Vision for Sustainable Growth Mutuum Finance formed its tokenomics framework to facilitate sustainable value through proper management of liquidity and security mechanisms with anti-inflationary protection. The basis for long-term token price appreciation originates from a controlled distribution process during the presale phase combined with proper management strategies. Deflation mechanisms operate in the long term to reduce network supply which causes scarcity resulting in greater price growth potential in the long term. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself as a standout DeFi opportunity for investors seeking the next wave of crypto growth. With a dual lending structure, a fully collateralized USD-pegged stablecoin, audited security measures, and an active presale raising over $14.6 million, the project combines innovation with robust fundamentals. Early-stage investors stand to benefit from presale pricing and a controlled token distribution that encourages long-term sustainability. For those looking to capture significant upside in the years ahead, Mutuum Finance offers a rare chance to participate in a project with the potential to redefine decentralized finance, and possibly achieve exponential returns by 2030.

Recently, a significant trend has emerged concerning Bitcoin capitulation , where short-term holders are selling their BTC at a loss. This phenomenon, highlighted by insights from CryptoQuant, offers crucial clues about the current health and future direction of the market. What Exactly is Bitcoin Capitulation? According to Kripto Mevsimi, a respected contributor at CryptoQuant, the current market phase sees short-term Bitcoin (BTC) holders selling their assets below their purchase price. This action is often referred to as ‘capitulation.’ It signifies a point where investors, particularly those who bought recently, give up hope and exit the market, even if it means incurring losses. CryptoQuant.com shared these observations, emphasizing that such periods are not merely signs of weakness but are also vital indicators of underlying market dynamics. Understanding this Bitcoin capitulation helps us gauge investor sentiment and potential turning points. Why Does Short-Term Selling Matter for BTC’s Future? When short-term holders sell at a loss, it creates selling pressure. However, the market’s ability to absorb this supply is paramount. If stronger hands—often long-term investors or institutions—step in to buy these discounted coins, it signals robust demand. This absorption can prevent further price declines and even lay the groundwork for a future rebound. Conversely, if there is insufficient demand to absorb the selling pressure, it could indicate weakening momentum, potentially leading to prolonged price stagnation or further drops. Therefore, monitoring the absorption rate during periods of Bitcoin capitulation is crucial for assessing market resilience. Is This a Buying Opportunity or a Warning Sign? The interpretation of short-term holders selling at a loss depends on various factors. Historically, periods of capitulation have often preceded market bottoms, presenting attractive entry points for long-term investors. It’s a cleansing process, flushing out weaker hands and leaving behind those with stronger conviction. However, it’s not a guaranteed ‘buy the dip’ signal. Traders and investors must consider broader macroeconomic factors, regulatory developments, and on-chain metrics. While Bitcoin capitulation can be a precursor to a rebound, careful analysis is always advised to mitigate risks. Key Takeaways for Navigating Market Volatility: Monitor Absorption: Pay close attention to how quickly the market absorbs the selling pressure from short-term holders. High absorption indicates strength. Long-Term Perspective: Capitulation phases often reward those with a long-term investment horizon, as they can accumulate assets at lower prices. Diversify Analysis: Do not rely solely on one indicator. Combine CryptoQuant’s insights with other on-chain data, technical analysis, and fundamental factors. Risk Management: Always employ sound risk management strategies, especially during volatile periods characterized by significant selling pressure. The current trend of short-term Bitcoin capitulation , as reported by CryptoQuant, offers a fascinating glimpse into the market’s underlying health. While it signals discomfort for some, it also highlights the critical interplay between supply and demand. The market’s ability to absorb these losses will ultimately dictate whether this phase leads to a robust rebound or prolonged consolidation. Staying informed and exercising prudence remain key in navigating these dynamic crypto waters. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What does “selling at a loss” mean for Bitcoin holders? Selling at a loss means that investors are selling their Bitcoin for a price lower than what they originally paid for it. This typically happens during periods of market downturns or high volatility. 2. Who are “short-term Bitcoin holders”? Short-term Bitcoin holders are generally defined as investors who have held their Bitcoin for a relatively brief period, often less than 155 days, according to on-chain analytics. 3. How does CryptoQuant identify Bitcoin capitulation? CryptoQuant utilizes various on-chain metrics and proprietary indicators, such as the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) or Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL), to identify periods where a significant portion of the market is selling at a loss, indicating capitulation. 4. Is Bitcoin capitulation always a sign of a market bottom? While historically, periods of significant Bitcoin capitulation have often preceded market bottoms, it is not a guaranteed signal. Other macroeconomic factors and market conditions also play a role. It should be used as one indicator among many. 5. What should investors do during a capitulation phase? During a capitulation phase, investors often consider several strategies, including observing market absorption, re-evaluating their long-term investment thesis, or exercising caution and waiting for clearer signals of a market reversal. Always conduct your own research and consider your risk tolerance. Did you find this analysis on Bitcoin capitulation insightful?

Consolidation Hints at Next Bull Run,https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-set-to-outperform-eth-consolidation-hints-at-next-bull-run/,"After a larger period of consolidation, Ripple’s XRP may be gearing up for a breakout against Ethereum (ETH), according to a leading analyst. He says that market structure and trading patterns show XRP’s prolonged consolidation period could soon yield to a powerful upward move, coinciding with a potential pause in ETH’s recent uptick. XRP’s Long Consolidation vs. ETH’s Cooling Momentum Market strategist CrediBULL Crypto noted on X earlier today that XRP’s price behavior has been a story of patience. The asset has traded above its highest monthly closing price for nine straight months, a period marked by sideways movement following earlier substantial rallies. This extended consolidation phase is a repeat of patterns observed historically in Bitcoin (BTC) and XRP itself before major price expansions. At the same time, CrediBULL revealed that the XRP/ETH trading pair has retreated to a key support zone, following a 700% pump earlier this year and a subsequent three-month correction. Often called a mid-range area, this level has historically acted as a springboard for renewed momentum. In contrast, Ethereum is approaching its own all-time high for the first time in this cycle after completing what CrediBULL described as a clear five-wave upward pattern originating from around $2,100. Such patterns usually come before periods of consolidation as markets absorb gains, implying that ETH’s recent rapid rise may be about to slow down. This, according to the analyst, sets up conditions for XRP to outperform ETH in the coming weeks. “When you put all this together, it suggests we are getting closer to the next period of outperformance on $XRP against $ETH,” he wrote. Price Action Signals Strength, But Risks Remain At the time of this writing, XRP was trading at $3.01, slightly up 0.1% in 24 hours but down 4.6% in the last seven days. Data from CoinGecko shows that it has oscillated between $2.95 and $3.10 in the past day, with broader weekly movement ranging from $2.96 to $3.34. Despite the pullback, XRP is still showing resilience in the current cycle, remaining up more than 430% year-on-year. Previously, chartist Ali Martinez had pointed to $2.80 as a make-or-break level for the world’s third-largest cryptocurrency. He highlighted the importance of this support, where over 1.7 million tokens were accumulated by large investors, a zone valued at more than $5 billion. XRP tested this floor earlier in the month during broader market stress, rebounding towards the $3.30 resistance. However, observers believe that decisively breaking past $3.26 could be the gateway for the Ripple token to challenge its recent ATH near $3.65. Additionally, CryptoPotato’s latest XRP assessment warned that if $2.80 fails, the asset could retreat toward $2.10. However, on the BTC pair, XRP has broken out of a multi-month downtrend, leaving both the 100-day and 200-day moving averages behind, signaling relative strength compared to Bitcoin.

Here’s What You Need to Know,https://cryptopotato.com/sei-set-for-40-surge-heres-what-you-need-to-know/,"TL;DR SEI price forms a triangle pattern, signaling breakout potential if $0.345 level is cleared soon. Active addresses up 83% in 3 months, crossing 1 million users amid rising ecosystem demand. Monaco launch adds institutional focus, offering sub-second trading speeds on a decentralized platform. Price Consolidation Sets the Stage SEI was trading around $0.32 at press time, after a 5% drop in the past 24 hours. Despite the decline, analysts are watching the price closely. On the 4-hour chart, SEI has been moving within a symmetrical triangle pattern. This formation, marked by lower highs and higher lows, often leads to strong directional moves. The token is trading just below the $0.33 level, which aligns with the 50% Fibonacci retracement. Analyst Ali Martinez pointed to $0.31 as a possible short-term dip level. Notably, this area is near the 0.382 Fibonacci line at $0.317. He added that a move above $0.35 could be the trigger for a breakout toward $0.44, which would represent a 40% gain from current prices. $SEI at $0.31 will be a buy-the-dip opportunity before an explosive breakout to $0.44! pic.twitter.com/ro5HcpG8qR — Ali (@ali_charts) August 18, 2025 New Infrastructure in Focus Sei Labs recently launched Monaco, a new protocol designed for institutional trading. Monaco runs on a Central Limit Order Book model and is built to support high-speed transactions. The Sei Network blog reports that it offers execution under one millisecond and settlement around 400 milliseconds. Gordon said , “SEI is building the infrastructure for a decentralized Wall Street,” describing Monaco as the first DeFi app directly incubated by Sei Labs. Another analyst, Byzantine General, noted that SEI “held up super well while the rest of the market dipped, ” following the announcement. Market Data Remains Steady Open interest in SEI futures is holding at stable levels. This suggests that traders remain engaged without adding high levels of leverage. Volume remains consistent after the early June breakout. Source: X Funding rates on Binance are currently at -0.012%. This shows short positioning is present, which may create pressure if the price begins to rise. Liquidations have stayed low, which often indicates a lack of panic in the market. User Activity on the Rise Daily activity on the Sei Network has grown steadily. Data from Artemis shows over 851,000 daily active addresses, which is a 22% rise in the past month. Over a three-month span, the number is up by 84%. Some days have crossed one million users. Source: Artemis Meanwhile, this growth reflects more users interacting with the network.

As the broader crypto market prepares for another bull run, established assets like XRP remain at the center of attention for investors seeking stability and upside. The explosive rise of new memecoin contenders, such as $LBRETT, is changing the dynamic for altcoin investors. XRP continues to benefit from its established reputation in the crypto space, but the emergence of innovative projects is prompting many to diversify. The buzz around Layer Brett and its potential for 150x gains is a testament to the market’s appetite for both utility and virality. Ripple’s evolving role and why XRP remains in focus When considering the XRP Price Prediction, several factors are at play. Ripple’s ongoing legal clarity, growing adoption in cross-border payments, and integration with smart contracts keep XRP relevant in conversations about the best long-term crypto assets. The token’s status as an ERC-20 token equivalent on some platforms and its integration with DeFi protocols have further solidified its position. XRP is still viewed as a top altcoin, with “XRP news” and “XRP forecast” trending among crypto enthusiasts. With transaction speeds rivaling many Layer 2 blockchain solutions, XRP appeals to those seeking fast, low gas fee crypto assets. As speculation increases about the next big crypto and trending cryptocurrencies, XRP continues to be a top gainer crypto in numerous market outlooks. However, even as the top meme coin and Layer 2 narratives heat up, XRP faces increased competition from fresh projects offering unique staking crypto incentives. Layer Brett: Where meme meets mechanism and scalability Layer Brett is not just another memecoin. Built as an Ethereum Layer 2 solution, it fuses meme token energy with real blockchain utility. The ongoing crypto presale offers $LBRETT at just $0.0044, making it a standout low cap crypto gem for early backers.

As a next big crypto and potential top meme coin, Layer Brett is purpose-built with transparent tokenomics (10 billion total supply, with 30% in presale) and plans for cross-chain compatibility. Its upcoming NFT and ecosystem upgrades keep the project at the forefront of innovation in trending cryptocurrencies. Why investors are shifting from XRP to LBRETT for outsized gains Despite the positive XRP Price Prediction, many investors are turning to LBRETT for its explosive upside potential. While XRP offers blue-chip stability and regulatory progress, Layer Brett provides the allure of a next 100x altcoin with Layer 2 blockchain efficiency, meme coin energy, and high-yield staking. The current crypto bull run 2025 narrative favors projects with low market caps, best meme coins status, and best crypto presale momentum. Layer Brett delivers on all fronts, challenging established players and positioning itself as the best crypto to buy now for those seeking both fun and function. Conclusion: Act now or miss the next top gainer crypto Layer Brett is still in its presale stages—but not for long.

In documents submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Aug. 15, Gemini revealed a $282.5 million net loss for the first half, an almost seven-fold increase from the $41.4 million shortfall a year earlier. Revenue fell to $67.9 million from $74.3 million. The filing puts Gemini, which plans to use the ticker ""GEMI"" on Nasdaq, in line to become the third crypto exchange to trade publicly in the U.S. after Coinbase (COIN), which debuted on Nasdaq in 2021, and Bullish (BLSH), the owner of CoinDesk, whose shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange a week ago. Ripple’s role in the listing stood out. In the filing, Gemini said it entered a credit agreement with Ripple Labs in July granting access to up to $75 million in loans, with the option to extend the facility to $150 million if certain metrics are met. Each drawdown must be at least $5 million and carries interest of either 6.5% or 8.5%, secured against collateral. In addition, once borrowing surpasses the initial $75 million, requests can be denominated in Ripple’s dollar-backed RLUSD stablecoin. As of the filing date, however, no borrowings had been drawn under the facility The credit deal with Gemini puts RLUSD directly in the mix as a settlement option for a major U.S. trading platform — an early indication that Ripple wants its stablecoin to compete alongside the two market leaders, Tether's USDT and USDC, issued by Circle Internet (CRCL).",Finance|Ripple|Gemini|IPOs|Crypto Exchanges|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS|TRADING|USDT,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-19 07:42:28

This retreat followed weeks of private talks with senior U.S. officials under President Donald Trump’s administration, according to the Financial Times . The British order, issued in January under the UK Investigatory Powers Act, tried to force Apple to give UK authorities access to customer data stored in iCloud. The order ran straight into the Trump White House’s wall, triggering a full-on pushback led by Vice President JD Vance and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. Vance confronted UK officials, Gabbard confirms deal While visiting the UK on vacation, Vance stepped in personally to block the enforcement of the order. A U.S. official said, “The vice-president negotiated a mutually beneficial understanding that the UK government will withdraw the current back-door order to Apple.” Vance, who’s repeatedly accused European nations of attacking American companies and limiting speech, saw the UK’s approach as one more example of overreach. Tulsi confirmed the reversal, saying the UK had “agreed to drop” its demand that Apple allow access to “the protected encrypted data of American citizens.” She told the Financial Times , “Over the past few months, I’ve been working closely with our partners in the UK, alongside President Trump and vice-president Vance, to ensure Americans’ private data remains private and our constitutional rights and civil liberties are protected.” Tulsi added, “I’m happy to share that the UK has agreed to drop its mandate for Apple to provide a ‘back door’ that would have enabled access to the protected encrypted data of American citizens and encroached on our civil liberties.” The situation, now described by one UK official as “settled,” hasn’t yet been closed on paper. The order has not been formally withdrawn, though three UK officials confirmed the matter is resolved. Another said London had “caved” to pressure from Trump’s team. A British official added bluntly, “We can’t and we won’t make Apple break its encryption.” Apple pulled service, filed legal complaint, and stayed silent As this dragged on, Apple didn’t just sit back. In February, the company yanked iCloud Advanced Data Protection from the UK. At the time, it said, “As we have said many times before, we have never built a back door or master key to any of our products or services and we never will.” The company also filed a legal challenge with the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, and the case is expected to go to court early next year. On Monday, Apple declined to comment. The original notice sent to Apple is still sealed under British law. Both sides are banned from speaking publicly about it. Still, the UK’s move sparked the biggest fight over encryption since the 2010s, throwing Apple’s no-backdoor stance straight into the political spotlight. Even though the UK pulled back, it’s unclear whether it’ll try again under different legal language. Someone close to Trump’s inner circle said doing that would break the agreement. “Any back door would weaken protections for U.S. citizens,” they said. The UK Investigatory Powers Act gives British law enforcement reach far beyond its borders. Technically, it lets them demand data from Apple even if the user is in the U.S. Critics call the law a “snooper’s charter.” UK authorities defend it as a tool to fight terrorism and child abuse. This latest reversal shows how much Prime Minister Keir Starmer is trying to stay aligned with the U.S., especially as he looks to dodge Trump’s economic retaliation and keep support flowing for Ukraine. The UK Home Office refused to confirm or deny the original notice, sticking to vague language. It pointed to the existing Data Access Agreement between the UK and U.S., which lets both governments request data from each other’s telecom companies, but with rules to stop either side from targeting the other’s citizens. “We will continue to build on those arrangements,” the Home Office said, “and we will also continue to take all actions necessary at the domestic level to keep UK citizens safe.” Get seen where it counts.

A recent analysis from crypto services provider Matrixport, shared on X, suggests that the future trajectory of Ethereum (ETH) is intricately linked to the sustained demand from treasury institutions and its ability to maintain a crucial support level. This insight is vital for anyone tracking the digital asset space. Is the Ethereum Rally Fueled by Institutional Investors? Matrixport’s assessment highlights that continued demand from treasury institutions is a cornerstone for the ongoing Ethereum rally . We’ve seen strong inflows into Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which indicates growing interest from larger, more traditional investment entities. However, it’s not all straightforward. Institutional Inflows: Significant capital has entered the ETH market through ETFs, signaling a bullish sentiment from big players. Muted Network Activity: Despite these inflows, the underlying network activity for Ethereum remains subdued. This presents a curious contrast that analysts are closely watching. Understanding this dynamic is key. While institutional money provides a strong foundation, the lack of organic network growth could pose challenges for a sustained upward trend. Why is the $4,180 Level Crucial for the Ethereum Rally? The report from Matrixport specifically pinpointed the $4,180 support level as a critical determinant for the Ethereum rally . Losing this price point could trigger further market unwinding, potentially leading to a significant price correction. Why is this particular level so important? Stablecoin Dominance: A vast majority of stablecoins are issued on the Ethereum blockchain. This makes Ethereum the backbone for a significant portion of the crypto economy. Future Issuance Expectations: There are high expectations for further stablecoin issuance, which naturally ties into Ethereum’s utility and demand. If Ethereum fails to hold $4,180, it could signal a loss of confidence, leading to selling pressure and potentially impacting the broader stablecoin ecosystem built upon it. This makes the level not just a technical indicator, but a psychological one for the market. Navigating Challenges and Opportunities for the Ethereum Rally The path forward for the Ethereum rally involves navigating both promising opportunities and potential challenges. While institutional adoption through ETFs is a strong positive, the muted network activity warrants closer examination. What does this mean for investors? Monitor Institutional Flow: Keep an eye on reports regarding institutional inflows into ETH ETFs. Continued demand here is a green light. Watch Key Support: The $4,180 level is a non-negotiable watch point. A break below it could signal caution. Assess Network Growth: Look for signs of increasing network activity, such as higher transaction volumes or new decentralized application (dApp) usage, which would provide more fundamental support for the rally. The interplay between institutional interest, technical price levels, and fundamental network health will ultimately dictate the strength and longevity of Ethereum’s upward momentum. To understand more about general market trends, you might read our recent analysis on crypto market dynamics . In conclusion, the current Ethereum rally is at a pivotal juncture. Its sustained growth appears to be heavily reliant on the consistent backing of treasury institutions and its ability to defend critical support levels like $4,180. While strong ETF inflows are encouraging, the subdued network activity serves as a reminder that fundamental health is also key. Investors should remain vigilant, observing both institutional movements and key technical indicators to make informed decisions in this dynamic market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the main factor influencing the Ethereum rally? The main factor influencing the Ethereum rally, according to Matrixport, is the continued demand from treasury institutions, coupled with its ability to hold key support levels. Who are “Treasury institutions” in this context? In this context, “treasury institutions” refer to large institutional investors, investment funds, and corporate treasuries that are allocating capital into digital assets like Ethereum, often through vehicles like ETFs. Why is the $4,180 level important for Ethereum? The $4,180 level is important because it represents a critical support point. If Ethereum loses this level, it could trigger further unwinding and significant price corrections, impacting market confidence. What does “muted network activity” mean for ETH? “Muted network activity” for ETH means that despite strong investment inflows, the underlying usage of the Ethereum blockchain (e.g., number of transactions, active addresses, dApp usage) is not increasing significantly, which could indicate a lack of organic growth. How do stablecoins impact the Ethereum rally? Stablecoins significantly impact the Ethereum rally because most of them are issued on the Ethereum blockchain. High expectations for further stablecoin issuance tie directly into Ethereum’s utility and demand, making its underlying infrastructure crucial for the broader crypto economy.

That kind of run is rare, but occasionally, a project comes along that sparks whispers of “the next Solana.” That talk is circling Little Pepe (LILPEPE), a meme-powered Layer 2 project currently in presale and trading well under $0.003. With a growing community, real technical backbone, and big-name exchange listings lined up, some investors think this little frog could leap further than most expect. LILPEPE’s Current Price and Presale Momentum As of writing, LILPEPE is in Stage 10 of its presale at $0.0019 per token, with over $18.17 million raised out of its $19.32 million target. Over 12.14 billion tokens have already been sold—around 95% of the stage allocation. The token will list at $0.003, meaning presale buyers are looking at a near 60% bump before it even hits the open market. The presale has been fast-moving, with each stage selling out quickly. Early stages saw prices as low as $0.0014, rewarding early entrants with paper gains before launch day. This speed isn’t just hype—it’s a sign of strong buy-side interest from both retail and whales. On-chain data shows heavy accumulation from big wallets, a bullish signal heading into listing. The Solana Comparison Why are some comparing this meme token to Solana’s legendary 2021 run? Solana’s success wasn’t just hype—it delivered real utility with high-speed, low-cost transactions, carving out a space as a scalable smart contract platform. LILPEPE is taking a similar approach but with a twist—building a Layer 2 blockchain tuned for meme culture. The team isn’t just launching a token; they’re creating an Ethereum-compatible network with ultra-fast settlement, rock-bottom fees, and focusing on NFTs, micro-transactions, and meme-based applications. More Than Just a Meme Coin The crypto market is littered with meme coins that spike and fade. LILPEPE is positioning itself differently. Alongside the culture and humor, there’s an infrastructure play here: Layer 2 Technology – Scales Ethereum while keeping gas fees near zero. Zero Tax Trading – No buy or sell taxes, making it attractive for active traders. Anti-Rug Safeguards – Sniper-bot resistance and security measures. Staking & DAO Governance – Long-term holders can earn rewards and vote on ecosystem decisions. Meme Launchpad – A hub for launching new meme tokens and dApps on the LILPEPE chain. This utility and brand identity mix separates LILPEPE from your average frog-themed coin.Youtube Embed $100 in LILPEPE Could Turn Into $20,000?? Best Meme Coin investment of 2025?? Exchange Listings, Audit & CMC Presence Another green flag—LILPEPE has already been listed on CoinMarketCap, giving it visibility to millions of traders before launch. The project has also passed a smart contract audit, easing concerns for investors wary of rug pulls—a common risk in the meme coin space. Confirmed Tier-1 exchange listings are in the pipeline, boosting liquidity and exposure when trading opens. The post-launch rally could be significant if those listings coincide with a strong marketing blitz. $777K Giveaway Fueling Hype To keep momentum high, the team is running a $777,000 giveaway. Ten winners will each receive $77,000 worth of LILPEPE tokens. Over 208,000 entries have already been recorded, and to qualify, investors simply need to contribute a minimum of $100 in the presale and complete promotional tasks. This campaign is designed to expand reach and bring in thousands of new holders before launch. Could It Hit $0.75? A move from $0.003 to $0.75 would be a 250× jump. Sounds extreme—but let’s remember, Solana did over 100× in under a year. Here’s what would need to happen: Strong post-listing rally on hype and early liquidity. Rapid adoption of the LILPEPE Layer 2 by meme creators and NFT projects. Sustained narrative—positioning LILPEPE as the “meme infrastructure standard” rather than just another seasonal token. If the Layer 2 gains traction and the community keeps expanding, triple-digit multiples aren’t impossible—especially in the current meme coin revival. Of course, it is still high-risk and speculative, but that is frequently where the largest profits are made. Final Thoughts As of writing, LILPEPE is under $0.002 with its almost sold-out presale, a completed smart audit, and visibility on CoinMarketCap. It has the infrastructure, community hype, and marketing push to potentially deliver outsized returns—similar to how Solana rewarded its earliest backers. For investors hunting for the next big breakout, LILPEPE offers a rare mix of culture and technology in the meme coin space. With launch just around the corner and a $777K giveaway adding extra fuel, this little frog might make a giant leap. If you’ve been waiting for your “early Solana moment,” this might be the pond to watch closely.

Ethereum Failed To Breach +1 SD Of Active Realized Price As explained by on-chain analytics firm Glassnode in a new post on X, the ETH rally stumbled after the asset’s price hit a level of a historically relevant pricing model. The model in question is the “Active Realized Price,” which, in short, tells us about the cost basis of the average investor or address on the Ethereum network. This indicator differs from the usual Realized Price in that it excludes the inactive or lost supply from its data. Related Reading: XRP Dips Under $3: Analyst Warns $2.6 Or Even $2 Could Be Next Now, here is the chart shared by Glassnode that shows the trend in the model, as well as its +1 standard deviation (SD) level, over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, Ethereum has recently been trading above the Active Realized Price, indicating that the average holder of the asset has been sitting on some net unrealized profit. The recent price rally took the cryptocurrency far above this metric and in fact resulted in a retest of the +1 SD level. From the chart, it’s visible that this level is currently situated around $4,700. This is around where the asset topped out last week, before starting on a drawdown of around 10%. Thus, it would appear that the threshold may have played the role of resistance. According to the analytics firm, this isn’t anything unusual, as the line has repeatedly acted as a barrier in past cycles. The explanation behind this trend may lie in the fact that this level is around where investor profits become significant enough for mass selloffs with the motive of profit-taking become likely to occur. In the current cycle so far, Ethereum has been able to breach the line once, back in March 2024. This break lasted only briefly, however, suggesting the selling pressure was again a big obstacle to the bullish momentum. Related Reading: Institutions Buying The Bitcoin Dip? Coinbase Premium Shoots Up In some other news, last week was the strongest for the Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) since their launch in the US, as Glassnode has pointed out in another X post. As is visible in the above chart, the US Ethereum spot ETFs saw a massive green netflow spike last week, with 649,000 tokens of the asset entering into the wallets associated with these funds. The coin’s rally to the top above $4,700 occurred as these inflows took place. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is floating around $4,360, up 2% over the last week.

South Korean crypto exchange Upbit, a powerhouse in the Asian market, has just announced a significant expansion to its offerings. The exchange will introduce new API3 trading pairs, specifically API3/KRW and API3/USDT spot trading, set to launch on August 19 at 08:00 UTC. This highly anticipated move is generating considerable buzz and marks a pivotal moment for the API3 project and the broader decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. It promises to unlock new opportunities for traders and enhance the token’s global reach. What Exactly is API3, and Why is Upbit’s Listing So Crucial for API3 Trading? API3 stands out in the blockchain space by focusing on decentralized APIs, known as dAPIs. Its core mission is to enable smart contracts to securely and reliably connect with real-world data and services. Unlike many traditional oracle solutions that rely on third-party intermediaries, API3 champions a “first-party oracle” approach. This means API providers directly operate their own oracle nodes, offering greater transparency and reducing potential points of failure. This direct integration method strengthens the integrity and trustworthiness of data feeds for decentralized applications (dApps), which is vital for sectors like DeFi, gaming, and supply chain management. Upbit’s decision to list API3 trading pairs carries immense weight. As one of the largest and most influential cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea, Upbit commands a significant share of the crypto market in a region known for its high adoption rates. This listing serves as a strong validation of API3’s technology and its long-term potential. It dramatically increases API3’s exposure to a vast new audience of traders, especially those looking to trade with the Korean Won (KRW), thereby enhancing the project’s global footprint. What Does Upbit’s API3 Trading Listing Mean for You as a Trader? The introduction of API3/KRW and API3/USDT pairs on Upbit brings several compelling benefits and considerations for active traders and long-term holders alike: Enhanced Liquidity: A major exchange like Upbit facilitating API3 trading typically leads to a significant boost in overall token liquidity. Higher liquidity means easier execution of trades, potentially with tighter bid-ask spreads, making it more efficient to enter or exit positions. Broader Market Access: For the first time, Korean investors gain direct, seamless access to API3 using their national currency, KRW. This removes conversion hurdles and can attract a substantial influx of new capital and participants into the API3 ecosystem, diversifying its investor base. Improved Price Discovery: Increased trading volume and a wider participant base often result in more efficient price discovery. This means the market price of API3 is more likely to accurately reflect its true valuation based on supply and demand dynamics. Boosted Visibility and Adoption: Listings on prominent exchanges like Upbit are powerful marketing tools. They elevate a project’s profile, attracting not only more traders but also potential developers and businesses interested in building on or integrating with the API3 network. Potential for Growth: Expanded access and increased awareness can fuel demand, potentially contributing to the token’s growth trajectory as more users recognize its utility and potential. However, it is crucial for traders to approach new listings with a balanced perspective. While opportunities abound, new listings can sometimes lead to increased price volatility as the market adjusts to the new supply and demand dynamics. Always be prepared for potential price swings. Navigating New API3 Trading Opportunities: What Should You Consider? As the August 19 launch date approaches, preparing your strategy is paramount. It is essential to conduct thorough due diligence on API3’s fundamentals, its underlying technology, and its long-term roadmap. Understanding the project’s utility in the decentralized application space, such as its role in providing reliable data for DeFi protocols or blockchain gaming, can offer invaluable insights into its potential. Always assess your personal risk tolerance before committing to any new asset trading, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Furthermore, staying informed about broader crypto market sentiment and macroeconomic trends will be beneficial. While the Upbit listing is undeniably a positive development for API3 trading , external market conditions can shift rapidly. Diversifying your portfolio and implementing sound risk management strategies, such as setting stop-loss orders, can help mitigate potential downsides. A well-informed and cautious approach to your API3 trading decisions will always serve you best. In conclusion, Upbit’s strategic decision to add API3/KRW and API3/USDT spot pairs marks a truly significant milestone for the API3 project. This move promises enhanced liquidity, broader market access, and increased global visibility for this innovative decentralized API solution. For crypto enthusiasts and traders alike, this presents a fresh and compelling opportunity to engage with API3. Remember to always trade responsibly, conduct your own research, and stay informed about market dynamics. The future of decentralized data just got a significant boost! Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: When will API3 trading begin on Upbit? API3 trading will commence on Upbit on August 19 at 08:00 UTC. Q2: What are the new API3 trading pairs available on Upbit? Upbit will list API3/KRW and API3/USDT spot trading pairs. Q3: Why is Upbit listing API3 significant for the project?

Q4: What should traders consider before engaging in API3 trading on Upbit? Traders should conduct thorough research on API3’s fundamentals, understand its technology, and assess their personal risk tolerance. Monitoring market sentiment and employing risk management strategies are also crucial. Q5: What makes API3’s approach to oracles unique? API3 utilizes a “first-party oracle” approach, where API providers directly run their own oracle nodes.

The lending ban aims to protect retail investors from risky practices. South Korean exchanges picked up the trend from DeFi protocols, where Aave became the leader and revived the inflow of liquidity. Just days before regulators moved in with a direct halt to lending, Bithumb slashed its leverage by half, only offering 2X collateralized loans. The exchange plans to build an independent lending platform in the future. Bithumb voluntarily reduced its lending leverage, according to South Korean media . In August, regulators were already deliberating on the issue of lending regulation, though with no immediate ban. South Korean exchanges offered risky leveraged crypto loans South Korean exchanges picked up activity in 2025, with more retail buyers seeking the hottest coins. Since July, local crypto exchanges like Upbit have allowed significant unregulated lending. Leveraged lending was also the biggest problem, leading to potential liquidations and losses, as well as anomalies when using stablecoins. Users could borrow against up to 80% of the value of their BTC, XRP, or USDT holdings. Bithumb also offered riskier loans of up to four times the collateral. This risky source of liquidity could lead to unwinding and liquidations in the case of a bear market. The rapid rise of lending services alarmed regulators, who moved in with new compliance requests. Since the launch of exchange-based lending, retail borrowed the equivalent of $1.1B in one month, spread across 27,600 accounts. Around 13% of loans were liquidated in price swings. After the new halt comes into force, legacy loans will continue until repaid, but exchanges are banned from new lending. Lending may resume once the regulator sets up new guidelines and safety features. South Korea has attempted to build formal crypto regulations, to prepare for spot ETFs. Local banks are also meeting to prepare for eventual stablecoin regulation, as Cryptopolitan recently reported . South Korea spreads influence through selected assets The South Korean market boosts selected coins and tokens. XRP is among the assets with significant legacy representation on South Korean exchanges. Around 13.97% of XRP volumes are against the South Korean loans. Legacy meme tokens and altcoins also depend on South Korean exchanges. For Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), the share of the Korean Won is up to 18.8%, leading to outsized price rallies. South Korean exchanges remain relatively conservative with their listings, often offering chances for coins and memes to make a return after years on international markets. These exchanges have stricter requirements for liquidity and market longevity before adding assets. For blue-chip trading, the Korean won is less relevant, with a small share of BTC and ETH activity. The Korean won premium is also relatively smaller. The introduction of local stablecoins may further displace the fiat currency as a source of liquidity. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

50325869,559406,1755590442,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50325869.jpeg,South Korea Set To Unveil New Stablecoins Framework In October,https://bitcoinist.com/south-korea-set-to-unveil-new-stablecoins-framework/,"South Korea’s financial authority is expected to release the long-awaited regulatory framework next quarter, offering clear guidelines for the issuance and distribution of won-pegged stablecoins. Stablecoin Guidelines By October On Monday, local news media outlets reported that South Korea’s financial regulator, the Financial Services Commission (FSC), is expected to release a bill for a stablecoin pegged to the Korean won (KRW) within two months. According to MoneyToday, a member of the Democratic Party of Korea (DPK), Park Min-kyu, confirmed that he had “recently received a report from the FSC on the direction of stablecoins,” affirming, “The government’s bill is expected to be submitted to the National Assembly around October.” The bill is anticipated to be included in the second phase of the Virtual Asset User Protection Act. Notably, the FSC has been working to develop digital assets legislation and shift its regulatory approach for over a year, establishing the Virtual Asset Committee in November to prepare the next phase of its plan and finalize it by the second half of 2025. The second phase of the Virtual Asset User Protection Act includes regulations on the distribution of digital assets and stablecoins, continuing its efforts to align with global standards. The FSC’s Vice Chairman Kim So-young previously stated that the Korean government was “speeding up efforts” to develop the Korean crypto market while protecting users. Attention will be focused on the content of the rules, the report affirmed, as the FSC plans to unveil a regulatory framework outlining requirements for issuing won-pegged stablecoins, collateral management, and internal control systems, which have been a concern among both the crypto and banking industries. The FSC’s Secretary-General warned in January that the regulator needed to address listing standards, how to deal with stablecoins, and how to create rules for the behavior of virtual asset exchanges. Meanwhile, the banking sector has been studying two legalization scenarios, since it remains unclear whether non-bank entities will be allowed to be stablecoin issuers. Financial institutions have also been considering a business model in which banks establish a joint venture to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins’ Momentum In South Korea As the new media outlet noted, institutionalization of won-pegged stablecoins has gained significant attention after President Lee Jae-myung pledged it during his presidential campaign. The electoral promise, which also vowed to address the status of crypto-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs), followed the US’s regulatory shift under the Trump administration and its push for USD-pegged stablecoins, which currently lead the sector. Previously, the chairman of the South Korea Stock Exchange, Jeong Eun-bo, urged authorities to institutionalize crypto in the country, noting that the Korean market needs to be revitalized to compete with other nations and prevent falling behind international markets. Over the past two months, multiple bills related to the issuance and distribution of KRW-pegged stablecoins have been introduced in South Korea’s National Assembly. As reported by Bitcoinist, Korea’s ruling and opposition parties proposed rival bills in July to establish the highly anticipated regulatory framework for digital assets pegged to the Korean won. Member of the Planning and Finance Committee from the Democratic Party, Ahn Do-gil, introduced the “Act on the Issuance and Distribution of Value-Stable Digital Assets,” while member of the Land, Infrastructure, and Transport Committee from the People Power Party (PPP), Kim Eun-hye, proposed the “Act on Payment Innovation Using Value-Fixed Digital Assets.” Both bills share several similarities, including the assignment of stablecoin oversight to the Financial Services Commission (FSC). However, the two proposed legislation differ in the issue of interest payments, with the PPP’s bill allowing interest payments and the DPK’s bill completely banning interest payments to prevent market disruption. Min Byung-deok, a member of the National Assembly’s Government Committee, also introduced the “Digital Assets Basic Act” in June, which proposes allowing the issuance of won-pegged stablecoins and establishing a Digital Asset Committee under the direct authority of the president. Amid the global push for stablecoins, Korean individuals investing in overseas stocks have reportedly shifted from US big tech equities to crypto-linked stocks, with a focus on stablecoin-related companies throughout July, suggesting growing interest in the sector.",Crypto News|Banking Sector|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Crypto legislation|South Korea and Crypto|South korea stablecoins|stablecoin bill|Stablecoin Legislation|Stablecoins|Trump administration,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ASIA|MARKET|REGULATION|BTC,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-19 08:00:42

Upbit Announces New Altcoin Listing! Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/listing-news-continues-on-south-korean-exchanges-upbit-announces-new-altcoin-listing-here-are-the-details/,"South Korea-based cryptocurrency exchange Upbit announced that it will open the altcoin API3 for trading in KRW and USDT pairs on August 19, 2025. Upbit to List API3 on KRW and USDT Markets According to the official statement, API3 will only support deposits and withdrawals via the Ethereum network. If users transfer funds via the wrong network, the process for refunding their assets may take longer. Transactions will begin at 5:00 PM on August 19th. The exchange also announced that API3's last closing price on the BTC market was 0.00000741 BTC, equivalent to approximately 1,197 KRW or 0.8605 USDT. Upbit will implement certain restrictions to maintain price stability during the market launch phase. Buy orders will be restricted during the first five minutes of trading, and sell orders will not be allowed for prices 10% below the previous closing price. Only limit orders will be valid for the first two hours. API3 is a project that aims to develop a decentralized API (Application Programming Interface) for Web 3.0. While traditional API services are typically provided through centralized platforms, API3 aligns this system with blockchain technology. This aims to provide dApps with secure and cost-effective access to real-world data without the need for centralized intermediaries. According to experts, API3's listing on Upbit will both give the project visibility in the Korean market and increase interest in Web3-focused infrastructure projects. *This is not investment advice.

While both still carry cultural weight, a quiet transition is underway: Remittix is gaining traction for its real-world functionality, strong roadmap, and great potential. Dogecoin Faces Stagnation Despite Meme Legacy Dogecoin retains community support but is showing signs of wear. Price action indicates persistent resistance near $0.25, and sentiment fatigue is growing among traders. Recent indicators point to limited upside: DOGE gained around 8%, yet remains well below its former highs. Investors appear to be waiting for fresh catalysts, especially as the meme narrative loses steam. Shiba Inu Price Falters Amid Continuing Downtrend SHIB Price has dropped nearly 9.4% this past week and currently trades around $0.00001273, signaling weak momentum. Looking back six months, Shiba lost over 58%, showing that short-term rallies cannot mask a broader decline. Although it still sits within the meme coin top 20, investor interest is dwindling in the absence of fresh developments. Remittix Gains Ground with Utility and Momentum Remittix has vaulted ahead by focusing on substance over hype. It’s building real offerings, like PayFi tools, staking mechanisms, and a mobile wallet, and delivering them on schedule, drawing investor attention. It has hit the $20 million fundraising milestone, trading at $0.0969, with 608 million tokens sold. With a confirmed BitMart listing triggered at the $20M milestone, Remittix is capturing headlines. Its community giveaway and Q3 wallet beta are further boosting buzz. Remittix delivers PayFi tools that most retail users can use: Tackles the $19 trillion global payments industry Practical PayFi use cases versus speculative hype Active in over 30 countries with fiat settlement support Secured by a CertiK audit, building trust for users Whale activity surges ahead of listing and wider adoption Analysts now list Remittix as a serious 100× altcoin contender in 2025, not rooted in meme hype, but in infrastructure and product delivery. Shifting Investor Priorities from Hype to Infrastructure Dogecoin and Shiba Inu may still evoke nostalgia, but their price trends and social signals are waning. In contrast, Remittix’s real-use case architecture, bank transfers, staking, audits, and wallets, is turning heads.

The Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) has made a notable move, substantially increasing its RBC crypto investment . This development highlights a growing trend among major financial institutions embracing digital assets. It’s a clear signal of evolving perspectives on the future of finance. Royal Bank of Canada’s Astounding 16% Surge in Bitcoin Holdings In a move that has captured attention, the Royal Bank of Canada significantly boosted its holdings in Strategy shares. During the second quarter, RBC’s stake rose by approximately 16%. This increase took their total shares from 162,909 in the first quarter to an impressive 188,657. Crypto Briefing first reported this notable increase. Strategy is not just any company; it operates as a Bitcoin treasury firm. Additionally, it offers crucial business intelligence solutions. This makes RBC’s increased exposure particularly interesting, as it directly ties into the burgeoning digital asset space. Why is RBC Boosting its Crypto Investment? This recent surge in holdings isn’t an isolated event. Earlier this year, the Royal Bank of Canada openly expressed a sharpened focus on the cryptocurrency sector. Their reasoning was straightforward: they anticipated substantial growth in both Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) and deal-making within the crypto industry. RBC’s strategy reflects a broader institutional recognition of crypto’s potential. Banks are now actively exploring ways to integrate digital assets into their portfolios and services. This proactive approach by a major player like RBC underscores a shift from skepticism to strategic engagement. What Does This RBC Crypto Investment Mean for the Market? The decision by the Royal Bank of Canada to expand its RBC crypto investment in a Bitcoin treasury company sends a powerful message. It signals increasing institutional confidence in Bitcoin and the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem. Such moves can lend significant legitimacy to digital assets in the eyes of mainstream investors. Consider these key implications: Validation: Large banks investing directly validates the long-term viability of cryptocurrencies. Liquidity: Increased institutional participation can enhance market liquidity and stability. Precedent: RBC’s actions might encourage other traditional financial institutions to follow suit. This trend suggests that digital assets are moving from niche investments to integral components of diversified portfolios. The focus is shifting towards regulated and compliant ways for institutions to gain exposure. Navigating the Future of Finance with Digital Assets The Royal Bank of Canada’s strategic increase in Strategy shares is more than just a financial transaction. It represents a forward-looking perspective on the financial landscape. As traditional finance converges with the digital asset world, institutions like RBC are positioning themselves for future growth. This engagement also highlights the growing demand for specialized solutions like those offered by Bitcoin treasury companies. Businesses are increasingly looking for secure and efficient ways to manage their digital asset holdings. The Royal Bank of Canada’s move supports this evolving ecosystem, indicating a mature market. The journey into crypto for traditional banks involves careful navigation of regulatory frameworks and market volatility. However, the potential rewards, as identified by RBC, appear to outweigh the challenges. Their strategic RBC crypto investment is a testament to this evolving outlook. In conclusion, the Royal Bank of Canada’s substantial 16% increase in Strategy holdings marks a significant milestone. It underscores a clear strategic pivot towards digital assets, driven by anticipated growth in the crypto sector. This bold RBC crypto investment not only validates the importance of Bitcoin treasury solutions but also sets a precedent for broader institutional adoption. As major financial players continue to embrace this space, the future of finance looks increasingly digital.

This range-bound behavior reflects a period of market indecision. Notably, a red flag is flashing on the weekly charts because of the emergence of a bearish divergence. XRP is pushing higher highs while the relative strength index (RSI) slips into lower highs, a textbook warning that bullish momentum is weakening. Why This Setup Matters This isn’t the first time XRP has exhibited such a divergence. The last occurrence, back in late 2020, preceded a notable pullback, as XRP ultimately surrendered a significant portion of its gains in the months that followed. While history doesn’t guarantee repetition, the parallel is too striking to ignore. Today’s chart also paints a similar story since analysts are highlighting resistance forming in the upper range near $3.26–$3.40, and strong support around $2.90–$3.00. Market commentator Justcryptopays noted that XRP is eyeing the $3.13–$3.17 resistance zone. A decisive breakout above $3.17 could ignite the next rally toward $3.40. A breakdown below that support could open the door to deeper losses, potentially toward the $2.75, $2.55–$2.62 zones. DavidTheBuilder pointed out, “In the short term, XRP may consolidate between $3.00–$3.20 until a clearer breakout emerges. A move above $3.40 would confirm bullish continuation, while losing $2.90 could open the door to deeper downside toward $2.75 or even $2.55.” Renowned market analyst EGRAG CRYPTO shared similar sentiments that a full-body 4H candle close below $2.90 could confirm a 5-wave structure, opening downside toward $2.65. On the upside, $3.65 remains the key breakout level to watch. At the time of this writing, XRP was trading at $3.00, according to CoinGecko data . Conclusion XRP is consolidating within a tight $2.90–$3.40 range, but the weekly chart flashes a bearish divergence, higher highs in price against lower highs in RSI, signaling fading momentum. A similar setup in late 2020 preceded a major pullback. Immediate resistance sits at $3.35–$3.40, while $2.90–$3.00 remains critical support since a breakdown could accelerate losses toward $2.75–$2.62. Although a breakout above resistance could shift sentiment bullish, the current structure leans bearish, urging traders to proceed with caution.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-19 08:10:50

A new contender, Little Pepe (LILPEPE), is poised to potentially mirror these gains. Currently trading below $0.003, LILPEPE combines meme appeal with robust blockchain technology, aiming to capture the hearts and wallets of investors. The Launch and Trajectory of Little Pepe The LILPEPE token presale has generated significant buzz, raising an impressive $18.17 million, which is near its $19.32 million goal. Currently, in its final stages, the token price stands at $0.0019. This rapid accumulation, driven by both individual investors and large-scale buyers, suggests a strong market reception upon its upcoming listing. Beyond a Meme: Technical and Utility Aspects of Little Pepe LILPEPE is not just another meme coin; it's a Layer 2 solution enhancing Ethereum's scalability with minimal transaction fees and a focus on meme-based applications and NFTs. Its infrastructure is solid, designed to support rapid transactions and a growing ecosystem of decentralized applications. Core Features Sniper-bot resistant and zero tax on trades, making it attractive for frequent trading. Robust staking options and decentralized governance through its DAO. An innovative meme token launchpad that could potentially revolutionize how meme projects kick off. Market Potential and Financial Projections Discussion around LILPEPE has drawn comparisons to Solana's meteoric rise, speculating on a similar explosive growth potential. From its current price, a surge to $0.75 represents a substantial increase, reminiscent of Solana's journey from a few dollars to over $200. Such growth hinges on the successful adoption of its Layer 2 technology and the expansion of its user base and project engagements. Strategic Market Movements and Future Listings Pre-listing activities have been optimistic, with LILPEPE securing a spot on CoinMarketCap and undergoing a successful smart contract audit. These developments, coupled with anticipated Tier-1 exchange listings, suggest a robust post-launch performance. Community Engagement and Promotional Strategies The $777,000 giveaway by LILPEPE has attracted over 208,000 participants, creating a vibrant community eager for the token's full launch. This type of engagement is crucial for maintaining momentum and building a loyal user base. Conclusion: Is LILPEPE the Next Big Thing? LILPEPE seems set on a path that could replicate or even surpass early success stories like Solana, especially with its unique positioning in the meme coin market and solid technological foundation. For crypto enthusiasts and investors looking for the next big opportunity, LILPEPE offers a compelling case.

Play-to-earn relied on complicated tokenomics (often inflationary), with gameplay driven largely by luck. And if you really wanted to earn more, the easiest way was by bot-powered reward farming. As a result, the GameFi sector hasn’t really gotten off the ground, mired in crappy gameplay and poor mechanics. But Tapzi ($TAPZI) could change everything, finally fulfilling GameFi’s promise. GameFi Sector Outlook: Stormy, But Rays of Light Activity in blockchain gaming has softened in recent months. DappRadar’s Q2 2025 snapshot shows daily unique active wallets (dUAW) across Web3 at 24.3M (down 2.5% quarter-over-quarter), with gaming’s share at 20% and gaming-specific dUAW down 17% quarter-over-quarter to 4.8M. Steep year-over-year funding declines and a wave of game shutdowns have been tied to weak retention and unsustainable tokenomics. But these negative stats might just be the calm before the storm. So far, the GameFi industry has stagnated due to poor games – not because of any problem with the underlying concept. And there are bright spots in the sector, too, such as the Notcoin phenomenon on TON . It pushed wallet growth and popularized simple tap-to-earn mechanics – evidence that straightforward loops and social distribution can still succeed. Another positive sign? Traditional publishers are testing on-chain features: Ubisoft rolls out Might & Magic: Fates with Immutable , and Immutable has opened ‘Immutable Play’ to Web2 studios to add on-chain rewards. Sega launched KAI: Battle of Three Kingdoms in April on the Oasys blockchain Netmarble continues to push a 2025 roadmap with seven Immutable-based blockchain games Fifa, Mythical Games, and even Cirque du Soleil are getting into Web3 games. Coming at a time when the broader market is down, these moves underscore a shift toward optional, utility-led blockchain layers rather than token-first design. And blockchain-first architecture is exactly what Tapzi offers. Tapzi: Gaming Platform and Skill-Based Winners Aware of the weaknesses of the Web3 gaming world, Tapzi sets out to solve them. One of the best crypto presales and best meme coins of 2025, Tapzi offers gasless, bot-free matches that let players stake tokens in live duels of chess, checkers, tic-tac-toe and rock-paper-scissors. The winner takes the pot, pure and simple. Tapzi’s core loop is simple: before a match of chess, checkers, rock-paper-scissors or tic-tac-toe, both players stake $TAPZI; the winner takes the prize pool. Matches are gasless (not as fees), so micro-stakes aren’t eaten by fees and are played live against human opponents (no bots). The whitepaper calls for on-chain result storage, replays and cryptographic timestamps for dispute resolution. The aim is to reward time and talent, not random number generators or loot-box dynamics. Tapzi’s not waiting around, either – a demo is already live, with gasless, real-time multiplayer and anti-bot measures to keep outcomes decided by gameplay rather than randomness or emissions. Tapzi is a platform, not just a single game. SDKs and smart-contract tools are planned so outside developers can launch skill-based titles on Tapzi’s arcade, set custom rules, and route staking-based rewards to players. That approach aligns with the sector’s tilt toward infrastructure. While simple, classic games ironically provide more reliable gameplay than many more ‘advanced’ GameFi concepts. Tapzi ($TAPZI): Future-Ready Architecture to Rejuvenate Blockchain Gaming Hold $TAPZI to enter matches, join ranked events and purchase upgrades, thereby creating in-game demand. Prize pools are player-funded (winner takes the opponent’s stake), with no additional emissions. The total supply is 5B tokens: 20% presale, 20% liquidity, 15% locked treasury, 10% for airdrops, development, marketing, and the team behind the project. An additional 5% goes towards user rewards. By delivering gasless, bot-resistant matches and verifiable results, Tapzi could ride current currents in Web3 gaming. Smaller, instantly playable loops, real stakes, and platform-first distribution drive a smooth, practiced feel to the project, in contrast to clunky interfaces of other projects. Tapzi arrives just as GameFi investors are looking for the best crypto to buy – and they’re looking for quality projects. That could explain why the presale is off to a roaring start, with tokens priced at $0.0035, with an expected listing price of $0.009. Purchase tokens with wallets like Best Wallet ; crypto accepted includes $ETH, $BNB, $MATIC, $SOL, $TRX and card payments. Tapzi Launches at Perfect Time, Takes GameFi by Storm Tapzi enters a tougher, more discerning market where metrics and retention matter more than token hype. That’s perfect – Tapzi delivers the gaming experience and platform the market is looking for. Do your own research first, of course.

Ark Invest’s Continued Interest in Robinhood Cathie Wood’s ARK has been seeking long-term capital growth from global players that benefit from disruptive innovation. Robinhood, for instance, saw a soaring customer base of 26.5 million in July, a significant increase from the previous month. Besides, Robinhood’s crypto revenue jumped 98% to $160 million, fuelled by higher trading volumes. Robinhood also timed the Bitstamp acquisition well, at a time when Bitcoin adoption is rapidly spreading through institutions globally. Additionally, the firm expanded its product range, launching USDG, a fully regulated stablecoin in the EU. Per Yahoo Finance data , Robinhood stock closed at $115.02 on Monday, a 0.74 % increase. Further, the stock has gained 4.81% since last month and 208.70% year-to-date. Did ARK Sell Robinhood Shares Before? As reported earlier, Cathie Wood’s investment vehicle sold $5.8 million of Robinhood shares last month, along with $6.5 million worth of Coinbase Global shares. The rally in stock sales followed as Bitcoin rose to new all-time highs, hitting $118,080, in early July. Later, the world’s largest crypto soared above $124.4K. Meanwhile, Robinhood is facing scrutiny in the US, as Florida’s attorney general opened an investigation into its crypto division, claiming that it marketed itself as the “least expensive way to purchase crypto.” The post Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest Scoops $14M Worth of Robinhood Shares appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|ARK Invest|Cathie Wood|Robinhood,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BUSINESS|TRADING|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-08-19 08:18:15
50329563,https://invezz.com/?p=2843035,1755595043,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"The new Wall Street: bringing investments on-chain with Hong Yea, Grvt CEO",https://invezz.com/news/2025/08/19/the-new-wall-street-bringing-investments-on-chain-with-hong-yea-grvt-ceo/,"Hong Yea’s transition from a decade-long career on Wall Street to founding Grvt in May 2022 (which happened just weeks before a major crypto market crash) reflects his strong belief in blockchain’s transformative power for finance. As Co-Founder and CEO, Hong viewed the market downturn not as a setback but as an opportunity to innovate, meeting scepticism with confidence and a clear strategy. While established players struggled, his team advanced a groundbreaking platform that integrates traditional finance with decentralised finance through secure, blockchain-based self-custody solutions. Drawing on his global experience, Hong now leads Grvt’s ambitious mission to invest on-chain in a more accessible, transparent, and secure way. In an interview with Invezz , he shares insights from this pivotal journey. Invezz: Grvt Strategies is positioned as the world’s first compliant, peer-to-peer on-chain investment marketplace. What motivated you to launch this specific platform now, and how does it address current gaps in both traditional and decentralised finance for everyday investors? As you know, these days, almost everything in our lives has become frictionless. We communicate instantly, move money in seconds, and access endless information with a tap or two. But when it comes to building lasting wealth – trading, investing, and earning in ways that truly compound – we still face obstacles built decades ago. The thing is, for everyday people, it’s hard to grow wealth. Access to quality financial products, simple and professional trading environments, and even basic financial knowledge are limited to a privileged few. Barriers like high investment minimums, non-transparent processes, and exclusionary eligibility requirements shut out the majority. While it’s true that DeFi made a great leap forward, the reality is that parts of it are still hard to fully grasp, and it remains a niche for a very specific group only. As for TradFi industry players, scalability is a major bottleneck because “trust” can’t be automated. This limitation results in complex regulations, licensing requirements, and governance structures designed to manage trust issues, which, in turn, lead to significant operational and legal overheads. These overhead costs are also often passed on to consumers through higher fees, investment minimums, or restrictive terms, effectively pricing out many individuals. So when it comes to addressing these gaps with blockchain technology and specifically what Grvt is offering, the idea is to automate trust, reduce friction, and dramatically improve scalability, benefiting both sides. We achieve those things through a streamlined process. All Strategies are on-chain and non-custodial, while investors engage directly with Strategy Managers without intermediaries. Strategies are built entirely on our secure blockchain, powered by ZKsync technology and using smart contract logic to automate the entire investment lifecycle. This means that every step, from accepting deposits to distributing profits, operates transparently through programmable rules, eliminating the need for manual processes or intermediaries. Historical performance, methodology, and allocations are also visible on-chain. By designing investment logic to be self-custodial and automated, we reduce counterparty risk and eliminate unnecessary middlemen at the protocol level. This makes sure users remain in control of their assets while participating in strategies with clearly defined parameters, fee structures, and risk controls that are all enforced by code. And by integrating blockchain into financial systems, we can build markets that are not only more efficient and transparent, but more importantly, accessible to all. Invezz: It’s clear that regulatory compliance and accessibility are central to Grvt Strategies. Can you share how you achieved both full compliance and open access for retail investors, and what challenges you faced in navigating this balance? For numerous platforms in both TradFi and DeFi, navigating and balancing the dual imperatives of compliance and open accessibility is a key challenge. For us as a platform that wants to bring together the best from both of those worlds, we had to figure out how to solve the scalability bottlenecks faced by TradFi. As for the DeFi and on-chain part, challenges largely came in as two parts: public opinion from the DeFi crowd and regulatory uncertainty. We had a situation where many people thought compliance and open access, especially within the DeFi context, were self-contradictory. Internationally, there are growing discussions around how to better regulate DeFi, but most of those lack a standardised approach, as the whole thing is very nascent to both projects and regulators. In our case, we had to think ahead about which technologies and compliant standards we could use to achieve this balance. I’m glad to say that through blockchain technology, Grvt was able to: Eliminate intermediaries that traditionally existed in wealth management and investing, thus creating better accessibility to retail investors Automate the fund process, and by proxy, solve the scalability issue for institutions Govern the investment logic and process with smart contracts, reducing counterparty risks Add another layer of user fund safety ensured by self-custody In addition, we kept optimizing our platform for users to experience frictionless and seamless onboarding, trading, and investing. For example, Privy became our default onboarding architecture provider earlier this year. Our entire team not only directly reviewed user feedback on a daily basis, but also shipped tons of product improvements and upgrades since Mainnet last December, including UI and UX, bridging, speed, on/off-ramping, etc. As for the compliance front, we set ourselves apart from other decentralised exchanges or swap platforms by implementing AML, along with sanctions screening rules and policies to make sure users are interacting with a “clean” platform. Our measures include transaction monitoring, wallet screening, and trade surveillance tools. The goal is to prevent malicious actors from interacting with the platform, without creating unnecessary barriers for legitimate retail investors at the same time. However, I’d say that maintaining this balance while navigating the rapid evolution of the industry and the regulatory landscape is something we’ll have to deal with constantly in the near future. Invezz: Grvt Strategies is built fully on-chain and uses smart contracts for automation and transparency. How do you ensure security and trust for users, and what unique technological choices were core to your architecture? Good question. I’ll start with our hybrid architecture, which was an intentional and carefully deliberated decision when we founded Grvt. As you may know, Grvt is a private Layer 2 chain that settles directly to Ethereum. From the start, the rationale was to leverage ZKsync technology capable of building this hybrid model, and address major risks we observed with the crypto market, such as: Counterparty risk, so that the ZK structure provides a self-custodial solution CEX-like experience with DEX transparency, where everyday transactions are processed off-chain for high throughput and lower costs (Web2 or CEX model), and the on-chain functionality supports critical operations like final settlement and dispute resolution (on-chain / DeFi / DEX model) Protect trading alpha (which should be private and confidential, rather than full transparency as seen in DeFi maxi platforms) to avoid front running and MEVs If you want a deep-dive analysis of our ZK model, I recommend visiting our blog , where we go into detail. Apart from the architectural level that ensures security and trust, we also adopted a series of measures: Hybrid security that combines both Web2 and Web3 practices, such as two-factor authentication, wallet sig, and role-based access control typically available in Web2 Smart contract audit Invezz: Industry-wise, what do you see as the biggest pain points for retail and institutional investors when it comes to investing, from both technological and behavioural perspectives? How does Grvt Strategies aim to overcome these? For starters, retail investors have no access to high-quality investment strategies or products. These are generally reserved for institutions, hedge funds, family offices, or ultra-wealthy individuals. It doesn’t help that the barriers to entry are high. Minimum investment requirements are often too expensive for everyday investors. Also, discovery and curation are fragmented and opaque, with the lack of a clear, systematic way to explore available investment products and strategies. These offerings are often bundled into complex portfolios by banks or fund managers, reducing transparency and making understanding even more difficult. I’ll give you a more vivid example. When I was a trader at top institutions, I saw firsthand that hedge funds and large players had access to investment opportunities that simply weren’t available elsewhere. Outside of work, I couldn’t access those same opportunities as an individual. That experience really exposed the gap between institutional privilege and retail reality for me. For institutions, the operational process remains a headache, and shooting up overhead costs a lot. Many touch points of some critical function areas still have to be managed and done manually, from fund redemption and due diligence to risk controls and so on. Although DeFi had various great innovations in breaking down the traditional barriers, particularly when it comes to more open access, a lot of barriers remain. Curation is lacking, the entire industry remains niche, and the target audience is only a very small portion of the population who are willing to invest better and more easily. Invezz: With increasing institutional interest in on-chain finance, what trends or obstacles do you foresee for broader adoption over the next year? What is Grvt’s strategy for attracting industry-leading strategy managers and institutional participation on your platform? I feel the biggest trends that will significantly shape the future of the industry are the development of stablecoin infrastructure and Real-World Assets (RWAs). I’m not saying there aren’t other notable aspects, like payment infrastructure, wallet developments, and AI, to name a few, but those two, in my view, are at the center of all that’s happening because they are the foundational layer for Wall Street to come on board. Then, regulatory uncertainty and the establishment of international standards will continue to be a top challenge. It’s unclear which jurisdictions will lead this charge and to what extent institutions will need to follow specific regulations and policies. This makes it difficult to create a level playing field for all parties who want to participate, including both TradFi and DeFi players. It seems to be especially true for RWAs, which directly involve highly regulated TradFi features. As a result, projects like ours are still struggling to get a clear definition of these regulations moving forward.

On a daily scale, some altcoins have produced impressive gains, such as OKB and MNT, both of which have risen by double digits. BTC Back to $115K The primary cryptocurrency peaked last Thursday after an impressive rally that started on Wednesday and culminated in a price surge to over $124,000, where the asset set a new all-time high. However, the following hours were painful as bitcoin quickly retraced to $121,000 before it dumped to $118,000 after the release of the PPI data for July. The weekend was a lot calmer as BTC spent it trading sideways around $118,000. However, the landscape took another turn for the worse on Monday when the cryptocurrency slipped to an 11-day low of just under $115,000 as the markets braced for the meeting between Zelenskyy and European leaders on one side and US President Trump on the other. Although both parties said there was some progress made and Trump even promised security guarantees to Ukraine, BTC failed at $117,000 and quickly slipped below $115,000 earlier this morning.

Holding $10.30-10.40 is critical to avoid flush toward $9.60-9.40 range lows. By Jainam Mehta Uniswap ( UNI-USD ) has broken decisively below its short-term rising wedge, falling nearly 6.6% over the last 24 hours to trade near $10.40. The failure to hold the $11.20 pivot has shifted momentum from accumulation to distribution, with price now testing a confluence of the 200 EMA (45-minute chart) and horizontal support that held between August 12-15. Technical and on-chain picture UNI’s loss of structure comes alongside a bearish RSI divergence and rejection from overbought territory, the RSI is now drifting in the low-to-mid 30s, indicating weak demand on intraday bounces. Price sits beneath stacked resistance from the 50-EMA ($10.75) and 100-EMA ($10.89), meaning bulls must reclaim those levels to delay further downside. Spot order flow data confirms the shift, with approximately $25M in net exchange inflows on August 15 (the largest injection in over six months) consistent with aggressive liquidation and profit-taking rather than accumulation. Uniswap price dynamics (Source: TradingView) On a higher-timeframe structure, Uniswap is trading within a broader range spanning $9.40-11.90 and is currently sitting mid-range around $10.40. This zone represents a low-volume node on the volume profile, which often produces fast moves either back toward $11.00 or down toward mean reversion near $9.60 when momentum builds. If the bulls cannot reclaim the $10.75-10.89 EMA cluster, a sweep of range-lows becomes increasingly likely. A close above $11.20 would be required to shift bias back in favor of recovery targeting $12. Fundamentals and market outlook Sentiment has cooled after UNI’s 87% 90-day rally, as early optimism around fee-switch activation has faded in the face of “sell-the-news” dynamics post Flashblocks integration. Sector rotation has amplified downside, with traders rotating back into BTC ( BTC-USD ) and ETH ( ETH-USD ) as DeFi TVL loses traction and the altcoin season index pulls back. Even so, governance outcomes around the fee switch remain a powerful medium-term catalyst; routing protocol fees to UNI holders would enhance value capture if approved. Regulatory shifts are incrementally constructive, with softer SEC tone following the Ripple ( XRP-USD ) judgment lowering headline tail risk for leading DeFi tokens. Uni’s strategic push into Unichain, a multichain, Layer-2 aligned architecture, also positions it competitively against emerging rivals such as Coinbase’s ( COIN ) Base and Osmosis ( OSMO-USD ). Analysts expect that should governance progress toward revenue share and gasless trading integration, a valuation re-rating may emerge into Q4. In earlier analysis, price holding above $10.80-11.00 was seen as critical to maintaining bullish structure - that threshold has now failed, putting focus on whether $10.30 can hold to avoid a flush toward $9.60-9.40 liquidity.

The recent shifts in the US Dollar outlook , particularly its slight dip ahead of the highly anticipated Jackson Hole Economic Symposium, are not just distant financial news; they ripple through global markets, influencing everything from commodity prices to investor appetite for risk assets like digital currencies. Currency fluctuations can directly affect stablecoin pegs and indirectly shape the investment climate for volatile cryptocurrencies. Staying informed about these foundational market movements provides a strategic edge. US Dollar Outlook: Decoding the Recent Dip The US Dollar has recently shown signs of vulnerability, slipping against major counterparts as market participants adjust their expectations for future interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. This slight weakening follows a period of significant strength for the greenback, driven by aggressive monetary tightening to combat inflation. Several factors contribute to this shifting US Dollar outlook : Evolving Rate Hike Expectations: As inflation data shows signs of cooling, the market is pricing in fewer aggressive rate hikes from the Federal Reserve. This reduces the dollar’s yield advantage, making it less attractive to investors seeking higher returns. Improved Risk Sentiment: A global improvement in risk appetite, partly due to hopes for a soft landing for major economies, encourages investors to move away from safe-haven assets like the dollar towards higher-yielding or growth-sensitive currencies. Economic Data Shifts: Recent economic indicators, while still robust, suggest a potential moderation in US economic activity, prompting speculation that the Fed might soon pause its tightening cycle. This weakening US Dollar outlook can have widespread implications. For instance, it can make dollar-denominated assets, including some stablecoins pegged to the dollar, appear less appealing to international investors, potentially influencing capital flows within the broader digital asset ecosystem. Jackson Hole Impact: A Glimpse into Central Bank Intentions The annual Jackson Hole Economic Symposium, hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, is a critical event for global financial markets. It brings together central bankers, finance ministers, academics, and financial market participants from around the world. Historically, this symposium has been a platform for central bank leaders to signal shifts in monetary policy or provide forward guidance that can have a profound Jackson Hole impact on currency markets. Will Powell’s Speech Signal a Policy Pivot? All eyes will be on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s speech. Investors will scrutinize every word for clues regarding the future path of interest rates and the Fed’s stance on inflation. A more dovish tone could signal an earlier end to rate hikes, further weakening the US Dollar . Conversely, a surprisingly hawkish stance could provide the dollar with a temporary boost. The potential Jackson Hole impact extends beyond just the dollar, influencing global bond yields, equity markets, and even the sentiment around risk assets like cryptocurrencies, as central bank liquidity conditions are a key driver of capital availability. Euro Strength: Is Europe’s Economy Turning a Corner? While the US Dollar has been slipping, the Euro has shown remarkable resilience, registering notable gains against the greenback. This Euro strength is underpinned by several factors, suggesting a more optimistic economic outlook for the Eurozone: Hawkish European Central Bank (ECB): The ECB has maintained a relatively hawkish stance, emphasizing its commitment to bringing inflation down to its target. This has led to expectations of continued interest rate hikes, making the Euro more attractive for yield-seeking investors. Improved Economic Data: Recent economic indicators from the Eurozone, including better-than-expected GDP growth and improving sentiment surveys, have eased recession fears that plagued the region last year. Fading Energy Crisis Concerns: Europe’s energy outlook has improved significantly, with natural gas prices falling from their peaks and sufficient reserves for the winter, reducing a major headwind for the Eurozone economy. The sustained Euro strength indicates a potential shift in economic momentum, challenging the long-held narrative of US economic exceptionalism. This dynamic interplay between the two major currencies is a key component of current global forex trends . Global Forex Trends: Navigating a Shifting Landscape The movements of the US Dollar and Euro are central to understanding broader global forex trends . The currency market is a complex web where the strength or weakness of one major currency can ripple through others, influencing trade balances, capital flows, and investment decisions worldwide. Here’s a brief look at how these trends interact: When the US Dollar weakens, it often makes commodities priced in dollars, like oil and gold, cheaper for international buyers, potentially boosting demand. It can also encourage capital to flow into emerging markets, which might see their currencies strengthen against the dollar. Conversely, Euro strength can make European exports more expensive but also attract foreign investment into the Eurozone. The broader global forex trends are influenced by a multitude of factors, including: Geopolitical developments Commodity price movements Trade relationships Investor risk sentiment Understanding these trends is vital, as they indirectly affect liquidity and investor confidence in all asset classes, including the nascent cryptocurrency market. Monetary Policy Decisions: The Chess Game of Interest Rates At the heart of currency movements are the monetary policy decisions made by central banks. These decisions, primarily concerning interest rates and quantitative easing or tightening, directly impact the attractiveness of a country’s currency. A higher interest rate generally makes a currency more appealing to foreign investors seeking better returns on their fixed-income investments, thus increasing demand for that currency. How Do Central Bank Decisions Shape Your Portfolio? The differing approaches of the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the European Central Bank (ECB) illustrate this point: Central Bank Current Stance Impact on Currency Federal Reserve (Fed) Potentially nearing end of hiking cycle; data-dependent approach. A more dovish shift could weaken the US Dollar as yield differentials narrow. European Central Bank (ECB) Committed to further rate hikes; focused on persistent inflation. A hawkish stance supports Euro strength as higher rates attract capital. These monetary policy decisions create a dynamic interplay that drives currency valuations and, by extension, affects the cost of borrowing, corporate profits, and investor sentiment across all markets. For crypto investors, this means monitoring central bank signals is as important as tracking on-chain metrics, as macro liquidity conditions often dictate overall market sentiment. Challenges and Considerations: Unforeseen Headwinds? While the current narrative points to a weaker US Dollar outlook and continued Euro strength , several challenges and unforeseen factors could disrupt these global forex trends : Inflation Resurgence: A renewed spike in inflation, particularly in the US, could force the Federal Reserve to adopt a more aggressive stance, quickly reversing the dollar’s recent slide. Geopolitical Shocks: Escalating geopolitical tensions, such as those in Eastern Europe or between major global powers, could trigger a flight to safety, benefiting traditional safe-haven assets like the US Dollar . Unexpected Economic Data: Any significant deviation from economic forecasts, such as a deeper-than-expected recession in the Eurozone or surprisingly strong US growth, could lead to rapid currency re-evaluations. Central Bank Surprises: While Jackson Hole is often a platform for signaling, unexpected policy announcements or shifts in communication from either the Fed or ECB could cause considerable market volatility. These potential headwinds underscore the importance of agility and continuous monitoring for investors navigating the volatile forex landscape. Actionable Insights for Investors: Staying Ahead of the Curve For those invested in or observing the cryptocurrency space, understanding these macro shifts is paramount. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Central Bank Communications: Pay close attention to speeches, minutes, and press conferences from the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. Their guidance on monetary policy decisions is a primary driver of currency markets. Diversify Portfolios: Given the volatility in currency markets, a diversified portfolio across various asset classes, including a thoughtful allocation to digital assets, can help mitigate risks. Observe Stablecoin Behavior: While stablecoins are designed to maintain a peg, extreme currency fluctuations or shifts in US Dollar outlook can sometimes test these pegs or influence their perceived safety among international users. Understand Risk-On/Risk-Off Dynamics: A weakening US Dollar often correlates with a ‘risk-on’ environment, where investors are more willing to embrace riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies. Conversely, dollar strength often signals ‘risk-off’ sentiment. Consider Hedging: For investors with international exposure or significant holdings in dollar-denominated assets, exploring hedging strategies can help protect against adverse currency movements. Staying informed about global forex trends allows for more informed decision-making in the broader financial ecosystem. Conclusion: The Path Forward for Currencies The recent dip in the US Dollar outlook and the simultaneous rise of Euro strength highlight a pivotal moment in the global financial landscape. The upcoming Jackson Hole Economic Symposium is set to provide crucial insights into the future direction of monetary policy decisions , which will undoubtedly shape global forex trends for the coming months. While the immediate focus is on central bank rhetoric, the underlying economic fundamentals and geopolitical developments will continue to exert significant influence. For investors, particularly those in the dynamic cryptocurrency market, understanding these macro shifts is no longer optional but essential. The interconnectedness of global finance means that currency movements, interest rate expectations, and central bank liquidity conditions directly or indirectly impact the entire investment spectrum. Remaining vigilant and adapting strategies to the evolving US Dollar outlook and broader market dynamics will be key to navigating the opportunities and challenges ahead.

Amid rising investor activity, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and Solana (SOL) have taken the spotlight. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is priced at $0.035 in stage 6 of its presale. The project’s early investors are set to make a minimum of 400% ROI when MUTM is listed in the public market. Mutuum Finance has already broken over $14.6 million in raised funds and has more than 15400 token buyers. Despite Solana (SOL) remaining stable in the market and investor interest, investors remain interested in MUTM this August. Solana (SOL) Holds Steady around $193 Solana (SOL) is priced around $192.49, up a 5.36% rise in the last24 hours. SOL has had a rollercoaster ride the last week, between a low of $175.05 and a high of $201.82. Despite recent turbulence, Solana has a solid foundation in the crypto world and is now one of the best-performing presale projects. Its robust ecosystem keeps attracting developers and users, forcing it to remain in the game. Mutuum Finance Reaches Presale Stage 6 transition Mutuum Finance is selling well during presale. The project is at $0.035 as stage 6 goes on. Mutuum Finance is revolutionizing the DeFi future with a platform that possesses real-world real-use cases. Presale has managed to acquire over 15400 token holders with over $14.6 million influx. $100K Worth of Tokens to Be Won Mutuum Finance also offers a $100,000 giveaway . 10 individuals will be lucky enough to get a Mutuum Finance prize of $10,000. The contest is only one of the indicators that the project does value having a long-term and a faithful community. And another step towards transparency and security, MUTM Finance (MUTM) has introduced an Official Bug Bounty Program in collaboration with CertiK. The project team is offering the participants a maximum of $50,000 USDT to discover bugs in the project. The Bounty program’s purpose is to catch possible vulnerabilities in the project. Four categories of vulnerabilities are used in the program for segmentation, based on their criticality, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low. Dual Lending Model Mutuum Finance possesses a two-lending framework comprising customers having unparalleled autonomy with respect to Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). Under the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) arrangement, lending pools can be governed by smart contracts, which can opt to modify interest rates with the change in the market situation. Lenders get to have fixed incomes, and borrowers get protection while borrowing. P2P model removes middlemen who possess the power to link lending parties and borrowing parties directly. Any price-risky asset demands this strictly decentralized model with the utmost user freedom. With the sizes of the cryptocurrency market bulging in August 2025, Solana (SOL) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are both investment darlings. Solana continues to reflect stability, strong ecosystem growth, and developer backing, cementing itself as a market leader. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers high growth value through its dual lending system, USD backed stablecoin, and presale phase 6 traction at $0.035 positioning early adopters for possibly gargantuan returns. By means of security audit, bug bounty, and community activity such as giveaways, MUTM integrates innovation, transparency, and community focus.

However, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman still thinks some investors will likely get very burnt, which he says will suck. The OpenAI boss cautioned that startups raising hundreds of millions of dollars with only pitch decks made valuations insane. Capital was frantically chasing a “kernel of truth.” However, Altman stressed that while he did not want to minimize the impact of the AI bubble, he believes AI will create tremendous value for society. The OpenAI CEO said AI will eventually outweigh the froth, and his company was committed to spending more in pursuit of AI’s long-term societal upside. Altman repeated the word “bubble” almost three times in a span of 15 seconds before joking that “someone’s gonna write some sensational headline” about it. He half-jokingly wished they would not, but said he was okay with it. According to a Cryptopolitan report , Altman said his company was set to spend trillions of dollars to construct more data centers soon. However, the CEO humorously said he expected economists to claim OpenAI was reckless and crazy to think of doing that now. Altman says investors are overexcited about AI The OpenAI executive stressed that the industry was at a stage where investors were generally overexcited about AI. He opined that AI was the most important thing recently happening to society. OpenAI also said it was already looking past the cloud capacity of Microsoft’s Azure and actively shopping around for options. Joseph Tsai, the co-founder of Alibaba, was also worried that the AI sector had a bubble brewing in the United States. He was surprised by the scale at which AI companies were spending on data centers and questioned whether it was necessary to spend those many billions. Tsai especially expressed concern over companies that invested in data center construction without confirming if there was clear demand. However, Altman bets that OpenAI’s demand will continue rising, its training needs will continue growing, and its expenditures will be more aggressive than other AI companies. He added that his company had a very deep belief in the progress it was witnessing and anticipating in the industry. However, he acknowledged that his company screwed up the GPT-5 launch. “You should expect us to take as much compute as we can … and we will spend maybe more aggressively than any company who’s ever spent on anything ahead of progress.” – Sam Altman , CEO at OpenAI All the megacaps reportedly raised their capital expenditures to keep up with OpenAI. Microsoft is targeting roughly $120 billion in annual capex, Amazon is looking at $100 billion, Alphabet increased its forecast to $85 billion, and Meta extended its capex to $72 billion. However, Ives believes the industry is only in the “second inning of a nine-inning game.” Rowe pushes back on AI and dotcom bubble comparison Robert Rowe, Citi’s U.S. Regional Director of Research, disagreed with comparing the AI and dotcom bubbles. He pointed out that the dotcom bubble came when many situations were over-leveraged. Rowe added that few companies had earnings back then, but now they do, with very strong funding and cash flow. He stressed that these companies were funding their growth largely with this cash flow. Rowe also said the AI bubble was unlike the 90s dotcom cycle because companies now did not rely on debt to fund infrastructure spending. According to the Citi executive, the current AI investment wave was entirely driven by the global economy’s structural shifts. He particularly pointed out the accelerated growth of digital services, which he said now accounted for a big chunk of global exports. Rowe also believes that AI spending will soon match the contribution of private consumption to GDP growth. However, Altman believes these cycles are part of technology’s natural progress rhythm. The OpenAI boss expects the AI bubble to follow the same trend as the dotcom bubble: lasting transformation after a few high-profile wipeouts.

The message placed institutional access at the center of the update and set expectations for new routes into the network. Details published by Crypto.com confirm that its regulated institutional platform will provide secure custody for VeChain’s native assets, VET and VeThor (VTHO). The arrangement also includes over-the-counter trading capabilities, pairing safekeeping with execution for organizations that require controlled liquidity. The partnership is presented as a way to expand institutional access to the VeChainThor blockchain in a compliant environment. We're pleased to share we have partnered with market leader, @cryptocom , to expand our institutional and custody support options! Through them, we enable access to VeChainThor for a new cohort of stakeholders. New week, new progress! #KeepBuilding $VET https://t.co/yLCWBucsis — VeChain (@vechainofficial) August 18, 2025 How Access Will Work Eligible institutions and high-net-worth clients can store, manage, and transact VET and VTHO through Crypto.com Custody. The service offers multi-user permissions, customizable governance workflows, and insured custody solutions , features intended to meet operational, audit, and risk requirements common to professional allocators. By centralizing onboarding with an established provider, the partners aim to reduce friction for enterprises that want to pilot or scale applications on VeChainThor while maintaining internal controls. Why This Partnership Matters for VeChainThor VeChainThor operates a dual-token model in which VET functions as the value-transfer asset while VTHO covers network fees. The network has also implemented a dynamic fee mechanism modeled on EIP-1559 to help balance demand and costs. These characteristics target predictable operating costs and throughput, criteria frequently used by institutions assessing blockchains for supply chain and data integrity use cases. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 From Crypto.com, President and COO Eric Anziani highlighted the institutional framing, noting that “digital asset institutions require a custodial solution that provides the best possible service from both a security and liquidity perspective,” suggesting that only platforms offering both robust protection and efficient asset access can meet institutional standards. Outlook for VeChain (VET) Analysts have consistently advised investors to accumulate VET based on bullish signals, and this major announcement has reinforced that bullish sentiment. For VeChain, the immediate outcome is an additional, regulated gateway into its ecosystem that fits the project’s enterprise orientation. For institutions, the partnership provides a defined route to hold and transact VeChain assets while working within established governance and insurance frameworks. VeChain has enjoyed a record-breaking year , and the next phase will be measured by onboarding pace, the breadth of clients using custody and OTC services, and any subsequent integrations.

Recently, Glassnode, a leading on-chain analytics firm, shed light on a fascinating trend: while new demand for Bitcoin (BTC) continues to emerge, the overall Bitcoin buying pressure remains surprisingly modest. This insight from Glassnode’s “Supply by Investor Behavior” metric offers a compelling look into the current state of the market, indicating a period of cautious accumulation rather than aggressive buying. What Does Muted Bitcoin Buying Pressure Mean? Glassnode’s recent analysis highlights a peculiar situation in the Bitcoin market. Despite consistent inflows, the strong conviction often associated with significant price movements appears to be missing. The data reveals two key aspects of investor activity: First-Time Buyers: Addresses holding BTC for the first time saw a modest increase. Their holdings rose approximately 1% over five days, from 4.88 million to 4.93 million BTC. This indicates new participants are indeed entering the market, which is a positive sign for long-term adoption. Conviction Buyers: These are addresses consistently accumulating BTC, signaling a stronger belief in its future value. Their holdings increased by 10.1%, moving from 933,000 to 1.03 million BTC. While this growth is notable, it’s crucial to understand that it was smaller compared to the surge witnessed in April. This suggests a slower pace of accumulation among seasoned investors. Therefore, while demand exists, the intensity of Bitcoin buying pressure is not at a level that typically drives significant price rallies. Why Aren’t Investors Rushing to Boost Bitcoin Buying Pressure? This muted response from investors, particularly conviction buyers, raises an important question: what factors are holding them back? Glassnode’s data points to a couple of potential reasons: Insufficient Price Decline: One theory suggests that the recent Bitcoin price decline may not have been substantial enough to trigger strategic “buy the dip” opportunities for larger investors. Many experienced traders and long-term holders wait for more significant pullbacks to increase their positions. Lingering Hesitation: Another possibility is that investors are simply hesitant to accumulate aggressively. This hesitation could stem from various macroeconomic uncertainties, regulatory concerns, or a general wait-and-see approach after Bitcoin’s significant run-up earlier in the year. A cautious stance often precedes periods of clearer market direction. Understanding these underlying sentiments is vital for grasping the current state of Bitcoin buying pressure . Navigating the Current Bitcoin Landscape: What’s Next for Bitcoin Buying Pressure? The Glassnode report paints a picture of a market in transition. On one hand, new demand confirms Bitcoin’s growing appeal. On the other, the lack of aggressive accumulation from established players indicates a pause. For investors, this period could represent an opportunity to re-evaluate strategies. Key Takeaways: Monitor On-Chain Data: Tools like Glassnode provide invaluable insights into genuine investor behavior, helping you look beyond daily price fluctuations. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: New inflows suggest long-term adoption, even if short-term Bitcoin buying pressure is low. Consider your investment horizon. Patience is Key: In periods of muted accumulation, patience can be a virtue. Significant price movements often follow clearer signals of conviction. Ultimately, while inflows are present, the market is awaiting a stronger signal of conviction to truly ignite robust buying pressure. Summary: The Waiting Game for Bitcoin Buying Pressure In conclusion, Glassnode’s latest findings offer a nuanced perspective on the Bitcoin market. We are witnessing consistent, albeit modest, inflows from both new participants and long-term accumulators. However, the intensity of Bitcoin buying pressure remains subdued, suggesting that the recent price corrections haven’t been deep enough to spark aggressive accumulation, or that investors are simply exercising caution. This period of quiet accumulation could be a precursor to future movements, but for now, the market seems to be in a waiting game, observing whether conviction buyers will step up their activity. Understanding these on-chain metrics is paramount for any serious crypto enthusiast or investor looking to make informed decisions in this evolving market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is “Bitcoin buying pressure”? Bitcoin buying pressure refers to the collective demand from investors looking to purchase Bitcoin. High buying pressure often leads to price increases, while muted pressure indicates less aggressive accumulation, even if some inflows exist. Who are “first-time buyer addresses” and “conviction buyers”? “First-time buyer addresses” are new wallets holding Bitcoin for the first time, signaling new market entrants. “Conviction buyers” are addresses that consistently accumulate Bitcoin over time, indicating strong belief and long-term holding strategies. Why is Bitcoin buying pressure currently muted according to Glassnode? Glassnode suggests two main reasons: the recent price decline might not have been significant enough to trigger strategic large-scale buying, and investors may still be hesitant to accumulate aggressively due to broader market uncertainties or a wait-and-see approach. How can on-chain data like Glassnode’s help investors? On-chain data provides transparent insights into real-time network activity and investor behavior, offering a deeper understanding of market dynamics beyond just price charts. It helps investors gauge true demand, supply, and accumulation trends. Does muted buying pressure mean Bitcoin’s price will fall? Not necessarily. Muted buying pressure simply indicates a lack of aggressive accumulation. While it might suggest a period of consolidation or sideways price action, it doesn’t automatically predict a sharp decline. It often means the market is waiting for clearer signals or more significant price catalysts. Did you find this analysis helpful?

With its viral momentum, $LBRETT is being called the Pepe coin killer and the Shiba Inu slayer, creating a new standard for what a meme token can achieve. The presale is live , offering early access at just $0.0044 per token and positioning buyers for potentially life-changing gains. Analysts believe Layer Brett could redefine how memecoins operate with its Layer 2 technology, viral culture, and real blockchain utility. How Layer Brett stacks up against PEPE When evaluating the best meme coin to buy, many investors look to PEPE as a benchmark. PEPE carved out its fame with viral meme energy and rapid price appreciation, but it lacked real blockchain utility and scalable tech. Layer Brett changes the game by integrating Ethereum Layer 2 architecture, delivering near-instant transactions and gas fees that cost just pennies. Unlike PEPE, $LBRETT is more than just a meme—it is a next-gen DeFi coin, a top meme coin with smart contract scalability and staking crypto rewards. Both projects ride the meme wave, but while PEPE has peaked as a trending cryptocurrency, Layer Brett’s presale status and built-in Layer 2 advantages give it long-term growth potential. With a max supply of 10 billion tokens and transparent, community-centric tokenomics, $LBRETT is positioned to outperform PEPE in the race for top gainer crypto status during the next crypto bull run 2025. Why Layer Brett is the Shiba Inu slayer SHIB, the original meme token sensation, set a high bar for viral growth and community engagement. However, SHIB operates on Ethereum’s Layer 1, where congestion and high fees limit usability for many holders. Layer Brett, built directly on Ethereum Layer 2, provides a scalable, low cap crypto gem alternative. Its presale offers entry at a fraction of SHIB’s current valuation, with the ability to stake for massive returns. By leveraging Layer 2 blockchain scalability, Layer Brett eliminates the bottlenecks faced by SHIB, giving users unmatched speed and cost efficiency. Unlike SHIB, $LBRETT is not just hype—it brings real DeFi utility, gamified staking, and Web3 features that reward holders in new ways. This is why many in the crypto community now view Layer Brett as a top contender among the best meme coins and the next 100x meme coin. The LBRETT advantage: Real utility meets meme energy Layer Brett is more than just another meme token; it is a true fusion of fun and function. As the best meme coin to buy in today’s market, it combines explosive meme coin culture with the high-throughput, low fee structure of Ethereum Layer 2. Early buyers can stake their $LBRETT tokens with APYs reaching up to 7500%, far outpacing most altcoins and DeFi projects. As a fully decentralized, no-KYC, self-custodial meme token, Layer Brett is the next big crypto for both meme enthusiasts and serious DeFi users. Conclusion: Don’t miss the next 100x meme coin Layer Brett is still in its presale phase, offering early adopters the chance to secure the best meme coin to buy before the market catches on. With its unique blend of meme power, Layer 2 tech, and real staking rewards, $LBRETT stands poised to outperform PEPE and dethrone SHIB as the leader of the next wave of top altcoins. The opportunity for massive growth and a spot in the $1 million giveaway will not last—act now to join the most scalable and rewarding meme project ever launched on Ethereum. Get in now to stake, earn massive rewards , and ride what could be the most scalable meme project ever to launch on Ethereum Layer 2.

Structural bias remains negative while below $305-312, targeting $275-280 support. Aave ( AAVE-USD ) has dropped sharply to $288 after a failed attempt to reclaim the $335 resistance zone earlier this week. The breakdown from its ascending channel, visible since August 12, triggered a rapid wave of deleveraging, confirmed by $3.3M in net outflows on August 18. Price briefly bounced from the $285-290 support band, but short-term momentum continues to deteriorate as all major EMAs (20/50/100) roll over and begin acting as dynamic resistance near $295-305. Technical and on-chain momentum The RSI remains weak around 41, signaling that bearish momentum persists unless AAVE can recover the $300 psychological level. Liquidation stress has been widespread, with roughly $464M in long positions liquidated across crypto in the past 24 hours, and Aave collateral heavily represented in the unwinding. AAVE price dynamics (Source: TradingView) Technically, the failed breakout above $335 confirmed a bearish head fake, resulting in a full retracement to a long-term February trendline. Unless the price closes decisively back above $312 (the prior breakdown area), the structure favors a continuation toward $275-280 in the near term. Bulls must defend $285 on a daily closing basis to avoid a deeper liquidity probe toward the $268 zone last tapped in late June. On-chain flows offer a mixed view. Recent spot netflows have flipped negative, pointing to renewed exchange supply likely earmarked for sale. However, higher-timeframe accumulation remains visible as whale addresses move multi-million dollar tranches of AAVE into cold storage below $300. This suggests that longer-term participants are beginning to position ahead of upcoming protocol milestones despite near-term technical fragility. Fundamental developments and broader tone Aave is currently in a major transition cycle as it prepares for the rollout of V4, funded by a $12M development grant designed to unify cross-chain liquidity and expand fee capture from 2025 onward. Additionally, the pending institutional lending partnership with Kraken, slated for Q4 2025, introduces the prospect of a new recurring revenue stream. Macro headwinds remain a constraint, however, with Ethereum unstaking delays creating volatility in DeFi funding markets and ongoing Federal Reserve policy tightening continuing to suppress borrowing appetite across decentralized lending protocols. As a result, while the long-term narrative remains constructive, the immediate risk-reward continues to lean bearish unless AAVE can reclaim $305 with strong volume confirmation. In earlier analysis, the $307-312 level was identified as a key pivot following this breakdown . Price now trades below that zone, validating the reversal bias and keeping bears in control unless reclaimed.

Bitcoin’s price action has been uncertain, liquidity pockets are drying up, and altcoin volatility has created both opportunity and risk. In such conditions, the smartest investors don’t chase every move — they accumulate hidden gems quietly building strength beneath the noise. This month, analysts point to Cardano, Aptos, and MAGACOIN FINANCE as three standout plays. Each represents a different kind of opportunity, with one rooted in governance and upgrades, another in technical innovation, and the third in viral presale momentum. Cardano: Governance Powerhouse with Long-Term Utility Cardano has weathered countless market swings, and while recent whale selling created pressure, its fundamentals remain strong. The approval of a $71 million treasury to fund ecosystem growth, alongside Hydra scaling upgrades, reinforces its role as a decentralized governance leader. Trading near $1.25 after a rebound, ADA is still seen as a long-term core holding. Analysts argue that its roadmap, community strength, and focus on sustainability position it as a coin to strategically accumulate during choppy markets rather than chase during peaks. Aptos: Building Quiet Strength in Developer Circles Aptos may not dominate headlines, but beneath the surface its adoption is climbing. With the Move programming language and fast execution speeds, Aptos has attracted meaningful developer interest across DeFi and NFT applications. Currently sitting between $3.37 and $5.74 , Aptos is widely viewed as undervalued relative to its potential. Moreover, market forecasts show multi-year growth potential that underscore its appeal as a slow but steady builder — the kind of hidden gem that long-term capital often rewards. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Presale Momentum as a Strategic Bet In today’s choppy market, hidden gems are where smart capital is flowing. Cardano and Aptos both present strong cases, but MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly become the presale play with the most buzz and the strongest accumulation narrative. Its early rounds have been oversubscribed, fueled by viral marketing, community energy, and a structure designed to encourage scarcity and adoption. What separates MAGACOIN from typical meme launches is its combination of cultural relevance and practical features — including capped supply and transparent audits — which resonate with both whales and retail investors. Analysts say this blend makes MAGACOIN one of the most strategic early-stage accumulations in 2025, especially for investors positioning ahead of a potential exchange debut. It captures the high-risk/high-reward category of hidden gems that thrive during uncertain markets, where bold bets often define the next cycle’s biggest winners. Final Takeaway Market turbulence often pushes investors toward safety, but hidden gems like Cardano, Aptos, and MAGACOIN FINANCE offer a different playbook: accumulate early, hold through volatility, and wait for catalysts to unlock value. Cardano brings resilience through governance, Aptos brings innovation through technology, and MAGACOIN FINANCE brings explosive potential through presale momentum. Together, they form a strategic accumulation trio built for those willing to take calculated risks in a choppy market.

Unilabs Finance (UNIL) , a new AI coin presale, is considered the best crypto to invest in this year. Besides the projected 5x gain on its launch date, its novel AI-driven asset management platform has become the talk of the crypto community. Should Retailers Buy at the Current Solana Price? The Solna price, recently hovering above $200, witnessed a downturn to $190. Despite the sell-off, it is in an uptrend on the monthly and 90-day charts, 8% and 15%, respectively. However, a crucial question before investing at the current Solana price is, how high can the Layer-1 coin go from these levels? Currently, according to CoinMarketCap data, its market size is over $100 billion and has experienced a 22,950% gain since debuting. In light of the above, the L1 crypto’s growth potential is limited, making it not the best crypto to invest in for retailers. Despite daily trading volume increasing by 15% to $4.2 billion and active monthly addresses surpassing 59 million (a 17% decrease) , the current Solana price isn’t a good entry for small-scale investors. Can the Current XRP Price Pull a 10X Gain? AltcoinDaily, popular on CT (Crypto Twitter) for their invaluable market insights, predicts the XRP price could reach $7 this bull cycle . At the current price of $3, the payment-based cryptocurrency might experience a 2x gain, which is significant for whales but not so much for retail investors. As of press time, this top altcoin has a market capitalization of $183 billion, placing it among the three largest cryptocurrencies by market size. As if that doesn’t highlight its limited upside potential enough, the XRP price has exploded by over 50,000% since its launch. While it is a top pick among whales and institutions, the payment-focused altcoin isn’t the best bet for small-scale investors. Experts consider the XRP price closer to its top than its bottom, painting a bearish outlook and making it unattractive to retailers. Unilabs Finance (UNIL) — Whopping $13.5 Million Raised in Early Funding Unilabs Finance (UNIL) continues to make remarkable strides on the ICO block and the broader crypto landscape. At the time of writing, funding has surpassed $13.5 million, signaling growing interest and demand from whales and retailers. Highlighting its bullish outlook are its innovative blend of AI, DeFi and TradFi, as well as massive growth prospects. Courtesy of its bullish narrative, experts consider Unilabs Finance (UNIL) primed for significant growth and adoption this year. It will be the first AI-inspired DeFi asset manager in the world, with its $30 million assets under management spread across four flagship funds: AI, RWA, Mining and BTC. In addition, a 415% gain is expected at the listing price of $0.05 from the current price of $0.0097 in the sixth presale stage. This positions it as the best crypto to invest in this year. Despite being in its early stages and earning a comparison to Uniswap, a DEX platform with a $7 billion market cap, UNIL could outperform with its redistribution of 30% of fees to users. Closing Thoughts Experts believe UNIL, which features a bullish narrative and has plenty of room to run as a presale token, might be the best crypto to invest in this year. While the XRP price and Solana price might witness modest gains, the projected 5x gain on UNIL’s launch date might just be the start of its parabolic run.

With AI integration, UNIL stands out amidst the current crypto market, offering substantial growth possibilities. An Emerging Contender: Unilabs Finance (UNIL) UNIL is making waves with its novel approach, blending AI with decentralized finance (DeFi) and traditional finance (TradFi). This innovative mix has not only piqued the interest of crypto enthusiasts but also attracted substantial early funding, exceeding $13.5 million to date, signaling strong investor confidence and market potential. The initial coin offering (ICO) for Unilabs Finance paints a bright future. With an expected 415% increase from its current presale price, UNIL looks set to outshine its contemporaries by offering a remarkable return on investment. Solana and XRP: Established but Limited Growth? Contrasting with UNIL's promising outlook, Solana and XRP, though established, seem to offer limited short-term growth potential. Despite Solana’s robust infrastructure and recent price uptick, experts argue that its larger market cap and historical performance suggest restrained future growth. Similarly, XRP, while holding a significant market cap and being favored by institutions for its payment solutions, is seen by many as approaching its peak potential, making it less attractive for explosive growth compared to newer coins like UNIL. For more insight on UNIL and its value proposition, interested parties can visit their website or join the discussion on Telegram . Closing Analysis With its unique position as an AI-driven asset management platform, UNIL is not just another cryptocurrency but a potential market leader. Its innovative approach could very well redefine investor expectations in the crypto space, making it a pivotal player in the years to come.

As of August 19, Bitcoin dominance stands at 59.71%, with the 50-day moving average crossing beneath the 200-day, a move that traditionally signals waning strength in the underlying trend. Bitcoin dominance chart. Source: Finbold/TradingView Rather than focusing on Bitcoin’s price itself, dominance measures the share of total crypto market capitalization captured by BTC compared to altcoins. When dominance trends lower, it reflects capital rotation into alternative assets, often coinciding with periods of relative outperformance in Ethereum and other large-cap tokens. Over the past three months, Bitcoin dominance has fallen sharply from highs above 64%, dragged lower by accelerating altcoin inflows and profit-taking after BTC’s mid-year rally. Volumes accompanying this decline remain elevated, with $70.6 billion traded over the last 24 hours, underlining heightened risk appetite outside of Bitcoin. Bitcoin Death Cross technical analysis From a technical perspective, the emergence of a Death Cross suggests that Bitcoin’s dominance may continue to weaken in the near term. Historically, such breakdowns have opened the door to altcoin “mini-seasons,” where capital seeks higher beta plays across Layer-1 tokens, DeFi projects, and even mid-cap narratives. Still, it is important to note that a Death Cross on dominance is not always a guarantee of sustained altcoin strength, especially if broader market liquidity tightens. Momentum indicators reinforce the shift. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for BTC dominance currently sits at 36.42, hovering just above oversold conditions, while the moving average convergence points to persistent downward pressure. This combination strengthens the case that Bitcoin may cede further ground to altcoins unless a sharp reversal in market sentiment occurs.

At this point, Japan, which has taken action to change the country's crypto rules in recent months, is preparing to approve the issuance of JPYC, the country's first yen-denominated stablecoin. At this point, Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA) is preparing to approve the country's first yen-pegged stablecoin this fall. As cryptocurrency movements in Japan accelerate, JPYC, the issuer of the Japanese yen stablecoin, announced that it has officially registered with the Japanese FSA and will be able to issue yen-backed stablecoins. JPYC added that it is the first institution to issue a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the Japanese yen. “JPYC has officially registered with the Financial Services Agency as a fund transfer service provider in Japan. “We can now issue a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the Japanese yen for the first time in Japan.” The JPYC stablecoin will be issued on multiple blockchains, including Ethereum (ETH), Avalanche (AVAX), and Polygon (POL).

This vision is at the heart of Stable, a groundbreaking Layer-1 blockchain, as detailed in a recent report by Asia-based Web3 research firm Tiger Research. Stable is setting its sights on achieving true Stable mass adoption by tackling the biggest hurdles in crypto: fees, latency, and complexity. What Makes Stable a Game-Changer for Stable Mass Adoption? For too long, high transaction fees and slow processing times have kept many potential users away from blockchain technology. Stable addresses these pain points head-on with a bold, user-centric approach. Gas-Free P2P Transfers: Say goodbye to unpredictable gas fees. Stable enables peer-to-peer transfers without any transaction costs, making micro-transactions and everyday use genuinely feasible. Sub-Second Settlement: Waiting minutes or even hours for transactions to confirm is a thing of the past. Stable promises near-instant settlement, rivaling traditional payment systems. Simplified User Experience (UX): The platform aims to demystify crypto for the average person. Its simplified interface removes technical jargon and complex steps, ensuring anyone can use it with ease. This focus on simplicity and efficiency is crucial for driving widespread Stable mass adoption , particularly for those new to the crypto space. How Does Stable Plan to Achieve Widespread Adoption? Stable’s strategy is both ambitious and pragmatic. It begins by offering an irresistible incentive: free, seamless transfers. This initial seeding aims to build a large user base quickly. As the network grows, Stable plans to expand its utility significantly. This phased approach ensures sustainable growth and deeper integration into daily life. Expanding into Payments: Once users are comfortable with free transfers, Stable will facilitate everyday payments, from online purchases to in-store transactions. DeFi Services Integration: The platform intends to support decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, offering users access to lending, borrowing, and other financial services without the usual high costs. Institutional Partnerships: Collaborating with businesses and financial institutions will further legitimize and scale Stable’s offerings, bringing enterprise-level adoption. This comprehensive strategy is designed to pave the way for true Stable mass adoption , transforming how people interact with digital money. The Unrivaled Benefits of a Gas-Free USDT Chain A blockchain dedicated to USDT and free from gas fees offers compelling advantages. USDT, as the largest stablecoin by market capitalization, provides stability and widespread acceptance, making it an ideal candidate for mass use. Consider the benefits: Cost Efficiency: Eliminating gas fees means more of your money stays yours. This is particularly impactful for small transactions. Enhanced Accessibility: Lower barriers to entry mean more people can participate in the digital economy, regardless of their financial background. Superior User Experience: Fast, free, and simple transactions make crypto feel less like a complex financial tool and more like an everyday utility. Ultimately, these features combine to create a compelling proposition for Stable mass adoption , potentially reshaping the future of digital payments. Navigating the Road Ahead for Stable Mass Adoption While Stable presents an exciting future, the path to widespread adoption is never without its challenges. Educating new users about blockchain technology, even a simplified one, remains vital. Regulatory clarity and fostering trust within a rapidly evolving industry are also ongoing considerations. However, Stable’s clear focus on solving core user pain points — fees, speed, and complexity — positions it strongly. By prioritizing a seamless experience and leveraging the familiarity of USDT, Stable aims to overcome these hurdles and truly democratize access to digital assets. The vision is clear: a world where crypto is not just for the tech-savvy, but for everyone. In conclusion, Stable’s innovative approach, highlighted by Tiger Research, offers a compelling blueprint for driving Stable mass adoption . By focusing on a gas-free, USDT-only Layer-1 with sub-second settlements and a simplified UX, Stable is poised to unlock a new era of accessibility and utility for digital currencies.

50330274,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=787390,1755597328,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50330274.jpeg,US Judge backs Logan Paul’s bid to toss CryptoZoo suit,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/texas-judge-logan-pauls-cryptozoo-lawsuit/,"On Thursday, U.S. Magistrate Judge Ronald Griffin said Logan Paul’s bid to remove a lawsuit over the collapse of CryptoZoo should be allowed. He also allowed the class-action complaint to update its claims against the YouTuber. Judge Griffin sided with Paul’s bid to dismiss a proposed class-action lawsuit over his defunct NFT project, CryptoZoo. He said there’s not sufficient evidence tying the YouTuber to the class action plaintiff’s claims of losing money in the crypto project. Judge asks plaintiff to update its claims The federal judge could drop the suit unless the plaintiff updates it. The complaint sued Paul in 2023 for allegedly running a rug pull that promised perks that never materialized, after they bought and lost their CryptoZoo NFTs. The judge urged the plaintiff to update all 27 claims against Paul in the lawsuit, except one. He also mentioned in his 75-page report that the claim alleging the YouTuber engaged in commodity pool fraud should be permanently dismissed. The judge based his decision to dismiss the lawsuit’s commodity pool fraud on not understanding the plaintiff’s logic. The complaint claimed that CryptoZoo NFTs were an option contract due to how they could be traded. Griffin acknowledged that the dynamics of CZ NFTs, which allowed buyers to purchase the tokens unaware of their value till they hatch, made them option contracts. “The mental gymnastics required to come to this conclusion are truly dizzying. Plaintiffs do not explain – nor can the Court understand – how their purchases of CZ NFTs create option contracts or contracts for future delivery.” -Ronald C. Griffin, U.S. Magistrate Judge Griffin also argued that the other 26 claims in the lawsuit failed to properly connect to the YouTuber. He called for more evidence showing that Paul directly and personally benefited from the crypto project’s demise. According to the lawsuit, Logan Paul is accused of fraud, negligence, unjust enrichment, breach of contract, aiding and abetting fraud, fraud conspiracy, and breaches of consumer law in multiple states, among others. Griffin called for the complaint to give full details of Paul’s misconduct and not pieces of facts accompanied by vague attributions. The judge also noted that the complaint combined two different pieces of facts in the vain hope of producing a final, cohesive product. He concluded that the caselaw does not support that kind of tactic. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan, the YouTuber has also faced other allegations of misleading fans about crypto investments. Paul blames CryptoZoo co-founders for the project’s collapse The complaint sued Paul in 2023, together with the project’s co-founders, Eduardo Ibanez and Jake Greenbaum, over their alleged involvement in CryptoZoo’s fall. The YouTuber also tried evading the lawsuit by suing the co-founders of conning him and causing the collapse of the crypto project. Griffin dismissed Paul’s bid in July, arguing that it would result in inconsistent judgments if the court ruled against Ibanez and Greenbaum without a trial because they hadn’t responded to the allegations. The judge argued that the YouTuber’s bid to blame the duo and accuse them of the downfall of CryptoZoo could see the lawsuit go nowhere, as they hadn’t appeared in court. He called for the court to look into whether the duo, together with Paul, committed fraudulent acts while operating CryptoZoo . Griffin also maintained that Paul’s allegations are only against his co-founders and not the claims from the NFT buyers. He said the YouTuber has not demonstrated to the court that there exists any reduced risk of inconsistent judgments based on his claims. The judge concluded that Paul and the co-founders of CryptoZoo are similarly situated and possess closely related defenses. He added that the trio is charged with some strain of joint liability and that ruling on Paul’s motion at the time would undeniably result in inconsistent judgments. Paul wanted to refund the CryptoZoo NFT buyers in 2023 under the condition that they agreed not to sue over the project. He later refunded buyers 0.1 ETH, equivalent to what the tokens were originally sold for in 2021.

In 2010, Bitcoin was worth a few cents. One year later, it hit $20. In six years, it was $17,000, and now it’s sitting at over $100K, after hitting an ATH of $123K in July. Historically, if you’d invested in Bitcoin at launch, you’d have an ROI of 188,643,000%. The likes of Mastercard, JP Morgan, and scores of S&P 500 companies are buying Bitcoin in droves. There’s never been anything like Bitcoin before, and investors are waking up to that reality. However, Bitcoin is getting old for modern standards. No dApps, no smart contracts, and almost non-existent DeFi scalability. It needs an upgrade. And that’s what Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is here to do with Layer-2 technology. Click to learn more about Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a crypto project planning to launch the fastest Layer-2 chain for Bitcoin. Its goal – to bring Bitcoin’s blockchain to modern standards. This means compatibility with dApps, smart contracts, and seamless DeFi programmability for developers. The L2 will run on a Canonical Bridge, combined with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), for native compatibility with Solana. You’ll be able to build token programs, LP logic, oracles, games, NFT infrastructure, DAOs, and much more. All without reinventing the wheel. To engage with the L2, you’ll deposit $BTC to a designated address monitored by the Canonical Bridge. The Relay Program verifies the details, and then mints an equivalent number of wrapped $BTC on the L2. You can also withdraw your original $BTC at any time. If you’re looking for the newest insights on Bitcoin and Bitcoin Hyper, you’re in the right place. We update this page regularly throughout the day with the latest insider insights for Bitcoin maxis and Bitcoin Hyper fans. Keep refreshing to stay ahead of the pack!

HOW TO BUY $HYPER Today’s Bitcoin Technical Analysis Probably the biggest positive sign for Bitcoin today is that its daily candle is resting almost perfectly on the 50 EMA, just as it did yesterday. This shows the token is fighting hard against short-term bearishness to close above key moving averages and reclaim its bullish momentum. While we cannot say with certainty that momentum has shifted decisively in either direction, it’s clear that the battle is playing out at important support levels. What adds an extra edge for the bulls is that price is also sitting in a crucial support zone, the same one that sparked an 11% rally earlier this month. Additionally, Bitcoin is also forming a double bottom on the hourly chart, signaling a potential rebound. To confirm this setup, however, the token would need to close above the $117,048 level, which is its most recent lower high. A close above that would validate the pattern and confirm that the rebound is in play. That said, even though Bitcoin has a couple of important support levels to clear before any real change in long-term bullishness can be confirmed, it’s worth noting that even if the token falls further from here, it would still remain within acceptable correction zones on larger timeframes such as the weekly and monthly charts. While this may slow down upside potential – for instance, where a week ago we might have expected Bitcoin to push past new all-time highs within days – a deeper pullback could simply extend that timeline to a few weeks instead. The US Treasury Department Takes Suggestions About Illicit Crypto Activity in Preparation for GENIUS, Fueling Bitcoin Hyper August 19, 2025 • 10:00 UTC The US Treasury Department started working on implementing the GENIUS Act and is asking for views on dealing with illicit crypto activity. In this sense, the department opened a Request for Comment, which allows ‘interested individuals and organizations’ to: Provide feedback on innovative or novel methods, techniques, or strategies that regulated financial institutions use, or could potentially use, to detect illicit activity involving digital assets. —Treasury Department, Press release The GENIUS Act seeks to establish a strong regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers and protect consumers from ‘deceptive practices.’ With the GENIUS Act on the way, projects like Bitcoin Hyper could see a surge in investor interest. As Bitcoin’s Layer 2 upgrade, Bitcoin Hyper promises faster and cheaper transactions all while keeping Bitcoin’s top security. Based on these goals, our price prediction of a $0.32 $HYPER by the end of 2025, for a 2,410% growth rate, is conservative. Learn more about Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) on the official presale page. Crypto Firm VanEck Predicts a $180,000 Bitcoin in 2025, Injecting Bitcoin Hyper with Bull Juice August 19, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Crypto issuer, VanEck, released its 2025’s Mid-August Bitcoin ChainCheck , where it predicted a $180,000 Bitcoin by the end of 2025. The report analyzes Bitcoin’s performance and issues predictions based on chart indicators and historic precedents. As VanEck shows, Bitcoin’s volatility has reached its lowest levels since 2023, resulting from increased investor confidence and institutional support. This supports the idea of a coming rally that could push Bitcoin to a new ATH of $180,000 by the end of the year. If that happens, projects like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) will experience a massive push, given their utility and long-term scope. Bitcoin Hyper is Bitcoin’s official Layer 2 upgrade which seeks faster transactions and lower fees with tools like the Canonical Bridge.

Bitcoin Leaving Exchanges Has Just Moved Into ETFs In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant has addressed a popular idea that’s present among cryptocurrency traders: that a decline in the Exchange Reserve implies a supply shock could be coming. The “ Exchange Reserve ” here refers to a metric that keeps track of the total amount of Bitcoin that’s being held in wallets associated with all centralized exchanges. Generally, investors keep their coins on these platforms when they want to use one of the services that they provide, which can include selling. As such, it’s often assumed that the tokens sitting on the exchanges represent the sell supply of the asset. An increase in it, therefore, could be a bearish signal for the cryptocurrency. Similarly, a decline could prove to be a bullish sign instead, as it suggests the BTC available for trading is becoming scarcer. This has been the traditional interpretation of what the Exchange Reserve’s trends mean for the market. Today, while the idea does still hold some weight, there is more to the story than just exchanges. Namely, there exists an alternative means of trading Bitcoin now: spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) . Launched in the US at the start of last year, the spot ETFs are still relatively new, but they have quickly cemented themselves as an important corner of the sector. In other words, the full picture of the market today requires looking not only at the exchanges, but also these new funds. Below is the chart shared by CryptoQuant that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Exchange Reserve, as well as the holdings of the spot ETFs, over the history of the cryptocurrency: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Exchange Reserve has been following a steep downward trajectory since last year, a sign that investors have constantly been withdrawing coins from the custody of these central entities. This trend has made some traders believe that the asset is becoming scarcer on the market, a classic bullish signal. But as is apparent from the chart, the rise of the ETFs has offset this decline, meaning that the combined supply held across funds and exchanges is in fact unchanged from its baseline from the last few years. Based on this, CryptoQuant has concluded that the reality isn’t that of a supply shock brewing, but rather that of supply moving from one type of custody to another. “Same coins, different wrapper,” notes the analytics firm. BTC Price Bitcoin slipped below $115,000 during the past day, but it appears the coin has found a small rebound as its price is now back at $116,600.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Exchange Outflows|Bitcoin Supply Shock|btc|BTCUSDT|CryptoQuant,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|EXCHANGE|TRADING|FIAT,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-19 10:00:08

In 2025, Dogecoin stands shoulder-to-shoulder next to Bitcoin. One is the first cryptocurrency, while our doggo friend is widely recognized as the first meme coin. Launched in 2013, $DOGE is up by over 39,000% today, looking at a price of over $0.22 and a trading volume in the billions of dollars. If anything, Dogecoin proves that ‘anything is possible’ in crypto, and even underdogs can become industry giants. With endorsements from industry moguls like Elon Musk and official investment vehicles like the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust, $DOGE seems to be going nowhere but up. Click to learn more about Maxi Doge Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is Dogecoin’s bodybuilder cousin chugging Red Bull and scalping cryptos at 3AM in the morning. Embodying full-send chaos and pump potential 2.0, $MAXI is for degen traders who don’t hesitate and keep diamond hands on some of the riskiest plays. While meme coins are a dime a dozen, Maxi Doge is max-commitment, max cojones, and aiming for legend status in the memecoin land.

Today’s Dogecoin Technical Analysis The next few hours could be crucial for Dogecoin ($DOGE), which has already fallen nearly 2% today, as it’s now firmly within its most recent support zone (blue box) while also rejecting the 50 EMA (on the daily chart). If the token fails to hold these levels and bounce from here, we could see a deeper correction, potentially a steep 14% drop toward the next major daily support level, the one that kickstarted the August rally. That said, conditions have turned quite bearish on the lower timeframes such as the hourly and two-hourly charts, where all the key moving averages – the 20, 50, 100, and even the 200 – are sloping downward with the price trading firmly below them. However, it’d be ill-advised to look for shorts at this point, given $DOGE’s long-term bullish outlook. The smarter approach is to stay patient and wait for a confirmation. The White House Prepares for the Crypto Fall, Creating the Perfect Context for a Maxi Doge Frenzy August 19, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Washington is getting ready for the crypto fall, working to implement pieces of legislation like the GENIUS Act and bring AI innovation into the financial sector. At the same time, regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) are pushing for additional clarity regarding which crypto could qualify as securities. These developments will accelerate during the fall, creating the ideal context for a Maxi Doge frenzy.

Crypto analyst EGRAG CRYPTO has outlined these important targets for investors to pay attention to, as they could be the make-or-break points for XRP. What To Watch Out For With XRP At the start of the analysis, the crypto analyst first implores investors to make sure that they adjust their perspective as things change. This is to ensure that they do not lose sight of the macro picture and are able to keep up with the market trends. That said, there are different levels that are now determining where the XRP price could be headed next, as bulls and bears continue to vie for total control. Related Reading: It Is ‘Genuinely Impossible’ For XRP To Hit $1,000; Pundit Warns After breaking below $3 again, the XRP price is already at risk of being completely overtaken by bears as they continue to mount bear pressure. From here, the determining target lies at the $2.9 support, which the bulls must hold if there is going to be any further decline. As EGRAG CRYPTO explains, if bulls do not hold this level, then XRP could be looking at a more than 10% crash from here. A break of this support would confirm that the price is fulfilling a Wave 5 structure, and the analyst sees this leading to a decline to as low as $2.65. On the flip side of this are levels that could point to a resumption of the upward rally if broken. The first of these is to reclaim $3 decisively before moving toward the $3.13. Once the price is able to surmount the resistance at $3.13, this is where the real action starts as the first major milestone in the move. Related Reading: Two Scenarios Map Out Bitcoin Price Crash After Recovery Next is the $3.20 resistance, which needs a decisive close. As the analyst explains, closing above $3.20 will be the confidence boost needed to continue the upward move, and after here, there is a bit of a gap before the XRP price encounters the next major resistance. Once the price gets to the $3.45 level, then it is gearing up to clear new all-time high levels. This gives way to the very last roadblock to new all-time highs, and that is the $3.65 target. This is where the analyst tells investors to watch as the price makes its way upward.

Cardano has touched $1 again, but Rollblock (RBLK) is emerging as the project that could rally 50x in 2025. With its unique GambleFi model, Rollblock might be the next big crypto that takes center stage while other top cryptocurrencies consolidate. Rollblock Will Surprise With The Strength Of Its Rally Rollblock ( RBLK ) has already shown that it is more than just a new iGaming crypto coin. With over 12,000 AI-powered games, live dealer poker and blackjack, plus a global sports prediction league, Rollblock is bringing transparency to a $500 billion gaming industry. Investors are paying attention because Rollblock ties its token to revenue. Every week, RBLK holders see value flow back through a buyback-and-burn system. Analysts watching the presale say this could make it one of the best crypto to invest in this year, especially as adoption grows. All wagers and payouts are secured on Ethereum, guaranteeing the kind of fairness that traditional platforms cannot match. The project has also integrated fiat payment solutions like Visa and Apple Pay, bridging crypto payment solutions with mainstream convenience. Over $15 million already wagered across the platform Revenue share model ensures holders benefit from growth Licensed under Anjouan Gaming with SolidProof audit security More than 82% of presale tokens already sold at $0.068 Mobile-first design positions Rollblock for mass adoption Crypto Octo recently broke down the project in a YouTube review, calling it one of the top crypto projects for 2025. Watch it here: https://youtu.be/ONh5c192f3o?si=fsTNSby5C_mcEELG . His analysis shows how Rollblock could evolve from an undervalued crypto to one of the best altcoins 2025. With a hard cap of one billion tokens, deflationary mechanics, and live GameFi growth, Rollblock will surprise the market with the strength of its rally. Tokenomics Designed To Defy The Market The brilliance of Rollblock lies in its tokenomics. Only one billion tokens exist, and that supply can never be inflated. Every week, 30% of revenue is dedicated to buybacks, with 60% of that permanently burned and 40% distributed to stakers at APYs up to 30%. The presale has already raised over $11.4 million, with just 42 days left until the eagerly awaited closing date announcement. At $0.068, over 82% of tokens are gone, with exchange listings set to follow later this year. For traders seeking the next 100x crypto, the presale’s fast sell-through makes it one of the best crypto presale opportunities available. When the crypto bull run 2025 accelerates, Rollblock’s scarcity could turn into explosive price action. Cardano Climbing On Strong Momentum Cardano is trading at $0.9113 today. The token has dropped 5.63% over the past day after briefly breaking above $1, but strong buying support is visible. Analyst @ Crypto_wizarddd said: “Cardano $ADA is showing strong momentum, targeting $1.04 as the first key level. A clean break above could accelerate the move toward $1.32.” This comment highlights the resilience of Cardano in today’s crypto chart. Recent updates include EMURGO pausing its Genesis ADA delegation to maintain governance integrity, and a ₳605K allocation to strengthen developer infrastructure with a free CDN. Together, these improvements show that Cardano is still one of the best long-term crypto projects, with whales and institutions supporting its crypto governance. While Cardano remains a leader among top altcoins, its already-large $32 billion market cap makes gains slower compared to new altcoins to watch like Rollblock. Side-By-Side Comparison Metric Rollblock (RBLK) Cardano (ADA) Current Price $0.068 $0.9113 Market Cap $11.4M presale $32.53B Max Supply 1B 45B Revenue Share Yes No Buyback And Burn Yes No Upside Potential 50x Limited Where The Bigger Upside Lies Cardano continues to shine as one of the best altcoins 2025, with strong fundamentals and steady upgrades. Yet compared to the scale of its valuation, the growth ceiling is lower. Rollblock, by contrast, is still small, still in presale, and still building momentum that could lift it to top gainer crypto status. With real revenue, deflationary tokenomics, and a working platform, Rollblock looks like the crypto to buy now for those hunting maximum upside.

Ripple’s latest $3 million investment into Doppler demonstrates how established players are expanding their ecosystems through targeted funding rounds. While this type of institutional backing showcases the confidence big firms place in DeFi infrastructure, retail traders are eyeing a different path to rapid returns. Instead of waiting for Ripple’s venture-backed projects to mature, many are turning their attention to presale tokens like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , where entry prices remain low and upside multipliers stand out as far higher. Ripple Expands Ripple’s XRP surged 9% to ~$3.28, bolstered by Doppler Finance’s $3 million seed round, announced August 7, 2025, to advance the XRP Ledger’s DeFi ecosystem. Led by Reforge VC, with participation from DCG and Hashkey Capital, the raise aims to unlock XRP’s $200 billion idle liquidity through institutional-grade yield protocols. Doppler’s RLUSD Vault, supporting Ripple’s stablecoin, enables users to earn yield, with $50 million TVL already. Technical indicators show XRP breaking $3.20 resistance, with RSI at 62 and support at $3.00, per TradingView. Posts on X note $1 billion in whale accumulation, but macro pressures like U.S. tariffs pose risks. Analysts project a $4.50 target if $3.64 clears, per CoinDesk, though a drop below $3.00 could test $2.80. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): A Retail-Friendly DeFi Protocol Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping its role as a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity platform designed to serve both lenders and borrowers. The project combines two unique models: P2C, or peer-to-contract lending, where users deposit assets such as ETH or USDT into liquidity pools to earn interest; and P2P, or peer-to-peer lending, where terms are agreed directly between lender and borrower. For example, someone who deposits $15,000 USDT in the P2C pool will receive mtUSDT on a one-to-one basis. Those mtTokens grow in value as interest accrues, delivering passive yield without the need for active trading. On the borrower’s side, locking up $1,000 worth of ETH as collateral provides access to up to 75% of its value while still retaining exposure to ETH’s market performance. While Ripple’s institutional play focuses on infrastructure growth, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is opening the door for retail investors to participate in real DeFi activity from day one. That accessibility is why attention on this presale is intensifying. Presale Momentum and FOMO Factor Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 6 of its presale. The token supply sits at 4 billion, with this phase offering 170 million tokens at $0.035 each. So far, more than $14.63 million has been raised from over 15,450 holders, and 22% of the Phase 6 allocation has already been sold. With the next phase raising the price to $0.04, traders are facing a final opportunity to lock in MUTM at this discounted level before the presale moves forward. This presale structure is fueling the type of urgency that seasoned traders recognize on crypto charts when demand outpaces supply. Many are calling it the standout answer to the ongoing question of why is crypto going up despite frequent headlines about a crypto crash today. Revenue-Driven Tokenomics and Staking A central feature of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is its staking model. Users who hold mtTokens can stake them in designated smart contracts to earn additional MUTM rewards. These rewards are not issued from thin air. Instead, they are funded by platform revenue through an open-market buyback strategy. As the lending and borrowing activity grows, the protocol will continuously repurchase MUTM tokens, which are then distributed to stakers. This system aligns tokenholder rewards directly with platform usage, making it one of the most sustainable tokenomic designs in the DeFi market. Adding to this, the project is introducing its own $1-pegged decentralized stablecoin. Unlike other models that allow anyone to mint freely, only approved issuers under strict limits will have that power. Each coin will be backed by collateral such as ETH and automatically burned once loans are repaid or liquidated. Governance will adjust borrowing rates to keep the peg close to $1, while arbitrage trading will provide additional stability. Building Security and Community Confidence Trust is further reinforced by Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s (MUTM) completed security checks. A CertiK audit awarded the token a 95 Token Scan score and a 78 Skynet rating, giving traders confidence in the project’s codebase. To complement that, a $50,000 bug bounty program invites developers to find vulnerabilities, with critical discoveries eligible for rewards up to $2,000. The team has also launched a $100,000 community giveaway that will see 10 winners walk away with sizable prizes, energizing its growing base of over 15,450 holders. Roadmap and Long-Term Vision The project’s roadmap has been laid out across four phases. The introduction stage has already covered presale initiation, audit, and awareness campaigns. The building stage will push smart contract development, advanced features, and risk parameter testing. Finalization will bring beta demonstrations, exchange listing preparation, and broader compliance measures. The delivering phase will mark the launch of the live platform, multiple exchange listings, multi-chain expansion, and institutional partnerships. Each stage builds on the last, and by the time the beta goes live, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will already have a vibrant user community, staking rewards in place, and revenue-driven tokenomics fueling ongoing buybacks. A Clear Investment Edge Consider an early participant who invested $10,000 in Phase 1 at just $0.01 per token. That allocation is already worth $30,000 at the current Phase 6 price of $0.035. Once the presale concludes and MUTM lists at $0.06, the same holdings will reach $60,000 on paper. This trajectory outpaces the gains Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL) have delivered over the same period, underscoring why many traders view Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the next big move in crypto investing. With 22% of the Phase 6 allocation already gone and the price soon set to rise to $0.04, the window of opportunity is narrowing.

Crypto analyst Xaif (@Xaif_Crypto) recently highlighted a repeating technical structure on the altcoin market capitalization chart, which he believes signals the start of 2025’s altseason . The chart shows a third breakout above a descending resistance line, with the analyst projecting a “200x potential” rally if the pattern continues to play out. In previous cycles, similar moves produced sharp expansions. The first breakout in early 2024 was followed by a 150x rally, while the second breakout later that year extended into a 175x climb. Both sequences began with steep declines under a downward-sloping red trendline, followed by a breakout, a retest of the former resistance, and then a sustained push higher. The same formation now appears to be emerging again. The latest breakout signals a massive 200x potential Altcoins are heating up, but all eyes are on $XRP – the leader of the next bull run! pic.twitter.com/W40F4p9uud — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) August 17, 2025 The Structure Behind The 200x Projection Xaif’s chart emphasizes three repeating stages. The market experiences a gradual decline under a descending resistance trendline, then breaks upward through the trendline, and finally retests that breakout point before surging. According to this reading, the market is now completing the third stage once again. The current candle shows a confirmed move above the descending resistance, with the retest holding as support. The breakout has begun as the climb coincided with XRP’s recent rise to a new all-time high . If the structure repeats in line with the earlier patterns, the setup could act as the foundation for a major 200x rally and another altseason. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Positioned at the Front With the market now shifting toward the altcoin season , Xaif specifically pointed to XRP as the likely leader of the next bull run. The reasoning reflects the role of large-cap tokens in early phases of altcoin cycles. When total capitalization breaks out, capital typically flows into assets with strong liquidity and established market depth before rotating into smaller tokens. XRP’s position as one of the largest and most widely traded altcoins makes it a natural candidate for leadership in such a scenario. Experts have consistently predicted that XRP will flip Ethereum in this cycle to become the second-largest cryptocurrency. This will put it at the front of the altcoin market. For XRP to confirm that role, traders will be watching for higher lows, sustained closes above resistance levels, and rising volume during rallies. Early strength in XRP while the broader altcoin market breaks out would strengthen the case for it leading the cycle.

What was once a flurry of activity in the derivatives market now points to a noticeable shift, suggesting a calmer period ahead for the leading digital asset. What Are Bitcoin Options Telling Us? Understanding Bitcoin options is key to grasping market sentiment. Options contracts give traders the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price by a certain date. Premiums are the price paid for these contracts, and their fluctuations often signal underlying market expectations. Glassnode, a prominent on-chain analytics firm, recently highlighted a dramatic shift. On August 15, Bitcoin options premiums soared to a record ~$226 million, with calls making up about 69%. This suggested strong demand for potential upside exposure or hedging against price surges. Decoding the Shift in Bitcoin Options Premiums However, the landscape changed rapidly. By August 18, just three days later, these premiums plummeted to a mere ~$18 million. This steep decline also came with a significant change in trade composition. Puts, which offer protection against price drops, were predominantly sold ($5.5 million received vs. $0.37 million paid). Call options, on the other hand, remained relatively flat. This dramatic shift in Bitcoin options activity sends a clear message. When traders sell puts, they are essentially betting that the price will not fall below a certain level, or they are unwinding existing hedges. The flattening of call options further reinforces this, indicating less aggressive positioning for significant upward moves. This pattern points towards a market less concerned with extreme price fluctuations. Implications of a Calmer Bitcoin Options Market What does this mean for Bitcoin? According to Glassnode’s analysis, this pattern signals two key developments: Fading Hedging Demand: The substantial selling of put options indicates that market participants feel less need to protect against downside risks, suggesting a reduced perception of immediate threats. Expectations for Price Stabilization: The overall decrease in premium activity, especially the shift in puts, points to a collective expectation for Bitcoin’s price to stabilize. Traders anticipate a period of less volatility. A calmer outlook for Bitcoin options can attract different types of investors. Those who prefer less volatile assets might find Bitcoin more appealing. It also suggests that the market may be entering a consolidation phase, providing a more predictable environment for long-term strategies rather than short-term speculation. Navigating Future Bitcoin Options Insights For investors and traders, these insights from Bitcoin options are invaluable. While no single metric can predict the future with certainty, the collective behavior in the options market offers a powerful barometer of sentiment. A stable market can be an opportune time for strategic accumulation or for exploring new use cases for Bitcoin without the immediate pressure of extreme price swings. However, market dynamics can change quickly. Staying informed through reliable sources like Glassnode and continuously monitoring key indicators remains essential. The current data suggests a period of relative tranquility, but vigilance is always a wise approach in the fast-paced crypto world. In conclusion, the recent plunge in Bitcoin options premiums, as reported by Glassnode, paints a picture of a market moving towards greater stability and reduced volatility. This shift from high hedging demand to a more balanced outlook suggests participants anticipate a calmer journey for Bitcoin. This could usher in a period where long-term value and fundamental growth take precedence, offering unique opportunities for thoughtful engagement with the leading cryptocurrency. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are Bitcoin options? Bitcoin options are derivative contracts that give traders the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) Bitcoin at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. What do options premiums indicate in the crypto market? Options premiums are the prices paid for these contracts. Higher premiums often suggest higher demand for hedging or speculation, while lower premiums can indicate reduced market uncertainty or less aggressive positioning. Why did Bitcoin options premiums recently drop significantly? Glassnode reported a sharp drop from ~$226 million to ~$18 million, primarily due to a significant selling of put options and flat call options. This indicates a decrease in hedging demand and a shift towards expectations of price stabilization. What does “fading hedging demand” imply for Bitcoin’s market? Fading hedging demand suggests that market participants perceive less immediate downside risk for Bitcoin. They are less willing to pay for protection against price drops, indicating a more confident or neutral outlook. How might a calmer Bitcoin options market affect investors? A calmer market, signaled by reduced volatility expectations, can attract investors who prefer less speculative environments. It might also lead to a period of consolidation, favoring long-term investment strategies over short-term trading. Did you find this analysis insightful?

The withdrawals were led by BlackRock and Fidelity, and was a sharp reversal from the $3.7 billion inflows that were seen over the prior eight sessions. Alongside ETF redemptions, Ethereum’s staking ecosystem is also under pressure, with over 910,000 ETH queued for unstaking. Despite the pullback, ETH ETFs continue to gain ground relative to Bitcoin ETFs, and analysts still predict they could surpass BTC products in terms of supply percentage by September. Meanwhile, a retail trader turned $125,000 into $7 million through leveraged ETH longs, even as whales sold off their holdings. Ethereum ETFs Hit by Outflows Spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) began the week with a sharp downturn , and recorded close to $200 million in outflows on Monday as part of a sell-off trend that started late last week. Investors pulled $196.7 million from Ethereum ETFs, which was the second-largest single-day outflow since the products launched. Monday’s withdrawals followed Friday’s $59 million, bringing the two-day total to $256 million. ETH ETF flow (Source: Farside Investors ) The scale of the recent outflows stands in contrast to the massive inflow streak that came before them. In the eight trading sessions before Friday, Ethereum ETFs brought in a record $3.7 billion, with some single days seeing more than $1 billion in fresh inflows. Despite the reversal, appetite for Ethereum through regulated investment vehicles is still quite strong when compared with historical levels. Among the issuers, BlackRock and Fidelity experienced the largest investor pullbacks on Monday, with outflows of $87 million and $79 million, respectively. The outflows followed Fidelity’s big $272 million withdrawal from its Ethereum Fund on Friday. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA), which is one of the largest Ethereum funds, held about 3.6 million ETH valued at $15.8 billion as of Friday. By Monday, its dollar value slipped to $15.6 billion after ETH’s price dropped by about 6.5%. At the same time, Ethereum’s staking ecosystem is showing signs of strain. ValidatorQueue data indicates that the Ether unstaking line reached a record 910,000 ETH, worth almost $3.9 billion, with validators now facing wait times of more than 15 days to exit. Some analysts see the trend as potentially bearish. Bitcoin advocate Samson Mow said that while “the flippening will never happen, the unstakening is coming.” He also suggested that ETH’s price relative to Bitcoin could fall to 0.03 BTC or lower, down from the current 0.036 BTC. Even so, Ethereum ETFs have been gaining ground on their Bitcoin counterparts in terms of overall adoption. Data from Dragonfly’s Hildobby showed that as of Monday, Bitcoin ETFs held about 6.4% of the total BTC supply, compared with 5% for Ethereum ETFs. If current trends continue, analysts predict Ether ETFs could surpass Bitcoin ETFs in terms of supply percentage by September. ETH Trader Turns $125K Into $7M While the crypto space is keeping an eye on ETH ETF flows, a crypto investor made headlines after transforming a $125,000 Ethereum trade into millions. This happened despite the market’s recent volatility and profit-taking by large holders. According to blockchain data platform Lookonchain , the trader deposited his initial stake onto the decentralized exchange Hyperliquid and skillfully compounded profits by continuously rolling gains back into his long position. Over four months, this strategy built an enormous $303 million position and pushed his peak paper gains above $43 million before the latest downturn. While the broader market pulled back, the investor exited all positions on Monday, locking in a net profit of $6.86 million. The return equates to an impressive 55-fold gain on the initial $125,000 investment. The win happened as other Ethereum whales began reducing exposure after last week’s ETF outflows, which triggered expectations of a deeper correction. On-chain data from Nansen showed that wallet “0x806,” which is ranked among the top 100 Ether traders, sold more than $9.7 million worth of ETH on Monday. This was the second-largest Ethereum transaction in 24 hours. Another whale wallet, “0x34f,” sold $1.29 million, while numerous others also locked in millions in profits. Market analysts suggested that Ethereum’s strong rally over the past few weeks invited a wave of profit-taking, dampening immediate upward momentum and instead pointing toward potential consolidation. Ryan Lee , chief analyst at Bitget exchange, warned that Bitcoin and Ethereum are still vulnerable to sharp swings given the heightened leverage in derivatives markets. He added that macroeconomic signals from the US Federal Reserve are also very crucial. Any hawkish rhetoric or a delay in expected rate cuts could put more pressure on crypto assets. For now, CME Group’s FedWatch tool indicates an 82% chance that the Fed will keep rates unchanged at the upcoming Sept. 17 meeting.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|BTC|BUSINESS|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-19 12:00:00

Estimates for GYEN’s average value in 2028 range from $0.0226 to $0.0273. GYEN’s average trading price in 2031 will be $0.0679, with a maximum price of $0.0803. GYEN is a fiat-backed stablecoin built on the Ethereum blockchain. The code is open-source on Github. The price of Gyen digital assets is pegged to the Japanese Yen (JPY) value. GYEN is backed by JPY in a 1:1 ratio. The collateral JPY is held at FDIC-insured bank accounts. Bank reserves are audited monthly. GMO-Z.com, the company behind GYEN and ZUSD, is regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services. It is the first company to offer a JPY-backed stablecoin. GYEN is a stablecoin provider that aims to stabilize the money market in crypto with multiple use cases. Most crypto-related companies like Gemini, Circle, and Coinbase offer USD-pegged stablecoins and other issue tokens backed by other fiat currencies. Trouble starts when these exchanges freeze accounts for weeks, potentially locking in large customer losses. GYEN was primarily designed for trading. It allows investors to trade cryptocurrency and yen pairs without any need for centralized assets. Currently, GYEN can be traded on five exchanges: Liquid, INX, Nexus, Coinbase, and Uniswap. Will GYEN reach $1? How high can GYEN go in five years? Let’s take a look at GYEN’s technical analysis and price prediction to provide answers to these queries.

Coin value has increased up to 0.30% from its previous close. GYEN price is yet unable to break above the $0.00693 boundary. On August 19, 2025, the GYEN price analysis indicates a positive market trend. The cryptocurrency’s value currently stands at $0.00678, reflecting a 0.30% increase in the last 24 hours. A reversal in the current market momentum is also possible as the price volatility is high. However, the current upward movement signifies strong buying demand around resistance channels. GYEN price analysis on a daily time frame Trading at $0.00678, the cryptocurrency has experienced a slight increase since yesterday. However, the coin’s value is still below the moving average. There are chances of a reversal as a downtrend occurred yesterday and the volatility is high. The gap between the Bollinger bands indicates market volatility. As the bands maintain a significant distance, this signals increased market volatility. The upper band of the Bollinger Bands indicator, serving as the resistance band, is at $0.00724, whereas the lower band, acting as support, is around $0.00648. GYEN/USD 1-day price chart. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is within the neutral region. Its value is at 48.57 and is moving sideways, which indicates a balanced market setup. GYEN price analysis on a 4-hour chart The four-hour price analysis of GYEN also confirms an uptrend for the cryptocurrency. A bearish strike was observed at the start of the day as the bears secured a brief comeback. The cryptocurrency value now stands at $0.00678, following the increase in the past few hours. This indicates that the buying activities continue to dominate the selling positions. The volatility has also increased, suggesting high market unpredictability. Moreover, the upper boundary of the Bollinger bands indicator is at $0.00723, determining a resistance point.

GYEN price analysis suggests a cautiously bullish outlook. The coin has risen to $0.00678 today, a 0.30% increase. Price charts indicate bullish momentum, and technical indicators also side with the buyers. However, there’s a growing possibility of a market reversal. Is GYEN a good investment? Looking at GYEN in the near term can make it a poor investment. It can, however, be invested for a large return over the long run. The price forecast for GYEN by 2028 suggests an average price of $0.0232, making it an excellent opportunity to purchase and benefit enormously. Why is GYEN up? The cryptocurrency market is under bullish pressure, and so is GYEN. The token has gained bullish traction and gained around 1.21 percent over the past week. The GYEN price has increased to $0.00678, gaining 0.30% of its value over the past day. Will GYEN reach $0.01? GYEN may approach $0.0100 in 2027 based on the market’s maximum forecast of $0.0188 for the year. Will GYEN reach $0.05? According to the long-term predictions, GYEN is projected to reach up to $0.0659 by 2030. Will GYEN reach $1? Even though GYEN shows a promising long-term future with consistent growth potential, reaching up to $1 by 2031 is impossible. Does GYEN have a good long-term Future? GYEN is a stablecoin pegged to the Japanese yen and is often considered stable by buyers, however, GYEN has been a suspect of extreme devaluation and wild swings in its history. GYEN has, at times, lost value, defying the fact that it is pegged to the yen. Market analysts expect GYEN’s price to reach $0.0803 by the end of 2031, substantially higher than its current price.

GYEN historic price sentiment GYEN price history: Coinmarketcap GEYN, a cryptocurrency pegged to the Japanese yen, was first offered in March 2021 as a stablecoin. The opening price of GYEN was $0.00922, but it soon depreciated to $0.00914 in April before spiking to $0.01028 briefly in May. GYEN coin dipped to $0.00851 in July and observed another low of $0.00820 in August 2021. The lower price of GYEN coin soon triggered a buying impulse, which jumped to $0.0092 in September. The crypto pair consolidated near $0.0092 until September 2021 before breaking lower to $0.0087 in November. GYEN observed its all-time high of $0.06075 on November 17, 2021. However, the highest price was a sudden spike followed by a sharp dip to $0.0087, after which GYEN consolidated again until March 2022. In the same month, GYEN started to contract further in value and continued its downslide till the end of September 2022, reaching $0.0066. In November 2022, GYEN started to recover again, but it could only gain a level of $0.0077 till January 2023, when a slow downfall started again. In July 2023, GYEN dipped to $0.0069, and it closed the year near the same price level. 2024 also proved to be a troublesome year for GYEN, as it dipped to $0.00612 in February. The cryptocurrency slightly recovered in February and March, but overall, the downslide continued. GYEN traded between $0.0065 and $0.0060 from April to June and reached the $0.00607 level in July. On August 10, 2024, GYEN started to observe its new all-time low of $0.00569 before starting a recovery phase. The recovery was also short-lived, and GYEN started to oscillate downwards again, reaching its all-time low of 0.004928 on November 05, 2024, before closing the year at $0.00633. GYEN started a slow upward trend in February 2025, and jumped to $0.0099 at the end of March but could not sustain the position, and maintained its average price near $0.0066. In May 2025, GYEN dipped to a new all-time low of $0.00221, while it jumped to $0.010 in July, showing its volatile nature, as the price took a dip soon after.

However, with investors quickly buying the dip, many experts believe that Pepe and Dogecoin could be two of the best cryptocurrencies to buy now, alongside Rollblock. Rollblock has the potential to offer meme coin level returns, though with greater utility and a rapidly growing ecosystem, it’s expected to outperform meme coins long term. Here’s why investors are bullish. Could Rollblock be the Best Crypto to Buy Now? Rollblock is the perfect combination of DeFi hype and utility. Its GameFi platform has gained massive traction over the last year, attracting over 50,000 players who have placed more than $15 million in wagers. The platform is compatible with over 50 major cryptocurrencies and hosts more than 12,000 games. These include classics like poker and Monopoly as well as new AI games and an innovative sportsbook. The sportsbook covers major sports such as the NBA, NFL, soccer and more. Security is a key component of Rollblock. All wagers are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain and the platform is licensed by the Anjouan Gaming authority. Rollblock’s smart contract has also been audited by SolidProof to validate the project’s security. In addition to its gaming opportunities, Rollblock also gives investors the chance to profit from its platform. By staking tokens investors can take part in Rollblocks’ revenue share model. Here’s how it works. Each week Rollblock takes a portion of its revenue to buy RBLK from exchanges. 60% of these tokens are burned, making RBLK deflationary. The remaining 40% is used for rewards, allowing investors to profit even if they don’t want to play games. Rollblock has become one of the most popular presales in the crypto market. During the presale RBLK tokens have rallied by over 500% and are now available for $0.068. According to experts, Rollblock could reach $1 by the end of 2025, driven by thousands of new investors entering the presale. As a result, investors need to act fast if they want to capitalize on RBLK at its current low price. Pepe Dips to Key Support Over the weekend Pepe experienced several price declines, taking its weekly loss to 7.24% . Pepe is now consolidating in a symmetrical triangle pattern, which is usually a precursor for a breakout in either direction. Following its recent decline, Pepe is now trading at $0.00001076 with a daily trading volume of $4.52 billion. According to chart analysis, Pepe’s next major support is at its 200-day moving average of $0.00001003. Should Pepe drop this low, investors are likely to buy the dip, triggering a price increase. Grayscale Files for Dogecoin ETF On Friday, August 16, 2025, Grayscale Investment filed an S-1 form with the SEC to release a Dogecoin ETF. If approved, this will be the first meme coin to receive an ETF and it could result in a significant Dogecoin surge. Despite this bullish news, Dogecoin’s price has fallen by 2.57% over the last week, taking Dogecoin to $0.2229 as of August 18. Which Is The Best Cryptocurrency to Buy Now? While Pepe and Dogecoin’s dips might be a good opportunity to buy, both are expected to see huge fluctuations over the next few weeks. For Rollblock, on the other hand, it’s all up from here. RBLK tokens are expected to rally over the next week with analysts predicting a rise to $1 before the end of 2025. Discover the Exciting Opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) Presale Today!

These positions would get liquidated if ETH drops to $4,200. Meanwhile, the ongoing wave of sell-offs puts the largest altcoin by market cap at risk of dropping to this level. $2 Billion In Liquidations On The Horizon Amid Ethereum Price Crash Coinglass data shows that $2 billion in ETH long positions are at risk of being wiped out on exchanges if the Ethereum price drops to $4,200. The liquidation heatmap shows that there is a massive cluster waiting to be triggered. Therefore, further declines to the downside could trigger a wave of forced selling even as traders rush to close their positions. Related Reading: Ethereum 4-Week Trend Shows When It Is Time To Sell Everything However, a positive for the Ethereum price is the fact that more traders are currently short than long. As such, market makers could hunt for liquidity at higher levels up to $4,500, where $2.8 billion in short positions could be wiped out if ETH reaches there. Market commentator Zerohedge also highlighted how the net ETH shorts are at new highs on the CME. Based on this, he remarked that these short traders are “generously providing liquidity into the new all time highs.” Notably, these shorts were at new highs back when ETH broke above $4,000 earlier this month. Meanwhile, ETH continues to see massive demand from the Ethereum treasury companies. The largest ETH treasury company, BitMine, yesterday announced that over the past week, it increased its ETH holdings by $1.7 billion to $6.6 billion. In the process, it added over 373,000 coins, increasing the total from 1.15 million to 1.52 million coins. Such purchases put massive buying pressure on ETH, which is bullish for the Ethereum price. Sell Pressure From ETFs And Whales It is worth noting that the Ethereum price is currently facing selling pressure from the ETH ETFs and some whales, which can be bearish for the altcoin in the near term. SoSo Value data shows that these funds recorded a net outflow of $196.62 million on August 18. BlackRock’s ETHA, the largest ETH ETF, saw a net outflow of $87.16 million. Related Reading: Pundit Predicts ‘Near Term’ Bitcoin And Ethereum Prices, There’s Still Room To Run This marked the second consecutive daily net outflows for the Ethereum ETFs. These funds had recorded an outflow of $59.34 million on August 15. Meanwhile, on-chain analytics platform Lookonchain revealed that whales like Longling Capital are offloading ETH. Longling Capital sold 5,000 ETH today, locking in profits. A whale that has been dormant for a year has also begun selling and has sold 3,075 ETH so far. At the time of writing, the Ethereum price is trading at around $4,230, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

However, this has not been the case as sellers have been able to dominate once again and have pushed the price back downward. Most of this bearish pressure looks to be driven by large hedge funds , who continue to bet against the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap in record numbers. Ethereum Shorts Reach Record Levels As the Ethereum price has crossed $4,000 , so have the shorts piled on, with many expecting the rally to run out of steam. Mostly, these short numbers are being driven by large hedge funds, pushing down the Ethereum price. This is not the first time, as hedge funds have continuously tried to suppress the ETH price in order to minimize losses on their end. According to data from the Net Positions of CME Ether Futures dashboard on The Block’s website, these short numbers have actually risen to levels not seen before. For hedge funds alone, they have almost doubled their short positions in the month of August. As the website shows, the total number of hedge fund-driven Ethereum shorts was sitting at $2.3 billion on August 5. However, this figure has quickly grown to $4.19 billion at the time of this report. This suggests that hedge funds are still expecting the Ethereum price to break down from here . Other Positions On ETH In contrast to hedge funds, asset managers have remained rather bullish on Ethereum. The data shows that they continue to be long Ethereum, rising to over $1.22 billion in the positive at the time of this report. While this is prominent, it still falls short of the bearish positions, showing that there is more shorting going on. Non-reported positions remain in the positive at $77.5 million. Meanwhile, there is also the “Others” position, which often encompasses retail and the likes, and that comes out in the negative at -$397.5 million, adding more fuel to the shorting going on. For the hedge funds, the more the Ethereum price rises, the more they lose money, and the lower the price goes, the more money they make. However, with short positions at record levels , historical performance suggests that times like these are when a short squeeze is likely, and the price could rally as a result.",Ethereum|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|ethereum news|ethereum price|ethusd|ETHUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-19 12:00:18

As highlighted by market commentator Xaif on X, several whales attempted to short XRP with massive positions — ranging from 40,000 to 100,000 tokens each — only to see their trades backfire spectacularly. Instead of raking in profits, these traders were forced into heavy losses as their shorts were liquidated . The Failed Short Attack The failed move unfolded as XRP hovered in the $3.00 to $3.30 range. Large short positions clustered at key levels, setting the stage for what many believed would be a profitable downturn. However, rather than breaking lower, XRP’s price surged, triggering stop-losses and automated bot-driven liquidations. SHORTS GETTING RIGGED! Whales tried to bet against #XRP with massive shorts… -100K, -60K, -54K, -40K XRP But instead of profit, they got wrecked Bots forced to close with huge losses The battlefield isn’t against XRP… it’s against the shorts pic.twitter.com/bZ7xRS6Evp — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) August 19, 2025 Once the chain reaction began, short positions were rapidly closed out, leaving traders on the wrong side of the market with millions in losses. Price Action and Liquidations As of report time, XRP is trading at $3.01 after experiencing intraday swings between $3.05 and $3.30. Data from derivatives trackers confirms that the sharp move upward triggered a significant wave of liquidations , with short sellers bearing the brunt. Reports indicate that major liquidations occurred at around $3.14, wiping out a large portion of the leveraged positions. A brief liquidity crunch hit XRP markets before prices rebounded to around $3.00. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Why Shorts Got Crushed Two key factors explain why these whales were wrecked. First, the concentration of short orders near obvious support levels created a vulnerable liquidity pool. This made it easier for large buyers and trading algorithms to push XRP upward, forcing shorts to cover. Second, automated trading systems amplified the squeeze, converting what might have been a minor move into a rapid surge that overwhelmed leveraged traders. In effect, the whales set a trap for themselves by betting too heavily against XRP at predictable levels. What This Means for XRP Going Forward The liquidation wave has two clear implications. For short-term traders, it underscores the risks of betting against XRP during periods of heightened volatility. The $3.00 level has now become a focal point, acting both as a psychological support and a potential battleground for future squeezes. For long-term holders, the event reduced some of the speculative short pressure but also underscored XRP’s capacity for violent price swings. Xaif’s observations confirm that the real battle is not between XRP bulls and bears, but rather between the market and overleveraged shorts. Another example of XRP defying attempts to drive its price down with massive shorts, resulting in significant losses.

Analysts now target $1.18 if key resistance gives way. Meanwhile, a newcomer, Remittix (RTX) , is exploding past $20.2 million in presale funding, drawing investor attention with real utility and listing momentum. Cardano Price Prediction: Rally Toward $1.18 in View The Cardano price prediction models hinge on ADA solidifying support above $0.88. Daily volume is trending up, and on-chain activity shows steady wallet growth, suggesting renewed interest in staking and DeFi use cases. Analysts tracking Cardano note a strong golden cross forming, often a bullish signal, and expect ADA to test $1.18 if it breaks $1.00. Source: X (Twitter) That growth would represent nearly a 28% gain, making ADA one of the more measured best crypto to buy now plays in major-cap altcoins. But for those seeking higher leverage and raw upside, early-stage opportunities like Remittix are capturing capital while ADA charts a steady climb. Remittix Presale Hits Critical Milestones Fast Remittix (RTX) is not an ETF or a meme token. It’s a PayFi infrastructure project that’s now raised over $20.2 million. This milestone will trigger the reveal of its first centralized exchange (CEX) listing, which is BitMart. Investors see this as a clear setup for explosive growth, encapsulating many of the best crypto presale 2025 attributes. Here’s why Remittix has all the attention.

Act Now, Stability with ADA, Asymmetric Upside with Remittix The Cardano price prediction reflects credibility and slow, sure growth. But Remittix offers a wild card: utility, momentum, and listing catalysts ready to deliver real exponential upside.

The recovery follows a recent sharp reversal experienced by the rival platform, LetsBonk. According to analysis by Blockworks, Pump.fun’s market share rallied from as low as 5% just two weeks ago to 90%. LetsBonk previously held over 80% of the market share but has dropped to just below 3%. The market share is calculated by tracking the graduated tokens, a key indicator of platform activity. Pump.fun reclaims Solana launchpad dominance Pump.fun’s recovery has been accompanied by increased market activity on the platform. Today alone, 19,060 tokens have been launched , with a 0.74% graduation rate, against 535 tokens launched on BONK with a 1.31% graduation rate. Trading volume in the last 24 hours has reached $133.9 million. 🚨JUST IN: https://t.co/VS31GZ2FXq ’s weekly revenue climbed to $13.48M, its highest in six months, after regaining the majority of Solana launchpad market share. pic.twitter.com/vnpIkfrTvR — SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) August 19, 2025 Some analysts have noted that the current shift was driven by top memecoin deployers abandoning LetsBonk. They revealed that the top 10 creators, who are largely automated bots, began dominating on Pump.fun, causing an overnight reversal in market dominance. Coinbase’s head of product, Conor Grogan, also noted that such bot activity accounted for most of the memecoin launches across the platform. Pump.fun’s turnaround has also been supported by the recent token buyback program between August 5 and 11. The platform repurchased approximately $8.42 million worth of PUMP token , representing 97% of that week’s revenue. The launch platform has now bought $33.13 million worth of PUMP since the start of the buyback program, which marks 0.729% of its total token supply. The buyback program supported the immediate short-term recovery in PUMP’s price. The token is trading at $0.002877, a 17.33% drop throughout the past week and a 9.06% drop today. Despite the strong recovery, the token is still trading below its all-time high of $0.006812, which was set briefly in July after the platform sold $600 million tokens in 12 minutes. The token’s 24-hour volume is down 16% trading at $246.8 million. Pump.fun’s strong recovery puts pressure on LetsBonk In July, LetsBonk overtook Pump.fun with a 74% market share of daily launches, while PUMP token revenue fell to as low as $169,000. Pump.fun made a comeback in early August with high scores in daily revenue, user activity, and token graduations. On August 6, it recorded daily revenue of $1.38 million compared to LetsBonk’s $282,000, with more than 23,000 token launches. According to Dune Analytics data , current user activity for Pump.fun stands at 38,295 compared to 633 for LetsBonk . The latest transactions updated 22 hours ago show Pumpfun at 548,834 compared to 33,716 recorded by LetsBonk. LetsBonk has begun recovery measures to regain lost ground by recently introducing new incentives. It has added a Points tab on its platform, which suggests plans for a reward program to encourage creators and traders. The launchpad platform has also announced that it will direct 1% of its revenue towards buybacks of leading tokens in the ecosystem. BONK, the native token for the LetsBonk platform, is currently trading at $0.00002234, 0.41% down today and 7.25% over the past week. The price is still more than 50% below its all-time high of $0.000058. The 24-hour volume is $222.6 million, down 18.97%, and currently ranks 4th among other Solana launchpads in terms of combined weekly revenue, token launches, token graduations, and active addresses. The renewed competition across Solana launchpad platforms shows the volatility around the blockchain, where shifts in deployer activity and tokenomics strategies have quickly altered the market share. Markets await to see if Pump.fun’s $13.48 million weekly revenue highlight will help the platform maintain the lead amid the launchpad wars. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

The altcoin ranks among the top 3 losers in the top 100, down 17%, fueled by unsuccessful Russia-Ukraine peace talks and hotter-than-expected U.S. PPI inflation data, which dent hopes for a September rate cut. Still, analysts anticipate up to four rate cuts before year-end, with the potential to stimulate new demand for risk assets like cryptocurrencies.

Meanwhile, prominent whales are buying-the-dip. Lookonchain reports that Crypto billionaire Arthur Hayes pulled a 180 on a 7.76 million ENA token dump, buying back higher around its August 11 peak. Two weeks ago, Arthur Hayes( @CryptoHayes ) sold 7.76M $ENA ($4.62M) at ~$0.595 to lock in a $1.65M profit. Recently, he bought back 2.14M $ENA ($1.75M) at a higher price of $0.816. https://t.co/1HymJRPhcj pic.twitter.com/COZNMeBpvF — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) August 13, 2025 Hayes has since doubled down , bringing the total accumulated to 3.1 million ENA on August 15 after the altcoin started to correct, a testament that the Ethena price bull run is not over yet. ENA Price Analysis: Is Ethena Going to Zero? The bull run may not be over just yet, with ENA flashing a potential cup-and-handle on the daily chart, a classic bullish continuation pattern. ENA / USDT 1-day chart, potential cup and handle reversal. Source: TradingView, Binance. The key breakout threshold sits at $0.85, the resistance that capped Ethena’s most recent rally. While Ethena has found support at the $0.68 0.618 Fibonacci level, a common bottom marker for sharp reversals, though momentum indicators are mixed. The RSI is holding above the neutral 52 zone, hinting that selling pressure may be cooling as bulls look to retake control. Yet, the MACD continues to widen below the signal line after a recent death cross, signaling that the downtrend still carries weight. If $0.68 is lost as support, the correction may extend to the next historical support level around $0.51 as the bottom for the handle. A credible scenario with the September FOMC meeting still 29 days away. Potential rate cuts remain distant, leaving ENA without a near-term catalyst for demand to halt the decline. When demand returns, a breakout opens the doors for a retest of the all-time high around $1.32, and a push into new price discovery targeting $3.25 for a potential 400% gain.

50335010,560082,1755605589,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50335010.jpeg,Cardano Prediction 2025: Gemini’s ADA Outlook & SUBBD Token Recommendation,https://bitcoinist.com/gemini-cardano-2025-prediction-subbd-token-recommendation/,"Not Bitcoin, not Ethereum, not even XRP; it’s Cardano ($ADA) that’s been making the loudest noise in the current rally. This utility-driven altcoin has just overtaken Dogecoin and Tron in market capitalization , securing its place as the 8th largest cryptocurrency in the world. $ADA is up over 40% since the start of the month , fueled largely by Bitcoin’s momentum and growing speculation around a potential Cardano ETF in 2025. On Polymarket, one of the largest prediction markets, participants now assign an 82% chance that the SEC will approve a Cardano ETF this year . Speaking of Cardano’s growth, we turned to Gemini, Google’s AI chatbot that pulls together every shred of online analysis (thanks to its Google Search integration) into a coherent picture of where $ADA may head next. Spoiler alert : Gemini predicts Cardano could have the legs to hit $3 (~210% returns from current levels) by the end of the year. Keep reading to uncover the single biggest technical factor behind Gemini’s $3 prediction, and how you can make the most of this move by loading up on SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) , a new utility-backed altcoin currently in presale. $ADA Technical Analysis: Major Breakout & Historical Data Suggests $3 Target Gemini’s $3 target for Cardano isn’t just speculation; it’s backed by two major technical patterns that point to strong bullish momentum in the current cycle. First, as you can see in the chart below, $ADA is on the verge of breaking out from a long-term descending channel (blue lines). The token has been consolidating within this range since December 2024, forming a textbook accumulation pattern. According to classical technical analysis, projecting the channel’s width onto the breakout gives us a target of around $2.50. This alone signals a significant move higher as Cardano leaves months of sideways action behind. Second, the black lines trace $ADA’s higher-high, higher-low rhythm, with the swing lows marking the two deep consolidations: the March-October 2024 downswing and the December 2024-July 2025 pullback, each roughly a 65% drawdown. With that market structure (HH-HL-HH) reasserting, the current recovery phase could extend Cardano’s next up-leg to just shy of the $3 mark. When you combine these technical signals with the macro backdrop – pro-crypto policy momentum from the GENIUS Act , expansion of crypto exposure in 401(k) retirement accounts , and the potential fuel of an approved Cardano ETF – the odds of $ADA breaking decisively above $3 by year-end rise substantially. In short, the charts and the fundamentals are beginning to align. From Cardano to SUBBD: The Next Utility-Driven Breakout Because $ADA is a utility token, powering decentralized apps, smart contracts, and secure, low-cost transactions, its rise carries more weight than that of a pure meme coin. Why? It signals that capital is flowing into projects with real-world substance, a trend that could spark a wider altcoin boom. Naturally, this also shifts investor attention toward other low-cap, high-potential tokens that could ride Cardano’s momentum. When we asked Gemini to identify one altcoin with similar breakout potential, it had no hesitation in naming SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) as the next crypto to explode . According to the AI, SUBBD combines a revolutionary mission with early-stage momentum, making it a standout candidate in the current pro-utility rally. What Is SUBBD Token? $SUBBD is the native cryptocurrency of the SUBBD content creation platform, which introduces innovative mechanisms for modern creators to better engage with their audiences. Today, the $85B content creation industry is plagued by excessive platform fees, with some taking up to 70% of creator revenues. On top of that, creators often face arbitrary bans and sudden payout blockages that put their livelihoods at risk. SUBBD aims to change that while adding meaningful utility for industry participants. The platform integrates AI-powered tools for content creation, including automated text, voice, and video generation, enabling creators to produce engaging content faster and with less effort. This then frees up more time for creators to connect with their audience and build loyal fan bases. In addition, SUBBD charges only a fraction of the typical platform fees, allowing creators to keep far more of their hard-earned income. Why Hold $SUBBD? Holding $SUBBD allows fans to experience the platform as it’s truly meant to be, unlocking a wide range of exclusive benefits and interactions with their favorite creators. For starters, you can request personalized content from your favorite creators, tip them directly in cryptocurrency, and access exclusive premium content and platform experiences that aren’t available to regular users. What’s more, token holders also enjoy early access to beta features and voting rights on key platform decisions such as creator onboarding, ensuring the community has a direct say in the platform’s evolution. Another standout feature is SUBBD’s fixed-rate staking program, which offers 20% returns in the first year. Even better? Stakers also gain access to additional perks, including exclusive livestreams, behind-the-scenes (BTS) content, and platform points that can be redeemed for further rewards. Why Should You Buy $SUBBD Now? Unlike Cardano, the market has yet to factor in $SUBBD’s true potential. The project is still in its presale stage, meaning it hasn’t yet listed on major exchanges. This gives you the unique opportunity to become an early investor and see the greatest upside. $SUBBD’s presale has already been a blockbuster, having already accumulated over $1M in early investor funding, with each token currently available for just $0.056225. The best part? According to our $SUBBD price prediction , the token could reach $0.301 by the end of 2025 – a potential return of over 430% for those who buy in at today’s price. Interested? Here’s our complete guide on how to buy $SUBBD . For more information, visit SUBBD Token’s official website. Wrapping Up With one of the most mainstream utility-backed tokens, Cardano, looking like a million bucks, breaking out of key technical patterns and eyeing nearly 200% returns, it’s no surprise that crypto degens are hungry for more from this rally. That’s why attention is shifting toward low-cap, high-potential, utility-driven tokens like SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) , which combine a revolutionary mission with surging investor hype (already raising over $1M in its presale).

The market is led by Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC), with other players including USDe, DAI, and FDUSD (see Exhibit 1). This growth has been fuelled by their stability — pegged to the U.S. dollar — and their ability to function as digital cash within the blockchain ecosystem. The passage of the first federal stablecoin legislation on July 17 has also accelerated adoption. With regulation in place, U.S. banks are beginning to explore launching their own stablecoins, notes the agency. “Stablecoins offer efficiency and innovation in the financial system, but they also pose both opportunities and risks for banks,” Morningstar DBRS analysts wrote in a report published Tuesday. How Stablecoins Work: Cheaper, Faster, Smarter Money Morningstar explains stablecoins are designed to combine the reliability of fiat currencies with the efficiency of blockchain. Unlike traditional payment rails — credit cards, ACH, or wire transfers — stablecoin transactions settle in seconds. “Stablecoins are programmable money,” Morningstar notes, highlighting their use in smart contracts that automatically execute financial operations. This has made them attractive for cross-border payments, e-commerce, and remittances. Major issuers like Tether, Circle, and PayPal back their coins with reserves of short-term U.S. Treasuries and cash equivalents, ensuring stability and redeemability. The efficiency advantage is stark: where wire transfers can cost up to $50 and take days to settle, stablecoins move instantly with negligible fees. This dynamic is drawing users away from banks’ legacy systems. Risks to U.S. Banks: Deposits and Payments at Stake Morningstar warns that the rise of stablecoins poses real risks to U.S. banks’ core business models. The most immediate concern is deposit flight. If consumers increasingly hold funds in stablecoins for rewards, convenience, or integration with decentralized finance, banks could lose the deposits that underpin their lending operations. According to the Bank for International Settlements, stablecoins still account for just 1.5% of total U.S. deposits, but growth is accelerating. “ A large-scale shift of funds from bank accounts into stablecoins could constrain banks’ ability to fund new loans or extend credit,” Morningstar analysts said. Banks also risk losing lucrative payment fees. Stablecoins bypass networks like ACH and SWIFT, enabling cheaper and faster transfers. As Exhibit 2 shows, the cost advantage is significant, threatening revenue from transaction services. Not All Bad News: A Path Forward for Banks Despite the risks, Morningstar highlights potential opportunities. Banks could leverage their regulatory credibility to serve as custodians of stablecoin reserves, manage U.S. Treasury holdings, and provide settlement and compliance infrastructure. These services could open new fee income streams. The newly passed GENIUS Act (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act) sets capital and reserve requirements for issuers, creating a more level playing field. Some banks are considering launching their own fully backed stablecoins, integrated into existing compliance systems, to retain deposits and stay competitive. “Whether stablecoins ultimately represent an opportunity or a threat to U.S. banks will depend on regulatory design and market adoption,” Morningstar concludes.

While the SEC delays rulings on new Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP funds, capital flows into Ethereum and speculation around Dogecoin ETFs are driving attention. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly named among the best altcoins to watch for 2025. SEC Delays on Truth Social Crypto ETFs Stir Market Interest The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has delayed decisions on several ETF applications tied to Truth Social, including Bitcoin and Ethereum funds, as well as proposed XRP and Litecoin ETFs. The next deadline has been set for October 8. While delays are standard procedure, they add intrigue to the market as institutional players await clarity. Truth Social’s filing has drawn extra scrutiny due to former President Donald Trump’s involvement in various crypto projects. Critics argue that approval could blur lines between politics and finance, though the SEC maintains it needs more time for evaluation. Despite the postponements, the broader ETF market continues to gain traction, with traders closely watching whether new crypto-based funds will secure approval later this year. Ethereum ETF Activity Dominates Capital Flows Ethereum exchange-traded products have seen inflows of $2.9 billion in just one week, outpacing Bitcoin despite BTC hitting new highs above $124,000. ETH’s trading volume in spot ETFs reached $17 billion across four days, setting a new record according to Bloomberg data. The growing demand for Ethereum products highlights investor appetite for altcoin exposure beyond Bitcoin. Ether’s price, hovering near $4,300, remains below its previous peak but is benefiting from heavy inflows and strong activity around institutional products. Analysts note that Ethereum’s position as the leading smart contract platform continues to make it a preferred choice among funds, adding weight to its status as one of the best buys for 2025 in the wake of crypto ETF news. Dogecoin Sees ETF Filing and Security Concerns Dogecoin is in the spotlight after Grayscale amended filings to convert its Dogecoin Trust into an ETF. If approved, DOGE would join Bitcoin and Ethereum with its own U.S.-listed spot ETF, a move that could expand institutional access. At the same time, concerns were raised as mining collective Qubic announced plans to target DOGE after previously disrupting Monero. Despite these threats, Dogecoin has defended the $0.22 level, suggesting resilience. The combination of ETF speculation and network developments keeps DOGE firmly on the radar for 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE Named Best Altcoin Buy for 2025 Alongside Ethereum and Dogecoin, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being singled out as one of the best buys for 2025. The altcoin combines meme appeal with practical DeFi applications, all within a transparent and security-first framework. Analysts highlight it as a hedge against slower-moving assets, with forecasts ranging from 35x to 15,000x upside. With market participants increasingly turning to MAGACOIN FINANCE, urgency around entry is building. Its ongoing growth has sparked comparisons to earlier breakouts, but with a stronger structure and verified security. For those seeking exposure to a rising altcoin ahead of broader listings, MAGA is being positioned as a top contender. Takeaway Crypto ETF news continues to influence market behavior, with Ethereum and Dogecoin benefiting from inflows and filings. Yet, the conversation around 2025 best buys now includes MAGACOIN FINANCE, an altcoin attracting growing attention. For investors eyeing early opportunities, exploring MAGACOIN’s ecosystem may prove timely. Access MAGACOIN FINANCE via the official website.

Don’t Bet On DOGE & PEPE to 10x From Here,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/can-the-biggest-runner-this-cycle-be-this-ai-coin-dont-bet-on-doge-pepe-to-10x-from-here/,"The Dogecoin ETF possibility triggered optimism, but it failed to build a sustainable momentum around DOGE. Similarly, the massive PEPE price drop questions its future outlook. Therefore, crypto experts have found an AI coin named Unilabs Finance that is speculated to offer massive gains. Analysts warns against investing in meme-based tokens like DOGE and PEPE as they could not offer 10x gains. Meanwhile, this AI-powered protocol promises stable growth with its presale power and growth potential. DOGE Struggles to Hold Ground Despite Grayscale Dogecoin ETF Filing In the last seven days, the DOGE token made a huge comeback by trading above $0.24 after the Dogecoin ETF’s possible approval. However, this comeback was soon met with correction as the token dropped to $0.22. Source: CoinMarketCap On August 15, Grayscale Investments filed for a spot Dogecoin ETF under the ticker GDOG with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Additionally, other firms like Bitwise and Rex-Osprey have also applied for a Dogecoin ETF proposal. This institutional interest in the DOGE token prompted a false breakout in the Dogecoin price. On top of this, the recent announcement of the Qubic company to target the DOGE token next after the Monero attack has further contributed to the Dogecoin price drop. Despite the optimism around the Dogecoin ETF approval, DOGE is unable to gain momentum. Hence, experts advise investors not to bet on DOGE as it cannot offer 10x growth. On the other hand, a new AI coin, Unilabs Finance, is speculated to offer bigger potential in the upcoming cycle. PEPE Price Continuous Downtrend Paints a Bearish Outlook After rallying to $0.000014 in the previous month, PEPE price has experienced a massive drop of over 17% in the last 30 days. Despite a more than 80% surge in trading volume, Pepecoin continues to trend downward. Analysts are attributing this continuous drop in the PEPE price to the broader underperformance of the meme coin sector. As the Bitcoin dominance increases, the altcoin season index faces an extended decline. Source: CoinMarketCap From a technical perspective, the Pepecoin might face a further increase in selling pressure. While some whales are leveraging this dip in the PEPE price, investors are still unsure whether to invest in this meme coin or not. Considering the technical uncertainty around the PEPE price chart, analysts suggest investors not bet large capital as the token does not promise a clear direction in the near-term. Meanwhile, Unilabs Finance is winning investors’ trust with its smart AI features and strong fundamentals. Unilabs Finance: A Potential Top Gainer With AI Advancements Unilabs Finance is expected to be a potential biggest runner in the upcoming cycle with its AI advancements. Considering the DOGE’s false breakout after the Dogecoin ETF news and the PEPE price’s continuous downtrend, the experts believe investors should not expect 10x gains from these coins. On the other hand, Unilabs Finance could deliver 900% gains if it experiences a 10x surge from its current presale price to the projected $0.09 price. The reason behind such bold speculations is the increasing demand for this protocol due to its innovative features, like AI Market Pulse. With this tool, investors could get a comprehensive picture of the ongoing market dynamics, such as the Dogecoin ETF updates and the PEPE price movements. Similarly, its Early Access Scoring System enables investors to find potential emerging investment projects that have already been audited for their credibility. Likewise, the meme coin identification tool of the platform gives users the chance to invest in meme coins with massive growth potential. In addition, the platform also boasts four different categories of funding options, including AI, BTC, RWA, and Mining funds. By utilizing this functionality, investors could diversify their investment portfolio in accordance with modern DeFi. Some other driving factors behind Unilabs Finance ’s high-growth potential: A massive $13.7 million presale. Over 1.9 billion tokens sold. An impressive 40% bonus with the code UNIL40. With stage 6 almost finished, last chance to buy UNIL at just $0.009. While meme-based tokens do offer sudden hype-driven gains, Unilabs Finance stable growth with enhanced utility that could bridge the gap between traditional and decentralized finance. As DOGE and PEPE do not promise any potential breakout, experts advice to invest in UNIL right now for better upside.

Despite Bitcoin’s recent pullback, the ETF giant has reaffirmed its bold call that $BTC will reach $180K before the year is out. It’s a striking stance at a time when sentiment looks shaky, but VanEck’s track record in crypto research gives the prediction weight. When institutions stay bullish, it often signals that long-term demand is alive and well, even if the short-term chart looks messy. That kind of conviction can steady nerves and refocus attention on where the market could be heading next. And naturally, it’s putting fresh eyes on projects tied to Bitcoin’s future utility, like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) . VanEck’s Bold Call on $BTC VanEck’s latest ChainCheck report , released mid-August, lays out why the firm is confident $BTC still has room to run – all the way to $180K by year’s end, marking around a 56% move from today’s price of $115K . The analysis highlights several supportive factors, starting with steady institutional inflows. Corporate adoption has been a major pillar of Bitcoin’s resilience, with treasuries continuing to allocate even through recent dips. On-chain data also paints a bullish picture, with 92% of holdings sitting in profit before the last local high. Mining remains robust too, despite difficulty reaching new peaks. Revenues are holding up, and the US mining sector is consolidating its global share, giving the market a stronger foundation. VanEck does, of course, acknowledge risks – Ethereum has been pulling in sizable institutional flows, Ordinals usage has plummeted, and treasury dynamics could amplify volatility if capital rotation slows. Still, the firm doubled down on its $180K year-end $BTC prediction. With Bitcoin’s August 14th ATH of around $124,457 , it’s a lofty but not impossible target. Institutional Strength and the Next Phase for Bitcoin VanEck’s optimism ultimately rests on one truth: Bitcoin is no longer just retail speculation – it’s being steered by deep-pocketed institutions. Corporate treasuries holding $BTC bring legitimacy and dampen wild price swings, but they also reshape the market’s rhythm. Lower volatility is good for stability, yet it can starve the system of the sharp capital rotations that once drove retail manias. At the same time, mining tells its own story. US operators are centralizing hashrate, scaling revenues even as difficulty peaks, and professionalizing what was once a fragmented sector. For investors, the signal is clear: Bitcoin is maturing into an institutional-grade asset. But that maturity also highlights its flaws. Namely, speed and cost. If $BTC is heading for $180K this year – and beyond that in the years ahead – it needs better rails, and that’s where Bitcoin Hyper makes its case. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Scaling the $BTC Narrative How will Bitcoin actually function in a world of mass adoption? The base layer is too slow and too expensive for high-volume usage, which is why Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) has been gaining traction as the so-called ‘execution layer’ for Bitcoin. $HYPER’s presale has already pulled in $10.6M+, with tokens priced at $0.012755 and offering a hefty 103% APY for stakers. We believe the project could reach a token price of $1.5 by 2030, marking an 11,660% increase from its current presale price. For more insights on $HYPER’s future potential, check out our full Bitcoin Hyper price prediction . The pitch is straightforward: Bitcoin Hyper brings Solana-style scalability to Bitcoin via the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) . That means sub-second transactions, near-zero fees, and a playground for DeFi, dApps, and meme coins – but secured by Bitcoin’s monetary base. For investors, it’s a natural complement. If Bitcoin is destined to appreciate, projects that unlock its utility could absorb outsized value. Technically, Hyper isn’t a side chain. It’s a full Layer-2 with zero-knowledge proof settlement, allowing $BTC to be bridged in trustlessly, used in lightning-fast apps, and withdrawn back to Bitcoin’s Layer-1 when needed. Built cross-chain from the start, its $HYPER token taps into the Ethereum and Solana ecosystems too.And culturally, it leans hard into crypto’s chaotic heart: memes, DAOs, and degen tooling. That blend of serious scalability and community-first branding explains why $HYPER’s presale can resonate with both retail punters and institutional observers keeping tabs on the next wave of Bitcoin infrastructure. Learn more about this project → What is Bitcoin Hyper? A Full Guide . Final Thoughts – Bitcoin’s Future and the Hyper Bet VanEck’s $180K price target shows that even in a bearish stretch, heavyweight institutions still see Bitcoin’s trajectory pointing higher. That kind of conviction is rare, and it’s keeping sentiment alive when retail confidence might otherwise waver. Against that backdrop, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself as more than just a meme-fueled presale. By merging Bitcoin’s brand power with Solana-grade speed and scalability, it’s trying to solve one of crypto’s oldest problems: making $BTC actually usable. That said, $HYPER remains an early-stage bet. This article is not financial advice.

In a post on X on August 19, Bodily said the team had made “really good” progress across multiple fronts, including frozen funds, external audits and platform cleanup. However, he added that trading will only restart once the following three key conditions are met: Verification of user balances Audit completion Removal of illegitimate trading activity Frozen funds and ongoing investigations Bodily confirmed that “funds have been frozen in various CEXs/tokens” and that Odin.fun is working with authorities to track down individuals tied to the exploit and recover user assets. The project is also partnering with undisclosed firms to ensure that when trading resumes, user deposits are backed 1:1 on the platform. “We’re working with a few partners to ensure user funds are backed 1:1 in the platform prior to reopening trading. We’re hoping this is finalized in the next few days,” Bodily wrote. The latest update follows earlier reports that attackers drained 58.2 BTC (worth about $7 million) from Odin.fun by exploiting a flaw in its liquidity AMM mechanism. The exploit was first called out by a member of the Odin.fun community via an X post. Bodily confirmed the incident, announcing the suspension of deposits and halt trading as of August 12. In a later post, Bodily stated that malicious users with links to groups in China were behind the exploit, adding that they are working with US law enforcement. He also said that Binance and OKX are helping with the investigation on the Chinese front, along with the relevant authorities. Odin.fun hack audit close to completion Another focus of the recovery process is a comprehensive security audit. Bodily said the team was “really close to finishing audit fixes,” after which the updated code will be resubmitted to the auditor. The final report will be made public before any trading resumes. This is consistent with Odin.fun’s earlier commitments to transparency. The team is also in the process of cleaning up the trading history. According to Bodily, Odin.fun is working to “remove illegitimate trading while maintaining legitimate user trading,” an attempt to isolate fraudulent transactions linked to the exploit without erasing genuine activity. Still, the timeline for completion remains uncertain as Bodily said, “We still aren’t exactly sure when we can resume trading,” pointing to the need to finalize user balances, audit results and platform cleanup first. A promise to bounce back Despite the prolonged freeze, the Odin.fun community has remained supportive. Bodily praised creators, developers, and users across multiple crypto ecosystems who have offered help. “I know it sounds cliché, but I have no doubt Odin.fun is going to come back stronger than ever,” he wrote. The incident has drawn wider attention in Bitcoin DeFi circles, given that Odin.fun positioned itself as a novel experiment at the intersection of memes and decentralized finance. Its growth prior to the exploit highlighted both the appetite for innovation on Bitcoin rails and the persistent security risks faced by emerging protocols.

At this point, Chainlink gained around 20% in the past week before the general decline and is currently trading around $25. This move for LINK occurred after breaking through the critical resistance zone between $20 and $21. This resistance zone had been rejected multiple times since the beginning of 2025. Analyzing this rise of Cahainlink, Santiment stated that LINK continues to be a strong force in the altcoin world, rising above $26 for the first time in seven months. At this point, Santiment said that on-chain data shows an increase in whale activity, known as large investors. According to the data, whale wallets have added over 1.1 million LINK addresses worth approximately $27 million in the last seven days, increasing their holdings by over 12% during the same period. While Santiment highlights LINK’s impressive rise, whales are not sitting idle either. According to Lookonchain's post, a giant whale, which has increased its LINK purchases in recent days, has made a new purchase from Binance. Accordingly, the whale with the address 0x4EBD purchased another 249,808 LINK worth $6 million, bringing its total purchase in the last 4 days to 1,293,757 LINK ($31.15 million). https://x.com/lookonchain/status/1957673941864009816 *This is not investment advice.

The firm, led by investor Grant Cardone, recently acquired 130 Bitcoin (BTC), as reported by Bitcoin Magazine on X. This strategic acquisition is a clear indicator of growing institutional interest in cryptocurrencies, particularly Cardone Capital Bitcoin investments, from sectors previously considered traditional. What is Cardone Capital’s Bitcoin Strategy? This recent Cardone Capital Bitcoin acquisition is not an isolated event but rather part of a larger, deliberate strategy.

Diversification: By allocating a portion of its fund to Bitcoin, Cardone Capital aims to diversify its asset holdings beyond traditional real estate. Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin is often viewed as a potential hedge against inflation, offering a different kind of store of value compared to physical properties.

The convergence of real estate and cryptocurrencies, exemplified by Cardone Capital’s Bitcoin move, is gaining momentum.

Several factors contribute to this growing interest: Accessibility and Liquidity: Bitcoin offers unparalleled liquidity compared to real estate, allowing for quicker asset conversion. Technological Advancement: Blockchain technology, underpinning Bitcoin, promises more efficient and transparent property transactions in the future. Global Reach: Bitcoin transcends geographical boundaries, potentially opening real estate investments to a wider, international pool of crypto-savvy investors. Moreover, the increasing acceptance of cryptocurrencies by mainstream financial institutions provides a more secure and regulated environment for such investments. The Broader Impact of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption When a prominent entity like Cardone Capital makes a substantial Cardone Capital Bitcoin purchase, it sends a powerful signal to the market. This kind of institutional adoption lends significant credibility to the entire cryptocurrency space. It shifts the narrative from speculative trading to legitimate, long-term investment strategies. The ripple effect could be substantial: Increased Mainstream Acceptance: More traditional firms may follow suit, accelerating crypto’s integration into global finance. Enhanced Market Stability: Large, strategic holdings by institutions can contribute to greater price stability over time. Regulatory Clarity: As more regulated entities engage with crypto, there’s a greater likelihood of clearer regulatory frameworks emerging. This ongoing trend underscores Bitcoin’s evolution from a niche digital asset to a recognized component of diversified investment portfolios. What Does This Mean for Investors? For both seasoned and new investors, Cardone Capital’s Bitcoin strategy offers valuable insights. It highlights the potential for innovative investment approaches that blend traditional and digital assets. Here are some actionable takeaways: Consider Diversification: Explore how digital assets might fit into your own investment portfolio, aligning with your risk tolerance. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of how traditional industries are integrating cryptocurrencies. This trend can reveal new opportunities. Long-Term View: Institutional moves often reflect a long-term perspective on asset value, moving beyond short-term market fluctuations. The Cardone Capital Bitcoin acquisition reinforces the idea that digital assets are becoming an integral part of sophisticated investment strategies. Cardone Capital’s recent acquisition of 130 Bitcoin marks a pivotal moment, showcasing a bold integration of digital assets within a traditional real estate framework. This move is more than just a purchase; it’s a strategic declaration about the future of finance, where the lines between conventional and digital investments continue to blur. As more institutional players recognize the inherent value and potential of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin’s role as a legitimate, long-term asset class becomes increasingly solidified. This evolution is truly exciting for the entire financial world. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: How much Bitcoin did Cardone Capital recently purchase?

The sales triggered a pullback, causing the cryptocurrency to slip just barely above key support levels at $115,000. Additional selling pressure is likewise coming from long-term holders, who have also begun cashing out and thus amplifying the downside potential, as per CryptoQuant data on August 19. Coin Days Destroyed chart. Source: CryptoQuant Will Bitcoin drop to $100k? Bitcoin was trading at $115,553 at the time of writing, having seen a modest daily gain of 0.45% but still being down 2.5% on the weekly chart. As things stand, the world’s largest cryptocurrency risks further losses if selling continues, as a drop below $115,000 could send the price toward $112,500, with a deeper slide potentially testing $110,000. Further headwinds are generated by major Bitcoin ETF issuers trimming their holdings . For instance, Ark 21Shares offloaded 559.85 BTC, worth roughly $64.4 million, while BlackRock cut 490 BTC, valued at $68.7 million. Though in and of themselves small relative to the funds’ overall portfolios, the moves are coming just as the “digital gold’s” dominance triggered a Death Cross , a technical signal often associated with capital rotation out of BTC. Overall, the sales coincide with generally fragile crypto market conditions marked by weakening liquidity , so the question remains whether the recent moves are merely tactical rebalancing strategies driven by macroeconomic developments or more serious symptoms of changing institutional attitudes.
