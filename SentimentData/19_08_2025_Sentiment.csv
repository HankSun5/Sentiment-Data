Why Analysts Compare MAGACOIN FINANCE to Early SHIBA INU Growth,https://timestabloid.com/1000x-potential-why-analysts-compare-magacoin-finance/,"In 2021, Shiba Inu (SHIB) stunned the world with historic gains, turning a meme coin into a multi-billion-dollar ecosystem almost overnight. Now in 2025, crypto analysts are eyeing a new contender: MAGACOIN FINANCE —a rising altcoin in presale that some believe could deliver 1000x returns , just like SHIB did in its early days. While Shiba Inu works to evolve from speculation to real utility, MAGACOIN FINANCE is entering the market with momentum, community energy, and a scalable roadmap—sparking comparisons to SHIB’s breakout phase . Let’s break down what’s happening with SHIB, and why MAGACOIN FINANCE may be one of the best altcoins to buy in 2025 for exponential gains. Shiba Inu Faces Technical Hurdles — But Remains Long-Term Focused Shiba Inu finds itself at a crossroads. One of the signals that the technical analysts gave on August 18, 2025, is the emergence of a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern on their charts. Besides the pattern, the data showed that the number of new wallet addresses was decreasing and that the TVL (Total Value Locked) for Shibarium had dropped by 95%. Besides this, the activity of the whales has also decreased considerably, which is indicative of the lack of strength in the market for the near future. Key Issues: Potential 20% downside if SHIB breaks below $0.00001027. Whale and retail engagement dropping amid macro uncertainty. Bearish sentiment despite solid community size. However, SHIB’s development team is actively working to improve fundamentals: A new developer hub launched on Mintlify to attract builders. Shibarium still handles 4M daily transactions, showing ongoing network use. Over 264 million addresses have been created on Shibarium to date. ShibDAO governance, RPC improvements, and DeFi SDKs have been implemented to improve the ecosystem. SHIB’s perspective for quite a while is positive; however, a lot of investors are beginning to ask themselves whether the next 1000x project will be in another place. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Why Analysts See 1000x Upside Potential The current presale of MAGACOIN FINANCE offers ultra-low entry prices , echoing SHIB’s earliest moments—before its breakout to billions in market cap. Analysts say that if the coin maintains this pace of adoption and hits mainstream exchanges, a 1000x return isn’t just hype—it’s possible , particularly if sentiment shifts in its favor during the next bull run. SHIB proved it was possible with its historic run in 2021, and now MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining attention for its strong community, early-stage momentum, and low entry price—offering similar high-reward potential. Most investors wish they had gotten into SHIB before the hype. But many waited for confirmation—by then, 90% of the gains were already priced in. With MAGACOIN FINANCE , investors are still early. The project is: In presale at a steep discount. Gaining momentum with retail and viral interest. Backed by a vision to combine meme culture with real-world financial tools . If you missed SHIB’s rocket ride, this may be your next best shot. Final Thoughts While Shiba Inu evolves into a Layer-2 project with real DeFi utility, the days of 1000x gains from SHIB may be behind us. But MAGACOIN FINANCE is still in its earliest stages —just as SHIB was when only the boldest believed in its potential. With meme energy, strategic utility, and low presale pricing , MAGACOIN FINANCE is fast becoming one of the most talked-about early-stage cryptos of 2025. If history repeats—or even rhymes—this could be the next great crypto success story.

50308367,559080,1755558048,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50308367.jpeg,$500M Liquidations Rock Ethereum and Bitcoin: Is the Crash Fueling Whale Accumulation?,https://bitcoinist.com/500m-liquidations-rock-ethereum-and-bitcoin-crash/,"The crypto market faced a brutal correction on Monday, with nearly $500 million in liquidations rattling traders across Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). According to CoinGlass data, over 115,000 traders were liquidated as Bitcoin slipped to $115,000 and Ethereum plunged toward the $4,200 danger zone. The cascade was fueled by high leverage exposure, creating a domino effect of forced selling across exchanges. Bitcoin’s sharp drop erased more than $3,000 in value within hours, pulling major altcoins into the red. ETH fell nearly 5%, while Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE) each dropped 4–5%. XRP tested the critical $3 support level, underscoring the market-wide fragility. Interestingly, Chainlink (LINK) bucked the trend, posting a daily 5% gain despite the turmoil. Ethereum Faces a Liquidation Cliff Ethereum appears particularly vulnerable if its price breaks below $4,200. Data from Hyperdash shows that more than 56,000 ETH long positions, worth about $236 million, sit at risk of liquidation near $4,170. Additional liquidation clusters are positioned around $3,940 and $2,150–$2,160, levels that could amplify volatility if triggered. Andrew Kang, founder of Mechanism Capital, warned that ETH could fall as low as $3,600 if the liquidation cascade continues. He added that overall ETH liquidations across exchanges could reach $5 billion, potentially driving prices even lower before stabilizing. Bitcoin Whale Accumulation or General Market Breakdown? Despite the sell-off, some analysts argue the crash may be setting up a whale accumulation phase. Crypto analyst CrypNuevo noted that Bitcoin recently printed a new all-time high before a sudden $1 billion liquidation event, a move he believes was engineered to flush out retail traders. He suggested that one whale absorbed much of the forced selling, signaling that institutional players may be scooping up BTC at discounted prices. If whales are indeed accumulating, the dip could serve as a springboard for the next rally once leveraged positions reset and selling pressure eases. However, with geopolitical uncertainty and fragile support levels, traders should remain cautious. The coming days will determine whether Bitcoin stabilizes above $115,000 and Ethereum holds $4,200, or if another wave of liquidations drags the market deeper into correction.

However, it is advised to do your own research and conduct expert opinion before investing in the volatile crypto market. Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Source: Coinmarketcap Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana’s (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150. In May the price continued to rise and ended the month above the $165 price level, a trend that could not extend through June as the month saw a decline falling below the $150 price level to end the month. July saw a sharp rise to the asset’s volatility with SOL crossing the $200 mark. However, the price could not be maintained and SOL ended the month below the $180 level.",Crypto Price Predictions|Solana,EN,0,0,SOL|TRADING|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-18 23:10:00

50306832,https://timestabloid.com/?p=79136,1755559217,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,SEC Delays Decision on Grayscale Spot XRP ETF. Here’s New Timeline,https://timestabloid.com/sec-delays-decision-on-grayscale-spot-xrp-etf-heres-new-timeline/,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has delayed its decision on the application to list and trade shares of the Grayscale XRP Trust as a spot XRP exchange-traded fund. The application was initially submitted by NYSE Arca on January 30, 2025, with an amendment filed on February 10 . Following these submissions, the amended proposal was published in the Federal Register on February 20, which marked the beginning of the SEC’s review process. On March 11, the Commission extended the review period, and by May 20, it issued an Order Instituting Proceedings to allow for further analysis and additional public comments. This order did not signal approval or rejection; it reflects the need for a deeper examination of whether the exchange’s proposal aligns with the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act, including provisions designed to prevent fraud, manipulation, and to protect investors. SEC’s Reason for Delay Under the Securities Exchange Act, the SEC is required to decide within 180 days after publishing a proposed rule change. However, it can extend it by an additional 60 days if more time is deemed necessary. In its most recent notice on August 18, 2025, the Commission announced that it was exercising this option, extending the deadline for action to October 18, 2025. The agency explained that this extension was appropriate to provide more time for thorough consideration of the filing and the issues raised in the record. This decision aligns with the Commission’s approach to similar digital asset ETF applications, where delays are common as part of the standard review process. By pushing the deadline forward, the SEC has given itself until mid-October to issue a final approval or disapproval of the Grayscale proposal. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Outlook for October The delay does not alter the substance of the application but indicates that the SEC will use the full timeframe allowed under law before making its decision. Between now and the new deadline, the Commission will continue reviewing whether the safeguards and structures proposed by NYSE Arca and Grayscale adequately address investor protection standards and market integrity requirements. As of now, the Grayscale spot XRP ETF remains pending and has not received approval. Trading on NYSE Arca cannot proceed unless the Commission issues a favorable order. The October 18, 2025, deadline represents the final statutory date for action, meaning the SEC must either approve or reject the proposal at that time. Until then, the application remains under review, with the outcome depending on the Commission’s assessment of the full record.

50307322,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=787175,1755559265,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50307322.jpeg,Texas is investigating Meta and Character.ai for marketing chatbots as therapists,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/meta-and-character-ai-face-investigation/,"Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has opened an inquiry into Meta and Character.ai on whether the tech firms promote their chatbots as mental health experts and therapists without proper qualifications. In a statement on Monday, Paxton’s office stated it is examining Meta and Character.AI over possible “deceptive trade practices.” The office argued that the chatbots have been marketed as “professional therapeutic tools, despite lacking proper medical credentials or oversight.” “By posing as sources of emotional support, AI platforms can mislead vulnerable users, especially children, into believing they’re receiving legitimate mental healthcare,” Paxton mentioned. The move lands as consumer-facing AI products face rising questions about how well they protect vulnerable users, and minors in particular, from harmful or graphic material, the risk of compulsive use, and privacy lapses tied to the large volumes of data needed to train and run these systems. Texas’s action follows a separate Senate inquiry into Meta reported by Cryptopolitan earlier on Friday, after internal leaked files suggested the company’s rules allowed its chatbot to engage in “romantic” and “sensual” conversations with users under 18. Senator Josh Hawley told Zuckerberg in a letter that the Senate will probe into the possibility of the tech firm’s generative AI tools enabling harm to children. “Is there anything — ANYTHING — Big Tech won’t do for a quick buck?” Hawley wrote on X. Is there anything – ANYTHING – Big Tech won’t do for a quick buck? Now we learn Meta’s chatbots were programmed to carry on explicit and “sensual” talk with 8 year olds. It’s sick. I’m launching a full investigation to get answers. Big Tech: Leave our kids alone pic.twitter.com/Ki0W94jWfo — Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) August 15, 2025 Meta says that its policies ban harm to children Meta said that its policies ban content that harms children in such ways. It added that Reuters first reported the “internal materials” leaked, which “were and are erroneous and inconsistent with our policies, and have been removed.” Zuckerberg has committed billions toward building “personal superintelligence” and positioning Meta as an “AI leader.” The company has released its Llama family of LLMs and rolled out the Meta chatbot across its social apps. Zuckerberg also described a potential therapeutic use case for the technology. “For people who don’t have a person who’s a therapist, I think everyone will have an AI,” he said in a podcast with Ben Thompson in May. Character.ai makes chatbots with distinct personas and lets users design their own. The platform includes many user-created therapist-like bots. One bot, called “Psychologist,” has recorded over 200 million interactions. The company has also been named in lawsuits brought by families who claim their children were harmed in the real world after using the service. Paxton’s office mentioned that Character.ai and Meta chatbots may impersonate licensed health professionals and invent new credentials, making it seem like the interactions are confidential, even though the companies themselves mention that all conversations get logged. These conversations are also “exploited for targeted advertising and algorithmic development,” Paxton’s office said. Paxton’s office issued a Civil Investigative Demand The attorney general has issued a Civil Investigative Demand requiring the companies to provide information that could show whether they violated laws related to Texas consumer protection. Meta said it marks AI experiences clearly and warns users about limitations. The company added, “We include a disclaimer that responses are generated by AI — not people. These AIs aren’t licensed professionals and our models are designed to direct users to seek qualified medical or safety professionals when appropriate.” Similarly, Character.ai said it uses prominent notices as a reminder that AI personas are not real and should not be viewed as professionals. “The user-created Characters on our site are fictional, they are intended for entertainment, and we have taken robust steps to make that clear,” the company said. The dual struggles, a state probe in Texas and a Senate review in Washington, place fresh pressure on how AI chatbots are built, marketed, and moderated, and on what companies tell users about the limits of automated support.

Ethereum and HBAR remain staples for steady growth, while MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining traction as a hidden presale contender with explosive upside potential. Together with Solana, Litecoin, and PEPE, these tokens form a list of seven cryptos analysts believe are well-positioned for high-multiple returns in the next cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE — Breakout Presale Contender Ethereum and HBAR are strongholds, but analysts say MAGACOIN FINANCE could outperform with 35x growth potential . Its combination of scarcity-driven tokenomics and accelerating whale inflows is pushing MAGACOIN FINANCE onto analyst watchlists as one of 2025’s hottest early-stage opportunities. Already raising millions and with allocations running low, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly emerging as a presale standout for investors seeking high-multiple growth. Also Investors who use PATRIOT50X can secure a 50% EXTRA presale bonus, available for a short time on the platform. Ethereum (ETH) — Market Leader Despite Selloffs Ethereum is currently priced at $4,375.53, down 2.23% in the last 24 hours after facing aggressive selling pressure. Over the past day, ETH has traded in a range between $4,227 and $4,484, reflecting volatility fueled by significant liquidations as investors line up to unstake tokens. Despite these short-term headwinds, Ethereum maintains a market cap above $526 billion, underlining its strength as the second-largest cryptocurrency. Analysts emphasize that while ETH may see near-term fluctuations, its long-term outlook remains intact thanks to strong institutional inflows, over 1.7 million daily transactions, and its critical role in powering DeFi and smart contracts. Hedera (HBAR) — Institutional Utility Play HBAR trades near $0.246, slightly lower after a 2% daily dip. Backed by enterprise-grade partnerships and an average 50-day price of $0.23, Hedera remains resilient even in volatile conditions. With its energy-efficient hashgraph technology and growing use cases in tokenization and payments, HBAR continues to attract institutional adoption, making it a compelling long-term hold. Solana (SOL) — Ecosystem Resilience Solana trades at around $185 following a 3% daily decline but remains well-supported above its 50-day average of $172. With strong DeFi activity, NFT adoption, and upcoming ETF decisions drawing institutional attention, Solana continues to be one of the most watched long-term plays in the market. Litecoin (LTC) — The Veteran Performer Litecoin remains steady at $118, trading within a stable range and comfortably above its 50-day average of $106. As one of the longest-standing cryptocurrencies, LTC is known for its reliability and liquidity, providing a consistent option for investors seeking stability within a diversified portfolio. Shiba Inu (SHIB) — Community-Driven Growth Shiba Inu remains one of the most recognized meme coins, supported by an expansive community and ongoing ecosystem upgrades. Its currently trading around $0.00001267 and its move into Shibarium, its Layer-2 scaling solution, has given it a utility-driven narrative beyond meme status. As adoption grows and token burns accelerate, SHIB is being positioned as a long-term meme asset with significant upside potential. PEPE — Meme Coin with Staying Power PEPE trades around $0.00001067 with over $600 million in daily trading volume, underscoring its continued relevance. Despite volatility, PEPE’s community-driven momentum and liquidity profile make it a speculative but viable addition for long-term investors looking to capture meme coin cycles. Conclusion — Building a Balanced Portfolio Ethereum, with its $526 billion market cap and central role in DeFi, remains the anchor for institutional portfolios. HBAR offers enterprise utility, Solana brings ecosystem growth, Litecoin delivers veteran stability, and PEPE captures speculative upside. But among these, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly highlighted as the hidden gem with 35x potential , making it a strategic addition for investors seeking outsized returns in the 2025 cycle.

The satellite internet service run by Elon Musk’s SpaceX stopped working for thousands of users on Monday night. Reports poured in through Downdetector , the go-to platform for tracking tech outages. Users across the globe said their connections just dropped out, no warning, nothing. Starlink already had a major blackout just two weeks ago, dragging on for hours. According to SpaceX VP of Starlink Engineering Michael Nicolls, it happened because of a “failure of key internal software services that operate the core network.” No updates were shared this time, at least not by press time. SpaceX sends more satellites up as California pushes back That July 24 crash hit right after T-Mobile launched its new Starlink-based service. The carrier promised direct-to-cell connectivity for areas with no signal at all. According to T-Mobile, this new setup should work “in places no carrier towers can reach.” It’s supposed to let phones connect straight to the satellite system without any ground infrastructure. Starlink currently serves over six million users in 140 countries, according to SpaceX’s own website. But the company doesn’t publish any numbers about how many users stick around or how many leave. That means nobody outside SpaceX really knows how stable or profitable the customer base is. What is public, though, is the sheer size of the Starlink fleet. Research from astronomer Jonathan McDowell shows that more than 7,000 broadband satellites are actively working in orbit right now. That’s way more than any other company trying to do the same thing. And SpaceX isn’t stopping. On the same day users were facing problems, SpaceX launched another group of Starlink satellites from Vandenberg Space Force Base in Southern California. The timing was almost too perfect, down on Earth, users were cut off from the internet In space, more satellites were flying out to join the constellation. According to the company’s plans, launches from Vandenberg are expected to double soon, from 50 to around 100 each year. But not everyone is on board. Last Thursday, the California Coastal Commission voted unanimously to block the U.S. Space Force’s application to allow SpaceX to ramp up those launches. The issue? Nobody has properly looked into what that kind of activity could do to the environment. The commission said SpaceX and the Space Force failed to submit reports about the impact of more launches on nearby communities and local wildlife. Noise, vibrations, chemical use; it all adds up. And they’re not willing to greenlight 100 launches a year without answers. This vote directly affects how quickly SpaceX can expand Starlink through Vandenberg. And while that drama was happening, another piece moved in Washington. Donald Trump signed an executive order to weaken environmental regulations that companies like SpaceX say are slowing them down. The new rule is meant to make it easier for commercial space firms to launch rockets without all the red tape. Whether that’ll help Elon in California remains to be seen, since state-level commissions don’t always bow to federal orders. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

The FIU said it will conduct stablecoin-related research via external contractors. It will then compile its findings in December this year before drafting a set of guidelines for stablecoin operators and issuers. Per The Bell Korea , the regulator is likely to recommend amendments to the Specific Financial Information Act, with “significant changes” in store. The South Korean National Assembly Building in Seoul, South Korea. (Source: National Assembly [KOGL Type 1]) South Korean Regulator Readies Stablecoin Regulations The regulator is likely to impose entry restrictions and business conduct regulations. Many of these will likely focus on the security of the assets that underpin any South Korean stablecoins, as well as data reporting criteria. An FIU official said that December’s research report would “serve as a foundation for developing AML response measures in response to changes in the virtual asset industry and the institutionalization of stablecoins.” The official added that the measures would help “improve and supplement the existing system.” The FIU currently plays a key role in policing domestic crypto exchanges and ensuring their AML compliance. And the reorganization appears to suggest it expects to become the top AML regulatory authority for stablecoin issuers, despite plans to scrap its parent organization, the Financial Services Commission (FSC). President Lee Jae-myung has previously announced his intention to do away with the FSC. He wants to merge its operations with those of the finance ministry and the Financial Supervisory Service. President Lee Jae Myung’s approval rating has dropped for the second straight week, sinking to a record low of 51.1 percent, a poll showed Monday. The slide comes amid growing controversy over his Liberation Day pardons. https://t.co/VYWndBDJoZ — The Korea JoongAng Daily (@JoongAngDaily) August 18, 2025 However, recent government plan announcements have made no further mention of scrapping the FSC . And the Blue House has even assigned it crypto-related tasks for 2025. FIU Set for Important Regulatory Role? The FIU’s plans, which involve conducting a study on international stablecoin regulations, appear to suggest the regulator expects to police the industry ahead of the rollout of legislation. Several stablecoin bills are on the agenda at the National Assembly. However, lawmakers are yet to fine-tune the details of these draft laws. They continue to deliberate matters like the possible launch of stablecoin lending services. Critics note that the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and other organizations have warned that stablecoin adoption can lead to increased money laundering risks. The Bell Korea noted that many countries, including the United States, have been “quick to develop countermeasures.” Conversely, it noted, South Korea, is a “latecomer,” in this regard, as it “still lacks a comprehensive system.” The media outlet also added that South Korea “still lacks a clear legal definition of stablecoins.” Thus far, most AML-related legislation (including the Special Financial Transactions Act) and regulations relate to exchanges and crypto wallet operators. Big Businesses Ready to Make Stablecoin Moves While lawmakers are yet to form a firm consensus on stablecoin legislation, both major parties agree that businesses should be allowed to issue or make use of KRW-pegged coins. The headquarters of the South Korean tech giant Naver. (Source: Maskkwon [CC BY-SA 4.0]) Some of the country’s biggest banks and tech firms have responded by registering stablecoin-related trademarks. Others have already launched dedicated stablecoin business units as they await the National Assembly’s green light.

The report, conducted in partnership with The Harris Poll, surveyed 615 developers in the US, South Korea, Norway, Finland, and Sweden in late June and early July. Most of the respondents said AI agents were easing the burden of repetitive or technical work, per the report . Forty-four percent said they were using agents to optimize content and process information at speed, enabling them to focus on more creative responsibilities. Ninety-four percent expect AI to bring down development costs in the long run, though nearly a quarter of the respondents said it remained difficult to quantify return on investment, particularly given the high upfront costs of integration. The video game industry is in crisis The relationship between video game developers and AI hasn’t exactly been rosy. Between 2022 and May 2025, more than 35,000 workers were laid off across the global games business, with large publishers such as Embracer Group, Electronic Arts, Unity, Microsoft , and Sony all cutting staff. According to industry trackers, it is the most sustained wave of job losses in the sector’s history. At Microsoft, which shed around 9,000 gaming jobs, workers and union organizers have accused management of prioritizing investment in AI initiatives over staff retention. In one highly controversial case, about 200 developers at King, the Activision Blizzard subsidiary known for Candy Crush, were reportedly replaced by AI tools they had helped design, sparking outrage among colleagues and industry peers. Unions have become increasingly vocal. Blizzard’s narrative design team last month voted to unionize, one week after workers on the Call of Duty franchise did the same. Opinions are divided on AI as industry ponders way forward While most developers in the Google study cited efficiency gains, most of them still agree that there are some gray areas that need better clarification. 63% of respondents expressed concern over data ownership, with questions unresolved about whether studios or creators hold rights to AI-generated content. The “State of the Game Industry” survey, published in January ahead of the Game Developers Conference, painted a more skeptical picture. It found that more than half of studios were already experimenting with generative AI, but nearly a third of respondents characterized its impact as negative. They warned of homogenized content, algorithmic bias, and potential job erosion. At July’s Develop conference in Brighton, panelists argued that human oversight remained essential to authenticity and inclusion in storytelling, stressing that AI tools should not replace lived experience or cultural nuance. For many workers, AI represents not only a technical shift but a profound restructuring of how games are made and who gets to make them. Unions are expected to expand as staff seek to safeguard pay and creative input. Meanwhile, investors and executives are betting that the cost savings promised by automation will outweigh legal, reputational, and cultural risks.

New installs on Google Play are consistently falling year over year. In July 2025, new installs of X on Google Play fell 44% year over year worldwide, while downloads from Apple’s App Store rose 15%, highlighting a widening gap between the two mobile platforms. TechCrunch reported that the slump on Android is dragging down the service’s overall momentum. Appfigures reports that total mobile downloads in July were down 26% from a year earlier. The picture had looked worse a month prior, when total installs were off by 35% year over year as Android downloads at the time had dropped by nearly half, at 49%. X’s Android app has long been seen as a problem point, with users complaining about crashes and instability. Nikita Bier, recently appointed as X’s head of product and known for growing teen-focused apps like Gas and TBH before selling them, has suggested that the company will tackle Android performance head-on. On X, Bier announced hiring for an “Android Dream Team” charged with rebuilding the Android client. He also said the iOS app just logged a record week for installs, a data point that underscored Apple-side momentum even as Android lagged. Where those missing Android users might be going is not apparent. Bluesky’s growth has cooled, and its Google Play app collected only 119,000 downloads in July, far below the millions who install X on iOS or Android in a typical month. Meta’s Threads, however, has been narrowing the gap with X in daily active users on mobile, suggesting some Android users may be shifting attention there. The reduced installs on Google Play are hurting X revenue Appfigures found that X generated $16.9 million in net revenue in July, down from $18.8 million in March 2025. July was slightly better than June’s $16.8 million, but the broader trend has been hard to ignore. Most of X’s overall revenue still comes from advertising rather than premium subscriptions sold inside the apps. Falling demand for Android likely explains part of the revenue pressure. Another factor is that Grok now offers its own stand-alone app, attracting users who previously paid for X subscriptions mainly to unlock AI features. Those customers may be switching to Grok directly. Appfigures said the July snapshot reflects performance across devices, giving a clear view of how Android and iOS are diverging. Musk’s SpaceX continues expansion despite setbacks Meanwhile, SpaceX’s Starlink service experienced a separate setback. The satellite internet network was reported down for users around the world, according to Downdetector, which flagged issues beginning at about 1:30 p.m. ET. Affected customers described sluggish speeds, drop-offs in connectivity, and, in many cases, total service blackouts. Despite the rough patch, expansion plans are still on the calendar. Cryptopolitan recently reported that SpaceX’s BTC holdings have crossed $1 billion, which is undoubtedly a win for the space firm. SpaceX has also listed Uzbekistan as a 2026 launch market for Starlink on the service’s website, pointing to a new foothold in Central Asia next year. And in a near-term move, Kazakhstan’s government has announced a start date for service. “Starting from 13 August 2025, Starlink will officially begin providing satellite internet services in the territory of the Republic of Kazakhstan.” the Ministry of Digital Development, Innovation and Aerospace Industry of Kazakhstan reported.

The OpenAI CEO told a few reporters in San Francisco that Donald Trump’s latest ban on advanced chips won’t stop China from pushing forward in artificial intelligence. According to CNBC, Sam met journalists over Mediterranean food in the Presidio and laid out how bad the situation really is. “I’m worried about China,” he said. He warned that this isn’t some race where one side pulls ahead and wins. “There’s inference capacity, where China probably can build faster,” Sam said. “There’s research, there’s product; a lot of layers to the whole thing.” He explained that the U.S. is focused on just one piece, blocking chip exports, while China is working on the entire stack. And despite growing controls, Sam doesn’t think any of it is actually helping. “My instinct is that doesn’t work,” he said when asked if fewer GPUs reaching China would be a win. Trump blocks chips, but Sam says the policy is failing Trump, now back in the White House, signed off on a full stop of high-end chip exports to China in April 2025. That went even further than the earlier rules from President Joe Biden, which had already added restrictions to slow China’s access to advanced AI hardware. Trump’s new policy stopped even modified chips, the ones designed to pass Biden’s rules, from going out. But just last week, Washington changed the rules again. Under a new deal, Nvidia and AMD can now sell certain “China-safe” chips again. But they have to give 15% of their China revenue from those sales to the U.S. government. Sam didn’t talk about that deal directly, but he made it clear that trying to manage AI progress through policy alone isn’t realistic. “You can export-control one thing, but maybe not the right thing… maybe people build fabs or find other workarounds,” he said. “I’d love an easy solution,” he added. “But my instinct is: That’s hard.” He made it clear that this isn’t just about the chips. Chinese firms are already working with their own suppliers like Huawei. The controls from Washington haven’t stopped China. If anything, they’ve made Chinese companies move faster. While the U.S. stays dependent on Nvidia and AMD, Chinese labs are building alternatives. China’s rise pushes OpenAI to release new models Sam said that China’s progress in AI also pushed OpenAI to start opening up its own models. For years, the company refused to release full models, choosing to lock everything behind APIs. But now, with China releasing more open tools like DeepSeek, OpenAI is changing direction. “It was clear that if we didn’t do it, the world was gonna head to be mostly built on Chinese open source models,” Sam said. “That was a factor in our decision, for sure. Wasn’t the only one, but that loomed large.” OpenAI just released two new models: gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b. These are its first open-weight models since GPT-2 dropped in 2019. The new ones aren’t fully open source, the training data and source code are still locked, but the weights are now public. That means developers can download and run them, even offline. The goal, Sam said, was to support people building locally-run coding agents. Sam admitted these models won’t blow anyone away. Some developers say they’re missing key features. He didn’t argue. The team built them for one thing only, he said, and if needs change, they’ll adjust. “If the kind of demand shifts in the world,” he said, “you can push it to something else.” Right now, OpenAI is the only major U.S. company going this route. Meta had gone open with its Llama models before, but CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently said they might stop. That puts OpenAI out front, at least for now, as Chinese labs keep releasing flexible tools that anyone can use. Sam once said that locking up models had put OpenAI “on the wrong side of history.” This new decision looks like an effort to fix that. But it’s also a way to keep developers inside OpenAI instead of losing them to Chinese labs offering more freedom.

No damage has been reported yet, but history suggests that extensive losses could occur once the harm has been done. Taking Over Control The cryptocurrency exchange Kraken has temporarily stopped Monero deposits to the platform due to the ongoing 51% attack against the privacy-focused blockchain. This attack is made possible when a single mining entity controls over 50% of the network’s hash rate (the computational power needed to validate transactions), allowing them to double-spend (i.e., unauthorized production and spending of money) and reorder transactions on the blockchain ledger. This was flagged by the exchange on Friday, and as of the time of writing, there has been a new update posted: “Monero (XMR) deposits have been re-enabled and now require 720 confirmations before crediting. Given the current uncertainty around the security of the Monero network due to significant consolidation of hash rate under a single entity, Kraken may halt deposits at any time and delay crediting at its discretion.” The mining pool responsible for the disruption is Qubic, a blockchain that hosts an AI model called AIGarth. According to a post on their blog, this was an experiment they conducted earlier last week, and they claimed this was possible via unique consensus models available on their chain. This was aimed at proving that Monero’s network is not secure enough and that Qubic’s validators should be responsible for securing it going forward. They further stated that the “Monero network’s core functionality remains intact. Its privacy, speed, and usability have not been compromised.” The team behind the blockchain network has not yet confirmed or denied any aftereffects of the attack. At press time, the native token, XMR, trades at around $276, even up 4% on the day, unaffected by the event. Source: CoinMarketCap Previous Examples Of Such Attacks While it’s still early to determine if this controversial attack will have any effects on the blockchain, there have been past scenarios where the consequences have been quite detrimental. Ethereum Classic (ETC), a split from the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain we know today, is the “classic” version of the chain that was initially launched in 2015. Between 2019 and 2020, the network suffered two 51% attacks involving double-spending, resulting in over $6 million in losses. Another spin-off, Bitcoin Gold (BTG), the “user-friendly” alternative to Bitcoin (BTC), underwent a double-spend attack in 2018, resulting in a loss of around $18 million. The majority of this type of attack has subsided in recent years, primarily due to technological advancements, blockchain upgrades, and improvements in consensus models. As noted above, we have yet to see the impact of this most recent network security breach.

Cardano, XRP, Ethereum, Avalanche, and MAGACOIN FINANCE are each drawing attention for unique reasons — from technical setups to community-driven traction. Here’s why they are at the center of discussions for 2025. Cardano Nears the Bull Market Door Cardano (ADA) has been building momentum, gaining nearly 20% last week and more than 30% across two consecutive weeks. The asset briefly flipped Tron, reclaiming the ninth-largest spot in market cap rankings. Analysts point to the $1.25 price level as a critical threshold — what they call the “bull market door.” If ADA sustains above this region, analysts expect a major rally phase that could redefine its valuation in 2025. Historical patterns show ADA facing resistance near this zone in 2022 and 2023, but breaking past it would signal a structural shift. Analyst Dan Gambardello has emphasized that a breakout above this point opens the path to higher levels, with projections running into double digits. Adding to the case, futures market activity has surged, with volumes hitting $7 billion in a single week — the highest in five months. That level of activity highlights growing conviction in ADA as one of the top altcoins to watch closely heading into 2025. XRP Price Stalls After SEC Case Ends Ripple’s XRP settled its long-running legal battle with the U.S. SEC last week, a case that stretched nearly five years. The resolution briefly lifted XRP to $3.38, but it has since retraced to $2.95, leaving many questioning the subdued response. The lack of follow-through suggests that most of the optimism was priced in earlier. Analysts note that XRP surged fivefold in the weeks following Trump’s re-election, anticipating a more crypto-friendly policy stance. With that run-up already in place, the actual case dismissal triggered a “buy the rumor, sell the news” effect. Still, longer-term expectations remain high. Analysts like Dark Defender dismiss the idea that XRP will remain near current levels for long, instead projecting multi-fold gains if adoption accelerates. Many argue that for XRP to move higher, Ripple must convert its regulatory win into practical adoption by financial institutions. With tokenization services and partnerships on the agenda, XRP remains on analysts’ radar as a top altcoin to watch for 2025. Ethereum and Avalanche Strengthen Institutional Appeal Ethereum continues to dominate institutional discussions, with ETH closing above $4,400 — its strongest weekly finish since 2021. A wave of ETF-driven demand has pushed inflows past $2.9 billion in a single week, according to CoinShares. BlackRock’s ETHA product alone now holds nearly $15 billion in ETH. This surge in institutional interest comes alongside record network usage, with July recording over 46 million transactions across stablecoins, DeFi, and Layer 2 solutions. These fundamentals set Ethereum apart as not just the largest altcoin by market cap but also one of the most widely integrated in real-world finance. Analysts suggest that if ETF inflows continue at this pace, Ethereum could be positioned for new all-time highs in the cycle ahead. Avalanche (AVAX), meanwhile, is building its case as a programmable payments platform. Recent developments include a $250 million real-world asset tokenization deal and Visa’s integration for stablecoin settlements across multiple currencies. Daily transactions on the Avalanche network have doubled in the past two weeks, highlighting rising utility even as prices faced pullbacks. Institutional endorsements add weight to Avalanche’s long-term role. Notably, Norway’s $1.7 trillion sovereign wealth fund has indirect exposure through crypto-linked firms tied to AVAX. Although short-term volatility remains, both Ethereum and Avalanche are cited by analysts as top-tier altcoins to monitor for 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE Attracts Thousands of Holders MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly become one of the best altcoins to buy now, drawing thousands of holders with demand rising by the hour. Millions has already flowed in, making it one of the most active launches in the space this year. Analysts highlight MAGACOIN as a standout due to its pace of adoption and fast-rising price traction. With over 12,000 wallets already in, MAGACOIN is being positioned alongside bigger names for 2025 discussions. Its growing visibility across X and Telegram has also fueled urgency among early buyers who see this as the entry point before wider exchange listings. Main Takeaway Cardano, XRP, Ethereum, Avalanche, and MAGACOIN FINANCE are all in focus as altcoins to watch for 2025. Each brings a different driver — from institutional inflows to surging community adoption. For those looking at entry points, MAGACOIN FINANCE is seeing rapid demand right now, with its price gaining traction every hour. Access MAGACOIN FINANCE via the official website.

While Bitcoin is widely regarded as the leading cryptocurrency with long-term stability, Shultz’s calculations indicate that XRP could deliver substantially higher gains under certain scenarios. Bitcoin’s Potential At the time of analysis, Bitcoin was trading near $120,643. A $5,000 investment at this price would purchase approximately 0.041 BTC. If Bitcoin were to reach $1 million per coin within five years, that position would be valued at around $41,400, representing a gain of roughly 730%, or just over eight times the original investment. Although this return is significant, it may not offer the same upside potential as some alternative cryptocurrencies. Influential figures like Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson and former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey have predicted that Bitcoin could surpass $1 million by 2030, supporting its long-term appeal. $5,000 in Bitcoin or XRP?

A $5,000 investment would acquire approximately 1,558 tokens. If XRP were to reach $100 within five years, the investment would be worth about $155,800, more than 30 times the initial price and roughly five times the projected profit from Bitcoin. Shultz emphasized that focusing solely on absolute price targets can be misleading. While Bitcoin’s million-dollar goal captures public attention, XRP’s lower entry price allows for a much higher percentage gain if it achieves substantial growth. For investors seeking maximum returns in a five-year timeframe, XRP presents a compelling case, assuming its price rises significantly. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Is $100 for XRP Realistic? Achieving $100 would require XRP to increase by over 3,000% from its current level. Opinions within the crypto community differ widely. Matthew Brienen , COO at CryptoCharged, considers reaching $100 highly likely by 2030. Conversely, a report by Bitwise projects a more conservative scenario, with XRP potentially reaching only around $29. Some community analysts hold even more aggressive views. Javon Marks suggests XRP could reach $100 within the current year, while Xena claims potential to hit $1,000 per coin, potentially creating more individual millionaires than Bitcoin would at $1 million. Both Bitcoin and XRP offer opportunities for substantial gains, but the scale of potential returns differs. Bitcoin remains the industry leader and carries strong backing from influential figures, yet its current high price limits upside relative to lower-priced assets. XRP, while requiring a dramatic increase to reach $100, could generate far higher returns on a $5,000 investment within the next five years if optimistic forecasts materialize. Investors should consider both the stability of Bitcoin and the high-growth potential of XRP when making strategic decisions.

The company’s aggressive ETH accumulation strategy, led by Tom Lee, mirrors MSTR’s BTC playbook and could unlock staking and DeFi opportunities. Risks include ETH price volatility, share dilution from capital raises, and regulatory uncertainty, making BMNR a high-risk, high-reward investment. I am bullish on BMNR as a leveraged ETH play, believing mass adoption and regulatory clarity could drive substantial shareholder returns over time. Bitmine Immersion Technologies ( BMNR ) has gained a lot of steam as Tom Lee from Fundstrat has transformed what was once a company focused on Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining to a leading Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) treasury company globally. BMNR’s strategy is designed to accumulate ETH through capital raises and strategic purchases and mirror what Michael Saylor has done through Strategy Inc. ( MSTR ). BMNR’s goal is to acquire up to 5% of all the ETH in circulation. While I am not favoring BMNR over holding ETH directly as I currently do, I believe BMNR has the potential for explosive growth as there is leveraged upside potential, which can receive a large premium on the net asset value (NAV) of its ETH holdings. As BMNR acquires more ETH, its NAV will increase, and investors could experience amplified returns if ETH is in an upward trend. If BMNR does reach its goal of owning 5% of the total ETH in circulation, it could enhance network effects and scarcity, which would allow BMNR to outperform the returns of just owning ETH directly, which is reflected in how BTC treasury firms have historically outpaced BTC’s price appreciation. BMNR still maintains some of its prior BTC operations, but the value is becoming more correlated toward ETH, which I am more bullish on because I see BTC as a store of value with minimal to no utility. The move into ETH will provide BMNR with broader crypto ecosystem exposure, which could include large staking rewards and DeFi integrations. As of August 11th, BMNR became the largest ETH treasury globally as it added 316863 ETH over the course of one week, going from 833,137 to 1.15 million, and it is now the 3rd largest crypto treasury globally. As of the current price, BMNR has a NAV of $5.2 billion just on its ETH holdings with a market cap of $6.33 billion. I am bullish on ETH and believe that over the next several years its price per token will have the ability to experience large amounts of appreciation, which is bullish for BMNR as it should trade at a premium to its ETH holdings. BMNR is likely to continue its capital raises, which will expand its NAV and the amount of ETH it holds, which should also lead to tremendous expansion from the levels it’s at today. Seeking Alpha Risks to investing in BMNR Just because I am bullish on ETH and BMNR does not mean that BMNR will produce positive returns in the future. Investing in BMNR is an indirect investment in ETH, as it’s holding 1.15 million ETH with plans to own 5% of the ETH in circulation. BMNR has become the world’s largest holder of ETH, which is still a highly speculative asset that is extremely volatile. If ETH’s price declines, then BMNR could see drastic declines in its share price as it’s the main asset on BMNR’s books. BMRN is frequently issuing new shares using market offerings and public sales, which can lead to significant dilution. As BMNR adds shares to fund its ETH acquisitions, the amount of ETH each share represents could decline and cause the share price to decline in the future. There are also unknown regulatory risks for BMNR as U.S. and global rules could change in the future. There could be risks for ETH as central bank digital currencies may compete with ETH. If mass adoption with ETF doesn’t occur from stablecoins being built on top of it and tokenization of assets becomes a flop, then the utility appeal of ETH will decline, which could cause a massive drop in ETH prices and correlate to large losses for BMNR. Investors should do their own due diligence on ETH and BMNR before allocating any capital toward BMNR, as this is not a traditional equity and it comes with much larger risks. Why I have become very bullish on BMNR BMNR has gone from specializing in immersion-cooled BTC mining to aggressively amassing an ETH treasury under the leadership of Tom Lee, who is a veteran Wall Street analyst and crypto advocate. This strategic pivot has led to substantial capital raises, including a recent expansion of stock offerings to $24.5 billion and their positioning themselves to acquire 5% of the ETH in circulation. BMNR launched its ETH treasury on June 30th, and it's already the largest ETH treasury in the world as it owns 1.15 million ETH with a value of $5.2 billion. BMNR is still operating its ongoing mining operations and hosting services, which provide diversified revenue streams that will complement the ETH focus that BMNR is embarking on. By leveraging equity issuances to fund ETH purchases, BMNR emulates MSTR’s playbook and adapts it to ETH’s smart contract ecosystem, which could unlock staking yields and DeFi integrations to enhance shareholder value. When MSTR started, it was trading at $13.49 while BTC traded for $11,000, and by the end of June 2025, BTC increased by 11x to $118,000 and MSTR increased by 30x to $407.76. BMNR had increased by 9.5x at the end of June, while ETH experienced a 1.5x increase, and the current treasury strategy could lead to larger gains in BMNR’s share price compared to ETH going forward. Bitmine Immersion Technologies ETH is an open-source blockchain platform that is decentralized, which allows end users to create and execute smart contracts and decentralized applications ((dApps)). ETH operates as a peer-to-peer network where participants maintain a shared ledger of transactions without relying on intermediaries like banks or governments, which is secured by a global network of computers operating Ethereum software. The smart contract aspect is a self-executing program stored on the blockchain that automatically runs when predefined conditions are met, which can include transferring funds or executing trades. They power dApps, which can range from decentralized finance platforms to games and social networks. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are designed to maintain a consistent value and bridge traditional finance and crypto by enabling fast, low-cost transactions while preserving stability. ETH has become a primary platform for building and issuing stablecoins due to its widespread adoption. ETH’s smart contract system allows stablecoins to be programmed with automated mechanisms for maintaining their peg, such as collateralization, algorithmic adjustments, or reserves managed via decentralized autonomous organizations. USDC , which is issued by Circle ( CRCL ), is built on ETH because of its secure and scalable environment that supports high liquidity and interoperability. The ERC-20 token standard simplifies creation and integration, which makes it easy for stablecoins to interact with DeFi protocols, exchanges, and wallets on the network. As the leading smart contract blockchain, I believe that ETH will expand its current utilization rate as it is already powering thousands of dApps, DeFi protocols, and stablecoins. There is also the ability to tokenize real-world assets like bonds and real estate, which would position ETH for mainstream integration. We’re seeing mainstream interest surge as BlackRock just purchased an additional $338 million of ETH and SharpLink Gaming ( SBET ) has acquired over $3 billion of ETH since May. There is currently $410 billion worth of value secured on ETH, and the largest institutions are buying large amounts of ETH as more assets become tied to it. I am very bullish on BMNR because it provides leveraged exposure to ETH, and it should trade at a larger premium to NAV in the future. As an ETH Treasury, BMNR can outperform direct ETH holdings as it would generate network effects from its underlying ETH through staking and creating scarcity in the marketplace. While this may sound silly, I believe that BMNR trading as a traditional equity on the NYSE is bullish because it can be bought through standard brokerage accounts, which avoids complexities of crypto exchanges, such as wallet management, private key security, or custody risks. BMNR may also appeal to institutions that don’t want direct exposure to crypto and would rather allocate capital toward an ETH Treasury for exposure to the asset class. The GENIUS Act , which was recently signed into legislation, is the first comprehensive federal regulatory framework for stablecoins, and it aims at fostering innovation in the crypto space. I believe this is bullish for ETH due to its dominant role in the stablecoin ecosystem, and it will pave the way for increased liquidity as ETH will be looked at as a compliant hub for tokenizing real-world assets and payments. We are still in ETH’s infancy, and depending on how widespread the use case gets, ETH could see its price expand considerably, which would be very bullish for BMNR as it should get a levered premium on its trove of ETH. Bitmine Immersion Technologies Conclusion My bull case for BMNR is tied to increased utilization across the ETH ecosystem. The GENIUS Act has paved the way for mass adoption, and we are in the infancy of what ETH can be used for in the future. The past decade has shown us that everything is going digital, and ETH could be the bridge to tokenizing asset markets and stablecoin issuance on ETH, which would encourage institutional adoption. Tom Lee has labeled ETH as the biggest macro trade over the next 10–15 years and believes that it could hit $25,000 per ETH by 2028. An investment in BMNR is very risky, but if mass adoption across decentralized finance platforms occurs, we could see ETH catch a large bid considering BTC is trading for around $118,000 and has limited utility compared to ETH. If this occurs, then there could be a lot of value to be unlocked in shares of BMNR as it is positioned to be the largest holder of ETH and should trade at a premium to its NAV, which could allow investors to experience large gains from buying ETH independently. I am purchasing BMNR as an indirect play on ETH, as I believe this strategy will generate substantial returns for shareholders over the next several years.",ETH-USD|BMNR,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-08-19 00:00:30

The filing , accepted by the SEC on August 15, 2025 under the registrant name Gemini Space Station, Inc., details the registration and supporting exhibits for the deal. The Role Of Ripple In Gemini’s IPO The core of the arrangement is straightforward: Ripple has committed a $75 million secured revolver to a Gemini financing vehicle, with room—subject to performance triggers—to rise to $150 million. The agreement allows borrowings above the base commitment to be funded not only in dollars but, at Gemini’s request and Ripple’s consent, “in the RLUSD equivalent of US Dollars,” explicitly defining RLUSD as Ripple’s US-dollar stablecoin. Minimum draw size is “at a minimum equivalent to $5,000,000,” and the document states for clarity, “For the avoidance of doubt, the Commitment shall not exceed $150,000,000.” Where the filing becomes market-relevant is less about the legal plumbing and more about IPO positioning. Gemini confirms it plans to list on Nasdaq under the ticker GEMI, with Goldman Sachs and Citigroup as lead bookrunners. Proceeds are earmarked for general corporate purposes and repayment of third-party debt—signals that the company is seeking balance-sheet flexibility rather than financing growth solely through equity. The S-1 paints a mixed operating picture heading into the roadshow. For the six months ended June 30, 2025, Gemini posted $68.6 million in revenue and a $282.5 million net loss—worse than the year-earlier period. Still, management is taking the company public into a friendlier tape for crypto listings, following debuts by Bullish and Circle . Broad reach remains a selling point: as of June 30, Gemini cites 14.6 million verified users and $12 billion in assets under custody. Strategically, the Ripple line reads as a liquidity shock-absorber for an issuer operating in a volatile asset class. It gives Gemini the option to tap a traditional dollar facility and, when capacity expands, to draw in RLUSD—folding a stablecoin rail directly into a regulated credit instrument. That is a distinctive pre-IPO narrative hook for investors comparing exchange models and treasury toolkits, especially as the filing positions GEMI alongside Coinbase and the recently listed Bullish as the cohort of US-traded exchanges grows. What’s next? Gemini has not disclosed deal size or pricing. Watch for the first amendment to the S-1 to set an initial range, updated financials, and any refinements to use-of-proceeds and risk disclosures. The SEC docket already shows the full exhibit list—including the Ripple credit agreement—under Accession No. 0001104659-25-079323, confirming the company’s path toward a Nasdaq debut as GEMI once market and regulatory conditions align.

XRP May Visit These Levels Of A Parallel Channel Next In an X post on Sunday, analyst Ali Martinez pointed out how XRP was at risk of observing a further drop if it couldn’t reclaim the $3.3 level. Below was the chart shared by the analyst. In the graph, Martinez highlighted a Parallel Channel that XRP has followed since late last year. A Parallel Channel is a TA pattern that forms whenever the price of an asset consolidates between two parallel trendlines. The upper line of the channel is likely to be a point of resistance, while the lower one that of support. A breakout of either of these bounds can trigger a continuation of the trend in that direction. Related Reading: Institutions Buying The Bitcoin Dip? Coinbase Premium Shoots Up From the chart, it’s visible that the asset slipped below the lower line of the Parallel Channel back in April, but this breakdown lasted only briefly, with the coin swiftly recovering back into the channel. Similarly, the cryptocurrency saw a breakout above the pattern last month, but once again the signal couldn’t sustain as its price returned below the upper line. Since then, XRP has made a couple of retests of this line situated at $3.3, but each attempt has been rejected. On Sunday, the analyst warned that the coin could face a further drawdown if it failed to recover to this level. Today, Martinez quoted the chart, noting that the asset has just lost another support level: $3. This line is located a quarter of the way down the Parallel Channel. Now, what could be next for XRP? According to the analyst, the coin may be heading to $2.6, corresponding to the midway line of the channel, or even $2, which represents its lower bound. These are just the support levels available to the cryptocurrency from a TA perspective. Another major support level could perhaps be hinted at by on-chain data, as Martinez shared in another X post. In the chart, the data for the recent Cost Basis Distribution of XRP is shown. According to this indicator, investors last accumulated around 1.7 million tokens of the cryptocurrency at the $2.81 level. Since the spot price is trading above this mark right now, these holders would be sitting on some gain. Generally, if the market mood is bullish, investors in profit react to retests of their cost basis by buying more. This is because they may look at the drawdown as just a ‘dip.’ Related Reading: Dogecoin Bullish Signal: Whales Buy 2 Billion DOGE The more concentrated a level is with supply, the stronger this reaction is. As such, the $2.81 level with its dense supply could play the role of a major support level for XRP in the event of a retrace to it. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is trading around $2.99, down over 6% in the last week.

Large holders appear focused on long-term positioning, even as retail traders react to price swings and short-term volatility. At the same time, large investors are quietly accumulating MAGACOIN FINANCE, an emerging altcoin analysts say every smart investor must have in their portfolio. This wave of accumulation highlights long-term conviction in leading assets, while retail traders remain cautious during periods of volatility. Ethereum Accumulation Despite Volatility Ethereum (ETH) continues to demonstrate why it is considered the backbone of the crypto market. While short-term volatility and liquidations can unsettle traders, the long-term trend remains positive. Institutions have steadily increased their exposure to Ethereum, with inflows into ETH-based products often surpassing Bitcoin’s. Large investors have also continued accumulating ETH, reinforcing confidence in its future growth. With Ethereum powering the majority of decentralized finance and maintaining the largest share of value locked, many analysts still view it as one of the best altcoins to buy now for long-term portfolios Solana Draws Institutional Inflows Solana (SOL) trades between $181–$195 after profit-taking, but whale and institutional buying continue. Solana continues to attract some of the largest institutional inflows in the altcoin market, with investment products tied to the network consistently ranking among the biggest weekly gainers. Solana continues to draw institutional attention, with new ETFs attracting fresh capital and major funds expanding their holdings. This steady inflow highlights growing confidence in Solana’s long-term role in both staking and DeFi. MAGACOIN FINANCE Picked as the Smart Investment MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining attention alongside Ethereum and Solana as whales and retail investors who are selling established tokens pick it as the next crypto market opportunity. Thousands of smart investors have already bought into the token ahead of the upcoming bull run. Analysts highlight MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the few new projects with structured token limits and growing investor accumulation. A limited-time 50% presale bonus with the code PATRIOT50X has fueled urgency, with investors aiming to secure positions before the token’s supply runs out. Analysts predict MAGACOIN FINANCE will outperform in 2025 and is definitely a must-have for every smart investor hoping to make massive returns. With both whales and smaller buyers active in the project, MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to draw attention as investors look for opportunities beyond established tokens. Conclusion Ethereum and Solana remain whale favorites, but MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly positioning itself as the best altcoin of 2025 , thanks to its capped supply, surging presale activity, and early investor bonuses. For those looking beyond the market’s short-term fear, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the standout choice for long-term growth.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index provides a unique snapshot of investor sentiment, acting as a vital barometer. Recently, this key indicator registered 56, firmly placing it in the ‘Greed’ zone despite a slight dip. What does this mean for you and your crypto journey? What Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Reveal? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , developed by software development platform Alternative, offers a clear numerical representation of market sentiment. It operates on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 signifies “Extreme Fear” and 100 denotes “Extreme Greed.” This index helps investors gauge whether the market is overly optimistic or excessively pessimistic, often serving as a contrarian indicator. When the index leans towards “Extreme Fear,” it might suggest a buying opportunity for brave investors. Conversely, an “Extreme Greed” reading could signal a potential market correction or an opportune time to consider profit-taking. It’s about understanding the crowd’s collective emotion. Decoding Current Crypto Fear & Greed Index Sentiment: Why 56 is Significant As of August 19, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index registered a value of 56. This marks a four-point decrease from the previous day, yet it comfortably remains within the “Greed” territory. A reading of 56 suggests that while some exuberance might have slightly receded, the overall market mood is still positive and confident. This sustained ‘Greed’ level indicates that investors are generally feeling optimistic about cryptocurrency prices. However, it’s a subtle reminder that sentiment can shift quickly. Monitoring these movements provides valuable insights into potential market directions and helps inform your strategy. How Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculate Sentiment? The index is not just a random number; it’s a sophisticated aggregation of several crucial market factors. Each factor contributes a specific weight to the final score, providing a comprehensive view of sentiment. Understanding these components is key to appreciating the index’s utility. Here are the primary factors influencing the Crypto Fear & Greed Index : Volatility (25%): Measures current Bitcoin volatility and maximum drawdowns compared to average values. Higher volatility often correlates with fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Analyzes current market volume and momentum compared to long-term averages. Strong buying volume indicates greed. Social Media (15%): Scans various social media platforms for crypto-related hashtags and analyzes the sentiment of posts. Increased positive mentions can indicate greed. Surveys (15%): Polls a large group of investors to gauge their sentiment directly. (Note: This component is currently paused). Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Assesses Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. A rising dominance can sometimes signal fear in altcoins, as investors flock to perceived safety. Google Trends (10%): Examines search query trends for crypto-related terms. Sudden increases in “Bitcoin price manipulation” searches, for example, could signal fear. Navigating Market Volatility with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index For both seasoned traders and new entrants, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a powerful tool for strategic decision-making. It’s not a buy or sell signal on its own, but rather a guide to understanding the prevailing emotional climate of the market. Using it wisely can help you avoid emotional pitfalls. Actionable Insights: Counter-Trade Opportunities: When the index hits “Extreme Fear,” consider it a potential opportunity to buy when others are panicking. Prudent Profit-Taking: If the index enters “Extreme Greed,” it might be a good time to consider taking some profits or re-evaluating your positions. Risk Management: Use the index to inform your overall risk appetite. High greed could mean higher risk of correction. However, remember that the index is just one tool. Always combine its insights with fundamental analysis, technical indicators, and your personal financial goals. The crypto market remains dynamic and unpredictable. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index provides a compelling window into the collective psyche of the crypto market. Its current reading of 56 in the ‘Greed’ zone highlights an ongoing optimistic sentiment, even with a slight reduction from previous days. By understanding its components and implications, investors can gain a crucial edge in navigating the volatile yet exciting world of digital assets. Stay informed, stay strategic, and let market sentiment guide, not dictate, your decisions. Frequently Asked Questions About the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Here are some common questions about this important market indicator: What does a high Crypto Fear & Greed Index score mean? A high score, typically above 50 and especially above 75, indicates “Greed” or “Extreme Greed.” This suggests that investors are feeling very optimistic and confident about the market, which can sometimes precede a price correction. Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index a reliable buy or sell signal? No, it’s not a direct buy or sell signal. Instead, it’s a sentiment indicator that helps you understand the prevailing emotional state of the market. Many traders use it as a contrarian tool: buying during extreme fear and considering selling during extreme greed. Which factors influence the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The index considers six main factors: volatility, market momentum/volume, social media sentiment, surveys (currently paused), Bitcoin dominance, and Google Trends data. Each factor contributes a specific weight to the overall score. How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? The index is updated daily by Alternative, providing a fresh snapshot of market sentiment for investors to consider. Can I use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index for altcoins? While the index is primarily focused on Bitcoin, as Bitcoin’s dominance is a factor, its general sentiment often reflects the broader cryptocurrency market. However, specific altcoin projects may have their own unique sentiment drivers. Found this analysis of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index insightful?

50309625,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=787207,1755563335,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50309625.jpeg,Starling bank snaps up accounting startup to power SME tax tools,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/starling-bank-snaps-up-accounting-startup/,"Starling Bank has acquired British accounting software startup Ember, aiming to strengthen its suite of services for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The challenger bank plans to offer business clients integrated tax and bookkeeping tools alongside its core banking products. The deal’s financial terms were not disclosed, though sources familiar with the transaction said it was valued at under £10 million (around $13.5 million). Declan Ferguson, Starling’s chief financial officer, described the acquisition as a natural extension of the bank’s existing offerings. He noted that combining invoicing, accounting, and tax software with traditional banking services like loans and credit facilities made strategic sense. Starling braces for new era of tax rules Mergers are crucial for small businesses and self-employed workers in Britain. From next year, HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) will implement new rules forcing about 780,000 sole traders and landlords to update the taxman on their income and expenses every three months rather than annually. The move is part of the government’s Making Tax Digital project. For a small business owner, the pressure to comply will also increase with these new, quarterly filings. By embedding Ember’s tools, Starling aims to make tax compliance painless for its close to 500,000 small business customers. The financial firm’s small-business portfolio has expanded rapidly in recent years. The bank was among the most active lenders under the government-backed schemes to support business through the pandemic, allowing it to develop close ties with small companies and entrepreneurs up and down the country. Ember, founded in 2019, marketed itself as a modern, digital-first accounting platform. It enables entrepreneurs to automate bookkeeping, keep up-to-date with expenses, and handle taxes on a mobile-friendly interface. Last year, the company also raised £5 million via funding led by Valar Ventures — the venture capital firm funded by Peter Thiel and Shapers. Previously, Ember has worked with heavyweights including HSBC, Revolut, Barclays, and Lloyds in banking to provide integrated accounting functionality. These partnerships will, however, phase out by 2026, as Ember becomes part of Starling’s ecosystem. The startup will cease its accounting advisory services as part of the acquisition. There will be the opportunity for around 30 Ember employees to join the financial firm, providing continuity in knowledge. Co-founders Daniel Hogan and Aaron Shaw will join the bank and drive integration. The deal will close Ember’s time as an independent entity, but its technology will now be able to cater to a much broader range of SMEs via Starling’s banking infrastructure. Starling soldiers on despite regulatory setbacks The deal comes at a difficult time for Starling. The bank was fined £29m by regulators in October last year for what was described as “shockingly lax” controls over high-risk customers between September 2011 and November 2013. Certainly, Starling is operating under an FCA voluntary restriction. This action prevents the bank from bringing on certain types of customers until it fixes deficiencies in its compliance systems. Even so, Starling has pursued further products and tech investment. Outside the UK, Starling was said to be eyeing international expansion. Bloomberg reported in June that the bank was considering the purchase of a nationally chartered bank in the United States. It was also reported that Starling had entered talks to hire senior US bankers during the summer to advise on the process, although the bank declined to comment. The lender’s chief financial officer, Declan Ferguson, noted that there was a real opportunity to establish a regulated business model in the US. Starling puts itself out as more than just a digital bank by taking hold of Ember. It’s evolving into a hub for small businesses requiring banking, accounting, and tax services on one platform. The move indicates Starling’s ambition to take on high street banks and fintech competitors such as Tide and Revolut, which are extending their SME offerings. The merger, for small businesses that already were navigating tighter rules, more reporting requirements, and surging costs, could mean simplicity at last.

Recently, the South Korean internet giant Naver made headlines with a significant financial move concerning its WEMIX tokens , highlighting the volatile nature of the crypto market. This event serves as a crucial reminder that even established corporations face unique risks when engaging with cryptocurrencies. What Exactly Happened with Naver’s WEMIX Tokens ? Naver, a household name in South Korea’s tech landscape, has officially written off its holdings of WEMIX tokens . This wasn’t a small adjustment; the company recorded a full impairment of 866,700 WEMIX, which translates to approximately $2.4 million. This substantial write-off occurred in the first half of this year, signaling a notable financial decision. An impairment, in accounting terms, means that the book value of an asset is reduced because its market value has declined below its carrying value. Essentially, Naver acknowledges that its investment in these WEMIX tokens is no longer worth what it initially paid. Why Did Naver Hold WEMIX Tokens in the First Place? Many might wonder why an internet giant like Naver would possess a significant amount of WEMIX tokens . The answer lies in a strategic partnership established back in 2020. Naver acquired these tokens as part of an agreement that designated it a WEMIX Block Partner. This collaboration aimed to explore the potential of blockchain technology and its integration into Naver’s vast ecosystem. Such partnerships are common in the crypto space, where traditional companies seek to leverage decentralized technologies for new services or enhanced user experiences. Therefore, Naver’s initial acquisition of WEMIX tokens was a strategic investment, not merely a speculative one. What Does This Mean for the Future of WEMIX Tokens and the Crypto Market? Naver’s decision to impair its WEMIX tokens after nearly five years raises important questions for the broader digital asset landscape. While specific reasons for the impairment haven’t been fully detailed beyond the financial accounting, it underscores the inherent risks associated with holding volatile cryptocurrencies. For investors and developers in the WEMIX ecosystem, this news serves as a reminder of market fluctuations and corporate strategy shifts. It highlights that even long-term holdings by major entities are subject to re-evaluation based on performance and market conditions. Consequently, the impairment could influence investor sentiment around similar blockchain-based gaming and platform tokens. Lessons Learned from Naver’s WEMIX Tokens Experience This event offers several key takeaways for anyone involved in the crypto space, whether you’re an individual investor or a large corporation considering digital asset integration: Due Diligence is Crucial: Before engaging with any digital asset, thorough research into its fundamentals, team, and market viability is essential. Understanding the project’s long-term vision and potential pitfalls can prevent costly write-offs like those involving WEMIX tokens . Risk Management: Companies and individuals holding cryptocurrencies must have clear strategies for managing potential losses, including impairment policies and diversification. Setting clear entry and exit points is vital. Long-Term Vision vs. Volatility: Even strategic partnerships involving WEMIX tokens or other digital assets can face challenges due to market volatility or evolving business priorities. What seems promising today might require re-evaluation tomorrow. Transparency: Financial reporting like Naver’s impairment provides valuable transparency into corporate crypto holdings, which can influence market sentiment and inform future investment decisions. Naver’s $2.4 million impairment on its WEMIX tokens serves as a powerful illustration of the dynamic and sometimes unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. It highlights that even major corporations are not immune to the financial adjustments required when digital asset values shift. As the crypto world continues to evolve, such events reinforce the importance of cautious investment and robust risk assessment. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What are WEMIX tokens? WEMIX tokens are the native cryptocurrency of the WEMIX platform, a blockchain-based gaming and entertainment ecosystem developed by Wemade. They are used for transactions, governance, and rewards within the ecosystem. 2. Why did Naver acquire WEMIX tokens? Naver acquired WEMIX tokens in 2020 as part of a strategic partnership agreement. This made Naver a WEMIX Block Partner, aiming to explore and integrate blockchain technology into its services. 3. What does “impairment” mean in this context? In accounting, an impairment means that the value of an asset on a company’s balance sheet has decreased below its original cost. Naver’s impairment of WEMIX tokens signifies that the company has reduced the recorded value of its holdings to reflect a decline in their market price. 4. Does this impairment affect the WEMIX platform directly? While Naver’s impairment is a financial decision by one of its partners, it does not directly impact the operational functionality of the WEMIX platform. However, such news from a prominent partner can influence market sentiment and investor confidence in WEMIX tokens. 5. What can we learn from Naver’s decision regarding WEMIX tokens? This event underscores the volatility and risks inherent in cryptocurrency investments, even for large corporations. It highlights the importance of thorough due diligence, robust risk management strategies, and transparency in reporting digital asset holdings.

What Exactly Happened with This Large ETH Withdrawal? In the early hours, a fresh, previously inactive digital wallet initiated and completed a significant transaction. This wallet pulled 15,752 Ethereum tokens directly from FalconX, a prime broker for institutional digital asset trading. The sheer volume of ETH involved, equating to tens of millions of dollars, immediately caught the attention of on-chain analytics platforms, including Onchain Lens, which quickly disseminated the information. Transaction Details: 15,752 ETH moved. Value: Approximately $68.24 million at the time of withdrawal. Origin: FalconX, a well-known institutional trading platform. Destination: A newly created, unidentified wallet. This kind of large ETH withdrawal is not an everyday occurrence. It raises questions about the identity of the recipient and the underlying reasons for such a substantial transfer. Why Does a Massive ETH Withdrawal from FalconX Matter? Understanding the implications of this large ETH withdrawal is crucial for anyone following the crypto market. When institutional platforms like FalconX see such considerable outflows, it can suggest several possibilities, each with different potential impacts: Institutional Reallocation: A large entity, such as a hedge fund or an investment firm, might be moving assets to a different custody solution, preparing for an over-the-counter (OTC) trade, or shifting capital between strategies. This often happens quietly and is part of routine asset management. Security Concerns: While less common for established platforms, sometimes large withdrawals can occur if an entity is moving funds due to perceived security risks or a desire for greater self-custody. However, FalconX is generally considered a secure platform. Market Speculation: The movement could precede a significant market event, such as a large sell-off or a strategic accumulation. Traders often interpret such movements as signals, though correlation does not always imply causation. The lack of immediate public information about the wallet’s owner adds to the intrigue, prompting analysts to delve deeper into the on-chain data for clues. What Are the Potential Market Implications of This ETH Movement? A large ETH withdrawal of this magnitude naturally leads to speculation about its potential impact on Ethereum’s price and broader market sentiment. While one single transaction, even a large one, rarely dictates market trends, it can contribute to a narrative or confirm existing suspicions. For instance, if the funds are being moved to a self-custody wallet with no immediate intent to sell, the impact might be minimal. Conversely, if the wallet is linked to an exchange or a known over-the-counter desk, it could signal an impending large sell order, which might exert downward pressure on ETH’s price. However, it’s equally possible that the funds are being prepared for staking, DeFi participation, or entry into new institutional products. Key Takeaways for Investors: Stay Informed: Monitor on-chain analytics for further movements from this wallet. Avoid Panic: Do not make rash decisions based on a single transaction. Evaluate the broader market context. Diversify: Large individual transactions highlight the volatility and unique dynamics of the crypto market. The crypto community will undoubtedly be watching this wallet closely for any subsequent movements that might reveal its purpose. This event underscores the transparency of blockchain technology, where every significant transaction is publicly visible, even if the parties involved remain anonymous. In conclusion, the recent large ETH withdrawal of $68.24 million from FalconX by a new wallet is a significant on-chain event that demands attention. While the precise reasons remain speculative, such movements are integral to understanding the flow of institutional capital within the crypto ecosystem. Whether it signifies a strategic repositioning, a security measure, or a precursor to market action, its sheer scale makes it a key data point for analysts and investors alike. Keeping an eye on subsequent movements from this wallet will provide further clarity on its ultimate intent and potential market ramifications. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is FalconX? FalconX is a cryptocurrency prime broker that offers institutional investors and trading firms a comprehensive suite of services, including trading, credit, and clearing, for digital assets. It facilitates large-volume transactions for professional clients. Q2: Why is a “newly generated wallet” significant? A newly generated wallet often means it’s a fresh address created specifically for this transaction or for a new entity. It makes it harder to immediately identify the owner compared to movements from known exchange wallets or long-standing institutional addresses. Q3: Could this large ETH withdrawal impact Ethereum’s price? While a single transaction of this size can cause short-term speculation, its long-term impact on Ethereum’s price depends on the ultimate intent of the funds. If they are moved for selling, it could create downward pressure; if for holding, staking, or new products, the impact might be neutral or even positive in the long run. Q4: How can I track such large crypto movements? You can track large crypto movements using on-chain analytics platforms like Etherscan, Arkham Intelligence, or services like Onchain Lens, which monitor and report significant transactions across various blockchains.

Recently, the Altcoin Season Index, a key metric tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), registered 43. This specific reading at 00:27 UTC on August 19, a five-point drop from the previous day, clearly indicates that the market is currently in a Bitcoin Season . But what exactly does this mean for your crypto portfolio? What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? To truly grasp the current market dynamics, it’s essential to understand the Altcoin Season Index. This valuable metric, provided by CoinMarketCap, helps investors gauge whether altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin or vice versa. It specifically excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens, focusing on the pure performance of independent cryptocurrencies. Here’s how it works: The index compares the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin over the past 90 days. For a market to be in an Altcoin Season, a significant majority—at least 75%—of these top 100 altcoins must have outperformed Bitcoin. Conversely, a Bitcoin Season is declared when 25% or fewer of these altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin. The index scores range from 1 to 100, with lower scores indicating a stronger Bitcoin Season. A score of 43, as we’ve seen, firmly places us in this phase. Understanding this index is vital for strategic investment decisions, especially during a pronounced Bitcoin Season . Why Are We in Bitcoin Season Right Now? The current Altcoin Season Index reading of 43 signals a strong period of Bitcoin Season . This trend often emerges when investors gravitate towards Bitcoin, the largest and most established cryptocurrency, as a perceived safe haven or a primary growth driver. Several factors can contribute to this shift: Market Uncertainty: During periods of broader economic or crypto market uncertainty, investors often de-risk by moving funds from more volatile altcoins into Bitcoin. Its larger market capitalization and longer track record offer a sense of stability. Dominance Resurgence: Bitcoin’s dominance, which is its market cap share relative to the total crypto market, tends to increase during these periods. This means a larger portion of new money flowing into crypto goes directly into Bitcoin. Pre-Halving Cycles: Historically, Bitcoin often sees strong performance leading up to its halving events, drawing capital away from altcoins. Institutional Interest: Increased institutional adoption or major positive news specifically related to Bitcoin can also lead to a Bitcoin Season , as large players primarily focus on BTC. The recent drop in the index score from 48 to 43 within a day underscores the rapid shift towards Bitcoin’s dominance, making it a critical time to observe market movements. Navigating the Bitcoin Season: What Does This Mean for Investors? For many crypto enthusiasts, a clear Bitcoin Season presents both opportunities and challenges. It requires a nuanced approach to portfolio management: Focus on Bitcoin: During this period, Bitcoin often offers more stable gains compared to altcoins. Investors might consider increasing their BTC holdings or rebalancing their portfolios to reflect Bitcoin’s stronger performance. Altcoin Caution: While some altcoins might still perform well, the overall trend suggests that a majority will struggle to keep pace with Bitcoin. This doesn’t mean avoiding altcoins entirely, but rather being more selective and cautious. Risk Management: It’s a good time to review your risk exposure. High-cap altcoins might be more resilient than smaller, more speculative ones. Diversification within altcoins, if you choose to hold them, remains important. Market Reassessment: Use this period to research potential altcoins for the next Altcoin Season. Projects with strong fundamentals and innovative technology might be good long-term holds, even if they are underperforming Bitcoin currently. Ultimately, understanding the market’s current phase, especially during a strong Bitcoin Season , empowers investors to make informed decisions and adapt their strategies accordingly. In conclusion, the Altcoin Season Index at 43 unequivocally points to a prevailing Bitcoin Season . This signifies a period where Bitcoin is largely outperforming the broader altcoin market, driven by various market dynamics and investor sentiment. By staying informed about these cycles and adjusting your strategy, you can navigate the crypto landscape more effectively. The crypto market is dynamic, and understanding these shifts is paramount for success. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index is a metric that tracks whether altcoins (cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin) are outperforming Bitcoin. It compares the performance of the top 100 coins over the past 90 days, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens. Q2: How is a Bitcoin Season determined? A Bitcoin Season occurs when 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. The Altcoin Season Index will typically be low, often below 50, during this period. Q3: What does an Altcoin Season Index of 43 signify? An Altcoin Season Index of 43 strongly indicates that the market is currently in a Bitcoin Season . This means Bitcoin is generally performing better than most altcoins, and investor focus has shifted towards BTC. Q4: How should investors adjust their strategy during Bitcoin Season? During a Bitcoin Season , investors might consider increasing their exposure to Bitcoin, being more selective with altcoin investments, and focusing on risk management. It’s a good time to re-evaluate portfolios and potentially rebalance towards BTC dominance. Q5: Does Bitcoin Season mean altcoins will never perform well? No, a Bitcoin Season doesn’t mean altcoins will never perform well. It signifies a current market trend. Altcoins can still see individual pumps or perform well in specific niches, but the broader market trend favors Bitcoin’s outperformance. Market cycles change, and an Altcoin Season may follow.

Ethereum and Chainlink whales have been diversifying into smaller projects while keeping core positions intact. Avalanche whales are also joining this move, signaling a wider trend across altcoins. Analysts note that MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the standout presale, drawing strong interest during this rotation. Whale Rotation Strengthens Presale Demand Over $1.4 billion has been rotated by whales in the past week. Most of this capital still sits in Ethereum, Avalanche, and Chainlink. However, a growing share is now moving into early-stage projects with higher upside. MAGACOIN FINANCE is at the center of this trend. The strategy looks clear. Whales build stability with ETH and AVAX, then use a portion of those gains to target faster growth plays. By spreading risk, they balance safety with exponential upside. This approach explains why MAGACOIN is gaining momentum so quickly. MAGACOIN FINANCE Presale Momentum Builds Early adopters are rushing in as MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a 50% EXTRA BONUS with the code PATRIOT50X, fueling presale momentum. This has created a wave of new attention from both retail investors and whales. Analysts point to MAGACOIN’s strong foundation. The project is built on Ethereum and integrates DeFi staking features. Its smart contract has been certified and is undergoing further audits. These factors make it appealing to conservative whales who want safety, as well as growth-focused investors chasing upside. The demand for Ethereum-based assets has risen due to ETF-driven adoption. This has tightened exchange supply and increased institutional holdings. Since MAGACOIN aligns directly with Ethereum’s ecosystem, it stands to benefit from this growing demand. Projections suggest gains of 43x to 70x, depending on exchange listings and market momentum. Altcoin Cycle Setup This whale rotation is part of a larger altcoin cycle. When blue-chip assets like ETH, AVAX, and LINK rally, whales often recycle profits into new tokens. It allows them to stay ahead of the next breakout. With MAGACOIN positioned as a smaller cap, it fits this pattern perfectly. Whales see it as a chance to ride the next wave before it hits major exchanges. Final Thoughts The trend is clear. Whales are keeping core positions in ETH and LINK while directing fresh capital into MAGACOIN. Avalanche investors are following the same path. With strong fundamentals, presale demand, and whale backing, MAGACOIN FINANCE looks like one of the best crypto presale opportunities in 2025.

50310510,559132,1755565217,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50310510.jpeg,Crypto Funds See $3.75B Weekly Surge – Ethereum Claims 77% of It,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-funds-see-3-75b-weekly-ethereum-77-of-it/,"Global crypto asset investment products saw a significant rebound in investor interest last week, with inflows totaling $3.75 billion, according to CoinShares’ latest fund flows report . The figure marks the fourth-largest weekly inflow on record, highlighting renewed activity following several weeks of muted sentiment across the sector. James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, noted that inflows were heavily concentrated: “Unusually, almost all inflows were directed into a single provider, iShares, and one specific investment product. Following recent price gains, total assets under management reached an all-time high of $244 billion on August 13.” While inflows were widespread across multiple digital assets, Ethereum stood out as the dominant contributor, far surpassing Bitcoin in both weekly and year-to-date (YTD) commitments. Ethereum Leads with Record Inflows Ethereum investment products attracted $2.87 billion last week, accounting for roughly 77% of all inflows during the period. This performance brought Ethereum’s YTD inflows to $11 billion, setting a record and underscoring its growing role in institutional portfolios . The scale of capital moving into Ethereum also meant that, relative to assets under management, inflows represented 29% of total Ethereum AuM, compared with Bitcoin’s 11.6%. By comparison, Bitcoin products recorded $552 million in inflows during the week. Although still a substantial figure, it lagged considerably behind Ethereum. Other altcoins also attracted investor attention, with Solana seeing $176.5 million and XRP recording $125.9 million in inflows. Conversely, some assets experienced outflows : Litecoin lost $400,000, while Toncoin saw $1 million withdrawn. The report emphasized that the surge in Ethereum inflows occurred against a backdrop of elevated trading volumes and price strength, bringing ETH close to its historical highs. It is suggested that the concentration of inflows into Ethereum could reflect growing confidence in its evolving role as the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi) and broader blockchain applications . Regional Breakdown and Market Context Geographically, the United States accounted for 99% of all inflows, totaling $3.73 billion. Other markets recorded modest figures: Canada registered $33.7 million, Hong Kong added $20.9 million, and Australia saw $12.1 million. On the other hand, Brazil and Sweden bucked the trend, recording outflows of $10.6 million and $49.9 million, respectively. The heavy US concentration highlights the ongoing dominance of North American institutions in driving digital asset fund flows. Butterfill as aforementioned already pointed out that while the strong inflow numbers are encouraging, the unusual concentration into a single provider highlights the uneven distribution of institutional demand across the sector. Looking ahead, it should be worth monitoring whether Ethereum can sustain this momentum and whether Bitcoin inflows begin to catch up. The record growth in total assets under management across crypto investment products suggests that despite recent volatility, institutional interest in digital assets continues to expand.

Long-Term Holders Send Mixed Signals,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/is-bitcoin-bull-run-nearing-its-end-long-term-holders-send-mixed-signals/,"Bitcoin’s momentum has slowed after reaching a new all-time high above $124,000 last week. The cryptocurrency has since moved lower, with its price slipping by nearly 10% from that peak. At the time of writing, BTC is trading around $115,424, reflecting a 2.5% decline in the past 24 hours. The retracement has drawn attention to on-chain activity and investor behavior, particularly among long-term holders (LTHs). A CryptoQuant analyst has been monitoring realized profit and loss metrics to gauge whether the current cycle is approaching its peak or if more upside potential remains. Data released by the analyst sheds light on how seasoned holders are reacting to Bitcoin’s latest rally. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulls Must Survive Brutal September Before Q4 Hope, Analyst Predicts Long-Term Holder Trends Across Market Cycles CryptoQuant contributor PelinayPA shared an assessment of Bitcoin’s long-term holder realized profit and loss (RPL) metric, which tracks when investors who have held coins for extended periods decide to sell. According to the analyst, this indicator has historically been reliable in signaling both cycle tops and bottoms. The analysis highlights key phases across multiple market cycles. During the 2017 bull market, a surge in LTH realized profits coincided with Bitcoin’s peak. By contrast, in the 2018–2019 bear market, profit realization slowed dramatically, while losses surfaced, reflecting the market bottom. A similar pattern was observed in 2021, though the profit realization was more gradual, suggesting that selling pressure was spread across the market rather than concentrated in short bursts. When Bitcoin entered the 2022–2023 downturn, realized losses increased significantly as the asset fell into the $15,000–$20,000 range. That period was characterized by panic selling among longer-term holders. In the current market, however, PelinayPA notes that while profit-taking is visible, it remains moderate compared with past peaks. This indicates that, although selling is occurring, it has not yet reached the levels typically associated with a cycle top. What the Current Data Suggests for Bitcoin The current phase of moderate profit realization suggests caution but does not confirm that Bitcoin has fully topped out. PelinayPA explained that: Historically, sharp increases in LTH profit realization (large green spikes) align with bull market tops. Current selling (mid-2025) is measured and gradual, which implies BTC may still be in the late stages of a bull cycle. If LTH selling accelerates, it could mark the next peak. This measured approach by long-term holders could mean that the market retains some room for additional upward movement, provided selling pressure does not intensify. At the same time, the data highlights that a shift toward heavier profit-taking would be an important warning signal for traders and institutions watching the market closely. Related Reading: Bitcoin 30-Day CDD Down: Market Absorbs LTH Selling Without Breaking Support On-chain analytics firms frequently point to these long-term holder behaviors as leading indicators. While Bitcoin’s price action continues to consolidate below its record high, how these investors act in the coming weeks could set the tone for the next stage of the cycle. For now, the data suggests that the rally has not yet reached conditions historically associated with a definitive top, but market participants are advised to watch profit realization closely.

He emphasized Ripple’s banking charter application and substantial XRP holdings as factors that could position the company among the world’s top financial institutions. SWIFT Faces Potential Strain Gilbertie raised concerns about the long-term stability of SWIFT, the decades-old system that enables banks to transmit cross-border payment messages. During an interview on the Paul Barron Show, he indicated that the network could experience significant disruption shortly. According to Gilbertie, Ripple’s technological infrastructure, coupled with its move toward a banking license , could allow it to assume a dominant role in international finance. He highlighted Ripple’s holdings of approximately 40 billion XRP tokens and speculated that if the company secures a banking charter, it could utilize these assets to become one of the largest capitalized banks globally. The CEO underscored that such a shift could introduce efficiencies currently absent in traditional banking systems, including eliminating the need for pre-funding accounts in both sending and receiving countries for cross-border transfers. Blockchain Efficiency and Market Impact He further emphasized the operational advantages blockchain offers for international banking. He suggested that Ripple’s ledger system could unlock significant liquidity currently tied up in banks’ balance sheets. By moving transactions from SWIFT to a blockchain-based network, banks could potentially streamline payments, reduce costs, and improve transparency. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 He noted that as global financial standards such as ISO 20022 are adopted, Ripple’s network may handle an increasing share of cross-border transaction volume, challenging SWIFT’s longstanding dominance. He indicated that early adopters would likely begin public reporting of transaction volumes conducted via blockchain, which could highlight the growing role of distributed ledger technology in financial markets. He also discussed the evolving regulatory landscape for XRP. He predicted that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might approve spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) before the end of the year. His firm previously launched the first leveraged XRP ETF in the United States in April, reflecting growing institutional interest in the digital asset. Market Performance and Short-Term Challenges Despite these positive projections, XRP has experienced recent market volatility. As of August 18, the token traded just below $3.00, but quickly rebounded to $3.06, marking a 3.91% decline over the past week. Analysts have indicated that XRP’s near-term performance will depend on maintaining key technical support levels. Failure to surpass resistance at $3.30 could expose the token to further declines, while preserving support at $2.81 is critical to sustaining its bullish outlook. While currently trading below its July peak of $3.65, XRP remains up more than 430% year-on-year, reflecting strong performance relative to broader market trends. Gilbertie’s perspective highlights the potential for Ripple and XRP to reshape cross-border payments, though near-term price fluctuations continue to present risks for investors.
