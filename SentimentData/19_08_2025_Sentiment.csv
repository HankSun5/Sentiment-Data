Why Analysts Compare MAGACOIN FINANCE to Early SHIBA INU Growth,https://timestabloid.com/1000x-potential-why-analysts-compare-magacoin-finance/,"In 2021, Shiba Inu (SHIB) stunned the world with historic gains, turning a meme coin into a multi-billion-dollar ecosystem almost overnight. Now in 2025, crypto analysts are eyeing a new contender: MAGACOIN FINANCE —a rising altcoin in presale that some believe could deliver 1000x returns , just like SHIB did in its early days. While Shiba Inu works to evolve from speculation to real utility, MAGACOIN FINANCE is entering the market with momentum, community energy, and a scalable roadmap—sparking comparisons to SHIB’s breakout phase . Let’s break down what’s happening with SHIB, and why MAGACOIN FINANCE may be one of the best altcoins to buy in 2025 for exponential gains. Shiba Inu Faces Technical Hurdles — But Remains Long-Term Focused Shiba Inu finds itself at a crossroads. One of the signals that the technical analysts gave on August 18, 2025, is the emergence of a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern on their charts. Besides the pattern, the data showed that the number of new wallet addresses was decreasing and that the TVL (Total Value Locked) for Shibarium had dropped by 95%. Besides this, the activity of the whales has also decreased considerably, which is indicative of the lack of strength in the market for the near future. Key Issues: Potential 20% downside if SHIB breaks below $0.00001027. Whale and retail engagement dropping amid macro uncertainty. Bearish sentiment despite solid community size. However, SHIB’s development team is actively working to improve fundamentals: A new developer hub launched on Mintlify to attract builders. Shibarium still handles 4M daily transactions, showing ongoing network use. Over 264 million addresses have been created on Shibarium to date. ShibDAO governance, RPC improvements, and DeFi SDKs have been implemented to improve the ecosystem. SHIB’s perspective for quite a while is positive; however, a lot of investors are beginning to ask themselves whether the next 1000x project will be in another place. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Why Analysts See 1000x Upside Potential The current presale of MAGACOIN FINANCE offers ultra-low entry prices , echoing SHIB’s earliest moments—before its breakout to billions in market cap. Analysts say that if the coin maintains this pace of adoption and hits mainstream exchanges, a 1000x return isn’t just hype—it’s possible , particularly if sentiment shifts in its favor during the next bull run. SHIB proved it was possible with its historic run in 2021, and now MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining attention for its strong community, early-stage momentum, and low entry price—offering similar high-reward potential. Most investors wish they had gotten into SHIB before the hype. But many waited for confirmation—by then, 90% of the gains were already priced in. With MAGACOIN FINANCE , investors are still early. The project is: In presale at a steep discount. Gaining momentum with retail and viral interest. Backed by a vision to combine meme culture with real-world financial tools . If you missed SHIB’s rocket ride, this may be your next best shot. Final Thoughts While Shiba Inu evolves into a Layer-2 project with real DeFi utility, the days of 1000x gains from SHIB may be behind us. But MAGACOIN FINANCE is still in its earliest stages —just as SHIB was when only the boldest believed in its potential. With meme energy, strategic utility, and low presale pricing , MAGACOIN FINANCE is fast becoming one of the most talked-about early-stage cryptos of 2025. If history repeats—or even rhymes—this could be the next great crypto success story.

50308367,559080,1755558048,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50308367.jpeg,$500M Liquidations Rock Ethereum and Bitcoin: Is the Crash Fueling Whale Accumulation?,https://bitcoinist.com/500m-liquidations-rock-ethereum-and-bitcoin-crash/,"The crypto market faced a brutal correction on Monday, with nearly $500 million in liquidations rattling traders across Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). According to CoinGlass data, over 115,000 traders were liquidated as Bitcoin slipped to $115,000 and Ethereum plunged toward the $4,200 danger zone. The cascade was fueled by high leverage exposure, creating a domino effect of forced selling across exchanges. Bitcoin’s sharp drop erased more than $3,000 in value within hours, pulling major altcoins into the red. ETH fell nearly 5%, while Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE) each dropped 4–5%. XRP tested the critical $3 support level, underscoring the market-wide fragility. Interestingly, Chainlink (LINK) bucked the trend, posting a daily 5% gain despite the turmoil. Ethereum Faces a Liquidation Cliff Ethereum appears particularly vulnerable if its price breaks below $4,200. Data from Hyperdash shows that more than 56,000 ETH long positions, worth about $236 million, sit at risk of liquidation near $4,170. Additional liquidation clusters are positioned around $3,940 and $2,150–$2,160, levels that could amplify volatility if triggered. Andrew Kang, founder of Mechanism Capital, warned that ETH could fall as low as $3,600 if the liquidation cascade continues. He added that overall ETH liquidations across exchanges could reach $5 billion, potentially driving prices even lower before stabilizing. Bitcoin Whale Accumulation or General Market Breakdown? Despite the sell-off, some analysts argue the crash may be setting up a whale accumulation phase. Crypto analyst CrypNuevo noted that Bitcoin recently printed a new all-time high before a sudden $1 billion liquidation event, a move he believes was engineered to flush out retail traders. He suggested that one whale absorbed much of the forced selling, signaling that institutional players may be scooping up BTC at discounted prices. If whales are indeed accumulating, the dip could serve as a springboard for the next rally once leveraged positions reset and selling pressure eases. However, with geopolitical uncertainty and fragile support levels, traders should remain cautious. The coming days will determine whether Bitcoin stabilizes above $115,000 and Ethereum holds $4,200, or if another wave of liquidations drags the market deeper into correction.

However, it is advised to do your own research and conduct expert opinion before investing in the volatile crypto market. Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Source: Coinmarketcap Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana’s (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150. In May the price continued to rise and ended the month above the $165 price level, a trend that could not extend through June as the month saw a decline falling below the $150 price level to end the month. July saw a sharp rise to the asset’s volatility with SOL crossing the $200 mark. However, the price could not be maintained and SOL ended the month below the $180 level.",Crypto Price Predictions|Solana,EN,0,0,SOL|TRADING|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-18 23:10:00

50306832,https://timestabloid.com/?p=79136,1755559217,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,SEC Delays Decision on Grayscale Spot XRP ETF. Here’s New Timeline,https://timestabloid.com/sec-delays-decision-on-grayscale-spot-xrp-etf-heres-new-timeline/,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has delayed its decision on the application to list and trade shares of the Grayscale XRP Trust as a spot XRP exchange-traded fund. The application was initially submitted by NYSE Arca on January 30, 2025, with an amendment filed on February 10 . Following these submissions, the amended proposal was published in the Federal Register on February 20, which marked the beginning of the SEC’s review process. On March 11, the Commission extended the review period, and by May 20, it issued an Order Instituting Proceedings to allow for further analysis and additional public comments. This order did not signal approval or rejection; it reflects the need for a deeper examination of whether the exchange’s proposal aligns with the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act, including provisions designed to prevent fraud, manipulation, and to protect investors. SEC’s Reason for Delay Under the Securities Exchange Act, the SEC is required to decide within 180 days after publishing a proposed rule change. However, it can extend it by an additional 60 days if more time is deemed necessary. In its most recent notice on August 18, 2025, the Commission announced that it was exercising this option, extending the deadline for action to October 18, 2025. The agency explained that this extension was appropriate to provide more time for thorough consideration of the filing and the issues raised in the record. This decision aligns with the Commission’s approach to similar digital asset ETF applications, where delays are common as part of the standard review process. By pushing the deadline forward, the SEC has given itself until mid-October to issue a final approval or disapproval of the Grayscale proposal. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Outlook for October The delay does not alter the substance of the application but indicates that the SEC will use the full timeframe allowed under law before making its decision. Between now and the new deadline, the Commission will continue reviewing whether the safeguards and structures proposed by NYSE Arca and Grayscale adequately address investor protection standards and market integrity requirements. As of now, the Grayscale spot XRP ETF remains pending and has not received approval. Trading on NYSE Arca cannot proceed unless the Commission issues a favorable order. The October 18, 2025, deadline represents the final statutory date for action, meaning the SEC must either approve or reject the proposal at that time. Until then, the application remains under review, with the outcome depending on the Commission’s assessment of the full record.

50307322,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=787175,1755559265,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50307322.jpeg,Texas is investigating Meta and Character.ai for marketing chatbots as therapists,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/meta-and-character-ai-face-investigation/,"Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has opened an inquiry into Meta and Character.ai on whether the tech firms promote their chatbots as mental health experts and therapists without proper qualifications. In a statement on Monday, Paxton’s office stated it is examining Meta and Character.AI over possible “deceptive trade practices.” The office argued that the chatbots have been marketed as “professional therapeutic tools, despite lacking proper medical credentials or oversight.” “By posing as sources of emotional support, AI platforms can mislead vulnerable users, especially children, into believing they’re receiving legitimate mental healthcare,” Paxton mentioned. The move lands as consumer-facing AI products face rising questions about how well they protect vulnerable users, and minors in particular, from harmful or graphic material, the risk of compulsive use, and privacy lapses tied to the large volumes of data needed to train and run these systems. Texas’s action follows a separate Senate inquiry into Meta reported by Cryptopolitan earlier on Friday, after internal leaked files suggested the company’s rules allowed its chatbot to engage in “romantic” and “sensual” conversations with users under 18. Senator Josh Hawley told Zuckerberg in a letter that the Senate will probe into the possibility of the tech firm’s generative AI tools enabling harm to children. “Is there anything — ANYTHING — Big Tech won’t do for a quick buck?” Hawley wrote on X. Is there anything – ANYTHING – Big Tech won’t do for a quick buck? Now we learn Meta’s chatbots were programmed to carry on explicit and “sensual” talk with 8 year olds. It’s sick. I’m launching a full investigation to get answers. Big Tech: Leave our kids alone pic.twitter.com/Ki0W94jWfo — Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) August 15, 2025 Meta says that its policies ban harm to children Meta said that its policies ban content that harms children in such ways. It added that Reuters first reported the “internal materials” leaked, which “were and are erroneous and inconsistent with our policies, and have been removed.” Zuckerberg has committed billions toward building “personal superintelligence” and positioning Meta as an “AI leader.” The company has released its Llama family of LLMs and rolled out the Meta chatbot across its social apps. Zuckerberg also described a potential therapeutic use case for the technology. “For people who don’t have a person who’s a therapist, I think everyone will have an AI,” he said in a podcast with Ben Thompson in May. Character.ai makes chatbots with distinct personas and lets users design their own. The platform includes many user-created therapist-like bots. One bot, called “Psychologist,” has recorded over 200 million interactions. The company has also been named in lawsuits brought by families who claim their children were harmed in the real world after using the service. Paxton’s office mentioned that Character.ai and Meta chatbots may impersonate licensed health professionals and invent new credentials, making it seem like the interactions are confidential, even though the companies themselves mention that all conversations get logged. These conversations are also “exploited for targeted advertising and algorithmic development,” Paxton’s office said. Paxton’s office issued a Civil Investigative Demand The attorney general has issued a Civil Investigative Demand requiring the companies to provide information that could show whether they violated laws related to Texas consumer protection. Meta said it marks AI experiences clearly and warns users about limitations. The company added, “We include a disclaimer that responses are generated by AI — not people. These AIs aren’t licensed professionals and our models are designed to direct users to seek qualified medical or safety professionals when appropriate.” Similarly, Character.ai said it uses prominent notices as a reminder that AI personas are not real and should not be viewed as professionals. “The user-created Characters on our site are fictional, they are intended for entertainment, and we have taken robust steps to make that clear,” the company said. The dual struggles, a state probe in Texas and a Senate review in Washington, place fresh pressure on how AI chatbots are built, marketed, and moderated, and on what companies tell users about the limits of automated support.

Ethereum and HBAR remain staples for steady growth, while MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining traction as a hidden presale contender with explosive upside potential. Together with Solana, Litecoin, and PEPE, these tokens form a list of seven cryptos analysts believe are well-positioned for high-multiple returns in the next cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE — Breakout Presale Contender Ethereum and HBAR are strongholds, but analysts say MAGACOIN FINANCE could outperform with 35x growth potential . Its combination of scarcity-driven tokenomics and accelerating whale inflows is pushing MAGACOIN FINANCE onto analyst watchlists as one of 2025’s hottest early-stage opportunities. Already raising millions and with allocations running low, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly emerging as a presale standout for investors seeking high-multiple growth. Also Investors who use PATRIOT50X can secure a 50% EXTRA presale bonus, available for a short time on the platform. Ethereum (ETH) — Market Leader Despite Selloffs Ethereum is currently priced at $4,375.53, down 2.23% in the last 24 hours after facing aggressive selling pressure. Over the past day, ETH has traded in a range between $4,227 and $4,484, reflecting volatility fueled by significant liquidations as investors line up to unstake tokens. Despite these short-term headwinds, Ethereum maintains a market cap above $526 billion, underlining its strength as the second-largest cryptocurrency. Analysts emphasize that while ETH may see near-term fluctuations, its long-term outlook remains intact thanks to strong institutional inflows, over 1.7 million daily transactions, and its critical role in powering DeFi and smart contracts. Hedera (HBAR) — Institutional Utility Play HBAR trades near $0.246, slightly lower after a 2% daily dip. Backed by enterprise-grade partnerships and an average 50-day price of $0.23, Hedera remains resilient even in volatile conditions. With its energy-efficient hashgraph technology and growing use cases in tokenization and payments, HBAR continues to attract institutional adoption, making it a compelling long-term hold. Solana (SOL) — Ecosystem Resilience Solana trades at around $185 following a 3% daily decline but remains well-supported above its 50-day average of $172. With strong DeFi activity, NFT adoption, and upcoming ETF decisions drawing institutional attention, Solana continues to be one of the most watched long-term plays in the market. Litecoin (LTC) — The Veteran Performer Litecoin remains steady at $118, trading within a stable range and comfortably above its 50-day average of $106. As one of the longest-standing cryptocurrencies, LTC is known for its reliability and liquidity, providing a consistent option for investors seeking stability within a diversified portfolio. Shiba Inu (SHIB) — Community-Driven Growth Shiba Inu remains one of the most recognized meme coins, supported by an expansive community and ongoing ecosystem upgrades. Its currently trading around $0.00001267 and its move into Shibarium, its Layer-2 scaling solution, has given it a utility-driven narrative beyond meme status. As adoption grows and token burns accelerate, SHIB is being positioned as a long-term meme asset with significant upside potential. PEPE — Meme Coin with Staying Power PEPE trades around $0.00001067 with over $600 million in daily trading volume, underscoring its continued relevance. Despite volatility, PEPE’s community-driven momentum and liquidity profile make it a speculative but viable addition for long-term investors looking to capture meme coin cycles. Conclusion — Building a Balanced Portfolio Ethereum, with its $526 billion market cap and central role in DeFi, remains the anchor for institutional portfolios. HBAR offers enterprise utility, Solana brings ecosystem growth, Litecoin delivers veteran stability, and PEPE captures speculative upside. But among these, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly highlighted as the hidden gem with 35x potential , making it a strategic addition for investors seeking outsized returns in the 2025 cycle.

The satellite internet service run by Elon Musk’s SpaceX stopped working for thousands of users on Monday night. Reports poured in through Downdetector , the go-to platform for tracking tech outages. Users across the globe said their connections just dropped out, no warning, nothing. Starlink already had a major blackout just two weeks ago, dragging on for hours. According to SpaceX VP of Starlink Engineering Michael Nicolls, it happened because of a “failure of key internal software services that operate the core network.” No updates were shared this time, at least not by press time. SpaceX sends more satellites up as California pushes back That July 24 crash hit right after T-Mobile launched its new Starlink-based service. The carrier promised direct-to-cell connectivity for areas with no signal at all. According to T-Mobile, this new setup should work “in places no carrier towers can reach.” It’s supposed to let phones connect straight to the satellite system without any ground infrastructure. Starlink currently serves over six million users in 140 countries, according to SpaceX’s own website. But the company doesn’t publish any numbers about how many users stick around or how many leave. That means nobody outside SpaceX really knows how stable or profitable the customer base is. What is public, though, is the sheer size of the Starlink fleet. Research from astronomer Jonathan McDowell shows that more than 7,000 broadband satellites are actively working in orbit right now. That’s way more than any other company trying to do the same thing. And SpaceX isn’t stopping. On the same day users were facing problems, SpaceX launched another group of Starlink satellites from Vandenberg Space Force Base in Southern California. The timing was almost too perfect, down on Earth, users were cut off from the internet In space, more satellites were flying out to join the constellation. According to the company’s plans, launches from Vandenberg are expected to double soon, from 50 to around 100 each year. But not everyone is on board. Last Thursday, the California Coastal Commission voted unanimously to block the U.S. Space Force’s application to allow SpaceX to ramp up those launches. The issue? Nobody has properly looked into what that kind of activity could do to the environment. The commission said SpaceX and the Space Force failed to submit reports about the impact of more launches on nearby communities and local wildlife. Noise, vibrations, chemical use; it all adds up. And they’re not willing to greenlight 100 launches a year without answers. This vote directly affects how quickly SpaceX can expand Starlink through Vandenberg. And while that drama was happening, another piece moved in Washington. Donald Trump signed an executive order to weaken environmental regulations that companies like SpaceX say are slowing them down. The new rule is meant to make it easier for commercial space firms to launch rockets without all the red tape. Whether that’ll help Elon in California remains to be seen, since state-level commissions don’t always bow to federal orders. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

The FIU said it will conduct stablecoin-related research via external contractors. It will then compile its findings in December this year before drafting a set of guidelines for stablecoin operators and issuers. Per The Bell Korea , the regulator is likely to recommend amendments to the Specific Financial Information Act, with “significant changes” in store. The South Korean National Assembly Building in Seoul, South Korea. (Source: National Assembly [KOGL Type 1]) South Korean Regulator Readies Stablecoin Regulations The regulator is likely to impose entry restrictions and business conduct regulations. Many of these will likely focus on the security of the assets that underpin any South Korean stablecoins, as well as data reporting criteria. An FIU official said that December’s research report would “serve as a foundation for developing AML response measures in response to changes in the virtual asset industry and the institutionalization of stablecoins.” The official added that the measures would help “improve and supplement the existing system.” The FIU currently plays a key role in policing domestic crypto exchanges and ensuring their AML compliance. And the reorganization appears to suggest it expects to become the top AML regulatory authority for stablecoin issuers, despite plans to scrap its parent organization, the Financial Services Commission (FSC). President Lee Jae-myung has previously announced his intention to do away with the FSC. He wants to merge its operations with those of the finance ministry and the Financial Supervisory Service. President Lee Jae Myung’s approval rating has dropped for the second straight week, sinking to a record low of 51.1 percent, a poll showed Monday. The slide comes amid growing controversy over his Liberation Day pardons. https://t.co/VYWndBDJoZ — The Korea JoongAng Daily (@JoongAngDaily) August 18, 2025 However, recent government plan announcements have made no further mention of scrapping the FSC . And the Blue House has even assigned it crypto-related tasks for 2025. FIU Set for Important Regulatory Role? The FIU’s plans, which involve conducting a study on international stablecoin regulations, appear to suggest the regulator expects to police the industry ahead of the rollout of legislation. Several stablecoin bills are on the agenda at the National Assembly. However, lawmakers are yet to fine-tune the details of these draft laws. They continue to deliberate matters like the possible launch of stablecoin lending services. Critics note that the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and other organizations have warned that stablecoin adoption can lead to increased money laundering risks. The Bell Korea noted that many countries, including the United States, have been “quick to develop countermeasures.” Conversely, it noted, South Korea, is a “latecomer,” in this regard, as it “still lacks a comprehensive system.” The media outlet also added that South Korea “still lacks a clear legal definition of stablecoins.” Thus far, most AML-related legislation (including the Special Financial Transactions Act) and regulations relate to exchanges and crypto wallet operators. Big Businesses Ready to Make Stablecoin Moves While lawmakers are yet to form a firm consensus on stablecoin legislation, both major parties agree that businesses should be allowed to issue or make use of KRW-pegged coins. The headquarters of the South Korean tech giant Naver. (Source: Maskkwon [CC BY-SA 4.0]) Some of the country’s biggest banks and tech firms have responded by registering stablecoin-related trademarks. Others have already launched dedicated stablecoin business units as they await the National Assembly’s green light.

The report, conducted in partnership with The Harris Poll, surveyed 615 developers in the US, South Korea, Norway, Finland, and Sweden in late June and early July. Most of the respondents said AI agents were easing the burden of repetitive or technical work, per the report . Forty-four percent said they were using agents to optimize content and process information at speed, enabling them to focus on more creative responsibilities. Ninety-four percent expect AI to bring down development costs in the long run, though nearly a quarter of the respondents said it remained difficult to quantify return on investment, particularly given the high upfront costs of integration. The video game industry is in crisis The relationship between video game developers and AI hasn’t exactly been rosy. Between 2022 and May 2025, more than 35,000 workers were laid off across the global games business, with large publishers such as Embracer Group, Electronic Arts, Unity, Microsoft , and Sony all cutting staff. According to industry trackers, it is the most sustained wave of job losses in the sector’s history. At Microsoft, which shed around 9,000 gaming jobs, workers and union organizers have accused management of prioritizing investment in AI initiatives over staff retention. In one highly controversial case, about 200 developers at King, the Activision Blizzard subsidiary known for Candy Crush, were reportedly replaced by AI tools they had helped design, sparking outrage among colleagues and industry peers. Unions have become increasingly vocal. Blizzard’s narrative design team last month voted to unionize, one week after workers on the Call of Duty franchise did the same. Opinions are divided on AI as industry ponders way forward While most developers in the Google study cited efficiency gains, most of them still agree that there are some gray areas that need better clarification. 63% of respondents expressed concern over data ownership, with questions unresolved about whether studios or creators hold rights to AI-generated content. The “State of the Game Industry” survey, published in January ahead of the Game Developers Conference, painted a more skeptical picture. It found that more than half of studios were already experimenting with generative AI, but nearly a third of respondents characterized its impact as negative. They warned of homogenized content, algorithmic bias, and potential job erosion. At July’s Develop conference in Brighton, panelists argued that human oversight remained essential to authenticity and inclusion in storytelling, stressing that AI tools should not replace lived experience or cultural nuance. For many workers, AI represents not only a technical shift but a profound restructuring of how games are made and who gets to make them. Unions are expected to expand as staff seek to safeguard pay and creative input. Meanwhile, investors and executives are betting that the cost savings promised by automation will outweigh legal, reputational, and cultural risks.

New installs on Google Play are consistently falling year over year. In July 2025, new installs of X on Google Play fell 44% year over year worldwide, while downloads from Apple’s App Store rose 15%, highlighting a widening gap between the two mobile platforms. TechCrunch reported that the slump on Android is dragging down the service’s overall momentum. Appfigures reports that total mobile downloads in July were down 26% from a year earlier. The picture had looked worse a month prior, when total installs were off by 35% year over year as Android downloads at the time had dropped by nearly half, at 49%. X’s Android app has long been seen as a problem point, with users complaining about crashes and instability. Nikita Bier, recently appointed as X’s head of product and known for growing teen-focused apps like Gas and TBH before selling them, has suggested that the company will tackle Android performance head-on. On X, Bier announced hiring for an “Android Dream Team” charged with rebuilding the Android client. He also said the iOS app just logged a record week for installs, a data point that underscored Apple-side momentum even as Android lagged. Where those missing Android users might be going is not apparent. Bluesky’s growth has cooled, and its Google Play app collected only 119,000 downloads in July, far below the millions who install X on iOS or Android in a typical month. Meta’s Threads, however, has been narrowing the gap with X in daily active users on mobile, suggesting some Android users may be shifting attention there. The reduced installs on Google Play are hurting X revenue Appfigures found that X generated $16.9 million in net revenue in July, down from $18.8 million in March 2025. July was slightly better than June’s $16.8 million, but the broader trend has been hard to ignore. Most of X’s overall revenue still comes from advertising rather than premium subscriptions sold inside the apps. Falling demand for Android likely explains part of the revenue pressure. Another factor is that Grok now offers its own stand-alone app, attracting users who previously paid for X subscriptions mainly to unlock AI features. Those customers may be switching to Grok directly. Appfigures said the July snapshot reflects performance across devices, giving a clear view of how Android and iOS are diverging. Musk’s SpaceX continues expansion despite setbacks Meanwhile, SpaceX’s Starlink service experienced a separate setback. The satellite internet network was reported down for users around the world, according to Downdetector, which flagged issues beginning at about 1:30 p.m. ET. Affected customers described sluggish speeds, drop-offs in connectivity, and, in many cases, total service blackouts. Despite the rough patch, expansion plans are still on the calendar. Cryptopolitan recently reported that SpaceX’s BTC holdings have crossed $1 billion, which is undoubtedly a win for the space firm. SpaceX has also listed Uzbekistan as a 2026 launch market for Starlink on the service’s website, pointing to a new foothold in Central Asia next year. And in a near-term move, Kazakhstan’s government has announced a start date for service. “Starting from 13 August 2025, Starlink will officially begin providing satellite internet services in the territory of the Republic of Kazakhstan.” the Ministry of Digital Development, Innovation and Aerospace Industry of Kazakhstan reported.

The OpenAI CEO told a few reporters in San Francisco that Donald Trump’s latest ban on advanced chips won’t stop China from pushing forward in artificial intelligence. According to CNBC, Sam met journalists over Mediterranean food in the Presidio and laid out how bad the situation really is. “I’m worried about China,” he said. He warned that this isn’t some race where one side pulls ahead and wins. “There’s inference capacity, where China probably can build faster,” Sam said. “There’s research, there’s product; a lot of layers to the whole thing.” He explained that the U.S. is focused on just one piece, blocking chip exports, while China is working on the entire stack. And despite growing controls, Sam doesn’t think any of it is actually helping. “My instinct is that doesn’t work,” he said when asked if fewer GPUs reaching China would be a win. Trump blocks chips, but Sam says the policy is failing Trump, now back in the White House, signed off on a full stop of high-end chip exports to China in April 2025. That went even further than the earlier rules from President Joe Biden, which had already added restrictions to slow China’s access to advanced AI hardware. Trump’s new policy stopped even modified chips, the ones designed to pass Biden’s rules, from going out. But just last week, Washington changed the rules again. Under a new deal, Nvidia and AMD can now sell certain “China-safe” chips again. But they have to give 15% of their China revenue from those sales to the U.S. government. Sam didn’t talk about that deal directly, but he made it clear that trying to manage AI progress through policy alone isn’t realistic. “You can export-control one thing, but maybe not the right thing… maybe people build fabs or find other workarounds,” he said. “I’d love an easy solution,” he added. “But my instinct is: That’s hard.” He made it clear that this isn’t just about the chips. Chinese firms are already working with their own suppliers like Huawei. The controls from Washington haven’t stopped China. If anything, they’ve made Chinese companies move faster. While the U.S. stays dependent on Nvidia and AMD, Chinese labs are building alternatives. China’s rise pushes OpenAI to release new models Sam said that China’s progress in AI also pushed OpenAI to start opening up its own models. For years, the company refused to release full models, choosing to lock everything behind APIs. But now, with China releasing more open tools like DeepSeek, OpenAI is changing direction. “It was clear that if we didn’t do it, the world was gonna head to be mostly built on Chinese open source models,” Sam said. “That was a factor in our decision, for sure. Wasn’t the only one, but that loomed large.” OpenAI just released two new models: gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b. These are its first open-weight models since GPT-2 dropped in 2019. The new ones aren’t fully open source, the training data and source code are still locked, but the weights are now public. That means developers can download and run them, even offline. The goal, Sam said, was to support people building locally-run coding agents. Sam admitted these models won’t blow anyone away. Some developers say they’re missing key features. He didn’t argue. The team built them for one thing only, he said, and if needs change, they’ll adjust. “If the kind of demand shifts in the world,” he said, “you can push it to something else.” Right now, OpenAI is the only major U.S. company going this route. Meta had gone open with its Llama models before, but CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently said they might stop. That puts OpenAI out front, at least for now, as Chinese labs keep releasing flexible tools that anyone can use. Sam once said that locking up models had put OpenAI “on the wrong side of history.” This new decision looks like an effort to fix that. But it’s also a way to keep developers inside OpenAI instead of losing them to Chinese labs offering more freedom.

No damage has been reported yet, but history suggests that extensive losses could occur once the harm has been done. Taking Over Control The cryptocurrency exchange Kraken has temporarily stopped Monero deposits to the platform due to the ongoing 51% attack against the privacy-focused blockchain. This attack is made possible when a single mining entity controls over 50% of the network’s hash rate (the computational power needed to validate transactions), allowing them to double-spend (i.e., unauthorized production and spending of money) and reorder transactions on the blockchain ledger. This was flagged by the exchange on Friday, and as of the time of writing, there has been a new update posted: “Monero (XMR) deposits have been re-enabled and now require 720 confirmations before crediting. Given the current uncertainty around the security of the Monero network due to significant consolidation of hash rate under a single entity, Kraken may halt deposits at any time and delay crediting at its discretion.” The mining pool responsible for the disruption is Qubic, a blockchain that hosts an AI model called AIGarth. According to a post on their blog, this was an experiment they conducted earlier last week, and they claimed this was possible via unique consensus models available on their chain. This was aimed at proving that Monero’s network is not secure enough and that Qubic’s validators should be responsible for securing it going forward. They further stated that the “Monero network’s core functionality remains intact. Its privacy, speed, and usability have not been compromised.” The team behind the blockchain network has not yet confirmed or denied any aftereffects of the attack. At press time, the native token, XMR, trades at around $276, even up 4% on the day, unaffected by the event. Source: CoinMarketCap Previous Examples Of Such Attacks While it’s still early to determine if this controversial attack will have any effects on the blockchain, there have been past scenarios where the consequences have been quite detrimental. Ethereum Classic (ETC), a split from the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain we know today, is the “classic” version of the chain that was initially launched in 2015. Between 2019 and 2020, the network suffered two 51% attacks involving double-spending, resulting in over $6 million in losses. Another spin-off, Bitcoin Gold (BTG), the “user-friendly” alternative to Bitcoin (BTC), underwent a double-spend attack in 2018, resulting in a loss of around $18 million. The majority of this type of attack has subsided in recent years, primarily due to technological advancements, blockchain upgrades, and improvements in consensus models. As noted above, we have yet to see the impact of this most recent network security breach.

Cardano, XRP, Ethereum, Avalanche, and MAGACOIN FINANCE are each drawing attention for unique reasons — from technical setups to community-driven traction. Here’s why they are at the center of discussions for 2025. Cardano Nears the Bull Market Door Cardano (ADA) has been building momentum, gaining nearly 20% last week and more than 30% across two consecutive weeks. The asset briefly flipped Tron, reclaiming the ninth-largest spot in market cap rankings. Analysts point to the $1.25 price level as a critical threshold — what they call the “bull market door.” If ADA sustains above this region, analysts expect a major rally phase that could redefine its valuation in 2025. Historical patterns show ADA facing resistance near this zone in 2022 and 2023, but breaking past it would signal a structural shift. Analyst Dan Gambardello has emphasized that a breakout above this point opens the path to higher levels, with projections running into double digits. Adding to the case, futures market activity has surged, with volumes hitting $7 billion in a single week — the highest in five months. That level of activity highlights growing conviction in ADA as one of the top altcoins to watch closely heading into 2025. XRP Price Stalls After SEC Case Ends Ripple’s XRP settled its long-running legal battle with the U.S. SEC last week, a case that stretched nearly five years. The resolution briefly lifted XRP to $3.38, but it has since retraced to $2.95, leaving many questioning the subdued response. The lack of follow-through suggests that most of the optimism was priced in earlier. Analysts note that XRP surged fivefold in the weeks following Trump’s re-election, anticipating a more crypto-friendly policy stance. With that run-up already in place, the actual case dismissal triggered a “buy the rumor, sell the news” effect. Still, longer-term expectations remain high. Analysts like Dark Defender dismiss the idea that XRP will remain near current levels for long, instead projecting multi-fold gains if adoption accelerates. Many argue that for XRP to move higher, Ripple must convert its regulatory win into practical adoption by financial institutions. With tokenization services and partnerships on the agenda, XRP remains on analysts’ radar as a top altcoin to watch for 2025. Ethereum and Avalanche Strengthen Institutional Appeal Ethereum continues to dominate institutional discussions, with ETH closing above $4,400 — its strongest weekly finish since 2021. A wave of ETF-driven demand has pushed inflows past $2.9 billion in a single week, according to CoinShares. BlackRock’s ETHA product alone now holds nearly $15 billion in ETH. This surge in institutional interest comes alongside record network usage, with July recording over 46 million transactions across stablecoins, DeFi, and Layer 2 solutions. These fundamentals set Ethereum apart as not just the largest altcoin by market cap but also one of the most widely integrated in real-world finance. Analysts suggest that if ETF inflows continue at this pace, Ethereum could be positioned for new all-time highs in the cycle ahead. Avalanche (AVAX), meanwhile, is building its case as a programmable payments platform. Recent developments include a $250 million real-world asset tokenization deal and Visa’s integration for stablecoin settlements across multiple currencies. Daily transactions on the Avalanche network have doubled in the past two weeks, highlighting rising utility even as prices faced pullbacks. Institutional endorsements add weight to Avalanche’s long-term role. Notably, Norway’s $1.7 trillion sovereign wealth fund has indirect exposure through crypto-linked firms tied to AVAX. Although short-term volatility remains, both Ethereum and Avalanche are cited by analysts as top-tier altcoins to monitor for 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE Attracts Thousands of Holders MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly become one of the best altcoins to buy now, drawing thousands of holders with demand rising by the hour. Millions has already flowed in, making it one of the most active launches in the space this year. Analysts highlight MAGACOIN as a standout due to its pace of adoption and fast-rising price traction. With over 12,000 wallets already in, MAGACOIN is being positioned alongside bigger names for 2025 discussions. Its growing visibility across X and Telegram has also fueled urgency among early buyers who see this as the entry point before wider exchange listings. Main Takeaway Cardano, XRP, Ethereum, Avalanche, and MAGACOIN FINANCE are all in focus as altcoins to watch for 2025. Each brings a different driver — from institutional inflows to surging community adoption. For those looking at entry points, MAGACOIN FINANCE is seeing rapid demand right now, with its price gaining traction every hour. Access MAGACOIN FINANCE via the official website.

While Bitcoin is widely regarded as the leading cryptocurrency with long-term stability, Shultz’s calculations indicate that XRP could deliver substantially higher gains under certain scenarios. Bitcoin’s Potential At the time of analysis, Bitcoin was trading near $120,643. A $5,000 investment at this price would purchase approximately 0.041 BTC. If Bitcoin were to reach $1 million per coin within five years, that position would be valued at around $41,400, representing a gain of roughly 730%, or just over eight times the original investment. Although this return is significant, it may not offer the same upside potential as some alternative cryptocurrencies. Influential figures like Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson and former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey have predicted that Bitcoin could surpass $1 million by 2030, supporting its long-term appeal. $5,000 in Bitcoin or XRP?

A $5,000 investment would acquire approximately 1,558 tokens. If XRP were to reach $100 within five years, the investment would be worth about $155,800, more than 30 times the initial price and roughly five times the projected profit from Bitcoin. Shultz emphasized that focusing solely on absolute price targets can be misleading. While Bitcoin’s million-dollar goal captures public attention, XRP’s lower entry price allows for a much higher percentage gain if it achieves substantial growth. For investors seeking maximum returns in a five-year timeframe, XRP presents a compelling case, assuming its price rises significantly. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Is $100 for XRP Realistic? Achieving $100 would require XRP to increase by over 3,000% from its current level. Opinions within the crypto community differ widely. Matthew Brienen , COO at CryptoCharged, considers reaching $100 highly likely by 2030. Conversely, a report by Bitwise projects a more conservative scenario, with XRP potentially reaching only around $29. Some community analysts hold even more aggressive views. Javon Marks suggests XRP could reach $100 within the current year, while Xena claims potential to hit $1,000 per coin, potentially creating more individual millionaires than Bitcoin would at $1 million. Both Bitcoin and XRP offer opportunities for substantial gains, but the scale of potential returns differs. Bitcoin remains the industry leader and carries strong backing from influential figures, yet its current high price limits upside relative to lower-priced assets. XRP, while requiring a dramatic increase to reach $100, could generate far higher returns on a $5,000 investment within the next five years if optimistic forecasts materialize. Investors should consider both the stability of Bitcoin and the high-growth potential of XRP when making strategic decisions.

The company’s aggressive ETH accumulation strategy, led by Tom Lee, mirrors MSTR’s BTC playbook and could unlock staking and DeFi opportunities. Risks include ETH price volatility, share dilution from capital raises, and regulatory uncertainty, making BMNR a high-risk, high-reward investment. I am bullish on BMNR as a leveraged ETH play, believing mass adoption and regulatory clarity could drive substantial shareholder returns over time. Bitmine Immersion Technologies ( BMNR ) has gained a lot of steam as Tom Lee from Fundstrat has transformed what was once a company focused on Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining to a leading Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) treasury company globally. BMNR’s strategy is designed to accumulate ETH through capital raises and strategic purchases and mirror what Michael Saylor has done through Strategy Inc. ( MSTR ). BMNR’s goal is to acquire up to 5% of all the ETH in circulation. While I am not favoring BMNR over holding ETH directly as I currently do, I believe BMNR has the potential for explosive growth as there is leveraged upside potential, which can receive a large premium on the net asset value (NAV) of its ETH holdings. As BMNR acquires more ETH, its NAV will increase, and investors could experience amplified returns if ETH is in an upward trend. If BMNR does reach its goal of owning 5% of the total ETH in circulation, it could enhance network effects and scarcity, which would allow BMNR to outperform the returns of just owning ETH directly, which is reflected in how BTC treasury firms have historically outpaced BTC’s price appreciation. BMNR still maintains some of its prior BTC operations, but the value is becoming more correlated toward ETH, which I am more bullish on because I see BTC as a store of value with minimal to no utility. The move into ETH will provide BMNR with broader crypto ecosystem exposure, which could include large staking rewards and DeFi integrations. As of August 11th, BMNR became the largest ETH treasury globally as it added 316863 ETH over the course of one week, going from 833,137 to 1.15 million, and it is now the 3rd largest crypto treasury globally. As of the current price, BMNR has a NAV of $5.2 billion just on its ETH holdings with a market cap of $6.33 billion. I am bullish on ETH and believe that over the next several years its price per token will have the ability to experience large amounts of appreciation, which is bullish for BMNR as it should trade at a premium to its ETH holdings. BMNR is likely to continue its capital raises, which will expand its NAV and the amount of ETH it holds, which should also lead to tremendous expansion from the levels it’s at today. Seeking Alpha Risks to investing in BMNR Just because I am bullish on ETH and BMNR does not mean that BMNR will produce positive returns in the future. Investing in BMNR is an indirect investment in ETH, as it’s holding 1.15 million ETH with plans to own 5% of the ETH in circulation. BMNR has become the world’s largest holder of ETH, which is still a highly speculative asset that is extremely volatile. If ETH’s price declines, then BMNR could see drastic declines in its share price as it’s the main asset on BMNR’s books. BMRN is frequently issuing new shares using market offerings and public sales, which can lead to significant dilution. As BMNR adds shares to fund its ETH acquisitions, the amount of ETH each share represents could decline and cause the share price to decline in the future. There are also unknown regulatory risks for BMNR as U.S. and global rules could change in the future. There could be risks for ETH as central bank digital currencies may compete with ETH. If mass adoption with ETF doesn’t occur from stablecoins being built on top of it and tokenization of assets becomes a flop, then the utility appeal of ETH will decline, which could cause a massive drop in ETH prices and correlate to large losses for BMNR. Investors should do their own due diligence on ETH and BMNR before allocating any capital toward BMNR, as this is not a traditional equity and it comes with much larger risks. Why I have become very bullish on BMNR BMNR has gone from specializing in immersion-cooled BTC mining to aggressively amassing an ETH treasury under the leadership of Tom Lee, who is a veteran Wall Street analyst and crypto advocate. This strategic pivot has led to substantial capital raises, including a recent expansion of stock offerings to $24.5 billion and their positioning themselves to acquire 5% of the ETH in circulation. BMNR launched its ETH treasury on June 30th, and it's already the largest ETH treasury in the world as it owns 1.15 million ETH with a value of $5.2 billion. BMNR is still operating its ongoing mining operations and hosting services, which provide diversified revenue streams that will complement the ETH focus that BMNR is embarking on. By leveraging equity issuances to fund ETH purchases, BMNR emulates MSTR’s playbook and adapts it to ETH’s smart contract ecosystem, which could unlock staking yields and DeFi integrations to enhance shareholder value. When MSTR started, it was trading at $13.49 while BTC traded for $11,000, and by the end of June 2025, BTC increased by 11x to $118,000 and MSTR increased by 30x to $407.76. BMNR had increased by 9.5x at the end of June, while ETH experienced a 1.5x increase, and the current treasury strategy could lead to larger gains in BMNR’s share price compared to ETH going forward. Bitmine Immersion Technologies ETH is an open-source blockchain platform that is decentralized, which allows end users to create and execute smart contracts and decentralized applications ((dApps)). ETH operates as a peer-to-peer network where participants maintain a shared ledger of transactions without relying on intermediaries like banks or governments, which is secured by a global network of computers operating Ethereum software. The smart contract aspect is a self-executing program stored on the blockchain that automatically runs when predefined conditions are met, which can include transferring funds or executing trades. They power dApps, which can range from decentralized finance platforms to games and social networks. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are designed to maintain a consistent value and bridge traditional finance and crypto by enabling fast, low-cost transactions while preserving stability. ETH has become a primary platform for building and issuing stablecoins due to its widespread adoption. ETH’s smart contract system allows stablecoins to be programmed with automated mechanisms for maintaining their peg, such as collateralization, algorithmic adjustments, or reserves managed via decentralized autonomous organizations. USDC , which is issued by Circle ( CRCL ), is built on ETH because of its secure and scalable environment that supports high liquidity and interoperability. The ERC-20 token standard simplifies creation and integration, which makes it easy for stablecoins to interact with DeFi protocols, exchanges, and wallets on the network. As the leading smart contract blockchain, I believe that ETH will expand its current utilization rate as it is already powering thousands of dApps, DeFi protocols, and stablecoins. There is also the ability to tokenize real-world assets like bonds and real estate, which would position ETH for mainstream integration. We’re seeing mainstream interest surge as BlackRock just purchased an additional $338 million of ETH and SharpLink Gaming ( SBET ) has acquired over $3 billion of ETH since May. There is currently $410 billion worth of value secured on ETH, and the largest institutions are buying large amounts of ETH as more assets become tied to it. I am very bullish on BMNR because it provides leveraged exposure to ETH, and it should trade at a larger premium to NAV in the future. As an ETH Treasury, BMNR can outperform direct ETH holdings as it would generate network effects from its underlying ETH through staking and creating scarcity in the marketplace. While this may sound silly, I believe that BMNR trading as a traditional equity on the NYSE is bullish because it can be bought through standard brokerage accounts, which avoids complexities of crypto exchanges, such as wallet management, private key security, or custody risks. BMNR may also appeal to institutions that don’t want direct exposure to crypto and would rather allocate capital toward an ETH Treasury for exposure to the asset class. The GENIUS Act , which was recently signed into legislation, is the first comprehensive federal regulatory framework for stablecoins, and it aims at fostering innovation in the crypto space. I believe this is bullish for ETH due to its dominant role in the stablecoin ecosystem, and it will pave the way for increased liquidity as ETH will be looked at as a compliant hub for tokenizing real-world assets and payments. We are still in ETH’s infancy, and depending on how widespread the use case gets, ETH could see its price expand considerably, which would be very bullish for BMNR as it should get a levered premium on its trove of ETH. Bitmine Immersion Technologies Conclusion My bull case for BMNR is tied to increased utilization across the ETH ecosystem. The GENIUS Act has paved the way for mass adoption, and we are in the infancy of what ETH can be used for in the future. The past decade has shown us that everything is going digital, and ETH could be the bridge to tokenizing asset markets and stablecoin issuance on ETH, which would encourage institutional adoption. Tom Lee has labeled ETH as the biggest macro trade over the next 10–15 years and believes that it could hit $25,000 per ETH by 2028. An investment in BMNR is very risky, but if mass adoption across decentralized finance platforms occurs, we could see ETH catch a large bid considering BTC is trading for around $118,000 and has limited utility compared to ETH. If this occurs, then there could be a lot of value to be unlocked in shares of BMNR as it is positioned to be the largest holder of ETH and should trade at a premium to its NAV, which could allow investors to experience large gains from buying ETH independently. I am purchasing BMNR as an indirect play on ETH, as I believe this strategy will generate substantial returns for shareholders over the next several years.",ETH-USD|BMNR,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-08-19 00:00:30

The filing , accepted by the SEC on August 15, 2025 under the registrant name Gemini Space Station, Inc., details the registration and supporting exhibits for the deal. The Role Of Ripple In Gemini’s IPO The core of the arrangement is straightforward: Ripple has committed a $75 million secured revolver to a Gemini financing vehicle, with room—subject to performance triggers—to rise to $150 million. The agreement allows borrowings above the base commitment to be funded not only in dollars but, at Gemini’s request and Ripple’s consent, “in the RLUSD equivalent of US Dollars,” explicitly defining RLUSD as Ripple’s US-dollar stablecoin. Minimum draw size is “at a minimum equivalent to $5,000,000,” and the document states for clarity, “For the avoidance of doubt, the Commitment shall not exceed $150,000,000.” Where the filing becomes market-relevant is less about the legal plumbing and more about IPO positioning. Gemini confirms it plans to list on Nasdaq under the ticker GEMI, with Goldman Sachs and Citigroup as lead bookrunners. Proceeds are earmarked for general corporate purposes and repayment of third-party debt—signals that the company is seeking balance-sheet flexibility rather than financing growth solely through equity. The S-1 paints a mixed operating picture heading into the roadshow. For the six months ended June 30, 2025, Gemini posted $68.6 million in revenue and a $282.5 million net loss—worse than the year-earlier period. Still, management is taking the company public into a friendlier tape for crypto listings, following debuts by Bullish and Circle . Broad reach remains a selling point: as of June 30, Gemini cites 14.6 million verified users and $12 billion in assets under custody. Strategically, the Ripple line reads as a liquidity shock-absorber for an issuer operating in a volatile asset class. It gives Gemini the option to tap a traditional dollar facility and, when capacity expands, to draw in RLUSD—folding a stablecoin rail directly into a regulated credit instrument. That is a distinctive pre-IPO narrative hook for investors comparing exchange models and treasury toolkits, especially as the filing positions GEMI alongside Coinbase and the recently listed Bullish as the cohort of US-traded exchanges grows. What’s next? Gemini has not disclosed deal size or pricing. Watch for the first amendment to the S-1 to set an initial range, updated financials, and any refinements to use-of-proceeds and risk disclosures. The SEC docket already shows the full exhibit list—including the Ripple credit agreement—under Accession No. 0001104659-25-079323, confirming the company’s path toward a Nasdaq debut as GEMI once market and regulatory conditions align.

XRP May Visit These Levels Of A Parallel Channel Next In an X post on Sunday, analyst Ali Martinez pointed out how XRP was at risk of observing a further drop if it couldn’t reclaim the $3.3 level. Below was the chart shared by the analyst. In the graph, Martinez highlighted a Parallel Channel that XRP has followed since late last year. A Parallel Channel is a TA pattern that forms whenever the price of an asset consolidates between two parallel trendlines. The upper line of the channel is likely to be a point of resistance, while the lower one that of support. A breakout of either of these bounds can trigger a continuation of the trend in that direction. Related Reading: Institutions Buying The Bitcoin Dip? Coinbase Premium Shoots Up From the chart, it’s visible that the asset slipped below the lower line of the Parallel Channel back in April, but this breakdown lasted only briefly, with the coin swiftly recovering back into the channel. Similarly, the cryptocurrency saw a breakout above the pattern last month, but once again the signal couldn’t sustain as its price returned below the upper line. Since then, XRP has made a couple of retests of this line situated at $3.3, but each attempt has been rejected. On Sunday, the analyst warned that the coin could face a further drawdown if it failed to recover to this level. Today, Martinez quoted the chart, noting that the asset has just lost another support level: $3. This line is located a quarter of the way down the Parallel Channel. Now, what could be next for XRP? According to the analyst, the coin may be heading to $2.6, corresponding to the midway line of the channel, or even $2, which represents its lower bound. These are just the support levels available to the cryptocurrency from a TA perspective. Another major support level could perhaps be hinted at by on-chain data, as Martinez shared in another X post. In the chart, the data for the recent Cost Basis Distribution of XRP is shown. According to this indicator, investors last accumulated around 1.7 million tokens of the cryptocurrency at the $2.81 level. Since the spot price is trading above this mark right now, these holders would be sitting on some gain. Generally, if the market mood is bullish, investors in profit react to retests of their cost basis by buying more. This is because they may look at the drawdown as just a ‘dip.’ Related Reading: Dogecoin Bullish Signal: Whales Buy 2 Billion DOGE The more concentrated a level is with supply, the stronger this reaction is. As such, the $2.81 level with its dense supply could play the role of a major support level for XRP in the event of a retrace to it. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is trading around $2.99, down over 6% in the last week.

Large holders appear focused on long-term positioning, even as retail traders react to price swings and short-term volatility. At the same time, large investors are quietly accumulating MAGACOIN FINANCE, an emerging altcoin analysts say every smart investor must have in their portfolio. This wave of accumulation highlights long-term conviction in leading assets, while retail traders remain cautious during periods of volatility. Ethereum Accumulation Despite Volatility Ethereum (ETH) continues to demonstrate why it is considered the backbone of the crypto market. While short-term volatility and liquidations can unsettle traders, the long-term trend remains positive. Institutions have steadily increased their exposure to Ethereum, with inflows into ETH-based products often surpassing Bitcoin’s. Large investors have also continued accumulating ETH, reinforcing confidence in its future growth. With Ethereum powering the majority of decentralized finance and maintaining the largest share of value locked, many analysts still view it as one of the best altcoins to buy now for long-term portfolios Solana Draws Institutional Inflows Solana (SOL) trades between $181–$195 after profit-taking, but whale and institutional buying continue. Solana continues to attract some of the largest institutional inflows in the altcoin market, with investment products tied to the network consistently ranking among the biggest weekly gainers. Solana continues to draw institutional attention, with new ETFs attracting fresh capital and major funds expanding their holdings. This steady inflow highlights growing confidence in Solana’s long-term role in both staking and DeFi. MAGACOIN FINANCE Picked as the Smart Investment MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining attention alongside Ethereum and Solana as whales and retail investors who are selling established tokens pick it as the next crypto market opportunity. Thousands of smart investors have already bought into the token ahead of the upcoming bull run. Analysts highlight MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the few new projects with structured token limits and growing investor accumulation. A limited-time 50% presale bonus with the code PATRIOT50X has fueled urgency, with investors aiming to secure positions before the token’s supply runs out. Analysts predict MAGACOIN FINANCE will outperform in 2025 and is definitely a must-have for every smart investor hoping to make massive returns. With both whales and smaller buyers active in the project, MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to draw attention as investors look for opportunities beyond established tokens. Conclusion Ethereum and Solana remain whale favorites, but MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly positioning itself as the best altcoin of 2025 , thanks to its capped supply, surging presale activity, and early investor bonuses. For those looking beyond the market’s short-term fear, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the standout choice for long-term growth.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index provides a unique snapshot of investor sentiment, acting as a vital barometer. Recently, this key indicator registered 56, firmly placing it in the ‘Greed’ zone despite a slight dip. What does this mean for you and your crypto journey? What Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Reveal? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , developed by software development platform Alternative, offers a clear numerical representation of market sentiment. It operates on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 signifies “Extreme Fear” and 100 denotes “Extreme Greed.” This index helps investors gauge whether the market is overly optimistic or excessively pessimistic, often serving as a contrarian indicator. When the index leans towards “Extreme Fear,” it might suggest a buying opportunity for brave investors. Conversely, an “Extreme Greed” reading could signal a potential market correction or an opportune time to consider profit-taking. It’s about understanding the crowd’s collective emotion. Decoding Current Crypto Fear & Greed Index Sentiment: Why 56 is Significant As of August 19, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index registered a value of 56. This marks a four-point decrease from the previous day, yet it comfortably remains within the “Greed” territory. A reading of 56 suggests that while some exuberance might have slightly receded, the overall market mood is still positive and confident. This sustained ‘Greed’ level indicates that investors are generally feeling optimistic about cryptocurrency prices. However, it’s a subtle reminder that sentiment can shift quickly. Monitoring these movements provides valuable insights into potential market directions and helps inform your strategy. How Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculate Sentiment? The index is not just a random number; it’s a sophisticated aggregation of several crucial market factors. Each factor contributes a specific weight to the final score, providing a comprehensive view of sentiment. Understanding these components is key to appreciating the index’s utility. Here are the primary factors influencing the Crypto Fear & Greed Index : Volatility (25%): Measures current Bitcoin volatility and maximum drawdowns compared to average values. Higher volatility often correlates with fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Analyzes current market volume and momentum compared to long-term averages. Strong buying volume indicates greed. Social Media (15%): Scans various social media platforms for crypto-related hashtags and analyzes the sentiment of posts. Increased positive mentions can indicate greed. Surveys (15%): Polls a large group of investors to gauge their sentiment directly. (Note: This component is currently paused). Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Assesses Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. A rising dominance can sometimes signal fear in altcoins, as investors flock to perceived safety. Google Trends (10%): Examines search query trends for crypto-related terms. Sudden increases in “Bitcoin price manipulation” searches, for example, could signal fear. Navigating Market Volatility with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index For both seasoned traders and new entrants, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a powerful tool for strategic decision-making. It’s not a buy or sell signal on its own, but rather a guide to understanding the prevailing emotional climate of the market. Using it wisely can help you avoid emotional pitfalls. Actionable Insights: Counter-Trade Opportunities: When the index hits “Extreme Fear,” consider it a potential opportunity to buy when others are panicking. Prudent Profit-Taking: If the index enters “Extreme Greed,” it might be a good time to consider taking some profits or re-evaluating your positions. Risk Management: Use the index to inform your overall risk appetite. High greed could mean higher risk of correction. However, remember that the index is just one tool. Always combine its insights with fundamental analysis, technical indicators, and your personal financial goals. The crypto market remains dynamic and unpredictable. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index provides a compelling window into the collective psyche of the crypto market. Its current reading of 56 in the ‘Greed’ zone highlights an ongoing optimistic sentiment, even with a slight reduction from previous days. By understanding its components and implications, investors can gain a crucial edge in navigating the volatile yet exciting world of digital assets. Stay informed, stay strategic, and let market sentiment guide, not dictate, your decisions. Frequently Asked Questions About the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Here are some common questions about this important market indicator: What does a high Crypto Fear & Greed Index score mean? A high score, typically above 50 and especially above 75, indicates “Greed” or “Extreme Greed.” This suggests that investors are feeling very optimistic and confident about the market, which can sometimes precede a price correction. Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index a reliable buy or sell signal? No, it’s not a direct buy or sell signal. Instead, it’s a sentiment indicator that helps you understand the prevailing emotional state of the market. Many traders use it as a contrarian tool: buying during extreme fear and considering selling during extreme greed. Which factors influence the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The index considers six main factors: volatility, market momentum/volume, social media sentiment, surveys (currently paused), Bitcoin dominance, and Google Trends data. Each factor contributes a specific weight to the overall score. How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? The index is updated daily by Alternative, providing a fresh snapshot of market sentiment for investors to consider. Can I use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index for altcoins? While the index is primarily focused on Bitcoin, as Bitcoin’s dominance is a factor, its general sentiment often reflects the broader cryptocurrency market. However, specific altcoin projects may have their own unique sentiment drivers. Found this analysis of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index insightful?

50309625,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=787207,1755563335,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50309625.jpeg,Starling bank snaps up accounting startup to power SME tax tools,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/starling-bank-snaps-up-accounting-startup/,"Starling Bank has acquired British accounting software startup Ember, aiming to strengthen its suite of services for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The challenger bank plans to offer business clients integrated tax and bookkeeping tools alongside its core banking products. The deal’s financial terms were not disclosed, though sources familiar with the transaction said it was valued at under £10 million (around $13.5 million). Declan Ferguson, Starling’s chief financial officer, described the acquisition as a natural extension of the bank’s existing offerings. He noted that combining invoicing, accounting, and tax software with traditional banking services like loans and credit facilities made strategic sense. Starling braces for new era of tax rules Mergers are crucial for small businesses and self-employed workers in Britain. From next year, HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) will implement new rules forcing about 780,000 sole traders and landlords to update the taxman on their income and expenses every three months rather than annually. The move is part of the government’s Making Tax Digital project. For a small business owner, the pressure to comply will also increase with these new, quarterly filings. By embedding Ember’s tools, Starling aims to make tax compliance painless for its close to 500,000 small business customers. The financial firm’s small-business portfolio has expanded rapidly in recent years. The bank was among the most active lenders under the government-backed schemes to support business through the pandemic, allowing it to develop close ties with small companies and entrepreneurs up and down the country. Ember, founded in 2019, marketed itself as a modern, digital-first accounting platform. It enables entrepreneurs to automate bookkeeping, keep up-to-date with expenses, and handle taxes on a mobile-friendly interface. Last year, the company also raised £5 million via funding led by Valar Ventures — the venture capital firm funded by Peter Thiel and Shapers. Previously, Ember has worked with heavyweights including HSBC, Revolut, Barclays, and Lloyds in banking to provide integrated accounting functionality. These partnerships will, however, phase out by 2026, as Ember becomes part of Starling’s ecosystem. The startup will cease its accounting advisory services as part of the acquisition. There will be the opportunity for around 30 Ember employees to join the financial firm, providing continuity in knowledge. Co-founders Daniel Hogan and Aaron Shaw will join the bank and drive integration. The deal will close Ember’s time as an independent entity, but its technology will now be able to cater to a much broader range of SMEs via Starling’s banking infrastructure. Starling soldiers on despite regulatory setbacks The deal comes at a difficult time for Starling. The bank was fined £29m by regulators in October last year for what was described as “shockingly lax” controls over high-risk customers between September 2011 and November 2013. Certainly, Starling is operating under an FCA voluntary restriction. This action prevents the bank from bringing on certain types of customers until it fixes deficiencies in its compliance systems. Even so, Starling has pursued further products and tech investment. Outside the UK, Starling was said to be eyeing international expansion. Bloomberg reported in June that the bank was considering the purchase of a nationally chartered bank in the United States. It was also reported that Starling had entered talks to hire senior US bankers during the summer to advise on the process, although the bank declined to comment. The lender’s chief financial officer, Declan Ferguson, noted that there was a real opportunity to establish a regulated business model in the US. Starling puts itself out as more than just a digital bank by taking hold of Ember. It’s evolving into a hub for small businesses requiring banking, accounting, and tax services on one platform. The move indicates Starling’s ambition to take on high street banks and fintech competitors such as Tide and Revolut, which are extending their SME offerings. The merger, for small businesses that already were navigating tighter rules, more reporting requirements, and surging costs, could mean simplicity at last.

Recently, the South Korean internet giant Naver made headlines with a significant financial move concerning its WEMIX tokens , highlighting the volatile nature of the crypto market. This event serves as a crucial reminder that even established corporations face unique risks when engaging with cryptocurrencies. What Exactly Happened with Naver’s WEMIX Tokens ? Naver, a household name in South Korea’s tech landscape, has officially written off its holdings of WEMIX tokens . This wasn’t a small adjustment; the company recorded a full impairment of 866,700 WEMIX, which translates to approximately $2.4 million. This substantial write-off occurred in the first half of this year, signaling a notable financial decision. An impairment, in accounting terms, means that the book value of an asset is reduced because its market value has declined below its carrying value. Essentially, Naver acknowledges that its investment in these WEMIX tokens is no longer worth what it initially paid. Why Did Naver Hold WEMIX Tokens in the First Place? Many might wonder why an internet giant like Naver would possess a significant amount of WEMIX tokens . The answer lies in a strategic partnership established back in 2020. Naver acquired these tokens as part of an agreement that designated it a WEMIX Block Partner. This collaboration aimed to explore the potential of blockchain technology and its integration into Naver’s vast ecosystem. Such partnerships are common in the crypto space, where traditional companies seek to leverage decentralized technologies for new services or enhanced user experiences. Therefore, Naver’s initial acquisition of WEMIX tokens was a strategic investment, not merely a speculative one. What Does This Mean for the Future of WEMIX Tokens and the Crypto Market? Naver’s decision to impair its WEMIX tokens after nearly five years raises important questions for the broader digital asset landscape. While specific reasons for the impairment haven’t been fully detailed beyond the financial accounting, it underscores the inherent risks associated with holding volatile cryptocurrencies. For investors and developers in the WEMIX ecosystem, this news serves as a reminder of market fluctuations and corporate strategy shifts. It highlights that even long-term holdings by major entities are subject to re-evaluation based on performance and market conditions. Consequently, the impairment could influence investor sentiment around similar blockchain-based gaming and platform tokens. Lessons Learned from Naver’s WEMIX Tokens Experience This event offers several key takeaways for anyone involved in the crypto space, whether you’re an individual investor or a large corporation considering digital asset integration: Due Diligence is Crucial: Before engaging with any digital asset, thorough research into its fundamentals, team, and market viability is essential. Understanding the project’s long-term vision and potential pitfalls can prevent costly write-offs like those involving WEMIX tokens . Risk Management: Companies and individuals holding cryptocurrencies must have clear strategies for managing potential losses, including impairment policies and diversification. Setting clear entry and exit points is vital. Long-Term Vision vs. Volatility: Even strategic partnerships involving WEMIX tokens or other digital assets can face challenges due to market volatility or evolving business priorities. What seems promising today might require re-evaluation tomorrow. Transparency: Financial reporting like Naver’s impairment provides valuable transparency into corporate crypto holdings, which can influence market sentiment and inform future investment decisions. Naver’s $2.4 million impairment on its WEMIX tokens serves as a powerful illustration of the dynamic and sometimes unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. It highlights that even major corporations are not immune to the financial adjustments required when digital asset values shift. As the crypto world continues to evolve, such events reinforce the importance of cautious investment and robust risk assessment. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What are WEMIX tokens? WEMIX tokens are the native cryptocurrency of the WEMIX platform, a blockchain-based gaming and entertainment ecosystem developed by Wemade. They are used for transactions, governance, and rewards within the ecosystem. 2. Why did Naver acquire WEMIX tokens? Naver acquired WEMIX tokens in 2020 as part of a strategic partnership agreement. This made Naver a WEMIX Block Partner, aiming to explore and integrate blockchain technology into its services. 3. What does “impairment” mean in this context? In accounting, an impairment means that the value of an asset on a company’s balance sheet has decreased below its original cost. Naver’s impairment of WEMIX tokens signifies that the company has reduced the recorded value of its holdings to reflect a decline in their market price. 4. Does this impairment affect the WEMIX platform directly? While Naver’s impairment is a financial decision by one of its partners, it does not directly impact the operational functionality of the WEMIX platform. However, such news from a prominent partner can influence market sentiment and investor confidence in WEMIX tokens. 5. What can we learn from Naver’s decision regarding WEMIX tokens? This event underscores the volatility and risks inherent in cryptocurrency investments, even for large corporations. It highlights the importance of thorough due diligence, robust risk management strategies, and transparency in reporting digital asset holdings.

What Exactly Happened with This Large ETH Withdrawal? In the early hours, a fresh, previously inactive digital wallet initiated and completed a significant transaction. This wallet pulled 15,752 Ethereum tokens directly from FalconX, a prime broker for institutional digital asset trading. The sheer volume of ETH involved, equating to tens of millions of dollars, immediately caught the attention of on-chain analytics platforms, including Onchain Lens, which quickly disseminated the information. Transaction Details: 15,752 ETH moved. Value: Approximately $68.24 million at the time of withdrawal. Origin: FalconX, a well-known institutional trading platform. Destination: A newly created, unidentified wallet. This kind of large ETH withdrawal is not an everyday occurrence. It raises questions about the identity of the recipient and the underlying reasons for such a substantial transfer. Why Does a Massive ETH Withdrawal from FalconX Matter? Understanding the implications of this large ETH withdrawal is crucial for anyone following the crypto market. When institutional platforms like FalconX see such considerable outflows, it can suggest several possibilities, each with different potential impacts: Institutional Reallocation: A large entity, such as a hedge fund or an investment firm, might be moving assets to a different custody solution, preparing for an over-the-counter (OTC) trade, or shifting capital between strategies. This often happens quietly and is part of routine asset management. Security Concerns: While less common for established platforms, sometimes large withdrawals can occur if an entity is moving funds due to perceived security risks or a desire for greater self-custody. However, FalconX is generally considered a secure platform. Market Speculation: The movement could precede a significant market event, such as a large sell-off or a strategic accumulation. Traders often interpret such movements as signals, though correlation does not always imply causation. The lack of immediate public information about the wallet’s owner adds to the intrigue, prompting analysts to delve deeper into the on-chain data for clues. What Are the Potential Market Implications of This ETH Movement? A large ETH withdrawal of this magnitude naturally leads to speculation about its potential impact on Ethereum’s price and broader market sentiment. While one single transaction, even a large one, rarely dictates market trends, it can contribute to a narrative or confirm existing suspicions. For instance, if the funds are being moved to a self-custody wallet with no immediate intent to sell, the impact might be minimal. Conversely, if the wallet is linked to an exchange or a known over-the-counter desk, it could signal an impending large sell order, which might exert downward pressure on ETH’s price. However, it’s equally possible that the funds are being prepared for staking, DeFi participation, or entry into new institutional products. Key Takeaways for Investors: Stay Informed: Monitor on-chain analytics for further movements from this wallet. Avoid Panic: Do not make rash decisions based on a single transaction. Evaluate the broader market context. Diversify: Large individual transactions highlight the volatility and unique dynamics of the crypto market. The crypto community will undoubtedly be watching this wallet closely for any subsequent movements that might reveal its purpose. This event underscores the transparency of blockchain technology, where every significant transaction is publicly visible, even if the parties involved remain anonymous. In conclusion, the recent large ETH withdrawal of $68.24 million from FalconX by a new wallet is a significant on-chain event that demands attention. While the precise reasons remain speculative, such movements are integral to understanding the flow of institutional capital within the crypto ecosystem. Whether it signifies a strategic repositioning, a security measure, or a precursor to market action, its sheer scale makes it a key data point for analysts and investors alike. Keeping an eye on subsequent movements from this wallet will provide further clarity on its ultimate intent and potential market ramifications. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is FalconX? FalconX is a cryptocurrency prime broker that offers institutional investors and trading firms a comprehensive suite of services, including trading, credit, and clearing, for digital assets. It facilitates large-volume transactions for professional clients. Q2: Why is a “newly generated wallet” significant? A newly generated wallet often means it’s a fresh address created specifically for this transaction or for a new entity. It makes it harder to immediately identify the owner compared to movements from known exchange wallets or long-standing institutional addresses. Q3: Could this large ETH withdrawal impact Ethereum’s price? While a single transaction of this size can cause short-term speculation, its long-term impact on Ethereum’s price depends on the ultimate intent of the funds. If they are moved for selling, it could create downward pressure; if for holding, staking, or new products, the impact might be neutral or even positive in the long run. Q4: How can I track such large crypto movements? You can track large crypto movements using on-chain analytics platforms like Etherscan, Arkham Intelligence, or services like Onchain Lens, which monitor and report significant transactions across various blockchains.

Recently, the Altcoin Season Index, a key metric tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), registered 43. This specific reading at 00:27 UTC on August 19, a five-point drop from the previous day, clearly indicates that the market is currently in a Bitcoin Season . But what exactly does this mean for your crypto portfolio? What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? To truly grasp the current market dynamics, it’s essential to understand the Altcoin Season Index. This valuable metric, provided by CoinMarketCap, helps investors gauge whether altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin or vice versa. It specifically excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens, focusing on the pure performance of independent cryptocurrencies. Here’s how it works: The index compares the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin over the past 90 days. For a market to be in an Altcoin Season, a significant majority—at least 75%—of these top 100 altcoins must have outperformed Bitcoin. Conversely, a Bitcoin Season is declared when 25% or fewer of these altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin. The index scores range from 1 to 100, with lower scores indicating a stronger Bitcoin Season. A score of 43, as we’ve seen, firmly places us in this phase. Understanding this index is vital for strategic investment decisions, especially during a pronounced Bitcoin Season . Why Are We in Bitcoin Season Right Now? The current Altcoin Season Index reading of 43 signals a strong period of Bitcoin Season . This trend often emerges when investors gravitate towards Bitcoin, the largest and most established cryptocurrency, as a perceived safe haven or a primary growth driver. Several factors can contribute to this shift: Market Uncertainty: During periods of broader economic or crypto market uncertainty, investors often de-risk by moving funds from more volatile altcoins into Bitcoin. Its larger market capitalization and longer track record offer a sense of stability. Dominance Resurgence: Bitcoin’s dominance, which is its market cap share relative to the total crypto market, tends to increase during these periods. This means a larger portion of new money flowing into crypto goes directly into Bitcoin. Pre-Halving Cycles: Historically, Bitcoin often sees strong performance leading up to its halving events, drawing capital away from altcoins. Institutional Interest: Increased institutional adoption or major positive news specifically related to Bitcoin can also lead to a Bitcoin Season , as large players primarily focus on BTC. The recent drop in the index score from 48 to 43 within a day underscores the rapid shift towards Bitcoin’s dominance, making it a critical time to observe market movements. Navigating the Bitcoin Season: What Does This Mean for Investors? For many crypto enthusiasts, a clear Bitcoin Season presents both opportunities and challenges. It requires a nuanced approach to portfolio management: Focus on Bitcoin: During this period, Bitcoin often offers more stable gains compared to altcoins. Investors might consider increasing their BTC holdings or rebalancing their portfolios to reflect Bitcoin’s stronger performance. Altcoin Caution: While some altcoins might still perform well, the overall trend suggests that a majority will struggle to keep pace with Bitcoin. This doesn’t mean avoiding altcoins entirely, but rather being more selective and cautious. Risk Management: It’s a good time to review your risk exposure. High-cap altcoins might be more resilient than smaller, more speculative ones. Diversification within altcoins, if you choose to hold them, remains important. Market Reassessment: Use this period to research potential altcoins for the next Altcoin Season. Projects with strong fundamentals and innovative technology might be good long-term holds, even if they are underperforming Bitcoin currently. Ultimately, understanding the market’s current phase, especially during a strong Bitcoin Season , empowers investors to make informed decisions and adapt their strategies accordingly. In conclusion, the Altcoin Season Index at 43 unequivocally points to a prevailing Bitcoin Season . This signifies a period where Bitcoin is largely outperforming the broader altcoin market, driven by various market dynamics and investor sentiment. By staying informed about these cycles and adjusting your strategy, you can navigate the crypto landscape more effectively. The crypto market is dynamic, and understanding these shifts is paramount for success. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index is a metric that tracks whether altcoins (cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin) are outperforming Bitcoin. It compares the performance of the top 100 coins over the past 90 days, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens. Q2: How is a Bitcoin Season determined? A Bitcoin Season occurs when 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. The Altcoin Season Index will typically be low, often below 50, during this period. Q3: What does an Altcoin Season Index of 43 signify? An Altcoin Season Index of 43 strongly indicates that the market is currently in a Bitcoin Season . This means Bitcoin is generally performing better than most altcoins, and investor focus has shifted towards BTC. Q4: How should investors adjust their strategy during Bitcoin Season? During a Bitcoin Season , investors might consider increasing their exposure to Bitcoin, being more selective with altcoin investments, and focusing on risk management. It’s a good time to re-evaluate portfolios and potentially rebalance towards BTC dominance. Q5: Does Bitcoin Season mean altcoins will never perform well? No, a Bitcoin Season doesn’t mean altcoins will never perform well. It signifies a current market trend. Altcoins can still see individual pumps or perform well in specific niches, but the broader market trend favors Bitcoin’s outperformance. Market cycles change, and an Altcoin Season may follow.

Ethereum and Chainlink whales have been diversifying into smaller projects while keeping core positions intact. Avalanche whales are also joining this move, signaling a wider trend across altcoins. Analysts note that MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the standout presale, drawing strong interest during this rotation. Whale Rotation Strengthens Presale Demand Over $1.4 billion has been rotated by whales in the past week. Most of this capital still sits in Ethereum, Avalanche, and Chainlink. However, a growing share is now moving into early-stage projects with higher upside. MAGACOIN FINANCE is at the center of this trend. The strategy looks clear. Whales build stability with ETH and AVAX, then use a portion of those gains to target faster growth plays. By spreading risk, they balance safety with exponential upside. This approach explains why MAGACOIN is gaining momentum so quickly. MAGACOIN FINANCE Presale Momentum Builds Early adopters are rushing in as MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a 50% EXTRA BONUS with the code PATRIOT50X, fueling presale momentum. This has created a wave of new attention from both retail investors and whales. Analysts point to MAGACOIN’s strong foundation. The project is built on Ethereum and integrates DeFi staking features. Its smart contract has been certified and is undergoing further audits. These factors make it appealing to conservative whales who want safety, as well as growth-focused investors chasing upside. The demand for Ethereum-based assets has risen due to ETF-driven adoption. This has tightened exchange supply and increased institutional holdings. Since MAGACOIN aligns directly with Ethereum’s ecosystem, it stands to benefit from this growing demand. Projections suggest gains of 43x to 70x, depending on exchange listings and market momentum. Altcoin Cycle Setup This whale rotation is part of a larger altcoin cycle. When blue-chip assets like ETH, AVAX, and LINK rally, whales often recycle profits into new tokens. It allows them to stay ahead of the next breakout. With MAGACOIN positioned as a smaller cap, it fits this pattern perfectly. Whales see it as a chance to ride the next wave before it hits major exchanges. Final Thoughts The trend is clear. Whales are keeping core positions in ETH and LINK while directing fresh capital into MAGACOIN. Avalanche investors are following the same path. With strong fundamentals, presale demand, and whale backing, MAGACOIN FINANCE looks like one of the best crypto presale opportunities in 2025.

50310510,559132,1755565217,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50310510.jpeg,Crypto Funds See $3.75B Weekly Surge – Ethereum Claims 77% of It,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-funds-see-3-75b-weekly-ethereum-77-of-it/,"Global crypto asset investment products saw a significant rebound in investor interest last week, with inflows totaling $3.75 billion, according to CoinShares’ latest fund flows report . The figure marks the fourth-largest weekly inflow on record, highlighting renewed activity following several weeks of muted sentiment across the sector. James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, noted that inflows were heavily concentrated: “Unusually, almost all inflows were directed into a single provider, iShares, and one specific investment product. Following recent price gains, total assets under management reached an all-time high of $244 billion on August 13.” While inflows were widespread across multiple digital assets, Ethereum stood out as the dominant contributor, far surpassing Bitcoin in both weekly and year-to-date (YTD) commitments. Ethereum Leads with Record Inflows Ethereum investment products attracted $2.87 billion last week, accounting for roughly 77% of all inflows during the period. This performance brought Ethereum’s YTD inflows to $11 billion, setting a record and underscoring its growing role in institutional portfolios . The scale of capital moving into Ethereum also meant that, relative to assets under management, inflows represented 29% of total Ethereum AuM, compared with Bitcoin’s 11.6%. By comparison, Bitcoin products recorded $552 million in inflows during the week. Although still a substantial figure, it lagged considerably behind Ethereum. Other altcoins also attracted investor attention, with Solana seeing $176.5 million and XRP recording $125.9 million in inflows. Conversely, some assets experienced outflows : Litecoin lost $400,000, while Toncoin saw $1 million withdrawn. The report emphasized that the surge in Ethereum inflows occurred against a backdrop of elevated trading volumes and price strength, bringing ETH close to its historical highs. It is suggested that the concentration of inflows into Ethereum could reflect growing confidence in its evolving role as the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi) and broader blockchain applications . Regional Breakdown and Market Context Geographically, the United States accounted for 99% of all inflows, totaling $3.73 billion. Other markets recorded modest figures: Canada registered $33.7 million, Hong Kong added $20.9 million, and Australia saw $12.1 million. On the other hand, Brazil and Sweden bucked the trend, recording outflows of $10.6 million and $49.9 million, respectively. The heavy US concentration highlights the ongoing dominance of North American institutions in driving digital asset fund flows. Butterfill as aforementioned already pointed out that while the strong inflow numbers are encouraging, the unusual concentration into a single provider highlights the uneven distribution of institutional demand across the sector. Looking ahead, it should be worth monitoring whether Ethereum can sustain this momentum and whether Bitcoin inflows begin to catch up. The record growth in total assets under management across crypto investment products suggests that despite recent volatility, institutional interest in digital assets continues to expand.

Long-Term Holders Send Mixed Signals,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/is-bitcoin-bull-run-nearing-its-end-long-term-holders-send-mixed-signals/,"Bitcoin’s momentum has slowed after reaching a new all-time high above $124,000 last week. The cryptocurrency has since moved lower, with its price slipping by nearly 10% from that peak. At the time of writing, BTC is trading around $115,424, reflecting a 2.5% decline in the past 24 hours. The retracement has drawn attention to on-chain activity and investor behavior, particularly among long-term holders (LTHs). A CryptoQuant analyst has been monitoring realized profit and loss metrics to gauge whether the current cycle is approaching its peak or if more upside potential remains. Data released by the analyst sheds light on how seasoned holders are reacting to Bitcoin’s latest rally. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulls Must Survive Brutal September Before Q4 Hope, Analyst Predicts Long-Term Holder Trends Across Market Cycles CryptoQuant contributor PelinayPA shared an assessment of Bitcoin’s long-term holder realized profit and loss (RPL) metric, which tracks when investors who have held coins for extended periods decide to sell. According to the analyst, this indicator has historically been reliable in signaling both cycle tops and bottoms. The analysis highlights key phases across multiple market cycles. During the 2017 bull market, a surge in LTH realized profits coincided with Bitcoin’s peak. By contrast, in the 2018–2019 bear market, profit realization slowed dramatically, while losses surfaced, reflecting the market bottom. A similar pattern was observed in 2021, though the profit realization was more gradual, suggesting that selling pressure was spread across the market rather than concentrated in short bursts. When Bitcoin entered the 2022–2023 downturn, realized losses increased significantly as the asset fell into the $15,000–$20,000 range. That period was characterized by panic selling among longer-term holders. In the current market, however, PelinayPA notes that while profit-taking is visible, it remains moderate compared with past peaks. This indicates that, although selling is occurring, it has not yet reached the levels typically associated with a cycle top. What the Current Data Suggests for Bitcoin The current phase of moderate profit realization suggests caution but does not confirm that Bitcoin has fully topped out. PelinayPA explained that: Historically, sharp increases in LTH profit realization (large green spikes) align with bull market tops. Current selling (mid-2025) is measured and gradual, which implies BTC may still be in the late stages of a bull cycle. If LTH selling accelerates, it could mark the next peak. This measured approach by long-term holders could mean that the market retains some room for additional upward movement, provided selling pressure does not intensify. At the same time, the data highlights that a shift toward heavier profit-taking would be an important warning signal for traders and institutions watching the market closely. Related Reading: Bitcoin 30-Day CDD Down: Market Absorbs LTH Selling Without Breaking Support On-chain analytics firms frequently point to these long-term holder behaviors as leading indicators. While Bitcoin’s price action continues to consolidate below its record high, how these investors act in the coming weeks could set the tone for the next stage of the cycle. For now, the data suggests that the rally has not yet reached conditions historically associated with a definitive top, but market participants are advised to watch profit realization closely.

He emphasized Ripple’s banking charter application and substantial XRP holdings as factors that could position the company among the world’s top financial institutions. SWIFT Faces Potential Strain Gilbertie raised concerns about the long-term stability of SWIFT, the decades-old system that enables banks to transmit cross-border payment messages. During an interview on the Paul Barron Show, he indicated that the network could experience significant disruption shortly. According to Gilbertie, Ripple’s technological infrastructure, coupled with its move toward a banking license , could allow it to assume a dominant role in international finance. He highlighted Ripple’s holdings of approximately 40 billion XRP tokens and speculated that if the company secures a banking charter, it could utilize these assets to become one of the largest capitalized banks globally. The CEO underscored that such a shift could introduce efficiencies currently absent in traditional banking systems, including eliminating the need for pre-funding accounts in both sending and receiving countries for cross-border transfers. Blockchain Efficiency and Market Impact He further emphasized the operational advantages blockchain offers for international banking. He suggested that Ripple’s ledger system could unlock significant liquidity currently tied up in banks’ balance sheets. By moving transactions from SWIFT to a blockchain-based network, banks could potentially streamline payments, reduce costs, and improve transparency. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 He noted that as global financial standards such as ISO 20022 are adopted, Ripple’s network may handle an increasing share of cross-border transaction volume, challenging SWIFT’s longstanding dominance. He indicated that early adopters would likely begin public reporting of transaction volumes conducted via blockchain, which could highlight the growing role of distributed ledger technology in financial markets. He also discussed the evolving regulatory landscape for XRP. He predicted that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might approve spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) before the end of the year. His firm previously launched the first leveraged XRP ETF in the United States in April, reflecting growing institutional interest in the digital asset. Market Performance and Short-Term Challenges Despite these positive projections, XRP has experienced recent market volatility. As of August 18, the token traded just below $3.00, but quickly rebounded to $3.06, marking a 3.91% decline over the past week. Analysts have indicated that XRP’s near-term performance will depend on maintaining key technical support levels. Failure to surpass resistance at $3.30 could expose the token to further declines, while preserving support at $2.81 is critical to sustaining its bullish outlook. While currently trading below its July peak of $3.65, XRP remains up more than 430% year-on-year, reflecting strong performance relative to broader market trends. Gilbertie’s perspective highlights the potential for Ripple and XRP to reshape cross-border payments, though near-term price fluctuations continue to present risks for investors.

U.S. President Donald Trump signed the crypto legislation into law last month, much to the appeasement of key players in the blockchain sector . “Let me say, the entire crypto community, for years you were mocked and dismissed and counted out,” the president continued. “You were counted out as little as a year and a half ago—but this signing is a massive validation.” The move reinforces that the GENIUS Act isn’t just symbolic — it’s now becoming the framework for America’s digital asset strategy .

This funding will come through an offering of 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2031, with the primary goal of accelerating its TeraWulf Expansion strategy. This financial maneuver aims to bolster the company’s data center capabilities and support general corporate purposes, as detailed in a Globe Newswire press release. What Does This TeraWulf Expansion Entail? This massive capital injection is not just about growing; it’s about strategic positioning within the competitive Bitcoin mining landscape. TeraWulf’s decision to issue convertible notes highlights a clear intent to scale operations significantly. But what exactly are these notes, and why are they a preferred funding method? Convertible Senior Notes: These are a type of debt instrument that can be converted into a specified number of common shares of the issuing company under certain conditions. For investors, they offer the security of a bond (fixed interest payments) combined with the potential upside of equity (conversion to shares if the stock performs well). Purpose of Funds: The proceeds are earmarked for two critical areas: enhancing data center infrastructure and covering general corporate expenses. This dual focus ensures both physical growth and operational stability. The company is clearly setting its sights on a larger footprint, aiming to capture more of the Bitcoin mining market share. Why is Data Center Expansion Crucial for Bitcoin Mining? For a Bitcoin mining operation like TeraWulf, data centers are the beating heart of their business. These facilities house the powerful mining rigs that solve complex computational puzzles to validate transactions and earn new Bitcoin. Therefore, expanding these centers directly translates to increased mining capacity and and, potentially, higher revenue. The significance of this TeraWulf Expansion can be understood through several lenses: Increased Hash Rate: More data center capacity means more mining rigs can be deployed, leading to a higher ‘hash rate’ – the total computational power used for mining. A higher hash rate improves the chances of solving blocks and earning Bitcoin rewards. Operational Efficiency: Larger, purpose-built data centers often allow for better cooling, more efficient power distribution, and optimized maintenance, all of which reduce operational costs per Bitcoin mined. Strategic Advantage: In a volatile market, companies with robust infrastructure are better positioned to weather price fluctuations and capitalize on favorable conditions. This investment signals TeraWulf’s long-term commitment and confidence in the Bitcoin ecosystem. This move is a strong indicator of TeraWulf’s confidence in the future profitability of Bitcoin mining, even amidst market fluctuations. What Are the Implications of This $850M Raise? Raising such a substantial amount through convertible notes has several implications for TeraWulf, its investors, and the broader Bitcoin mining industry. It demonstrates the company’s ability to attract significant institutional capital, a testament to its perceived growth potential and operational strength. For investors, the 1.00% interest rate offers a steady return, while the conversion feature provides an opportunity to participate in potential equity appreciation. However, it also introduces dilution risk if the notes are converted into shares, which could impact existing shareholders. The successful execution of this TeraWulf Expansion could: Boost Market Position: Solidify TeraWulf’s standing as a major player in the North American Bitcoin mining scene. Enhance Competitiveness: Allow the company to deploy cutting-edge hardware and optimize energy sources, potentially lowering its cost of production. Signal Industry Confidence: Large capital raises like this can inspire confidence across the entire Bitcoin mining sector, suggesting a positive outlook for the industry’s future. This funding round is a clear signal that TeraWulf is gearing up for a significant leap forward. Looking Ahead: The Future of TeraWulf’s Operations The coming years will reveal the full impact of this ambitious funding initiative. TeraWulf’s ability to effectively deploy this capital into state-of-the-art data centers and optimize its operations will be key to its success. The focus on general corporate purposes also suggests a holistic approach to growth, ensuring that all facets of the business are prepared for expansion. As the Bitcoin halving events continue to reduce block rewards, efficiency and scale become paramount for miners. This TeraWulf Expansion positions the company to remain competitive and sustainable in an evolving landscape. Investors and industry observers will be closely watching how TeraWulf leverages these funds to achieve its strategic objectives and contribute to the overall stability and growth of the Bitcoin network. This bold step underscores TeraWulf’s commitment to long-term growth and its belief in the enduring value of Bitcoin mining. Summary: TeraWulf’s Strategic Growth TeraWulf’s announcement to raise $850 million via convertible senior notes marks a pivotal moment for the company. This substantial capital infusion is specifically designed to fuel significant data center expansion and support broader corporate objectives. By strengthening its infrastructure and increasing its mining capacity, TeraWulf aims to solidify its position as a leading Bitcoin miner. This strategic financial move not only reflects the company’s confidence in its future but also highlights the ongoing growth and investment within the digital asset mining sector. It’s an exciting development for both TeraWulf and the wider crypto community. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are convertible senior notes? Convertible senior notes are a type of debt security that pays interest like a bond but can be converted into shares of the issuing company’s common stock under certain conditions, offering investors both income and potential equity upside. Why is TeraWulf raising $850 million? TeraWulf is raising $850 million primarily to fund its data center expansion, which will increase its Bitcoin mining capacity and efficiency. The funds will also be used for general corporate purposes to support overall business growth. How will this expansion impact TeraWulf’s Bitcoin mining operations? The TeraWulf Expansion is expected to significantly increase the company’s hash rate, allowing it to mine more Bitcoin. It should also improve operational efficiency through better infrastructure, potentially reducing costs and enhancing profitability. What are the potential risks for investors in these notes? While convertible notes offer interest payments, potential risks include market volatility affecting the stock price (which impacts conversion value), the company’s ability to execute its expansion plans, and potential dilution for existing shareholders if the notes are converted. Where will TeraWulf’s new data centers be located? While the press release mentions general data center expansion, specific new locations are typically disclosed by the company as part of their detailed expansion plans or quarterly reports. This announcement focuses on the funding mechanism. Did you find this article insightful?

The regulatory agency aims to take cautionary measures before allowing new ETF products to exist in the country. This announcement was made public after the SEC highlighted that it had extended its decision on the 21Shares Core XRP Trust from the set deadline of August 20, adding 60 days, setting the new deadline for October 19. The delay will provide the regulatory agency ample time to seek public opinion on the proposal and assess any regulatory concerns associated with the Exchange Act, typically known as the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The 21Shares Trust initially filed its proposal on February 6, followed by an updated Amendment No. 1 submission on February 12. If the SEC ultimately disapproves of the 21Shares application after the October 19 deadline, it would represent a significant setback in the regulator’s legal review process for this product. The SEC delays making a decision on XRP ETF proposals Like the 21Shares XRP ETF proposal, the SEC has postponed its decisions on Grayscale, CoinShares, and Bitwise XRP ETF filings. The regulator’s new deadline for all these proposals remains October 19, with analysts anticipating the agency may handle them consistent with previous Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF reviews. If this expectation holds, the SEC could issue final decisions on all eight pending spot ETF applications—including Franklin Templeton , REX-Osprey, WisdomTree, and five others—by October 18, the initial final deadline set for these unsettled funds. Speculation also suggests that multiple ETFs, including Solana-based funds, could launch simultaneously, as the SEC has extended its review for Solana ETFs to align with the October deadline. Despite the optimism that a decision will be made soon, BlackRock, the biggest asset manager in the world, announced just recently that it will not apply for an XRP ETF. Other pending applications for cryptocurrencies include Cardano, Hedera, Litecoin, Avalanche, Dogecoin, and PENGU. The SEC extends review of altcoin ETFs A similar approach was applied to several altcoin ETFs and various filings, according to reports from a reliable source, the SEC had extended the deadline for its review period for Truth Social’s Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF. These funds are not the only funds that will expose investors to Bitcoin and Ethereum because the agency had earlier approved Hashdex and Franklin Templeton’s funds, which have similar functions. In addition, before the August 24 deadline, the agency had earlier delayed its decision on the CoinShares Litecoin ETF. Considering the above Scenario, October 23 seems to be the final deadline for the SEC to decide whether to approve or disapprove this fund. Canary Capital and Grayscale are among the firms that have submitted an LTC ETF application. The deadline will also feature the regulatory body’s decision on staking for the 21Shares Ethereum ETF and Grayscale’s Dogecoin ETF. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

In 2021 it was Shiba Inu (SHIB), turning small investments into fortunes. Now, in August 2025, analysts are drawing parallels between SHIB’s legendary run and the rise of MAGACOIN FINANCE. With forecasts projecting up to 18,000% upside, and viral meme momentum colliding with structured tokenomics, early adopters see this as one of the rare chances to ride a new retail wave before allocations vanish. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Why Analysts Are Watching MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly become one of the year’s most talked-about presale tokens. Its appeal lies in the combination of meme-driven virality and scarcity-focused design — two traits that have historically defined breakout tokens. Analysts say MAGACOIN is “engineered” for the kind of exponential growth that could define the 2025 bull cycle, much like SHIB did four years ago. With entry prices still below $0.01, MAGACOIN is being framed as a ground-floor opportunity. Several projection models peg the token at potential multiples of 18,000%, depending on adoption, liquidity at listing, and how aggressively retail and whales pile in once the token goes live. Why the SHIB Comparison Matters The comparison to SHIB isn’t made lightly. SHIB’s early holders enjoyed a 100,000%+ run as the coin went from obscurity to global headlines, fueled entirely by community-driven hype. Analysts argue MAGACOIN FINANCE is in a similar position today — leveraging its political branding, viral marketing, and presale buzz to ignite a massive FOMO loop. If momentum continues, $1,000 invested during the presale could, in bullish scenarios, return $18,000 or more. While not every forecast is this extreme, the alignment of whale interest, retail excitement, and cultural virality makes the SHIB comparison a powerful narrative that’s already spreading across Telegram groups and trading forums. Market Catalysts Driving the Buzz Three factors stand out in MAGACOIN FINANCE’s case: Presale Positioning: Tokens are still cheap, and allocations are disappearing quickly. Investors who remember SHIB’s earliest stages say MAGACOIN’s current entry levels feel “pre-hype,” offering asymmetric upside. Viral Branding: MAGACOIN leans heavily into politics-meets-finance messaging, a cultural narrative that resonates strongly with online communities. This gives it a marketing edge over purely speculative meme tokens. Whale and Retail Convergence: Both whales and grassroots buyers are piling in, creating a unique mix of large-ticket confidence and small-investor excitement. This dual momentum has historically been critical for breakout meme coins. Conclusion — The Next SHIB or Just Hype? MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a presale contender with the kind of explosive upside that has defined past crypto bull markets. Analysts’ projections of up to 18,000% gains underscore the speculative opportunity, while its viral narrative and capped supply structure give it an edge over meme tokens that rely solely on hype. Whether MAGACOIN can truly replicate SHIB’s legendary run will depend on adoption and delivery. But for investors seeking the next meme-driven breakout, the presale represents a window of opportunity that may not last long.

Regulators have issued administrative guidance, effectively initiating a South Korea crypto lending ban on new lending products from exchanges. This move is a crucial step towards safeguarding investors and stabilizing the market. This directive highlights growing concerns over the proliferation of high-risk, leveraged products being offered without adequate investor protections. It’s a clear signal that authorities are prioritizing consumer safety in the rapidly evolving digital asset space. Why the South Korea Crypto Lending Ban? Addressing Key Concerns The primary driver behind the South Korea crypto lending ban is a commitment to mitigate investor losses. Financial regulators observed a concerning trend: crypto exchanges were launching sophisticated lending products that carried substantial risks, often without fully informing users of the potential pitfalls. Here are the core reasons for this decisive action: Investor Protection: Many leveraged products expose investors to magnified losses, particularly in volatile crypto markets. The guidance aims to prevent scenarios where individuals could face severe financial harm. Market Stability: Uncontrolled high-risk offerings can amplify market volatility. By reining in these products, regulators seek to foster a more stable and predictable environment. Lack of Safeguards: Regulators identified a deficit in sufficient safeguards accompanying these new lending services. This left investors vulnerable to opaque terms and potential exploitation. Authorities have made it clear: firms ignoring this guidance will face consequences, including on-site inspections and other supervisory measures. This underscores the seriousness of the South Korea crypto lending ban . What Does the South Korea Crypto Lending Ban Mean for Exchanges? For cryptocurrency exchanges operating in South Korea, this administrative guidance marks a significant shift. They must now immediately halt the development and launch of any new lending products. This directive compels exchanges to: Review Existing Products: While the guidance specifically targets new products, exchanges may feel pressure to review their current offerings to ensure they align with the spirit of the regulation. Prioritize Compliance: Compliance departments will need to work closely with legal teams to understand the full scope of the guidance and implement necessary changes. Innovate Responsibly: The focus will likely shift towards developing more secure, less leveraged products that meet regulatory standards, rather than pushing high-risk options. This proactive stance by regulators demonstrates their intent to maintain a tight grip on the digital asset market, ensuring that growth does not come at the expense of investor well-being. How Does the South Korea Crypto Lending Ban Affect Investors? For investors, the South Korea crypto lending ban is largely a protective measure. While it might limit some high-yield opportunities, it significantly reduces exposure to potentially devastating losses. Investors can expect: Reduced Risk: Fewer highly leveraged and complex lending products will be available, leading to a safer investment landscape. Greater Transparency: As regulators scrutinize offerings, there is an expectation that any future lending products will come with clearer terms and better safeguards. Increased Confidence: Stronger regulatory oversight can instill greater trust in the crypto market, potentially attracting more mainstream participants over time. Ultimately, this guidance aims to foster a healthier investment environment where participants are better protected from the inherent volatility and risks of the crypto space. Broader Implications of the South Korea Crypto Lending Ban The decision by South Korean regulators sends a strong message globally. It highlights a growing trend among jurisdictions to regulate the crypto industry more closely, especially concerning products that mirror traditional financial services but lack similar oversight. This could influence other nations to: Adopt Similar Measures: Other countries might look to South Korea’s approach as a blueprint for managing crypto lending risks. Increase Regulatory Scrutiny: The focus on investor protection could lead to broader discussions about comprehensive frameworks for decentralized finance (DeFi) and other emerging crypto services. Foster Responsible Innovation: Regulators worldwide are balancing innovation with the need for consumer safety, pushing the industry towards more sustainable and compliant growth. The South Korea crypto lending ban is a pivotal moment, underscoring the ongoing global effort to integrate digital assets into a regulated financial system. In conclusion, South Korea’s directive to halt new crypto lending products is a significant regulatory intervention aimed squarely at investor protection and market stability. By addressing concerns about high-risk, leveraged offerings, regulators are sending a clear message to exchanges: responsible innovation is paramount. This move will likely shape the future of crypto product development in the region and may influence regulatory approaches worldwide, ultimately fostering a safer environment for all participants in the digital asset economy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the core reason for the South Korea crypto lending ban? The primary reason is to protect investors from high-risk, leveraged crypto lending products that lack sufficient safeguards, which could lead to significant financial losses and increased market volatility. Does this ban affect existing crypto lending products in South Korea? The administrative guidance specifically directs exchanges to halt the launch of new lending products. While it doesn’t explicitly ban existing ones, it signals increased scrutiny and potential future reviews. What happens if an exchange ignores the South Korea crypto lending ban guidance? Regulators have warned that firms ignoring the guidance and causing user harm will face severe supervisory measures, including on-site inspections and other enforcement actions. How will this impact investor choice in South Korea’s crypto market? While it may limit access to certain high-yield, high-risk products, the ban aims to create a safer environment, potentially increasing overall confidence and attracting more secure investment options in the long run. Is this part of a broader global trend in crypto regulation? Yes, many countries are increasing their regulatory oversight on crypto activities, particularly those that resemble traditional financial services, to enhance investor protection and maintain market integrity.

Recently, a significant report from iM Securities, cited by Money Today, highlighted a crucial development: stablecoins are poised to threaten XRP’s market position as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. This insight offers a compelling look into the shifting power structures within the digital asset space. What’s Driving the Stablecoin Surge? The stablecoin market has experienced explosive growth, now reaching an approximate value of $270 billion. An analyst from the South Korean brokerage firm, iM Securities, points to the anticipated launch of a crypto-friendly Trump 2.0 administration as a key catalyst for this rapid expansion. This political shift is perceived to foster an environment more conducive to digital asset innovation and adoption, particularly for stable, fiat-pegged cryptocurrencies. Policy Influence: A favorable regulatory climate can significantly accelerate market growth. Increased Adoption: Businesses and individuals find stablecoins appealing for transactions due to their predictable value. Market Confidence: Regulatory clarity often boosts investor and user confidence, leading to greater capital inflow. How Do Stablecoins Threaten XRP’s Market Position? The core of the challenge lies in the fundamental difference between stablecoins and volatile assets like XRP. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a 1:1 peg with traditional fiat currencies, such as the US dollar. This peg effectively eliminates price volatility risk, making them highly suitable for various financial activities, especially international remittances and daily transactions. Conversely, XRP’s market position is currently defined by its role as a bridge currency for cross-border payments. However, like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), XRP’s value is subject to significant fluctuations driven by market supply and demand. This inherent volatility makes it less than ideal for situations where price stability is paramount, such as large-scale international transfers where a sudden drop in value could lead to substantial losses for senders or recipients. XRP’s Role in Remittances: A Closer Look While XRP has been championed for its speed and low transaction costs in international remittances, its price volatility presents a practical hurdle. Imagine a business sending a large sum of money across borders using XRP; a significant price swing during the transaction could impact the final received amount. This risk is precisely what stablecoins mitigate. Their consistent value offers a reliable medium of exchange, which is highly attractive for institutional and commercial use cases requiring predictability. The analyst’s warning underscores that while XRP has its strengths, the rise of stablecoins offers a compelling alternative for its primary use case. This competitive pressure could inevitably impact XRP’s market position in the long run. What Does This Mean for XRP’s Future? The growing prominence of stablecoins necessitates a re-evaluation of XRP’s strategy and value proposition. For XRP to maintain or strengthen its market position, it may need to emphasize other unique benefits or adapt to the changing competitive landscape. The market is increasingly prioritizing stability for certain applications, and stablecoins perfectly fit this demand. This trend suggests that while XRP remains a key player, it faces a formidable challenge from a category of digital assets designed specifically to address volatility concerns. The evolving market dynamics mean that investors and users should carefully consider the distinct advantages and disadvantages of each asset. Understanding these differences is crucial for navigating the future of cryptocurrency investments and adoption, especially concerning XRP’s market position and its potential evolution. In conclusion, the rapid expansion of the stablecoin market, fueled by potential policy shifts, presents a significant and crucial threat to XRP’s market position . While XRP has long held a prominent spot, its inherent volatility stands in contrast to the price stability offered by stablecoins, which are becoming increasingly favored for their reliability in international transactions. This competitive pressure highlights the ongoing evolution of the crypto landscape and the need for digital assets to adapt to emerging market demands. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a stablecoin? A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to minimize price volatility. It achieves this by being pegged to a stable asset, like the U.S. dollar, gold, or another fiat currency, typically at a 1:1 ratio. Why are stablecoins growing so rapidly? Stablecoins are growing due to their utility in providing stability in volatile crypto markets, making them ideal for transactions, remittances, and DeFi applications. Anticipated crypto-friendly policies, such as those from a potential Trump 2.0 administration, also contribute to increased confidence and adoption. How does XRP differ from stablecoins? XRP is a cryptocurrency that experiences price fluctuations based on market supply and demand, similar to Bitcoin and Ethereum. Stablecoins, however, are designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency, minimizing volatility. Why might stablecoins be preferred over XRP for international remittances? Stablecoins offer price predictability, which is crucial for international remittances. Their stable value ensures that the amount sent remains consistent throughout the transaction, unlike XRP, whose value can fluctuate significantly, introducing risk for both senders and recipients. Will XRP lose its market position completely? While stablecoins pose a significant challenge, XRP’s future is not entirely predetermined. Its network efficiency and existing partnerships still offer value. However, it will likely face increased competition and may need to adapt its strategy to maintain its relevance and XRP’s market position in the evolving crypto ecosystem.

50311905,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=787222,1755566746,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50311905.jpeg,Figure Technology files for Nasdaq IPO after 22% revenue surge,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/figure-technology-files-for-nasdaq-ipo/,"Blockchain lender Figure Technology Solutions has filed to go public on Nasdaq, following a strong first half of 2025 marked by revenue growth and a return to profitability. The New York-based firm disclosed the plan in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Monday, announcing it will seek to list its shares under the ticker “FIGR.” Goldman Sachs, Jefferies, and Bank of America Securities are set to serve as lead underwriters for the offering. Figure reported $191 million in revenue for the six months ending June 30, a 22.4% increase from last year. The company also posted a $29 million profit, rebounding from a $13 million loss during the first half of 2024. The results reflect growing demand for blockchain-based lending and financial services. Since its founding in 2018, Figure has originated over $16 billion in home equity loans. Figure’s IPO filing emphasized that its blockchain platform allows it to introduce liquidity to traditionally illiquid markets. The company aims to reduce costs and expand access to financial products by tokenizing assets such as loans. Figure Technology joins crypto IPO wave Figure’s IPO is the latest wave of interest in digital asset companies accessing public markets in 2025. Circle, which contains a stablecoin called USDC, staged in January one of the largest stock offerings by a company in the crypto industry, indicating strong investor appetite despite turbulence across broader markets. Last week, the Winklevoss twins’ Gemini exchange filed for an IPO in New York. Analysts expect a wave of blockchain-driven companies—ranging from infrastructure builders to platforms enabling tokenization of virtually any asset—to follow suit in the coming months. This momentum, market watchers say, has been fueled by a change in the regulatory climate. Officials of the Trump administration have been relatively friendly toward digital assets, helping to clear up some of the uncertainty that had hung over businesses involving cryptocurrencies in prior years. Regulations on innovation and investment in blockchain have thus made it easier for enterprises to raise public funding. This atmosphere is remaking Wall Street’s relationship with crypto. Traditional banks, which once shunned blockchain startups, are now committing to underwriting IPOs, offering custody solutions, and backing financing rounds. Three other underwriters on Figure’s IPO, Goldman Sachs, Jefferies, and Bank of America Securities, are also broadening digital asset services offered. Analysts noted that the current wave of listings could shape how investors value blockchain companies going forward. Josef Schuster, the founder of IPOX, said crypto was becoming one of the main pillars of the IPO market and added that, in addition to IPOs, several firms were also pursuing de-SPAC mergers as a quicker route to access capital markets. With Circle’s blowout debut and Gemini’s filing grabbing attention, Figure is entering a market where crypto firms are no longer fringe players. They are becoming one of the fastest-growing categories in US listings, rivaling tech and biotech in size and momentum. Figure aims for IPO with strong leadership and blockchain-focused growth Figure was co-founded in 2018 by Mike Cagney, the prominent fintech entrepreneur who once ran SoFi. Cagney has been an early mover in popularising disruptive fintech for mainstream audiences. Under his leadership at Figure, the company has been among the most aggressive blockchain lenders in the United States. According to a prospectus filed with the IPO, its chairman and chief executive, Kevin Cagney, will have majority voting control once listed. This dual-class share structure will let him remain in control of company strategy, as tech founders at Google and Meta did after their companies went public. Investors say that this structure empowers Cagney to keep the company on a long-term track but also begs questions about shareholder control. Figure had raised $200 million seven months ago, in 2021, placing it at a $3.2 billion valuation. The company has not disclosed how much it intends to be valued in the IPO, but analysts anticipate high demand, with the firm back in the black and at the intersection of fintech and blockchain.

But whereas DOGE gets short-term buzz, the actual hype throughout the crypto space is gathering around Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a growing project that’s stealthily setting itself up as a top contender for 2025. Mutuum Finance token price in presale stage 6 is $0.035. It will rise by 14.29% to $0.04 in presale stage 7. Early investors will receive minimum 400% returns when the token goes live. Mutuum Finance already stands with over $14.6 million raised and over 15250 investors. The other tokens in the meantime just continue trading steadily, offering contrast to the heightened speculation surrounding Dogecoin (DOGE) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Dogecoin Price Prediction: Still Steady, Probable Movements Forward Dogecoin is at about $0.2305 on 16th August 2025, relatively flat in the $0.22–$0.23 price range. Recent technical setups in the golden-cross configurations and whale accumulation have triggered bullish investor sentiment, but limited price action prevails. As traders wait for a break higher over resistance levels like $0.24, stray momentum shifts can be imagined in the near term. Mutuum Finance Presale Flourishes, Receives 95.00 Trust Rating during Audit Mutuum Finance is proving to be very efficient in the DeFi sector. The project has a 95.0/100 trust score, audited and assured by Certik. It is offering a secure platform to perform DeFi transactions. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is combining established lending functionality with the security of a forward-thinking ecosystem that is defined by a clear DeFi focus. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also developing an Ethereum, overcollateralized USD-pegged stablecoin. It will offer long-term liquidity, trust, and stability to any client type. Mutuum Finance Presale Begins Phase 6 Mutuum Finance is gaining traction with its presale rounds closing in a rush. The project is already at phase 6 at $0.035. Its next phase’s price will be 14.29% higher at $0.04. Investment interest is gathering pace with the project having raised more than $14.6 million and already boasting more than 15250 token holders. Enhancing DeFi Security through Giveaway and $50,000 Bug Bounty Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has just announced a recent $100,000 giveaway . 10 lucky winners get $10,000 MUTM tokens. The team also initiated a top 50 token holder leaderboard that will reward bonus tokens to holders. As yet another step towards security of its platform, Mutuum Finance also introduced a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program in partnership with CertiK. It will be rewarding and paying for each bug at four different tiers, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low. The Next Generation of DeFi Lending MUTM gives users an effective and secure double lending channel. Peer-to-Contract model smart contracts render lending human-free. Peer-to-Peer infrastructure enables middleman elimination and gives lenders and borrowers direct access to each other. Dogecoin’s $1 target remains undecided, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is going forward with more promising prospects in the short term. Now at presale stage 6 at $0.035, the price will go up 14.29% to $0.04 at stage 7. Having accumulated over $14.5M from 15300+ investors, a 95.0 CertiK trust score, USD-pegged stablecoin proposals, dual lending structures, and a $100K giveaway, MUTM offers early buy-in opportunities for a potential 400%+ returns post-launch. Momentum is picking up rapidly, so this is a great time to buy before the next price breakout.

U.S. investment bank TD Cowen recently made a bold prediction, suggesting that MicroStrategy (MSTR), often seen as a proxy for Bitcoin investment, could amass an incredible 900,000 Bitcoin by the close of 2027. This projection highlights the growing confidence in MicroStrategy’s unique strategy and the potential for significant Strategy BTC holdings in the coming years. What Drives This Massive Strategy BTC Holdings Projection? TD Cowen has set a price target of $680 for MicroStrategy shares, a significant indicator of their bullish outlook. The firm’s recent acquisition of 430 BTC, valued at $51.4 million through a preferred stock issuance, underscores their continued commitment to Bitcoin accumulation. This substantial purchase further solidifies MicroStrategy’s position as a leading corporate holder of the digital asset. Their consistent buying strategy is a key factor in TD Cowen’s optimistic forecast for future Strategy BTC holdings . Why Does TD Cowen See 900,000 BTC as Achievable? Reaching 900,000 BTC by 2027 would mean MicroStrategy holds approximately 4.3% of Bitcoin’s total supply. TD Cowen points to several powerful catalysts that could drive this ambitious accumulation: Growing Corporate Bitcoin Adoption: More companies are considering or actively adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. This trend could validate MicroStrategy’s pioneering approach. Potential S&P 500 Inclusion: If MicroStrategy were to join the S&P 500, it would significantly boost its visibility and potentially attract more institutional investment, indirectly supporting further Strategy BTC holdings . Advances in Cloud Technology: MicroStrategy’s core business in cloud software continues to evolve, providing a stable revenue stream that can be used for Bitcoin acquisitions. Clearer Tax Treatment for Crypto: As regulatory frameworks mature, clearer tax guidelines could reduce uncertainty for corporate Bitcoin holders, encouraging more companies, including MicroStrategy, to increase their exposure. These factors combine to create a compelling narrative for MicroStrategy’s continued Bitcoin accumulation. The current closing price for MicroStrategy shares on August 18 was $363.60, providing a baseline for these future projections. What Are the Implications of Such Large Strategy BTC Holdings? Should MicroStrategy achieve this monumental goal, the implications for both the company and the broader Bitcoin ecosystem would be profound. Holding such a significant portion of Bitcoin’s supply could: Enhance Bitcoin’s Legitimacy: A major public company holding nearly 5% of Bitcoin’s supply would further legitimize Bitcoin as a global reserve asset. Influence Market Dynamics: While not a majority, such a large holding by one entity could influence market sentiment and potentially reduce supply on exchanges, impacting price dynamics. Solidify MicroStrategy’s Niche: It would cement MicroStrategy’s identity as a primary vehicle for investors seeking indirect Bitcoin exposure, strengthening its unique market position based on its Strategy BTC holdings . This projection isn’t just about MicroStrategy; it’s a testament to the evolving landscape of corporate finance and digital assets. It showcases how a traditional company can successfully pivot and thrive in the new digital economy by embracing Bitcoin. Challenges and Considerations for Strategy BTC Holdings While the outlook is overwhelmingly positive, it is also important to consider potential challenges. Market volatility remains a key factor in the crypto space. Regulatory changes, while potentially beneficial in the long run, could also introduce short-term uncertainties. Furthermore, the ability to consistently acquire such large amounts of Bitcoin without significantly impacting market prices will be a continuous strategic consideration for MicroStrategy. However, MicroStrategy has consistently demonstrated a robust and well-thought-out approach to its Bitcoin acquisition strategy. Their leadership has openly communicated their long-term vision, building trust and confidence among investors in their commitment to increasing Strategy BTC holdings . The Road Ahead: A Bitcoin-Centric Future? TD Cowen’s projection paints a fascinating picture of MicroStrategy’s future. It suggests a future where corporate balance sheets increasingly feature digital assets, with Bitcoin leading the charge. This vision aligns with the broader trend of institutional adoption and the growing recognition of Bitcoin’s value proposition. MicroStrategy’s journey, driven by its aggressive accumulation of Bitcoin, serves as a compelling case study for other corporations contemplating similar moves. The potential for 900,000 Strategy BTC holdings by 2027 is a powerful indicator of the transformative impact Bitcoin could have on traditional finance. In conclusion, TD Cowen’s ambitious projection for MicroStrategy to hold 900,000 BTC by 2027 highlights a significant shift in corporate asset management. Driven by catalysts like increasing corporate adoption, potential S&P 500 inclusion, and clearer regulatory environments, MicroStrategy continues to lead the charge in institutional Bitcoin accumulation. This forecast not only underscores MicroStrategy’s bold strategy but also signals a promising future for Bitcoin’s role in the global financial landscape. The journey towards these massive Strategy BTC holdings will be keenly watched by the entire crypto community. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1.

In collaboration with The Harris Poll, the study highlights the growing dependence on AI in the gaming industry amid rising budgets, extended development timelines, and frequent workforce reductions. The survey, which included 615 developers from the U.S., South Korea, Norway, Finland, and Sweden between late June and early July, found that 87% already use AI tools to streamline and automate their workloads. AI accelerates game development For game studios , the allure of artificial intelligence is simple: It saves time and money and opens new creative horizons. Developers say AI is now used to do work that once took weeks or even months of human labor. Common applications of AI in gaming include debugging complex code, testing game mechanics, and checking for errors that could delay releases. Many studios also use AI to generate dialogue for additional characters, produce realistic character voices, and even design entire in-game worlds—fueling a growing AI-driven competition among developers and studios. Tasks that once required teams of writers, artists, and testers can now be completed far more quickly with AI’s assistance, sparking widespread speculation about the future of gaming. By offloading task-based, or at least repetitive, work onto AI systems, developers can focus on the aspects that define gaming: storylines, characters with depth, game worlds, and in-game innovation. This change is immensely helpful in an industry where gamers crave ever-tighter visuals and more engrossing gameplay. The study found that 44% of respondents already use AI agents to rapidly analyze and optimize huge volumes of data, including text, audio, video, and code. Not only do these agents speed up pipelines, but they also create greater developer empowerment to act quickly. In practice, this makes it possible for content to go from concept to testing and release far more quickly. This speed is crucial for an industry under pressure to deliver bigger, slicker games. Big publishers now invest hundreds of millions of dollars in blockbuster games, many of which take more than five years to make. AI offers a means of shortening these cycles without compromising the quality level. And there is strong confidence in AI’s long-term impact. 94% of surveyed developers expect AI to reduce total development costs sooner or later. With budgets ballooning and profit margins pinching, to a great many in Hollywood, AI is much more than a handy tool; it’s a financial lifeline that could decide which studios live to see the light of the next decade or two. AI adoption sparks cost, legal, and job concerns in gaming and media However, there are also risks associated with the rise of AI. Almost one in four developers found it hard to determine the real return on investment from AI tools. Introducing AI systems comes with a costly investment and an already stretched budget. Even more disturbing is a grey zone of copyright and data ownership. Roughly 63% of respondents were worried about who owns AI-generated content. With laws and licensing systems murky at best, studios could face legal challenges over assets produced with the help of AI tech. The anxiety is not new. Last year, video game performers went on strike along with Hollywood actors, partly based on concerns that AI might eventually replace human effort and diminish pay. Meanwhile, over 10,000 gaming industry jobs were lost globally as sizable studios were downsized or shut down.

A powerful Bitcoin investor, often referred to as a ‘whale’ due to their immense holdings, has just made a striking move, signaling potential confidence in Bitcoin’s trajectory. This significant transaction, involving a large sum of Bitcoin, provides valuable insights into the current market sentiment among major players. Understanding Whale BTC Accumulation: What Does It Mean? When we talk about Whale BTC Accumulation , we are referring to instances where individuals or entities holding vast amounts of Bitcoin acquire even more. These ‘whales’ typically possess enough capital to significantly influence market dynamics with their trades. Their actions are closely watched by analysts and investors alike because they often precede notable market shifts. Market Influence: Whales can move markets due to the sheer volume of their transactions. Sentiment Indicator: Their accumulation often signals a bullish outlook on Bitcoin’s future price. Strategic Positioning: Large buys might indicate long-term conviction rather than short-term speculation. Therefore, observing such large-scale buying activity provides a unique lens through which to understand underlying market forces and potential future trends. Unpacking the Latest FalconX Transaction: A Deep Dive into This Bitcoin Whale Activity The latest episode of significant Whale BTC Accumulation involves an address identified as bc1qgf. This address recently received a staggering 300 BTC, valued at approximately $34.85 million, from FalconX just eight hours ago. This particular transaction was highlighted by Lookonchain on X, a well-known on-chain analytics platform. What makes this even more compelling is the broader context: Over the past month, this same whale has amassed a total of 1,521 BTC. The cumulative value of these holdings stands at an impressive $179.4 million. The average acquisition price for these Bitcoins during this period was $117,921. FalconX, in this scenario, functions as a prime broker, facilitating large-volume institutional trades. This suggests that the whale is likely a sophisticated entity, possibly an institution or a very high-net-worth individual, utilizing professional trading infrastructure to execute such massive transactions discreetly. What Drives Such Enormous Whale BTC Accumulation? The motivation behind such substantial Whale BTC Accumulation is often multifaceted. Generally, these large-scale purchases are not impulsive but are rather strategic decisions based on thorough analysis and a strong belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. For instance, whales might accumulate during periods of market consolidation or perceived dips, viewing them as opportune moments to increase their holdings before an anticipated price surge. Consider these potential drivers: Long-Term Conviction: A strong belief in Bitcoin as a store of value or a hedge against inflation. Strategic Positioning: Anticipation of future market events, such as institutional adoption or regulatory clarity, that could boost Bitcoin’s price. OTC Deals: Utilizing platforms like FalconX for over-the-counter (OTC) trades helps execute large orders without causing immediate market impact, indicating a strategic approach to accumulation. These whales often possess unique market insights or are simply executing a predetermined long-term investment strategy. Implications for the Market: Decoding Whale BTC Accumulation Signals The continuous Whale BTC Accumulation by significant players sends a powerful signal to the broader cryptocurrency market. Such persistent buying can be interpreted as a strong vote of confidence in Bitcoin, potentially influencing the sentiment of retail investors and other institutional players. When whales are actively accumulating, it can suggest that they foresee significant upside potential, which in turn might encourage others to buy. However, it’s also important to consider the dual nature of these movements: Bullish Indicator: Persistent accumulation can support price stability and upward momentum. Potential Volatility: While accumulation is positive, large holdings also mean whales have the power to sell, which could lead to significant price drops if they decide to liquidate. Nevertheless, the current trend of this specific whale’s activity points towards a bullish long-term outlook, reinforcing Bitcoin’s position as a preferred asset for substantial capital deployment. In conclusion, the recent Whale BTC Accumulation by the bc1qgf address via FalconX underscores a significant belief in Bitcoin’s future. This ongoing accumulation, totaling over 1,500 BTC in just one month, highlights the strategic moves of major players in the crypto space. As these large investors continue to position themselves, their actions offer compelling insights into the potential trajectory of the world’s leading cryptocurrency. It serves as a reminder that despite market fluctuations, conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value remains strong among its most substantial holders. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a Bitcoin whale? A Bitcoin whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of Bitcoin, typically enough to significantly influence the market with their buying or selling activities. Their transactions are closely monitored for insights into market trends. What is FalconX and why do whales use it? FalconX is a cryptocurrency prime broker that offers institutional-grade trading, credit, and clearing services. Whales and institutions often use platforms like FalconX for over-the-counter (OTC) transactions, which allows them to execute large orders without impacting the open market price. How does whale accumulation affect Bitcoin’s price? Whale accumulation is generally seen as a bullish signal. It indicates strong demand from large holders, which can support Bitcoin’s price, reduce available supply on exchanges, and foster positive market sentiment. However, their eventual selling could also lead to price drops. What does the average price of $117,921 for this whale’s BTC imply? The average price of $117,921 for this whale’s accumulated BTC indicates that these purchases were made at significantly higher price points than Bitcoin’s recent trading range. This could imply a long-term investment strategy where the whale is not concerned with short-term fluctuations, or it might reflect the nature of OTC deals which sometimes involve premium pricing for large, discreet transactions. Where can I track whale activity? You can track whale activity using on-chain analytics platforms like Lookonchain (as mentioned in the article), Glassnode, CryptoQuant, and Arkham Intelligence.

While established tokens like Litecoin, XRP, TRX, Chainlink, and Stellar remain strong contenders, one presale project — MAGACOIN FINANCE — is quickly becoming the surprise favorite among breakout candidates for 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE — The Breakout Contender Analysts are highlighting a new wave of altcoins with explosive upside, and MAGACOIN FINANCE leads the list. With forecasts of 18,000% ROI, it’s being called one of the most powerful breakout candidates heading into 2025. Backed by whale accumulation, scarcity-driven tokenomics, and rapid presale traction, the project is quickly gaining attention among both retail investors and institutions. Funding inflows are rising sharply, and with allocations running out, momentum is building faster than expected. Analysts suggest that this combination of scarcity and investor conviction could make MAGACOIN FINANCE one of the most impactful early-stage stories of the next market cycle. Litecoin (LTC) — Testing Critical Support Litecoin has dropped slightly by 2.32% and now trades at $118. Although whale participation is less, the retail demand has kept the token at key trendlines. LTC may progress towards $150 in the coming months if retail momentum continues, analysts note. Due to its position as one of the oldest cryptocurrencies in existence, users regard it as credible while its liquidity and a resilient network make it a reliable long-term play. XRP — Consolidating Around $3.00 XRP is nearly $3.05, which is a minor dips consolidation level and strong support at $2.90. Demanding rumor and institutional sensing have buoyed sentiment over XRP’s appraisal as a long-term global payments leader. According to analysts, XRP is one of the only assets that can grow in a bull or corrective phase because it is a settlement token. TRON (TRX) — Steady But Cautious Momentum TRON is stable, trading at $0.349, a tad lower on the day. It remains above the 50-day av. of $0.316. TRX remains part of the discussion in the market because it has a strong transaction volume and a strong blockchain. Analysts think that momentum has slowed down, however, there may still be some upside if the overall altcoin sentiment improves. Chainlink (LINK) — Infrastructure Strength Chainlink price of $25.18 has remained stable following a recent rally on the back of strong partnerships, and continuing infrastructure build-up. With analysts eyeing $26–$30 imminently, LINK continues to be one of the leading altcoins behind DeFi and linking blockchains. As adoption grows, there will always be demand as an oracle provider. Stellar (XLM) — Institutional Interest Holding Ground Stellar is priced at $0.413 after a 2.79% decline but remains supported near the $0.41 level. With institutional interest and real-world payment applications backing its use case, analysts expect Stellar to maintain a moderately bullish outlook. Its role in cross-border payments gives it a strategic place among altcoins positioned for steady growth. Conclusion — Positioning Ahead of the Breakout Litecoin, XRP, TRON, Chainlink, and Stellar all provide unique advantages, from infrastructure strength to institutional adoption. But the emerging narrative points to MAGACOIN FINANCE as the standout contender , with forecasts projecting explosive growth potential. For investors seeking high-multiple upside in 2025, positioning early in these assets could provide the strongest opportunity before the next market surge.

Solana DeFi TVL Soars 30% According to market analysis firm Messari, the total value locked in DeFi on the Solana ecosystem surged by 30.4% quarter-over-quarter, reaching $8.6 billion. This growth solidified Solana’s position as the second-largest network in DeFi TVL. However, the quarter was not without its challenges. Average daily spot decentralized exchange (DEX) volume experienced a sharp decline of 45.4%, dropping to $2.5 billion, attributed to the waning excitement surrounding memecoins. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulls Must Survive Brutal September Before Q4 Hope, Analyst Predicts The stablecoin market on Solana also faced headwinds, with its market cap decreasing by 17.4% to $10.3 billion, positioning it third among networks. A significant portion of this growth earlier in the year was fueled by the launch of the official TRUMP token on January 17, which injected substantial liquidity into the ecosystem and created high-liquidity trading pairs utilizing Circle’s USDC stablecoin. Despite the decline, the stablecoin market’s sustained growth indicates that much of the new capital has remained within the Solana network, according to the firm’s findings. By the end of Q2 2025, USDC’s market cap stood at $7.2 billion, reflecting a 25.2% decline and a 69.5% market share. Meanwhile, Tether’s USDT maintained its position as the second-largest stablecoin on Solana, holding a steady $2.3 billion. Network Activity In terms of staking, Solana’s liquid staking rate rose to 12.2%, an increase of 16.8% from the previous quarter. With 64.8% of SOL’s circulating supply now staked, this growth in liquid staking enhances the DeFi ecosystem, supporting yield-bearing opportunities for SOL holders. Solana’s circulating market cap also grew by 29.8% to $82.8 billion, placing it sixth among all cryptocurrencies, behind Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Tether, XRP, and Binance Coin (BNB). The non-fungible token (NFT) market, however, faced a downturn, with average daily trading volume plummeting by 46.4% to approximately $979,500 in Q2. Despite this decline, Solana’s NFTs continue to lead in creator royalties. Related Reading: Ethereum Hits $4,350 Liquidity Pool: Can Demand Hold? Network activity remained relatively stable, with average daily fee payers decreasing slightly by 1.4% to 3.9 million, while non-vote transactions rose by 4% to 99.1 million. The average transaction fee saw a significant drop of 59.6%, settling at just $0.01. On a broader scale, total staked value hit an all-time high of $102 billion on January 18, coinciding with SOL’s peak price of approximately $295. By the end of Q2, the total staked SOL had increased by 25.2% to $60 billion. Messari’s analysis hints that while the Solana ecosystem is navigating through a phase of “adjustment,” its foundational metrics and continued development might signal a promising outlook for the future. As of this writing, SOL’s price stands at $184.50, recording a 4.4% drop in the past 24 hours. When compared to its $293 record reached earlier this year, SOL’s price trades nearly 40% below.

50313635,559212,1755568825,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50313635.jpeg,Stablecoin Shift: Japan Eyes Approval Of Yen-Backed Token,https://bitcoinist.com/stablecoin-shift-japan-eyes-approval-of-yen-backed-token/,"Japan is inching towards the approval of its first yen-backed stablecoin, with regulators likely to approve it as soon as October. Nikkei reports that the token, named JPYC, will be issued by Tokyo fintech company JPYC and will be backed by the Japanese yen with reserves like bank deposits and government debt. Stablecoin Target Remittances And Corporate Payments The forthcoming launch follows a 2023 revision of Japan’s Financial Services Agency’s legal requirements classifying stablecoins as “currency-denominated assets.” With this regulation, only licensed money transfer companies, trust companies, and banks may issue them. JPYC is in the process of registering as a money transfer company within the month, which will enable selling tokens shortly afterward. The company’s goal is ambitious. Within the next three years, it plans to sell 1 trillion yen’s worth of JPYC, roughly $6.8 billion at the current rate of 147 yen per dollar . Japan to greenlight first yen-based stablecoin. The Financial Services Agency will approve the issuance of Japan’s first yen-denominated stablecoin as early as autumn, with the aim of using it for international remittances and more. — World of Statistics (@stats_feed) August 18, 2025 The tokens might be utilized for cross-border remittances, corporate payments abroad, or trading in decentralized finance markets. News also indicates hedge funds dealing in cryptocurrencies and family offices handling money of rich investors are already evincing interest. Carry Trades Attract Institutional Interest Market observers think that JPYC can also find use in carry trades, which exploit the disparity in interest rates among currencies. That prospect has attracted institutional interest at a point when stablecoins are becoming popular worldwide. Dollar-backed tokens continue to hold sway, with the overall value of all stablecoins recently hitting more than $250 billion. Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC continue to be used the most for trading and settlements. Yet, Japan’s attempt to launch a regulated yen-backed token may signal the way toward increased regional adoption in Asia, where dollar-denominated stablecoin alternatives are being monitored closely. Regulated Path Offers Predictability JPYC’s approval would highlight Japan’s stricter but clearer approach compared to many other countries. Analysts say the framework gives companies more certainty as they test blockchain-based settlement systems without fear of regulatory ambiguity. According to estimates, the global stablecoin market could swell to nearly $4 trillion by 2030, more than 10 times its current size. And if yen-pegged instruments, such as JPYC, gain traction, they could capture some of that growth and resonate with Asian investors looking for alternatives to dollars. The Japanese move also comes as governments across the globe heighten their monitoring of stablecoins due to fears about financial stability.

His message was accompanied by a video featuring Tom Farley, the CEO of Bullish, who spoke extensively about the evolving dynamics of the cryptocurrency market and the increasing role of institutional investors. Farley’s Insights on Bullish and Institutional Engagement In the video , Farley began by outlining the scope of Bullish’s operations. He stated that the company runs both an exchange and a data business, which includes CoinDesk, BD Alpha, and a conference arm. According to him, the company’s core mission centers on servicing institutional clients, with the strategy of aligning its business model to their needs. Farley noted that Bullish currently works with over 1,000 customers, which he emphasized as a significant figure in the still-maturing cryptocurrency industry. He went on to point out that the present environment appears favorable for crypto adoption, citing legislative developments such as the Genius Act from Congress and the Clarity Act from the House. Farley explained that these measures provide clearer pathways for institutions to access and participate in the digital asset space. He contrasted the past decade of cryptocurrency growth, which was largely driven by retail activity, with the emerging trend of large-scale institutional involvement . FINAL WARNING #XRP HOLDERS! pic.twitter.com/KKnbyd1jrU — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) August 16, 2025 Institutional Wave and Its Implications Farley was clear in his assessment that the so-called institutional wave is no longer in its early stages but has already arrived. He described it as an ongoing development whose scale remains to be seen, yet he suggested confidence in its potential. He linked this perspective to the strong reception Bullish has observed in connection with its initial public offering, which he characterized as evidence of significant institutional interest . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This emphasis on institutions entering the market represents a critical shift in the narrative around crypto adoption. Farley underscored that the attention and capital from large financial entities could define the next phase of industry growth, setting it apart from the predominantly retail-led expansion that marked earlier years. Rietveld’s decision to highlight Farley’s comments suggests a view that the entry of institutions into crypto may accelerate developments that retail participants cannot ignore. His statement to XRP holders indicates that he considers the matter urgent and directly relevant to their investment strategies.

When big wallets shift billions, smaller investors usually pay attention — and the patterns right now are hard to miss. XRP is seeing some of the heaviest accumulation in months, SEI has clawed its way back into breakout territory, and MAGACOIN FINANCE has burst onto the scene with one of the fastest-selling presales of 2025. Alongside blue-chip names like Ethereum, Solana, Toncoin, and Avalanche, these tokens are shaping the shortlist of coins that traders say could lead the next bull run. XRP — Whales Absorb the Panic Despite August’s turbulence, XRP’s chart tells a different story behind the scenes. More than 440 million XRP changed hands into whale wallets during recent sell-offs — a sign of quiet confidence from the biggest players. The token currently hovers between $2.95 and $3.14, with analysts eyeing a rebound to the $4.00–$4.47 zone if market sentiment steadies. The thesis is simple: when whales lean in this heavily, they’re often preparing for a breakout. Ripple’s growing role in cross-border payments only strengthens that view. SEI — Quietly Building Momentum SEI isn’t the loudest name in the room, but it’s making noise in the right circles. The Layer-1 token has snapped out of a long downtrend, drawing smart money inflows and renewed optimism from traders. Due to this, market forecasts suggest gains of up to 160%, with targets around $0.90 in 2025. Undoubtedly, EI’s appeal lies in speed and scalability, the same qualities that once propelled Solana. For those who can stomach risk, SEI is emerging as one of the higher-upside plays outside the top 20 coins. MAGACOIN FINANCE — The Crypto Presale That Won’t Slow Down XRP and SEI might be showing strength, but MAGACOIN FINANCE has something neither of them does, which is a crypto presale that’s already rewriting expectations. Wallet activity is surging, allocations are selling out fast, and both retail and whale buyers are jumping in before listings. Analysts project as much as 35x upside, citing MAGACOIN’s viral branding and capped supply as the twin forces behind its rise. Notably, the project blends meme energy with DeFi-style tokenomics, positioning it as the most aggressive new entrant of 2025. It’s not for the faint of heart, but for those chasing asymmetric bets, MAGACOIN is quickly becoming the coin speculators don’t want to miss. Ethereum — Shrinking Supply, Growing Demand Ethereum continues to play its role as the bedrock of DeFi and stablecoin. With exchange balances at multi-year lows and institutional ETFs pulling in steady inflows, ETH is showing the slow, relentless accumulation pattern of a blue-chip asset. So, investors looking for stability with upside still treat the top crypto asset as a must-own. Solana — Proving It’s Not a Fad Solana has had its setbacks, but the network’s developer ecosystem hasn’t slowed. Gaming and NFTs remain strong points, and whale activity is beginning to reflect that optimism. Essentially, SOL still has a seat at the table for traders who want exposure to high-performance chains. Toncoin — The Social Network Play Few projects can tap into an existing user base the size of Telegram’s 800 million accounts. Toncoin does just that. By embedding its wallet directly into the app, TON has turned itself into a native payments and DeFi rail with instant distribution. That kind of reach makes it unique among altcoins. Avalanche — Betting on Infrastructure Avalanche’s subnet architecture keeps attracting builders, giving it a long-term edge as an infrastructure play. After retracing in previous cycles, AVAX now sits undervalued relative to its potential, making it a contrarian bet for investors who prefer the “picks and shovels” side of blockchain. The Bottom Line Each coin on this list offers something different: XRP has whale confidence, SEI is clawing back into form, and Ethereum and Solana bring scale and credibility. Toncoin and Avalanche cover real-world integration and infrastructure growth. But the wildcard is clear: MAGACOIN FINANCE is the new entry that’s turned heads this quarter. It combines an energetic crypto presale frenzy with whale momentum, giving it a unique position on the list of 2025’s best crypto bets. If XRP brings clarity and SEI brings speed, MAGACOIN FINANCE brings the early-stage energy that often sparks the biggest gains.

This innovative concept is gaining traction, promising to enhance network security and unlock new yield opportunities. In a move set to bolster the Ethereum ecosystem, ETH Strategy, a prominent treasury protocol, has announced a pivotal partnership with EtherFi, a leading liquid restaking platform. This collaboration is a game-changer for participants interested in leveraged exposure to Ethereum. Unpacking the ETH Restaking Partnership This exciting alliance brings together two key players in the Ethereum landscape. ETH Strategy operates as a treasury protocol, offering users leveraged exposure to Ethereum (ETH). This means it allows participants to amplify their potential returns on ETH holdings, albeit with associated risks. Their strategic approach aims to optimize capital efficiency within the DeFi space. On the other side, we have EtherFi (ETHFI), an innovative platform focused on ETH restaking . EtherFi distinguishes itself by providing a decentralized, non-custodial liquid restaking service. It allows users to stake their ETH and receive eETH, a liquid restaked token, which can then be used across various DeFi protocols while still earning staking rewards and potential restaking rewards. As part of their new partnership, ETH Strategy will strategically allocate a portion of its treasury funds to EtherFi. This allocation directly supports EtherFi’s operations and contributes to the growing volume of ETH being restaked on the platform. This mutual support strengthens both protocols and enhances the overall robustness of the Ethereum network. Why This ETH Restaking Collaboration Matters The collaboration between ETH Strategy and EtherFi carries significant implications for the broader Ethereum ecosystem. Firstly, it enhances the security of the Ethereum network. By increasing the amount of ETH restaked through EtherFi, more capital is committed to securing various AVSs (Actively Validated Services) built on top of Ethereum, making the network more resilient against attacks. Secondly, this partnership opens up new avenues for yield generation. ETH Strategy’s leveraged exposure, combined with EtherFi’s restaking rewards, could potentially offer attractive returns for participants. It allows for a compounding effect, where initial ETH exposure is amplified, and the underlying assets are simultaneously earning rewards through restaking. This innovative approach to yield optimization is a key benefit. Enhanced Network Security: More ETH committed to restaking strengthens the underlying infrastructure. Optimized Capital Efficiency: ETH Strategy’s leveraged model complements EtherFi’s yield-bearing liquid tokens. Increased Liquidity: EtherFi’s eETH token maintains liquidity for restaked assets, a crucial feature in DeFi. Broader Ecosystem Growth: The partnership fosters innovation and integration within the Ethereum DeFi landscape. Navigating the Future of ETH Restaking The emergence of ETH restaking as a dominant narrative in the Ethereum space signals a maturation of its staking ecosystem. Protocols like EtherFi are at the forefront, pioneering new ways to utilize staked ETH beyond traditional validation. This partnership exemplifies how specialized protocols can synergize to create more robust and rewarding opportunities for users. For individuals and institutions considering participation, understanding the mechanics of both ETH Strategy and EtherFi is crucial. While the potential for amplified returns is appealing, it is essential to conduct thorough due diligence and assess the associated risks, particularly with leveraged positions. The transparency and non-custodial nature of EtherFi’s approach provide a solid foundation for trust, however. This collaboration is a testament to the dynamic and interconnected nature of DeFi. It highlights a trend where specialized protocols are joining forces to build more comprehensive and efficient financial primitives. The future of ETH restaking looks promising, with more innovative partnerships expected to emerge, further solidifying Ethereum’s position as the leading smart contract platform. In conclusion, the strategic partnership between ETH Strategy and EtherFi marks a significant milestone in the evolution of ETH restaking . By combining leveraged exposure with liquid restaking capabilities, this alliance promises to deliver enhanced security, innovative yield opportunities, and greater capital efficiency within the Ethereum ecosystem. It’s an exciting time for those watching the growth of decentralized finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is ETH restaking?

The cryptocurrency world is always dynamic, and recently, a significant event has captured the attention of many: an early Ethereum whale made a substantial move. This transaction highlights the immense wealth accumulated by long-term holders and raises questions about market sentiment. Who is This Ethereum Whale and What Did They Do? On-chain data reveals a major transaction involving an address identified as an early Ethereum whale . This particular investor wallet recently sold a staggering 8,576 ETH, which amounted to approximately $37.02 million at the time of the sale. On-chain analyst @ai_9684xtpa first reported this activity on X, drawing immediate attention from the crypto community. What makes this sale particularly noteworthy is the wallet’s history. Ten years ago, this address received a substantial 20,756 ETH from an Ethereum Foundation-related wallet. The average acquisition price was an astonishingly low $0.875 per ETH. Today, even after this significant sale, the wallet still holds 10,209 ETH, indicating a massive unrealized profit from its initial investment. Initial Acquisition: 20,756 ETH at $0.875 (10 years ago) Recent Sale: 8,576 ETH for $37.02 million Current Holding: 10,209 ETH remaining Despite the connection, the Ethereum Foundation has consistently denied ownership of this specific address, adding a layer of mystery to the identity of this powerful Ethereum whale . Why Do Ethereum Whales Make Such Significant Moves? Understanding the motivations behind large sales by an Ethereum whale is crucial for market participants. These early investors often possess a deep understanding of the market and project cycles. Their actions can sometimes signal broader trends or shifts in confidence. Several reasons might prompt such a substantial sale: Profit Taking: After holding for a decade, the current market price represents an immense profit margin for this investor. Taking profits is a natural financial strategy. Portfolio Rebalancing: Whales may sell off one asset to diversify their holdings, invest in other cryptocurrencies, or allocate funds to traditional assets. Market Outlook: Sometimes, large sales can indicate a whale’s bearish short-term outlook, anticipating a potential market correction. Conversely, they might sell to prepare for future buying opportunities at lower prices. Liquidity Needs: While less common for such large amounts, personal or institutional liquidity needs can also drive sales. It’s important to remember that a single whale’s action, while significant, does not always dictate the entire market’s direction. However, monitoring these moves provides valuable insight into the flow of capital within the ecosystem. What Are the Market Implications of This Ethereum Whale Activity? When an Ethereum whale sells such a large quantity of ETH, it inevitably creates ripples across the market. In the short term, a sudden influx of supply can exert downward pressure on prices, especially if liquidity is thin. However, the Ethereum market is vast and resilient, often absorbing such sales without catastrophic impact. The psychological impact on retail investors can be more pronounced. News of a major sale by an early holder might trigger fear or uncertainty, leading some to reconsider their own positions. Conversely, strong buying demand can quickly absorb the supply, demonstrating market strength. For Ethereum, the long-term outlook remains tied to its fundamental developments, network upgrades, and increasing utility. While a large sale like this grabs headlines, the continuous growth of DeFi, NFTs, and Layer 2 solutions built on Ethereum often overshadows individual transactions in the grand scheme. Key Takeaways from the Ethereum Whale Sale Monitor On-Chain Data: Tools tracking whale movements offer valuable insights into potential market shifts. Understand Context: A single sale is a data point, not the entire picture. Consider the broader market trends and Ethereum’s fundamentals. Long-Term Perspective: Early investor moves, while impactful, are part of the market’s natural cycle. Ethereum’s robust ecosystem continues to evolve. This substantial sale by an early Ethereum whale serves as a vivid reminder of the incredible wealth creation potential within the crypto space. It also underscores the importance of staying informed about significant on-chain movements and their potential, albeit often temporary, effects on market dynamics. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is an Ethereum whale? An Ethereum whale refers to an individual or entity holding a very large amount of ETH, enough to potentially influence market prices through their buying or selling activities. Why is this particular ETH sale significant? This sale is significant because it involves an early investor who acquired ETH at a remarkably low price ($0.875) ten years ago. The sheer volume ($37.02 million) and the historical context make it a noteworthy event in the crypto community. Does a whale sale always cause a market crash? No, a whale sale does not always cause a market crash. While large sales can create short-term price pressure, the broader market’s liquidity, demand, and overall sentiment often determine the long-term impact. The Ethereum market is quite resilient. How can I track Ethereum whale movements? You can track Ethereum whale movements using on-chain analytics platforms and blockchain explorers. These tools provide transparency into large transactions and wallet activities, helping you monitor significant flows of ETH. What is the Ethereum Foundation’s role in this? The wallet that initially sent ETH to this address was described as ‘Ethereum Foundation-related.’ However, the Ethereum Foundation has publicly denied direct ownership or control over this specific address, adding to the mystery of the whale’s identity.

In a new YouTube analysis focused on altcoin rotation, he frames DOGE as a top-10 laggard that has yet to print a new all-time high this cycle—precisely the kind of setup that has historically preceded its biggest moves. Dogecoin Could Still Rip 500% This Cycle The analyst’s core thesis is structural rather than narrative-driven: Dogecoin advances in compressed bursts, with most of the cycle’s gains arriving in just a handful of outsized monthly candles. “If you look at it on the monthly… the majority of Doge’s move happens in like two different monthly pops,” he says, citing prior surges of “six, seven hundred percent,” followed by another consolidation and a second leg of roughly “five hundred percent.” By contrast, the largest single monthly gain so far this cycle sits near “about 150%,” a magnitude he views as small relative to DOGE’s historical blow-off dynamics. From a momentum perspective, he highlights a looming inflection on high-timeframe oscillators: “The monthly RSI is potentially about to cross bullish also,” adding that DOGE has “either wicked or got close to the oversold area” twice on the monthly. In his read, those conditions have coincided with DOGE’s most explosive phases: “The oversold area is when all the violent price action happens on the monthly or the weekly… for cryptos generally.” Related Reading: After Monero Hit, Qubic Group Puts Dogecoin On Target List Price mapping and targets are explicit. Assuming a repeat of DOGE’s typical impulse size, the analyst sketches a 500% scenario that would “take us up to like $1.40,” with a staged take-profit ladder beginning “at like $1.18.” He stresses this is a path consistent with DOGE’s historical cadence rather than a call on exact timing: the coin tends to grind, then erupt, compressing multiple hundreds of percentage points into one or two monthly candles. The setup he prefers is rooted in range structure and risk-reward. Across majors and large-cap alts, he observes a similar pattern: form a base, run to a range high, retrace to the base, and compress. “At the bottom of the range is where the best risk-reward is,” he notes, emphasizing that asymmetric entries come when price returns to prior support and sentiment is fragile. He applies the same logic to DOGE, arguing the current structure resembles past pre-acceleration phases rather than distribution. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bullish Signal: Whales Buy 2 Billion DOGE Rotation is the second pillar of the call. The analyst expects capital to continue sliding down the risk curve from Bitcoin into large-cap altcoins and then into high-beta names like DOGE. He points out that even a modest replication of recent capital flows into a single top-10 asset can reprice peers dramatically, and he uses market-cap arithmetic to illustrate the point. With Dogecoin around the mid-$30 billion range by his count, a few hundred billion dollars rotating across the complex—as seen elsewhere this cycle—would imply multi-fold upside for laggards. “That’s where market cap has a bit of an issue in crypto,” he cautions, but the example underlines how quickly prices can gap when liquidity chases momentum. The crux of the trade, he argues, is to stay aligned with the prevailing trend and use pullbacks to build long exposure: “Pullbacks are for buying in trending bull markets and that is what we’re in.” In his framework, the invalidation sits below established range lows, while the upside tails are long if DOGE repeats its signature monthly expansions. As for timing, he refrains from precision. Instead, he reiterates the behavioral pattern: DOGE’s cycle gains typically arrive in a short, violent window after prolonged compression. With a potential monthly RSI turn, a still-muted largest monthly candle compared to prior cycles, and a wider backdrop of alt rotation, he concludes that the conditions for Dogecoin’s next act are falling into place. “It’s probably crazy season,” he concluded, adding that investors who wait for unambiguous confirmation often find “when it’s happened, it’s too late.” At press time, DOGE traded at $0.2217.

Metaplanet Has Expanded Its Bitcoin Treasury Holdings As revealed by Metaplanet president Simon Gerovich in a new post on X, the company has acquired another 775 BTC. The purchase occurred at an average price of $120,006 per token, meaning that the firm spent a total of $93 million on the stack. This buy has taken Metaplanet’s holdings to 18,888 BTC, with a total cost basis of $1.94 billion. At the current price, the company’s reserve is worth around $2.17 billion, implying a positive unrealized gain of just under 12%. CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has shared a chart that shows how the firm’s buys have looked since it adopted a treasury strategy last year: The latest acquisition has come after the firm last week reported that Q2 2025 was its strongest quarter ever, with huge turnarounds occurring in ordinary profit and net income. Though, despite this performance, the stock price of Gerovich’s company remains 50% down since the all-time high (ATH) set back in June. The OG Bitcoin treasury company, Strategy , has also just unveiled a new purchase. According to Chairman Michael Saylor , the acquisition has involved 430 BTC bought for a total of $51.4 million. This has taken the total reserve of the company to 629,376 BTC with a cumulative cost of $46.15 billion. Saylor usually hints at purchases a day in advance by posting the Strategy BTC portfolio tracker with a cryptic caption. This time was no different, as the chairman made a post on Sunday sharing the tracker with the words: “Insufficient Orange.” Strategy is currently the largest holder of the cryptocurrency among both companies and governments. Here is a chart shared by institutional DeFi solutions provider Sentora in its report on BTC treasuries, which puts into perspective how the firm compares to Metaplanet and others: As displayed in the graph, Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings are significantly higher than those of the next largest holder, the US government. The difference is more gradual from there, with third-placed China sitting just $1 billion under the US. Metaplanet is all the way down in the thirteenth position, but if its accumulation remains as consistent as it has been lately, it might be able to climb up a couple of spots in the near future. BTC Price While treasury companies may be busy accumulating Bitcoin, the asset’s price has plunged to the $115,100 mark.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Metaplanet|Metaplanet Bitcoin,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-19 03:00:43

Analysts Compare It to SHIB’s Explosive Run,https://timestabloid.com/could-magacoin-finance-deliver-1000x-returns-analysts/,"The crypto market is moving again, and this time it isn’t just about Bitcoin or Ethereum. Following years of dominance by Ethereum and Bitcoin, attention is shifting toward early-stage projects that combine scarcity, strong community backing, and surging retail demand. MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly gained traction, with many suggesting it could mirror the explosive rallies that made tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu household names among investors. Ethereum and Bitcoin Still Dominate Ethereum is trading around the $4,200 mark, and Bitcoin continues to hold steady after recent highs. Both remain the giants of crypto, with billions flowing in from institutions. But here’s the truth: the days of seeing a 100x return on ETH or BTC are long gone. They’re stable, sure, but they’re no longer life-changing plays for the average investor. That’s why so many eyes are shifting toward newer, smaller coins with real upside — and MAGACOIN FINANCE is topping that list. Analysts Compare MAGACOIN FINANCE to SHIB’s Run Analysts are drawing comparisons between MAGACOIN FINANCE and Shiba Inu’s legendary breakout, noting that early-stage positioning, capped supply, and accelerating whale inflows give it a similar setup. With funding milestones already surpassed and demand rising, market watchers suggest MAGACOIN FINANCE could become one of the best altcoins of 2025 , with projections pointing to a possible 1000x upside . Just like SHIB rewarded its early believers with massive returns, experts believe MAGACOIN FINANCE has the same explosive ingredients — only this time, the window for early entry is still open. Why Timing Matters Crypto history has proven one thing: early movers win big. The people who bought Shiba Inu in its presale saw unbelievable returns, while latecomers caught only the scraps. Right now, MAGACOIN FINANCE is in that early sweet spot — enough traction to show it’s real, but still cheap enough that average investors can load up. Analysts calling it one of the best altcoins to buy now aren’t just hyping it — they’re pointing to so many factors which have in the past determine the winners and losers in the crypto market. Conclusion Ethereum and Bitcoin may stay safe bets, but the chance to see explosive growth lies elsewhere. With talk of 1000x upside and comparisons to SHIB’s legendary run, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being spotlighted as the best altcoin to buy now for anyone who doesn’t want to miss the next breakout. For traders on the lookout for their first breakout in the crypto market, analysts say MAGACOIN FINANCE has what it takes to deliver.

This growing backlog of validators seeking to exit their staked positions has captured the attention of the crypto community, raising questions about its implications for the network and the broader market. This situation highlights the dynamic nature of a proof-of-stake blockchain. Understanding the ETH Unstaking Queue Phenomenon Recent data highlights a remarkable surge in the ETH unstaking queue , reaching a record 910,461 ETH, valued at approximately $3.91 billion. This figure, reported by Wu Blockchain citing validator tracking site validatorqueue, represents the largest accumulation of exit requests since Ethereum transitioned to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) with the Merge and the subsequent Shapella upgrade enabled withdrawals. When validators decide to withdraw their staked Ether, they enter this queue, awaiting processing based on network capacity. The length of this queue is not static; it fluctuates based on the number of validators wishing to exit and the network’s processing capabilities. Ethereum is designed to handle these withdrawals in a controlled manner. This controlled release mechanism ensures that the network remains stable and secure, even during periods of high demand for unstaking, preventing sudden shocks to the system. Why Are Validators Joining the ETH Unstaking Queue? Exploring the Reasons Several factors can contribute to validators joining the ETH unstaking queue . Market Volatility: Periods of significant price swings or bearish market sentiment can prompt some validators to re-evaluate their investment strategies. They might seek to reduce their exposure or reallocate capital. Profitability Adjustments: Changes in staking rewards, operational costs, or the availability of more attractive yields in other DeFi protocols can influence a validator’s decision to unstake. Portfolio Rebalancing: Many large stakers or institutional participants regularly adjust their crypto portfolios. Unstaking ETH might be part of a broader rebalancing strategy. Operational Needs: Validators might need access to their funds for various reasons, including covering operational expenses, personal liquidity, or exiting the validator business entirely. It’s important to note that joining the queue does not automatically imply a bearish outlook. It often reflects strategic financial decisions or a natural cycle within the staking ecosystem. How Does the Unstaking Process Work on Ethereum? Ethereum’s design includes a structured process for unstaking to maintain network stability and security. Validators must explicitly signal their intent to exit, after which they enter the exit queue. The network processes these requests in a controlled manner, preventing sudden, large-scale withdrawals that could impact liquidity or the integrity of the consensus mechanism. The number of validators that can exit per epoch (a 6.4-minute period) is capped, ensuring an orderly release of staked ETH. This mechanism balances validator flexibility with network integrity. The current size of the ETH unstaking queue directly impacts the waiting time for validators, which can range from days to weeks, depending on the volume of pending requests. This design prevents a “bank run” scenario on the staking pool. Potential Impacts of a Growing ETH Unstaking Queue A substantial ETH unstaking queue can have various implications for the Ethereum ecosystem and its participants. Market Dynamics: While a large volume of unlocked ETH could potentially increase selling pressure, historical data suggests that a significant portion is often restaked, redeployed into other DeFi protocols, or simply held. The market typically absorbs these releases without major disruption. Validator Behavior: The queue length can influence new validators considering staking. A longer wait time for exit might deter some potential participants. However, the overall appeal of Ethereum staking remains strong due to its fundamental role in securing the network. Network Perception: While a long queue might appear concerning, it also demonstrates the network’s ability to manage withdrawals effectively and maintain its security mechanisms. It shows that the system is working exactly as designed, providing a controlled exit path for participants. This transparency builds trust in the protocol. Actionable Insights for Ethereum Stakers and Investors For those involved in or considering Ethereum staking, understanding the ETH unstaking queue is crucial. Monitor Queue Lengths: Keep an eye on validator queue metrics from reliable sources like validatorqueue.info to gauge current wait times for unstaking. Understand Your Strategy: If you are a validator, factor potential exit times into your liquidity planning. For investors, understand that ETH unstaking is a normal part of the PoS cycle and not necessarily a bearish signal. Stay Informed: Follow official Ethereum development updates and reputable crypto news sources to stay abreast of network changes and market trends. Conclusion: A Sign of Maturity, Not Alarm The record-breaking ETH unstaking queue , while significant in raw numbers, should be viewed within the broader context of Ethereum’s evolving Proof-of-Stake model. It highlights the flexibility offered to validators and the network’s capacity to manage large-scale movements of capital. Rather than a sign of distress, it represents a mature, functional system where participants can freely manage their staked assets. This ongoing process is vital for the health, decentralization, and long-term stability of the Ethereum blockchain. The network continues to prove its resilience and adaptability. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the ETH unstaking queue? A1: The ETH unstaking queue is a waiting list for validators who wish to withdraw their staked Ethereum (ETH) from the network. After the Shapella upgrade, validators can signal their intent to exit, and their requests are processed in a controlled manner. Q2: Why has the ETH unstaking queue reached a record high? A2: The queue can grow due to various factors, including market volatility prompting rebalancing, changes in staking profitability, portfolio adjustments by large stakers, or individual operational needs requiring access to funds. Q3: How long does it take to unstake ETH? A3: The time it takes to unstake ETH depends on the length of the queue and the network’s processing capacity. It can range from a few days to several weeks, as Ethereum caps the number of validators that can exit per epoch to maintain stability. Q4: Does a large unstaking queue impact ETH’s price? A4: While a large volume of unlocked ETH could theoretically increase selling pressure, historical data shows that much of the unstaked ETH is often restaked, redeployed into other DeFi protocols, or simply held. The market typically absorbs these releases without significant disruption. Q5: Is a long ETH unstaking queue a bad sign for Ethereum? A5: Not necessarily. A long queue indicates a high demand for unstaking, but it also demonstrates that Ethereum’s withdrawal mechanism is functioning as designed, managing large capital movements in a controlled and secure manner. It’s a sign of a mature and resilient network. Did you find this analysis helpful?

U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF products, alongside their Ethereum counterparts, recorded significant net outflows on August 18. This development marked the second consecutive day of such movements, drawing attention from investors and market observers alike. Understanding Recent U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETF Movements On August 18, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF products collectively registered a net outflow of $121.73 million. This trend signals a period of investor caution, following a similar pattern from the previous trading day. Analyzing these figures helps us understand the immediate sentiment within the crypto market. Several key players in the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF space were impacted: BlackRock’s IBIT led the outflows, experiencing a significant $68.64 million departure. ARK Invest’s ARKB also saw substantial outflows, totaling $65.75 million. Interestingly, Bitwise’s BITB bucked the trend, recording a modest $12.66 million inflow, indicating some diversified investor interest. Ethereum ETFs Also Witness Withdrawals It wasn’t just Bitcoin that felt the pressure; U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs also faced considerable withdrawals. These products collectively saw a net outflow of $196.34 million, mirroring the consecutive outflow days observed in their Bitcoin counterparts. This indicates a broader trend across major digital asset ETFs. The Ethereum ETF landscape saw outflows from multiple funds: BlackRock’s ETHA was hit hardest, with $86.87 million in outflows. Fidelity’s FETH followed closely, registering $78.40 million in net withdrawals. Other notable outflows included Grayscale’s ETHE ($18.70 million), Franklin Templeton’s EZET ($6.63 million), VanEck’s ETHV ($4.80 million), and Bitwise’s ETHW ($0.94 million). The remaining Ethereum ETFs reported no change in their holdings for the day. This suggests a concentrated outflow from specific major players in the market. What Drives These Significant ETF Outflows? Understanding why these outflows occur is crucial for investors. Several factors can contribute to a decrease in holdings for U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF and Ethereum ETF products. These movements are often a reflection of the broader market environment and investor behavior. Common reasons for such trends include: Market Sentiment: Broader cryptocurrency market trends often influence ETF flows. If there’s a general downturn or uncertainty, investors might pull back their capital. Profit-Taking: After periods of significant gains, some investors may choose to realize profits, leading to redemptions from their ETF holdings. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic indicators, such as interest rate changes or inflation concerns, can push investors towards perceived safer assets, away from more volatile investments like crypto ETFs. Regulatory Landscape: Shifting regulatory discussions or uncertainties surrounding digital assets can also impact investor confidence in these products. These outflows highlight the dynamic nature of the digital asset market, where investor behavior can rapidly respond to various internal and external cues. Navigating the Landscape of U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs For those invested in or considering U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF products, recent outflows serve as a reminder of market volatility. It is essential to monitor these trends, but also to consider the broader context. While two consecutive days of outflows are noteworthy, they do not necessarily indicate a long-term bearish trend. ETF flows are a snapshot of daily activity, influenced by a multitude of factors. Investors should: Diversify Portfolios: Avoid putting all investments into a single asset class, even within crypto. Spreading investments can mitigate risks. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, regulatory updates, and economic indicators. Knowledge empowers better decision-making. Consider Long-Term Goals: Short-term fluctuations are common in the crypto space. Focus on your long-term investment strategy rather than reacting to every daily change. The emergence of a U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF has provided new avenues for traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin. However, with this accessibility comes the need for informed and strategic decision-making. The recent net outflows from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF and Ethereum ETF products on August 18 highlight the ever-present volatility and responsiveness of the digital asset market. While specific funds like BlackRock’s IBIT and ETHA saw significant withdrawals, it’s crucial to view these movements within the broader context of market dynamics and investor sentiment. Staying informed and maintaining a balanced perspective are key to navigating the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency investments. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF? A U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF is an exchange-traded fund that directly holds Bitcoin, allowing investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without actually owning the cryptocurrency itself. It trades on traditional stock exchanges. Why are ETF outflows significant? ETF outflows are significant because they indicate that more shares of the fund are being redeemed than created, meaning investors are pulling money out. This can reflect a negative sentiment towards the underlying assets or broader market conditions. Are these outflows common for crypto ETFs? Yes, daily inflows and outflows are common for all types of ETFs, including crypto ETFs. The crypto market is known for its volatility, so larger fluctuations in ETF flows can occur in response to market news or price movements. How can investors stay informed about ETF trends? Investors can stay informed by regularly checking financial news outlets, market data providers, and official reports from ETF issuers. Following reputable crypto analysts and financial journalists can also provide valuable insights. Did you find this analysis of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF outflows insightful?

Interestingly, the surge was almost entirely tied to iShares and one particular product under its umbrella. With market prices pushing higher, total assets under management (AuM) reached a historic peak of $244 billion on August 13. Amidst this momentum, Ethereum continued to steal the show. ETH Inflows Smash Records In its latest edition of ‘Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report,’ CoinShares revealed that Ethereum attracted a record $2.87 billion in inflows last week, which accounted for 77% of total market inflows. This pushed its year-to-date figure to a whopping $11 billion. Ethereum’s inflows also dominate relative to assets under management, as it made up 29% compared to Bitcoin’s 11.6%. Inflows into Bitcoin reached $552 million, comparatively smaller than Ethereum’s haul. Short-bitcoin investment vehicles nevertheless gained traction, securing an additional $4 million. Investors continued spreading capital across other assets. For instance, Solana brought in $176.5 million, XRP $125.9 million, followed by Sui at $11.3 million, Chainlink at $1.2 million, and Cardano with $0.8 million. Multi-asset products managed a minor $0.4 million inflow. However, not all assets fared equally. Litecoin experienced outflows of $0.4 million, while Ton registered the steepest reversal, with $1 million withdrawn from funds during the same period. Of the $3.73 billion inflows, the US captured nearly all – about 99%. Other countries contributed smaller portions. Canada followed with $33.7 million, alongside Hong Kong’s $20.9 million and Australia’s $12.1 million. Switzerland also contributed $4.2 million. On the other hand, Sweden reported $49.9 million in outflows, while Brazil recorded $10.6 million exiting investment products over the past week. The subsequent week, however, painted a different picture as markets slid sharply. Crypto Markets Face Fresh Sell-Off Digital asset markets faced turbulence on 18th August as Bitcoin fell from $118K to $115K and Ethereum also dropped from $4,500 to $4,300, triggering over $400 million in long liquidations. The sell-off extended last week’s decline, when Bitcoin retreated 5% from all-time highs amid $1 billion in DeFi liquidations and profit-taking. Funding rates had already hinted at stress, with BTC perpetuals softening since Friday. Deribit’s funding rate, above 20% for most of last week, turned negative by Saturday and echoed a pattern seen before the August 1 drop to $112K. With Jackson Hole looming, QCP Capital stated that traders view the move as pre-event de-risking. Options markets now tilt bearish, and puts are favored across maturities. Still, corporate buyers remain active. Tokyo-listed Metaplanet, for one, added 775 BTC over the weekend.

For traders engaging in derivatives, understanding the concept of crypto perpetual futures liquidation is absolutely crucial. This process can lead to substantial, sudden losses for those who trade with leverage. Grasping the mechanics behind these liquidations is vital for anyone participating in the high-stakes futures market. What Exactly is Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation? Crypto perpetual futures liquidation occurs when a trader’s leveraged position is forcibly closed by an exchange. This action happens because the trader’s margin balance has fallen below a predefined maintenance margin requirement. Exchanges initiate these liquidations automatically to prevent a trader’s account balance from going negative and to ensure that potential losses are covered. Perpetual futures contracts are a unique type of derivative. They allow traders to speculate on a cryptocurrency’s future price without needing to own the underlying asset directly. Unlike traditional futures contracts, perpetual futures have no expiry date. This feature, combined with the use of leverage, makes them incredibly popular but also inherently risky. When market prices move sharply against a trader’s position, especially with high leverage, liquidation becomes a very real and often sudden threat. The Shocking Breakdown: 24-Hour Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation The past 24 hours have witnessed a significant volume of crypto perpetual futures liquidation across several major cryptocurrencies. These figures clearly highlight the market’s recent volatility and the profound impact on leveraged positions. Many traders, particularly those holding long positions, faced unexpected and immediate closures of their trades. Bitcoin (BTC): A staggering $64.81 million in BTC perpetual futures was liquidated. A vast majority, specifically 79.87%, were long positions. This indicates a sharp downturn in Bitcoin’s price, catching bullish traders by surprise. Ethereum (ETH): Ethereum saw the largest liquidation volume, totaling an astonishing $173.52 million. Of this substantial amount, 68.68% were long positions. ETH’s recent price action clearly triggered significant losses for those betting on its upward movement. Solana (SOL): Solana also experienced considerable liquidations, amounting to $20.94 million. An overwhelming 85.02% of these were long positions, showcasing a strong negative price swing for SOL in a short period. These compelling figures underscore the inherent and magnified risks of trading perpetual futures. Even experienced traders can face liquidation if they do not manage their risk effectively. The market’s often unpredictable nature means that sudden price drops can wipe out highly leveraged positions with alarming speed. Why Do These Liquidations Happen So Quickly? Liquidations are a direct and unavoidable consequence of combining leverage with market volatility. When traders utilize leverage, they essentially borrow funds to amplify their potential trading power. While this can dramatically magnify profits during favorable market movements, it equally magnifies losses when the market turns unfavorable. A relatively small price movement against a highly leveraged position can quickly deplete the initial margin a trader has put up. Cryptocurrency exchanges maintain a “maintenance margin” level for all leveraged positions. If your position’s value drops to this critical point, the exchange will typically issue a margin call, requesting you to add more funds. If you fail to add additional capital, or if the price continues to move unfavorably, the exchange automatically liquidates your position. This automated process is designed to protect both the exchange and other traders from significant financial losses. Understanding this fundamental mechanism is absolutely vital to avoid sudden crypto perpetual futures liquidation . Smart Strategies for Navigating Crypto Futures How can traders better manage the substantial risks associated with crypto perpetual futures liquidation ? Effective risk management is not just important; it is paramount. Traders should always meticulously consider the amount of leverage they are using. Higher leverage invariably means a higher and more immediate risk of liquidation. It is often advisable, especially for beginners, to start with significantly lower leverage. Implementing strict stop-loss orders is another crucial and proactive strategy. A stop-loss order automatically closes your position when the price reaches a predetermined, unfavorable level. This action effectively limits potential losses before a full liquidation can occur. Diversifying your portfolio and avoiding the temptation to put all your capital into one highly leveraged trade can also significantly mitigate overall risk. Furthermore, continuously educating yourself on market analysis and understanding broader macroeconomic factors that influence crypto prices can provide a distinct edge in these volatile markets. The recent wave of crypto perpetual futures liquidation serves as a powerful and undeniable reminder of the inherent volatility and magnified risks within the digital asset market. While perpetual futures undoubtedly offer exciting opportunities for amplified gains, they simultaneously demand a rigorous and disciplined approach to risk management. Traders must prioritize a deep understanding of leverage, diligently setting appropriate stop-losses, and continuously monitoring dynamic market conditions to protect their hard-earned capital. Staying informed, exercising extreme caution, and adhering to a well-defined trading plan are unequivocally key to navigating these turbulent waters successfully. Frequently Asked Questions About Crypto Futures Liquidation Here are some common questions about this critical market event: What causes crypto perpetual futures liquidation? Liquidations primarily occur when a trader’s leveraged position loses enough value that their margin balance falls below the exchange’s maintenance margin requirement, often due to significant price movements against their trade. How can I avoid liquidation in futures trading? To minimize liquidation risk, use lower leverage, set stop-loss orders, maintain sufficient margin, and continuously monitor market conditions. What is the difference between perpetual futures and traditional futures? The main difference is that perpetual futures have no expiry date, allowing traders to hold positions indefinitely as long as they meet margin requirements, unlike traditional futures which have a set settlement date. Why were long positions liquidated more in the last 24 hours? The higher liquidation of long positions suggests a dominant downward price movement across BTC, ETH, and SOL during that period, causing traders betting on price increases to lose their margin. Is crypto futures trading suitable for beginners? Crypto futures trading, especially with leverage, carries high risk and is generally not recommended for beginners without a thorough understanding of market dynamics, risk management, and the specific mechanics of derivatives.

In 2028, Floki Inu is predicted to reach a maximum price of $0.000708. FLOKI price can reach a maximum level of $0.000381 and an average trading price of $0.0032 in 2031. Floki Inu is a meme coin driven by its community, the Floki Vikings. Inspired by Shiba Inu, Floki Inu aims to democratize power in the crypto space, pivoting the crypto market away from traditional financial entities. The Floki project ecosystem is diverse. It includes Valhalla, a blockchain combat game that rewards players with Floki tokens, and Floki Places, a store for merchandise and NFTs where purchases can be made using Floki tokens. Additionally, Floki University provides educational resources on the cryptocurrency market and blockchain technology. The recent launch (June 30, 2025) of the Valhalla mainnet of opBNB, coupled with DeFi partnerships like Chainlink, collectively enhances Floki Inu’s value and future potential by driving demand and expanding its use.

Indicators favour sellers, confirming the possibility of a further downtrend for FLOKI. FLOKI on the daily timeframe: Floki Inu sees persistent downtrend with weakening momentum FLOKI’s 1-day chart for August 19 reveals the price has been trapped in a prolonged downward trend, consistently making lower highs and lower lows. The Bollinger Bands are contracting, with the token now trading near the lower band at $0.00009714, indicating oversold conditions that haven’t yet attracted meaningful buying interest. FLOKIUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD’s deep negative territory is most concerning, with the histogram showing red bars that confirm selling momentum remains intact despite the token’s already depressed levels. Volume patterns show sporadic spikes to 21.93M but lack consistency, indicating that neither bulls nor bears show sustained conviction at current levels. FLOKI on the 4-hour timeframe: Short-term indicator reveals consolidation near critical support The 4-hour chart suggests FLOKI has found some stability around the $0.000102 level, forming a horizontal support zone that has been tested multiple times over recent sessions. FLOKIUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The 21-day SMA at $0.00010487 acts as immediate resistance, creating a narrow trading corridor. The Balance of Power shows sellers maintaining a slight edge. Likewise, the on-balance volume reflects the gradual erosion of buying interest.

Any recovery attempt must first overcome the 21-day SMA resistance at $0.000105 before challenging the more significant $0.00011 level. Is Floki Inu a good investment? FLOKI INU could be a big win or a big loss. It’s backed by a strong Floki community and consistent ecosystem developments, which can drive short-and long-term gains. But it’s risky, with price swings and unclear long-term value. Only invest if you’re comfortable with the risk. Will FLOKI reach $0.001? Expert analysis suggests that the $0.001 price point is achievable, provided utility grows and investor interest increases enough to drive FLOKI up ~9x its current market cap. Will Floki reach $0.01? FLOKI would need a $100 billion market cap to hit $0.01, over 100x its current value. Only the top six cryptos have surpassed this level, making it a major challenge without massive growth in adoption and demand. While possible, it’s unlikely in the short term. Does FLOKI have a good long-term future? According to expert analysis, FLOKI has a promising long-term future with consistent growth potential. The coin could reach up to $0.002 within the decade.

50316753,https://square.htx.com/?p=45676,1755575486,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/100/default.png,HTX Ventures Report: Are Tokenized Stocks A Treat or A Trap? A Complete Guide,https://square.htx.com/htx-ventures-report-are-tokenized-stocks-a-treat-or-a-trap-a-complete-guide/,"Foreword Singapore, 15 August, 2025 – Tokenized stocks are rapidly becoming the newest focal point where crypto meets traditional finance. With platforms such as Kraken and Robinhood stepping in, the market is moving to bring U.S. equities, ETFs, and other real-world assets (RWAs) on-chain, aiming to create a 24/7 global capital market powered by blockchain.This surge is fueled by the combined forces of stablecoin adoption, the rise of the global “shadow dollar” system, and the broader wave of real-world asset tokenization. The core logic is straightforward: stablecoins have already built a global shadow dollar network, and tokenized stocks are its natural extension, enabling non-U.S. users to access “shadow Wall Street” directly with USDT, bypassing account openings, remittance barriers, and cross-border settlements. This model not only opens new liquidity channels but also brings regulatory and compliance challenges into sharper focus. Meanwhile, the reverse pathway is also taking shape, with on-chain assets entering traditional markets through compliant restructuring. In a notable move, a Nasdaq-listed company recently rebranded as Tron Inc., integrating its public chain ecosystem and TRX token into its core strategy, a clear sign that the fusion of crypto assets and mainstream finance is no longer just theoretical but is materializing within formal regulatory frameworks. Golden opportunity or hidden trap? The answer depends on whether the loop can be closed: Can real-stock backing and transparent custody be guaranteed? Can liquidity and market-making be sustained long term? Can regional compliance keep pace with innovation? HTX Ventures will break down the business model, market players, regulatory landscape, typical risks, and future evolution in this report, helping you determine whether tokenized stocks are the golden gateway to RWAs or merely a grayscale trap in the capital markets. I. Why Are Crypto Investors Interested in Stocks? Since blockchain’s inception, almost every asset that can be tokenized has either already been or is in the process of being brought on-chain. From the earliest stablecoins to traditional financial assets such as real estate, bonds, and funds, and now the increasingly popular tokenized stocks, every innovation milestone has sought to break down the hurdles and barriers in traditional finance through blockchain. At its core, tokenized stocks are about converting stock assets in the traditional financial market into digital tokens on the blockchain. In this way, 24/7 global trading, fractional share purchases, and more efficient cross-border transactions could become a reality. The reason why this model has drawn much attention is that it directly addresses long-standing pain points faced by retail investors globally, especially those from emerging markets, such as the difficulty in opening accounts, remittance hurdles, and mismatched trading hours. However, tokenized stocks are not a new concept. They first appeared briefly in 2020, when exchanges like FTX and Binance all tried to launch such products but ultimately failed under intense regulatory pressure. II. Lessons from Early Attempts at Tokenized Stocks: FTX and Binance In 2020, FTX was one of the first exchanges to explore tokenized stocks. It partnered with the German securities firm CM-Equity to purchase real shares for custody and then issued tokenized versions of those stocks as ERC-20 tokens, representing companies such as Tesla, Apple, and Coinbase. These tokenized stocks were then sold to global users on its platform. FTX’s initial rollout was impressive and attracted many retail investors from emerging markets. But this model quickly caught the attention of securities regulators in Europe and the U.S. Germany’s BaFin and the U.S. SEC both issued stern warnings that such offerings qualified as public sales of securities, which mandated them to comply with securities regulations and obtain relevant licenses. Unable to meet these compliance requirements, FTX was forced to swiftly delist its tokenized stock products. In 2021, Binance introduced a similar product and used almost the same model to trade tokenized stocks of Tesla, Coinbase, and Apple. However, Binance’s effort was also short-lived and was shut down soon afterward under pressure from regulators across multiple countries. The setbacks faced by FTX and Binance sent a clear signal: the primary challenge facing tokenized stocks is not technology but compliance and regulation. III. Why Are Tokenized Stocks Back in the Spotlight? Despite having previously faced strong regulatory pushback, tokenized stocks made a comeback in 2024–2025, once again becoming the center of market attention. There are four primary reasons behind this: Policy and Political Factors: In 2024, Donald Trump openly endorsed crypto development, fueling market expectations about a more lenient regulatory climate. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce also expressed interest in a regulatory sandbox environment, suggesting a gray zone in policy interpretation. Entry of Traditional Financial Institutions: Traditional giants like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton have begun tokenizing funds, bonds, and other assets through blockchain. Their participation serves as an example, encouraging other traditional players to test the waters. Mature Technical Conditions: Unlike in 2020, rapid advancements in blockchain technologies like Solana, Base, and Arbitrum have slashed on-chain transaction costs, improved speed, and made liquidity easier to achieve. Persistently Strong Demand from Retail Users: Retail investors in regions such as Southeast Asia, South Asia, and the Middle East still have a strong appetite for U.S. stocks. These users hold substantial amounts of USDT but are locked out of traditional U.S. stock markets. Tokenized stocks directly fill this gap. IV. Why Are Tokenized Stocks Closely Tied to the Shadow Dollar System and the Stablecoin Hype? As a “second-layer evolution” of on-chain dollars via stablecoins , tokenized stocks directly convert retail users’ shadow dollars into shadow U.S. stocks, transforming RWAs from “assets in static custody” into “composable dynamic assets”. The hotter stablecoins get, the more room this model has to grow, but at the same time, regulators’ concern over the shadow dollar will rise accordingly. Stablecoins Are Essentially the Global “Gray Channel” of the Shadow Dollar System ● Dollar-pegged stablecoins (USDT and USDC) are no longer just “crypto payment tools”; they now function as “dollar proxies” that bypass traditional cross-border clearing networks. ● In many emerging markets, stablecoins act as local users’ shadow claims on the dollar. In countries like the Philippines, Pakistan, Argentina, and Vietnam, users may not hold local currencies, but with stablecoins, they effectively hold “dollars”. ● Therefore, from a retail investor’s perspective, holding USDT is almost equivalent to having dollar deposits, only more flexible . Users can move in and out of the crypto market at any time and even swap directly into tokenized stocks. ● As soon as tokenized stocks entered the picture, they naturally became a new use case for stablecoins : USDT and USDC could directly represent the on-chain shadow prices of Apple and Tesla, eliminating the need to convert to fiat currency or open an account with a U.S. broker. The Hotter Stablecoins Get, the More Room RWAs Have to Grow ● With a circulation of over $115 billion at one point in 2024, USDT has become the world’s largest “dollar alternative” , circulating much faster than traditional dollar wire transfers. ● With tremendously liquid stablecoins, on-chain RWAs (bonds, funds, real estate, and stocks) naturally need new “reservoirs” ; otherwise, USDT would remain locked in CEXs for futures trading, disconnected from real-world assets. ● Tokenized stocks are one of the most accessible and liquid RWAs in the world. Retail users are already familiar with the underlying assets, and market makers can price them based on actual secondary-market quotes, making them far easier to trade than real estate, art, or accounts receivable. Shadow Dollar System + Tokenized Stocks Turn U.S. Stocks Into Second-Layer Dollar Assets On-Chain ● From a regulatory standpoint, the pairing of tokenized stocks and stablecoins effectively creates a “shadow U.S. capital market”: ○ Stablecoins act as a shadow substitute for the dollar; ○ Tokenized stocks turn the equity returns of U.S. companies into shadow assets; ○ Together, they allow non-U.S. residents to trade “shadow U.S. stocks” with “shadow dollars” 24/7. ● This combination circumvents the U.S. brokerage system, the SWIFT network, and even the U.S.’s direct tax reporting framework (in theory). ● That’s why regulators are highly sensitive to it. What they’re keeping an eye on isn’t just the mechanics of the tokens, but the “spillover of dollar influence “. This Explains Why Kraken, Bybit, Robinhood, and Backed Dare to Make a Comeback in 2024–2025 ● Stablecoins have proven themselves worldwide with fast transactions and convenient cross‑border payments, while on‑chain RWAs now enjoy an endorsement from prominent companies such as BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. ● Platforms like Kraken and Bybit see this “shadow dollar” system as their chance to bring retail users in from the gray zone. ● Robinhood’s pilot launch of tokenized stocks in the EU reflects its confidence in USDT-driven traffic in non-U.S. markets , where it can tap into user groups it previously couldn’t reach through on‑chain notes. V. The Three Main Models of Tokenized Stocks Although “tokenized stocks” sounds simple, it follows more than one path in actual implementation. Depending on whether actual stocks are held in custody and how the tokens are issued and traded on-chain, there are three mainstream approaches in the market: The first is Real Stocks in Custody + On-Chain Token Issuance , the second is the Contract for Difference (CFD) model , and the third is pure DeFi synthetic assets . The three models have respective pros and cons, and the regulatory pressure they are facing, their liquidity design, and user-fit scenarios are also notably different. Understanding these differences is key to making sense of the entire tokenized stock sector. Model 1 | Real Stocks in Custody + On-Chain Token Issuance This is the mainstream approach currently adopted by Kraken and Bybit, and it is the most robust approach from a compliance standpoint. How It Works ● Licensed issuers or brokers (such as Backed Finance or Dinari) purchase real stocks (e.g., Apple or Tesla) from the traditional secondary market. ● These stock assets are then held in custody by regulated custodians (such as BitGo or Anchorage), ensuring that all holdings are authentic and verifiable. ● Based on the shares held in custody, issuers mint corresponding tokens on-chain at a 1:1 ratio. For example, 1 Apple share = 1 AAPLx (or bAAPL), which are deployable on networks like Solana or Base. ● Users can purchase these tokens on platforms like Bybit and Kraken using USDT, thereby indirectly gaining the on-chain assets pegged to real stocks. Key Features This seemingly ideal model actually comes with the following limitations: ● Though pegged to real stocks, most tokens do not grant voting rights or dividends. Platforms like Robinhood and Kraken clearly state on their websites: “This is not shareholder rights.” ● If users wish to redeem tokens for actual stocks, they typically must complete rigorous KYC verification, follow the custodian’s redemption process, and possibly pay extra fees. Some issuers even disallow retail users from redeeming fractional shares. ● Therefore, the vast majority of users purchase these tokens purely to capitalize on stock price fluctuations, and very few actually exercise shareholder rights. Why Are Kraken and Bybit Still Doubling Down on This Model? ● Compliance Buffer : Since the tokens are backed by real stocks held in transparent custody, it is possible to shift most of the responsibility to issuers (e.g., Backed) when under regulatory pressure. ● DeFi Composability : Tokens are transferable on-chain and composable across chains. For example, Kraken’s AAPLx can be sent to a Solana wallet and used for liquidity provision on Jupiter or for yield farming on Kamino. ● Stronger Appeal to Retail Users : Compared to CFDs or synthetic assets, tokenized stocks backed by real stocks sound more authentic, which helps lower users’ psychological barriers and makes market education easier. Special Case | Robinhood’s Full-Chain Integration Approach Robinhood takes an even bolder path. With its U.S. broker license, it is already capable of handling real stock trading and custody in-house. The company is currently developing Robinhood Chain to link stock accounts directly on-chain. It aims to integrate in-house custody, on-chain issuance, and matching, while connecting to Bitstamp for global liquidity. This model is essentially a “brokerage version of Binance Chain”, where Robinhood controls the entire process from note issuance and market-making to data flow, keeping all profits, users, and traffic within its own ecosystem. However, it is worth noting that such a highly closed compliance framework and technical barriers make this model not easily replicable by ordinary exchanges or wallet providers in the short term. The investment required to build this ecosystem is far beyond the reach of smaller players. Model 2 | CFDs: A Simple Wrapper with a Classic Approach Compared with real stocks in custody, CFDs (Contracts for Difference) may seem the simplest but are one of the most widely adopted approaches by exchanges today. How It Works ● Typical players like Bybit CFD and PrimeXBT employ similar structures. ● Users select products like “Apple CFD” via MT5, MT4, or Bybit’s built‑in CFD page and open positions based on expected price movements. ● The counterparty to each trade is the platform itself or an external liquidity provider (LP), without needing to hold the underlying stock or keep physical items in custody. ● Spreads, slippage, and leverage parameters are set entirely by the platform. Trades are essentially bets on prices against the platform or its LPs, without stock delivery or shareholder registration. Why Are CFDs So Popular? ● Fast Deployment : Upon connection to mature LPs and real-time stock data, trading starts once orders are listed. ● Lower Compliance Pressure : In most jurisdictions, CFDs are classified as derivatives. As long as there is no physical stock delivery, they typically fall outside the strictest securities regulations. ● High User Acceptance : Most crypto traders are already familiar with BTC and ETH futures and can switch to U.S. stock futures without extra learning, as the operational logic is identical. Bybit’s Dual-Track Strategy Bybit’s moves in recent months provide a typical example: ● On the one hand, it has partnered with Backed to introduce xStocks (like AAPLx and TSLAx), catering to users who prefer “real-stock backing” and competing directly with platforms like Kraken and Robinhood. ● On the other hand, Bybit has continued to offer its traditional CFD products to meet demand from speculative traders seeking high leverage and around-the-clock opportunities to profit from price swings. This dual-track hybrid model enables Bybit to serve both conservative users who prefer the assurance of real stock-backed assets and high-frequency speculators pursuing leveraged volatility within a single trading system, thus maximizing both liquidity sources and user base. Risks: What Users Should Watch Out For While CFDs are simple and accessible, the risks associated with them must not be overlooked: ● No Shareholder Rights : CFDs grant no voting or dividend rights and are not tied to any shareholder register. ● Counterparty Is the Platform or LPs : User profits mean losses for the platform or LP. If trades are too precise, some platforms may manage their risk through slippage or forced liquidation mechanisms, creating the possibility of negative equity and widened slippage. ● Essentially a Regulated Betting Market: Therefore, CFDs are better suited for short-term trading on price fluctuations and do not share the long-term value characteristics of stocks. Model 3 | Pure On-Chain DeFi Synthetic Assets Compared with the first two models, pure on-chain DeFi synthetic assets represent the most fundamental approach to decentralization. Representative projects include early-stage Mirror Protocol and the currently active Synthetix. How It Works ● Users stake stablecoins (such as UST or sUSD) in smart contracts as collateral to mint synthetic assets. ● The protocol calls oracles to fetch real-time stock prices of underlying assets. For example, Apple stock is traded at $180. ● Based on oracle data, smart contracts automatically mint synthetic tokens for corresponding stocks such as “mAAPL” or “sTSLA”. These tokens only track stock prices and do not represent actual stock ownership. ● Users can use tokens for liquidity provision (LP) through on-chain DEXs (such as Terraswap, Uniswap, Curve), trade freely, or build indices or apply leverage. Key Advantages ● Fully On-Chain : These assets are not reliant on centralized matching or custody, with issuance, circulation, and burns all executed by smart contracts. ● Flexible Composition : These assets can be combined with other modules in the DeFi ecosystem to derive collateralized loans, options, structured products, and more. Limitations and Risks ● No Real-Stock Backing : Synthetic assets depend entirely on oracle-fed prices and have no backing from actual stock ownership. ● High Systemic Risk : If an oracle is compromised or malfunctions, the price peg will fail, and the contract may lose its repayment capacity. ● Liquidity Depletion Risk : Unlike centralized market making, the market depth of on-chain LP hinges on continuous order placement and profit distribution from users. Without sustained incentives, liquidity can drop rapidly. Mirror Protocol’s failure is a classic example: after the collapse of the Terra ecosystem and UST’s depeg, all synthetic stocks on Mirror, like mAAPL and mTSLA, became worthless. Synthetix is still running, with some sAAPL and sTSLA circulating on Optimism and its main protocol as collateral or in synthetic debt pools. However, both its user base and TVL have shrunk dramatically from their peak. Purely DeFi-based tokenized stocks are far less popular than stablecoins and leveraged ETH products. Three Models of Tokenized Stocks Three Models of Tokenized Stocks VI. Players Breakdown: Who Are Involved in this Sector The current wave of tokenized stocks has already formed a clear supply chain, linking upstream issuance, custody, platform liquidity, and end-user distribution . Backed Finance: The Core Issuer Behind the Scenes ● Headquartered in Switzerland, Backed is one of the leading issuers of tokenized stocks. It is purchasing real stocks through traditional brokers and uses Chainlink’s Proof of Reserve (PoR) to disclose custodial details on-chain in real time. ● Its major clients include Kraken, Bybit, and Ondo. Backed’s tokenized stocks are considered “compliant spot assets eligible for listing” that CEXs can list quickly for retail traders. ● The core logic is that issuers bear the responsibility for securities compliance and custody, while CEXs handle only frontend KYC/AML to minimize direct exposure to securities issuance liabilities. Ondo & Securitize: Alliance-Oriented Player and Traditional Digital Securities Service Provider ● Ondo spearheaded the “Global Stocks Alliance”, partnering with Solana Foundation, BitGo, Fireblocks, Jupiter, and others to develop standards for cross-chain operations, custody, and liquidity. ● Securitize is an early player in digital securities, primarily serving traditional enterprises by offering equity tokenization and connecting them with qualified investors. Positioned toward the B2B market, it does not directly target retail users. Dinari: Tackling U.S. Compliance Head-On ● Based in the U.S., Dinari aims to deliver truly compliant tokenized stocks, “dShares”, by obtaining compliant licenses such as Reg D and Reg CF and securing ATS (Alternative Trading System) qualification. ● Unlike Backed, Dinari hopes to offer users optional shareholder privileges (e.g., dividends) in the future. However, the extremely high cost of U.S. compliance poses major challenges, requiring sustained investment in broker licenses, custodial infrastructure, and legal counsel. ● Dinari currently follows a B2B model, partnering with wallets or exchanges to introduce tokenized stocks as white-label products. Kraken: A Leading Compliant CEX ● Kraken has long positioned itself as a compliance-focused CEX, supported by European and U.S. users’ trust in licenses and compliance. ● Its xStocks module works closely with Backed: Backed is responsible for the custody of real stocks, while Kraken provides matching, listing, wallets, and API integration. Its PoR is publicly verifiable, and the tokens can be transferred on-chain to networks like Solana for secondary liquidity through LPs and DEXs. ● Kraken pays special attention to compliance boundaries, implementing IP blocking and timezone-based KYC restrictions for U.S. users to stay clear of SEC red lines. Bybit: Dual-Track Hybrid Strategy Balancing Spot and Derivatives ● The biggest difference between Bybit and Kraken lies in the fact that Bybit operates two parallel product lines: tokenized real stocks and CFDs (Contracts for Difference). ● CFDs are offered by Bybit through integrations with external liquidity providers (such as IS Prime and Finalto) and the MT5 system, catering to the needs of high-frequency speculative traders and generating revenue from spreads and fees. ● For tokenized real stocks, Bybit partners with Backed to list xStocks (like AAPLx and TSLAx), serving users who prefer “real-stock backing”. Both user groups can be converted simultaneously on the platform. Robinhood: Integrated Chain of Proprietary Brokerage ● Robinhood holds a U.S. broker-dealer license, which allows it to offer real stock trading and custody. ● It has developed the Robinhood Chain, moving stock accounts on-chain, supported by its proprietary wallet and trading/matching systems. Pilot programs have been launched in the EU (Robinhood Europe), where over 200 stocks and ETFs are packaged into token products for EU users to trade, thus bypassing U.S. regulation. ● Bitstamp provides a liquidity bridge, allowing users to later use the tokens as collateral or incorporate them into structured products in DeFi scenarios. ● This “internal broker chain” approach enables Robinhood to close the loop across issuance, custody, matching, and liquidity, dramatically improving user retention and data control. However, it requires strong compliance credentials and substantial capital, making it challenging for smaller players to replicate in the short term. Republic: Specializing in Rare Non-Listed Equity ● Unlike other projects that target publicly listed stocks, Republic focuses on tokenizing rare private equity in non-listed companies (such as SpaceX and OpenAI). It typically adopts an SPV (Special Purpose Vehicle) note model, allowing retail investors to invest indirectly in equities that were previously out of reach. ● The risk lies in potential authorization issues for certain private equity tokens. For instance, OpenAI has publicly stated that related products launched by Robinhood Europe were unauthorized, and the SEC has launched an investigation. VII. Global Regulatory Overview U.S.: Securities Law as a Hard Constraint ● Core Principle : Tokenized stocks ≠ non-securities. As long as stocks are mirrored into tokens, and related products and services are offered to U.S. users, SEC securities regulations are automatically triggered. ● Compliance Requirements : Issuing and selling tokenized stocks requires a broker-dealer license, ATS (Alternative Trading System) license, and a custody and information disclosure architecture in line with securities law. Meanwhile, compliance counsel is also required to review the issuance documentation. ● Regulatory Stance: The SEC has always made its stance clear – “Tokenization doesn’t change the nature of the underlying asset.” ● Lessons Learned : FTX and Binance attempted tokenized stock offerings in 2020–2021, but they lacked proper compliance credentials. Under pressure from the SEC, FINRA, and BaFin, they were ultimately forced to delist the products. EU: Dual Oversight under MiFID II and MiCA ● MiFID II : Any product that involves securities sales and targets retail or institutional investors must strictly comply with the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive. It is prohibited to label something a “token” to evade existing obligations under securities law. ● MiCA : MiCA primarily governs crypto assets and stablecoins, but tokenized stocks with real equity backing may also fall under its regulatory framework. ● Regional Practice : Robinhood Europe has carried out pilot programs in the EU, offering tokenized stock products through an SPV structure. Once a token is deemed to represent an actual security, additional exemptions should be applied for or information should be fully disclosed as per local requirements. Asia and the Middle East: Active Gray-Zone Pilots ● Regulators, including Singapore’s MAS, Switzerland’s FINMA, and the UAE’s ADGM/DFSA, have created regulatory sandboxes for RWAs (real-world assets), allowing small-scale pilot tokenization programs, provided they mainly target non-U.S. clients and qualified regional investors. ● Hong Kong remains cautious on security tokenization. Most RWA activity there centers on bonds, funds, and structured notes, with large-scale tokenized stock operations yet to be approved. VIII. Real-World Use Cases | How Global Retail and Institutions Are Participating The adoption of tokenized stocks extends beyond retail investors. From individual traders to high-frequency speculators, from small and medium-sized CEXs and regional wallets to traditional brokers and DeFi protocols, everyone can find their own entry points and viable paths in this sector. 1. Ordinary Retail Investors ● The most straightforward use case is to buy small amounts of xStocks, using USDT to access tokenized stocks of companies like Apple and Tesla and track their price fluctuations. ● The primary demand is to address the pain point of users who don’t have U.S. brokerage accounts but want a low-barrier way to get started. ● Key Understanding : It is important to clarify that holding tokens does not confer shareholder rights such as dividends or voting rights. 2. High-Frequency Speculators ● This group focuses on tokenized stocks in order to exploit short-term price spreads and volatility arbitrage. ● CFDs are the most suitable, as they support leverage, flexible hedging, and T+0 position closing. ● Key Understanding : Traders must grasp slippage, leverage risk, and counterparty trading mechanisms where positions are taken against them to avoid forced liquidation or negative equity. 3. Small and Medium-Sized Exchanges/Regional CEXs ● Without full broker-dealer licenses, these platforms can adopt a hybrid model combining CFDs and tokenized partnerships. ● They provide spot and CFD matching at the frontend and partner with issuers like Backed and Dinari at the backend to onboard real note-backed tokens, capturing gray-zone traffic and earning fee revenue. ● Key Understanding : It is essential to define reasonable service regions to steer clear of strictly regulated markets like the U.S. 4. Traditional Brokers ● Brokers with mature legal and financial capabilities favor a model combining self-built chains and proprietary licenses. ● Robinhood and Bitstamp are already exploring this path in European and U.S. markets: On-chain accounts and in-house custody allow them to profit from both matching and custody. ● Key Understanding : Mature licensing systems, compliant custody, and multi-jurisdictional legal support are needed. 5. Wallets/Agents ● In emerging markets, some wallets or OTC teams prefer to use white-label tokenized products and list notes from issuers like Kraken or Backed into their own apps or mini-programs to capture traffic and earn matching commissions. ● This model works especially well in regions like Pakistan or the Philippines where retail investors face high barriers to opening accounts and gray-market demand is high. ● Key Understanding : It is critical to find credible issuers and ensure compliance to mitigate local regulatory risk. 6. DeFi Protocols ● Tokenized stock assets can be combined with on-chain bonds or stablecoins to serve as essential building blocks for composite derivatives within the DeFi ecosystem. ● Common use cases include providing bilateral liquidity in LP pools or serving as collateral and leverage within lending protocols like Aave and Compound. ● Key Understanding : The security of oracles and clearing mechanisms must be ensured to avoid oracle attacks or price failures that hit projects like Mirror. How Different Investors Participate in Tokenized Stocks IX Risk Points | Truths and Common Pitfalls While tokenized stocks may seem to offer global users a convenient channel to trade U.S. stocks, the underlying risks and operational hurdles are often underestimated. Below are the five key risks to watch out for: Risk 1 | Most Tokens Do Not Grant Shareholder Rights Platforms such as Robinhood, Backed, and Kraken clearly state in their official FAQs: “This token does not represent actual shareholder rights.” In other words, users only hold on-chain instruments pegged to stock prices and are not shareholders in the traditional sense. ● Users cannot automatically access companies’ annual reports, participate in AGMs (Annual General Meetings), or vote as shareholders; ● Dividends are generally excluded unless the issuer has explicitly designed a profit-sharing mechanism, which is extremely rare in reality. Therefore, for most users, what they hold is merely a price proxy , rather than an actual shareholder stake. Risk 2 | Redeeming Real Stocks Is Far More Complicated Than It Seems Although most tokenized note products theoretically support 1:1 redemption, the barriers are high in practice: ● There is usually a minimum redemption threshold (e.g., at least 1 share, with some products requiring 100 shares or more); ● Cooling-off periods are often imposed, ranging from 30 to 90 days; ● Users must redo full KYC, submitting documents like proof of address; ● Most redemptions incur additional fees, typically ranging from 0.5% to 2% of the face value. As a result, the vast majority of retail users rarely opt for redemption in practice. Risk 3 | Insufficient Liquidity Can Lead to “Empty Pools” Although tokenized stocks are traded through on-chain liquidity pools or CEXs, actual order book depth is often limited: ● For example, the main LP pools of Backed’s AAPL and TSLA on Solana generally hold only a few million dollars; ● Day-to-day market-making is largely sustained by orders from a small number of liquidity providers such as Kraken or Bitstamp; ● Once mainstream market makers pull out or an exchange delists a token, users may have to offload their holdings through OTC or other non-mainstream channels, significantly heightening liquidity risk. Risk 4 | Oracle Failures Pose Critical Hidden Threat to On-Chain Synthetic Assets Pure DeFi synthetic assets rely on oracles like Chainlink and Pyth to feed real-time stock prices. In cases of false pricing attacks, API errors, or oracle manipulations, the synthetic tokens minted by smart contracts will no longer be accurate: ● A classic example is the Mirror Protocol in the Terra ecosystem: After UST depegged and LUNA collapsed, oracle failures caused many synthetic assets like mAAPL and mTSLA to plunge to zero. Risk 5 | Cross-Border Compliance and Regulatory Crackdowns Can Happen Anytime Tokenized stock projects can trigger oversight from regulators such as the SEC and FINRA as soon as they target U.S. residents or involve cross‑border securities sales: ● Robinhood Europe launched tokenized shares of OpenAI and SpaceX without official authorization. Regarding this, OpenAI has publicly denied issuing such shares, and a regulatory investigation has been triggered. ● Cases like Binance and FTX offer valuable lessons. The former was forced to delist, while the latter ultimately faced bankruptcy liquidation due to compliance failures. X. Future Outlook | Three Potential Evolution Paths As part of RWAs, tokenized stocks are just getting started. Over the next three years, it may evolve along three primary paths: Scenario A | Brokers Go On-Chain with Proprietary Closed Loops Robinhood is highly likely to double down on its all-in strategy: building its own blockchain, securing compliance licenses, managing custody of real stocks in-house, issuing tokens on-chain, and integrating matching and settlement into a proprietary system. If the SEC allows for greater flexibility in compliance pathways, Robinhood could achieve a fully integrated “broker + wallet + blockchain” stack. If successful, this path would resemble a “compliant Binance Smart Chain”, with the key distinction that its underlying assets would be real stocks and ETFs rather than crypto-native tokens. Scenario B | Breakthroughs First Made in Regional Gray Markets Regions such as Abu Dhabi, Singapore, and Switzerland have already incorporated RWAs into their official innovation pilots, opening the door for early experimentation with the implementation models of tokenized stocks and other gray-zone assets. In the future, we may see more region-specific models: ● Americas and the EU will primarily rely on local licensing systems and domestic brokers; ● Emerging markets in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Africa are poised to become major distribution hubs for tokenized stocks operating in regulatory gray zones worldwide. Kraken, Bybit, Ondo, and other platforms are expected to intensify their presence in these regulatory gray zones, focusing on non-U.S. user traffic and the opportunities created by licensing flexibility. Scenario C | DeFi Composition and Modular Pathways If the DeFi space continues to gain momentum in the new cycle, tokenized stocks may evolve into composable financial Lego blocks, becoming an integral part of on-chain RWA composition strategies. ● For example, tokenized bonds (e.g., Ondo T-bills), tokenized stocks (e.g., Backed AAPLx), and stablecoins (e.g., USDC) can be bundled into structured on-chain notes or index products. ● Tokenized stocks can also be added to liquidity pools (LPs) for bilateral market-making, providing greater depth for on-chain funds. ● Users can also use these assets as collateral in lending protocols such as Aave and Compound to enable higher leverage, creating more complex, yield-generating strategies within the DeFi ecosystem. Once this DeFi composition pipeline is fully operational, on-chain RWAs will no longer be simply about note issuance or unidirectional transfers; they will form a closed-loop liquidity system that is collateralizable, composable, and redistributable. Scenario D | Non-Compliant Perpetual Futures and Gray-Zone Matching Apart from mainstream compliance pathways and on-chain DeFi composition, a gray-zone branch remains active in the market and should not be overlooked: If regulatory pressure fails to create globally consistent constraints, we may see the rise of small and medium-sized trading platforms offering non-compliant perpetual stock futures . ● These platforms may operate as CEXs or depend on anonymous on-chain derivatives protocols, directly tapping retail capital flows and offering matching services for perpetual stock futures with USDT. ● Perpetual futures function much like traditional CFDs but can be designed with higher leverage, automatic renewal, and no requirement for holding real stocks or custodial assets. They are purely instruments for price speculation. ● Some projects may encapsulate their frontends on-chain (e.g., cross-chain DEXs or anonymous derivatives pools), leveraging on-chain liquidity and anonymous accounts to attract risk-seeking users while minimizing the cost of compliance traceability. Once the market’s demand for short-term leverage on tokenized stocks continues to rise, these non-compliant matching and perpetuals may quickly gain traction in regional markets, serving as a gray-zone workaround that circumvents regulation and satisfies the needs of high-frequency speculators. Nonetheless, this branch is also extremely risky: Any involvement of cross-border fund flows or U.S. users may trigger compliance actions from regulators such as the SEC, CFTC, or other jurisdictional bodies at any time. Users then face potential losses from sudden liquidity crunches, platform shutdowns, or extreme slippage. XI. Reverse Integration: When On-Chain Assets Begin Entering the Stock Market If tokenized stocks represent the migration of traditional financial assets onto the blockchain, something that happened recently may mark the beginning of a reverse trend: On-chain assets are now attempting to penetrate the traditional financial system , seeking to establish their credibility in mainstream capital markets through more compliant and structured means. On July 25, a Nasdaq-listed company formerly known as SRM Entertainment officially rebranded as Tron Inc. and adopted a new ticker symbol, TRON. The company announced the divestment of its toy business and restructured its core assets around a TRX treasury strategy to support the development of the TRON DAO ecosystem, using TRX, the native token of the TRON blockchain, as its primary strategic reserve asset. It currently holds more than 365 million TRX, which are staked and managed through on-chain protocols such as JustLend to generate returns. The day the news broke, Tron Inc.’s stock price surged by more than 55% , becoming the talk of the market. This not only represents a high-profile comeback of a crypto firm through a backdoor listing but also signals that on-chain native assets are exploring new avenues for building compliant financial structures. It is worth noting that this is not the first time a publicly listed traditional company has disclosed its crypto holdings. Back in 2020, MicroStrategy became the exemplar of “crypto-holding listed company” for its ongoing BTC purchases, which were fully reflected in its financial reports. Companies like Tesla, Block, and Coinbase have also reported holdings of BTC, ETH, or stablecoins in their financial reports. What sets Tron Inc. apart from these companies is that: ● It is among the few listed companies whose core assets are public-chain tokens (TRX), with a corporate strategy centered on building an on-chain ecosystem. ● The project team does not hold direct equity but exerts “shadow control” through DAO governance and advisory structures, seeking to bridge on-chain governance with traditional equity structures under a compliant framework. ● Its asset operations rely more heavily on on-chain protocols (e.g., JustLend), and its yield mechanisms are more natively Web3. This type of operation is no longer mere capital maneuvering but an active reshaping of the narrative: transforming tokenized assets into financial units that are recognizable, measurable, and compliantly tradable in traditional financial structures. Following stablecoins and crypto treasuries, this may become the next proving ground for connecting public blockchain ecosystems with TradFi. Thus, we are now witnessing a “two-way embedding” between tokenized stocks and equitized on-chain assets: ● On the one hand, real-world assets like U.S. stocks and bonds are being brought on-chain, enriching the on-chain finance ecosystem and strengthening its ties to reality; ● On the other hand, native crypto assets are making their way into mainstream capital markets through compliant pathways, gaining additional liquidity and institutional backing. This trend is no longer just an idea on paper. Instead, it is gradually materializing through cases such as exchanges like Kraken and Bybit promoting the tokenization of real stocks, and Tron Inc. going public via a backdoor listing. Together, they sketch out an early blueprint of an “on-chain Wall Street”: a bridge between decentralized asset structures and traditional market architectures. Whether this ecosystem will eventually form a closed loop will depend on market-making capabilities, the regulatory climate, and the resilience of its institutional design. However, one thing is certain: the line between tokens and stocks is being redrawn. XII. Conclusion | Treat or Trap? It All Comes Down to the Closed Loop and Structural Design From the tokenization of real stocks driven by Kraken, Bybit, and Robinhood, to the compliant token issuance roles undertaken by Backed, Dinari, and Ondo, and finally to the reverse entry of on-chain assets into traditional markets represented by Tron Inc., the real competitive edge in this round of asset restructuring has never been just about smart contracts or product design; it lies in whether a complete on-chain financial closed loop can be built and sustained. From a macro perspective, this model is a second-layer extension of the stablecoin system: Stablecoins have enabled global retail traders to bypass traditional bank settlement networks, while tokenized stocks now connect these shadow dollars to “shadow U.S. stocks”. Together, the two form a kind of on-chain “Gray Wall Street”, breaking apart the closed-off capital markets of the real world into a 24/7, modular, composable on-chain marketplace. For this model to truly take root, it requires a clear chain of accountability and strong compliance backing: Real equity backing is essential to preventing hollow arbitrage; transparency in custody and issuance is critical to maintaining user trust; sustained market-making and liquidity are needed to support on-chain trading depth; and regional licenses together with cross-border compliance mechanisms are required to mitigate constraints imposed by the SEC, the EU, and other regulators worldwide. Any slip in this process could render users’ notes worthless, turning them into stranded assets that grant no rights and cannot be redeemed. For retail traders, tokenized stocks may be nothing more than a speculative channel for testing gray-zone pathways, while genuine shareholder status and long-term returns remain rooted in traditional brokerage systems. For small and medium-sized CEXs, wallets, OTC desks, and DeFi protocols, this may be the fastest way to activate dormant stablecoin liquidity in the wallets and rapidly plug into the RWA sector. Conversely, Tron Inc. has provided a radical yet pragmatic possibility: bringing crypto into traditional capital markets and establishing an institutional connection with stocks. Whether it’s a treat or a trap ultimately hinges on who can build a bidirectional, composable, and operational closed-loop structure. Those who successfully navigate this path may be the ones to lead the next wave of assets and liquidity. —————————————- About HTX Ventures HTX Ventures, the global investment division of HTX , integrates investment, incubation, and research to identify the best and brightest teams worldwide.

With hype building around the next big memecoin and the promise of Layer 2 scalability, many analysts are speculating that $LBRETT could be the next 100x altcoin. The project’s ongoing crypto presale and staking rewards have drawn significant investor interest, especially as traditional coins like SOL see sentiment shaken by the recent ETF delay. Could this be the moment when Ethereum Layer 2 innovation leaves legacy chains behind? Solana price prediction and the Layer Brett effect The Solana Price Prediction narrative has shifted as investors react to the ETF delay and growing competition from Layer 2 projects. SOL, often praised for its high throughput and ecosystem upgrades, now faces a fresh wave of competition as new Layer 2 crypto solutions like Layer Brett gain traction. While SOL has seen periods as a top gainer crypto and remains a favorite among DeFi coin enthusiasts, the emergence of Ethereum Layer 2 projects is causing some to reconsider their long-term positions. Many are watching to see if SOL can maintain its market cap lead or if it will cede ground to newer, faster altcoins offering low gas fee crypto transactions and dynamic staking crypto rewards. Recent market activity suggests that the focus is shifting toward platforms that blend meme culture with real blockchain utility. The rise of Layer Brett is a clear example, as its presale momentum and unique value propositions draw investor attention away from even established coins like SOL.

This latest transaction highlights a shrewd strategy that has yielded remarkable returns for the firm. The recent sale involved 5,000 ETH, valued at an impressive $21.56 million, undertaken specifically to secure profits. How Does Longling Capital Manage Its ETH Holdings? Over the past two years, Longling Capital has demonstrated a clear and consistent approach to managing its Ethereum assets. Their strategy involves calculated withdrawals and deposits, timed to maximize gains from market fluctuations. This long-term engagement with the ETH market has allowed them to accumulate significant wealth. Initially, the firm withdrew a staggering 123,405 ETH from Binance. This large sum, valued at approximately $290 million at the time, was acquired at an average price of $2,349 per ETH. Their disciplined approach involved holding these assets through various market cycles, waiting for opportune moments to optimize their positions. Unpacking Longling Capital’s Astounding Profit The recent Longling Capital sale is just one piece of a much larger, highly profitable puzzle. The firm has successfully re-deposited a substantial portion of its holdings back onto exchanges, demonstrating a clear profit-taking mechanism. This careful management has resulted in a truly impressive financial outcome. Longling Capital later deposited 70,800 ETH back onto exchanges. These deposits were made at a significantly higher average price of $3,502 per ETH , valuing them at $248 million. Based on these figures, the estimated profit secured by Longling Capital stands at an astounding $184 million . This figure underscores the success of their strategic trading. What Can We Learn from Longling Capital’s Strategy? The actions of firms like Longling Capital offer valuable insights into sophisticated crypto investment strategies. Their ability to consistently withdraw and deposit large sums, securing substantial profits, provides a case study for market participants. It emphasizes the importance of long-term vision combined with timely execution. This approach involves: Market Observation: Closely monitoring price trends and market sentiment to identify opportunities. Strategic Entry and Exit Points: Identifying optimal times to acquire assets at lower prices and sell them at higher valuations. Profit Realization: Actively taking profits rather than solely holding assets indefinitely, ensuring capital gains are secured. While the scale of Longling Capital’s operations is immense, the underlying principles can be adapted by individual investors. Understanding market cycles and having a clear profit-taking strategy are crucial elements for success in the volatile crypto space.

50317042,547523,1755576018,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50317042.jpeg,15-Week Crypto Inflow Streak Ends with a $223M Shock Withdrawal,https://bitcoinist.com/15-week-crypto-inflow-streak-ends-with-a-223m/,"The crypto asset investment market experienced its first weekly outflows in over three months, according to the latest data released by CoinShares, a leading European asset manager specializing in cryptocurrencies. The firm’s weekly report shows that digital asset investment products recorded net outflows of $223 million during the past week , halting a 15-week streak of positive inflows. CoinShares attributed the shift to changing investor sentiment in the second half of the week, particularly following key US macroeconomic events. James Butterfill, Head of Research at CoinShares, explained that the market started on a strong note with $883 million in inflows, but sentiment turned negative after a hawkish Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting and stronger-than-expected US economic data dampened risk appetite. “The reversal came swiftly, with over $1 billion in outflows recorded on Friday alone,” Butterfill noted in the report. Bitcoin Sees Largest Outflows Amid Market Reactions Bitcoin, which has historically been the most sensitive crypto asset to monetary policy changes, bore the brunt of last week’s negative flows. The asset saw $404 million in outflows, marking one of the largest weekly pullbacks in recent months. Despite this, year-to-date inflows remain strong , standing at $20 billion, signaling sustained long-term interest from institutional investors. CoinShares highlighted that the sudden shift could be partly due to profit-taking following a period of significant market inflows. Over the last 30 days alone, digital asset products attracted $12.2 billion, representing half of the total inflows for 2025 to date. The report suggested that after such a sharp accumulation phase, it is not uncommon for investors to lock in gains amid increased macroeconomic uncertainty . Altcoins Maintain Resilient Inflows Despite Market Pullback While Bitcoin experienced notable outflows, other leading altcoins continued to attract capital. Ethereum recorded $133 million in net inflows, marking its 15th consecutive week of positive investment flows, which is seen as a sign of growing confidence in its long-term adoption prospects. Other assets, including XRP ($31.2 million), Solana ($8.8 million), and SEI ($5.8 million), also posted positive inflows, suggesting that investor interest in diversified crypto exposure remains intact. Aave and Sui saw smaller but still positive inflows of $1.2 million and $0.8 million, respectively. Despite last week’s overall outflows, CoinShares maintains that broader sentiment toward digital assets remains constructive, with total assets under management for crypto investment products still well above last quarter’s levels. The report emphasized that digital asset products are likely to remain highly sensitive to macroeconomic policy developments, particularly US Federal Reserve decisions on interest rates. The report also highlighted that the combination of strong year-to-date inflows and occasional profit-taking is likely to persist as investors adjust positions based on shifting economic signals .

50317063,https://timestabloid.com/?p=79131,1755576035,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"7 Best Crypto Investments Right Now — XRP, SEI and MAGACOIN FINANCE Backed by Whales",https://timestabloid.com/7-best-crypto-investments-right-now-xrp-sei-and-magacoin/,"Crypto markets are still choppy, but that hasn’t stopped whales from moving. When big wallets shift billions, smaller investors usually pay attention — and the patterns right now are hard to miss. XRP is seeing some of the heaviest accumulation in months, SEI has clawed its way back into breakout territory, and MAGACOIN FINANCE has burst onto the scene with one of the fastest-selling presales of 2025. Alongside blue-chip names like Ethereum, Solana, Toncoin, and Avalanche, these tokens are shaping the shortlist of coins that traders say could lead the next bull run. XRP — Whales Absorb the Panic Despite August’s turbulence, XRP’s chart tells a different story behind the scenes. More than 440 million XRP changed hands into whale wallets during recent sell-offs — a sign of quiet confidence from the biggest players. The token currently hovers between $2.95 and $3.14, with analysts eyeing a rebound to the $4.00–$4.47 zone if market sentiment steadies. The thesis is simple: when whales lean in this heavily, they’re often preparing for a breakout. Ripple’s growing role in cross-border payments only strengthens that view. SEI — Quietly Building Momentum SEI isn’t the loudest name in the room, but it’s making noise in the right circles. The Layer-1 token has snapped out of a long downtrend, drawing smart money inflows and renewed optimism from traders. Due to this, market forecasts suggest gains of up to 160%, with targets around $0.90 in 2025. Undoubtedly, EI’s appeal lies in speed and scalability, the same qualities that once propelled Solana. For those who can stomach risk, SEI is emerging as one of the higher-upside plays outside the top 20 coins. MAGACOIN FINANCE — The Crypto Presale That Won’t Slow Down XRP and SEI might be showing strength, but MAGACOIN FINANCE has something neither of them does, which is a crypto presale that’s already rewriting expectations. Wallet activity is surging, allocations are selling out fast, and both retail and whale buyers are jumping in before listings. Analysts project as much as 35x upside, citing MAGACOIN’s viral branding and capped supply as the twin forces behind its rise. Notably, the project blends meme energy with DeFi-style tokenomics, positioning it as the most aggressive new entrant of 2025. It’s not for the faint of heart, but for those chasing asymmetric bets, MAGACOIN is quickly becoming the coin speculators don’t want to miss. Ethereum — Shrinking Supply, Growing Demand Ethereum continues to play its role as the bedrock of DeFi and stablecoin. With exchange balances at multi-year lows and institutional ETFs pulling in steady inflows, ETH is showing the slow, relentless accumulation pattern of a blue-chip asset. So, investors looking for stability with upside still treat the top crypto asset as a must-own. Solana — Proving It’s Not a Fad Solana has had its setbacks, but the network’s developer ecosystem hasn’t slowed. Gaming and NFTs remain strong points, and whale activity is beginning to reflect that optimism. Essentially, SOL still has a seat at the table for traders who want exposure to high-performance chains. Toncoin — The Social Network Play Few projects can tap into an existing user base the size of Telegram’s 800 million accounts. Toncoin does just that. By embedding its wallet directly into the app, TON has turned itself into a native payments and DeFi rail with instant distribution. That kind of reach makes it unique among altcoins. Avalanche — Betting on Infrastructure Avalanche’s subnet architecture keeps attracting builders, giving it a long-term edge as an infrastructure play. After retracing in previous cycles, AVAX now sits undervalued relative to its potential, making it a contrarian bet for investors who prefer the “picks and shovels” side of blockchain. The Bottom Line Each coin on this list offers something different: XRP has whale confidence, SEI is clawing back into form, and Ethereum and Solana bring scale and credibility. Toncoin and Avalanche cover real-world integration and infrastructure growth. But the wildcard is clear: MAGACOIN FINANCE is the new entry that’s turned heads this quarter. It combines an energetic crypto presale frenzy with whale momentum, giving it a unique position on the list of 2025’s best crypto bets. If XRP brings clarity and SEI brings speed, MAGACOIN FINANCE brings the early-stage energy that often sparks the biggest gains.

The token’s seven-day retracement likewise sits at 4.50%, and it is down about 35.5% year-to-date while trading outside the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap. At the time of reporting, SHIB’s market price was $0.00001261. Related Reading: After Monero Hit, Qubic Group Puts Dogecoin On Target List Shiba Inu Weekly Support Levels Hold Analyst MMB Trader has pointed to two weekly support lines at $0.000010 and $0.000007 that have repeatedly absorbed selling pressure. SHIB dropped to $0.00000714 in July 2022 after an 88% fall from its 2021 peak of $0.00008854, and buyers pushed it back up. The popular memecoin came back to that area in June and October 2023 and regained footing. This year, the token revisited around $0.000010 in March, April, and June and bounced each time. Those moves suggest there are price zones where demand has shown up. Analyst’s Targets And Recent History Based on reports, the analyst laid out a step-up of targets if SHIB clears its descending trendline. The first target is $0.00003364, a close to 170% rise from $0.00001249 at the time of reporting. The next level is $0.00005480, an increase of approximately 330%, and a distance benchmark at $0.00007716 suggests around 500% increase. SHIB’s own past provides some background: it climbed from $0.00000967 to $0.00004567 on March 5, 2024, on a meme-coin frenzy, and regained to $0.00003343 in December 2024 before again retreating. Models also give more modest short-term views; one forecast puts SHIB at $0.00001324 by September 17, 2025. Big swings have happened here before, but they came with heavy volume and wide attention. Related Reading: XRP’s Toughest Bull Run Could Lead To Big Gains, Analyst Claims Market Snapshot And Close Current sentiment measures look mixed. The Fear & Greed Index reads 60, which sits in the Greed zone, while technical indicators show a Bearish tilt at the moment. SHIB recorded 14/30 green days (47%) and roughly 7.02% price volatility over the last 30 days. Traders should note that those readings can flip quickly. If weekly support holds and a catalyst pushes volume up, the mood could shift. If those supports fail, the picture could darken fast. Meanwhile, volume and on-chain flows will be crucial going forward. A breakout candle that lacks rising volume may not last. Watch exchange inflows and whale transfers because large moves onto exchanges often precede selling.

For a long time, the crypto world operated with minimal oversight, leading to concerns about investor safety. However, a significant shift is underway, particularly in Illinois, where groundbreaking efforts are strengthening crypto consumer protections . This move marks a pivotal moment, setting a precedent for how states can safeguard their citizens in the rapidly expanding digital economy. Why Are Crypto Consumer Protections So Important? In the past, the lack of clear regulations in the crypto space often left consumers vulnerable. Fraud, hacks, and insufficient recourse for victims were common issues. This created an environment where trust could be easily eroded. Therefore, robust crypto consumer protections are not just about compliance; they are about building a secure and trustworthy ecosystem where individuals can engage with digital assets confidently. These new laws aim to bridge the gap between traditional financial safeguards and the innovative world of cryptocurrency. Governor JB Pritzker of Illinois recently took a decisive step, signing two crucial bills into law. These legislative actions reflect a commitment to creating a safer environment for anyone interacting with digital assets, ensuring that Illinois residents benefit from the innovation of crypto without facing undue risks. This progressive stance contrasts sharply with previous federal approaches that favored deregulation, signaling a clear direction for the state’s financial future. Unpacking the Digital Assets and Consumer Protection Act One of the cornerstone pieces of legislation is the Digital Assets and Consumer Protection Act (DACPA). This act grants significant authority to the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (IDFPR) over crypto exchanges and businesses operating within the state. The goal is to bring these digital asset firms in line with the standards expected of traditional financial institutions. Key provisions of DACPA include: Financial Safeguards: Firms must maintain adequate financial reserves to protect customer funds. Cybersecurity Measures: Strict protocols are required to prevent data breaches and unauthorized access. Anti-Fraud Measures: Companies must implement robust systems to detect and prevent fraudulent activities. Risk Disclosure: Businesses must clearly inform consumers about the inherent risks associated with crypto investments. Customer Service Standards: Companies are expected to provide responsive and effective customer support, mirroring traditional finance. This comprehensive approach to crypto consumer protections ensures that firms are accountable and that consumers have clear avenues for assistance and recourse. Regulating Crypto ATMs: The Digital Asset Kiosk Act Beyond exchanges, the second bill, the Digital Asset Kiosk Act, specifically targets the growing number of crypto ATMs. These kiosks, while convenient, have sometimes been exploited for scams, leaving victims with little recourse. Illinois is now stepping up to regulate this segment, enhancing crypto consumer protections at the point of transaction. The new regulations for crypto ATMs include: Operator Registration: All crypto ATM operators must register with the state, increasing transparency. Refund Obligations: Operators are now mandated to provide refunds to victims of scams facilitated through their kiosks. Fee Cap: A significant measure is the 18% fee cap on transactions, preventing exorbitant charges. Daily Transaction Limit: For new users, a $2,500 daily transaction limit is imposed, acting as a safeguard against large, potentially fraudulent transactions. These measures are designed to curb illicit activities and ensure fair practices for individuals using crypto ATMs, making them a safer entry point into the digital asset world. What Do These Crypto Consumer Protections Mean for You? For residents of Illinois, these new laws bring a much-needed layer of security and trust to the crypto landscape. Whether you are an experienced investor or new to digital assets, you can now interact with greater confidence, knowing that specific safeguards are in place. The state’s proactive stance on crypto consumer protections serves as a model for other jurisdictions considering how to regulate this dynamic industry effectively. Governor Pritzker emphasized that these are “common-sense protections for investors and consumers.” This legislation highlights a growing recognition among policymakers that while innovation is vital, it must be balanced with robust oversight to prevent harm. As the crypto market continues to mature, such regulatory frameworks will play a crucial role in fostering broader adoption and ensuring long-term stability. Summary of Enhanced Security Illinois has truly set a benchmark with its comprehensive approach to digital asset regulation. By signing the Digital Assets and Consumer Protection Act and the Digital Asset Kiosk Act, Governor Pritzker has championed significant crypto consumer protections . These laws not only provide clarity for businesses but also empower consumers with greater security, transparency, and recourse. This proactive legislative action is a testament to Illinois’ commitment to fostering a responsible and secure digital economy for everyone. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are the two new crypto bills signed in Illinois?

Whale wallets added 1.1 million LINK this week, showing strong confidence despite minor pullbacks. Chainlink leads RWA development with new ETF data feeds, boosting its institutional adoption narrative. Breakout Clears Long-Term Resistance Chainlink (LINK) has gained over 18% in the past week and is currently trading around $25. The move followed a breakout above a key resistance area between $20 and $21. This zone had previously rejected the price multiple times since early 2025. Notably, the breakout came with strong volume, pushing the asset well above the 200-day moving average. The green zone on the chart marked a supply region, which is now acting as support. The current structure shows price consolidating after the breakout, holding above support for now. Targets and Scenarios Analysts expect a move to $29 if the broader market holds steady. Crypto analyst Emperor said , “If BTC holds $115,000 and LINK consolidates, I expect this to move toward $29.” The chart shows that $29 marks a weekly resistance level. A pullback scenario is also possible if market sentiment weakens. “A retest of $20 could happen if there’s a slow bleed in altcoins,” the same trader added. However, due to the speed of the recent move, a sharp drop appears less likely unless broader conditions shift. Whale Accumulation on the Rise On-chain data shows a rise in large holder activity. Whale wallets have added over 1.1 million LINK in the last seven days—valued at around $27 million. Smart money addresses also increased holdings by over 12% during the same period. Source: Nansen This activity has been backed by renewed accumulation from the top 100 LINK wallets. These shifts suggest that large buyers are stepping in while the token gains momentum. Chainlink Expands Role in RWA Sector Development around real-world asset (RWA) tools is drawing attention. Chainlink has launched data feeds for U.S. equities and ETFs. One analyst posted , “Chainlink is delivering what institutions need for tokenized markets.” He added, “The LINK era is here. This is just the beginning.” The project is now ranked first in RWA development activity, according to Santiment. Chainlink’s price remains near short-term highs, with $29 in focus as the next possible resistance zone. Traders are watching price action closely as the broader altcoin market looks for direction.

This strategic pricing, designed to cater to a vast and diverse user base, marks a pivotal moment in making advanced AI tools accessible to millions across the nation. For anyone following the rapid advancements in AI, this development signals a clear intent from OpenAI to deepen its roots in key global markets, starting with India’s immense digital population. Unveiling ChatGPT GO : A Game-Changer for India’s Digital Landscape OpenAI’s latest offering, ChatGPT GO, is priced at an attractive ₹399 per month (approximately $4.60), making it significantly more affordable than the existing ChatGPT Plus Plan, which costs ₹1,999 (about $23) monthly. This new tier is not just about a lower price point; it’s about enhancing accessibility and utility for everyday users. OpenAI has also enabled local currency pricing across all its plans and, critically, integrated UPI (Unified Payment Interface) support, a widely adopted payment framework in India, ensuring seamless transactions for a vast user base. So, what exactly does ChatGPT GO offer? Nick Turley, VP at OpenAI and head of ChatGPT, highlighted several key benefits that dramatically improve upon the free tier: 10x higher message limits: Engage with ChatGPT more frequently without hitting usage caps. 10x more image generations: Unleash your creativity with significantly more AI-generated images. 10x more file uploads: Process and analyze more documents and data directly within ChatGPT. 2x longer memory retention: Enjoy more personalized and contextually aware responses over extended conversations. As Turley shared on social media, “We just launched ChatGPT Go in India, a new subscription tier that gives users in India more access to our most popular features: 10x higher message limits, 10x more image generations, 10x more file uploads, and 2x longer memory compared with our free tier. All for Rs. 399. ” This move directly addresses a key user request for more affordable access, and India has been chosen as the initial rollout market to gather crucial feedback before a potential global expansion. Why OpenAI Chose India First: A Strategic Move OpenAI’s decision to launch ChatGPT GO first in India is a testament to the country’s rapidly expanding digital footprint and its immense potential as an AI market. India boasts an internet user base exceeding 850 million, making it one of the largest and fastest-growing digital economies globally. This vast pool of users presents a unique opportunity for AI companies to scale their services. The data underscores India’s importance: according to app analytics firm AppFigures, India has emerged as the leading country for ChatGPT app downloads across platforms, accounting for over 29 million downloads in the last 90 days alone. Despite this impressive adoption rate, the app generated only $3.6 million in revenue from Indian users during the same period. This discrepancy highlights a clear demand for AI tools coupled with a need for pricing structures that align with local economic realities. OpenAI’s move directly targets this gap, aiming to convert a significant portion of its free user base into paying subscribers by offering an accessible and feature-rich plan. The company’s global user base has also seen remarkable growth, with ChatGPT now serving over 700 million weekly users worldwide, up from 500 million just a few months prior. The Rise of AI in India : A Competitive Arena OpenAI’s strategic pricing in India is not happening in a vacuum; the country’s AI landscape is becoming increasingly competitive. Other major AI players have also recognized the immense potential of the Indian market and have made their own moves to attract and retain users. For instance, last month, Perplexity AI partnered with network provider Airtel to offer free Perplexity Pro subscriptions to its users, providing advanced search and summarization capabilities. Similarly, Google has extended a free AI Pro plan for one year to India-based students, aiming to foster AI literacy and adoption among the next generation. While OpenAI’s ChatGPT GO isn’t a free offering, its highly localized and affordable pricing strategy is designed to achieve a similar outcome: driving significant subscription conversion rates by making premium AI features accessible to a broader demographic. This competitive environment ultimately benefits Indian consumers, who now have a growing array of powerful and affordable AI tools at their fingertips, accelerating the adoption and integration of AI in India across various sectors. Embracing Affordable AI : What This Means for Users The introduction of affordable AI solutions like ChatGPT GO holds transformative potential for a diverse range of users in India. For students, it means access to a powerful learning companion that can assist with research, writing, and problem-solving. For small businesses and startups, it provides a cost-effective tool for content creation, customer support, and data analysis, leveling the playing field against larger enterprises. Content creators, developers, and researchers can leverage the enhanced message limits, image generation, and memory retention to boost their productivity and innovation. This localized pricing strategy is more than just a marketing tactic; it reflects a deeper understanding of the market’s needs and purchasing power. By removing financial barriers, OpenAI is empowering millions to explore the capabilities of advanced generative AI, fostering digital literacy, and potentially sparking a wave of innovation. The ability to pay via UPI further simplifies the process, making it incredibly convenient for the average Indian user to subscribe and utilize these cutting-edge tools. The focus on better memory retention also ensures more personalized and relevant interactions, making the AI feel more like a true assistant rather than just a chatbot. Conclusion: A New Era for AI Accessibility in India OpenAI’s launch of ChatGPT GO in India marks a pivotal moment in the global push for AI accessibility. By offering an affordable, feature-rich subscription plan tailored to the Indian market, OpenAI is not only strengthening its presence but also setting a precedent for how advanced AI can be democratized in emerging economies. This move is poised to significantly boost subscription rates, accelerate AI adoption, and empower millions of new users to leverage the transformative power of artificial intelligence. As India continues to solidify its position as a global digital powerhouse, initiatives like ChatGPT GO will be crucial in shaping a future where AI is not just a luxury, but an accessible tool for everyone.

The venture capitalist, often dubbed the “SPAC King,” filed late on Monday for an initial public offering of American Exceptionalism Acquisition Corp. A. The company will seek to merge with a business operating in what he describes as his “historical areas of business expertise.” In the filing, Palihapitiya identified sectors such as artificial intelligence, decentralized finance ( DeFi ), defense robotics and energy innovations like nuclear and solar power. He wrote that these industries could be vital in “maintaining US global leadership for the next century.” NASDAQ-LISTED $ETH TREASURY FIRM BTCS $BTCS TO PAY ETH DIVIDEND AND LOYALTY BONUS TO DETER SHORT SELLERS — The Wolf Of All Streets (@scottmelker) August 19, 2025 Palihapitiya Sees DeFi Enter Next Phase The document adds that innovation in these areas depends on sustained private funding and a willingness from technology firms to list publicly, expanding access to investors. Palihapitiya has long been vocal about digital assets. He singled out DeFi, saying the next phase will involve tighter links between traditional markets and blockchain -based systems. He cited Circle’s listing and the broader adoption of stablecoins as evidence of momentum. Two-Year Window to Secure Merger Partner The SPAC has 24 months to find a merger candidate. If it succeeds, it would mark Palihapitiya’s first new deal since he shuttered two large vehicles in 2022 after failing to identify suitable partners. At the height of the SPAC frenzy, he raised 10 blank-check firms, though not all delivered. Four never completed mergers, while others, including the high-profile listings of Virgin Galactic and Clover Health, came under intense scrutiny. ‘No Crying in the Casino,’ Filing Warns His latest effort arrives as the market shows signs of life, with more than $16b raised across 81 SPACs so far this year, according to SPAC Research. The new structure marks a shift from earlier SPAC models. Importantly, the offering will not include warrants, which were once a common feature for early buyers. Instead, founder shares will still be granted. However, they will only vest if the stock rises at least 50% above the $10 IPO price. Palihapitiya said this design aims to better align with shareholder interests. The sponsor, AEXA Sponsor LLC, has committed $1.75m in a private placement.
